<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Skachko: "No Additional Powers to the </F>
President: Rukh Is Ready To Be in Opposition"] 
  [Text] Parliamentary Deputy Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader of 
the national-democratic opposition and the People's Rukh, 
corroborated his high popularity rating in the parliamentary 
elections that have been held and has already defeated 14 rivals 
in his district in the first round, garnering 62.5 percent of 
the votes. At a news conference in Kiev on 28 March 1994, he 
assessed the first round of elections as a victory for the 
national-democratic forces, inasmuch as, in his opinion, a 
majority of the candidates from the Ukraine association of 
democratic forces, of which Rukh was a member, were either 
elected in the first round or proceeded into the second. 
Vyacheslav Chornovil believes, as before, that the main 
deficiency of the election campaign was the ruinous absence of 
unity among democrats, and the main virtue of the elections was 
that the voters, despite all the cunning of "the party in power" 
and the imperfection of the majority law, were nonetheless able 
to find their bearings and cast their votes for the democrats. 
  Regarding the polls conducted by local organs of authority 
in 
the Republic of Crimea and Donetsk and Lugansk Oblasts to 
clarify the attitude of the population toward bilingualism, dual 
citizenship, and tighter integration of Ukraine in the CIS, 
Vyacheslav Chornovil declared: "Let them take polls, these polls 
do not have any legal force, this is the competence not of 
individual oblasts but of the people as a whole." With respect 
to the outbreak of pro-Russian separatism in the Crimea, 
Chornovil said that it had occurred because the economic 
situation on the peninsula is much worse than in neighboring 
Kuban or Rostov Oblast of the Russian Federation, and he 
expressed the proposition that "if the situation were better in 
Ukraine, perhaps we would be dealing with Kuban separatism, and, 
without interfering in the internal affairs of Russia, we would 
also support it." In general, Vyacheslav Chornovil acknowledged 
that the elections that were held were democratic, although the 
"number of violations exceeded the average permissible level in 
such cases in other countries. 
  Nevertheless, the news conference became not so much a 
summing up of the campaign as a definition of Rukh's plans for 
the future. Concerning the new Ukrainian Supreme Council, 
Chornovil said: "There should be a clear-cut structure in 
parliament, not an assemblage of independent deputies." But if a 
parliament is not elected, then, in the opinion of the leader of 
Rukh, the tactic of his organization will be that he will agree 
to the existence of the present Supreme Council, which "should 
not grant the president of Ukraine additional powers." 
Vyacheslav Chornovil declared that in this case the current 
parliament should adopt the so-called little constitution of 
Ukraine, that is, new laws on the presidency in Ukraine, and on 
local organs of authority and self-government; it should also 
change the majority election law to a proportional or mixed one. 
But the present law on elections, Chornovil thinks, is 
advantageous to Leonid Kravchuk, since it blocked the path to 
parliament for many political parties. Vyacheslav Chornovil let 
it be known that, as previously, Rukh remains in opposition to 
Leonid Kravchuk, but it is not insisting on presidential 
elections, inasmuch as "it is ridiculous to elect a president 
without knowing what he will be: the head of the executive 
authority, or the head of state who only receives ambassadors 
and meets with students graduating from school." Therefore, 
Chornovil declared that the reaction of Rukh in the presidential 
elections will be "calm" until such time as the president's 
powers are defined. 
  As regards strengthening the positions of the extreme 
national-radicals, Vyacheslav Chornovil said that some of their 
patriotic statements impress him; however, in the main their 
actions do not please him, since it is "always important to know 
who is leading them, when they zealously fight against both the 
communists and against, in their opinion, the rotten democrats." 
The Rukh leader asserted also that the second phase of the Rukh 
congress will be held on 15-16 April of this year; it will sum 
up the election campaign, transform Rukh into a more structured 
political party, and finally determine the strategy and tactics 
in the elections for president and to local organs of authority. 
  Afterwards, Vyacheslav Chornovil answered several questions 
from NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondents. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Do you not think that the polarization 
of Ukraine into eastern and western Ukraine will intensify after 
these elections? 
  [Chornovil] I do not think so, when I look at the lists of 
candidates that we have. Perhaps even the center of Ukraine is 
in some ways obviously getting closer to western Ukraine. This 
is a very interesting aspect. I am very troubled only by 
southeast Ukraine. Not the northeast and not the south, but 
specifically the Donbass, where the communists have won. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Is Rukh prepared at least 95 percent 
to 
switch to opposition to the existing authority in Ukraine? 
  [Chornovil] It is ready, but we still do not know what this 
authority will be. But if we form our own authority? Or if we 
are able to create a coalition? Why not go for a coalition for 
the sake of preserving the state, if there are normal forces for 
this? We only will not go for a coalition with the communists. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Can you name your probable allies? 
  [Chornovil] On economic questions we will form an alliance 
with forces from the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists, with 
its demands for partial centralization of the economy, and with 
the Labor Congress of Ukraine, with its social orientation of 
reforms. All of them have some form of reformism. The spectrum 
will be narrower on political questions: We will support an 
alliance only with other national-democratic forces. We are not 
as rigid as they, and we are for a unitary Ukraine, but also 
against all political autonomies, bilingualism, and other 
similar slogans with which some leaders of the "left" of center 
are toying. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] But what do you think of the rumors 
that are appearing that in this complicated political situation 
Rukh once again could go for definite support of the president, 
and even for an alliance with him as a bearer of executive 
authority and a potential reformer? 
  [Chornovil] Concerning cooperation with presidential 
structures, we approached the president only with a demand to 
replace some of his representatives in the localities who are 
violating the law. We never raised any questions about 
presidential representatives that Leonid Kravchuk pushed in 
everywhere who were even a little different from the purely 
Communist Party nomenklatura. I do not understand why such close 
cooperation with the president and his structures is being 
attributed to us. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Possibly this is occurring because of 
the error of the Rukh thesis about electoral opposition to 
Leonid Kravchuk? 
  [Chornovil] I do not entirely agree with this. But then why 
not? Why can an opposition not be constructive? You will recall 
how at the beginning of 1992 Leonid Kravchuk suddenly spoke 
sharply against the CIS charter, and we supported him at that 
time, but within a month we once again began to criticize him 
for inconsistency. But also within a month we declared that 
Leonid Kravchuk, after discarding the CIS charter as a document, 
was putting elements of this charter into practice. This is the 
tactic of Rukh's political struggle.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Skachko: "Opposition Must Become </F>
Radical: This Will Help the Population To Make a Choice"] 
  [Text] Since the Ukrainian Central Electoral Commission for 
elections of people's deputies still has not produced anything 
other than the preliminary results of the first round of 
parliamentary elections, practically all political forces in 
Ukraine and journalists-sociologists are currently being 
counting votes and making forecasts of the potential outcome of 
the second round of voting. At a press conference in Kiev on 30 
March Levko Lukyanenko, cochairman of the Ukraine coalition of 
democratic forces (a total of 41 public and political 
organizations), said that of the 49 new people's deputies 
elected in the first round, 24 were nominated by democrats. From 
what he said we learned that before the elections Ukraine 
coordinated the list of candidates in 360 districts, and that 
overall the democrats have been able to field candidates in 430 
out of 450 districts. Of those who will run in the second round, 
88 are candidates agreed upon by all representatives of the 
Ukraine coalition, and 94 are candidates whom the democratic 
forces nominated as a safeguard and whom Ukraine now will 
support. The main criteria of democratic credentials of the 
candidates, according to Levko Lukyanenko, is loyalty to the 
idea of Ukrainian statehood, adherence to radical economic 
reforms, active struggle against organized crime and ecological 
crimes, as well as acknowledging the need for social protection 
of low-income strata. 
  On the same day, a "roundtable" of leading sociologists, 
political scientists, and journalists was held in Kiev; its 
participants analyzed all available data on the candidates in 
the 401 remaining districts and obtained the following picture: 
of 801 candidates, 182 were nominated by democrats, 183--by 
communists, about 30--by socialists, and 83--by the Peasants 
Party. About 40 candidates were fielded by Leonid Kuchma and 
Vladimir Grinev's Interregional Reform Bloc (IBR); 140 
candidates were nominated by various bodies of authority and 
administrative structures--both soviet and presidential (this is 
the so-called "power party"). Another approximately 140 
candidates were either nominated by commercial structures or 
are, as they are called, "dark horses" behind whom there are no 
visibly identifiable influence groups and about whom one can 
only guess. 
  At the aforementioned press conference Levko Lukyanenko 
said: 
"These elections are a lesson of the past. In the future all 
democratic forces must radicalize their position with respect to 
the authorities and become a real opposition, which could serve 
as a normal mechanism of cooperation in society." 
  This sort of statement coming from one of the most 
influential leaders of the Ukrainian opposition and a similar 
position on the part of People's Rukh and other 
national-democratic organizations are very important for 
Ukraine. They inspire hope for the removal of two main 
shortcomings which to a large extent have defined the 
development of political processes over the past two to three 
years and have led to a protracted political crisis that 
threatens to grow into a constitutional one. First, close 
cooperation between the national-democratic and other opposition 
with postcommunist structures have created among the people an 
illusion of a "rejuvenated authority," which, in the 
circumstances of the absence of any significant political and 
economic reforms, resulted in the discrediting of the very idea 
of an independent Ukraine. Second, uncertainty in the ranks of 
the opposition created the absence of clear alternative 
reference points in society and scenarios for future 
development. This is especially true with respect to the 
question of economic reform. For instance, the slow 
"grabization" of state property by the nomenklatura and the 
obstacles on the road to private entrepreneurship prevented the 
creation of an attractive image of economic reforms, while 
business in the public mind today is firmly associated with the 
mafia or other manifestations of criminal activities. All these 
circumstances have led to the spread in the society of 
pessimism, apathy, and lack of confidence both in people's own 
abilities and the ability of the state and its 
political-economic institutions to change anything, which, 
naturally, creates a nourishing environment for the activities 
of various sorts of extremists offering the simplest forcible 
means of solving problems, and populists promising everything to 
everybody. It was during this time that the situation emerged 
whereby official Kiev, which keeps society from resolving 
conflicts by radical methods, became the center under attack 
both from the left--from communists, and the right--the 
national-radicals--while national-democrats and liberals of all 
colorations altogether stopped playing any perceptible role and 
influencing the pace of reforming society. The emergence of a 
well-defined opposition, which proposes its way of development 
based on faster reforms will help to structure both the 
parliament and society along the main principle: either for fast 
and productive reforms, or against them. 
  Meanwhile we have learned that many district 
commissions--for 
instance, in Kharkov Oblast--set the date for the second round 
of voting as early as 3 April, which, on one hand, does not help 
a more conscious choice, but on the other, accelerates Ukraine's 
choice on many points.

<F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Pikhovshek, Vybor, under the rubric </F>
"Whom We Elect": "Ivan Stepanovich Versus Leonid Makarovich"] 
  [Text] Against the background of Leonid Kravchuk's 
continuous statements regarding the "chaos in which the new 
Ukrainian parliament will be elected," and the 
"inappropriateness of holding presidential elections in the 
environment of instability in society," the almost demonstrative 
silence of Ivan Plyushch, the parliament speaker and Kravchuk's 
main potential rival in the elections, looks quite telling. An 
interesting trend is emerging: The more convincingly L.M. 
maintains that "parliamentary elections" will not take place 
(and the hypnotic persistence with which he keeps repeating it 
begins to border on a call to boycott the elections), the more 
Central Executive Committee Chairman Ivan Yemets and GOLOS 
UKRAINY--both subordinate to Kravchuk--print documents on the 
upcoming presidential elections. 
  It appears that Ivan Plyushch is indeed the obstacle, 
against 
which Kravchuk's hopes to ward off the new parliament's work ran 
aground. The president's game plan is becoming increasingly 
transparent by the day: to stall under any pretext--even, as 
some people on Grushevskiy Street maintain, by resorting to 
presidential rule--his own reelection; and it is only possible 
to impose such rule by provoking the population to 
nonparticipation in the elections on a massive scale. That 
Kravchuk's contention regarding a "power vacuum in the state" 
is, to put it mildly, somewhat exaggerated seems to be clear to 
everyone but the president: The old Supreme Council, in 
accordance with current legislation, retains its powers until 
the first session of the new Supreme Council. Therefore, the 
president's words may be interpreted in a purely human context, 
as an awareness as to how much a person may not want successful 
elections to the parliament, from which one may expect 
anything--for instance, reaffirming the June elections or a 
decision that Ukraine will be a parliamentary republic 
altogether. 
  The conflict between the two parts of the nomenklatura has 
reached its apogee. Ivan Stepanovich made an effort in advance 
to ensure that Kravchuk would not have substantial influence on 
the conduct of elections by, among other things, placing his own 
people in charge of electoral commissions at all levels. "The 
subsequent course of events," says a man who works on the 
speaker's staff and is knowledgeable about the rules of 
nomenklatura games, "was not difficult to foresee: Kravchuk's 
people added a great number of candidates in the districts in 
order to confuse the voters and thus get the elections 
postponed." It appears that the only factor that works for 
Kravchuk in carrying out his plan is the weather, since sunny 
days may prompt practical Ukrainians to tend to more practical 
matters than politics--for instance, vegetable gardens. There 
are some signs, however, that Plyushch's people have considered 
this possibility, too. "Ivan Stepanovich also is a skillful 
apparatchik," says my interlocutor, "and some preparations have 
been made in this respect, too" (meaning apparently the decision 
to hold the elections on any day before 10 April of this 
year--ed.). That is, as long as Plyushch can influence the 
course of elections, there is still hope that they will take 
place after all. 
  There is another substantial factor that now has been added 
to the fight for parliament seats and possibly for the right to 
be the president. The speaker's chances to claim the presidency 
are currently higher than ever. It is quite possible that his 
plans for the future presidency are the main reason why the 
Supreme Council never adopted the package of laws defining the 
functions and substantially limiting the rights of a "popularly 
elected" one. 
  Undoubtedly, in today's Ukraine Ivan Plyushch is the man who 
in real terms and to considerable degree shapes the political 
situation. He has a phenomenal memory, incredible capacity for 
work, and his skill in manipulating parliament is amazing: There 
have been practically no instances of the Supreme Council 
approving something contrary to the speaker's wish, or not 
approving something when Ivan Plyushch wanted it approved. He is 
very set in his views, and it is extraordinarily difficult to 
convince him that the opposite point of view may be the correct 
one. Only once did he admit openly at a presidium meeting that 
giving L. Kuchma's government the right to issue legislative 
acts had been a tremendous mistake on the part of himself, the 
speaker. It was easy to see with the naked eye, however, how 
hard it was for Ivan Plyushch to bring himself to admit this. 
  One can say almost with certainty that in the near future 
the 
determinant influence in Ukrainian political life will be that 
of the relations, mutual counteraction, and tactical compromises 
between the parliamentary and executive nomenklatura groups 
headed by L. Kravchuk and I. Plyushch. 
  Comparing their chances, one observes first and foremost 
that 
the president is playing for "maintaining" the situation on the 
current level, and as is known, he who stays in place loses more 
often. Ivan Plyushch, however, is very interesting now in his 
silent importance--the eloquent silence of a man who is 
stubbornly climbing to the pinnacle of power.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Plyushch, chairman of the Ukrainian </F>
Supreme Council, by Aleksandr Sokol, parliamentary 
correspondent: "Whoever Has the Power Has the Keys to Paradise. 
And These Keys Are Granted by the People. Let Us Remember That 
When Electing Parliament on 10 April and the President of 
Ukraine on 26 June: Ivan Plyushch: 'We Must Bring New Blood to 
Power As Quickly As Possible'"] 
  [Text] As we know, Supreme Soviet Council Ivan 
Plyushch won the elections. And convincingly--he received more 
than 71 percent of the votes. But that was not the event that 
attracted general attention. What got people stirred up was 
Plyushch's appeal not to postpone the presidential elections but 
to conduct them, as decreed by the Supreme Council, on 26 June 
of this year. 
  Before that, a different opinion had been expressed. 
Leonid Kravchuk, television, and many political figures had 
asserted and are still trying to prove that presidential 
elections on the scheduled date would be if not fatal then at 
least inexpedient. The unexpected statement from the head of 
parliament, understandably, elicited various interpretations. 
Aleksandr Sokol decided to go to him for clarification. 
  [Sokol] Ivan Stepanovich! Having expressed your opinion 
about 
the presidential elections next to the ballot box, you then 
repeated it on television. Do you really think that under 
current conditions presidential elections are possible and 
necessary? 
  [Plyushch] I do not think we can continue to mark time; we 
must finally carry out the reforms. Both political and economic. 
People involved with politics and economics understand that 
these spheres of activity are interconnected. Not so long ago we 
were saying: First political reforms and then economic. Today we 
are exclaiming: "The economy is the root of all evil!" But to an 
unprejudiced person it is clear that we have no national economy 
because we have not carried out political reforms. 
  I am profoundly convinced that there is a limit to 
everything. There was one for the Supreme Council elected in 
1990 as well. Because in addition to the fact that today's state 
of affairs caused the people to be dissatisfied with it, other 
problems arose as well: Who was elected how, at what time, under 
what system, in what state, etc., etc. I think the deputies 
adopted the only correct decision: to schedule the elections 
early. But this demand was also made to the executive power, to 
the president. 
  Leonid Makarovych and I had no differences of opinion 
regarding the idea that we should adopt a decree concerning both 
the Supreme Council and the president simultaneously. As we 
know, it was duly adopted. And suddenly there is this turn. 
  There is nothing surprising about the fact that the 
president's apparatus and his local structures are trying to 
stay as long as possible. That is a natural process. Something 
else is confusing. 
  After the law on the formation of new regional organs of 
power was adopted, after this was ordered by the president, a 
frenzied campaign developed regarding this law. The were looking 
for flaws, dramatizing the fact that the time of the elections 
coincides with a busy time for agricultural work, sending 
telegrams, working on the structures. Things reached a point 
where the president's representative stated at an official 
conference: The person who put this law through is a criminal. 
Since the person in charge of the conference did not say 
anything, the speaker clarified: This was done by Plyushch... 
  The rumor was spread that some kind of revenge was planned. 
But can we allow such a malicious fabrication?! This has to do 
with something altogether different. If we want reform, if we 
want to improve our lives, we need the appropriate people--from 
the chairman of the rural soviet to the head of parliament, from 
the brigade leader to the prime minister. And we must be 
concerned about people like that. And in the shortest amount of 
time, without getting bogged down in elections. 
  Elections are not an end in themselves, not a means of 
settling scores. The authorities must be elected locally. They 
are the expression of the will of the people. From 27 March 
through 10 April they must entrust the power to the legislators, 
and on 26 June--to the executive structures. If this is done 
Ukraine will for the first time have a power actually created by 
the people. Those at the helm will be obligated to act and 
justify this confidence. Now let us imagine that nothing were to 
happen. The authorities would be sitting there in suspense... 
  [Sokol] But what about the provision of the law that says 
that the presidential election campaign should begin four months 
before the elections? After all, it is too late for that. 
  [Plyushch] This legal norm was written for normal life. We 
are living under the conditions of an ever deepening crisis. If 
we stick to formalities, then 26 June is indeed an unrealistic 
date for presidential elections. But if we are guided by higher 
interests and take reality into account, we can find a solution. 
All we have to do is want it. Moreover, the presidential 
election campaign began a long time ago, back when both inside 
and outside parliament there was the threatening demand: "Down 
with the Supreme Council!" "Down with the president!" There is 
quite enough time to nominate candidates and discuss them. 
  But I do not want to link the need for forthcoming changes 
to 
the presidential elections alone. The authorities must be 
elected locally. That is the main thing. A situation like the 
one we have now should not be. And just look--they are blaming 
Kravchuk and Plyushch for everything. Because of them the buses 
are not running, there is no control over trade in medicine, 
they registered many unneeded small enterprises, they created a 
sea of booths, they reduced the people to poverty. And so forth 
and so on. They themselves did this, they used up their time, 
and now they are looking for someone to blame. They used to damn 
the party, the administrative system, and now they have decided 
to heap everything on the party in power even though they 
themselves belong to it... 
  The longer the situation continues, the greater will be the 
uncertainty in the society, and irresponsibility and other 
negative phenomena will increase. 
  [Sokol] If you do not object, let us return to the 
presidential elections. How can we elect one if we do not know 
his ultimate status and authority? 
  [Plyushch] It is true, legislation does not clearly indicate 
what kind of future president and new government we should have. 
But the Supreme Council has already considered the 
constitutional foundations of the organization of power in 
Ukraine. They decided that the new members would dot all the 
i's. The newly elected deputies would determine, in particular, 
whether the prime minister would be the head of the executive 
power or if everything would remain as it is: The president both 
the head of the state and the head of the executive power. It 
would not take as much time to resolve this problem as some 
people think. 
  The result will depend on the political forces that come to 
parliament. I am convinced that the executive power should be 
concentrated in one set of hands. The president could be in 
charge of it. But then he must head up the government. In this 
case there is no need for a prime minister. This is the 
presidential form of government chosen recently in Belarus. 
  It exists in America as well, and it has for a long time. 
But 
we also have experience: Over two years we have seen that with 
the kind of system we have now nobody is responsible for the 
state of affairs in the country. Therefore I will repeat once 
again: There is no need to make a lot of noise and postpone the 
new elections; instead we should prepare for them. There is time 
enough for that. 
  [Sokol] Ivan Stepanovich! But it is also possible to have a 
situation where Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk could say that the 
decision of the early elections was unconstitutional. There are 
grounds for such a statement. 
  [Plyushch] But he signed the law on this... 
  [Sokol] And the last thing. There is reason to think that 
the 
elections will not be held on 26 June anyway. By insisting on 
your position, are you not risking a certain amount of your 
authority? 
  [Plyushch] I am. But that is not the essential thing. The 
main thing is to change the situation for the better. And as 
quickly as possible. The situation will depend on many factors. 
If I end up alone, it will be a voice howling in the desert. 
  You are well aware of my position regarding the election of 
the new members of the Supreme Council. There was so much 
shouting: "The elections will not take place!" I will not even 
consider the idea that the people will not come to them. Even 
what we have today is an important political victory. All we 
have to do is bring things to completion. 
  Today people have started saying that the people can make 
the 
best choice. Yes, they can. But they will never make the 
mistakes of which a single person is capable. If we allow an 
individual to have the power--there will be immeasurably more 
mistakes.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Parties Lack Great Influence in the </F>
Sub-Carpathian Region"] 
  [Text] Analysis of the percentages of voters who took part 
in the first round of the parliamentary elections and who cast 
their ballots for the nominees of this or that party in the 
various districts leads us to conclude that in Ivano-Frankivsk 
Oblast (in contrast to Lviv and Ternopil oblasts) most parties 
do not enjoy substantial influence. 
  The only party which does have such influence in some places 
is the KUN [expansion not given]. Its local leader, Roman 
Krutsyk, garnered 58.4 percent of the votes in the Rogatynskyy 
Election District. Two KUN members received 45 percent together 
in the Rozhnyativskyy Election District (of the two, Orest 
Dychkovskyy obtained 30.2 percent). In four other districts the 
KUN candidates received from 5.3 to 6.6 percent. The KUN 
demonstrated a great deal of authority and discipline when--upon 
the demand or request of the regional leadership--five 
candidates of this party (among them was the first deputy 
minister of culture and former chairman of the oblast council, 
Mykola Yakovyna) a few days before the elections withdrew their 
candidacies in order to benefit the other KUN people (only one 
person refused to do so). 
  Ranking second in the percentages of votes received was the 
Communist-Socialist Bloc. As predicted at the beginning of March 
by the observer of the communist newspaper, PRYKARPATSKA PRAVDA, 
specifically in the Central Election District of the oblast 
center, which is inhabited by a large number of Russian-speaking 
people--as well as by military-service personnel and army 
veterans--the candidate of the left-wing forces (the editor of 
this very same newspaper, Bohdan Fedkiv) received the highest 
percentage of votes in the oblast--a total amounting to 20 
percent (the only readon that he did not make it to the second 
round was because of the clear victory of his 
opponent--Volodymyr Pylypchuk--who won the election). In the 
Zaliznychyy Election District of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast the 
left-wing candidates (the private entrepreneur Dmytro Shlemko 
and the worker Volodymyr Baranyshyn) garnered a total of 10.1 
percent of the votes. In the four other districts left-wingers 
obtained totals ranging from 1 to 9.8 percent (the former first 
secretary of the KPU [Ukrainian Communist Party] Obkom, Zynoviy 
Kuravskyy, whose victory in the Snyatynskyy Election District 
the communists were counting upon, received only 8 percent). 
  The chairman of the UNA [Ukrainian National Assembly] Kiev 
Committee, Serhiy Hrinchuk, garnered 17.3 percent of the votes 
in the Dolynskyy Election District, while two other UNA 
candidates in Kolomiya and Kosova received 2.6 and 2.8 percent 
respectively. 
  The head of the so-called "National Movement of Ukraine)," 
Borys Holodyuk, received 14.6 percent of the votes in the 
Zaliznychyy Election District of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, while 
his comrades-in-arms in the Central and Nadvirnyanskyy election 
districts garnered 0.5 and 1.5 percent respectively. 
  The head of the regional organization of the NRU [People's 
Movement of Ukraine (Rukh)] (the Chornovol-led group), Ivan 
Shovkovyy, received 7 percent of the votes in the Kolomyyskyy 
Election District, while 6 other NRU candidates obtained from 
0.9 to 3.8 percent (most of them are employed within the state 
administrative system). 
  The leaders of the Ukrainian Christian Democratic Party 
(UCDP), which functions de fact only in this oblast--the 
Sichkos, father and son--received 1.9 and 2.1 percent 
respectively. 
  Deputies of the previous convocation of the VRU [Ukrainian 
Supreme Council] obtained the following percentages of votes in 
this oblast: the chairman of the oblast council, Stepan 
Volkovetskyy--61.2 percent; Pavlo Movchan--57.9 percent; 
Volodymyr Pylypchuk--57.6 percent; Dmytro Zakharuk--3.1 percent; 
Vasyot Kostytskyy--27 percent (first round); Petro 
Osadchuk--30.2 percent; Lyubomyr Pyrih--21.2 percent; Volodymyr 
Shlemko--7.7 percent; Zynoviy Duma--5.68 percent; and Bohdan 
Rebryk--1.1 percent. 
  The hetman of the Ukrainian Cossacks, Major-General 
Volodymyr 
Mulyava, garnered 63.48 percent of the votes; the head of the 
Union of Repressed Ukrainians, Yevgen Propyuk, received 52.1 
percent; the minister of the economy, Roman Shpek received 34.1 
percent; the former commander of the Ukrainian Navy, 
Vice-Admiral Borysk Kozhyn, obtained 22.3 percent; and the 
deputy minister of energy and electrification, Zynoviy Butso, 
obtained 12.3 percent.

<F P=106> [Report by V.P. Voytenko and Ye.M. Libmanova (Based on </F>
Materials of the Ecodefencinform Agency): "Mortality and Life 
Expectancy in Ukraine"] 
  [Text] A conference entitled "Ecology, Health, and 
Old Age" was held quite recently at the Gerontology Institute of 
the Ukrainian Academy of Medical Sciences in Kiev. Taking part 
in this conference's work were staffers of the scientific organs 
under the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences and Academy of Medical 
Sciences, as well as those from the Ukrainian Ministry of 
Education. Twelve reports by prominent specialists in the fields 
of ecology, medicine, and gerontology were discussed here. The 
conference's goal was to thoroughly analyze the consequences of 
the ecological situation which has evolved in Ukraine and which 
has evoked deep concern. This conference also had the goal of 
discussing possible ways to extricate ourselves from this 
crisis-type situation. The initiator for holding this 
conference--the Gerontology Institute--hopes and anticipates 
that the most adequate ways will be found for overcoming the 
symptoms which menace our nation's health. This hope likewise 
unites the efforts of scientists in various fields and 
practicing specialists. 
  Press Center of the Ukrainian Health Center 
  According to data published by the World Health Organization 
in 1990, Ukraine ranks 45th out of 65 countries in average life 
expectancy for women, and it ranks 54th for men. 
  The principal cause of death in Ukraine consists of diseases 
of the circulatory system. Our fellow-countrymen are dying from 
these diseases not only more freqently, but also earlier: The 
greatest losses of life--as compared with our foreign 
counterparts--occur between the ages of 45 and 65. Of particular 
significance are deaths from cardiovascular diseases in 
Zarkarpat, Ivano-Frankovsk, Chernovtsy, Dnepropetrovsk, Donetsk, 
and Zaporozhye oblasts, as well as throughout the entire 
territory of Southern Ukraine. 
  Ranking second in importance as a cause of death 
(contributed 
to by pollution of the environment and by tobacco smoking) are 
malignant new growths--tumors and cancers. Kiev, as well as the 
industrial oblasts of the western and southern regions, have 
become particularly hazardous with regard to such oncological 
diseases. 
  Ranking third are accidents, poisonings, and injuries. The 
number of injury-caused deaths--which was reduced by the 
short-term success of the anti-alcohol campaign--has begun to 
increase again since 1988. 
  Increasing the life expectancy in Ukraine is possible 
provided that there are changes in the mortality structure. In 
the first place, what we are talking about here is a reduction 
in the role played by deaths from infectious diseases and 
injuries. In the second place, it is a matter of reducing the 
average number of deaths from cardiovascular and oncological 
diseases. Successfully performing both of these tasks is 
connected--in one way or another--with solving our economic 
problems. An increase in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 
personal consumption (PC) by 1,000 "international dollars" would 
allow an increase in life expectancy of 0.5 years for men and 1 
year for women. But this ratio is not absolute. The greatest 
life expectancy is not in the United States (which ranks first 
in personal consumption), but rather in Japan (which ranks 22nd 
in personal consumption). That is to say, extra-ecological 
factors are also of essential importance, in particular, life 
style and the nature (not merely the quantity) of the personal 
consumption involved. This furnished optimism for those who are 
poor. 
  Most urgent for Ukraine is investing in the preservation and 
safeguarding of nature, even though restoring the environment to 
good health will not have an effect on mortality very soon. 
<H8>  Prognosis </H8>
  The Central Region (the city of Kiev, as well as 
Poltava, Chernigov, Zhitomir, Sumy, Cherkassy, Vinnitsa, and 
Kiev oblasts) is characterized by a relatively favorable 
mortality structure-one closely approximating international 
standards. Serving as a foreign analogue to the mortality 
pattern here could be Belgium during the early 1960's (for men) 
and during the late 1970's (for women). 
  The Western Region (Lvov, Khmelnitskiy, Chernigov, 
Ivano-Frankovsk, Ternopol, Volyn, Rovno, and Zakarpat oblasts) 
slightly exceeds the average level for Ukraine with regard to 
life expectancy; however, it is progressing quite slowly. The 
unfavorable mortality trends in Zakarpat Oblast provide grounds 
for doubting the reliability of the health statistics in this 
oblast, as well as in Ivano-Frankovsk and Volyn oblasts. Among 
the European countries an analogue may be seen with France 
during the early 1960's (for men) and during the late 1960's 
(for women). 
  The Eastern Region (Donetsk, Dnepropetrovsk, 
Kharkov, and Lugansk oblasts) is characterized not only by a 
high present-day level of mortality, but also by a stagnation of 
its basic indicators during the last 10 years. It is analogous 
to Finland during the early 1970's. 
  The Southern Region (Crimea, as well as Kherson, 
Kirovograd, Nikolayev, and Odessa oblasts) is the most 
unfavorable zone. In fact, it is a zone of increased risk for 
health and life (especially the maritime rayons of Kherson and 
Odessa oblasts). The closest analogue is Spain during the late 
1950's (for men) and the late 1960's (for women).

<F P=106> [Interview with State Duma Deputy Anatoliy Lukyanov, Russian </F>
Road group, by Viktoria Rabotnova; place and date not given: 
"Prepare for October in the Spring"] 
  [Text] [Lukyanov] Civil peace is not all-forgiveness or 
universal fraternization. True patriots, our people, will never 
agree to make peace with those who have shell-blasted the 
parliament and the constitution. There will be no accord on this 
count. 
  Overall, accord in a society that is splitting into the poor 
and the rich is difficult. It is impossible to reconcile these 
contradictions on the social plane, but it is possible and 
necessary to attempt to resolve them without armed conflicts and 
bloodshed. Most people, including the communists, support 
precisely this. Such accord assumes a whole series of actions 
aimed at resolving all issues by consensus. 
  [Rabotnova] In other words, for you accord does not mean 
giving up the struggle? 
  [Lukyanov] One may wish for anything. But try to reconcile 
the poor--and even according to government data 38 percent of 
the Russian population live below the poverty level--with a 
handful of new millionaires. But we have to act within the 
bounds of the constitution. 
  [Rabotnova] Which constitution? 
  [Lukyanov] Even this one, essentially not adopted because 
only one-third of the population voted for it in the referendum. 
The struggle must be conducted by legal means. There are ways: 
strikes; speaking up against the regime in the press. 
  [Rabotnova] Your forecast: How will events develop from here 
on? 
  [Lukyanov] It all depends on the correlation of forces; on 
how realistically the president and his entourage appraise the 
current situation. Unless shock therapy is rejected; unless the 
reforms become at least minimally socially oriented, October may 
shift to other months...

<F P=106> [Interview with State Duma Deputy Gleb Yakunin, Russia's </F>
Choice faction, by Viktoria Rabotnova; place and date not given: 
"Rejection of Class Struggle"] 
  [Text] [Yakunin] For us, democrats, the president's civil 
accord proposal was unexpected. I think there is only one sphere 
of life where such an accord may be attempted. It is an 
agreement for all political forces--first and foremost 
communists, patriots, and Zhirinovskiy followers--to give up the 
class struggle and violent methods. 
  That the president expressed a wish to consolidate society 
is 
wonderful. But realization of this idea requires systematic 
meetings with trade unions, including those in opposition; 
political parties; culture figures; and representatives of 
different religious confessions--not just the patriarch. Without 
a continuous dialogue, it will all end up as a purely 
propagandistic action. 
  I think that the practical result could resemble that in 
Spain, provided we were already in a state of getting out of the 
crisis... 
  [Rabotnova] But in Spain the victors forgave the defeated. 
What about here? 
  [Yakunin] We, the president's supporters, criticize him 
bitterly and tell the truth in that he has not implemented 
deep-reaching reforms, has not pushed through a law on vetting, 
and that for all practical purposes the current winners in our 
country are the army of bureaucrats. They will try to stay in 
power at any price, solidify it. And this is probably the 
greatest danger for democracy today.

other traditional spheres of employment of the northern peoples, 
and the preservation of uniquely northern farming methods; 
  the augmentation of the export potential of the economy for 
the development of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) and the Russian 
Federation; 
  the resolution of demographic problems, the problems of the 
population of some northern regions of the Sakha Republic 
(Yakutia), and employment problems and the elevation of the 
standard of living. 
  3. The projects and undertakings envisaged by the program

<F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Mogil: There Is Money. We Await the </F>
Elections"] 
  [Text] In order to report on the trip to the Central 
Election Commission in Moscow and answer questions that had 
accumulated during their absence, Chairman of the Kray Election 
Commission S. Knyazev and Ye. Khrustalev assembled journalists 
in the White House the day before yesterday. 
  It appears from what they said that the decision of the 
governor of the kray concerning delaying the elections to the 
kray Duma until autumn made sense to the Central Election 
Commission. They also did not fail to pay attention to the 
financial needs of Maritime Kray regarding the conduct of 
elections. The necessary amount of money was released. Thus, the 
kray election commission was able to return half a billion 
rubles [R] to the kray budget, from where the money was borrowed 
to finance the initial stages of the election campaign, and 
which the governor also promised to release for social programs. 
  S. Knyazev dispelled the concerns of journalists about the 
safekeeping of the money allocated for the elections postponed 
until autumn. But so that the millions will be safer, he will 
probably even cancel a trip to Moscow, where on 20 April the 
Supreme Court plans to examine an appeal filed by Messrs 
Gilgenberg, Kandarakov, and Isayev concerning the, in their 
opinion, improper cutting up of electoral districts. According 
to the law, the complaint can be examined even in the absence of 
representatives of the kray election commission. 
  As for the Supreme Court finding on the essence of the 
complaint, the delay of the elections to a later date only 
contributes to objectivity. In the words of S. Knyazev, such a 
subjective factor as an already elected kray Duma would 
complicate the work of justice. 
  Mentioning that we all walk under God, the visitors 
explained 
the situation regarding the candidates for deputy who are 
already registered. This is how matters stand: If 55 days before 
the scheduled date of the elections there are less than two 
candidates for deputy in any electoral district for any reason 
whatsoever, a prenomination mandatory collection of signatures 
will be held as before. 
  It was decided not to change the composition of the kray and 
district election commissions. They will continue their work.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ilya Grinchenko, chairman of the kray </F>
organizational committee of the Russia's Choice Movement, by 
Vitaliy Mogil; place and date not given: "Orientation Points of 
the New Party: Maritime Kray Gaydar Supporters Plan To Defend 
Civic Peace and the Interests of the Residents of the Kray"] 
  [Text] A long time ago journalists used to "pester" 
the leader of Russia's Choice, Ye. Gaydar, with the question: 
Are you not planning to transform this bloc of yours into a 
party? Yegor Timurovich never ruled out such a possibility. And 
so, it has happened--Russia's Choice will create a party. 
Supporters were found for it here in Maritime Kray. 
  Our KRASNOYE ZNAMYA correspondent met with Ilya 
Grinchenko, chairman of the kray organizational committee of the 
Russia's Choice Movement. 
  [Mogil] Ilya Konstantinovich, the political announcement on 
the creation of a party, which was published in ARGUMENTY I 
FAKTY and signed by its leaders, states that the party is being 
created as a counterweight to the threat of a nomenklatura 
revanche and the accession to power of national-extremists. Does 
such a threat also exist in Maritime Kray? 
  [Grinchenko] Maritime Kray is still not a separate republic. 
But in Russia such a danger is viewed as obvious, and this means 
that our kray is also not secure from it. But even this is not 
the main reason for the creation of a party. Russia's Choice 
will fight not against, but for. For a free society where human 
rights are the highest priority, for stability, for an effective 
state, and for civic peace. 
  [Mogil] The establishment of civic peace and the creation of 
a free society, it must be assumed, are a program maximum. But 
the minimum? 
  [Grinchenko] For Maritime Kray supporters of People's 
Choice, 
this is a struggle for authority in all representative organs in 
order to defend the interests of the residents of our kray. 
  [Mogil] Can we also expect your candidates in the 
forthcoming 
elections to the kray Duma? 
  [Grinchenko] We have supporters among already nominated 
candidates for deputy. But if the Statute on Elections is 
revised and the opportunity appears to nominate new candidates, 
then we will do this. 
  [Mogil] Who was the initiator for the creation of the party 
in Maritime Kray? 
  [Grinchenko] The slogans under which the new party is being 
created found support among members of the Democrat Club--people 
of a different political orientation. Among them are 
social-democrats, supporters of the Russia's Choice Movement, 
and people with no party affiliation. 
  [Mogil] Will they all now become Gaydarites? 
  [Grinchenko] The party has not yet been formed structurally. 
Its constituent assembly is planned for the end of May. Until 
that time it will be necessary to consider the draft charter and 
a political statement. After the congress, party supporters will 
be able to formulate their attitude toward the documents 
developed by it at constituent meetings in the localities. 
Moreover, participation in the activity of the Russia's Choice 
Movement is not limited to party membership. 
  [Mogil] The party has just been formed, but it has already 
actively joined the political life of the kray... 
  [Grinchenko] Yes. On behalf of the kray organizational 
conference of the Russia's Choice Movement, an appeal has been 
sent to the governor of Maritime Kray with a proposal to form a 
kray public chamber (as a consultative representational organ 
under the kray administration) consisting of registered 
candidates for deputy for the period before the election of the 
kray Duma. We think that this could become the first step in the 
establishment of civic peace and accord in Maritime Kray, and we 
declare our readiness to render support in the implementation of 
our proposal.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, governor of Maritime </F>
Kray, by Yelena Belykh: "Extricating Ourselves From the 
Captivity of Dead Schemes"] 
  [Text] Despite all of life's burdens which fall to 
the lot of the "average" Maritimer, one virtue of existence in 
the province by the sea is indisputable--things are tranquil 
here. The political battles in the capital roll down to us in 
gentle waves, fortunately. But the social peace is fragile. 
  In terms of per capita income the Maritime area is in last 
place in the region. The gap between rich and poor is growing. A 
bank employee receives 2.5 times more than a worker, three times 
more than a teacher, and four times more than a peasant. The two 
minimums--wage and subsistence--differ from one another tens of 
times over. How to beat back the wave of growing social tension 
and prevent the eruption of a "rebellion senseless and 
pitiless"? Our correspondent took this question to a surgery on 
personal matters at the residence of Ye. Nazdratenko, governor 
of the kray. 
  [Belykh] Yevgeniy Ivanovich, on her resignation Ella 
Pamfilova, minister of social protection, told the press that 
she could not deceive people. The government was adopting 
another decree, as a result of which a quantity of watermarked 
notes would be printed. They are distributed to the poor, but 
frequently only when prices have exceeded the posted price many 
times over. What is there for needy Maritimers to hope for? 
  [Nazdratenko] The realism of government decrees is a painful 
subject. Is there, say, a decree on privileges for the 
casualties from the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power 
Station? Yes, and very handsome it is. Has the government 
allocated the region money? Not one ruble. People are coming to 
us, to the administration, for help--there is no money. Is there 
a decree on officers discharged into the reserve, on apartments 
being built for them? Yes. And there is inflation, which is 
devouring the funds which were at one time allocated. One 
apartment instead of five--that's the arithmetic. The list could 
be continued ad infinitum. Take if only the first edict of the 
president on education and the way it has been fulfilled. 
  All this cannot fail to stoke the people's exasperation. 
This 
runs counter to my inner convictions, incidentally. Remember one 
of the numerous promises of Gaydar--the favorite of young people 
and the West, the personification of progressive thinking? "Only 
bikers will feel the increase in the price of fuel." It has been 
felt by retirees--the most defenseless group of society. We, the 
kray, have been able to cover them, reduce the prices, and allow 
gasoline benefits. We are posting the militia, we are posting 
the Special Militia so that the elderly individual may fill up 
in peace and not be humiliated by the "leather" boys. And? He 
rides away, and half a kilometer further on that same junior 
mafioso stops him and siphons off the gasoline. Who is to blame? 
  [Belykh] Nazdratenko, naturally. When people voted for the 
new constitution, for continuation of the reforms, they voted 
for you also. 
  [Nazdratenko] I am not sure that if a ballot were conducted 
now, I would collect as many white balls. But I would ask people 
to believe in one thing--the sincerity of my motives when I 
attempt to do something. We are working on a decree on the 
economic status of the kray. We are not demanding direct 
financial infusions into a moribund economy. But release us from 
the captivity of dead schemes born of anonymous government 
officials somewhere in Moscow! Afford us an opportunity to 
manage preferential quantity regulation and licensing! The 
Yaroslavskiy Mining and Concentrating Works is at a 
standstill--people have no earnings, the community is dying. 
Grant it the opportunity to sell products in a profitable 
manner, and people will have money. Money, not "compensation 
payments." The infrastructure would be restored, the social 
sphere would revive. 
  [Belykh] The same hopes were placed in Government Decree 
1001. 
  [Nazdratenko] True. But who torpedoed this decree? It was 
buried here, in the Maritime region, by Bytov and Cherepkov. I 
was accused of blackmailing the government. The same thing will 
probably be repeated with the decree. According to the 
principle: "If a man exists, you can pin something on him." The 
business of the tanker filled with radioactive waste. 
"Nazdratenko is lobbying a Japanese company!" Very well, you 
don't want a cleanup by the Japanese for free, within 20 days? 
Accept the alternative--18 months of construction for over $2 
million. But the kray would not pay this. I have no intention of 
taking crumbs from pensions and children's compensation to pay 
some firm in Moscow for secretaries and private residences. 
  Yes, I am a lobbyist. I lobby for the interests of the 
Maritimers. Only not those who roll around in Mercedes and talk 
with competitors in the language of lampoons and grenades. The 
interests of normal working people, who bring their troubles to 
my surgery. Whom we, the authorities, are required to provide 
with a normal peaceful life.

<F P=106> [I. Mikhaylov report: "In the Sea of Japan, for All That!: </F>
That's Where Our Liquid Radioactive Waste Will End Up, It Would 
Seem"] 
  [Text] Journalists of Vladivostok and also foreign 
correspondents accredited in the kray center satisfied 
themselves of this once again at a news conference conducted by 
Ye. Stomatyuk, chairman of the Natural Resources Committee of 
the administration of the kray. It is he, incidentally, who was 
head of the kray interdepartmental commission inspecting the 
state of radiation safety in the handling of radioactive waste 
at the Zvezda Plant, which was in the city of Bolshoy Kamen on 
30 March of this year. 
  Quite a lot has already been written about this problem 
(KRASNOYE ZNAMYA of 17 February, "Nuclear Scrapes," and of 31 
March, "Large Dollar Sum for Moscow," and a mass of publications 
in the local and central papers), and I will emphasize merely 
that the above commission reached yet again the conclusion 
concerning the impossibility of the storage of liquid 
radioactive waste in the current tanks in direct proximity to a 
center of population. The situation has deteriorated 
particularly at TNT-5, at which leaks were discovered. A real 
threat of radioactive contamination hangs over the waters of the 
Gulf of Ussuriysk and Bolshoy Kamen Bay, especially since the 
development of an emergency situation is expected in April-May 
with the arrival of settled warmth. 
  The commission recommended in May that the liquid 
radioactive 
waste be dumped in the Sea of Japan at the points determined in 
the 1980's. It had not been considered possible doing this 
earlier on account of the fact that the liquid radioactive waste 
had frozen to a thickness of 60-70 cm. And, second, the urgent 
building of repositories and an industrial plant for 
decontaminating and reprocessing the liquid radioactive waste. 
  The first recommendation could be canceled if in the very 
near future Moscow either allocates the funds for the designated 
construction or permits Japanese firms to embark on the 
realization of their own proposals. In this case the tankers 
would temporarily be taken to a place presenting no danger to 
people's lives. 
  Journalists had attempted to take part in the work of the 
commission, incidentally, but the Pacific Fleet representative 
barred them from the liquid radioactive waste storage sites. And 
the question at the news conference as to whether the Pacific 
Fleet would submit to a decision of the administration on the 
dumping of liquid radioactive waste in the Sea of Japan if such 
were adopted was not inappropriate in this connection. According 
to the constitution, the fleet is required to submit inasmuch as 
local authorities are entitled, when it comes to questions of 
the environment, to adopt independent decisions. But Russia has 
yet to act so rectilinearly in accordance with the law. It is 
not known what Moscow will tell the Pacific Fleet. 
  The work force of the Zvezda Plant and the population of the 
city of Bolshoy Kamen will have something to say also, for that 
matter. Their opinion cannot be relegated to the last positions, 
I believe.

Center for the Employment of the Population Department of Labor 
Market Analysis and Employment Programs: "The Number of 
Unemployed Is Growing (Analysis of 1991-1994 Data From the 
Oblast Center for the Employment of the Population)"] 
  [Text] The number of unemployed people is growing in the 
rayons of the oblast. In 1993, 13,500 unemployed were put on the 
rolls there, and in the preceding year, 7,000. 
  Last year, 7,600 unemployed were put on the rolls, compared 
to 9,300 in 1992. 
  For the January-February period of 1994, the number of 
unemployed put on the rolls, compared to the corresponding 
period of last year, came to 155.7 percent in the rayons of the 
oblast, 122.0 percent in Novosibirsk, and 142.4 percent in the 
oblast as a whole. 
  The competition among the unemployed for vacant jobs is 
growing, especially in the rayons of the oblast. As of 1 March 
1993, 21 unemployed claimed each vacant job in the oblast 
rayons, compared to six; as of the corresponding date of last 
year in the city of Novosibirsk, accordingly, one and three, and 
in the oblast as a whole, three and four unemployed per vacant 
job. 
  The proportion of unemployed residing in rural areas 
increased in 1993 (from 12.7 percent as of 1 January to 21.7 
percent on 31 December). Those who had previously worked in the 
national economy accounted for 86 percent of the total number of 
unemployed. On the whole, the following dynamics of the 
qualitative composition of the unemployed people has been 
registered: 


                                1-1-93                  1-1-94 

a) by reason for unemployment 
(percentages): 

--laid-off employees            62.8                    45.0 

--quit of their own will        22.4                    39.3 

--dismissed for violations of   0.7                     1.6 
labor discipline 

--college graduates             9.2                     11.3 

b) by age: 

--young people between 16 and   32.1                    34.5 
29 

--individuals close to          5.3                     6.7 
retirement age 

c) those who have had a break   12.5                    22.6 
in work of more than one year 
and those who have not 
previously embarked on labor 
activities 

d) those without profession     7.2                     12.7 
or occupation 

e) by the duration of 
unemployment 

--eight months or longer        3.9                     31.6 


  Higher requirements by employers with regard to the level of 
qualification of the employees and newly hired citizens have 
hampered job placement activities on behalf of the groups of 
population in particular need of social protection. It is 
obvious that the number of parents rearing minor or congenitally 
handicapped children, single parents, and parents of many 
children increased in 1993 among the unemployed precisely in 
conjunction with this. 
  Last year, the number of unemployed parents rearing minor 
children, as well as congenitally handicapped children, in the 
oblast increased from 4,300 to 5,500 people, and that of parents 
of many children, from 312 to 524 persons, respectively. This 
growth occurred only in the rayons (cities) of the oblast, 
whereas the number of such persons in Novosibirsk virtually did 
not change (2,400 people). 
  The proportion of parents who have minor children or 
congenitally handicapped children, in the total number of 
unemployed is greater in the rayons of the oblast than in 
Novosibirsk, and comes to 42.4 percent and 41.6 percent, 
respectively. 
<H5>  Refugees and Forced Resettlers </H5>
  In 1993, the employment service of the oblast registered a 
total of 145 such citizens, including 103 women. Thirty-five 
persons were placed in jobs, including 24 women. 
<H5>  The Size of Unemployment Benefits </H5>
  The average annual size of unemployment benefits in 
Novosibirsk Oblast, with payments for all dependents (including 
children), came to 2,385 rubles [R] in 1992, and R24,627 per 
unemployed person in 1993. The allowance for each dependent 
comes to 10 percent of the size of the benefit. 
<H5>  The Results of the Implementation of the Main Provisions of </H5>
Employment Programs for 1993 
  A certain relaxation of strains on the labor market of the 
oblast in 1993 was the main result of carrying out the program 
for facilitating the employment of the population. Last year, 
the employment service operated on the labor market more 
effectively than in the previous year. The number of nonworking 
citizens placed in jobs by the service increased by 12.8 
percent, the number of those referred for vocational 
training--by 263 percent, and the number of those enlisted in 
public works--by a factor of 30.

<F P=106> [Article by Ayaz Khasanov: "TOTs Intends To Come to Power"] </F>
  [Text] As IZVESTIYA TATARSTANA has reported, the 
cochairmen of the Tatar Social Center [TOTs] held a news 
conference in Kazan on the subject "The Future of the National 
Movement." 
  One of the leaders of the TOTs, Maro Shamsutdinov, 
acquainted 
journalists with the decisions of the last plenum of the social 
center, which openly proclaimed a new objective--coming to 
power. Moreover, it was emphasized: only by constitutional 
means. Up to the present TOTs had not put forth such a slogan, 
and has generally not engaged in the struggle for power. It also 
endeavored to resolve questions of the federalization of Russia. 
In the opinion of the organizers of the news conference there 
has been no real federalism in the Russian Federation, there is 
none, and it seems there will not be any; it has remained a 
unitary state. 
  For this reason, the leaders of the national movement cannot 
concur with the fact of the signing of the treaty between 
Tatarstan and Russia, which preserves the centralized 
distribution of a planned economy. But what is dangerous, TOTs 
members think, is not the treaty, which actually is more of a 
political nature, but intergovernmental agreements that are 
reinforced by the treaty. TOTs cannot agree at all with the 12 
agreements in which the direct implementation of the treaty is 
laid out. And it does not share the position of the Supreme 
Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan, which remains silent when 
the executive organs sign an interstate treaty. Early elections 
to parliament, TOTs representatives think, are simply necessary 
inasmuch as the legislative organ is not coping with its 
functions. 
  In the opinion of the leaders of the national movement, the 
formation of a new personnel policy plays a not unimportant 
role. Up to now this question is being resolved in secrecy. But 
what is needed, first and foremost, is the appointment of heads 
of administration through elections. Otherwise they will remain 
officials with unlimited authority over which there is no 
control. 
  The TOTs leaders intend also to engage in the destatization 
of the mass media, as they are convinced that they are strictly 
subordinated today to the power structures. 
  Regarding the question of a split in the leadership of the 
national movement, Rashat Safin informed journalists of the 
decision of the plenum to declare a moratorium on criticism and 
fighting among themselves. "For the sake of the nation's 
interests, we must be together, especially since our views have 
never differed on the main thing."

<F P=106> [Interview with Ravil Muratov, deputy prime minister of the </F>
Republic of Tatarstan, by INTERFAX correspondent Guzel 
Fazullina, especially for IZVESTIYA TATARSTANA, under the rubric 
"Point of View"; place and date not given: "Ravil Muratov: 
`Assertions About Prosperity in Tatarstan Are Still Far From the 
Truth'"] 
  [Text] Having signed a package of intergovernmental 
agreements with Russia, Tatarstan [lines missing as received] 
according a greater degree of economic freedom. However, even 
during the two years in which negotiations were underway and the 
republic insisted on its "special position, special status," the 
leadership had an opportunity to pursue its own economic policy, 
which could be somewhat different from that of Russia. How fully 
did the government of Tatarstan take advantage of this 
opportunity to conduct reforms? Did it not restrict itself to 
social programs and support for rural areas from the budget, 
failing to provide conditions for transformations in the 
agrarian sector? 
  Ravil Muratov, deputy prime minister of the Republic of 
Tatarstan, answers this and other questions in an interview by 
an INTERFAX correspondent. 
  [Fazullina] The advantages of the policy of a "soft" entry 
into a market economy, which Tatarstan has opted for, are 
obvious. The government has succeeded in somewhat cushioning the 
shock of a cataclysmic price liberalization and halting a drop 
in production in the agrarian sector. However, both the programs 
of targeted social protection and financial infusions for the 
rural areas were effected at the expense of the budget and oil 
exports. The current nonpayment crisis, the tax burden, and a 
decline in world prices for oil call into doubt these 
traditional sources of financing for the republic. What lies 
ahead for the economy of Tatarstan? 
  [Muratov] Unfortunately, the government has actually let go 
of long-term programs while it has focused its attention on 
social programs and supported the rural areas, i.e. it has 
fought to survive in an elementary fashion. Independent exports 
of oil have indeed helped to somewhat contain a complete 
collapse in the economy. However, relative stability is merely a 
launching pad for the beginning of reforms, first of all of the 
financial and tax systems and in the agrarian sector. We were 
among the first to put into circulation bills of exchange that 
were to mitigate the nonpayment crisis and the absence of 
centralized credit resources. However, the extensive use of 
bills of exchange was hampered by banks, primarily the National 
Bank: It is more advantageous for it to deal with ringing cash 
rather than bills of exchange, and to collect a high percentage 
of profits for the Central Bank of Russia. Enterprises did not 
receive bills of exchange well, either. We wasted time and an 
opportunity. Russian banks are introducing bills of exchange 
now; we must say that they are doing far better than we are. 
  We are beginning to plainly fall behind some regions which 
develop their programs. Our enterprises are bogged down in the 
quagmire of nonpayments, but they are persistently clinging to 
the old pattern for settlements. The government has been forced 
to allocate billions from the budget for Nizhnekamskneftekhim 
Joint-Stock Company to pay its debts to Tatneft. However, one 
enterprise carries on the technological sequence of the other. 
It is possible to make arrangements with the oilmen for 
settlements after the finished products of petrochemistry are 
sold! Alas, each of them prefers to be awash in his own debts. 
  The government embarks on quite costly social programs, 
which 
in and of itself is a favorable fact. However, one gets the 
impression that we do not quite care about forming real sources 
of funding for them, primarily the budget. Who is going to pay 
taxes? Enterprises that are indebted to one another? 
Entrepreneurs who are smothered by the tax press to such a 
degree that it is time to wind down production? Kolkhozes and 
sovkhozes that draw subsidies and are unprofitable for the most 
part? 
  We are wasting the time and the opportunity of conducting 
reforms with smaller losses. Our rural areas are still 
unaffected by transformations. The government continues to 
invest billions in the rural areas by supporting unprofitable 
farms, whereas it should implement land reform, introduce 
private ownership of land, as is laid down in the Constitution, 
and transfer it to those who will be able to operate profitably. 
However, here [lines missing as received] owner-operated 
farming. As a result, meat sold by private traders at markets 
costs as much as state meat in the stores. In the future, it is 
going to get still worse. Not billions, but rather trillions, of 
rubles will be needed in the fall when we have to pay for 
finished products. What kind of budget can bear this? We should 
encourage those who want to and are capable of managing 
efficiently rather than support the bankrupt at the expense of 
the taxpayer. 
  [Fazullina] What stood in the way of the government 
developing a program for the support of private business in both 
the rural and urban areas? At present, Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast 
has no more rights and powers than Tatarstan, but it is 
precisely its format of agrarian reform that is being proposed 
as a model. Governor Boris Nemtsov did not seek special powers 
in the conduct of foreign economic operations; nonetheless, the 
West is now prepared to invest capital in the economy of the 
oblast, including the development of small business.... 
  [Muratov] Perhaps it was our conservatism, deliberation, the 
desire to take a close look at Russian reforms and to avoid 
mistakes. However, at the same time we allowed our own mistakes 
to occur by failing to develop a concept of economic 
development. We talked a lot about supporting small- and 
medium-size businesses, having failed to take any practical 
steps at the same time. As early as one year ago, the need was 
obvious to provide conditions and a system of preferences for 
the priority development of the business infrastructure--banks, 
leasing, marketing, and brokerage companies. At present, many 
small- and medium-size banks are on the brink of bankruptcy, 
despite the high rates of interest on credit. Can we count on 
production developing under such circumstances? Can we expect a 
surge of entrepreneurship as we set excessively high taxes? Can 
we count on the prompt emergence of a class of medium-size 
entrepreneurs if in our republic, merchants and businessmen are 
virtually on a par with criminal elements in public 
consciousness? The government is not the only one to contribute 
its share of conservatism. Alas, our parliament is not 
particularly radical either, as it passes a law forbidding the 
managers of enterprises to engage in entrepreneurship or 
proposes to close down commercial stands. And what about the 
primary accumulation of capital? 
  As far as our independence in foreign economic operations is 
concerned, so far it has, unfortunately, existed on paper for 
the most part; we are yet to defend real rights. I will give 
examples. Recently, exclusive rights to transport and export oil 
through the port of Odessa were assigned to the Russian company 
Koneks by a directive of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy of the 
Russian Federation, notwithstanding the fact that agreements 
signed with both Russia and Ukraine provide for the free and 
unhindered movement of freight, including oil, through the 
territories of both countries, and that Tatarstan has the right 
to independently engage in foreign economic activities. They are 
trying to dictate their terms to us nonetheless. 
  Export and import duties are established by the Russian 
Government. What real guarantees of the repatriation of capital 
can we give to foreign investors under the circumstances? 
Moreover, even government programs are being frustrated because 
of an increase in customs duties; we cannot import 
telecommunications equipment. 
  I would not like to paint an excessively gloomy picture, but 
assertions about prosperity in Tatarstan are still far from the 
truth, even if our indicators are somewhat better than those of 
our neighbors. We should not give in to the illusion of a better 
tomorrow if we are virtually standing in place at present. The 
treaty has been signed; the agreements have been concluded. At 
present, it is very important to take full advantage of the 
rights granted to us and to ensure unconditional compliance with 
all agreements.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Yudin, deputy chairman of the </F>
Magadan Oblast Property Fund, by Vladimir Androsenko, RABOCHAYA 
TRIBUNA reporter, Magadan: "The North is Not Rushing to Applaud 
Chubays"] 
  [Text] The Federal Assembly must give territories the right 
to make their own decisions regarding privatization, says 
Vladimir Yudin, deputy chairman of the Magadan Oblast Property 
Fund. A RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA correspondent talks with him. 
  [Yudin] I would like to begin with a comparison. As we know, 
in the Far North nature is extremely fragile. The wounds that it 
suffers take decades to heal. Just as capable of being wounded 
is the north's particular economy, which is based on mining and 
fishing. Production, which is a single technological process, 
reacts to network violations by declining, and this has a severe 
effect on workers. Such ruptures are the result of too hurried 
privatization "according to the Chubays method," which is 
characterized not by economic expediency but by a practice 
well-known to us from the past - that of the company campaign, 
of the most rapid 100-percent seizure. 
  Unfortunately, in many parts of Russia it is too late to 
stop 
and look into matters because everything has been given away. 
But that is not the case here. In Magadan Oblast privatization 
has proceeded slowly until now. The first to be subject to it 
were trade, the consumer sphere, and transportation. The 
foundation, however -- ore concentration combines and the fish 
industry --remained untouched. For us this was a good chance to 
preserve our economic potential. I feel that the oblast duma and 
oblast administration, in developing a privatization plan for 
1994, will be obliged to make corrections that are directed at 
raising its effectiveness. 
  [Androsenko] In your opinions, what should be the 
priorities? 
  [Yudin] First of all, it should be noted that the idea of 
voucher privatization has suffered a crash. Meanwhile, the 
powers that be are forcefully pushing the voucher variant. Why? 
The answer is obvious -- this is advantageous to our nouveau 
riche, to those who have amassed a great deal of money through 
speculation and other criminal activities, who bought up 
vouchers at an inexpensive price, and who, taking advantage of 
corruption, became the overseers of the most profitable 
enterprises. I think that the rejection of voucher privatization 
and the transition to routine privatization using money will be 
more fruitful. 
  The second question -- monopolies and "key" enterprises. Is 
it efficient, let us say, to put the only Nefteprodukt 
[Petroleum product] enterprise in the oblast into private hands 
when it has at its disposal all fuel capacities and fuel lines 
in the territory? Pilots, automobile drivers and villagers are 
now dependent on it, but the possibilities for regulating its 
operations at least in some way have already been lost. 
  Or let us take transportation by motor vehicle. Practically 
all motor-transport depots in the oblast have been privatized 
and control over solutions to general territorial problems has 
been lost. The tragedy of the frozen village of Yagodnyy had a 
great deal to do, I think, with the impossibility of interesting 
private car owners in transporting coal. 
  [Androsenko] Vladimir Dmitriyevich, the first stage has 
practically been completed. What will the consequences be? 
  [Yudin] One of them will be the fragmenting of government 
property into small parts with an inadequate level of management 
and responsibility. In our oblast we have not heard of any 
privatized enterprises that have begun to work more productively 
or dependably. As far as I know the same is true all over Russia. 
  A second important consideration is that the country is 
being 
deprived of a normal labor market. Take a look. A furious 
emphasis is being placed on property owners. Moreover, this is 
done with reference to Western society. Yet this is not true. In 
the West the majority of the population is comprised not of 
owners but of ordinary people who work for someone else and who 
receive a dignified remuneration for their work. As a rule, 
owners there have assets to develop production and pay workers. 
Here the labor collective, having exchanged 51 percent of stock 
for vouchers, must supply and develop production as well as 
supply its own needs, but it does not have the assets to do 
this. Basically, the government is simply freeing itself of the 
responsibility for the fates of millions of people. I do not 
believe that this is right and I think it will have a 
considerable negative impact on reform. 
  Our stockholders often do not even understand the real cost 
of fixed AO [joint-stock company] capital, of investments and 
degree of dependability. They are bewitched by the round figures 
of promised dividends and no one cares about anything else. 
  [Androsenko] Yes, television pictures of Muscovites storming 
the offices of Olbk when stock was issued seemed symptomatic to 
me. Such things do not occur here. Is it that northerners are 
more prone to analysis or is it simply hard to get them moving? 
  [Yudin] The main thing here is that northerners were first 
among Russians to face the uncertainty of tomorrow. In the Far 
North we can see with special clarity the gap between the pretty 
stories of radical reformers and the actual situation. Here 
geology, building and agriculture have been almost completely 
destroyed, gold extraction is on the decline and mining towns 
are closing. Under such conditions it is difficult to expect 
people to invest assets in enterprises that can become bankrupt 
at any time. 
  There have been a few things that have put us on the alert. 
The Russian Privatization Program for 1994 was passed without 
the participation of representatives and without summarizing 
1993 results. Judging by A. Chubays' statements, such an 
analysis would be undesirable for him, and it is understandable 
that he would attempt to keep it from a vote. 
  Meanwhile, the privatization process is acquiring more of an 
administrative and command nature. It is strange that the 
directives of the former Gosplan [State Planning Committee] are 
considered bad while those of Goskomimushchestvo [State Property 
Committee] are looked upon as good. And it is not important that 
the word "directive" somehow does not correspond to A. Chubays' 
favorite word -- "market." For example, despite the order from 
above, for over a year now we have been unable to sell all of 
the stock of Khasynskiy Building Materials Plant -- the 
population will not buy it. On the other hand, the hurried 
fulfillment of last year's presidential decree on selling motor 
vehicle enterprises by 1 August, in my opinion had a negative 
effect on the situation in the oblast. In other words, a clear 
transition from one administrative system to another, and one 
that is even more severe, is evident. 
  We feel it is essential that the Federal Assembly make a 
decision that will give territories the right to deal with basic 
questions involving privatization. Undoubtedly, it is necessary 
to privatize enterprises and to place them into private hands, 
but not in the way that Chubays demands, wholesale, and by the 
end of the first six months of the year without fail. We wish to 
implement matters openly, without fuss, and to the greatest 
advantage for the working man, the new owner and the government.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Semenov, personal correspondent </F>
(Yaroslavl): "Tea Party in the `Golden Bear,' or Why Organized 
Crime Calls Yaroslavl a `Sweet City'"] 
  [Text] My friends advised me right away to forget the 
whole thing, but I kept remembering a statement by Lt. Col. Kh. 
Alyautdinov: "I find myself wondering why and for whom we are 
doing all of this. Whom are we protecting? I have the sense that 
no one wants this." I understood not only what he said, but also 
what he chose not to say. That is why I went to the most 
exclusive and ominous bar in Yaroslavl--the "Golden Bear." 
  The building, which is located in an neglected park, has no 
external appeal whatsoever. In fact, it looks like a painted 
shed, but as soon as I walked up to the door, it opened and a 
young man with an athletic build asked politely from inside: 
"May I help you?" After hearing that I wanted to see the 
director, he stepped aside and courteously helped me remove my 
coat. I entered a luxurious room, tastefully decorated with 
modern furniture and the finest china and glassware, and 
also...with soft and soothing music playing in the background. 
An attractive long-legged waitress brought me a cup of coffee, 
an orange, a glass of water, and...a check for 3,540 rubles. 
  According to reports received by the organized 
crime-fighting 
division of the Yaroslavl Oblast Internal Affairs 
Administration, the main black marketeers and criminal 
"authorities" were supposed to meet here for a "convention." 
They were supposed to agree on the division of economic spheres 
of influence and reach a consensus on certain areas of 
controversy. The Moscow bosses and representatives of the 
Georgian and Chechen Mafia were expected as guests. This 
interregional meeting was viewed by the Yaroslavl police as an 
exceptionally disturbing event. After all, the experience of 
other cities, not to mention Yaroslavl itself, indicated that 
"conferences" of this kind frequently culminated in bloody 
confrontations. 
  The Yaroslavl Organized Crime-Fighting Division began 
planning an operation to cut the "convention" short and arrest 
the guests of the exclusive bar. The rapid-response team which 
had been created specifically for the apprehension of armed 
criminals in emergency situations would be part of the 
operation. The detectives knew the time and place of the gang 
leaders' meeting, and they were even "accompanying" the bosses 
all the way from Moscow. The crime world had responded quickly 
to the creation of the new subdivision fighting organized crime 
and had established a reliable system of defense against the 
infiltration of their top ranks by MVD personnel. 
  At around 1600 hours the guests began arriving at the family 
tavern of Ye. Karpova. They ordered tea at first, and then cold 
appetizers and meat. The family dinner began. By that time the 
personnel of the special subdivision had entered the kitchen and 
had dashed from there into the main dining room. Within 30 or 40 
seconds they were leading the visitors out of the bar and asking 
for their identification papers, filming the whole operation 
with a video camera. It was a motley crew: former Komsomol 
personnel, prominent athletes, and novice businessmen. In all, 
32 people were detained, including 10 "chiefs" from Moscow, 12 
residents of Chechnya, and 10 representatives of Yaroslavl 
commercial groups and their companions. 
  Unfortunately, the success of the raid was minimal. Because 
no one was armed (although there was a weapon in an old 
Zaporozhets parked near the bar, according to some reports), no 
one could be charged with a crime, and the police had to release 
all of the "innocent diners." I think they did this grudgingly. 
After all, they know all about the present activities and the 
criminal past of many of the people who were detained. Just four 
of them had spent a total of a quarter of a century behind bars. 
  Knowing this, however, is not the same as being able to take 
action within the law. Organized crime is a complex structure 
today, enveloping our whole society like a cobweb. Furthermore, 
its social base is growing broader. By constantly augmenting its 
covert economic relations, it has already turned into a threat 
to the system of public administration. The organization of the 
old crime world, which was based on concealment from society, is 
undergoing rapid renovation. The strong will of the leaders of 
organized crime is combined with intelligence, and they are 
excellent organizers, psychologists, and economists. 
Furthermore, the people behind them are absolutely respectable 
gentlemen who are almost above suspicion. 
  That is the reason for the minimal results, and sometimes 
even the outright failures, that provide the grounds for the 
contradictory evaluations of police performance. The events in 
the "Golden Bear" demonstrate all of the complexity and depth of 
the criminals' social mimicry. "Golden Bear" proprietress Ye. 
Karpova, for instance, is an expert at impersonating a victim. 
  "This bar belongs to my private firm `Katerina,'" she 
explained. "Our clients have always been respectable. We never 
let suspicious people in. Yes, our bar is frequented by local 
`authorities,' and we know them, but can you name a bar they do 
not frequent?..." 
  Of course, the proprietress of the "Golden Bear" immediately 
filed a complaint with the procuracy, accusing the police of 
beating her daughter, Yu. Pautova, who was working in the 
kitchen at that time. The Kirovskiy Rayon Procuracy charged the 
police with exceeding their authority. Deputy Chief Kh. 
Alyautdinov of the Organized Crime-Fighting Division publicly 
acknowledged that "the operation might have been conducted with 
more finesse, but our boys in the special subdivision do not 
have that much experience. All of the cafe owners' complaints 
about their behavior were investigated by the heads of the 
Internal Affairs Administration and the Procuracy in the manner 
prescribed by law." 
  There is good reason for the special interest in the 
exclusive bar. The owners serve a select clientele. One day they 
even turned away the deputy chief of the crime-fighting 
division, who had come there with his family, because he was not 
one of their regular patrons. Furthermore, this is not the first 
time the bar has been under investigation. How could an 
establishment with only around 10 patrons a night be so 
successful? High prices? Yes! But how high would they have to be 
to cover expenses and provide a profit? That is what made 
certain agencies suspicious.... 
  The "Golden Bear" is closely associated with a firm in the 
motion picture business. Was it a coincidence that the deputy 
director of the firm was at the bar on the date of the 
"convention" and was one of the men detained by the special 
subdivision? Besides this, bar director Ye. Karpova was a good 
friend of Mudryashov, the municipal administrator who was killed 
not long ago. He was not the only one who was killed at that 
time, during the struggle for spheres of influence and power. 
Now the people in charge are his friends and associates, and 
perhaps his conquerors, but it was Mudryashov who guaranteed the 
safety of the "Golden Bear." 
  "It was because of him that no one bothered us," Ye. Karpova 
admitted. "He told everyone that we were his friends. That was a 
long time ago, and no one has bothered us up to now...." 
  I think the proprietors of trade and food service 
establishments are well aware of the price of this protection. 
Literally all of them are expected to pay outrageous fees for 
it. Furthermore, it was apparently no coincidence that the 
interregional meeting of the "influential" men was held in the 
"Golden Bear." Incidentally, according to reports received by 
the organized crime-fighting division, the decision to give one 
of the Yaroslavl "authorities" the control of the purchase and 
sale of weapons was made at that "conference." One of the guests 
at the "family dinner" was killed in Moscow soon afterward. 
Another appeared on the central television network and announced 
his intention to form a new party. In this way, the 
consolidation of economic influence is being accompanied by the 
gradual politicizing of the crime world, reflecting its leaders' 
plans to use their capital to create more favorable conditions 
for their activities. The friendly gathering in the bar is 
already having far-reaching consequences. 
  Yaroslavl's proximity to Moscow has made it an appealing 
location for the investment of criminal capital in privatized 
state property, the sale of real estate, and involvement in 
trade and financial affairs. The money is usually invested in 
spheres with a quick turnover, where there are no production 
stages guaranteeing superprofits. The reason is simple: 
Businesses with a quick turnover of capital are difficult to 
monitor. 
  Is this why Yaroslavl is called the "sweet city"? The 
organized crime-fighting division assured me that they have the 
situation in the city under control and cited some reassuring 
statistics. Last year division personnel solved 227 crimes, 76 
of which were committed by organized crime gangs, including 24 
with implications of corruption. The criminals had managed to 
launder more than a billion rubles with the aid of fraudulent 
bank documents. A large criminal gang had been discovered in the 
oil business. 
  All of this is impressive, but reports received by the same 
division indicate the rapid growth and merger of criminal gangs 
in Yaroslavl. Private security firms with criminal connections 
are springing up like mushrooms. Trade establishments with 
respectable names are using coercive methods at privatization 
auctions to buy state property and real estate at low prices. 
The motor transport base with a large sports complex here, for 
example, was sold for only 60 million. According to a reliable 
source, a noodle shop with imported equipment was privatized for 
47 million rubles. 
  Some commercial structures that were established as part of 
state enterprises are also closely related to criminal 
businesses. There are some companies with colossal assets in 
Yaroslavl that are still in the shadows. Some own hotels or 
gambling and trade establishments, but who is behind all of 
this? The common opinion is that criminal communities cannot 
exist without the help of corrupt officials, who cover their 
tracks in exchange for a share of their income. 
  The events at the "Golden Bear" aroused some interest and 
were then immediately forgotten. Only Kh. Alyautdinov took the 
failure to heart. Every cloud, however, has a silver lining. 
This might contribute to the realization that traditional police 
methods of fighting organized crime cannot produce the desired 
results. Running around in kitchens in bullet-proof vests and 
masks and waving assault rifles cannot be effective in fighting 
the forces that are now a visible segment of the Russian 
society. This will take other methods and other skills. We still 
have to learn them. From whom? From life, of course.

the form of a poll, however, which is not legally binding. Those

<F P=106> [Article by Ye. Dolgopyatova: "Women and Workers Were Not </F>
Elected"] 
  [Text] Yesterday the city electoral commission held a news 
conference in Mariynskiy Palace and made public the preliminary 
results of the second round of elections to the St. Petersburg 
City Assembly. 
  Only 18.76 percent of the overall number of registered 
voters 
participated in the voting. Elections were held in 24 electoral 
precincts. The social composition of the deputies is curious: 
eight were managers, five--teachers, four--businessmen, 
three--scientific associates, three--representatives of public 
organizations, and one--an office employee. Not a single worker 
was among the candidates who were elected. Among the deputies 
there is not a single representative of the fair sex--all five 
women who entered the second round suffered defeat by their male 
competitors. 
  The deputy chairman of the city electoral commission, R.G. 
Malova, noted that the situation was calmer in the second round 
of the elections. There were no serious complaints or 
grievances. In Rita Grigoryevna's opinion, the voters made their 
choice, which was significantly different from the results of 
the first round, on the basis of television and radio debates, 
which helped the Petersburgers to get to know the candidates 
directly. 
  According to observations of the state electoral commission, 
it was mostly the older generation who voted and there were 
practically no youth at the precincts except a certain number of 
students and military servicemen. 
  A very strange situation developed in the 39th electoral 
district of Oktyabrskiy Rayon. As we know, the state electoral 
commission kept an eye out for violations when the results of 
the first round of voting were being summed up. According to 
information from the chairman of the city electoral commission, 
V.I. Fomichev, only 20,030 people voted here during 20-21 March, 
while there are 80,875 voters registered in Oktyabrskiy Rayon. 
Thus the necessary 25 percent did not participate in the first 
round of voting. On these grounds the city electoral commission 
declared the first round of elections in the 39th district to be 
null and void. But the city's mayor, A.A. Sobchak, subsequently 
overrode the decision of the city commission, and on 3 April 
there was a repeat vote in this district as well. But the city 
electoral commission did not intend to take these results into 
account. 
  V.I. Fomichev thinks that the city acted in keeping with the 
Statute on Elections to the City Assembly within the limits of 
its authority and that no official has the right to override its 
decision. This can be done only though the courts. 
  Thus another has been added to the many points of confusion 
regarding the past elections.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktoriya Rabotnova: "Shall We Begin at the </F>
Beginning?"] 
  [Text] The Council of Electoral Associations has confirmed 
its statement of 21 March, which discusses the illegality of the 
spring elections to the City Assembly. The council continues to 
insist on conducting in 1994 truly democratic elections to the 
deputy corps, combining the voting with a poll of the population 
concerning confidence in the mayor of St. Petersburg. 
  It is worth noting that the petition was signed not only by 
those who lost but also by the "City We Love" movement, whose 
candidates won in five districts, and also the "Our City--Our 
Home" and "Unity for Progress" movements, which also achieved a 
certain amount of success. As we know, Aleksandr Shelkanov has 
not changed his opinion about the illegality of the elections. 
But the representatives of "Democratic Unity," "Business St. 
Petersburg," and "All St. Petersburg" still hold the opposite 
viewpoint. 
  Incidentally, the leaders of "Democratic Unity" are now in 
Moscow--the question of the elections in our city is expected to 
be discussed at today's session of the State Duma.

AGENCY: "St. Petersburg Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
Is Created"] 
  [Text] The St. Petersburg Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development [SPBRD] held its founding meeting yesterday in 
Smolnyy. The new bank, in the form of a publicly-held 
joint-stock society, was founded by the Committee for the 
Administration of City Property [CACP], the Population 
Employment Fund, the largest insurance funds, and state 
enterprises. 
  The decision to create the SPBRD was made by the city 
mayoralty, with the support of the Central Bank of Russia 
Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko. The bank is to become the city 
administration's agent in working with large investments, as a 
partner of the World Bank and the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development. 
  The meeting appointed a bank supervisors' council headed by 
Anatoliy Sobchak; among its members are deputy mayors Vladimir 
Putin, Vladimir Yakovlev, Mikhail Manevich, and Vitaliy Mutko. 
Deputy chairman of the St. Petersburg government, Aleksey 
Kudrin, was elected chairman of the board of directors, and 
Dmitriy Pankin, his deputy in the economics and finance 
committee, the chairman of the board of trustees. 
  The bank's charter capital is set at 6,923,050,000 rubles. 
The city, represented by CACP, will own 35 percent of the stock. 
The SPBRD's headquarters will be located at 78 Moyka Embankment, 
and its branches and administrations, at 14 Izmaylovo Avenue and 
8 Moscow Avenue.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Grachev, editor of the social policy and </F>
letters department: "Sociologists Maintain That Our Main Concern 
Is Crime"] 
  [Text] Today, with the help of the Ecro Company, we will 
tell what St. Petersburg residents think of the work of the 
bodies of executive authority--the Russian Government and the 
St. Petersburg mayoralty. The figures (all are given as 
percents) tell us that we are becoming increasingly critical of 
the institutes of authority in general and executive authority 
in particular. In this respect, it would be instructive to 
compare the results of previous sociological surveys published 
in SANKT PETERSBURGSKIYE VEDOMOSTI with the results tabulated by 
the Ecro Company. Well, while in February 1993 only 38 percent 
of city residents did not believe that the authorities would be 
able to pull the country out of the crisis, in August 1993 this 
figure had already increased to 43 percent. Today, however, to 
the question "Do you believe that the existing executive 
authority in Russia is capable of pulling the country out of the 
crisis?" only 17 percent answered affirmatively, while 63 
percent answered unequivocally negatively. 
  Our compatriots are somewhat more charitable of the 
mayoralty 
actions. "Negative" was the reply of 35 percent and "somewhat 
negative"--of 19 percent. There are, however, also fewer 
unequivocally positive replies--6 percent. 
  What does it all tell us? First and foremost, that the 
negative trends that manifest themselves sharply around the 
country, most often are contained in our city, thereby ensuring 
a relative social stability. 
  At the same time, another research recently commissioned by 
the newspaper points at those spheres of the city life which 
increasingly often cause our dissatisfaction today and by which 
the people judge the mayoralty's work. The wording of the 
question was: "What are the problems the city authorities should 
pay the greatest attention to?" The response shows that the 
problem of combating crime by far leads the list--78 percent. 
The second is social security--43.5 percent, and the third, 
health care--43.3 percent; they are followed by transportation 
problems--31.7 percent, unemployment--26.5 percent, availability 
of housing--26 percent, supply of goods--25.3 percent, and 
education--18.4 percent. (Each respondent could select no more 
than three problems that are most important for him. Therefore 
the total exceeds 100 percent.) 
  It is quite obvious that confidence in local authorities is 
determined to a great extent by how well it takes into account 
concerns and wishes of ordinary city residents. And they name 
first, let us repeat, suppression of crime and personal safety, 
social security, and operation of health care facilities and 
transportation.

<F P=106> ["Selective rendition" of Moscow Committee on Environmental </F>
Protection and Natural Resources report, by Ye. Subbotina: 
"Moskompriroda Is Watching Attentively"] 
  [Text] Moskompriroda [Moscow Committee on 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources] specialists have 
prepared a review of the environmental protection activities of 
enterprises and other facilities. The review was compiled from 
the results of state oversight activities in 1993. MOSKOVSKAYA 
PRAVDA found it expedient to publish a selective rendition of 
this work. Of course, many facts registered by Moskompriroda are 
alarming and a cause for health concerns. All of us would rather 
see a smog-free capital city; the reality today, however, is 
that Moscow is an industrial giant saturated to capacity with 
industrial and automotive transportation enterprises, warehouse 
zones, and transportation arteries. There are 62 large 
industrial zones on city territory inside the beltway. 
Automobiles are the main contributors to environmental 
pollution. The number of cars in Moscow is growing annually; 
200,000 cars were added in 1993. As of 1 January last year there 
were more than 1 million cars in the city. The increasing number 
of cars is a direct route to increased discharge of harmful 
substances into the atmosphere. 
  The finding of Moskompriroda specialists is that 
environmental pollution in Moscow remains high. 
<H5>  What We Breath </H5>
  In 1993 the Moscow State Inspection for Protection of the 
Atmosphere conducted 1,120 checks at industrial and automotive 
transportation enterprises in the city. It uncovered 10,166 
violations. Industry and power generation discharged 230,718 
tonnes of pollutants. Of this discharge, 90 percent comprise 
solid substances and nitrogen, carbons, and hydrocarbon oxides. 
Analysis of the state of atmospheric air shows that the higher 
than average level of pollution is created by discharges of 
nitrogen, ammonia, benzene, phenol, and hydrocarbon dioxides. 
  Motor vehicles are serious air polluters. Moskompriroda 
conducted inspections of automotive transportation enterprises; 
twice--in May and September--it conducted Operation Clean Air. 
It inspected 520 enterprises, including the AMO ZIL [Imeni 
Lenina Auto Works] and AZLK plant [Imeni Leninskogo Komsomola 
Auto Works]. It registered 856 violations. Thousands of cars 
were checked by instruments, and one out of five did not meet 
standards. 
  More than 71,000 cars were checked for exhaust toxicity in 
the course of Operation Clean Air. The number of cars that did 
not meet state standards amounted to 14.7 percent. This is 
unquestionably a large number, although we can console ourselves 
with the fact that in 1992 the same indicator measured 17.7 
percent. To a large extent the reduction has been achieved as a 
result of automotive enterprises beginning to actively equip 
themselves with gas analysis apparatus. 
  The total discharge of pollutants into the atmosphere in 
1993 
(industry and automotive transport) amounted to more than 1 
million tonnes. 
  A special issue are foundries within city limits. On 1 
February 1990, a decision was adopted on 56 priority steps aimed 
at reducing the discharge of hazardous substances from foundries 
at the city's 53 enterprises. As of 1 January of this year, 53 
points of the program have been implemented; it includes 
reconstruction and liquidation of foundries, construction of gas 
scrubbers, and reduction of the production volume by reducing 
deliveries to other regions. Two points have not been 
implemented: the metal household goods plant No. 6 has not been 
shut down (Southwestern district) and the foundry of the 
Stekloagregat plant (Southern district) has not undergone 
reconstruction. By now foundry discharges into the atmosphere 
have been cut by 9,924 tonnes, which is 83 percent of that 
envisaged in the full program. 
<H5>  The Water We Drink </H5>
  In 1993 the Moscow City Inspection for the Protection of 
Water Resources conducted 1,029 checks at 947 facilities. Among 
them are 456 industrial and automotive transportation 
enterprises, Mosvodokanal, and Mosvodostok. 
  It was established that the city's aeration stations, which 
dump insufficiently purified waste into the Moscow River, and 
dumping from construction sites and residential areas remain the 
main sources of pollution of Moscow reservoirs. Moskompriroda 
inspectors uncovered 396 violations of water protection 
legislation. The violators were fined a total of 18,935 million 
rubles [R]. 
  The inspectors found that of 252 operating industrial waste 
purification systems, almost half (!) were ineffective or out of 
order. In 1992, 60 percent of systems were noted as out of 
order. Overall, the situation remains unsatisfactory. 
  It is good to see that 84 of the total number of inspected 
enterprises have 149 circulating water cycle system functioning, 
and 19 enterprises have 24 systems using recycled water. 
  Among the violators of water protection legislation were the 
NPO [scientific-industrial association] Kauchuk, the First Watch 
Factory, the AP [joint-stock enterprise[ Meridian, the oil and 
lubricant plant, the Dynamo plant, the Danilovo cab 
manufacturing plant, and others. 
  Overall there has been a reduction in the discharge of 
metals, petroleum products, and suspended particles, which is a 
result of cutbacks in production as well as of 
water-purification systems being installed at industrial 
facilities. 
  Analysis of aeration stations' operations for past year 
leads 
to the following conclusions: The Kuryanov, Lyubertsy, and 
Zelenograd stations and the Lyublino shop for comprehensive 
water purification dump liquid waste that does not meet standard 
requirements, which pollutes rivers. The reasons for 
unsatisfactory operations of the stations is delay in bringing 
on line reserve capacities and overload of currently operating 
capacities. 
  A serious strain on the environment comes from Galvanic 
production, which essentially dumps heavy metal salts. The 
Government of Moscow's program, which envisages liquidation and 
reconstruction of galvanic production, is being implemented too 
slowly. 
  More dirt is brought by snow, which is dumped into the 
Moscow 
River--snow carries into the water petroleum products, 
chlorides, and suspended particles. 
  The city's main river is still not in good health. The 
segments of the Moscow River within the city limits that are in 
the worst shape are still the sites where waste water is being 
dumped from city aeration stations. In 1993, 11 tributaries of 
the Moscow River were checked. The negative effect of 10 of them 
is negligible; only Yauza has a perceptible role in pollution of 
the Moscow River. 
  The most polluted rivers are Yauza, Filka, Presnya, and 
Kotlovka, where specific pollution is detected: petroleum 
products--from 3 to 94 (!) MAL [maximum allowable level]; and 
heavy metal salts, especially copper, iron, and zinc--up to 37 
MAL. 
<H5>  The Soil We Walk On </H5>
  As of 1 January 1994 there were 102 unauthorized dump sites 
in Moscow with a total area of 280 hectares and consisting 
mostly of solid household and industrial waste and construction 
trash. The largest dump sites are located at Verkhniye Polya 
Street (30 hectares), Brateyevo (15 hectares), and Anreyevskiy 
Ravine (10 hectares). Over the past year 17 dump sites with a 
total area of 17 hectares have been removed. 
  Moskompriroda has registered a multitude of violations with 
respect to land use: unauthorized seizure of land; unauthorized 
construction; failure to fulfill obligations to conduct an 
environmental impact study; violations of environmental 
requirements in storing industrial and household waste. 
  The legality of construction of 63 parking lots and garages 
was checked. The greatest number of violations were registered 
in the Southwestern (12), Southern (9), and Northeastern (5) 
districts. The action with respect to violations included 60 
removal orders, 25 decrees on suspension of work, and 101 
protocols on initiation of administrative court proceedings in 
an amount of R18 million. 
  Over the past year measures of economic coercion in an 
amount 
of R134 million were taken against violators of environmental 
protection legislation. Damage compensation fines amounted to 
R120 million.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Zamyatin: "Visit of U.S. Secretary of </F>
Commerce: Ministers Do Not Come to Russia Now Without 
Businessmen"] 
  [Text] It is not known which there is more 
of--politicians or businessmen--in the delegation of U.S. 
Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown (he is cochairman of the 
Russian-American Committee for Business Cooperation) that began 
its visit to Moscow yesterday. The managers of 28 very big U.S. 
companies arrived together with him. 
  On the list of Brown's audiences were several ministries 
(the 
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, Ministry of Fuel and 
Energy, Ministry of Economics, and Ministry of Finance), Yuriy 
Petrov, the head of the Russian Investment Company, and the 
prime minister himself, Viktor Chernomyrdin. Along with the 
general situation in Russia, specific questions were also 
discussed--the participation of American firms in projects to 
develop the Sakhalin shelf, investments in Russia, and access 
for its commodities to U.S. markets. The secretary of commerce 
used the occasion to express concern over the increase in import 
tariffs in Russia. He reported that he does not share the 
opinion that is current here, particularly in the Ministry of 
Economics, that protectionism will attract investments (the 
argument of the Ministry of Economics is that in order to 
overcome the barrier to imports, foreigners will create 
production in Russia). 
  Brown's mission, obviously, is to dot the "i's" with respect 
to other problems--the fate of the most expensive IBM project in 
Russia (at a cost of $130 million), which is being financed by 
the EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development] ($40 
million), and the U.S. Export-Import Bank ($90 million). There 
is the question of replacing the long obsolete Sirena-2 computer 
system used in the sale of air tickets. Not long ago a 
competitor appeared for the IBM project: The Department of Air 
Transport of Russia has proposed phased modernization of 
Sirena-2 for a total of $40 million. However, this plan, other 
than its relative cheapness, is also different in that it is 
based on a sharp reduction in the volume of air traffic and 
threatens to turn into "patching up holes" (if it has a 
temporary character). Brown will try to convince Moscow that the 
popular idea of "supporting domestic producers" is not always 
justified from the standpoint of long-range interests. 
  The secretary of commerce regards discussion of various 
forms 
of assistance to the development of small and medium-sized 
business in Russia as one of the leading themes of his 
negotiations in Moscow. As Ron Brown likes to say, the strength 
and power of the United States have always increased precisely 
owing to the "increase and expansion of small and medium-sized 
firms." Obviously, it is exactly in this connection that he 
planned a visit not only to the Russian capital: Questions of 
increasing the effectiveness of American assistance programs to 
the private sector will be a subject of discussion in St. 
Petersburg and Yekaterinburg. In addition, in the opinion of the 
secretary expressed in an interview just before departing for 
Moscow, the aid given should be oriented on intensifying the 
export potential of the private sector. But, in the opinion of 
the U.S. secretary of commerce, it is also called on to be the 
main object for American export to Russia. Washington is 
pursuing quite reasonable economic interests: An increase in the 
volume of exports of $1 billion will lead to an increase in the 
number of jobs in the United States by 20,000. 
  Moreover, the American administration does not conceal the 
fact that it is still early to view trade and business with 
Russia separately from politics. For, as he figuratively 
expressed it at yesterday's negotiations, "stability and 
predictability are the sisters of investment."

<F P=106> [Article by Larisa Ilyina, DELOVOY MIR correspondent: "A </F>
Business Meeting, but Without Russian Businessmen"] 
  [Text] The interest of American capital in the Russian 
market can be felt just as clearly as, let us say, the thrust of 
a tidal wave on the parapet of a quay. Half of the presidential 
mission of U.S. business circles headed by Secretary of Commerce 
Ron Brown that is now in Russia is made up of the managers of 
leading American companies, among which are such giants as 
Occidental Petroleum, Rockwell International, AT&amp;T, and 
others. 
And, apparently, it is not accidental that almost all the 
questions raised by the guests during a roundtable meeting with 
Russian ministers were concentrated on one problem: guarantees 
for foreign investments in Russia. 
  In responding to these questions, Deputy Prime Minister 
Aleksandr Shokhin reported that the parliamentary committee on 
economic policy was now developing a new variant of a law on 
foreign investments. He expressed the firm conviction that a 
bilateral Russian-American agreement on protection of 
investments will be ratified. 
  The range of questions discussed at a meeting Wednesday of 
the interdepartmental committee on the development of economic 
cooperation was very wide: power engineering, trade, 
investments, U.S. technical and financial assistance provided 
along the line of the Agency for International Development, the 
Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), and programs in 
the sphere of agriculture. Objects of special attention were 
such critical problems as Russian tariff and nontariff trade 
barriers, delays with payments, etc. A special working group was 
established that will examine questions of access to each 
other's markets. 
  A memorandum of mutual agreement of the Government of the 
Russian Federation and the Government of the United States was 
signed on the establishment of American business centers in 
Russia, [a memorandum on] the scope of the jurisdiction of the 
intergovernmental committee on the development of business 
cooperation, and also joint statements of the cochairmen of the 
Russian-American Committee--O. Davydov and Ron Brown--on the 
question of access to Russian and U.S. markets and improving 
conditions of cooperation in the sphere of the medical industry. 
  The American secretary, well-known as "a builder of bridges" 
between our two countries, noted more than once that one of the 
purposes of the visit of such a representative delegation (it is 
made up of more than 100 persons) is "to listen to the voice of 
private entrepreneurs and to give American and Russian 
businesses an opportunity to start direct contacts." However, 
our observer did not find one representative of domestic private 
and joint-stock business at even one of the meetings. Even in 
the council on the development of entrepreneurship under the 
Government of the Russian Federation they replied to a question 
on contacts with the American delegation that they...are hearing 
this for the first time. Well, perhaps they will make up for the 
omission--if not in Moscow then in Yekaterinburg or St. 
Petersburg, where the American presidential delegation was 
continuing its trip.

<F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Sukhova: "Visit of the U.S. Secretary </F>
of Commerce: There Are Four Disasters in Russia: Roads, Fools, 
Taxes, and Tariffs"] 
  [Text] Yesterday Boris Yeltsin received U.S. 
Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, who has come to Russia for a 
week. The president's press service, as always, was niggardly 
with its words: Yeltsin, they said, expressed interest in "an 
expansion of mutually beneficial ties in all spheres of trade." 
In addition, he assured his interlocutor that the American mass 
media are incorrect in discussing a certain cooling in 
Russian-U.S. relations. Although the situation is still far from 
salutary. 
  After Brown's arrival in Moscow, the parties, exchanging 
white-toothed smiles, switched to claims. To the number of major 
Russian disasters, besides the roads and fools noted by Gogol, 
two more, in the opinion of the Americans, should be added: 
Russian taxes and import tariffs. As KOMMERSANT-DAILY 
correspondents learned from sources in the U.S. delegation of 
businessmen accompanying Brown, many of them consider 1994 to be 
a pivotal year: Either there will be a turning point in Russian 
tax and tariff legislation or they will curtail their activity 
here. But if the problems are resolved, U.S. experts predict a 
level of American investments in 1995 on the order of $10 
billion. Ron Brown also joined the Russian chorus of opponents 
of protectionism. Yeltsin also expressed himself in this regard 
the other day, and Chernomyrdin declared that a number of 
tariffs will be revised. It will really be necessary to hurry 
with this: At the "Group of 7" summit in Naples in the summer, 
Russia intends to raise the question of opening the markets of 
the West to its products, and here reciprocity is necessary. The 
first step has been taken in this direction in relations with 
the United States: A statement on mutual access to markets was 
signed yesterday at a meeting of the committee on business 
cooperation. If the memorandum on establishing business centers 
in Russia (talk about them has been going on a long time) and 
the statement on cooperation in the sphere of medicine are not 
taken into account, Brown's visit was not abundant in documents. 
  Of the major practical achievements, mention should be made 
of continuation of work in expert groups on plans for the 
development of the Sakhalin shelf (Sakhalin-1) and the joint 
exploitation with TEXACO of the Timano-Pechora (Komi) oil and 
gas region: Work will begin in the summer. Today, Brown is 
departing for St. Petersburg. On 5 April, KOMMERSANT-DAILY will 
return to the elucidation of his visit.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Brown Persuades His Countrymen on </F>
the Urals and Siberia. American Business Continues To Explore 
the Russian Market"] 
  [Text] "We want to begin a new era of cooperation between 
the United States and Russia based on growing possibilities for 
trade and investment," as U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown 
defined the goal of his visit to Moscow. And although it is 
still early to speak about the approach of a new era, Brown's 
mission can mobilize business connections of the two countries 
which are lagging much behind the level of their political 
dialog. 
  The American delegation included representatives from such 
world-renowned companies and corporations as Motorola, 
Occidental Petroleum, Litton Industries, Oil Capital Limited, 
Macdermott International and Allen And Associations 
International. In the opinion of the Clinton administration, 
the flow of investments into the fuel-energy complex, space 
science, the creation of telecommunications systems and the 
production of medicines will allow the Russian to see more 
graphically the fruits of reform and to accelerate their 
implementation. 
  One of the tasks of Brown's trip, which is being called the 
economic continuation of Bill Clinton's and Boris Yeltsin's 
Moscow meeting, is to urge American investors to enter Russia 
more boldly. The level of American investments in Russia today 
comprises one billion dollars [$] out of a total volume of 
American investments of $490 billion. By comparison, Americans 
invested $239 billion in Europe, $68 billion in Canada, $26 
billion in Japan and $13 billion in Mexico. 
  Testing the soil for possible investments in Russia, Brown's 
team visited the Urals, the region where 80 percent of the 
largest defense industries are concentrated. Of these already 
250 have undergone conversion. The great possibilities of the 
Ural region and its well know independent economic policy 
attracted the Americans. It is no accident that in recent years 
more and more foreign investments are pouring into the region 
and that Western businesses are more often looking at it, justly 
evaluating it as a prospective trade partner. 
  During the course of Brown's visit a number of agreements 
were signed, one of which provides for opening American business 
centers in a number of Russian cities, mainly in the Urals and 
Siberia. These centers will not only help American firms 
arrange business matters in a specific region, but will also aid 
in the development of Russian firms which wish to cooperate with 
American colleagues. 
  In addition, along with Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin, the 
head of the U.S. Department of Commerce signed a statement which 
views the main task as opening up access to the markets of both 
countries. 
  While ongoing plans for Russian-American economic 
cooperation 
were being further worked out in Moscow, the end of COCOM was 
officially registered in The Hague. However, as U.S. State 
Department representative Michael [McCarey] stated, until a new 
system of export control is created Washington will continue to 
maintain a strict licensing plicy regarding trade in goods based 
on high technology. Therefore it is no accident that in the 
bilateral trade relations between Russia and America the 
emphasis is on consumer goods. However, the list of prospective 
products delivered to Russian from the U.S., which was drawn up 
by the American side, includes machinery and equipment for the 
oil and gas industry, fertilizers, equipment for the food 
industry, medicines and medical preparations, medical equipment, 
computers and many other items. 
  At the same time, the Russian market will not see American 
high-tech products except for telecommunications. Therefore 
Brown's mission has special significance. It would like to 
prove that this is the first swallow [bird] of large-scale 
Russian-American economic cooperation and not a smoke screen 
intended to hide existing problems and contradictions in 
bilateral cooperation. 
  The 52-year old Ronald Brown is a lawyer by education 
and has the reputation of being "a strong and independent 
advocate of American business interests. He arrived in Moscow 
with his "team" of 29 large industrialists representing four 
sectors: oil and gas, aeronautics, telecommunications and 
pharmaceuticals.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Petrovskiy, first deputy UN </F>
secretary general, by Irina Denisova: "I Devote My Free Time to 
Work"] 
  [Text] As is often the case with our compatriots 
working abroad, more is more often known and written about them 
"over there" than at home. Vladimir Petrovskiy is no exception. 
The rank of first deputy UN secretary general and leader of this 
organization's European headquarters has secured for him 
extensive celebrity in the diplomatic world. In Russia, on the 
other hand, Vladimir Fedorovich is "known by sight" only by his 
foreign policy department colleagues, in the main. OBSHCHAYA 
GAZETA's interview with Vladimir Petrovskiy is an attempt to 
right this injustice. 
  [Denisova] Vladimir Fedorovich, practical diplomacy is not 
your only and not even your first love. Many people know you 
from your books. 
  [Petrovskiy] Truly, I was right from the outset attracted 
not 
only and not so much to practical diplomatic work. "The History 
of Diplomacy," which, I recall, I read without putting it down 
almost, was published just after the war. An unknown world of 
negotiations, political battles, and striking personalities 
opened up before me--a young boy from Novosibirsk. Enrolling in 
the International Relations Institute, I knew full well even 
then that I would after graduation go into graduate work and 
would write my dissertation on the history of diplomacy. My work 
for my degree, which was devoted to the British diplomatic 
service, gained high marks, and I was recommended for graduate 
work without having to sit examinations. But this was the time 
of Khrushchev's reforms: To embark on graduate work at that time 
it was necessary to have spent two or three years in practical 
work. Thus I came to be in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 
1957. And I defended my dissertations both for my candidate's 
degree and doctorate while working in the Foreign Ministry. 
Working on my books, I studied the mechanisms of diplomacy and 
foreign policy and then switched to a study of the theory of 
international relations and the foreign policy thought of the 
United States. I subsequently wrote on such problems as 
disarmament, the European process, and international 
organizations. My latest book, which appeared in 1985, "Security 
in the Nuclear and Space Age," was devoted to the shaping of the 
new political thinking. 
  Words to the effect that there is nothing of substance in 
the 
"new political thinking concept" and that distinctions may be 
drawn only between correct and incorrect ways of thinking are to 
be heard at this time, incidentally. I cannot agree. Mankind is 
currently negotiating a change of one civilization paradigm for 
another, as was the case at the time of the transition from the 
ancient world to the Middle Ages and from the Middle Ages to the 
Renaissance. Thanks to scientific and technological progress, 
people feel themselves to be more than ever the inhabitants of 
one planet, the occupants of a common home. The new thinking is 
planetary thinking, when patriotism becomes inseparable from 
internationalism. And as far as the division of thinking into 
correct and incorrect is concerned, this is a model of the old 
way of thinking: Whoever thinks "not with us," thinks "against 
us." 
  [Denisova] In February 1992 you left the position of first 
deputy minister of foreign affairs of Russia and became deputy 
UN secretary general for policy, and in March 1993 you came 
simultaneously to head the United Nations' European Department. 
A year of work in New York and a year in Geneva--what has been 
achieved? 
  [Petrovskiy] I arrived at the United Nations in a period 
when, thanks to the end of the cold war, there had been a change 
not only in the international political environment but in the 
United Nations itself. The place of this organization in the 
changing world had to be conceptualized anew. So it was that the 
UN secretary general instructed me to take charge of work on 
preparation of his report "Agenda for Peace." This was a unique 
experiment in collective search for answers to the question of 
the role of the United Nations under the new conditions. The 
working group studied an enormous number of proposals concerning 
the renewal of the United Nations coming from both states and 
academic and other nongovernment institutions. I should mention 
with satisfaction that Russian political thought made a 
significant contribution, particularly to the elaboration of the 
concept of preventive and peacemaking diplomacy. 
  Aside from this, there was much practical work also. I was 
entrusted with negotiating a settlement of the Libyan crisis, 
took part in the elaboration of the concept and rules of 
procedure of the International Conference on the Former 
Yugoslavia, was in charge of the reorganization of the political 
machinery of the central headquarters of the United Nations, and 
was present at the birth of the first actions of preventive 
diplomacy. 
  After New York, I found myself in Geneva--the second center 
of activity of the United Nations, where the threads of the 
control of UN operations not only connected with the 
safeguarding of peace but also with socioeconomic development, a 
strengthening of democratic institutions, and the establishment 
of international standards in the sphere of science and 
technology are concentrated. Geneva has afforded enormous 
opportunities for the realization of the ideas which were 
contained in the report "Agenda for Peace." 
  A most important task is to use the unique multilateral 
negotiating mechanism available in Geneva--the Conference on 
Disarmament, whose secretariat I came to head last December--for 
the speediest preparation of an all-embracing treaty banning 
tests of nuclear weapons and to contribute to a settlement of 
conflicts and crises. 
  Another task is to provide for the interaction of the United 
Nations and European regional structures--the European Union, 
NATO, the Council of Europe, the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development, and the Conference on Security 
and Cooperation in Europe. For the United Nations this is 
exceptionally important in a practical sense because in a period 
of global change numerous problems can be resolved only in close 
interaction with regional mechanisms. And the European regional 
structures, which have built up great political capital, could 
be both a help to the United Nations and a kind of good example 
for other regimes. 
  I believe that today, when a strengthening of the existing 
mechanisms and the formation of new mechanisms of regional 
interaction are required, it is Europe that could help in both 
word and deed. And for the development of regional cooperation 
in the geopolitical space of the former Union the experience of 
West Europe would be very useful. 
  [Denisova] What, briefly, is the essence of the reform of 
the 
United Nations and its European Department? 
  [Petrovskiy] We have outlined a reform of the UN European 
Department, the purpose of which is to make Geneva a second 
global center of the United Nations. 
  The plan of action provides, first, for a decentralization 
of 
management and the endowment of the European headquarters with 
greater freedom in organizational decisionmaking and, second, 
for the most efficient use possible of the unique multilateral 
mechanisms available in Geneva and the elimination of 
duplication in their work. Geneva will be the headquarters of 
the UN high commissioner for human rights, who has just been 
appointed. 
  I believe that at least one or two sessions of the Security 
Council could perfectly well be held here annually at foreign 
minister level. 
  It is important to observe that the activity of the European 
headquarters of the United Nations could be of great interest to 
Russia also. First, the path leading to Russia's integration in 
the system of the world economy lies via Geneva. Russia's 
membership of the GATT is of priority significance in this 
connection. This would not only complete Russia's representation 
in all the most important world economic structures but would 
also afford equal opportunities for an outlet onto the world 
market. Second, unique experience of learning in all spheres has 
been accumulated here. Today, when Russia is engaged in the 
formation of the legislative foundations of the new democracy 
and new economic structures, there is no need, I believe, to be 
reinventing the wheel, it is perfectly possible to make use of 
the recommendations of international organizations, with, of 
course, an adjustment for the "road conditions" of each specific 
country. 
  [Denisova] What do you like to do in your free time, do you 
have a hobby? 
  [Petrovskiy] My life has been such that for me work is both 
service and, in a sense, a hobby because diplomacy was and is 
for me a subject of both practical and academic interest. This 
is quite convenient since I do not have any free time in any 
case. I value contacts with my diplomat colleagues, with 
friends. I am, as before, interested in art. 
  We are currently preparing for the 50th anniversary of the 
United Nations and we would like to open the Palace of Nations, 
where the European Department of the United Nations is located, 
to the public. This is an architectural monument, a striking 
work of art deco. We would like also to show the public the 
archives of the League of Nations. These archives are rich not 
only politically but also artistically. We have in our 
storerooms works of Maurice Denis, Vlaminck, Kate Kohlwitz, and 
other outstanding artists of the first half of the 20th century. 
The collection of geographical maps is an inestimable treasure 
of the Palace of Nations. Maps are, after all, not only a plan 
of terrain but also a graphic expression of political 
consciousness. 
  [Denisova] The visit to Russia of the UN secretary general 
is 
scheduled for 1 April. What do you expect from this visit? 
  [Petrovskiy] Primarily a meaningful dialogue between the UN 
secretary general and the president of Russia. Questions 
connected with a settlement of the crisis situations will be at 
the center of attention. The United Nations is today 
contributing actively to the settlement of conflicts in the 
geopolitical space of the former Union--in Georgia and 
Tajikistan. For its part, Russia is actively helping in the 
search for diplomatic solutions in the Near East and taking part 
in UN peacekeeping operations in Bosnia-Hercegovina and in 
Croatia. But this is just one aspect of the visit. Questions of 
the use of the United Nations' socioeconomic possibilities for 
the accomplishment of the tasks that confront Russia will be 
discussed also.

<F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Nikonov, doctor of historical </F>
sciences and chairman of the RF [Russian Federation] State Duma 
Subcommittee on International Security and Arms Control: 
"Partnership in the Name of NATO?"] 
  [Text] In the course of the recent heated discussion 
which took place at the plenary meeting of the State Duma 
regarding the prospects of Russia's joining in the "Partnership 
in the Name of Peace," one of the deputies called this program a 
"Partnership in the Name of NATO." Judging by the audience 
reaction, the misquote was to the liking of many, reflecting the 
Duma's cautious attitude toward this program. 
  The matter here is far from being one of conservatism or 
anti-Western sentiment of a significant portion of the deputy 
corps. It is difficult to expect a different reaction when the 
parliamentarians learn of Russia's joining in the "Partnership" 
as being an accomplished fact by reading about it in the 
newspapers. However, I will try to express in brief their doubts 
and questions. 
  1. Is the West not trying to use the "Partnership" to help 
fill the vacuum formed in Eastern Europe after the USSR, and 
later Russia, rejected the "Brezhnev doctrine," agreed with the 
unification of Germany and withdrew its troops from this region? 
After all, the non-expansion of NATO was one of the conditions 
for many of these unilateral steps. 
  2. It is understandable why NATO needs the "Partnership," 
but 
it is not quite understandable why it is needed by Russia. There 
are no real external threats from which it would be protected by 
participation in the program. Or is it necessaty for defense 
against the territorial aspirations of certain Baltic states? 
  3. For the countries of Eastern Europe, the "Partnership" is 
a step along the path to NATO, a sort of understudy membership 
in the North Atlantic block. Under such conditions, can we speak 
of Russia's participation in the program on an equal basis, 
since it turns out to be in the NATO dressing room together with 
Romania and Lithuania? And why act as the understudy, when 
Russia has the power to play for primary membership, to which it 
will hardly be accepted in the near future. 
  4. NATO was created and acted primarily as a means of 
containing communism. The world has changed. Would it not be 
better today to use the mechanism of the CSCE [Council for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe] to ensure European security, 
supplementing it with cooperation in the military sphere, and 
also to present prospective guarantees of security to the 
countries of Central and Eastern Europe on the part of Russia 
and the West? 
  5. Will the "Partnership in the Name of Peace" not inflict a 
serious decline upon the military-political integration within 
the framework of the CIS? The Commonwealth countries will 
participate in the program in an individual order, and this may 
not always correspond with their obligations within the CIS. 
  6. What are the possible domestic political consequences of 
the "Partnership" for Russia, and primarily for the export 
capacities of our VPK [military-industrial complex]? After all, 
the countries of Eastern Europe will still gravitate more toward 
the Western arms markets. Moreover, the "Partnership" is not 
free. Each country pays for participation in it from its own 
budget. The deputies have not yet seen an estimate of the cost 
of Russian participation. 
  7. Have the domestic political consequences of joining in 
the 
"Partnership" been evaluated? We cannot exclude the possibility 
that the unfavorable attitude toward NATO retained in the 
consciousness of many people will evoke an upsurge of 
nationalist rhetoric, which will play into the hands of forces 
which are far from being reformist. 
  Of course, we may also view matters from another 
perspective. 
What would happen if Russia does not take part in the 
"Partnership?" In this case, can it change something in the 
realization of the program itself or achieve anything other than 
self-isolation? The latter question is of key importance, since 
the acceleration of Russia's integration into the all-European 
structures and the strengthening of international stability are 
associated with the realization of the "Partnership." It is 
quite obvious that the State Duma will strive to achieve real 
participation in ratification of the agreement. Two paths of 
further action are emerging for the executive power. First, to 
ignore the legislators and move into the "Partnership." 
Technically this is possible if we present the "Partnership in 
the Name of Peace" as the framework of an international program, 
and not as a treaty which requires ratification. However, 
politically this is fraught with subsequent complications. The 
second means, which is more complex, is to try to convince 
public opinion and parliament of the expediency of the 
"Partnership in the Name of Peace" for Russia, and not only for 
NATO.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Konovalov, director of </F>
the United States and Canada Institute (ISKAN) Center for 
Military Policy and Systems Analysis, and Sergey Konstantinovich 
Oznobishchev, director of the ISKAN Center for Problems of 
International Security: "Partnership for Peace: The Road for 
Which Russia Has To Opt"] 
  [Text] "Many serious politicians in the West still 
believe that NATO should even now admit the countries of East 
and Central Europe to guard them against the instabilities and 
uncertainties of the development of the domestic political 
situation in Russia and possible relapses into imperial policy 
of the totalitarian state." 
  Various departments of the executive, primarily the Foreign 
Ministry, Ministry of Defense, and the Security Council, have 
reached full agreement, it would seem, concerning the expediency 
for Russia of affiliation to the "Partnership for Peace" program 
proposed in January at the meeting of NATO heads of state in 
Brussels. This was shown clearly by the visit to Moscow of U.S. 
Defense Secretary William Perry. Pavel Grachev, minister of 
defense of the Russian Federation, expressed the assumption 
following the meeting with his American colleague that the 
corresponding document could be signed before the end of March. 
And although Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev was more guarded in his 
assessment of the timeframe necessary for preparation for this 
event, there is every reason to believe that it will happen 
quite soon. 
  At the same time, on the other hand, the decision on 
Russia's 
affiliation to the NATO initiative aroused increased interest on 
the part of the legislature, and special hearings were held in 
the State Duma on the ascertainment and evaluation of the 
consequences of affiliation to the Partnership for Peace, which 
showed that a number of the people's elect do not share the 
optimism of representatives of the departments concerning the 
fact that Russia's inclusion in this program would correspond to 
its interests. The debate in the press shows that opinions in 
this connection differ among independent experts also. Fears 
that affiliation to the program would reduce Russia's space for 
foreign policy maneuver and even lead to its dangerous political 
dependence on NATO are being expressed. Theorists from the ranks 
of the neo-state absolutists are emphasizing that affiliation to 
the program would signify the creation of a "monocentric Europe 
and Russia's loss of the role of power center." But before 
attempting to take issue with sketches whose connection with the 
diversity of the political landscape would in itself seem 
arguable and to evaluate the consequences of such a step for 
Russia, we should clearly formulate what, in fact, is being 
offered our country and that with which, by all accounts, we 
have decided to associate. 
  Let us begin by saying that the mere fact of affiliation to 
the program of the Partnership for Peace (or PFP, as it is 
called for short in some analytical documents) by no means 
signifies a "deprivation of rights" and will not entail 
limitations of Russia's sovereignty or some strict financial 
obligations. The very adoption of this program was not so much a 
strategic initiative of NATO as a response to at least two 
outside factors. 
  On the one hand it is a question of concentrated pressure on 
the part of the countries of Eastern and Central Europe, which 
were endeavoring by might and main to join NATO and obtain 
guarantees of security against uncertainties of the political 
course and the possibility of a return of a totalitarian 
expansionist regime in Russia. On the other, a part was played 
by the active and cogent foreign policy course of Russia, which 
is endeavoring to prevent an expansion of the alliance and a new 
division of Europe. It was here, perhaps, that quite convincing 
arguments were found in support of the fact that an expansion of 
NATO would be contrary to its own long-term interests and would 
have negative consequences both for European security and for 
the prospects of democratic development and internal political 
stability in Russia itself. 
  Thus had there been no Partnership for Peace program, it 
would have to have been invented. For the West this program was 
largely a forced measure. It appeared as a compromise 
demonstrating on the one hand that the Western countries are 
prepared to take account of the reasonably formulated 
national-state interests of Russia and are not in the least 
interested in a destabilization of its already none-too-stable 
domestic political situation; on the other, the countries 
wishing to join NATO were offered the possibility of 
military-political cooperation, which puts off the question of 
their full membership of this organization indefinitely, 
although does not exclude it in principle. That is, in the 
difficult situation in January 1994 Russian diplomacy was able 
to score a pronounced success. This success should not now be 
lost in fruitless political debate but should be rapidly 
switched to the plane of real cooperation, it having been made 
undoubtedly attractive and beneficial for Russia. 
  The NATO initiative was formulated such as to permit quite a 
broad interpretation and the possibility of influence on its 
practical filling. Having approved the Partnership for Peace 
program, the leaders of the NATO countries expounded it in 
Brussels in two documents. One is a framework document and 
formulates the general principles and tasks of the program, the 
second is an invitation sent to potential partners wishing to 
associate with this initiative. It would seem that, following 
familiarization, the first document should not give rise to 
protest even among the toughest opponents of the one-sided 
Atlantic "pro-West" orientation of Russian foreign policy 
inasmuch as it contains goals that are common and positive for 
each normal democratic state. These are assurance of civilian 
political control over the military sphere, an expansion of 
transparency and openness in the process of the discussion and 
adoption of military budgets, cooperation in the peacekeeping 
sphere, and so forth. 
  It is extremely important to emphasize that it is in fact 
anticipated that each signatory state will develop with NATO its 
own, individual partnership program, as it were. It has at the 
same time to be noted that the so-called "invitation" to 
participate in the Partnership for Peace program contains 
statements to the effect that the NATO states "would welcome its 
expansion thanks to democratic neighbors in the East" and that 
the program itself should perform an important role "in the 
process of the evolutionary expansion of NATO." So Russia, which 
has already adopted a decision on its affiliation to the 
Partnership for Peace program, will have to determine which 
versions of its practical realization are acceptable for it and, 
having made this decision, use its influence to ensure that 
participation in it correspond as much as possible to our 
long-term national interests. But it is essential for this to 
have a clear idea of what these interests consist. There is no 
such clarity as yet. The few documents on this score, "Basic 
Provisions of the Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation" 
included, do not provide an answer to this question, although 
they do mention our country's "vitally important interests." 
True, the authors of the "Basic Provisions" allude to the fact 
that this document is merely a component of the overall concept 
of security, which has yet to be devised. But any military 
doctrine becomes a workable document only when it has support in 
the form of consensus among the main institutions of power. We 
are still a along way off from this here, it would seem. Thus 
any appeal to Russia's national interests with reference to 
"partnership for peace" cannot contain axioms and should be 
viewed on the basis of the sum total of evidence in support of 
this proposition or the other. 
  The question of whether it will not be too late after Russia 
has aligned itself with the initiative to think about its 
practical filling could arise. It would seem not inasmuch as 
formal affiliation to the PFP, that is, the signing of the 
framework document, is only the first procedural step--a kind of 
demonstration of intent. It should be followed by the 
elaboration of a "Presentation Document," which should formulate 
how Russia sees its participation in the program and the goals 
to whose achievement it aspires. Of course, it will be necessary 
here to do what Russia has traditionally disliked doing--display 
initiative, think, and act. It would be possible to opt for 
another approach which was proposed by an independent expert and 
which he formulated in a question which is almost Hamlet-like, 
but with a nuance of our national philosophy--"why join if it is 
possible not to join?" 
  This approach to foreign policy may be defined as 
entropic--minimizing the consumption of energy--but it is far 
removed from the task of assurance of Russia's vital interests. 
Underlying it is a fear as to whether Russia, having affiliated 
with the program, could somehow influence it from within. Those 
who harbor such misgivings could be reminded (granted all the 
conditionality of historical analogies) how the Socialist 
Republic of Romania formerly displayed an independence, enviable 
and dangerous for those times, within the Warsaw Pact and 
influenced the policy of this bloc in its own interests. There 
is even reason to believe that Romania made its contribution to 
the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, operating from within. So are 
Russia's possibilities to be doubted? 
  So which most important priorities of Russia's national 
security policy should be reflected in the "Presentation 
Document"? Russia categorically would not be suited by an 
expansion of NATO in the event of it remaining outside of this 
alliance. And it is not a question of the admittance of new 
members representing a direct military threat to it now or in 
the foreseeable future. Such an expansion would be perceived as 
Russia's military-political isolation and would predetermine the 
inevitability of a new division of Europe. Such a policy would 
be tantamount to the start of the building of a new version of 
the Berlin Wall, which would have moved considerably closer to 
Smolensk and Moscow, but would not for this reason have become a 
more positive factor of European security. 
  Many serious politicians in the West still believe that NATO 
should even now admit the countries of East and Central Europe 
to guard them against the instabilities and uncertainties of the 
development of the domestic political situation in Russia and 
possible relapses into imperial policy of the totalitarian state. 
  Unfortunately, Russian political reality affords grounds for 
such apprehensions. We are increasingly becoming a country not 
only with an "unpredictable past" but also an "unpredictable 
future." A number of objections to this could be found, but it 
is hard to dispute the fact that a resolution of a 
constitutional crisis with the engagement of a "limited 
contingent" of tanks and combat operations in the center of the 
capital did not serve to strengthen the conviction in Europe or 
throughout the world as to the irreversibility of the policy of 
reforms and democracy. And the results of the December elections 
by no means induced anyone to finally cast aside all doubts 
concerning the prospects of civilian democratic rule in Russia. 
Strobe Talbott, first deputy U.S. secretary of state, recently 
declared that he was worried about the fate of the democratic 
reforms in Russia and believes that, in the event of their 
failure and a recoil to totalitarianism in Russia, the 
Partnership for Peace initiative could serve also as a 
protective barrier against its expansion. 
  At the same time any serious expert is well aware that 
neither now nor in the foreseeable future will Russia, while 
remaining a strong military power, be in a position, for all 
that, to "project" this might outside of its national territory, 
even less outside of the territory of the former USSR. So what 
is the point of building a system of protection against a threat 
which does not exist and which cannot appear in the near future, 
provoking internal political shifts in Russia that could, even 
though not rapidly, make this threat real. 
  This conclusion also testifies in support of the need for 
Russian affiliation to the Partnership for Peace program 
inasmuch as without it this initiative would become a NATO 
"preparatory class," and the entry into the alliance of new 
members would only be a matter of time. That is, it should be 
stated clearly that Russia will subscribe to the program, 
considering it essential to counterpose to the expansion of NATO 
a positive alternative--the creation within the framework of 
this program of the foundation of a future system of European 
security, in which Russia and the countries of East and Central 
Europe are subsequently integrated as NATO's equal partners. 
  At the same time, on the other hand, Russia's affiliation to 
the program with the aim of its speediest membership of NATO, 
before its former allies even, perhaps, would be, it would seem, 
a serious strategic mistake. It is the Eurasian aspect of 
Russia's interests that is important here. We would recall how 
the report prepared by the Foreign Intelligence Service of the 
Russian Federation argued the unacceptability of an expansion of 
NATO for Russia. It pointed out as a most important reason that 
the very approach, without hostile intentions even, to the 
borders of Russia of a military grouping with such offensive 
potential as NATO would fundamentally change the 
military-strategic situation and compel it to adopt the 
appropriate countermeasures in the approaches to military 
organizational development, the disposition and number of force 
groupings deployed, and so forth. 
  We can imagine quite unambiguously the negative reaction of 
China or other Asian neighbors of Russia when it transpires that 
they border a new military-political alliance whose offensive 
potential is composed of the potentials of NATO, at least 16 
other European countries, and Russia. It would certainly have to 
be recognized that the Asian states bordering Russia, primarily 
China, would in this case be entitled to take adequate steps, 
which would unequivocally have a negative effect on security and 
stability in the region and in the world as a whole. 
Consequently, it is essential even now to display concern to 
ensure that the building of a system of European security with 
Russia's participation not be perceived as a threat to the 
Muslim countries or China. It is essential that Russia display 
particular punctiliousness on this issue inasmuch as it is far 
more vulnerable than the European countries to possible 
retaliatory measures on the part of its Asian neighbors. 
  Another important argument expressed by opponents of the 
program in Russia consists of fears of a loss of the traditional 
markets for the sale of Russian arms in the European countries 
that formerly belonged to the Warsaw Pact. Mr. Zatulin, chairman 
of the State Duma Committee for Relations with the CIS and 
Compatriots' Affairs, even indicates that Russia's affiliation 
to the Partnership for Peace would signify "the death of 
Russia's military-industrial complex." It would seem that such 
misgivings fail to take account of at least two factors. First, 
the NATO program itself by no means implies a transition to some 
common standard weapons systems. As far as its further 
development is concerned, much here should depend on our own 
position. 
  Second, the talk about the death of Russia's 
military-industrial complex because of the loss of the East 
European markets would seem somewhat exaggerated for purely 
economic reasons. According to the figures of a most 
authoritative source in this sphere--the Stockholm International 
Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)--total arms exports from Russia 
in 1992 constituted $2.043 billion, of which arms totaling $139 
million were sold to developed countries, to which our East 
European customers pertain, that is, less than 7 percent of the 
total. And whereas, what is more, our arms exports in the period 
1990 through 1992 to the developing countries declined by a 
factor of 3.5, to the developed countries, by a factor of 22.4. 
So events on the arms markets in the East European countries 
undesirable for us were taking place even before the appearance 
of the Partnership for Peace program. What has been said by no 
means signifies that Russia should not fight for the possibility 
of sales of its arms to the East European countries. But the 
Partnership for Peace creates no obstacles to this. On the 
contrary, new opportunities, which, however, may be realized 
only in keen competitive struggle, could, possibly, emerge for 
Russia's military-industrial complex within the framework of 
this program. 
  One further fear voiced by the opponents of affiliation to 
the Partnership for Peace is connected with the fact that other 
states of the CIS would fasten onto this program also (some have 
already done so, others are about to) and that this would 
undermine the fragile prospects of military-political 
integration within the CIS that have begun to emerge. We should 
probably agree that the formulation of a coordinated approach to 
the NATO initiative on the part of the states of the CIS, the 
members of the Tashkent Collective Security Treaty at least, 
would be advisable. But what has prevented or is preventing us 
doing this and discussing it within the CIS? 
  So the numerous declarations concerning the end of the cold 
war and our calls concerning the need for transition from 
confrontation to strategic partnership are beginning to move 
into the sphere of practical action. Russia should undoubtedly 
take this step. It would be incomprehensible, to say the least, 
why we, who have said so much about our aspiration to partner 
relations, would suddenly attempt to distance ourselves from 
them, condemning ourselves to self-isolation. Participation in 
them would by no means signify a disregard for Russia's national 
interests. But what would undoubtedly have to be renounced would 
be cliches of confrontational thinking and bipolar, trench logic. 
  It should be regretfully acknowledged that the transition to 
partner relations with the West has occurred largely in words, 
at the declarative level, and has affected to a considerably 
lesser extent the sphere of actual policy. The presence, as 
before, of the inordinately military component of our superpower 
status, nuclear weapons included, and the extreme internal 
political instability demand particular attention and dictate 
the need for Russia's affiliation to the Partnership for Peace 
program on special terms (the nature thereof could be agreed 
preliminarily and formalized in an individual partnership 
program). Nonetheless, it is impossible to confine ourselves to 
these considerations. Russia has performed and will continue to 
perform an outstanding role in Europe and the world not only in 
the military-political respect. No serious analyst even today 
could dispute the presence in our country of enormous potential 
in literally all spheres. 
  The normal workmanlike process not only of Russia's 
affiliation to this program but also of our country's entry into 
partner relations is being hampered by the evolved nature of the 
discussion of most important foreign policy questions, which can 
often only be called discussion by stretching the point. The 
actual path of the formulation of decisions and the role and 
place therein of the newly elected parliament, which for some 
reason or other joined in the discussion of "partnership" when 
the executive had in practice already determined the timeframe 
of Russia's entry into this program, would seem chaotic, as 
before. Discussion of any important matter, the Partnership for 
Peace included, is frequently regarded not from the viewpoint of 
Russia's actual interests but through the prism of the 
opportunist interests of politicians' extension of the time of 
their stay in the upper echelons of power (particularly with the 
prospect of new elections for everyone within two years). 
  It is clear that performing purposeful work on the 
elaboration of policy and on the assurance of Russia's national 
interests, within the framework of "partnership" included, is 
far more complex than "not joining." After all, it is in this 
key sphere for future security that there have been more words 
than deeds. It is a long time since we heard our own proposals 
in this field, not simply belated "responses" to the development 
of events. Nor, finally, would it do any harm to determine our 
position as regards the basic postulates of the foundation of 
all partner relations--Russia's national interests and their 
priorities. 
  It was recently learned, incidentally, that Switzerland, 
which is proud of its long neutrality, has decided to affiliate 
with the Partnership for Peace in the near future. It does not 
intend to renounce its neutral status, is not planning to join 
NATO, and is not even about to take part in joint military 
maneuvers. At the same time, on the other hand, Switzerland is 
unwilling to remain aloof from the process of military-political 
integration in Europe. But if such a small state is not afraid 
to align itself with the program, should Russia be guided by 
baseless fears?

<F P=106> [Article by Richard Ovinnikov, doctor of historical </F>
sciences, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, under 
rubric "Diplomatic Paths": "Russia's Inalienable Rights: 
Memorandum for Foreign-Political Partners"] 
  [Text] The East-West confrontation and the Cold War have 
come to an end. On the horizon is the coming into being of a new 
model of the world. In overall features that model must be based 
on cooperation among states and, naturally, must include the 
Russia Federation as an integral part. 
  Nevertheless there is something not quite right in this rosy 
haze, in any case for us Russians. Too many questions have 
accumulated to make it possible to ponder on them aloud. But the 
most important point is the following: on the part of certain of 
our partners, unlike the rather good declarations, one actually 
senses the deaf imperception of Russia's legal rights in the 
international arena, which are equal to other inalienable rights 
of Russia. Such as those that the carrying out of which, for 
themselves, these partners reckon in the rank of natural 
national interests. Such as those that Russia intends to promote 
not in order to bypass the generally accepted behavioral norms 
for states, but strictly within their confines. 
  In this situation it is apparently beneficial to prepare a 
business memorandum for our partners (as well as for ourselves) 
that is aimed at removing any misunderstandings. A memorandum, 
first of all, about the healthy and constructive, in our view, 
strivings of Russia in the outside world, and, secondly, about 
why it is difficult for us to accept our partners' lack of 
readiness to take them into consideration. 
  The first is, indisputably, the right of the Russian 
Federation to be reborn as a great power, the right to eliminate 
the frustrated position in which it has found itself. 
  This task is not a challenge to anyone, but it is a defense 
of national interests. Situations that were extremely similar 
after World War II were De Gaulle's course aimed at restoring 
the grandeur of France and the restoration by China of its 
positions as a great power. No one saw anything unnatural in 
this. Therefore one would scarcely think that it is possible to 
agree with the fact that similar strivings by Russia are being 
treated today as imperial vanities. Moreover, this is being 
presented on the level of the most highly placed 
foreign-political leaders of the recent past and as a conceptual 
theory: allegedly the "constant threat" against the West is 
immanently inherent through the centuries to any Russia, 
"tsarist or Soviet" (H. Kissinger), or, as a subvariant, to 
"Great Russian imperialism" (Z. Brezinski). 
  What are unacceptable are the sometimes cutting, albeit on 
another level, expectations that are directly hostile to Russia. 
Unfortunately, there are plenty of examples. A research study by 
the Carnegie Foundation in Washington that was published on the 
eve of last year predicted that the Russian Federation would not 
survive the year 1993 and would collapse. The London ECONOMIST, 
in its turn, gave the following predictions on the same subject: 
"This disintegration is not necessarily bad... Everything 
depends on whether that disintegration will be orderly." 
  The second is Russia's inalienable right to security that is 
equal with other powers. 
  For every country the primary guarantee of security is to 
assure that there are no complications on the part of neighbors, 
and that their territory does not become a corridor through 
which third forces can travel. The removal of this problem by 
political methods, on the basis of voluntary cooperation, is 
universally positive in its consequences. That was the situation 
with the understanding between France and Germany, which 
countries undertook, after confrontation in two world wars, to 
establish smooth bilateral relations The United States and 
Canada, which also waged war with one another at one time, 
refused to reinforce their common border, actually integrating 
their military organizations. That is their right. 
  The striving by the Russian Federation to prevent at least a 
movement backward in its own security is therefore logical. 
Hence the desire to preserve the reliable ties in this area that 
developed among the current CIS countries. This is the sphere of 
the previous single military structure, and one sees preserved 
in it both the important strong points of Russia itself, and the 
joint interest of the CIS participants in taking joint action. 
But wherever, as in the Baltic and East Europe, cooperation in 
guaranteeing security is rejected by the other side, Russia 
proceeds from the critical minimum. Namely, not to be faced by a 
situation in which the former republics of the USSR and its 
previous allies are included in a military bloc of which Russia 
is not a member. 
  The third is the legal right of the Russian Federation to 
lack of discrimination in the world economy. Russians do not 
feel that someone else is supposed to pull their country out of 
its current difficulties. This is their own task. But what 
Russia naturally expects if the proposal is made that it become 
integrated into the world economy is to have completely equal 
conditions. 
  The time has come to remove the trade, economic, and other 
barriers. But, instead of this, quota limitations sometimes 
appear. And it is completely improper to strive to use our 
problems as a lever for exerting pressure. Just as, according to 
the Russian Ministry of Finance, the creditor banks in the 
London Club would like to pay off our debts by means of the 
forced sale of Russia's property abroad. 
  Finally, the Russian Federation has the undisputed right to 
have its special interests taken into consideration in the 
international situations that are important to it. 
  The specific concerns of any country are more the norm than 
an exception. It is only important for good will to be 
manifested and for the partner's interests to be taken into 
consideration. Just as, for example, it is typical for the 
relations between the United States and Japan. 
  Thus, the present factual situation can scarcely cause 
satisfaction. In the proclaimed postconfrontational world it is 
still a long way to truly parity partner relations, at least to 
the extent that this pertains to respect for the rights and 
interests of the Russian Federation.

<F P=106> [Report by Nikita Yermakov: "Russian Parliamentarism </F>
Receives International Recognition: Vladimir Shumeyko's First 
Official Visit Abroad"] 
  [Text] Paris--Over the entire past week, the French capital 
was host to the scheduled 91st session of the Interparliamentary 
Union, which currently unites 128 parliaments in the world. 
Participating in its work in the capacity of chairman of the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly allowed the head of the upper 
chamber of the Russian parliament to take part in the discussion 
of some of the most burning issues on the agenda--prevention of 
conflicts and the United Nations' role in this; ensuring the 
safety of industrial waste storage; and nonproliferation of 
nuclear weapons. 
  Of all the meetings, the most significant were those held 
with the heads of the French National Assembly and the Senate, 
as well as in Strasbourg with the Council of Europe [CE] 
leadership. 
  "At this point Franco-Russian parliamentary relations are 
still not on an equal footing," says Vladimir Shumeyko. "France 
has lived under a parliamentary system for about 100 years, 
Russia--since 12 December of last year." 
  One way or the other, however, the dialogue, in which both 
parties speak the same language, has begun. It was especially 
noticeable during the negotiations in Strasbourg. The topic was 
Russia's membership of the Council of Europe. 
  Until now, the situation was as follows: Russia, which had 
the status of a special-invitation observer in the CE, was 
refused membership in the organization until it acquired a 
democratic constitution and a democratically elected parliament. 
Now these conditions have been met, but the CE leadership was in 
no hurry to consider Moscow's request until the very last 
moment. According to informed sources, such caution was the 
result not only of the unpredictability of Russia's development, 
which is frightening to some here, but also, among other things, 
of the fact that in the past the Russian side was insisting that 
exceptions be made for it, and on immediate and unconditional 
membership in the CE. Now that the Russian participants in the 
dialogue have changed, these demands have been withdrawn. After 
the negotiations in Strasbourg, the procedure of acceptance will 
begin--quite long and in stages, actually. There are all reasons 
to believe, the Russian side assures, that as early as the fall, 
or under any circumstances before the end of the year, Russia 
may become a full-fledged member of the Council of Europe, and 
feel like a normal democratic power, participating in the 
solution of European problems in this capacity.

<F P=106> [Article by Vasiliy Lipitskiy: "The East Remains Silent: </F>
Russia's Abandonment of One-Sided Atlantism Is Possible Only 
With a More Active Position of the Arab World"] 
  [Text] The Arab world is looking on with inexplicable 
indifference as its long-term strategic interests and, perhaps, 
foundations of prosperity also are being undermined in Russia. 
What this is: traditional submission to fate and recognition of 
its impotence or, on the contrary, some subtle calculation, is 
unclear. The East is, as always, enigmatic and obscure for the 
European mind. 
  The formerly firm ties with Arab world have come to be 
regarded--even though this has not been recorded in official 
documents--as the onerous legacy of the ancien regime and as 
communist geopolitics. Truly, there was in these ties that which 
is not usually greatly to the liking of the public at 
large--indirect participation in regional conflicts, arms trade, 
and support for rulers unpopular in the world. But there were 
undoubted pluses also--mutually profitable economic relations 
and influence in the vast region. All this has been sacrificed 
to ideological changes. 
  But it would be an exaggeration to say that the door to 
Russia was suddenly slammed shut in the face of the Arab 
countries and to place the whole responsibility with the Russian 
side. It is simply that the West was better able to take 
advantage of the favorable political conditions. The Arab world 
failed to display the necessary mobility, yielding important 
strategic positions practically without resistance. And this in 
a situation where its interests were objectively very close to 
Russian interests. 
  Russian producers, desperately in need of currency receipts, 
are prepared to sell their products for a pittance even. The 
result is a catastrophic fall in the price of oil and many types 
of mineral raw material. Farsighted emissaries of the West are 
penetrating Russia's oil and gas complex ever more deeply and 
endeavoring to participate in the control of the extractive 
sectors. Considering the calamitous position of the latter, it 
is clear how easy this is--all investments are seen as a 
blessing. 
  It is not hard to foresee in the near future a further 
decline in the influence of the Organization of Oil-Exporting 
Countries and a fall in the revenue of the traditional producers 
of mineral raw material. And a further strengthening of the 
positions of the West and an increase in the gap between North 
and South. And although Russia is geographically a northern 
country, economically it will shortly be somewhere around the 
Equator, but without an improvement in climate. Arab investments 
in Russia's oil and gas complex of the appropriate scale offered 
on favorable terms against subsequent partnership could 
appreciably adjust this joyless prospect. But the East remains 
silent. 
  Another sphere of the concurrence of the objective interests 
of Russia and the Arab countries is the arms trade. In the 
Russian Federation the manufacture of weapons is one of the few 
competitive industries. It is in a state of the most profound 
crisis in connection with demilitarization and the loss of a 
number of traditional markets: Iraq, Libya, Palestine. The Arab 
world remains the most attractive partner for our arms 
manufacturers. But the Atlantic orientation of our foreign 
policy and the growing direct dependence on the West are 
becoming an insurmountable barrier to mutually profitable 
relations. 
  Here also the Arab world, having aroused the direct 
producers' interest by investments, could rectify matters. But 
dealers from the East are not to be seen at the defense plants, 
which are being forced to halt their production lines one after 
the other. 
  In a social and cultural respect the Western world is closer 
to Russia than the Arab East. But the structure of economic 
interests should be a far more important imperative for 
politicians. 
  How is the situation to be changed? Serious political 
changes 
and the renunciation of the one-sided Atlantism of foreign 
policy are needed for this in Russia. But such changes, in turn, 
are possible only with the more active position of the Arab 
world. 
  Assistance to Russia and investments in its economy are at 
the present time a risky and overhead-laden business. The West 
is, nonetheless, agreeing to this in the name of its future and 
its strategic interests. 
  The Arab world, which possesses considerable spare financial 
resources, should put them to use if it wishes in the future 
also to be a pronounced factor of geopolitics and to retain the 
possibility of participation in control of the world oil market. 
This means not only replacing the West where this is 
possible--in the investment process--but also offering better 
terms. And if the West declines assistance programs in the face 
of this reorientation of Russia, being prepared to compensate 
the losses connected with this. 
  Whether the proposed scenario proves another oriental legend 
will depend solely on the capacity of Arab and Russian 
politicians for recognizing imperatives dictated by the national 
interests of both parties.

<F P=106> Article by Professor Ilya Mogilyovkin: "Russia's </F>
Transportation Connections Are Jeopardized: The Problem of the 
Black Sea Straits Is on the Agenda Again." The article is under 
the rubric "Law."] 
  [Text] More and more reports are coming out about Turkey's 
intentions to attain changes in the Convention governing the 
procedures for the Bosporus and the Dardanelles that connect the 
Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The issue concerns a change 
that is very important for Russia's interests, the so-called 
Montreux Convention, signed in 1936 by twelve countries, 
including the USSR and Turkey. This convention provides for the 
free passage of freighters of all countries through the straits 
and contains procedures for the passage of warships of countries 
bordering on the Black Sea, as well as other countries. 
  The Black Sea straits are of vital interest for Russia's 
maritime trade and that of other Black Sea countries. In recent 
times, up to 16,000 vessels per year have passed through the 
Bosporus and the Dardanelles Straits. Of the freight 
transported, especially important are exports of oil and natural 
gas. Their share of the total volume transported is over 60 
percent. 
  Now Turkey is trying to establish more stringent rules for 
the passage of vessels in a number of categories. Accordingly, 
vessels carrying oil or any dangerous cargo must inform the 
relevant Turkish authorities at least 24 hours prior to the 
proposed passage. A much stricter regulation is supposed to 
apply to tankers equipped with nuclear engines or to those 
having nuclear waste or chemical freight on board. Captains will 
have to receive permission for through passage from the Turkish 
Secretariat for Naval Affairs and take a local navigator on 
board. In essence, therefore, what is being planned for 
implementation is not a procedure to inform, but to have to 
request permission for certain categories of ships to pass 
through the Straits. Meanwhile, it is known that under these 
procedures, ships could be delayed while permission is being 
sought. 
  Moreover, according to available information, Turkey has 
announced that in the future it does not intend to permit 
passage of supertankers through the Straits. 
  Turkish authorities, in giving reasons for their intention 
to 
institute new procedures for passage of civilian freighters 
through the Black Sea straits, are saying that tankers could 
present an ecological danger for Istanbul and other maritime 
cities in the event of an accident in the Bosporus. 
  Turkey's intent to change the procedures in the straits 
directly touch upon Russian interests, since over a half of all 
goods carried by Russian vessels engaged in maritime trade go 
through the Black Sea straits. Specifically, Russia principally 
loads oil and other liquid materials for export in Black Sea 
ports. In connection with this, even recognizing the need for 
taking ecological requirements into consideration, Russia's 
concern cannot be ignored when her fundamental interests are at 
stake. 
  Russia's concern is all the more justified because the 
Turkish initiative to change the procedures cannot be examined 
in isolation from a whole number of important issues. 
  After the fall of the USSR, Russia was faced with an overall 
serious deterioration in her transport and communications 
systems, especially in the most important connecting routes with 
the West through the Baltics and Ukraine. Under these 
conditions, preservation of Russian interests that depend upon 
uninterrupted sea transport through the Black Sea and the 
straits becomes immensely important. 
  At the same time, very weighty concepts are being raised 
from 
a legal point of view with regard to the Turkish initiative. 
  The limitations on free passage of commercial vessels 
through 
the Black Sea straits, as proposed by Turkey, are in conflict 
with the Montreux Convention now in force. For this reason, the 
question arises about how present legal procedures will 
influence vessel passage in the future, not only in the Black 
Sea straits, but also in other international straits, including 
those where maritime commerce is important for Russia too. In 
other words, changing procedures in the Bosporus and Dardanelles 
may serve as a dangerous precedent for certain other straits. 
  The attempt to change the Montreux Convention, if the change 
takes place, also raises the question about possible legal 
reference points that may be selected for approving procedures 
for the passage of ships. Without any doubt, the most 
authoritative document is the UN Convention on Maritime Law 
signed in 1982 and subsequently ratified by many countries. It 
would not be right to ignore this important document when 
looking into possible changes in procedures. 
  At the same time, it is extremely important to delineate as 
clearly as possible Russian interests under new and not so 
simple transport and communications conditions. In so doing, it 
is essential to take into account not only the Black Sea straits 
themselves, but also the "overall" significance of the straits 
problem for Russia, as was mentioned above. This is why it is 
very important that problems with regard to the Straits be 
resolved as openly and publicly as possible. It would be highly 
desirable for the press to devote its attention to these 
problems and to inform the broadest possible readership about 
these problems. The multi-faceted nature of the straits problem 
affects the interests of many people in Russia, both as an 
industrial and a regional issue. 
  Only if these issues are broadly and constantly brought up 
by 
the mass media will it be possible to avert serious losses 
similar to those that Russia is suffering now in many aspects of 
her transport ties with the near abroad, as well as with more 
distant foreign countries.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Vostrikov, candidate of historical </F>
sciences: "Russian Foreign Policy Priorities in Asia--The Ethics 
of Pragmatism and Common Sense"] 
  [Text] It is generally known that for the international 
influence of any state, "professionalism of foreign policy is 
very important." (F.M. Burlatskiy, A.A. Galkin. "The Modern 
Leviathan." Moscow: MYSL, 1985, p. 317). An accurate assessment 
of the correlation of forces, the ability to determine a precise 
position under adverse conditions, the ability to select proper 
allies and partners--may compensate to a certain degree for 
diminished economic potential and retarded dynamics of 
development. This is especially urgent for the Russia of today, 
which for certain reasons is undergoing one of the most critical 
periods of its history. In order to avoid failure and subjective 
defeats under such conditions, the foreign policy of the state 
must be equal to the situation being endured. This can be done, 
in our view, only if policy is based on fully realistic and 
rational foundations which conform first and foremost to the 
interests of Russia itself, and not on mythical or abstract 
concepts oriented on theoretical considerations removed from 
real life. 
  We are talking about bringing the foreign policy of the 
Russian Federation into conformance with the principles 
comprising the basis of foreign policy activity of the developed 
democracies that constitute reference points for Russia. In 
effecting the transition to a market economy, we must not forget 
that "capitalism brought along with it the ethics of pragmatism, 
the ethics of common sense. A lofty idealism resided in its 
slogans of freedom, equality, and brotherhood, but it was an 
idealism based on a sensible, utilitarian accounting of 
realities." (A.N. Yakovlev. "Prelude. Cataclysm. Epilogue." 
Moscow: NOVOSTI, 1992, p. 276). It is pragmatism and common 
sense, in our view, that would advisably be put at the 
foundation of the foreign policy strategy of the Russian state 
under today's conditions. From this point of view the question 
of selection of priority partners may be examined--with respect 
to both the "near" and "far" abroad. 
  Relations with its great neighbor of the Far 
East--China--will be of primary and vital significance to the 
Russian Federation. These affect not just the interests of 
Russia in Asia, but the entirety of Russia's international 
policy. As it develops in dynamic fashion, China is today 
playing an ever more prominent role in the Asia-Pacific region. 
"No single Asian power in the Asia-Pacific region has at its 
disposal the universal and powerful influence that belongs to 
the People's Republic of China." (S.V. Solodovnik. "Stability in 
Asia--Russia's Priority." MEZHDUNARODNAYA ZHIZN, 1992, No. 2, p. 
88). Expert analyses predict that in the future, China will be 
quite capable of assuming a leading position in world politics 
(a number of analysts even predict that the People's Republic of 
China will turn into a superpower in the 21st century). An 
expansion of mutually advantageous cooperation with the PRC will 
conform to Russia's interests in developing its economic 
infrastructure in the Maritime Kray region, Siberia, Sakhalin, 
and Kamchatka. In the long term, should events develop 
favorably, it is felt that the Chinese "springboard" could 
facilitate to a certain degree the emergence of Russian capital 
in the markets of Southeast Asia, where Chinese business "is a 
permanent element of the socioeconomic structure of countries of 
the region." (S. Goncharenko. "Partners or Competitors--How 
Regional Chinese Capital Operates in the Countries of Southeast 
Asia." VOPROSY EKONOMIKI, 1992, No. 3, p. 113). 
  The experience of the PRC's transition to a market economy 
is 
interesting in many respects and may prove quite useful to the 
Russian Federation (especially since when one takes a sober look 
at things, it is impossible not to see that during a 
historically short period of time the PRC has been able to 
approach the real market far more closely than the Russian 
Federation, where a greater role has been devoted to talk). 
  In laying the foundation of Russian-Chinese relations today, 
we are obliged to proceed from the long-term perspective, first 
and foremost from a clear realization of the immutable fact that 
China and Russia are fated to be neighbors forever, regardless 
of whether one is pleased at this or not. 
  Of great significance to the security of Russia's interests 
in the South and Central Asian regions is the preservation of 
continuity in the development of relations with India. 
Settlement of the problem of India's payment to Russia of its 
long-term state credit debt opens up broad opportunities for the 
development of mutually beneficial cooperation in the sphere of 
trade, shipping, space research, modern technology exchange, and 
exchanges in the military-technical sphere. India's 
implementation of a large-scale program of economic reforms, 
during which it "opens up new spheres for the application of 
capital" (FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, 18-24 February 1993) will 
create favorable conditions for Russian investors, 
joint-stockholders, and private entrepreneurial structures. 
Since time immemorial the peoples of India and Russia have come 
to share deep-rooted traditions of humanitarian and cultural 
cooperation. In addition, expansion of the Russia-India 
political partnership contributes towards the consolidation of 
stability in Hindustan and throughout Central Asia as well. This 
is of major significance to Russia. 
  Prospects for developing and intensifying ties with Russia's 
Eurasian "twin"--Turkey--appear to be promising and advantageous 
for Russia. Quite a number of historic parallels can be seen in 
the development of the two countries. Over the course of 
centuries, Turkey, like Russia, has played the part of a unique 
"bridge" between East and West, not belonging to one or the 
other. Like its northern neighbor, Turkey has had to endure the 
agonizing process of surmounting the empire syndrome and 
effecting transition to a modern (secular) model of state 
structure. Today Turkey, just like Russia, is resolving complex 
problems of economic modernization. The history of Russo-Turkish 
relations records a great many pages of drama and even tragedy. 
At the same time, the past also contains a positive experience 
of cooperation between the Russian Federation and Republic of 
Turkey of the days of Kemal Ataturk. The similarity of 
historical experience and economic systems of the two countries 
presupposes their compatibility and complementary nature. This 
experience is also valuable because today in Russia and other 
CIS states, "with the conduct of liberalization of the economy, 
a number of trends are being observed that operated in Turkey 
during the 1980's. They deal with the fate of state enterprises, 
pace and forms of privatization, and development of the 
financial market." (S. Avdashev. "Turkey--A National Model of 
Liberalization of the Economy." 1992, No. 11, p. 101). Nor would 
it be in Russia's interests to ignore the strong influence 
Turkey has in the Caucasus, the Balkans, Central Asia, and the 
Black Sea region. 
  Capability for a constructive and highly effective 
relationship is seen in the prospects for partnership between a 
renewed Russia and Israel, where a tremendous Russian-speaking 
community has formed that exerts significant influence on the 
political, economic, and cultural life of the state. "One-fourth 
are our former people"--as the words of the famous poet express 
it. This is not only a natural and vital element linking the two 
countries, but a powerful factor of rapprochement between Russia 
and Israel as well. Repatriates from Russia have significant 
capacities at their disposal for rendering intermediary services 
in trade between the West and Russia, in investing capital in 
the Russian Federation economy on a long-term basis, and in 
implementing joint projects in both countries. Prospects appear 
good for cooperation in the development of tourism, trade in 
subtropical crops, processing and sale of diamonds, and in the 
sphere of scientific research. The development of relations 
between Russia and Israel would provide a weighty contribution 
to stabilization of the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean, 
facilitating settlement of one of the most deep-rooted and 
complex problems of modern times--the problem of the Near East. 
It is important to emphasize in this regard that the deepening 
of Russian-Israeli relations cannot and must not be effected at 
the expense or to the detriment of Russia's traditional ties 
with the Arab world (in particular, with Egypt, Palestine, 
Syria, and Kuwait). On the whole, orientation on the Near East 
should, in our view, constitute one of the priority directions 
in foreign policy strategy of the Russian Federation in Asia. 
  In the "near" abroad, of exceptionally great long-term 
relevance to the national security and interests of our state is 
Kazakhstan, covering the "soft underbelly" of Russia and linking 
it with the countries of Central Asia at the same time. The 
geographic position of Kazakhstan, its virgin lands, natural and 
raw-material resources, developed industrial infrastructure, and 
the largest Russian-speaking diaspora outside the borders of the 
Russian Federation make it objectively urgently necessary to 
effect the very closest coordination and integration (a 
"strategic alliance," if you will) in all spheres of activity 
between Russia and Kazakhstan. 
  The traditional gravitation of Armenia towards Russia is to 
a 
great extent the result of the particular features of its 
historical development and geopolitical situation. Occupying a 
central position in the Transcaucasus and essentially 
constituting the "key" to all of Asia Minor, Armenia is located 
at a unique juncture of two worlds--the Christian and Islamic 
worlds. Such a position has its obvious pluses as well as 
minuses. Armenia's advantageous geographic position, its solid 
intellectual potential, and the presence of a large and 
diversified diaspora in many countries of the world, including 
in Russia itself, make prospects for the development of stable 
and all-encompassing cooperation between Russia and Armenia 
quite promising. 
  Rich mineral and energy resources, developed 
livestock-breeding, climatological and balneological factors, 
and the presence of suitable economic "recesses," have created 
favorable preconditions for cooperation between Russia and 
Kyrgyzstan. Not of minor significance to the Russian Federation 
is the presence in Kyrgyzstan of a large Russian-speaking 
community that plays an important role in the socioeconomic and 
scientific life of the state. 
  The high-priority nature of relations between Russia and 
Uzbekistan has been determined by an aggregate of factors in the 
geostrategic, economic, and cultural spheres, as well as by 
historical tradition. The heart of the "mid-territory" of the 
Central Asian region, Uzbekistan "is not only a buffer zone, the 
boundary between the former USSR and the Islamic countries, but 
is the place where new ideas and the reality of a new world 
structure intersect." (M. Timonina. "They Are Aided By the Black 
Rock, We--By the Golden Crucifix" SOTSIUM, 1992, No. 6, p. 41). 
The interdependence of the economies of the two states, trade 
ties that have become a permanent fixture, and civilized and 
humanitarian traditions going back centuries upon centuries 
constitute a solid foundation for profitable cooperation on a 
broad scale. 
  In this manner, with all the dissimilarity, diversity, and 
nonuniformity with respect to the above-enumerated countries, 
there exist certain substantive aspects and features that are 
intrinsic to a greater or lesser degree to practically all of 
them. It is these most typical features which, in our view, 
could be laid within the foundation of a system of criteria for 
selecting priority partners in both the "near" and "far" abroad. 
Their universal nature makes it possible, in our view, to 
utilize this system beyond the boundaries of the Asian continent 
as well. 
  Thus, in selecting priority partners for the Russian 
Federation abroad, the main focus of attention must be 
concentrated on the following fundamental parameters: 
  --mutual compatibility of economies, approximate 
comparability of economic development; 
  --"key" nature of the geopolitical position of partners; 
  --internal stability; 
  --the secular principle in organization of state power. 
  We know that the main foreign policy task of any state is to 
ensure its internal development. As it applies to Russia's 
present conditions, this means primarily the preservation of the 
country's economic potential and the safeguarding of political 
stability, and not simply physical survival within the existing 
state borders. Proceeding from this, the economy must be set as 
the cornerstone, while the foreign policy itself of the Russian 
Federation is subordinated to economic interests. Such 
pragmatism in policy does not constitute anything 
extraordinary--quite a number of countries in the world espouse 
such an approach to their benefit. Nor does this run contrary to 
the interests of the world community. Cooperation between the 
Russian Federation and the above-mentioned partners will enable 
it to actively participate in collective efforts to resolve 
regional conflicts in the Near East, the Transcaucasus, and 
Central Asia, thus contributing significantly to the 
consolidation of international stability. 
  Rivalry in the international arena remains with us and will 
continue in the post-confrontational world. Under these 
conditions, only sober calculations, realism, and pragmatism can 
guarantee the success of foreign policy efforts. Russian 
philosopher Nikolay Berdyayev heaped severe criticism upon 
abstract doctrinaires in politics who proclaimed general 
principles without regard to relevant vital tasks and the given 
moment in history. "The oversimplified abnegation of problems 
and the specifics of the history in which any politics is formed 
is an indicator of mediocrity or superficiality in this area," 
he emphasized, "or a lack of interest in this sphere of 
existence, an absence of calling to it." (A.N. Berdyayev. "The 
Fate of Russia." Moscow: 1990, p. 215). These words are 
exceedingly relevant today. It is entirely apparent that even 
today the adjective "free" as it pertains to Russia "is still 
very difficult for our top brass to utter..." (Yu. Boldyrev. 
"The Russian Era." IZVESTIYA, 6 February 1993). It is therefore 
entirely logical to assume that without freedom of thought, 
freedom to choose our own path of development, freedom to 
determine our own Russian interests and priorities, the danger 
of dogmatism in the foreign policy sphere will continue to exist.

<F P=106> [Article by PRAVDA correspondent Viktor Pritula: "All Flags </F>
Come To Visit, Except Russian"] 
  [Text] Hanoi--The economic blockade of Vietnam is 
lessening by the day. The Americans, for instance, understand 
very well that any prospective economic niche will be filled by 
their competitors. Even Austria did not remain out of the 
action. Its government delegation signed an agreement on 
construction of various communications projects. 
  I cannot cease being amazed by the powers of observation and 
wit of my friend Linh Van Nhan. A specialist on Russia, he 
regularly watches information programs on the "Ostankino" 
channel. And once in a while comments on them. His latest 
comment: "The ghost of the unforgettable Leonid Ilich has 
returned to the Kremlin." 
  "What makes you think so?" I ask, perplexed. 
  "From watching Clinton's visit," replies Linh Van Nhan, 
without blinking an eye. "You know very well how such historic 
visits used to be covered in the past on the 'Vremya' program." 
  Needless to say, the dean of the Russian language department 
had me flat on my back. True, in those "stagnation times" that 
have already become part of mythology, when Linh Van Nhan was a 
student at Voronezh University, Central Television was under the 
direction of Suslov, the country's chief ideologist. Naturally, 
all events involving our general secretary "for life" were 
presented as historic milestones. Whenever someone visited 
Moscow, "Vremya" expanded beyond any size. 
  For the Vietnamese press, television, and radio that are not 
infected with "Ostankino" syndrome, the main news is still 
closer to Vietnam. 
  For instance, much has been written about the visit to the 
Vietnamese capital of prominent French political figure Jacques 
Chirac. The mayor of Paris, who has his sights on the 
presidency, decided--as did current president Mitterrand--to 
build a solid bridge with the countries of Indochina, on the 
reasonable assumption that in the future they will take their 
proper place in the dynamically developing Asia-Pacific 
corridor. In conversation with the Vietnamese leadership, Chirac 
emphasized many times that France attaches priority significance 
to developing relations with Vietnam. And this is not a mere 
declaration. In terms of investment in the Vietnamese economy, 
France is third in the world after Hong Kong and Taiwan, and 
first in Europe. 
  One of the permanent foreign policy topics in the Vietnamese 
mass media is the host of American delegations that have 
descended on Vietnam. Congressmen, senators, and businessmen 
have begun to frequent it. Still, business rules politics, no 
matter how the latter may try to subordinate it. Representatives 
of IBM, General Motors, AT&amp;T, Kodak, and a number of other 
companies held consultations with Vietnamese Deputy Prime 
Minister Phan Van Khai as part of the research group of American 
industrialists and political scientists. 
  At a meeting with journalists, Ho The Lan, a representative 
of the SRV Ministry of Foreign Affairs press department, read 
out a long list of foreign delegations planning to visit 
Vietnam. There were no delegations from Russia and the CIS 
countries on that list. I have to admit that I am tired of 
repeating the reasoning regarding the potential benefits of 
cooperation with Vietnam. Therefore, today I will not do so. Let 
those Russian officials who visited Vietnam last year do it. 
They promised cooperation to the Vietnam side. And they were not 
the only ones. Prime Minister Chernomyrdin himself talked to 
Vietnamese Minister of Foreign Affairs Nguyen Manh Cam last fall 
in Moscow. It is hard to tell, though, how much these promises 
are worth. 
  But should we become like those Russian diplomats in Hanoi 
who, in a pique of temper, accused local journalists of not 
being objective in their coverage of Russian realities? 
  The discouraged Vietnamese colleagues, deprived of the 
propaganda materials they used to get from the now-abolished 
Hanoi bureau of RIA-NOVOSTI, are hurt by this allegation flung 
at them by the diplomats. 
  "Is what we publish about Russia or show on television not 
true?" one of the journalists asked me. 
  "Unfortunately, it is," I replied.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Trade With Russia Awaits Better </F>
Times"] 
  [Text] 1993 proved to be a difficult year for 
Russian-Pakistani economic relations. The volume of mutual trade 
between the two countries declined by about 40 percent for the 
year, and comprised only $40 million. 
  The main reason for the decline was the refusal of the 
Pakistani side to deliver goods to be credited toward the 
repayment of long-term state credits. The former Soviet Union 
granted these credits for the purchase of Soviet equipment for 
the metallurgical plant which was built with the technical 
assistance of the USSR on the shore of the Indian Ocean near 
Karachi. 
  A dispute arose over parity between the Russian ruble and 
the 
Pakistani rupee. Pakistan demanded--and, we might add, quite 
unexpectedly--that it be reviewed in the direction of increasing 
the "price" of the rupee. In fact this means a significant 
reduction in the debt obligations. In 1993, Pakistan should have 
delivered approximately $40 million worth of goods to Russia. 
However, it did not do so, and a foreign debt liability was 
formed for the first time. However, Russian economic experts 
working in the trade representation in Islamabad are not losing 
optimism. In their words, the problem of parity of currencies 
will be resolved and the indebtedness repaid in the nearest 
time, especially since the contracts for delivery of Pakistani 
goods for this sum have already been concluded. 
  Russia supplies a considerable amount of machine building 
products to Pakistan. These include textile looms, tractor 
assemblies, universal machine tools and instruments, electric 
motors, transformers, automatic machines, sheet metal, as well 
as cotton fabrics. Russia imports large quantities of ready-made 
clothing, tricot goods and linen from Pakistan, including men's 
shirts, shoes and sporting goods of various assortment. 
Pakistani sugar may also be of interest to us. 
  Russian and Pakistani experts believe that, despite the 
reduction in commodity exchange between the two countries, the 
prospects for economic cooperation of the two countries remain 
rather favorable. We are speaking primarily of the expansion of 
the metallurgical plant near Karachi from a capacity of 1.1 
million tonnes to 3 million tonnes. Russia has agreed to grant 
Pakistan a credit in the amount of $100 million. 
  The crowning touch in the successful cooperation of power 
producers may be the construction of a nuclear power plant. 
Islamabad has already appealed to Moscow with a request 
regarding its construction. However, as yet there has been no 
reply. At the same time, so as not to evoke the suspicions of 
the international community, Pakistan is preparing to place the 
future nuclear power plant under the control of the IAEA 
[International Atomic Energy Agency]. 
  Pakistan is also interested in acquiring Russian weapons. 
Experts cite primarily the MIG-29 and Su-27 combat aircraft, as 
well as tanks. There is talk of buying 300 tanks, with the 
subsequent development of tank-building capacities in the 
country. There is interest also in artillery weapons and 
submarines. However, many political and financial questions 
still remain unresolved up until the present time. Moreover, 
there is an actively operating pro-French and pro-Chinese lobby 
in Islamabad. The former is "pushing" primarily combat planes 
for Pakistan, and the latter--tanks. Russia has unexpectedly 
encountered competition in the Pakistani military market from 
the former Warsaw Pact member countries, and even from Ukraine. 
  The Russian trade representation in Islamabad sees a reserve 
for expanded economic cooperation with Pakistan and for the 
renewal of shipping of Pakistani cargo on vessels bearing the 
Russian flag. Previously, the USSR transported $70-80 million 
worth of cargo annually from Pakistan to Europe and back. Now 
Russian vessels are rare guests in the Pakistani ports.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Pepelyayev, candidate in juridical </F>
sciences: "Instability of Tax Legislation Inhibits Foreign 
Investors"] 
  [Text] The changes in the tax system and lack of 
coordination between the standards of tax legislation and the 
legislation on foreign investments are conditioning an arbitrary 
approach in the actions of the local tax inspections. The 
instructions of the Minfin [Ministry of Finance] and the 
Gosnalogsluzhba [State Tax Service] still do not facilitate any 
clarification of the situation. 
  Russian taxpayers learned the price of tax laws long ago. 
Any 
of their articles may be "interpreted" by the Gosnalogsluzhba or 
Minfin in such a way that the initially intended meaning is 
entirely lost. Some statutes may simply be ignored by the 
agencies of executive power. This has happened repeatedly. For 
example, this has been the case with the prohibition on making 
the standard tax statutes retroactive. 
  However, the edict issued on 27 September 1993 by the RF 
[Russian Federation] President, "On Improving Work With Foreign 
Investments," was believed immediately and evaluated as the 
issuance of a real legal guarantee for the effective 
implementation of capital investments. The edict specified that 
newly issued normative statutes regulating the conditions of 
functioning of foreign and joint enterprises on the territory of 
Russia shall not apply for a period of 3 years to enterprises 
which existed at the moment these statutes went into effect. 
  Taxation is one of the significant conditions for the 
functioning of enterprises, and the question of stability of the 
tax legislation is a particularly acute one. With the issuance 
of the edict, the problem, it would seem, has been resolved: On 
most of the territory of the former USSR, the possibility of 
planning activity several years in advance has once again 
emerged. Foreign companies and SP [joint ventures] have 
undertaken the compilation of long-term programs. However, once 
again the enterprises have been betrayed by their faith in the 
fact that the presidential edict is capable of withstanding the 
onslaught of departmental instructions. 
  In December of last year, routine changes were introduced 
into the tax system: The rates of a number of taxes were 
increased, the procedure for filing and payment of taxes was 
changed, and new payments were introduced. The foreign companies 
and joint ventures were not overly worried by this event, since 
they believed themselves (and many still do) protected against 
any unfavorable innovations in the tax sphere. However, as 
evidenced by numerous appeals by foreign companies and joint 
ventures, the local tax inspections maintain that the 3-year 
benefit on tax relations should not be applied, since "taxes are 
not related to the conditions of functioning of the 
enterprises." Since these statements bear a mass character, we 
may speak of an official position of the Gosnalogsluzhba and 
Minfin in regard to the edict, "On Improving Work With Foreign 
Investors." However, this time they have chosen the tactics of 
omission: In the letter of the Gosnalogsluzhba regarding the 
procedure for applying the new tax regulations, the 3-year 
benefit rule is absent. 
  Foreign and joint enterprises have been widely informed 
about 
the statutes of the edict and intend to make use of the benefits 
which it grants. Therefore, many of them continue to pay taxes 
at the old rates, refuse to pay the newly introduced taxes, etc. 
The local tax agencies are in a state of confusion. After all, 
they have not received any official written explanations in 
regard to the edict. However, if the tax agencies do not follow 
the statutes of the edict in the future and deem the application 
of the benefit to be illegal, then financial sanctions will be 
applied to the enterprises in a compulsory manner. The amounts 
of these sanctions are considerable, and therefore there is not 
much reason to hope that the foreign companies and joint 
ventures will quietly pay the fines and that the actions of the 
Russian tax agencies will not evoke a huge international 
repercussion. Which, of course, will have a negative effect on 
the process of investing funds into the Russian economy.

<F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Kvyatkovskaya, KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA </F>
correspondent: "Elected Somewhat Dishonestly..."] 
  [Text] The silence of the mass media on the subject of the 
past elections does not at all mean that the subject has been 
settled and that people are satisfied with the very peculiar 
Central Election Commission interpretation of the concept of 
democracy. Up to the present time, many of the candidates whose 
civic equality was infringed are attempting to defend their 
constitutional rights, legality, and justice with the help of 
the Procuracy in people's courts and the Constitutional Court. 
But the voters are supporting those who despaired, got tired, 
and understood the lack of promise of these efforts with 
sympathetic and stimulating telephone calls; they say, after 
all, we believed in you, and we participated in the elections 
only for your sake... 
  Popular wisdom says that a drop of water grinds a stone. 
And, 
apparently, the people in their wisdom are always correct. 
Because a miracle almost happened: In the end, the people's 
court in one election district declared the elections invalid. 
  This is a precedent, and it is worth discussing in greater 
detail. It seems that back on 9 March the Tyulkubas District 
commission for District No. 134 composed an act that declared 
the elections in the district invalid. It checked for two days 
the statement of candidate M. Mermankulov concerning a 
prejudiced attitude toward him on the part of precinct 
commissions in Kazgurtskiy Rayon and established that actually 
in their calculations the precinct commissions reduced the 
number of votes given to him in one case by 21, in another--by 
39, and in a third--by 17, etc. This was verified in a spot 
check with the opening of a package of ballots of a total of six 
precincts, and in all six similar "reductions" were permitted; 
moreover, not only were Mermankulov's votes reduced, but also 
those of all the other candidates from the six who were running, 
except for the deputy chief of the Kazgurtskiy Rayon 
administration, A. Kubeyev. 
  The district commission did not begin to confirm whether 
this 
was done intentionally or accidentally, considering this not to 
be in its jurisdiction. Therefore it limited itself only to the 
direct guidance of Article 65 of the Code on Elections, which 
concerns violations in vote counting--it declared the elections 
invalid. 
  It must be assumed that this decision did not come easily to 
the district commission. 
  From the information given by the district commission to the 
people's court: "In a spot check opening of packages of ballots, 
violations committed by precinct commissions in counting votes 
were disclosed. In six precincts the number of votes given to 
Mermankulov was artificially reduced almost by 180. Great doubt 
was also raised by the fact that almost one-third of the ballots 
were not folded in half before they were dropped into the ballot 
boxes. For this, it was necessary to conduct a special expert 
analysis. After discovering the indicated violations, the 
district commission approached the Central Election Commission 
for advice. A.I. Artamanov, secretary of the Central Election 
Commission, proposed displaying more independence. After this, 
the commission decided to declare the elections invalid and 
refused to sum up the voting in the entire district..." 
  It is a great pity that such a clear indication of civic 
courage becomes the property of the public only now, a month 
after the peak of the events. Otherwise we would have long ago 
been able somehow to get and publish the decree of the Central 
Election Commission of 15 March. This decree has historical 
significance for our young sovereign state, because it lays out 
the "theory of partial pregnancy." The voter, after all, is a 
crowd, a primitive mass, a woman can be pregnant or not 
pregnant, and elections can be honest or falsified. But 
according to the theory of the Central Election Commission, the 
tally of votes can be not quite honest, with massive 
falsifications, but at the same time not have an effect on the 
election results. How is this? Here is a quotation from the 
decree of the Central Election Commission: 
  "As the checkup showed, the precinct election commission 
committed technical errors in counting the votes with respect to 
all the candidates included on the voting ballot. However, they 
did not influence the outcome of the elections. 
  "The Central Election Commission decrees: 
  "1. To cancel the decree of the district election commission 
on the elections of deputies of the Supreme Council of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan for the Tyulkubas Election District No. 
134 'On Declaring the Elections Invalid.' 
  "2. To declare the elections in the Tyulkubas Election 
District No. 134 of the South-Kazakhstan Oblast valid. 
  "To instruct the district election commission to sum up the 
elections." 
  This long quote from the decree is given here especially so 
that our reader can catch the iron character of the Central 
Election Commission from its tone and style and its absolutely 
firm will. Its decrees regarding the legally unregistered 
candidates did not at one time distinguish themselves with such 
firmness, and were only in the nature of a recommendation. 
  But now once again from the report of the district 
commission 
to the people's court: "The district commission responded to all 
telephone instructions of the Central Election Commission to 
tally the votes with a refusal. Only after written instructions 
of the Central Election Commission of 15 March 1994, and under 
pressure from the supervisory workers of the oblast 
administration, did the district commission depart with its 
materials to Kazgurtskiy Rayon, where in fact the precinct 
commissions themselves were checking their own results of the 
voting, and it is very difficult to make a judgment about their 
objectivity. But it is on the basis of these results that the 
summing up was not conducted until 17 March 1994." 
  Is it worth commenting on anything in this quotation? No. 
After all, to the editorial staff the reader is not a primitive 
mass at all. He will understand everything even without a 
commentary. And he will reach his own conclusions. 
  We will only add a little information. The candidates whose 
rights were infringed upon have filed a complaint against the 
Central Election Commission with the soviet rayon people's court 
of the city of Almaty under the chairmanship of I. Baygesiyev, 
and the materials and circumstances of the elections in the 
134th District have been examined. Many facts were revealed 
indicating the ingenuity of the administration when it becomes 
necessary to resolve problems in its own interests. For example, 
elders came from the village of Sharankhan of Kazgurtskiy Rayon 
and talked about the great "concern" shown for the villagers 
during the elections. Just before the elections, members of the 
precinct commission came to their village, went to all the 
homes, and asked all the adults to sign lists of voters. At the 
same time, they did not offer to fill out ballots. And they 
explained that it would not be necessary to go to any elections 
after this... 
  I think that it was not easy for Judge I. Baygesiyev to 
reach 
a decision on the elections in the 134th Election District. 
However, could it have turned out any other way, given the 
aforementioned testimony of the elders? Even under the heaviest 
pressure? Probably not. Facts are a stubborn thing. 
  M. Mermankulov, who succeeded in making the first breach in 
the blind wall of lies and illegality, is a former author of 
KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA. He has written articles in the newspaper 
about the need to establish a single investigative committee, 
and he was and remains among those who are against corruption. I 
wanted to meet with him and congratulate him on his victory. But 
the meeting had to be postponed. After all, the decision of the 
court on the invalidity of the results of the elections in the 
134th District was adopted back on 5 April, but the Central 
Election Commission has still not uttered even a sound in this 
regard: It has not made a decision, it has not commented on the 
case for the press, and it has not disclosed its own profound 
feelings with respect to the falsifications. 
  Will the Central Election Commission suddenly ignore the 
whole Tyulkubas story as if it did not happen? As it has until 
now ignored many cases of violations of the law. We should 
obviously wait a little before congratulations.

<F P=106> [Dialogue between Sergey Volkov, editor of the analysis </F>
section of the newspaper ABV, and Mikhail Ustyugov, editor of 
the economics section of the newspaper EKSPRESS K: "It Seems the 
Asphalt Is Melting With the Last Snow. Whatever the Demand for 
Democracy--Such Will Be the Supply"] 
  [Text] [Volkov] Regardless of how much the subject of 
elections may set our teeth on edge recently, we will have to 
say something about them, summing up the March results. As 
predicted, voter activity turned out to be the lowest in recent 
decades. Although in terms of this indicator we are still 
probably "ahead of the rest of the planet," social apathy is 
clearly on the rise in Kazakhstan. But if in developed countries 
slow activity in the electoral precincts is explained by the 
lack of confidence in politicians as a class (they say that 
without them they could figure out their problems), in our 
country this phenomenon has a different subtext. Here the people 
are tired of political games and, the main thing, they do not 
believe in the possibility of stabilizing the situation with the 
help of new deputies. 
  The passivity of a certain part of the population has 
indirectly "supported" the executive power, which from the very 
beginning without beating around the bush has taken to slipping 
in (there is no other word for it) people it wants or finds 
helpful. Of course, such a policy could not fail to evoke 
hostility from certain voters who were already weary of 
mindlessly obeying the powers that be. 
  [Ustyugov] Here are some characteristic figures obtained as 
a 
result of a sociological poll conducted by workers of the 
Republic Center for Study of Public Opinion. People of 
Kazakhstan were asked which problems bother them most today. 
Two-thirds answered: the decline of the standard of living. And 
only one out of 20 mentioned the lack of democratic freedoms. 
Whatever the demand for freedom--such is the supply. As a 
result, we have been given elections that are conducted, as the 
president put it, according to Kazakhstan's standards of 
democracy. Who is to blame for the fact that they turned out to 
be quite unlike the Western ones? There is American democracy, 
there is the general European standard, there is the Chinese, 
the Chilean, and there is Kazakhstan's. And ours is probably far 
from the worst, even if it did baffle CSCE experts. In any case 
a good half of the deputies (not counting those elected through 
the state list) were elected, in my view, without any violations 
or juggling of figures. 
  As for the activity of the electorate, the answer is 
provided 
again by the figures from the poll of the Republic Center for 
Study of Public Opinion. Only 7.5 percent of those questioned 
are counting on effective activity from the new legislative 
organ, and the rest think that the members of parliament engage 
partially in talkathons and partially in lofty abstractions that 
have nothing directly to do with real life, which is ruled not 
by laws but by local bureaucrats. 
  I do not know whether the sociologists were interested in 
the 
reaction of Kazakhstan residents to a possible turn toward 
authoritarian power, with complete elimination of the 
legislative branch, but I do not think they would respond with 
any special disturbance or misgivings here either: The past four 
months, during which the president has had additional authority 
and published edicts instead of signing laws, have shown the 
"elasticity" of Kazakhstan's democratic standards and the fact 
that they are not ingrained in the very essence of the political 
system, social life, and mentality of the citizens. 
<H5>  The Fortress of Power and the `Degree' of Loyalty </H5>
  [Volkov] And still, in spite of the back-room games that 
have 
weeded out many politicians who were really needed in the 
Supreme Council, the new parliament will certainly not be in the 
government's pocket. 
  In the first place, certain deputies have remained from the 
preceding Supreme Council to join the current one, and the 
majority of them are extremely opposed to the policy being 
conducted today by the higher and middle echelons of power. 
  In the second place, no fewer if not more of the new members 
of parliament also share the aforementioned dislike for the 
actions of the government. 
  True, a part of the St. Petersburg corps is elected from the 
state or, more precisely, the president's list. Their position 
is unenviable. On the one hand, they were elected by the people 
and, quite naturally, must defend their interests. On the other, 
the fact that they were nominated by the head of state places on 
them certain moral (not to mention other) obligations to the 
president. This kind of duality (one might call it a "split 
personality") of a considerable number of the people's elect 
could undoubtedly play a self-destructive role in the new 
parliament. Add to this the division of the Supreme Council into 
two chambers (and many observers consider this all but a fait 
accompli) and it becomes clear that for the first time our 
deputies will be engaged in "slinging mud" at one another and 
the government at the same time. I think the former will still 
win out and the rest of the problems will be classified as 
internal parliamentary ones. 
  A distinguishing feature of March was the active preparation 
of certain people for posts in the Supreme Council. Today nobody 
any longer conceals the fact that Kuanysh Suyltanov should 
become the leader of one of the chambers of parliament. His 
conspicuous dismissal from the position of deputy prime minister 
because of "election to people's deputy" long before the 
beginning of the work of the first session was to have shown to 
the least quick-witted that this statesmen had now seriously 
taken up the cause of building a new parliament. 
  [Ustyugov] The main task of the "script writers" who today 
are preparing the basis for the first session is to provide for 
a structure of the legislative organ and a mechanism for its 
activity that will enable the executive power to function 
freely. Parliament is to play a constructive-decorative role and 
nothing more. Above all it will be necessary to undertake a 
number of organizational measures aimed at holding back, 
dragging out, and "self-entanglement" of decisions that run 
counter to government policy. The complicated bicameral 
structure, the system of relations between the two chambers, and 
the regulations work to this end. Many a week will probably be 
devoted to these questions. 
  Otherwise the standoff between the powers would begin almost 
on the first day of the session. And what good does it do that 
the amount of the minimum wage and pension in the republic is 
approaching the value of one U.S. dollar? They will call the 
prime minister to the podium and vote, say, for increasing the 
"minimum" to the value of the minimum consumer basket--400 
tenge. The citizens will rejoice. Tomorrow they will all be 
given 10 times more money. The day after tomorrow all the prices 
will rise 10-fold. Will they summon the prime minister to the 
podium again? 
  I am not speaking about the republic budget, from which all 
benefits for war veterans, misplaced residents of the Aral Sea 
area, Semipalatinsk victims, Chernobyl victims, and those who 
suffered from the repressions have been eliminated. What kind of 
parliament would approve such a decision? 
  There is only one way out: Raise the "degree" of 
parliamentary loyalty, which will make it possible to assign to 
the president additional authority (in any case in the economic 
sphere) throughout the entire period of the "transition." Then 
the government will have its hands tied and the people's 
deputies will have it easier: There will be no need to waver 
between the Scylla and Charybdis of schism and disbandment. 
<H5>  There Is More Room on Olympus </H5>
  [Volkov] The personnel changes that occurred in March again 
evoked more questions than answers. The "reassignment" of 
Tulegen Zhukeyev from the position of state adviser to the 
vacant post of deputy prime minister with the present 
leapfrogging in functional duties of members of the government 
make it impossible to understand whether this was a 
reinforcement of a "weak section" in the administration of the 
state or a demotion of some ill-favored person (recall how some 
of the functions were "taken away" from the former state 
adviser), or simply a change of the official title of the 
position held by Mr. Zhukeyev, leaving him in charge of all the 
sections he had before. The customary curtain of complete 
secrecy over transfers like this leaves no chance of figuring 
out the real reasons for the aforementioned actions. 
  Nor does the discharge of Marat Ospanov from the position of 
the republic's chief tax collector because of his election as a 
deputy a month before the beginning of the work of the 
parliament provide an answer to the question of whether this is 
related to his forthcoming active work in the new Supreme 
Council or if there are some other factors at work here. It is 
no accident, probably, that President Sergey Tereshchenko 
recently said reproachfully that last year the tax services of 
Kazakhstan collected only 42 percent of the taxes that were due. 
Such "kindness" to the taxpayers at a time that is so difficult 
for the state budget cannot but make one wonder. With respect 
for Mr. Ospanov as a politician I still cannot but ask what 
actually were the reasons for his desire to be among the 
people's deputies again and why the republic leaders supported 
him in this. This question could be asked of several of those 
who were elected in March. 
  [Ustyugov] I can add only that Zhukeyev's appointment as 
deputy prime minister, from the standpoint of the Basic Law, 
reinforces his positions since nothing is said about state 
advisers in the Constitution. I would not be surprised if the 
president eliminated the institution of state advisers 
altogether this year. 
<H5>  We Have Too Few Fedorovs but Too Many Zaveryukhas </H5>
  [Volkov] March was also very instructive in the area of our 
leaders' outside contacts. The tendencies here are such that the 
Almaty leaders have already come up with a universal 
"lamentation." Bouncing along the pothole-filled highways of the 
capital (the impression was that the asphalt would melt along 
with the last snow), they say: If the president had not 
travelled abroad so frequently and had traveled on our roads, 
things would be easier for us. Let us overlook the concreteness 
of this complaint-request and discuss the principle of its 
origin. It is very good that both Nursultan Nazarbayev and the 
country he heads have a positive image abroad. It is even better 
that considerable amounts of funds in dollars are allotted to 
this country. But beyond that, as in the Soviet Union in 
Gorbachev's times, everything practically comes to a standstill. 
How, why, and where this money is spent--we do not know. A fresh 
example. Having concluded an agreement with the IMF and having 
received a guarantee that Kazakhstan would receive a large 
foreign currency loan, our government stated repeatedly that the 
money would be spent, among other things, for stabilizing 
exchange rate of the tenge and curbing inflation. In March we 
could see quite well how these intentions are being realized 
when on the eve of the elections the dollar was surging upward 
and by April Fool's Day it had doubled its tenge value. And that 
was in one month! 
  If things continue like this it will not be long before it 
will be possible to have another financial reform in order to 
reduce the scale of the republic's monetary unit. Such fantasies 
are nourished by the appearance in circulation of bills worth 
200 tenge and the word from the president about his intention to 
buy from Great Britain special equipment on which our monetary 
bills are printed. If the former information evokes regret about 
such a rapid devaluation of the national currency (it is no joke 
that within four months after the monetary reform they will 
issue a denomination worth twice as much as the nominal value of 
the largest monetary bill!), the latter causes misgivings that 
soon the printing of tenge will turn into an uncontrolled 
process of issuing money that rapidly loses its value. 
  [Ustyugov] We do not have the appropriate political support 
for a stricter financial exchange rate in Kazakhstan. The 
Cabinet of Ministers is a monotonous, uniform monolith, and the 
struggle of approaches and concepts (if it exists at all) is 
left to the cadres. It is necessary to reveal (or create?) a 
multipolarity of government similar to the Russian: We must have 
our own Fedorovs who are ready to fall in battle against 
preferential credit and our own Zaveryukhas and Skokovs, who 
express the interests of the agro-industrial generals. But now 
one gets the impression that the government expresses only its 
own interests, which only it can understand, and therefore today 
it is capable of canceling out what it categorically declared 
yesterday, and tomorrow it will no less resolutely return to the 
other side. And all this without conflicts, polemics, or 
resignations, with concerted, inspired enthusiasm. The result is 
that the general deterioration of the situation (and it is 
inevitable this year) is linked by the citizens not to concrete 
officials representing various ideas and interests but the 
government and president as a whole. Today the head of state 
must distance himself from the Cabinet of Ministers--beginning 
with separation of the staffs and ending with the appointment to 
the position of prime minister of a really respected strategist. 
Instead of this, Nazarbayev takes the "fire" himself, signing 
first populist and economically ideologized and then 
monetaristic-draconian decisions. There is an ancient truth that 
the more you take on, the more they ask of you. Appeals to 
create global conferences and alliances with supernational 
kopeks sound good on world-scale spaces, but they do not solve 
our internal problems. 
<H5>  Do Not Grieve Over the Exchanges, Lads </H5>
  [Volkov] Kazakhstan is sometimes discussed in terms of a sad 
principle: Either something good or nothing at all. The decline 
of the production rates, the shutting down of hundreds of 
enterprises, and the nonpayments crisis have become typical 
phenomena. It would not be so bad if behind all this one could 
see positive tendencies in economic processes. Alas, even the 
documents the president and prime minister have signed, taking 
advantage of parliament's absence, give one no confidence that 
with their implementation our economy will reach any significant 
heights. Two recent edicts will serve as an example: "On 
Commodity Exchanges" and "On Measures for Forming Securities." 
Their adoption clearly shows that the country's leaders today 
are more interested in the problem of "staking out" as quickly 
as possible (before the beginning of the work of the Supreme 
Council) the basic points of their own economic policy than in 
actually implementing it. There has already been too much 
discussion of the sad fate of the Kazakhstan stock exchanges, 
which vanished not only because they were excessively numerous 
but also because of the fact that they were not included in the 
government schemes. So many lances, arrows, and other piercing 
writing implements have been broken over the creation of normal 
conditions for the formation of the securities market. Since it 
still does not exist, two legislative acts prepared by the 
executive power (another paradox of our legal thinking) will 
come out, and everyone is supposed to think that tomorrow 
everything will be okay in the corresponding areas of the 
economy. But in reality little will change as a result of the 
creation of state organs for questions of markets and securities 
(and these are the provisions that are the linchpins of these 
edicts), the more so taking into account the current degree of 
state influence over the economy. Why do these issues have to be 
raised again today? Is it really just in order to show that the 
executive power has its finger on the pulse of the reforms? 
  [Ustyugov] Incidentally, the government commission for 
developing the concept of the functioning of the securities 
market in Kazakhstan was created about two years ago and it 
seems that it has not convened once since then. Russia has 
adopted hundreds of normative acts aimed at the formation and 
civilized regulation of this extremely important variable in a 
market economy. We are just beginning. Well, we can still 
console ourselves: Better late than never.

<F P=106> [Article by Asylbek Abeldinov: "Amendments to the Law on </F>
Public Associations Are Required"] 
  [Text] More than 400 registered public associations 
operate in Kazakhstan. The majority of them have emerged in 
recent years. "Practice" requires the improvement of "theory": 
Lacunae in the legal base for the activity of parties, 
movements, associations, and such are obvious today. This is the 
subject of an article by Asylbek Abeldinov, member of the 
Central Election Commission of Kazakhstan and candidate of legal 
sciences. 
  A most important sphere of public relations connected with 
realization of the right of the citizens to association is 
regulated by the Law "On Public Associations in the Kazakh SSR," 
which was adopted on 27 June 1991. 
  But very appreciable changes have occurred in the recent 
period. A new statehood is taking shape, and the Constitution of 
the Republic of Kazakhstan has been adopted, which, in turn, 
requires current legislation to be brought into line with the 
provisions of the constitution and the development and detailing 
of constitutional provisions with regard to the requirements of 
current social practice. 
  A public-law mechanism of the realization of constitutional 
formulas should be created in order that on the one hand it 
really secure the rights and liberties of the citizen and, on 
the other, that the rights and liberties be realized inseparably 
from the obligations of the citizen, whose discharge is 
essential for the assurance of personal, public, and state 
interests. 
  In the context of what has been set forth there should, it 
would seem, be work done on the preparation of revisions and 
addenda to the legislation regulating the activity of public 
associations. It should be specified here that we are not 
talking only about the specific above-mentioned law. The 
problem, I believe, encompasses quite a wide range of 
legislative instruments. We have to raise the question of 
civil and economic and administrative and criminal legislation 
also. 
  A public association is an association of specific 
individuals which has arisen as the result of the 
voluntary, free, and conscious expression of the wishes of the 
citizens and which operates on the basis of the 
equality of its members, self-administration, legality, 
and glasnost. It should be added to this that an 
association is created on the basis of a community of 
interests of different individuals for the realization of their 
rights and liberties. The legal capacity of the public 
association as a legal entity arises only after the 
registration of its charter by an authorized official body 
in the procedure determined by legislation. 
  In other words, a salient feature of the institution in 
question is that it is uniquely "impregnated" with the ideas of 
legality, is based on the rights of man and citizen, and should 
constantly ensure observance of the obligations of both the 
public association and its members. None of these components 
should either fall by the wayside or be broken in the overall 
"chain" of activity of both the public association and each of 
its members in the composition of the latter. 
  But let us ponder: Are all these and other aspects connected 
with the functioning of the public associations regulated 
legislatively this scrupulously and in such broad envelopment. 
Perhaps not. Nor is this easy. 
  Account should be taken of the following aspects. 
  If a public association is a voluntary formation that has 
arisen as the result of the free expression of the wishes of the 
citizens united on the basis of a community of interests, then, 
logically, the citizens that are members of it delegate to 
the public association the right to control their behavior and 
actions in the name of the achievement of common goals and 
interests. Consequently, the purpose of the public 
association in this case is to ensure the formulation and 
determination of collective thought and collective actions 
within the framework of legality. 
  It is this "status" that should be stimulated by the 
official 
structures. I consider essential in this connection the 
development in current legislation of the provision enshrined in 
Article 53 of the constitution, according to which "the state 
ensures observance of the rights and legitimate interests of 
public associations." 
  But, as a study of the opinion of members of public 
associations shows, they do not always have a clear idea of what 
rights are accorded the public associations. 
  According to Article 18 (it is called "Rights of public 
associations") of the law on public associations, their rights 
are enshrined in their charters. At the same time, on the other 
hand, this cannot be understood in the literal meaning of the 
word. In other words, the charters should enshrine only rights 
clearly defined by the legislator. Which precisely? In 
accordance with the said article of the law (I quote verbatim): 
"For realization of the purposes and tasks determined in the 
charters, program documents, and other acts the public 
associations shall freely disseminate information concerning 
their purposes and activity and, in the instances and in the 
procedure specified by legislation, enjoy also the following 
rights: 
  "exercise legislative initiative in the person of their 
republic authorities (this right has become invalid inasmuch as 
it was not enshrined in the new constitution); 
  "represent and defend the legitimate interests of their 
members (participants) in state and public bodies; 
  "exercise other authority not conflicting with current 
legislation." 
  But other articles of the said law contain different rights 
also. Thus Article 19 specifies the right of public associations 
to create in the procedure established by law for the purpose of 
achievement of the statutory tasks enterprises and financially 
autonomous organizations possessing the rights of legal entity. 
Article 20 lists in detail what the public associations may own. 
Article 21 enshrines their right to establish press organs and 
engage in publishing activity in accordance with legislation of 
the republic. Article 26 establishes the right of public 
associations to maintain international relations. 
  The law lacks a precise definition of the obligations 
of public associations. I believe it would be expedient in 
the interests of the unambiguous understanding and application 
of the enshrined provisions to unite all that has been 
enumerated above, say, within the framework of one article 
entitled "Rights and obligations of public associations." 
  Certain provisions of Article 11 of the law on public 
associations (it is called "Membership of (participation in) 
public associations") require the corresponding amplification or 
adjustment. Specifically, the provision of this article to the 
effect that collective members (the work force of 
enterprises, institutions, and organizations and citizens' 
associations) may, in addition to political parties and trade 
unions, take part in the activity of public associations would 
seem contentious, in my view. 
  This provision is contrary, in my opinion, to the very 
essence of the public association inasmuch as it is created on 
the basis of the conscious expression of the wishes of specific 
individuals personally undertaking to comply with the 
requirements of the charter. The principle of the equality of 
the members of the association is violated also (what kind of 
equality can there be, you will agree, between the individual 
and the collective member). I cannot imagine what kind of 
"general" community of interests as a whole of the work force of 
this enterprise or institution or the other there could be. 
Especially if these are not political purposes and not 
professional interests (as we have already said, political 
parties and trade unions cannot by law have collective members). 
  One public association's collective membership of another 
gives rise to questions also. In this case, logically, the 
members and organs of administration of the first association 
should be guided in their activity by both their own charter and 
the charter of the association they have joined as a collective 
member. It transpires here that for some individual members 
there will be "dual" requirements, rights and obligations, and 
so forth, so to speak, for others, not. There is formally once 
again a violation of the principle of the equality of individual 
members. In addition, the constitutional principle of the 
equality of the legal possibilities of public associations is 
violated also. 
  But, as an analysis shows, there are many examples of public 
associations which have, indeed, registered in the procedure 
established by law uniting on a voluntary basis in unions of 
public associations. This is characteristic particularly of 
cultural and educational and artistic public associations. 
  This right of the public associations is specified by 
Article 
9 of the law. 
  But clarification is required here, in my view. Inasmuch as 
the citizens' associations creating the union have their own 
registered charters, they should unite in a union as subjects of 
the latter. In other words, a union (new formation) should not 
interfere in the intra-statutory activity of its subjects, 
should not decide questions of membership in them, and so forth 
inasmuch as it is not individual members of different public 
associations that are uniting in a new one but associations of 
citizens as a whole that are uniting for the joint achievement 
of the common purposes of different associations. 
  A union of associations does not have individual members 
directly: each association independently determines the 
procedure and conditions of membership in it and the rights and 
obligations of its members, that is, its "internal life." These 
clarifications should be made to the current law. 
  It has to be acknowledged that our legislation absolutely 
does not regulate the procedure or conditions of the formation 
and functioning on the territory of the republic of structural 
subdivisions of international public (nongovernment) 
associations and the public associations of other states. I 
would like to share my thoughts in this connection. 
  First. The head associations should be registered 
according to the whereabouts of their headquarters and, 
consequently, present to the authorized official body of 
Kazakhstan a copy of evidence (certificate) of registration of 
the charter (regulations) and the actual charter of this 
association certified in the established procedure. 
  Second. The purposes and tasks of the activity of 
this association must not conflict with the constitution or 
legislation of our state. 
  Third. An undertaking by the head of the 
diplomatic representation of the specific state to the effect 
that the activity of the structural subdivision of a public 
associations of this state will not be exercised to the 
detriment of the interests of the Republic of Kazakhstan is 
essential. 
  Fourth. A structural subdivision of such 
associations should have its own charter adopted and registered 
in our state in accordance with the legislation of the latter. 
  Fifth. Supervision of the activity of the 
structural subdivisions of such public associations should be 
exercised in accordance with the legislation of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan. 
  But the main condition I consider the following: The 
sponsors 
of the formation and leaders of the organs of administration of 
such structural subdivisions should be only citizens of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan, the right of citizens of other states to 
participate in the work of such organizations not being excluded 
here. 
  And how to determine the status of a public association: 
Will 
it be an international, republic, regional, or local association? 
  Things are today reaching the point of absurdity. If the 
sponsors of the creation of a public association want to 
register its charter with a declaration of its republic status, 
the statutory activity of the citizens' association must, as 
Article 7 of the law declares, extend even prior to registration 
of its charter to the territory of all or a majority of 
oblasts of the republic. 
  And according to Article 13, what is more, it is necessary 
within one month from the day that the charter is adopted (and 
the association is formed, consequently) to have submitted a 
declaration to the appropriate authorized official body with the 
enclosure of material confirming the territory of dissemination 
of the activity of the association and other material necessary 
for registration of the charter. 
  This "severity" of legislative prescription hardly 
corresponds to the interests of the cause or a strengthening of 
legality in the activity of the public associations. 
  Which is what I would like to propose. 
  The authorized official body registering the charter of a 
public association should, evidently, determine the specific 
timeframe within which the association, after registration 
of its charter, is required to present to this body documents on 
the creation of its structural subdivisions on the 
territory of the corresponding oblasts and their registration in 
the procedure established by law. In the event of noncompliance 
with this condition, the same official body should cancel its 
decision on registration of the charter. 
  The soundness of the current practice, when one and the same 
body, the Ministry of Justice, for example, undertakes the 
preliminary consultation on questions of the formation of public 
associations and itself performs the registration, would seem 
contentious, in my view. It would be more expedient for these to 
be different bodies. Some should hold the consultations, say, 
others, undertake the official registration of the charters of 
public associations. A practice has taken shape currently 
whereby the same specialists render advisory assistance and 
present the findings in respect to the documents for 
registration of the charters prepared on the basis of their 
advice. 
  It would be expedient for the activity of political parties 
to be regulated by a special law. The point being that the 
current law on public associations determines merely the 
procedure and conditions of formation and also membership of 
political parties. I believe that this is insufficient inasmuch 
as the law should not only prohibit or authorize but regulate 
specific activity and adjust particular legal relationships. 
  I would believe expedient in this connection the adoption of 
a public associations code with the inclusion in it of the laws 
on public associations, on freedom of religion and religious 
associations, and on the trade unions, which have already been 
adopted and which are operating, and also the proposed new law 
on political parties.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Verk: "RKTRK--...There Is No Alternative"] </F>
  [Text] A Japanese sociologist once said: "With the 
development of television, Japan will be transformed into a 
country of 100 million fools." In our Homeland the situation is 
much better--at least the population and its growth rates give 
us hope: The fate of the Japanese does not threaten us. 
  The president's edict of 5 April "On the Creation of the 
Republic Corporation 'Television and Radio of Kazakhstan' 
[RKTRK]" was a surprise to those in the know. The fact is that 
the former State Television and Radio Company Kazakhstan, in the 
hands of its chairman Sherkhan Murtaza, has long held its 
rightful place in the country's information space, properly 
performing its role as a mouthpiece for state policy. And the 
proposed rules of the game were unquestioningly accepted on the 
other side of the screen: The majority of Kazakhstan television 
viewers took advantage of the services of commercial television 
channels, tuning in to State TV only in extraordinary situations 
(the introduction of the national currency, price increases, 
earthquakes, etc.). 
  Recently a certain amount of excitement among the viewers 
was 
caused by the election of Mr. Murtaza to the professional 
parliament, in connection with which the candidacy of his 
successor was actively discussed. But in fact everything turned 
out not to be so simple. Even from the first point of the 
president's edict it follows that the upstart "telemonster" will 
dominate the republic air waves, since it is being created "as a 
part of the State Television and Radio Company Kazakhstan, and 
also other enterprises and organizations included in it on a 
voluntary basis." According to certain preliminary information, 
TAN and KTK [expansions not indicated] intend to merge with 
RKTRK (nothing is known so far about the other commercial 
channels). Be that as it may, it is TAN and KTK that are the 
most popular among television viewers of the capital today. And 
if the "statization" of the former is not especially surprising, 
taking into account the appointment to Murtaza's position of the 
former TAN chief, Leyla Beketova-Khrapunova, the mooring at that 
same dock of the ship of Mr. Fidel looks somewhat strange. In a 
word, in a country where the three branches of power do not 
always manage to separate themselves from one another, this kind 
of symbiosis within the fourth should come as no surprise. 
  And, judging from certain nuances, they did not come up with 
this alliance just yesterday. According to unverified 
information from sources close to the leadership of the former 
Gosteleradio, the draft of the aforementioned edict was prepared 
at the end of last year. And after the official electronic 
press, precisely in keeping with the scenario, won the role 
allotted to it in the election campaign, the document was 
blessed with the president's signature. 
  Observers regard this innovation as another step to the 
achievement of the cherished dream of domestic authorities: 
agreement of opinion that is "democratic" in form and 
authoritarian (at best) in content. If in addition to all this 
they manage to realize the age-old plan of the "higher-ups," to 
organize Russian-language broadcasting on the Russian channel, 
the television viewers will very soon be able to see the irony 
of the well-known commercial: With all the wealth of choice 
there is no alternative...

<F P=106> [Article by D. Kurbanov: "The New Railroads of Turkmenia"] </F>
  [Text] In connection with the plans to develop 
Turkmenia, the railroad workers of this state have been faced 
with the task of further rebuilding existing lines and 
constructing new ones. 
  The interests, let us say, of the Balkan Velayat -- a region 
with tremendous reserves of oil, salt, iodine, bromine and hard 
coal --require an exit, not only to the center of the country, 
but also to the north. It is planned to run new branch lines 
from Gazandzhyk (Kazandzhyk) to the open-pit mines of Gyzylgaya 
(Kyzylkaya) (about 150 kilometers) and from Krasnovodsk (now the 
city of Turkmenbashi) to the salt developments. 
  A mainline track to the Turkmen subtropics has already been 
laid from the Gazandzhyk Station to the south. This is needed 
for development of Turkmenistan's agriculture. Several harvests 
a year may be obtained here with an approach to the subtropic 
area of the Amu-Darya waters along the Karakum Canal (this 
project is already being carried out successfully). On the other 
hand, the branch line from Gazandzhyk to the border settlement 
of Gyzylatrek (Kyzylatrek), over 300 kilometers long, will be an 
alternative, a second link of the Trans-Asian mainline, with an 
exit to Iran and Turkey. In this case, about 80 kilometers of 
rails remain to be laid from the Turkmen border to the closest 
station in Iran. 
  To the northeast of Turkmenistan, the Dashkhovuz (Gashauz) 
Station will be further developed and will become the country's 
major new railroad junction. The Dashkhovuz Velayat is a major 
producer of agricultural goods: grain, rice, cotton, sesame, raw 
silk and karakul sheep. Last year alone the supply of fresh 
vegetables from Dashkhovuz by the inhabitants of Ashgabat made 
it possible to reduce the urgency of the "vitamin" problem 
several-fold. Motor vehicle transport between the north and the 
capital of the republic, however, is expensive. The prices for 
Dashkhovuz tomatoes and cabbage are very high. 
  A branch line is now being constructed in Dashkhovuz from 
the 
Koneurgench Station to the small town of Kerney. It is possible 
that a mainline by-passing the Uzbek territory will soon have to 
be built from the Dashkhovuz Station, since this section, up to 
the junction station of Gazochag (Gazochak), for the time being 
has strained relations with the Central Asian section -- 
primarily because of disputes about the engineering shoulders 
for locomotive traffic and about safeguarding freight. 
  It is planned to run another branch along the left bank of 
the Amu-Darya from Chardzhev (Chardzhou) to Kerki, along the 
motor-railroad bridge to the Amu-Darya Station. The 
communicating road is now cut off from the area of medium flow 
of the Amu-Darya. Thanks to the new branch line, it will become 
faster and more reasonable to transport sulfur, potassium salt, 
marble, cotton and grain from the southeastern raw materials 
"corner" to the center of the country. 
  Large reserves of valuable raw material have been discovered 
in the eastern, Lebap Velayat. The future mainline from 
Chardzhev to Kerki must therefore be linked up with the 
presently operating branch line from Mary to Gushga (Kushka). 
This "ring" will make it possible for Turkmenistan to exit 
through Afghanistan and Pakistan to ports on the Indian Ocean 
and the Persian Gulf. 
  To a certain extent, all these plans are being implemented 
today. Dozens of kilometers have already been laid in all 
directions. Work on laying a road to the border town of Sarakhs 
is particularly intensive: almost the entire 120-kilometer 
roadbed and 50 kilometers of mainline tracks have been 
constructed. The road is, of course, experiencing a shortage of 
rails and ties, and does not have enough construction equipment, 
but things are moving. The outlines of a developed transport 
structure for Turkmenia are gradually appearing.

<F P=106> [Article by Vasiliy Shchurov: "Without Rudder and Sails; </F>
When Will There be a Program for Agrarian Reform"] 
  [Text] A document expected for a long time and even 
with impatience fell into my hands a few days ago. The Ministry 
of Agriculture has submitted the draft Program of agrarian 
reform, which has been going on for three years already, to the 
Committee on Agricultural Policy of the Federation Council. 
  The committee has invited to its parliamentary hearings 
forces which usually associate with one another in the language 
of ultimatums. It was intended to impartially listen to members 
of the government, deputies of the agrarian faction of the Duma, 
leaders of the "free farmers" and the "red landlords" and, 
having evaluated the positions of the parties, to decide where 
and how to further move the agrarian reform forward. However, as 
should have been anticipated, the proximity in the hall of the 
ideological opponents did not at all bring them together. 
  Representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture and the 
Russian Federation Committee on Land Resources and Land 
Management summed up the results of three years of reform. They 
produce a great impression in the sphere of the redistribution 
of "no man's property." Thus, 95 percent of the agricultural 
lands have found owners--collective and private. Moreover, the 
former have remained in the minority: only 34 percent of the 
kolkhozes and sovkhozes have maintained their status. Most of 
the land and property has been divided on shares among the 
members of joint-stock companies and associations 
(tovarishchestvo) and transferred free of charge to individual 
farmers, horticulturists and gardeners. That is, a mixed 
economic system has already returned to the village. Which, 
according to theory, presumes the competition of the producers 
and reasonable sustenance for you and I as a result. 
  In practice, however, there hasn't been an increase in 
produce from the redistribution of the kolkhozes. The production 
of plant-growing products continues to decrease, although at a 
slower rate than in industry. During the three years farms have 
lost 15-20 percent of the cattle stock, which has slipped to the 
level of the '60s and '70s. In comparison with the 
pre-perestroyka period, deliveries of trucks to the village have 
dropped by a factor of five and those of combines and tractors 
by a factor of almost two. Last year arable land received two 
times less fertilizers than required, i.e., the land is losing 
fertility and we are squandering the grandchildren's 
property. 
  The parties (storona) have not found a common answer to the 
question that is traditional in such a situation--"Who is 
guilty?" The representatives of the agrarian faction of the Duma 
have traditionally accused the reformers of the breakdown of the 
kolkhozes and the hurried spreading of individual farming. No 
less traditionally the representatives of the government have 
alluded to the errors of the previous Cabinet of Ministers, 
which fought against inflation at the expense of reducing state 
support of the village, and did not restrain the monopolists 
whose output increased in price three to five times more rapidly 
than grain, milk and meat. As a result both strong kolkhozes and 
individual farmers have found themselves bankrupt. 
  There was even greater discord in forecasts. The academic 
secretary of the Russian Agricultural Academy, Anatoliy Shutkov, 
has predicted a 10 percent reduction in production this year and 
transformation of Russia into a raw material appendage of the 
West in the near future. Deputy Vasiliy Starodubtsev has stated 
that 30 million tonnes of grain less than usual will be gathered 
and that production on individual farms will drop by 15 percent. 
The head of the Ministry of Agriculture, Viktor Khlystun, on the 
contrary, has stated that in the next few months not only will 
one manage to stop the fall but also to gradually raise 
production. Having made the proviso, it's true, that to do this 
it is necessary to implement the decree on financial support of 
the agricultural industry and to adopt the Program of agrarian 
reform prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture. 
  Don't confuse this document with the not unknown food 
program. And not just because it is being proposed to raise the 
village this time by market measures--demonopolization of 
enterprises, privatization of processing, of land... In this 
draft of the Program of agrarian reform, which is designed for 
two years, there is not even a hint of a limit with respect to 
the harvests, milk yields, or volumes of construction which it 
is necessary to reach. The question is one of the general 
principles and directions of the development of the 
agro-industrial complex and a policy of state protectionism. 
  There are measures in the program long since promised 
and long since expected in the village. Let's say, the proposal 
to introduce state regulation of the prices for the products of 
monopolist enterprises and for the peasants--guaranteed purchase 
prices for basic products. Or the introduction of a single land 
tax instead of the innumerable assessments which now fleece the 
producers and in no way stimulate the efficient utilization of 
the land. Or the abandonment of the subsidization of food 
imports with the simultaneous repeal of all restrictions on the 
export of our own agricultural products. The question is when 
these measures will move from the sphere of drafts to real 
life. 
  It's to the point to remember that this version is the sixth 
in succession. The previous five drafts have been buried in an 
abyss of corrections and coordinations. We have already paid 
dearly for attempts to reform the village without thinking, by 
means of one-time decrees and edicts. Tatyana Vasilyeva, an 
independent farmer from Krasnodar Kray, has said frankly that 
privatization has become pilferage and has proposed the adoption 
of a law by which one would be able to confiscate land from 
false independent farmers, of whom there are any number. It is 
no easier to correct the mistakes with the hasty privatization 
of processing enterprises built by kolkhoz and sovkhoz money. It 
is noted in the draft Program that the controlling bloc of 
shares in this case is to belong to the producers. However, time 
has been lost--many creameries and meat-packing plants have been 
privatized by city-dwellers and are dictating their own terms to 
the village... 
  The program was prepared in today's version as long ago as 
last year, but because of the obstinancy of the Ministry of 
Finance and the Ministry of Economics simply hasn't attained 
approval. According to Viktor Khlystun the intention is to 
consider the draft in the presidium of the government only in 
April. The Duma and the Federation Council will examine the 
document later still, and later still both houses must adopt a 
group of laws in elaboration... Given the polarity of the 
viewpoints towards reform on the part of the executive and 
legislative power there is no guarantee at all that the concept 
of agrarian reform will be legitimized in the next few months. 
  Well, what of it you say? We lived three years without a 
program and we'll live some more. Perhaps so. Only in this case

<F P=106> [Article by Academician V. Boyev, director of the </F>
All-Russian Scientific Research Agricultural Economics 
Institute: "Why Aren't the Reforms Working?"] 
  [Text] The profound crisis which is continuing in the 
agrarian sector is forcing many to think seriously about why the 
reforms being carried out in this sphere are not achieving their 
transforming purpose. What is the opinion on this score of 
agrarian scientists, first of all those who deal directly with 
problems of the reformation of economic relations in the 
village? Our correspondent, G. Vasilyev, has asked Academician 
of the Russian Agricultural Academy and Director of the 
All-Russian Scientific Research Agricultural Economics 
Institute, V. Boyev, to share them. 
  Serious tactical errors in conducting it were committed from 
the very beginning of the agrarian reform. In particular, this 
applies to the priorities chosen, including the support of 
entrepreneurship in the form of trader middlemen ahead of 
agricultural producers, private and petty forms of farm 
management ahead of large-scale, premature orientation on world 
prices to the detriment of the parity of prices for agricultural 
and industrial products. 
  Disparagement of the role of state regulation has had an 
especially negative effect on matters in the agro-industrial 
complex. This has been the consequence of treating it like the 
forms of administrative influence on production, which is 
incompatible with market relationships. 
  Of course, the market, by its very nature, is a 
self-regulating system in many respects. However, it not only 
doesn't exclude but even presumes the need for state 
interference in order for it to invariably work for the 
strengthening and growth of the economy. Such an approach to the 
agro-industrial complex is determined by a number of objective 
reasons. Among them is the diversity of natural and climatic 
conditions in our country, given which it is important to create 
a system for protecting agricultural commodity producers and for 
insuring their activity. There is also the instability of prices 
and revenues in the agro-industrial complex, which depend both 
on natural factors and on market conditions. Moreover, a low 
degree of monopolization in agriculture and a high degree in the 
resource-supplying and service spheres is characteristic for 
Russia. 
  The advisability of regulating the agro-industrial complex 
is 
confirmed also by the experience of countries with a market 
economy. Thus, in the USA, despite agriculture's high 
technological level, the state pays price subsidies to the 
farmers, monitors the maintenance of price parity, and finances 
the development of agricultural science and the social 
infrastructure from the federal budget. Programs for the 
construction of roads and social infrastructure facilties in 
rural localities are implemented through the budgets of the 
states and municipalities. The activity of state services in the 
USA is directed to the creation of favorable conditions for the 
market management of agriculture and at the same time it permits 
the maintenance of an economically and socially acceptable level 
of prices for food and other commodities. 
  Regulation of the agrarian sector in the countries of the 
EEC 
and other states is organized in a similar manner. Their 
experience attests to the fact that, as market relations 
develop, state regulation of the national economy not only 
doesn't lose its significance but, on the contrary, becomes more 
complicated and is perfected. Rejection of it would mean 
rejection of the state itself. 
  However, the market is to be combined not with any means of 
external influence. As conversion to it proceeds, fundamentally 
new methods of regulation must become predominant. Among them 
one should single out the program method. It means the 
combination of mechanisms for the self-regulation of the 
agricultural market with the development and implementation of 
programs for the functioning of the market and the development 
of the agro-industrial complex. The "planning-programming-budget 
development" system introduced in the USA in the '60s can serve 
as an example of such regulation. Planning was interpreted in 
this case to mean determination of the long-range goals and of 
the ways to achieve them. An average period program for its 
achievement was developed for each of the goals. Budgets (annual 
plans of activity, determination of revenue sources and the 
distribution of resources) were calulated on the basis of the 
programs. 
  Analogous systems operate with well-defined information in 
Japan, Korea and other countries. This is especially 
characteristic for the stages of the fundamental structural 
reorganization of the economy. Objectively, such a process is 
also inevitable for Russia. 
  At the same time the villagers expect from the state a 
price, 
finance and credit, and tax policy which would promote the 
stabilization and development of agrarian production. Today we 
observe the reverse image. The liberalization of prices, begun 
in 1992, has led to the drastic deterioration of the economic 
situation in the agrarian sector. This has occurred to no small 
degree because of the monopoly position of the enterprises which 
procure agricultural products and produce material-technical 
assets for the village. The gap in the growth rates of prices 
for industrial and agricultural products in 1993 has increased 
to more than twice the 1990 level as a result. 
  One of the reasons for the ineffectiveness of price policy 
is 
the imperfection of the system being used for monitoring price 
parity. The result is the lack of an efficient system for 
restoring it. The entire tracking system comes down to the 
indexation of prices (more or less reliable and not always 
timely) and on this basis--to the subsidizing of the production 
of specific types of products. Forecasting of the price 
situation is essentially not being done. Hence the persistent 
miscalculations not only at the lowest but also at the highest 
level of the regulation of price relationships. 
  In our opinion, it is important for the balanced development 
of the agro-industrial complex to achieve day-to-day tracking of 
the movement of prices for industrial goods and the products of 
agriculture and the processing industry, and of retail prices at 
the republic, regional, and local levels. As far as the 
monopolist enterprises of the resource-supplying sectors are 
concerned, then it is advisable to set maximum (predelnyy) 
prices for them and to adjust them periodically, taking the 
increase in the cost of energy resources and the inflationary 
growth of wages, as well as changes in tax and credit policy, 
into account. 
  Under conditions of the absence of competition, the measure 
being proposed appears warranted. Of course, the situation when 
a price is established on the basis of free competition and 
neither an enterprise nor the state is able to increase or to 
reduce a price established on the basis of supply and demand is 
the best. If a commodity producer and wholesale and retail trade 
are in a position to arbitrarily increase a price, this is a 
sign not of market, but what is contrary to it, of the monopoly 
price-setting that we now observe. 
  As a result the villager is not able to purchase 
agricultural 
machinery and to acquire even the necessary minimum of mineral 
fertilizers and other supplies. Such a situation has resulted in 
the significant growth in the labor intensity of the production 
operations being performed and in the prolongatiion of the 
periods for field work and in a great shortage of products. 
  Serious errors have also been committed in financial policy. 
The existing system of state support is ineffective so far. It 
has not resolved the problems of stabilizing production, 
increasing the interest of commodity producers in augmenting 
food and raw material production and investment activity, and 
improving living conditions. The necessary stimuli for 
structural changes in the agro-industrial complex also have not 
been created. This is one of the reasons for the proposals 
recently advanced about the drastic curtailment or even 
termination of the financing of the agrarian sector, which would 
result in an even greater fall in agricultural production. As 
practice demonstrates, it is essential, especially in the period 
of the transition to the market, to strengthen financial support 
as one of the forms of state regulation of the agro-industrial 
complex and to impart to it a systems, goal-directed, and 
stimulating character. At the present time it should be linked, 
first of all, with overcoming the deficit of agricultural 
products and made available chiefly to those who guarantee the 
maintenance and, in the long run, the growth of production. 
  The tax policy being followed also is not up to the tasks of 
stabilizing and developing the food market. Many of the taxes in 
use do not create an interest in expanding agricultural 
production and strengthening the village's material-technical 
base. They are very burdensome for the peasants. That is why it 
is advisable in their interests and those of the consumers of 
agricultural products to decrease the weight of taxation. With 
this aim in view it would be proper, at least for the period of 
the formation of market relationships, to revoke the tax on the 
profit of agricultural enterprises regardless of the structure 
of the products and services being sold, and to approach the 
setting of transfers to the employment fund differentially, by 
not imposing them on farms experiencing a personnel shortage. 
  Exemption from the tax on the profit of agricultural, 
agroservice, and processing enterprises which goes for 
reinvestment (capital investments, reconstruction, technical 
retooling of production), as well as for the development of the 
social sphere, will help improve matters in the agro-industrial 
complex. In order to interest the manufacturer of products for 
the village in selling their goods at prices no higher than the 
maximum (fixed), one should set a differentiated percentage of 
reduction of the rate of the profit tax depending on the 
physical volumes of production achieved. It is advisable to set 
a maximum profit rate, and to not impose a tax on the profit 
received, for new, highly efficient products over a period of 
two to three years from the moment of their being put into 
series production. 
  The granting of privileges to enterprises and organizations 
of other branches of the national economy who direct a portion 
of profit to the development of the agro-industrial complex 
would yield a considerable effect. This would help increase the 
inflow of capital into this sphere. There are also other 
suggestions with respect to rational taxation. They all are 
directed to creating favorable conditions for developing the 
agro-industrial complex and stabilizing the food market. 
Government regulation on the basis of well thought-out and 
effective utilization of price, financial, credit, tax, and 
other economic control levers should be subordinated precisely 
to this.

<H5>  Prices of Consumer Goods and Services </H5>
  Over the period 5 through 15 March 1994 a growth of 2.4 
percent was observed in the prices of consumer goods and 
services, including a growth of 1.7 percent for food products. 
Food products in cities of the Northern Caucasus and Eastern 
Siberia experienced the greatest price increases (2.7-3.1 
percent), while virtually no change was seen in food product 
prices in cities of Western Siberia, the Urals, and Central 
Chernozem. The rate of growth of prices for nonfood products was 
3.1 percent, for services--3.5 percent. 
  The following table shows price indexes for goods and 
services in the consumer market (as a percentage of the previous 
date):

products--by 3.2 percent (36.7 percent), nonfood products--by 
4.7 percent (29.5 percent), and services to the populace--by 8.5 
percent (2.2-fold). 
  Foodstuffs. Over the period 5 through 15 March,

  In organized trade from 5 through 15 March, frozen fish, 
milk 
and dairy products, and certain varieties of cereal and macaroni 
products increased 3-5 percent in price; salt, fresh cabbage, 
and carrots increased 6-8 percent. Prices for vegetable oil, 
meat products, and sugar stood virtually unchanged. 
  In nonorganized trade, as in organized trade, the largest 
increase in prices was recorded for vegetables and fowl (4-9 
percent). Prices for dairy products virtually remained at their 
previous level. The average price of oranges dropped 4 percent. 
  The cost of a selection of 19 basic food products rose 1.8 
percent over the week, amounting to 43,000 rubles [R] per month 
as of 15 March. The differentiation factor between observed 
cities was 3.6. St. Petersburg and Moscow rank 35th and 36th out 
of 132 observed cities with respect to cost of the selection 
(R47,020 and R46,960 per month). 
  Nonfood products. Over the period 5 through 15 
March, the greatest price increases were observed for fabrics 
and medicinal preparations (4.7-6.2 percent), and garments and 
knitted articles (2.8-3.4 percent). Prices for footwear rose 1.8 
percent, tobacco products--1.6 percent. 
  Paid services to the populace. During the period 
of observation, the trend towards galloping rates for municipal 
and domestic services continued. Payment per square meter of 
municipal living space and for hot water rose by 34 percent on 
the average across Russia. A manyfold increase was seen in the 
level of payment in Vorkuta, Ukhta, Norilsk, Krasnoyarsk, 
Barnaul, Kamyshin, and Voronezh. Rates increased 5-8 percent for 
certain varieties of everyday services (shoe repair, barber 
services, baths, and a number of other services). 
<H5>  Costs of Producers of Industrial Production Output </H5>
  The index of wholesale prices for producers of industrial 
output was lower in February than in January, amounting to 116 
percent. Prices increased 37 percent over the first two months 
of this year (as compared with December 1993). The following 
table characterizes changes in wholesale prices in February for 
sectors of industry:

  The rate of growth of prices was lower in February than in 
January in practically all sectors of industry (except in 
ferrous metallurgy, the petrochemical industry, and light 
industry). At the same time, high rates of price growth were 
continued for fuel industry output. Prices for oil increased 28 
percent in February, natural gas--24 percent, oil products--19 
percent, and coal--9 percent. As of 28 February, the average 
price of coal was R13,000 per tonne, oil--R52,000, gas--R3,200 
per thousand cubic meters, gasoline--R143,000, and diesel 
fuel--R132,000 per tonne. 
  The increased prices for energy resources and their 
byproducts continued to exert an influence on the cost of 
electric power. Electric power rates increased 1.3-1.4-fold over 
the January-February period. As of 28 February, the cost of one 
kilowatt-hour of electric power came to about R25 on the average 
for all categories of consumers. 
  In the machine-building sectors in February, the most 
significant price increases were observed in the output of 
tractor and agricultural machine-building (by 41 percent on the 
average), railroad, mining, and ore-mining machine-building (by 
27 percent), and the bearing and bushing industry (by 29 
percent). 
  The price index was 116 percent for light industry--4 
percentage points higher than in January, primarily due to the 
large price increases for cotton and flax fabrics, rugs and 
carpets, leather goods, sportswear, and certain other items. 
  The price increase for food industry output in February was 
12 percent (15 percent in January). The price rise was within 
the limits of 10-15 percent for basic food products--bread and 
bakery products, meat products, fats and oils; 18-20 percent for 
dairy products and butter. No change was observed in the prices 
of sugar and certain varieties of canned fruits and vegetables. 
  On the whole, the increase in prices was lower for consumer 
goods over the two months than for technical production output. 
These indexes were 28 and 40 percent, respectively. 
  Acquisition costs. The increase in costs, February 
over January, for basic varieties of material-technical 
resources acquired by industrial enterprises was 13 percent, 
including 12 percent--from suppliers in Russia, 22 percent--from 
CIS member states, and 16 percent--from countries of the far 
abroad. Over the first two months of this year, prices for the 
material-technical resources acquired by industry increased 34 
percent. 
  Costs for the acquisition of fuel resources rose by 13 
percent over the month, including for oil--by 19 percent, 
natural gas--by 14 percent, furnace fuel oil and diesel fuel--by 
15-18 percent. Enterprises of the oil processing industry 
procured oil at the price of R80,000 per tonne on the average in 
February (production cost--R52,000). The cost of natural gas 
used in the electric power industry came to R32,000 per thousand 
cubic meters on the average (production cost--R3,200); the 
average cost of energy-producing coal was R19,000, and coking 
coal--R50,000 per tonne, while the production cost of coal was 
R13,000. 
  The price index for sale of livestock production output by 
procurement organizations in February of this year was lower 
than the January level and amounted to 112 percent. The average 
price (not taking subsidies into account) of one kilogram of 
livestock and fowl (live weight) in Russia was R773; a liter of 
milk--R145; 10 eggs--R688. Prices increased 29 percent over the 
two months (as compared to December 1993). 
  The seasonal reduction in milk purchases was followed by a 
high rate of price increase with respect to milk sales in 
January-February (16-18 percent). Prices for livestock, fowl, 
and eggs increased 9-10 percent in February. 
  Costs for the producers of agricultural output rose 10 
percent in February, 28 percent--since the beginning of the 
year. This includes an increase of 27-38 percent for machinery 
and equipment used in plant-growing and livestock-breeding, 
trucks, and mixed fodders, and an increase of 46-51 percent for 
mineral fertilizers and electric power. 
  Costs in capital construction. Actual costs for 
capital investments rose 17 percent in February of this year 
over the previous month's levels; for construction and 
installation work--12 percent. The increases over levels of 
December of last year were 46 and 50 percent, respectively. 
  The rise in cost of building materials was more significant. 
Over the month, prices for materials acquired by contractor 
construction organizations increased by 26 percent. The increase 
was 51 percent since the beginning of the year. The costs of 
enterprises that produce building materials increased by 16 and 
40 percent, respectively. 
  The following table shows price indexes for the acquisition 
of main groupings of building materials:

  One of the basic reasons for the galloping price increases 
in 
acquisition of certain varieties of materials is the swift rise 
in cost of transportation, supply, and sales services. In 
February of this year, their share came to 14 percent of the 
acquisition costs on the average for basic types of materials, 
for crushed stone and gravel--about 50 percent; their share of 
the acquisition costs for cement, asphalt-concrete mix, 
asbestos-cement sheeting, and construction brick was over 15 
percent. 
<H5>  Industrial Production </H5>
  Over the first 13 days of March 1994, of 163 production 
varieties taken into consideration for periodic reporting, the 
average daily production volume as compared with the same period 
of March 1993: 
  --increased for 16 entries, or 10 percent of the 
total (including city telephone network cable, polypropylene, 
movie film, magnetic tape, cotton fabrics, knitting machines, 
school notebooks, pencils, fatty cheeses and feta cheese, toilet 
soap, filter and nonfilter cigarettes, and shaving cream); 
  --decreased for 142 entries, or 87 percent of the 
total. 
  As compared to the same period of February 1994, this 
average 
daily production volume: 
  --increased for 54 entries, or 33 percent of the 
total (including electric power, motor vehicle gasoline, diesel 
fuel, cast iron, steel, finished rolled metal, sulfuric acid, 
mineral fertilizers, soda ash, synthetic ammonia, wheeled 
cranes, automobiles, tractors, sawn lumber, cardboard, slate, 
asbestos-cement pipes, sleeves, and joints, video cassette 
recorders, color televisions, knitting machines, cameras, 
motorcycles, flax, hemp, and jute fabrics, raincoats, footwear, 
butter, fatty cheeses and feta cheese, canned meats and milk, 
confectionery items, salt, food concentrates, and mineral water); 
  --decreased for 104 entries, or 64 percent of the 
total. 
  Proceeding from the dynamics of output of the most important 
production varieties, the average daily volume of industrial 
production for the period of March 1994 which transpired is 
estimated to comprise 73 percent of the level for the same 
period of March of last year. 
  The following table shows data characterizing the output of 
the most important industrial production varieties for the first 
13 days of March 1994:

<H5>  Agriculture </H5>
  Preparations for the spring sowing. Due to 
insufficient sowing of winter crops, adverse wintering 
conditions, and reduced autumn plowing, the volume of field work 
to be accomplished this spring is great. Winter crops for this 
year's yield were sown over an area of 15.5 million hectares (20 
percent less than last year), including 14.3 million hectares 
(20 percent) for grain. According to data from the Russian 
Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental 
Monitoring, the condition of winter crops on the whole across 
the Russian Federation can be expected to be unsatisfactory over 
an area of 2.0-2.5 million hectares, or 13-16 percent of the 
total area of winter grains and green forage, as opposed to 1.9 
million hectares (9 percent) on the average for the past five 
years. Autumn plowing was accomplished over 41.9 million 
hectares--6.2 million (13 percent) less than in the fall of 1992. 
  The degree of provision of farms with seeds of spring grain 
crops is somewhat worse in general than last year (especially 
with respect to buckwheat, rice, and legumes). In 
January-February 1994, agricultural clients were supplied 0.9 
million tonnes of lime-containing materials (55 percent less 
than during the same period last year), 0.4 million tonnes of 
motor vehicle gasoline (49 percent less), 0.8 million tonnes of 
diesel fuel (52 percent less), and 10.3 million tonnes of peat 
(56 percent less). In February of this year, dispatch of fuel 
proceeded more intensively than in January:

  A 1.9-fold increase, on the average, is being seen over last 
year's level in volume of oil products purchased by farms 
through direct ties. However, the share of total sale volume 
attributable to free sales remains low (8-9 percent). 
  Supplies of oil products as of the beginning of March were 
significantly lower than last year's levels:

  Livestock. In January-February of this year, the 
sales volume of slaughtered livestock and poultry in all 
categories of farms was estimated to be 12 percent less than the 
volume for January-February of last year; production of milk was 
10 percent less, eggs--6 percent less. Livestock production 
output at personal farmsteads remained at the levels produced 
during the same period of last year. 
  The following table shows the dynamics of production volumes 
at agricultural enterprises in January-February:

  Numbers of cattle as of 1 March 1994 decreased by 7 percent, 
according to estimates, from the level of 1 March 1993 at the 
farms of all producers; of pigs--by 9 percent; of sheep and 
goats--by 13 percent. 
  The decrease observed in numbers of livestock is 
attributable 
primarily to agricultural enterprises, where 60-70 percent of 
all livestock is concentrated.

  The extent of provision of livestock with feed was somewhat 
greater than last year's level on the whole for farms in Russia. 
Remaining fodder per standard head of livestock amounted 8.2 
feed-unit quintals on average at the beginning of March of this 
year, as opposed to 7.5 feed-unit quintals as of this time last 
year. 
  In January-February of this year, procurement organizations 
effected purchases for state resources, from all producers, a 
volume of livestock and poultry 28 percent less than during the 
same period last year, milk--21 percent less, and eggs--6 
percent less. In this regard, agricultural enterprises increased 
their sales of livestock production at markets, through their 
own stores, through the public kitchen system, and through other 
channels. In all over the two-month period, these enterprises 
sold 13 percent of the total sales volume of livestock and 
poultry outside the state procurement network, 4 percent of the 
milk, and 7 percent of the eggs.

  Sale of fruits and vegetables. Sales of hotbed- 
and greenhouse-grown vegetables through all channels in 
January-February of this year decreased almost three-fold from 
last year's levels, including a 2.5-fold decrease in sales of 
cucumbers, and 3.4-fold decrease in sales of green vegetables. 
The share of total sales attributable to state purchases 
remained virtually unchanged from last year, amounting to about 
85 percent. 
<H5>  Income of the Populace </H5>
  The income of the populace in January-February of this year 
amounted to R32.4 trillion, a 9.2-fold increase over the same 
period last year. 
  In February of this year, available monetary income of the 
populace (income after mandatory payments and fees were made) 
increased 9.1-fold over the February 1993 level. The cost of 
goods and services increased approximately 8-fold. Real monetary 
income at the disposal of the populace was 13 percent higher 
this month than one year ago (in January it was 7 percent 
higher).

  In February 1994, the uppermost 20 percent of the populace 
had at its disposal 40 percent of all monetary income; the 
lowest 20 percent--only 7 percent (comparable figures for 
February 1993--20 and 8 percent, respectively; for July 1993--37 
and 7 percent; for December 1993--39 and 6 percent). 
  The coefficient of income concentration (Gini coefficient) 
in 
February 1994 was 0.301 (in January--0.343). 
  Values of the subsistence minimum for the Russian Federation 
populace (determined in accordance with Russian Ministry of 
Labor methodology) are as follows:

  Monetary income for a portion of the population was even 
lower than the cost of the food product selection taken into 
account when calculating the subsistence minimum. This segment 
includes families with many children, single-parent families 
with children, families with a large proportion of dependents in 
which those employed are receiving close to minimum wage, single 
pensioners and invalids.

  In February of this year, payments were made for the wage 
differences for wage increases effective 1 December 1993 and 1 
January 1994 to a number of categories of employees in the 
budget sphere and organs of government. The amount of pension 
equalization was increased. As a result, there was a significant 
decrease from the January level in the numbers and percentages 
of the population with disposal incomes lower than the 
subsistence minimum. In January 1993, the proportion of the 
population with monetary income lower than the subsistence 
minimum was 35.5 percent; in February 1993 it was 27.2 percent. 
  According to estimates, the average wage accrued by 
employees 
in February was R150,000, an increase of 6 percent over December 
1993. The amount of real wages in February of this year, 
calculated taking into account the consumer price index, was 80 
percent of the level for December 1993.

January of this year, both overall and for certain sectors of 
the economy:

  The reduction in wages in January of this year in a number 
of 
sectors of the economy is related to lump-sum payments for 
annual results which were made at the end of last year. 
  As of the beginning of 1994, there were 36.1 million 
pensioners in the Russian Federation registered with organs for 
social protection of the populace. There are 244 pensioners for 
every 1,000 in population (as of 1 January 1993, this figure was 
238; as of 1 January 1991--222).

<F P=106> [Article from PROMYSHLENNYY VESTNIK Supplement to RABOCHAYA </F>
TRIBUNA by the Interagency Commission for Energy Strategy: 
"Russia's Energy Strategy: the Main Points"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  A Necessary Foreword </H5>
  Today, PROMYSHLENNYY VESTNIK presents to its readers 
"Russia's Energy Strategy." This is the Russian Federation's 
integrated state fuel and energy program for the period up to 
the year 2010. 
  Its significance is determined by a whole series of 
factors. We will name just a few of them. 
  -- Russia has the largest reserves of fuel and energy 
resources and the world's second largest fuel and energy 
complex; 
  -- This complex brings in more than two-thirds of the 
country's currency revenues. In contrast to the majority of 
countries, Russia's TEK [Fuel and Energy Complex] is not simply 
an infrastructure sector of its national economy, but rather, 
the foundation of the entire economy; 
  -- Russia's Energy Strategy is the foundation and core 
of the economic doctrine for the revitalization of the Russian 
State. 
  A large collective of scholars and specialists worked 
on this document under the guidance of the Interagency 
Coordinating Commission headed by RF [Russian Federation] 
Minister of Fuel and Energy Yu. Shafranik. The main points of 
Russia's Energy Strategy were approved at an expanded meeting of 
the Interagency Commission. With due consideration of comments 
and suggestions made during discussion of the program in the 
ministries, agencies, public organizations and the mass media, 
Russia's Energy Strategy will be revised and submitted to the 
Russian Government for consideration. 
  We hope that our readers will also express their 
comments, opinions and suggestions. 
<H5>  I. Both the Engine and the Hostage </H5>
  The fuel and energy complex (TEK) occupies a special 
place in the economy. Figuratively speaking, it is the main 
engine of industry and a condition for the existence of the 
populace. From the electric railway and the airplane on 
transport routes and the machine tool and blast furnace in a 
shop to the gas stove, the electric bulb and the television set 
in an apartment -- all these things operate thanks to the energy 
supplied to them. A source of movement, heat and light and an 
information transmitter, in our time, the TEK is finding new 
"professions," making a person's life more comfortable and 
meaningful. This is why now, in the complicated reform times, 
the future fortunes of the fuel and power industry, without any 
exaggeration, are occupying the minds of all Russian 
citizens. 
  There are special reasons for this. Yes, one of the world's 
most powerful systems for ensuring vital needs and economic 
security has been created in Russia. Our country generates more 
than 10 percent of the world production of fuel. Also certain is 
the fact that Russia's fuel and energy complex is currently 
fully meeting the needs of the public and material production 
for fuel and energy. We would remind you that, last year, 70 
percent of all currency revenues was also obtained through the 
exporting of energy resources and the cross-delivery of 
commodity resources from the CIS [Commonwealth of Independent 
States] for industrial and consumer needs was ensured. It is no 
secret, however, that the overall amount of power output has 
fallen by 20 percent over the last 5 years and is continuing to 
fall. Just in 1993, Russia produced 8 percent fewer energy 
resources than it could have. But the country has not felt an 
acute shortage of them for a simple reason: under the conditions 
of the growing production slump in all sectors, energy 
consumption has fallen sharply in both industry and agriculture. 
So the energy sufficiency has turned out to be largely relative. 
Moreover, the TEK has sold the produced output to its 
traditional consumers within the country on credit, as a rule, a 
debt which has reached the gigantic sum of 10 trillion rubles 
[R], which is larger than half of all of Russia's debts taken 
together. This illusory wealth has driven the economy's powerful 
complex into a financial impasse. Called upon to enliven the 
economy, it has had to hold back on even the most necessary 
retooling, not to mention the introduction of new production. 
Yet, indeed, in order to maintain, for example, oil production 
at least at the current level, up to $5 billion annually need to 
be invested in this sector. However, capital investments in the 
energy complex, just in the past year, decreased by nearly a 
third. The TEK is losing its former industrial might. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-042-15A>      Gas Production in Billions of Cubic Meters </FIG>


  In a number of subdivisions of the oil and gas industries, 
the capacities in power engineering have begun to fall into 
decay calamitously rapidly. For example, more than 30,000 oil 
wells are now standing idle. But the plant which could 
straighten out the matter of the express delivery of spare parts 
is located in belligerent sovereign Azerbaijan. Nearly 70 
percent of the predicted hydrocarbon resources still require 
expensive surveying. Without this imperative work, the 
development of oil and gas production, especially at nearly 
inaccessible sites, will be in a state of confusion. In Russia, 
more than 80 coal mines need to be renovated without delay, 
because they are being plagued by accidents which frequently 
take human lives. Quite a few critical problems have arisen at 
electric power plants, including nuclear ones. If you add to 
this the fact that only 30 percent of the heating systems in the 
cities are operating correctly, while the rest, here and there, 
are warming the high heavens, -- even this small list of 
problems testifies to the fact that crisis situations are making 
themselves known in the energy sectors with ever increasing 
imperiousness. 
  How can they be overcome with the most minimal of losses? 
What kind of energy policy should be pursued so that, in the 
final tally, it would yield a perceptible benefit for each 
inhabitant of the country? The answers to these questions are 
provided by Russia's Energy Strategy, the drafting of which has 
just been completed. First of all, in all sectors, it is 
necessary to get rid of the antiquated habit of regarding the 
TEK as a gratuitous donor to the economy, because the transition 
to market relations, caused by the radical change in Russia's 
social and economic structure, is by no means a one-way street. 
  However, already, the first reform steps within the fuel and 
energy complex, the establishment of commercial companies which 
fastidiously began to establish market structures around 
themselves and not just to produce the raw material, but also to 
process it, providing up-to-date service to the consumer and 
delivering the end products to him for the price which they 
actually cost, caused a squall of completely unfounded 
accusations in the mass media. The drafters of the new Russian 
Energy Strategy consider it necessary to talk with the public 
right away in order to make their point in this controversy. The 
truth behind the accusations that the energy suppliers, having 
revised the prices for energy resources, caused a new, sharp 
surge of inflation, is obvious. Over the years of the wasteful 
"cannibalistic" economy, there developed in our country a 
careless squandering of energy resources in production and 
everyday life, at a level exceeding their expenditure in 
industrialized countries by a factor of 2-3. Market relations 
have inserted their own authoritative correction into domestic 
practice. Henceforth, the expenditure of energy will be 
controlled by the ruble. It is understandable that breaking an 
ingrained habit is hard, but it must be done, even though not 
everyone likes this.... 
  As for inflation, the energy resources price revision is 
least of all "at fault" here. Here are the official statistical 
data for last year: the share of fuel outlays in the overall 
industrial expenditures amounted to only 7-8 percent. 
  Allusions have been made to the very rapid rise of prices in 
domestic machine building. They are really striking: last year, 
they jumped 500 percent. However, a detailed analysis has shown 
that the prices in machine building rose only by 25 percent due 
to fuel and energy resources. Thus, the new prices for energy 
resources, which, according to the calculations, amount to just 
30 percent of world prices, played almost no role in the 
acceleration of the inflationary spiral and the market approach 
to price setting in the fuel and energy complex should be 
exonerated in the eyes of the public. 
  Then where does the root of all the problems lie? Our 
specialists believe that it lies in the exorbitantly high taxes. 
In their opinion, the TEK is so hobbled by the tax fetters that 
it has been literally left without the means of subsistence. 
Independent experts from Oxford cite one more reason -- the 
harsh credit policy. According to their calculations, up to 83 
percent of inflation is occurring because of the high credit 
rates. Any enterprise forced to obtain money from the banks at 
enormous interest rates in order to survive will try to jack up 
the prices for its own products. A new round of inflation 
inevitably follows this. It is perfectly obvious that 
loan-financed investment plans under such conditions will remain 
just plans. This is the very "stranglehold" on the TEK from 
which it is trying unsuccessfully in the meanwhile to free 
itself at least partly so that those who produce energy and 
those who use it might breathe easier. 
  This is why, having examined carefully the entire chain of 
interrelations -- the TEK -- the budget -- the consumer, the 
drafters of the Energy Strategy believe that changes in the very 
attitude toward the fuel and energy complex and its output on 
the part of the state and on the part of all citizens of Russia 
have become imminent. This requires both new laws and improved 
standard acts, which take into consideration world experience, 
and also up-to-date measures which will have an economic impact. 
  Elaborated in the Energy Strategy is a complete set of means 
for the development of Russia's power engineering, which 
includes: 
  -- the improvement of energy consumption and the promotion 
of 
energy conservation; 
  -- the optimization of the regions' energy interconnections; 
  -- the economically justified exporting of energy resources; 
  -- the renovation and efficient development of the TEK's 
production structure; 
  -- and scientific and technical progress in power 
engineering 
and related sectors. 
<H5>  II. Goals and Priorities of the New Energy Strategy </H5>
  Russia has a unique fuel and energy potential. Even 
now, found in its investigated mineral sites have been 13.4 
percent of the world's oil reserves, 41.7 percent of the gas 
reserves and 43 percent of the coal reserves. This has made it 
possible to create the world's second largest fuel industry, 
which produces more than 10 percent of the world production of 
raw fuel material. Russia's Energy Strategy has set as its main 
goal the maximum efficient use of natural riches for 
revitalizing the country's economy and raising the standard of 
living of its populace (bringing it up to the level of the 
European standards of living). 
  The required and maximum scenarios for the TEK's development 
and that of its sectors have been worked out with due 
consideration of the conditions of the domestic and foreign 
markets. 
  The TEK's required development has been determined so as to 
supply, on a guaranteed basis, the energy needs of Russia given 
reduced energy consumption (i.e., with maximum energy 
conservation) and the greatest economically justified exporting 
of energy resources or (what amounts to approximately the same 
thing) given an increase in energy consumption and a reduction 
in exporting. The TEK's maximum development will require that, 
if there is an increase in energy consumption (i.e., with likely 
amounts of energy conservation), favorable conditions be put 
together for a high level of exporting of Russian energy 
resources. 
  Both scenarios for the production of energy resources 
realize 
in essence a single strategy for the TEK's development, but they 
differ in the time frames, scale and, in some instances, in the 
sequence of operations. But, in both scenarios, what is 
envisioned, first and foremost, is an increase in the efficiency 
of direct energy services with a simultaneous decrease in the 
harmful impact of fuel and energy enterprises on the 
environment, which is different for each Russian citizen. In 
connection with this, the task is being set for the next 10-15 
years for shaping a socially- and economically-sound demand for 
energy services based on the principle of reasonable 
sufficiency. What will be achieved is a stable supply of fuel 
and energy for all consumers, with priority supplying of 
municipal and domestic needs, public transportation and the 
foodstuffs sphere with high-quality and ecologically clean 
energy resources. For example, up to half of the produced energy 
resources will be directed toward the production of consumer 
goods by the year 2000, which is 20 percent more than what is 
being allotted currently for these needs. This will be achieved 
through the shift from military-industrial products and heavy 
machine building to the widespread production of consumer goods. 
Special attention will be paid to improving the energy supply of 
Russia's rural localities. At the same time, the main task will 
be energy support for the radical social and economic 
transformations in the countryside and the accelerated 
introduction of advanced electrified and gas technologies and 
devices, as well as modern technologies based on liquid and 
high-quality graded fuel or briquetted solid fuel, capable of 
providing a radical improvement in everyday and working 
conditions, and, consequently, a high level of acclimatization 
of the rural populace: intensive resource conservation, 
preservation and the quality of agricultural products, an 
increase in capital productivity and the productivity of human 
labor in rural regions and, thereby, a sharp improvement in the 
efficiency of agricultural production. Most widely used will be 
concise, ecologically clean energy sources. In particular, 
contemplated for 1995 is the conducting of the experimental 
operation of a system for supplying energy to farmsteads, using 
non-traditional renewable energy sources. 
  The reorientation of energy consumption from industrial 
needs 
to supporting the public's vital needs has already become 
distinctly apparent in the last 3 years. This has been helped by 
the introduction of preferential rates for energy resources for 
everyday needs and part of the service-sphere enterprises, for 
agriculture and for public transportation. The benefits for 
energy conservation in these spheres will need to be retained 
for quite a long while yet (at least until the beginning of the 
economy's recovery from the economic crisis), decreasing them 
relatively and, what is the main thing, making them all more 
applicable. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-042-17A>      Production of Oil and of Gas Condensates in Millions of Metric Tons </FIG>


  Based on the extent of the increase in the populace's 
prosperity, its priority in being supplied with energy will be 
ensured more and more not by the preferential rates, but rather, 
fully by the paying demands of people for comfort and an 
increase in the quality of life as a whole. 
  The social reorientation of energy consumption will become 
apparent most obviously with respect to the highest-quality 
energy resource -- electricity. Whereas, in 1985, 29.5 percent 
of the total electric consumption went for the vital needs of 
the populace and, in 1990, the figure was 31.1 percent, this 
component will increase to 41-42 percent by 2000 and to 43-44 
percent by 2010. 
  In the area of centralized heating, the share of heating and 
the hot-water supply for municipal and domestic needs has always 
been traditionally high and amounted to 42-43 percent. The 
planned increase in providing the populace with housing and 
public buildings will cause a further increase in the share of 
this component of the centralized heating consumption to 44 
percent in 2000 and to 48-49 percent in 2010, despite all 
energy-conservation measures. 
  This trend will become apparent even more distinctly in 
supplying the populace's everyday needs using direct burning 
fuel: the increase by 2010 in the share of gas in the 
satisfaction of these needs by a factor of 1.5 on average and by 
a factor of nearly 2 in the countryside is an important social 
priority of the Energy Strategy. 
  The main means for the realization of this priority under 
the 
new economic conditions will be, in the first stage, 
preferential rates for gas and, subsequently, special measures 
for economic stimulation of rural gas facility installation: 
preferential credits for the construction of networks and the 
purchase of equipment and the joint conversion to joint-stock 
companies of RAO [Russian Joint-Stock Company] Gazprom [gas 
industry] and the gas-distribution companies and so on. 
  On the whole, the policy for the reorientation of energy 
consumption toward supplying the vital needs of the populace 
with the widespread use of the appropriate benefits and other 
economic incentives will lead to an increase in the share of 
these needs in the total consumption of primary energy resources 
in Russia from 24-25 percent at present to 28-29 percent in 2000 
and to 30-32 percent in 2010. 
  The social orientation of Russia's Energy Strategy also 
means 
it will be possible for any consumer by 2000 to make an 
economically sound selection of energy resources for his own 
energy needs. It is precisely at this that the so-called 
multipurpose "gas pause" is aimed -- a sharp increase in the 
share of natural gas in domestic consumption and in the energy 
exporting structure. 
  To be more specific, gas will amount to more than half of 
the 
entire production of energy resources in the country during the 
period in question. 
  In the scenario for the TEK's required development, the gas 
industry, up to 2003-2005, will be able to develop further 
without setting up large, new fuel centers, making maximum use 
of medium and even small fields in the developed gas-producing 
regions or in the immediate vicinity of the consumers. In the 
maximum scenario, by 2000, it will be necessary to develop the 
first section of the new Yamal gas-producing region, i.e., to 
begin the largest investment program by 1995. 
  It will be necessary to carry out basic renovation and 
partial replacement of the Unified Gas-Supply System for the 
purpose of increasing its energy and economic efficiency, to 
develop a system of underground gas-storage tanks in order to 
increase the reliability of the national economy's gas supply 
and the degree to which it can be manipulated and to increase 
several-fold the extraction of useful components from the 
produced gas (first of all, condensate, methane and other 
hydrocarbons). The present relatively stable state of the gas 
industry and its prospects for the near future make this 
management approach quite realistic. It must be emphasized that 
preference is being given to using gas in thermal power 
engineering while introducing the latest technologies for PGU 
and GTU [steam-and-gas and gas-turbine plants] and to replacing 
motor fuel with gas. In order to do this, there will be an 
increase in the production of motor vehicles with gas cylinders 
and gas equipment sets and expansion of the network of AGNKS 
[automated gas pumping and compressor stations] and the 
production of new-design gas cylinders has been organized. 
Together with the accelerated increase in electrification (by a 
third up to the year 2000), this will make it possible to reduce 
the use of other, environmentally harmful types of fuel by no 
less than 20 percent. 
  Similar highly economical manipulation of ecologically clean 
types of energy will make it possible to re-equip all sectors of 
the fuel and energy complex on a new scientific basis, to render 
their production harmless to a great extent, to reduce 
expenditures of materials and energy for the production of 
Russian goods by no less than a third and thereby to enhance 
their attractiveness in the world market. 
  The "gas pause," directly and indirectly, will have a 
beneficial effect, first of all, on the oil and coal industries 
and on power engineering. Prior to the year 2000, the oil 
production slump will be overcome and stable deliveries of raw 
hydrocarbon material and an increase in its integrated use will 
be achieved. In order to do this, it is necessary to maintain 
oil production at a level of no fewer than 270-280 million 
metric tons per year. It is being assumed that there will be a 
further intensification in the refining of oil up to 75 percent 
in 2000 and to 83-84 percent in 2010 given a radical renovation 
of the entire oil-refining industry, which will substantially 
increase the sale of gasoline and lubricants and tires for the 
increasing stream of vehicles in industry and among the 
populace, as well as of raw material for the chemical and 
microbiological industries. In turn, this will increase the 
production of currently so scarce medicines and the no less 
necessary latest rubbers with previously specified properties. 
And from here it is a straight path to the rubber parts being 
used ever more widely in machine building. In modern trucks, 
their number is increasing annually; In a KamAZ [Kama Motor 
Vehicle Plant truck], for example, there are already more than a 
thousand of them. The interdependence, the complicated 
interconnections and transformations of energy products from the 
well to the motor vehicle tire or conveyor belt, has found its 
own specific and well-founded embodiment in Russia's Energy 
Strategy. It has been calculated that the program for 
modernizing and renovating the oil-refining industry will take 
around 12-14 years and be implemented in stages. Among the most 
important work is the expansion of the network of motor vehicle 
service stations, the number of which, based on a competitive 
market environment, will increase by the year 2000 by a factor 
of approximately 2. 
  Tracked in no less detail have been the means for enhancing 
the quality of coal products -- from the large-scale shift to 
economical open-pit mining of this solid fuel at large fields to 
the introduction of safe technologies for the processing and use 
of coal. For the first time, a purely market emphasis is being 
placed not simply on delivering to the consumer the " 
combustible rock" in its natural form, but its highly profitable 
and, for the consumer (entrepreneur, farmer and vacationer), 
attractive conversion into coal pulp and briquets of an 
appropriate quality. Based on these examples, the Energy 
Program, besides other things, will teach the owner of natural 
warehouses modern enterprise and specific consideration of the 
consumer's interests. 
  The restructuring of Russia's coal industry is a most 
difficult task, requiring maximum caution and comprehensive 
consideration of social factors. 
  In the scenario for the TEK's required development, coal 
mining will decrease right up to 2005, and especially rapidly -- 
in the country's European regions. An increase in mining under 
these conditions is expected at mines of the Kuznetsk and 
Kansko-Achinsk basins in order to supply the regions of Siberia 
and partly the Urals, while setting aside the remaining basins 
more and more for the supplying of coal primarily to local 
customers. 
  In the maximum scenario, an increase in coal mining in the 
country is forecast by the year 2000, with its acceleration 
during the subsequent period with priority development of the 
Kuznetsk Basin and the KATEK [Kansko-Achinsk Fuel and Energy 
Complex] mainly in order to supply fuel to the electric power 
plants. The Energy Strategy reminds us at the same time: coal is 
the future. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-042-19A>      Coal Mining in Millions of Metric Tons </FIG>


  The greatest spreading of the development scenarios will be 
in electric power engineering and heating. 
  Given maximum energy conservation (the TEK's required 
development), the development of electric power engineering may 
be aimed not at increasing the installed capacity of the 
electric power plants, but rather, mainly at their radical 
renovation. Under these conditions, it is possible to abandon 
the construction of new condensing power plants in the majority 
of the country's regions and to ensure bringing new AES [nuclear 
power plant] units on line basically at the same pace as the 
removal from operation of first-generation reactors and RBMK 
reactors, while the development of electric power engineering 
may be carried out by the renovation of new TETss [heat and 
power plants] with gas-turbine and steam-and-gas plants. 
Moreover, given these conditions, it will be no big problem if 
there is a decrease in the capacity of AESs due to a delay in 
the development of new-generation nuclear reactors (the scenario 
of a temporary moratorium on the development of nuclear power 
engineering). 
  In contrast to this, the TEK's maximum development will 
require significant efforts not only for renovation but also for 
increasing the capacity of all types of electric power plants 
with their orientation toward different types of energy 
resources. This much more expensive scenario for the development 
of electric power engineering will also require, along with 
renovating existing TETss and constructing new ones using gas, 
increasing the capacity of AESs in regions of expensive fuel and 
constructing several powerful condensing electric power plants 
using Kansko-Achinsk and Kuznetsk coal in Siberia, the Urals and 
possibly the Volga River Region. 
  Envisioned in a number of remote regions of Russia's North 
and Northeast has been the construction of low-capacity nuclear 
plants of modular design, including underground ones as well. On 
the whole, the share of nuclear power engineering will remain as 
before and, by 2000, will amount to around 11.5-12 percent of 
the total production of energy and, by 2010, to 10-11.5 percent. 
  The share of hydraulic power engineering in individual 
regions of the country, particularly in the Far East, may 
increase significantly through the more complete use of the 
power-producing potential of rivers and the construction of a 
series of medium-capacity GESs [hydroelectric power plants]. 
  Also envisioned in the store of energy sources in the period 
in question is the more active development of local energy 
resources (small reserves of coal, gas and oil in regions with a 
developed infrastructure), as well as renewable and recycled 
energy resources (wind, geothermal, solar and water power, mine 
methane, lumber waste and industrial waste), especially for 
regions with scattered energy consumers. 
  Proclaimed as a main feature of the energy policy for the 
next few years and for the long run, in contrast to the former 
orientation toward a large-scale increase in the production of 
fuel and energy resources, and the highest priority of Russia's 
Energy Strategy is maximum energy conservation with a 
simultaneous increase in the efficiency of energy consumption. 
In contrast to traditional Russian wastefulness (we have plenty 
of everything!), henceforth, the habit of using energy sparingly 
will be inculcated more and more. In this matter, we no longer 
have anywhere to which to retreat: here we are, as in many other 
things, truly "ahead of the whole world": the expenditure of 
energy per unit of product produced in Russia is higher by a 
factor of 2 than in the USA with a similar production structure. 
This is why it is being emphasized in the Energy Strategy that 
there is nothing cheaper and nothing more profitable literally 
for each Russian citizen than the thrifty expenditure of energy 
in production and in everyday life. Ultimately, Russian citizens 
should prove that they are able to count kilograms, kilowatts 
and meters just as zealously as they have been able to obtain or 
produce them. Enterprise in the conservation of resources will 
become the business of all of society, if the press, radio and 
television appeal to it unobtrusively, with psychological 
precision. Henceforth, a significant portion of advertising 
time, especially in the electronic mass media, should be given 
to the problems of energy conservation with a graphic 
demonstration of its results and the means of achieving it. A 
special Russian Federation State Prize could be awarded to 
far-sighted technical and economic innovations aimed at every 
possible kind of energy conservation. 
  This will arouse the obvious interest of every inhabitant of 
the country, if one thing is not disregarded, i.e., the not 
insignificant circumstance, which is being given special 
emphasis in the Energy Strategy, that the Energy Conservation 
Program already approved by the government prescribes a 
combination of economic and directive measures. The energy 
policy up to the year 2000 provides, first and foremost, for 
active economic stimulation of energy resource conservation 
through price factors; the placing into effect of standards and 
certificates for energy-consuming and widely used equipment; 
equipping the consumers with instruments for metering and 
regulating the expenditure of energy resources; and the right to 
sell them at freely-set prices within Russia and partially 
exporting them. Federal and regional energy-conservation funds 
are being established. 
  Being introduced are preferential granting of credit and 
partial financing using budget assets and the funds of consumers 
who make the most of energy-conservation measures. The Energy 
Strategy grants local organs of executive authority the right to 
impose, when need be, based on the findings of Gosenergonadzor 
[state committee for energy use oversight], economic sanctions 
for wasting energy, as well as to impose a system of 
energy-consumption quotas for gas, heat and electricity. 
  Organizational measures for saving energy both in the next 
few years and in the long run will be actively supported by a 
purposeful technical policy which will be geared toward: a 
maximum reduction of losses and an increase in the energy 
efficiency of equipment and technologies in all energy-producing 
(including production and transport) and energy-consuming 
processes; the development of ecologically and technologically 
safe equipment; an efficient centralized energy supply and 
decentralization of energy sources with a maximum effort to 
locate them near energy consumers in order to reduce their 
investment cycle; the encouragement of the establishment of 
in-house energy sources at industrial enterprises, including 
those which use industrial waste; preference being given to the 
renovation of existing power installations over the construction 
of new, large power installations; the widespread use of the 
resources of conversion systems (gas turbines and new materials 
and technologies) for the production and use of energy; the 
industrial development (with state support) of qualitatively new 
technologies for nuclear power engineering, the thorough 
processing of coal and the storage of energy; new energy 
sources; and maximum accident and economical safety of all 
energy capacities without exception. 
  In determining this system of measures, Russia's Energy 
Strategy is proceeding from the fact that, given the current 
level of energy intensiveness of products, by the year 2000 or 
even sooner, an unsatisfied demand for energy resources may 
emerge in the amount of 400-450 million metric tons of 
equivalent fuel. It is impossible to provide it through an 
increase in the production of TER [fuel and energy resources]. 
Domestic products will not be able to compete in the world 
market because of their so low energy efficiency. 
  What will help in this situation is the saving of energy 
resources. Calculations made by specialists for the Energy 
Strategy show that the annual requirement for fuel and energy 
may be reduced by 55-60 million metric tons of equivalent fuel. 
And, by the year 2000, it may be reduced by 200-250 million 
metric tons of equivalent fuel while maintaining the volume of 
goods production of industrial products and services and while 
enhancing the quality and competitiveness. The specialists 
believe that, in the near future, the expenditures of just oil 
alone may decrease by 10 percent. By selling it at world prices, 
the country will receive around $15 billion. The current level 
of oil production can be supported using these funds for more 
than 3 years. 
  This information on the Energy Strategy will be of interest 
to every inhabitant of Russia. According to the calculations of 
the Russian Academy of Sciences' National Economic Forecasting 
Institute, each percentage point of energy savings produces a 
0.4 percent increase in the national income by the next year and 
approximately 0.1 percent annually in the next 2 decades. 
  Proper energy use is more efficient by a factor of 5 than 
energy-conservation expenditures. Energy savings will have a 
beneficial effect on the health of Russian citizens because, by 
the year 2000, the economical expenditure of energy will make it 
possible to reduce harmful discharges into the open air by 1.5 
million metric tons. 
  In addition to the purely economic and ecological benefits, 
the energy transformations include the further use of the 
powerful unifying potential of the federal power systems to 
maintain the integrity of Russia and to strengthen the mutual 
economic ties between the CIS countries. 
  The new efficient energy policy will combine the regions' 
natural yearning for self-sufficiency and self-management of the 
end energy resources (electricity and heat, motor fuel and 
domestic fuel) while maintaining the unity of Russia's energy 
complex as the most important factor of the economic and 
political integration of the country through the further 
development of the unified federal power systems (intersystem 
power transmissions and cross-country oil and gas pipelines) 
which ensure the reliability and viability of the energy supply 
for all the territories and the efficient use of the available 
unevenly distributed natural energy resources in the interests 
of all the regions and of the federation as a whole. 
  Provision has been made for improving existing interregional 
and intersectorial fuel and energy centers and establishing new 
ones using the shared assets of the territories with the state's 
participation (and the participation of other states) through 
the granting of preferential long-term credits and investments 
(KATEK, Yamalgazenergo [Yamal gas energy], the Timano-Pechora 
TEK and others). 
  The independent regional power companies supplying consumers 
with energy products produced locally both through acquired fuel 
and energy resources and through their own economical ones, 
including non-traditional types of energy, will find active 
support. 
  In the next 10-15 years, existing interregional and 
intersectorial fuel and energy centers will be improved and new 
ones will be established. The regions' interests will also be 
taken into account by the expansion of their share of ownership 
in the capital stock of the power installations while the unity 
of the technological management of the systems will be 
maintained by the appropriate federal state organs. 
  The regional energy policy will take into account the key 
differences in the conditions of the energy supply and the 
structure of the fuel and energy balance of such areas of the 
country as the northern, southern and central regions of 
Russia's European section, the Urals, Siberia, the Far East and 
the regions of the Far North. 
  The Energy Strategy differentiates the procedure for energy 
management in the center and locally. The federal state organs, 
using the directive procedure, exercise control over the 
activities of the federal power systems and nuclear power 
engineering; they manage the strategic reserves of energy 
resources; they develop the standards and norms for the safe and 
efficient operation of power installations and plants and the 
organization of state inspection for their observance; and they 
control the licensing of the foreign economic activities of TEK 
entities. 
  Under the joint jurisdiction of federal organs and entities 
of the Russian Federation are: the licensing of the activities 
of enterprises for the development of natural resource deposits, 
of enterprises operating as part of the federal power systems 
and also of nuclear energy installations; determination of the 
conditions for the licensing of the activities of energy 
enterprises responsible for a reliable fuel and energy supply 
for consumers and monitoring the observance of the issued 
licenses; and the organization of the energy supply under the 
conditions of emergency situations. 
  Under the exclusive jurisdiction of Russian Federation 
entities are: the procedure for the functioning of installations 
not part of the federal power systems; the issuing of licenses 
for the construction of new fuel and power installations and the 
expansion of existing ones and the allocation of land for them; 
and the adoption of additional requirements for the ecological 
safety and energy efficiency of installations situated on the 
territory under their jurisdiction. 
  The state organs do not interfere in the economic activities 
of energy enterprises, with the exception of the emergency 
situation conditions specified by legislation of the Russian 
Federation and its entities. 
  The requirements for the economic efficiency and 
competitiveness of Russia's energy enterprises in the domestic 
and foreign markets will lead to the large-scale reorganization 
of the TEK's production structure, to the extinction of certain 
old energy sources and to the development of new ones. During 
the drafting of the Energy Strategy, this complicated process 
was modeled on the specific participation of existing and new 
fuel and energy centers in domestic markets (for the country's 
regions), and in the markets of the near and far abroad. 
  Two qualitatively different stages stand out in the 
reorganization of power engineering's production structure. 
  In the first stage (the next 3-5 years), the competitiveness 
of Russian energy resources is determined not so much by new 
investment projects as by the ability of enterprises to adapt 
their own operating costs to the constantly changing market 
conditions inside Russia and to obtain quotas and licenses for 
entering foreign markets. During this period, the main thing is 
the survival of the energy enterprises under the conditions of 
the increasing non-payments, the acute lack of working capital 
and the progressive aging of fixed capital given the shortage of 
funds even for its repair and maintenance. Apparently, large 
associations like RAO Gazprom and RAO YeES Rossii [Unified Power 
System of Russia] will be able to endure this, but the fate of 
smaller associations and independent enterprises will depend 
entirely on the effectiveness of the government's measures for 
stabilizing the situation in the TEK. 
  Such measures should include: 
  -- overcoming the non-payment crisis through the paying off 
of state debts to the budget-controlled enterprises which are 
consumers of energy resources, the compulsory granting of credit 
for payment for the energy resources of bankrupt debtors and the 
improvement of the draft system of payment for energy resources, 
in particular, through their compulsory repayment using shares 
of the debtor enterprises; 
  -- gradually increasing the prices for energy resources 
until, in 1995-1996, they come into line with world prices; 
  -- establishing specialized investment funds at the disposal 
of joint-stock companies through deductions from the production 
cost of products with the right to use them only for capital 
investments in power engineering and energy conservation; 
  -- and establishing an insurance fund from TEK royalty 
payments for the social support of workers of idled or closed 
fuel and energy enterprises. 
  The successful functioning of the indicated crisis-solving 
measures and others will make it possible in the stage in 
question: 
  -- to ward off an incipient slump in gas production, to 
restore its pre-crisis level in 1995 and to increase steadily 
the production of gas in developed regions with the expansion of 
the throughput capacity of the existing gas pipelines and the 
building of a new export gas pipeline across Belarus and Poland 
into Central Europe; 
  -- to slow down and, in 1996-1997, to stop (at the level of 
280-330 million metric tons per year) the slump in the 
production of oil and condensate and to begin the renovation of 
the oil-refining industry with an increase in the extent of oil 
refining to 67 percent in 1997 and enhancement of the quality of 
petroleum products; 
  -- to stop by the end of the stage the overall slump in coal 
mining at the level of 270-280 million metric tons per year 
while continuing the structural reorganization of the sector in 
favor of open-pit coal mining in the country's eastern regions 
with a gradual controlled reduction in shaft mining and the 
closing of unprofitable enterprises; 
  -- to increase substantially the energy and economic 
efficiency of electric power engineering through the withdrawal 
from operation and the renovation of obsolete and worn-out 
equipment while increasing the proportion of the combined 
generation of electricity and heat and reducing, when electric 
consumption drops, basically the condensation generation of 
electricity; 
  -- to maintain the AESs' generation of electricity in 
regions 
where they are economically efficient while decreasing it in the 
rest of the regions in conformity with the reduction in electric 
consumption, proceeding on the basis of the competitiveness of 
the AESs with electric power plants using organic fuel; 
  -- and to stimulate the interest of consumers in the use of 
alternative energy sources, including non-traditional renewable 
ones. 
  The energy resource production dynamics proposed in the 
Energy Strategy will make it possible not just to supply 
completely Russia's domestic energy consumption, but also to 
increase somewhat the exporting of energy resources to the CIS 
countries and the far abroad while improving its structure in 
favor of the converted energy resources. 
  In the second stage (up to the end of the period in 
question), the improvement of the TEK's production structure 
will be ensured by the conditions of the competitiveness of 
Russian energy resources in the markets of the far and near 
abroad with the energy resources of other regions of the world 
and in domestic markets (for the country's regions), proceeding 
on the basis of the competition among the large fuel and energy 
joint-stock companies with one another and with local fuel and 
energy enterprises. 
<H5>  III. Science and Power Engineering </H5>
  Over the course of almost the last 50 years, nearly all 
the basic and applied scientific problems in the area of power 
engineering were solved by the forces of Russian science. For a 
number of directions, first and foremeost, those associated with 
the transmission of electricity over extremely long distances 
with high-voltage alternating and direct currents, with the 
establishment of new-generation, safe AESs, with the 
high-efficiency combined generation of electricity and heat, and 
with the extremely long-distance pumping of large amounts of 
natural gas through gas pipelines up to 1.4 meters in diameter, 
domestic developments are in no way inferior to the best world 
achievements. 
  At the same time, for other directions, including 
steam-and-gas and gas-turbine electric power plants, the 
solution of the ecological problems in electric power 
engineering, the reduction of non-production losses of 
electricity and heat during their transporting and distribution 
among end consumers and the automation of technological 
processes during the production of electricity and heat, Russian 
developments have lagged behind the leading foreign ones to one 
degree or another. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-042-22A>      Electricity Production in Billions of Kilowatt-Hours </FIG>


  The changes occurring in the country's social system and in 
economic relations have sharply reduced the opportunities for 
the state to finance scientific and technical progress from 
federal budget funds. But, at the same time, the state should 
retain for itself the important levels of determining influence 
on scientific and technical progress in power engineering. 
  In the next few years of the transition period, serious 
financial support of the most important directions of scientific 
and technical progress should be maintained through the use of 
state budget funds, ones like: 
  -- preserving the environment in the first stage and 
improving it in the next stage; 
  -- developing new, most promising and large energy sources 
which are of nationwide or interregional importance in nearly 
inaccessible regions with an undeveloped infrastructure, harsh 
climatic conditions and adverse mining and geological 
conditions: the shelves of the northern seas, the Yamal 
Peninsula and others; 
  -- large scientific and technical tasks in power 
engineering, 
the realization of which may be of limited nationwide 
importance, but the achievement of the final results for which 
is associated with great rick, because of which the commercial 
structures and sectors will not want to spend their own funds 
(thermonuclear power engineering, superconductivity, space-based 
power engineering, synthetic fuels and so on); 
  -- ensuring the safety of nuclear power engineering, 
establishing and developing new-generation nuclear power plants 
and localizing (eliminating) radioactive waste, first and 
foremost, the long-lived and most dangerous types; 
  -- developing technologies and equipment which will ensure 
the acceleration of oil and gas prospecting operations, a 
reduction in the time frames and the expenditures for the 
conversion of geological hydrocarbon resources into industrial 
reserves with an economic assessment of their development, 
mobile prospecting and surveying equipment suitable for use 
within the framework of small and medium-sized business in the 
area of the geological surveying of locally important, small 
hydrocarbon deposits; 
  -- and enhancing the efficiency of the transporting of 
natural gas over great distances, including by converting it 
into other types of energy resources. 
  The country's scientific and technical development should be 
geared toward the highest world standards and conform to them 
right away where this is possible and over time where this is 
difficult. 
  One necessary thing is the participation of Russian 
enterprises (companies) in the development of international 
projects which give them the right to make subsequent use of the 
knowledge accumulated through joint efforts. 
  The solving of applied scientific and technical problems 
with 
state financial support should henceforth be carried out 
basically within the framework of the state scientific and 
technical programs, Ecologically Clean Power Engineering and 
Progressive Technologies for the Integrated Development of the 
Fuel and Energy Resources of Russia's Mineral Deposits. Basic 
research in the sphere of power engineering should be conducted 
in accordance with the Russian Academy of Sciences' programs and 
plans. 
  Other directions of scientific and technical progress in the 
country's fuel and energy complex, as well as in the power 
engineering and electrical engineering industries, should be 
implemented within the framework of the sectorial programs 
financed from the assets of the budget funds of joint-stock 
companies, of non-budget funds, of commercial structures, and of 
individual interested companies, enterprises and organizations. 
At the same time, here as well, the state should retain for 
itself the possibility of exerting specific influence on the 
entire process of scientific and technical progress, especially 
in the initial state (in the next 2-3 years). 
  In electric power engineering, scientific research and 
development in the long run should be aimed, first and foremost, 
at increasing the reliability, safety and efficiency of the 
electric and heat supply while steadfastly maintaining the 
requirements for protection of the natural environment. In order 
to solve these problems, it is necessary to develop and to 
organize the production of equipment for using qualitatively new 
technologies. 
  First and foremost, scientific and technical progress in 
electric power engineering should be aimed at the development 
and widespread use within the country of steam-gas electric 
power plants which operate on natural gas and at the renovation 
of existing steam-turbine thermal electric power plants which 
operate on gas. During this same period, the feasibility of the 
industrial use of thermal electric power plants with solid-fuel 
fluidized-bed furnaces should be demonstrated and the work on 
increasing the level of safety of existing nuclear power plants 
should basically be completed. 
  Special units for cleaning sulfur oxides from flue gases 
should be developed by 1995-1997 and their installation begun at 
thermal electric power plants under construction. During the 
subsequent period, they should become widely used at existing 
thermal electric power plants. 
  During the period up to 1995, the development and testing of 
pilot models of wind-driven electric plants with unit capacities 
of 100 kilowatts and 250 kilowatts should be completed and 
series production begun of new-generation solar collectors, of 
amorphous-silicon photoelectric modules, of portable, 
self-contained photoelectric stations, of 
prefabricated-collapsible solar water-pumping units, of 
free-standing mini-hydroelectric power plants, and of other 
types of units which operate on non-traditional renewable energy 
sources, including geothermal, solar and biomass. In 1995, a set 
of operations should be performed in the area of hydrogen power 
engineering, the ecologically safe localization of radioactive 
waste and the production and use of a water-coal slurry for 
power-engineering purposes. Planned for 1995 are the manufacture 
and testing of a pilot model of highly economical electrolyzers 
with a solid polymer electrolyte and, in 1996, the placement 
into operation of an experimental industrial module of a 
plasma-chemical membrane process for producing hydrogen from 
sulfur-laden natural gas, of an experimental hydrogen power 
plant and so on. 
  In the mid-term plan (the period up to 2000-2003), the basic 
directions of scientific and technical progress should be the 
demonstration of the feasibility of the new generation of safe 
nuclear power reactors currently under development, of 
ecologically clean, solid-fuel thermal electric power plants, of 
high-efficiency photoelectric converters, of wind-driven power 
plants, and of technologies for the gasification of biomass. In 
1998, in particular, a pilot power-generating unit using 
Kansko-Achinsk coal with gradual burning of pre-heated coal dust 
and using cloth filters to trap ash and sulfur oxides should be 
built. Planned for the year 2000 is the placement into operation 
of a pilot steam-and-gas plant with a capacity of 300 megawatts, 
which operates on inferior-quality Donetsk anthracite culm, 
which is burned in a furnace with a circulating fluidized bed 
and equipped with an electrostatic precipitator with an 
alternating voltage. 
  Prior to the beginning of the next century, it is 
contemplated that the work on plans for a new generation of safe 
nuclear power plants will be completed and pilot power units 
with VVER-1000 [water-moderated water-cooled power reactor], 
VPBR-600 and VVER-500 reactors will be placed into operation. 
  The tasks of scientific and technical progress in the 
long-term plan (up to 2010) should be associated with the 
development of a new generation of safe nuclear power plants, 
including ones equipped with fast reactors, and the development 
of technologies for the safe localization (elimination) of 
long-lived and especially dangerous radioactive wastes. During 
the period up to 2010, the feasibility of the large-scale use of 
high-efficiency and inexpensive photoelectric converters and 
also of fuel cells with intracyclic gasification of coal should 
be demonstrated. By the same time frame, it is necessary to 
perform scientific research on the non-traditional concept of a 
nuclear plant with natural safety. 
  In the short-term and mid-term plans, a great deal of work 
must be done on increasing the technical level of the country's 
heating industry. Solid-fuel boiler plants should be equipped 
with low- and medium-capacity boilers with fluidized-bed 
furnaces and ones with a circulating fluidized bed, as well as 
ones which operate on a water-coal slurry. It is necessary to 
develop gas-cleaning systems for them, including ones not just 
for trapping ash, but also, when need be, for removing sulfur 
and nitrogen. 
  For small and medium-sized consumers, including widely 
scattered ones, self-contained mini-TETss [heat and power 
plants] or heat-generating plants, as well as various types of 
heat-pumping plants, are needed. 
  Future heat sources should be reliable, mechanized and 
automated, manufactured as complete sets at the plants (or 
consist of manufactured units) and be safe and ecologically 
clean so that they could be installed at the consumers' places 
(or in consumption centers). 
  New methods, technologies and equipment will be introduced 
for prospecting for and surveying oil fields, including 
deep-seated horizons, unmapped traps, high-viscosity oils, 
natural bitumens, low-permeability reservoirs, gas condensate 
and natural gas in order to increase the resource supply of the 
country's oil and gas complex and the number of proven 
recoverable reserves of hydrocarbon raw material. It will still 
be necessary to increase labor productivity seriously at 
drilling operations through the development over the course of 
1994-1997 of new methods for crushing the mined rock. 
  Work is supposed to be completed not later than 1996 on the 
development of promising technologies for extracting 
hydrocarbons from the mineral sites, on the effect of vibration 
waves and electrohydraulics on deposits, on increasing the 
pools' oil yield and on increasing the capacity of oil 
production by using ecologically safe biotechnologies and 
biopolymers. 
  Needed are the development of equipment and technologies 
which ensure an increase in the degree of use of petroleum gas 
up to 91-95 percent as opposed to 74-75 percent at present, an 
increase in the production, from natural and petroleum gas, of 
long distillate of light hydrocarbons and condensed gas by a 
factor of 2-3 and of ethane by a factor of 8-10; and the 
formation of integrated gas-processing plants which ensure 
efficient use of hydrocarbon raw material and non-hydrocarbon 
components (sulfur, helium, carbon dioxide and nitrogen) of 
natural and petroleum gas. 
  Provision has been made for the widespread introduction of 
progressive technologies and new types of oil-industry and 
repair equipment for increasing efficiency in opening up 
productive pools by 10-15 percent while developing oil, gas and 
gas condensate fields, increasing by 3-4 percentage points the 
mean-time-between-repairs period for the operation of wells and 
reducing by a factor of 1.5-1.7 the labor-intensiveness of oil 
production. 
  The annual productivity of a drilling rig will be increased 
by a factor of 1.8-2 and the productivity and 
labor-intensiveness of well construction by a factor of 1.5-2.2. 
  Technologies and equipment should be developed, which ensure 
the thorough extraction of valuable components from gas and the 
efficient use of crude gas, which will make it possible to 
satisfy the growing needs of the national economy for long 
distillate of light hydrocarbons, sulfur, helium motor fuel and 
raw material for the production of plastics. 
  Serious problems must be solved in the area of gas 
transporting. A large scientific and production problem is 
maintaining the system of cross-country pipeline transport in 
working condition. 
  In order to reduce the energy-intensiveness of gas 
transporting by 20-25 percent and to reduce labor-intensiveness 
by a factor of 2-2.5, it is necessary to develop and to 
introduce automated GPAs [gas-pumping units] with an efficiency 
of 35-36 percent (in particular, through the use of regenerators 
with a high degree of regeneration -- 81-87 percent). 
  The prospects for hydrocarbon production are associated with 
the development of oil and gas fields on the continental shelf. 
First and foremost, technologies and equipment will be developed 
and placed into service for fields: 
  -- in shallow-water areas -- with a sea depth of down to 20 
meters (the Kruzenshternovskiy and Kharasaveyskiy gas-condensate 
fields in the coastal area of the Yamal Peninsula, the 
Prirazlomnyy oil field in the region of the Pechora Bay and 
others); 
  -- and in areas with a sea depth of down to 50-150 meters 
(the Leningradskiy and Rusanovskiy gas-condensate fields in the 
Kara Sea and others). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-042-25A>      Oil Refining and the Production of Petroleum Products in Millions of Metric Tons </FIG>

  Using the resources of the conversion sectors and industrial 
cooperation with leading foreign firms, developed and placed 
into service in production will be highly efficient systems and 
equipment for conducting off-shore geophysical and 
engineering-geological operations, modern equipment for drilling 
off-shore wells down to 6,500 meters deep, and reliable 
equipment for field facilities for producing and preparing for 
transport oil and gas from off-shore fields, including a unique 
ice-resistant deep-sea platform for a sea depth down to 400 
meters. 
  In the coal industry, enhancement of productivity and safety 
and improvement of working conditions during the mining, 
preparation and processing of coal will be achieved by the 
development and placement into service during the period up to 
the year 2000 of technologies and equipment which permit: an 
increase in the level of mechanization of the mining of coal 
seams using shortwalls in complicated mining-and-geological 
conditions, the mining of coal from steep seams using hydraulic 
mining, the working of flat coal seams leaving the rock 
completely in the mine shaft and of highly-gaseous flat seams 
using inert means; non-traditional underground coal mining and 
the removal of coal seams using the hydraulic pulse method; 
underground coal mining using physico-chemical, vibration-pulse 
and other actions on the coal seam; the ecologically clean 
preparation of coal and the transporting and burning of 
water-coal slurry. 
  Among the most important intersectorial scientific and 
technical problems, the solving of which is necessary for 
enhancing the technical level of power engineering, are: 
  -- systematic investigation of the interconnection between 
socio-economic progress and the development of the energy 
industry and substantiation of the strategies for the 
development of Russia's fuel and energy complex as part of the 
world energy industry; 
  -- studying the impact of the energy industry on the 
environment on local, regional and global levels, increasing the 
trustworthiness of the predictions of global changes in climate 
and investigating the possibilities for preventing them or 
adapting to them; 
  -- of the prediction of the development of equipment and 
technologies of the future in the area of the production, 
conversion and use of fuel and energy resources for the 
formation of long-term programs and plans and of the 
organization of specific anticipatory scientific research; 
  -- of hydrodynamics and gas dynamics, of heat exchange and 
mass transfer, of burning and other chemical transformations 
with respect to processes which occur in energy and 
environmental protection equipment (for its designing and 
operation); 
  -- the strength and properties of materials used in power 
engineering and the development of new, promising materials; 
  -- thermonuclear fusion; 
  -- and information science and materials and principles for 
the development of equipment and automation systems which 
provide the basis for scientific and technical progress in power 
engineering. 
<H5>  IV. Means and Mechanisms of the Energy Policy </H5>
  The rapid entry of Russia into the market assumed a 
slowing down of the inflation rate and the production slump. 
However, the purely monetaristic approach proved to be futile, 
because, without proper social protection of the populace during 
the reform period, it only aggravated the crisis events in the 
economy and it began to drag Russia into the trap of delayed 
development. Purposefully continuing a policy of intensification 
of the reforms, at the same time, the Russian Government is 
changing the reformist tactics on the run. Especially since, due 
to a number of reasons, there emerged a real prospect of 
exhausting the raw material, finished material and labor 
foundations of the economy. 
  In this complicated situation, the reformers' eyes have 
again 
turned to the fuel and energy complex. After all, according to 
the data of the Russian Academy of Sciences' Central 
Economic-Mathematics Institute, around two-thirds of the profit 
created in the material production sectors is accumulating in it 
and, for good reason, in the Energy Strategy, it is being 
assigned the role of a unique locomotive for the economic 
transformations. In looking for means and mechanisms which, 
figuratively speaking, would set this locomotive going at full 
speed, the drafters of the prospective directions for developing 
power engineering came to the conclusion that, during the reform 
era, in view of the sector's special features and with due 
consideration of the world experience, combining the methods of 
direct state regulation of power engineering with the active 
formation of a state-controlled energy market is the most 
acceptable. 
  State regulation of power engineering will be accomplished 
through the selection of vitally important directions for the 
TEK's development and selectively supporting them, developing 
them and providing purposeful federal investment programs, 
especially programs promoting energy conservation and scientific 
and technical progress and the development of ecologically safe 
and non-traditional energy sources. 
  The state recognizes and guarantees the equal rights of all 
types of ownership of the property and products of the fuel and 
energy complex for the purposes of eliminating the 
monopolization of energy production and the energy supply, 
reducing the cost of fuel and energy for consumers and creating 
a strong economy. 
  The state is shaping the energy market using price and tax 
policies which ensure the elimination of the distortions of the 
prices for energy resources and other fuels. The transition to 
reasonable fuel prices will be constantly guided by the world 
market prices and will ensure a reduction of taxes on the 
processing industry and the service sphere through royalty 
payments and taxes on the excess profits of fuel enterprises. A 
subsequent policy for forming a competitive environment in power 
engineering will be pursued through the establishment of 
valuable economic market entities and a market infrastructure. 
There will be improved laws and an adequately complete system of 
standard acts regulating the mutual relations of the market 
entities with one another, with the organs of state management 
and with the public, as well as a set of incentives and 
conditions for energy conservation. An active investment policy 
will be pursued through the creation of conditions for the 
self-financing of fuel and energy enterprises and the expansion 
of the circle of investors while capital investments from the 
budget will be minimized. 
  Let us examine these means and mechanisms of the new Energy 
Strategy in more detail. 
  The price and tax policies pursued by the state will be 
aimed 
at a gradual transition to price parity for the basic groups of 
goods: industrial products, consumer goods and energy resources 
with due consideration of the level of wages and other incomes 
of the citizenry. 
  The upper limit of domestic wholesale prices for energy 
resources will be the level of world prices with due 
consideration of the corresponding ruble exchange rate, as well 
as of the costs for transporting and selling the energy 
resources. 
  The lower limit of the control range of prices will be 
determined by the cost of the "strenuous self-financing" of the 
energy enterprises, one which ensures that they do not operate 
at a loss (with the partial exception of coal mining) and 
ensures the needed investment amount for retooling and 
development and for deriving an adequate profit. 
  Artificially supporting prices below this level, maintaining 
the economy's energy-wasting nature, would require enormous 
budget subsidies for supporting the TEK (around 100 million 
rubles annually), which would lead to the additional taxation of 
other sectors of the economy. Thus, the state will no longer 
subsidize the TEK. 
  Within the boundaries of the designated price limits, the 
state will pursue a policy of differentiated price setting for 
individual energy resources, taking into account their consumer 
value and the energy producers' monopoly, being guided by the 
following principles; 
  -- prices for non-monopolized types of energy resources: for 
oil and petroleum products, steaming coal and local types of 
fuel which are not technologically irreplaceable for consumers 
should be unregulated; 
  -- delivery conditions and wholesale prices should be 
regulated for irreplaceable types of fuel and energy: coking 
coal and coke for metallurgy, steaming coal, peat, shale, 
natural and incidental gases for consumers outside the Unified 
Gas-Supply System's coverage area. These prices are set based on 
a contract between the energy product supplier and the energy 
consumer under arbitration control on the part of the regional 
power commissions; 
  -- prices for electricity and heat from centralized sources 
should be established by the regional power commissions; 
  -- prices for piped natural gas in the coverage area of the 
Unified Gas-Supply System's "natural" monopoly, as well as for 
condensed gas and electricity for the public, will be 
established by the state at the federal level. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-042-27A>      Structure of Centralized Heating (2000 AD) in Millions of Gigacalories </FIG>


  Prices for gas, taking into account its consumer value, 
should not be lower than the prices for fuel oil, steaming coal 
and other boiler and furnace fuel for consumers in an area where 
energy resources are interchangeable. 
  State regulation of energy resource prices will limit the 
energy enterprises' level of profitability. A progressive tax on 
excess profits in the fuel sectors, especially in the gas and 
oil sectors, as well as an increase in the share of the royalty 
component in the price for natural energy resources as payments 
for the mineral resources, will make it possible to reduce 
gradually the taxes on profit and value added in the processing 
industry. 
  Indirect regulation of prices for oil and petroleum products 
will also be carried out by means of customs duties on their 
exporting. 
  Selective protectionism for energy-intensive enterprises 
vitally important for the country's economy and defense will 
become an integral part of the state's price and tax policies. 
  The formation of a competitive environment in the TEK is 
aimed at reducing production costs and the cost of fuel and 
energy and enhancing the quality of energy services rendered to 
the consumer. It will be carried out mainly through the 
denationalization of TEK enterprises, primarily through 
conversion to joint-stock companies. 
  For the purposes of consolidating the interests of federal 
and regional structures, energy resource producers and 
consumers, TEK enterprises and related industries (machine 
building, metallurgy, the construction complex and others), the 
state will encourage the establishment of mixed joint-stock 
companies with proportional participation of all the interested 
structures, including foreign partners as well. To this end, the 
participation of Russian structures in the conversion of TEK 
enterprises and related sectors in CIS countries and other 
foreign states to joint-stock companies will also be encouraged. 
  As market relations develop, the privatization of existing 
TEK enterprises, carried out in conformity with federal and 
regional privatization programs, and the establishment of new 
private and joint-stock structures will be of ever greater 
importance. 
  At the same time, the state, through the Russian 
Mintopenergo 
[Ministry of Fuel and Energy], exercises control over the 
efficiency of the use of production funds and natural resources 
in the energy complex regardless of the forms of ownership of 
the managing entities. 
  By granting specific advantages to small and medium-sized 
business, the state will simultaneously encourage the formation 
of large, integrated power companies encompassing the various 
stages of the production, conversion and distribution of energy 
resources and will render support to the forming of 
transregional structures, especially oil and gas ones, which 
provide an entry for Russian capital into the world market. 
  Along with the establishment of economic structures right in 
the TEK sectors, the state ensures the formation of the 
corresponding enterprises and organizations of the market 
infrastructures (banks, exchanges, insurance innovation 
companies, consulting, marketing and forecasting firms and 
others). 
  During the conversion to joint-stock companies and the 
privatization of TEK enterprises, the state will not permit the 
establishment of new monopoly structures in the sphere of the 
fuel and energy supply, ensuring at the same time that the unity 
of technologically associated enterprises is maintained. 
  As a result of denationalization, conditions will be created 
for fuel and energy consumers for selecting the most 
advantageous energy suppliers, who will be competing among 
themselves in the domestic market. 
  The Energy Strategy provides for the promotion of investment 
processes. It will be achieved, first and foremost, through the 
creation of favorable fiscal and economic conditions for the 
self-financing of TEK enterprises while society's costs for the 
energy supply are minimized (thanks to competition). 
  To this end, the practice of using accelerated depreciation 
of capital stock will be introduced, the procedures of which 
will be regulated precisely. 
  In view of the limited opportunities of the investment 
complex during the transition period, the state, first of all, 
will create favorable conditions for concentrating the efforts 
of the machine-building industries and the construction and 
installation organizations in the direction of massive retooling 
of the existing TEK enterprises (tax breaks and preferential 
investment credits). This will ensure a reduction in the time 
frames for modernization and will make it possible to increase 
the needed construction starts for new energy installations. 
  The priority given to the widespread retooling of TEK 
enterprises will be maintained up to the year 2000. 
  At the same time, the construction will be continued, in 
optimum proportions, of new energy capacities needed, including 
those for maintaining the scientific, technical and skill 
potential of the related sectors of domestic machine building, 
metallurgy and the construction base. Maintaining and developing 
this potential will make it possible to ensure proper 
development of the TEK and the entire Russian economy. 
  In order to develop new production capacities and large 
deposits of energy resources, the state will encourage the 
expansion of the circle of investors in the TEK through the 
accumulation of the funds of domestic and foreign consumers of 
fuel and energy and of the public through the establishment of 
non-budget-controlled and special-purpose federal sectorial and 
regional funds and investment companies. 
  The attracting of investors of other forms of ownership in 
order to finance state programs on terms economically attractive 
for them will become the state's primary task. 
  The basic forms of state incentives for and assistance 
rendered to non-state investors in the realization of these 
programs will be: 
  -- the direct proportional participation of the state in the 
development of industries needed by society and, in particular, 
the granting of up to 25-40 percent of the preferential state 
investment credit to the private investor or direct state 
capital investments; 
  -- the full or partial exemption of these investors from the 
capital investments tax and the value-added tax; 
  -- and a tax exemption during the first 3-4 years of 
operation of new enterprises and industries. 
  Based on the extent of the development of market relations, 
the relationship between the three basic sources of financing of 
investments in the TEK will also change; the role of budget 
resources will decrease, while the share of the financial 
resources of the TEK enterprises and outside resources will 
increase. Roughly speaking, the share of the latter two may 
reach 70-80 percent by the end of the period in question. 
  In all instances, the centralized investment resources will 
be allocated based on the principles of return, efficiency and 
special-purpose use. 
  With the exception of special instances, the state 
guarantees 
various investment opportunities for domestic and foreign 
investors. 
  The set of incentives and conditions for energy conservation 
and increasing efficiency in the use of energy is necessary for 
the realization of the enormous potential of energy savings in 
Russia --around 500 million metric tons of equivalent fuel or 40 
percent of the current energy consumption. Depending on the 
intensity of energy conservation, Russia's need for energy may 
either double or remain at the existing level right up to 2010 
with a twofold increase in the standard of living for the 
country's populace. 
  The world experience of the last few decades has shown that 
intensification of energy conservation is impossible without a 
repeated increase in energy prices. The new price policy 
provides that domestic prices should come radically closer to 
world prices and thereby create the main incentive for energy 
savings. 
  But that same world experience testifies to the inadequacy 
of 
just price incentives for the pursuit of an effective 
energy-conserving policy. Needed are additional economic and 
purely standard measures, as well as a lot of informational and 
promotional work so that energy conservation would replace 
energy wastefulness as the overall living style of society. A 
correct price policy and the capable use of the entire set of 
named measures will make it possible, by the year 2000, to 
realize no less than half of the available energy conservation 
potential and to use it fully within economically efficient 
limits by 2007-2010. 
  Being drafted and put together is a Russian Energy Code, a 
new set of standard and legislative acts. Its basic document 
will be the Russian Federation Law on a Fundamental Federal 
Energy Policy (Fundamental Legislation), in which the authority 
and responsibility of the federal and regional organs in matters 
of the shaping and realization of the Energy Strategy will be 
defined precisely, the role of the state in the development and 
management of the TEK will be spelled out and the basic statutes 
on the energy market will be defined. 
  The set of acts will include the laws: 
  -- on mineral resources, 
  -- on oil and gas, 
  -- on energy conservation and the efficient use of fuel and 
energy, 
  -- on electric power engineering, 
  -- on the use of nuclear energy, 
  -- on the use of non-traditional types of energy, 
  -- on the ecological safety of TEK installations, 
  -- on labor protection and safety in the coal industry and 
others. 
  Needed in addition to the Energy Code are refinement and 
adjustment of the general economic legislation with respect to 
the special features of the TEK's activities. 
  The individual standard decisions, which reinforce the 
Strategy's statutes and mechanisms, in conformity with the 
authority provided by the Federative Agreement, will be adopted 
by edicts of the Russian President, decrees of the Russian 
Government and legislative acts of the Russian Federation's 
entities. 
<H5>  V. Russia's Energy Balance </H5>
  The opportunities for the development of the fuel and 
energy sectors have been shaped on the condition that the needs 
for basic energy resources for Russia's regions, as well as the 
exporting needs, will be satisfied. 
  The oil production forecasts for the short term are being 
determined by the time frames for overcoming the investment 
crisis and the shortage of equipment (which is directly 
associated with the real liberalization of petroleum product 
prices and the creation of a favorable climate for foreign 
investments), while those for the long term are being determined 
by the competitiveness of Russian oil in the world market, which 
depends, in particular, on the dynamics of the world oil prices. 
  The most optimistic forecasts for the development of oil and 
condensate production foresee an end to its decrease in 1995 
(315 million metric tons) with a subsequent increase up to 325 
million metric tons by 2000 and 340 million metric tons by 2010 
-- proceeding based on the efficiency of Russian oil given the 
high levels of world prices. More restrained assessments predict 
a continuation of the oil production slump until 1996 (280 
million metric tons), a moderate increase by 2000 (up to 310 
million metric tons) and a small increase with subsequent 
stabilization at a relatively low level (320 million metric 
tons) until the end of the period in question -- in the instance 
of low world oil prices. 
  Liquid distillates obtained during the production and 
processing of natural gas will make a larger and larger 
contribution to Russia's oil balance, while the national 
economy's motor fuel supply will be obtained to an ever greater 
extent through the intensification of oil refining. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-042-30A>      Natural Gas Exporting in Billions of Cubic Meters </FIG>


  The dynamics of coal mining up to the start of the next 
century will be determined by the degree of success in the 
formation of new economic and fiscal relations in this sector. A 
key question will be the level of the state-regulated prices for 
natural gas -- coal's basic competitor among the greater portion 
of consumers. If the policy followed up till now of artificially 
understating gas prices is maintained for several more years, 
then the coal industry in the overwhelming majority of Russia's 
regions will not be able to exist without large state subsidies, 
i.e., it will be doomed to a low level of efficiency and, 
consequently, a continuing production slump with a "postponed" 
increase in unemployment and a heightening of social tension. 
Coal mining in the country, based on this version, will decrease 
to 300 million metric tons in 1996 and will increase to a mere 
310 million metric tons by 2000. 
  If, however, gas prices are rapidly brought into line with 
world prices within the framework of a financial stabilization 
policy, then, the market prices for coal will rise 
correspondingly and the majority of coal enterprises will be 
able to provide the necessary self-financing of investments in 
the renovation and development of production. This will make it 
possible, by 1995, to stabilize and then to increase coal mining 
up to 320 million metric tons by 2000. 
  The subsequent dynamics of coal mining will, to a 
significant 
extent, be determined by the successes in the development of 
ecologically acceptable technologies for using coal and 
developing the Kansko-Achinsk Coal Basin. Decisive here, as 
before, is the matter of coal's competitiveness with natural 
gas, but, because of the ecological problems' importance, it 
will be perceived through the pace of the development of new 
technologies for mining and using coal. Given the successful 
development of domestic technologies or the large-scale use of 
foreign technologies, coal mining may increase up to 345 million 
metric tons in 2010 (the high version). If these processes are 
delayed, large-scale development of the Kansko-Achinsk Basin 
will go beyond the limits of the period in question and coal 
mining in 2010 will not exceed 325 million metric tons. 
  Gas prices will also determine to a significant extent the 
prospects for developing nuclear power engineering. The total 
capacity of the AESs, after its decrease to 15-17 gigawatts in 
1997-1999, will then increase by 2010 up to 30-33 gigawatts in 
the optimistic version of the development of nuclear power 
engineering and up to 22-24 gigawatts in the moderate version. 
  The use of renewable energy sources -- traditional (water 
power and wood) and non-traditional -- will increase throughout 
the entire period in question, reaching 100 million metric tons 
of equivalent fuel by 2010 in the optimistic version and 65 
million metric tons of equivalent fuel in the moderate version. 
But, in all instances, these energy sources, just like nuclear 
energy, will not be able to exert decisive influence on the 
stability and efficiency in meeting the country's domestic needs 
for energy and the exporting needs. 
  The gas industry will be the main means for solving these 
problems throughout the entire period in question. Based on the 
results of the optimization of Russia's energy balance 
regionally, the needed volumes of gas production amount to 
650-655 billion cubic meters in 1995, 715-730 billion cubic 
meters in 2000 and 785-820 billion cubic meters in 2010. At the 
same time, the development of the gas industry is in line with 
the traditional directions for the gasification of the national 
economy. Under the new conditions, a policy of more intensive 
gasification of the national economy with the development of new 
markets for natural gas and an increase in the efficient use of 
gas among traditional consumers is economically justified and 
should be pursued. 
  Electric power engineering is the heart of Russia's energy 
complex, meeting the needs of the national economy with the most 
ecologically clean and adptable energy resource. Electricity 
production in Russia, after dropping to 940 billion 
kilowatt-hours in 1995-1996, will increase up to 1,040-1,050 
billion kilowatt-hours in 2000 and up to 1,270-1,300 billion 
kilowatt-hours in 2010. It is precisely in electric power 
engineering that there will be the fullest realization of the 
interchangeability and competition of all types of fuel (its 
expenditure will decrease from 370 million metric tons of 
equivalent fuel in 1992 to 345 million metric tons of equivalent 
fuel in 1995, then be restored by 2000 and increase up to 
415-420 million metric tons of equivalent fuel by 2010) among 
one another and with other energy resources -- nuclear energy 
and water power and non-traditional energy sources. 
  The national economy's centralized heating specifically for 
Russia's energy complex also performs in it the same integrating 
functions as electric power engineering. Determining the 
efficient levels for centralizing the heat supply (while a 
market economy creates additional incentives for 
decentralization) and efficient scales for power and heat 
generation (the combined production of heat and electricity) has 
become the main task of the optimization of the national 
economy's heat supply. 
  Inasmuch as more than 35 percent of all the energy resources 
consumed in Russia goes for heating needs, then another task 
(closely associated with the stated ones) is the selection of 
optimum combinations in using the various types of fuel and 
nuclear and non-traditional energy sources for heating needs. 
  Thus, the new structural policy for energy resource 
production for the next 15-20 years envisions keeping organic 
fuel as the foundation of Russia's fuel and energy balance. 
<H5>  VI. Russian Energy Diplomacy </H5>
  The TEK's most important task is restoring its 
positions in the world energy market, in volumes which meet the 
objective efficiency of Russian energy resources, and raising 
the country's economy and the prosperity of the populace. 
  Doing this will be very complicated after the loss of the 
oil 
markets and part of the gas markets in the countries of Eastern 
Europe and the Baltics because of the decrease in world oil 
prices and the strong competition in the European gas markets. 
  The analysis of and forecast for the energy markets of 
Europe 
and the Far East show that, in the foreseeable future, the 
exporting of energy resources from Russia will not exceed 85 
percent of the maximum 1988 level given a scenario of low energy 
consumption and 65 percent given an enhanced scenario. 
  In contrast to the USSR, which was the world's largest 
exporter of energy resources, but which used the enormous 
currency revenues to support military confrontation under the 
conditions of a "closed" economy, Russia should promote to the 
maximum extent the integration of the domestic economy into 
world economic relations. 
  On the one hand, this signifies a need to reconcile domestic 
and world prices for energy resources and other types of 
products (and, of course, the wage levels) and, on the other 
hand, opportunities for the widespread access of foreign 
investments (together with technologies and methods for 
organizing operations) to the development of our energy 
resources, including for the needs of exporting. 
  Both these features will radically change the attitude 
toward 
the assessment of the efficiency of exporting projects, 
replacing the former policy of "obtaining currency at any price 
" with careful economic bases for each project, regardless of 
the extent to which its products go for exporting. 
  In this way, real economic obstacles to the squandering of 
Russia's natural resources will be set up, instead of paper 
obstacles. 
  Forecasting efficient scales for energy resource exporting 
requires a careful analysis of Russia's possible role in the 
basic energy markets. 
  In the world oil market, even during the years of its 
largest 
exporting (more than 200 million metric tons in 1988), the USSR 
did not manage to have a serious influence on the economic 
market conditions. Moreover, this will be hard to do for Russia, 
which will not be able to distribute beyond the borders of the 
CIS more than 60-70 million metric tons of oil and petroleum 
products right up to the year 2000 and up to 100 million metric 
tons during the subsequent period. 
  This is why, given the forecast for the effective volumes of 
Russian oil's participation in the world market, it is possible 
to consider its capacity within the stated limits to be 
unlimited and the price of oil as not depending on the amounts 
of Russian exporting. 
  As a consequence of an increase in the world prices for oil 
and, what is the main thing, the shift to trading energy 
resources with the CIS countries at world prices, the earnings 
from exporting Russian oil may reach the 1990 level by 1995 and 
exceed it by 10-75 percent in 2000 and by a factor of 1.6-2.8 by 
2010. 
  The net profit of Russian enterprises and the state (through 
taxes, royalty payments and customs fees) from oil exporting, 
defined as the difference between the earnings from its sale at 
world prices and the production expenditures (capital and 
current), is estimated to be $20-35 billion in 1996-2000 and 
$70-100 billion in the next decade. 
  In the world gas markets, in contrast to the oil market, 
Russia can and should play an active role. By providing 35 
percent of the world exporting of natural gas, Russia will have 
substantial influence on the market conditions of the European 
market and establish a Far East market for pipeline gas. The 
opportunities for Russia's entry into the world market for 
condensed natural gas (SPG) also need to be studied. 
  Forecasts of the World Energy Council, the European Energy 
Agency and other international organizations envision an 
increase in the share of natural gas in the consumption of 
primary energy resources in Europe in the first few decades of 
the 21st Century up to 22 percent. The possibilities of 
satisfying Europe's demand for natural gas using domestic 
production will decrease by 2010 from 66 percent to 44 percent. 
Russia's basic "internal" competitors in the European market are 
Norway and the Netherlands, while, over time, the role of the 
former will nearly double and that of the latter will be cut in 
half. The promotion of Norwegian gas to the European market is 
being carried out by the state and monopolistic structures of 
Western Europe for both economic and political considerations, 
restraining the entry of Russian gas into this market. 
Nevertheless, the volumes of gas production at Norway's new 
fields can be viewed as a target for competition from and 
replacement by Russian gas. 
  Of the natural gas deliveries which are "external" for 
Europe, a notable role is played by Algeria's gas, the exporting 
of which is increasing for existing and new contracts and may, 
in the future, reach 80-90 billion cubic meters per year, but a 
large portion of this volume does not enter the area of 
competition of Russian gas. 
  Iran, which has the largest gas resources after the CIS, is 
also contemplating beginning exporting gas to Europe. This 
assumes the construction of gas pipelines across the territory 
of Turkey or Ukraine. Russian gas will be the main competitor 
for Iranian gas. 
  During the period in question, it is possible that Nigeria 
and Qatar, where large gas fields have been discovered, will 
join the number of exporters of gas to the European market. They 
are contemplating exporting the gas in condensed form primarily 
to Mediterranean ports and probably will not be competing with 
Russian gas. 
  In the opinion of Western specialists, it is possible to be 
quite certain that existing Russian contracts will be renewed, 
although ensuring the conditions required for the Russian side 
presents a serious problem. 
  In the future, basic competition in the European market will 
be associated with the entry of "new" gas from Siberia (in 
particular, from the Yamal fields) and the Shtokmanskiy Field. 
This gas will be competing mainly with Norway's "new" gas and 
may become reserved for all of European importing. 
  In the Far East region, the gas resources of Eastern Siberia 
and Russia's Far East will make it possible to study the idea of 
establishing a system of gas pipelines into China, North Korea, 
South Korea and, possibly, to Japan. 
  According to the assessments of the MMMShM Consortium 
[McDermott, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Shell and Marathon], given the 
specified conditions, developing the Lunskiy and 
Piltun-Astokhskiy fields on the shelf of Sakhalin Island is 
economically justified both for Russia and for foreign 
investors. At the same time, the price FOB-Sakhalin is being set 
at $120-140 per thousand cubic meters (after liquefaction -- for 
transportation to Japan). There is a variation using Sakhalin 
gas over a system of cross-country gas pipelines into China, 
North Korea and South Korea. 
  Other planned developments contemplate establishing a system 
of gas pipelines through Khabarovsk from the gas fields of the 
Republic of Sakha-Yakutia or Irkutsk Oblast. With a feed of 16 
billion cubic meters of Yakut gas per year, its price in North 
Korea may amount to $110-130 per thousand cubic meters. All 
these technical and economic developments need refinement and 
serious examination. 
  The exporting of other energy resources from Russia -- 
electricity, coal and products from its processing and other 
types of fuel -- will not play as important a role as 
hydrocarbon exporting. Nevertheless, it is possible to talk 
about very large volumes. In addition, the exporting of 
electricity, especially to CIS countries and to the European 
countries, will be of essential importance from the standpoint 
of preserving the advantages of the Unified Electricity System 
on the territory of the former USSR and the former "Mir" Power 
System on a new economic basis and in the new political 
situation, as well as their expansion through the integration of 
the power systems of Western and Eastern Europe. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-042-33A>      Total Oil and Petroleum Product Exporting in Millions of Metric Tons </FIG>


  Total earnings from energy resource exporting will amount to 
$30-45 billion in 1995 and $35-55 billion in 2000. Over the 
upcoming 7-year period (up to 2000), this will ensure the 
receipt of from $230 billion to $330 billion, i.e., 3-4 times 
more than the former USSR's foreign debt, the repayment of which 
Russia has taken upon itself. 
  The profit from the exporting of energy resources from 
Russia 
will come to from 40 percent to 55 percent of the total amount 
of earnings, which, in and of themselves, will amount during the 
upcoming 7 years to 5-10 percent of the national income. Taking 
into account the positive changes in the economy's structure, 
which have been caused by the use of the advantages of the 
international division of labor, the proposed energy resource 
exporting policy will ensure an increase in the national income 
by 5-7 percent by 2000 and by another 8-12 percent by 2010. 
<H5>  VII. Ecological Safety and Developing Power Engineering </H5>
  The development of the fuel and energy complex should 
be ensured with strict observance of the environmental 
protection requirements. Inasmuch as its installations are the 
basic sources of pollution of the air and the surface and 
underground waters and the disturbance of natural landscapes and 
lands, the TEK should take upon itself the basic burden of 
solving the most important social problem --the ecological 
improvement of the country. The realization of this task will 
require significant material and financial resources and an 
integrated approach to developing and operating all the TEK's 
units. 
  Around 48 percent of the discharges of harmful substances 
into the open air, up to 36 percent of the draining of waste 
water into natural water reservoirs (including 15 percent of 
that polluted above the norm) and more than 30 percent of the 
solid wastes which occupy significant storage areas must be 
attributed to the fuel and energy enterprises. 
  The basic principle for ensuring ecological safety in the 
TEK 
will be an integrated approach to efficient fuel and energy 
resource use and conservation at all stages of their production, 
processing and consumption on the basis of progressive and 
ecologically clean technologies, including the operation of 
unified power-generating units. 
  At the same time, the output of products produced in the TEK 
is being increased, ones used as ecologically clean energy 
resources in other sectors of the national economy (low-sulfur 
fuel, high-octane unleaded gasoline, binary types of fuel, 
briquet for domestic purposes and the like). 
  A significant role in reducing environmental pollution is 
being assigned to the optimization of the fuel and energy 
balance intertwined with the structure and the placement of 
other production capacities which are sources of discharges of 
harmful substances, as well as to increasing the proportion of 
centralized heating of industrial and social installations. 
Using new furnaces and ecologically clean methods for producing 
energy will reduce the harmful impact on the environment. 
  There will be substantial improvement of the system for 
collecting, transporting and processing incidental gaseous 
products, as well as the detection, localization and elimination 
of oil leaks and spills in the producing and refining regions, 
especially under the ecologically strenuous conditions of the 
North. 
  Taking into consideration the objective orientation toward 
the preferential use of coal fuel in power engineering, the use 
of ecologically clean technologies for its mining, transporting 
and processing with compulsory use of waste material, 
reclamation of disturbed lands and restoration of the ecosystems 
is being expanded. 
  The most important strategic tasks are still the 
organization 
of integrated monitoring of the state of the environment at TEK 
installations, as well as the improvement and development of the 
legal, standard and technical base regulating the planning, 
construction, operation and removal from operation of TEK 
installations. 
  The realization of the examined directions of the 
environmental protection policy, based on forecast estimates, 
should ensure by 2010, just in electric power engineering and 
centralized heating: 
  -- a reduction by 30-40 percent in the discharges of acidic 
gases and ash into the open air; 
  -- the practical stabilization of discharges of greenhouse 
gases into the open air; 
  -- the cessation of harmful discharges; 
  -- and the almost complete stopping of the increase in the 
expropriation of lands for enterprises. 
  Envisioned during the production of oil and gas and the 
construction of facilities at oil fields are: 
  -- a shift to a system of "storehouse-free" drilling, using 
the drilling mud for constructing roads and sites for 
installations; 
  -- replacement of the existing pipelines at oil fields by 
pipelines with factory-installed interior and exterior 
insulation, which will make it possible to preclude numerous 
pipeline defects due to corrosion and to reduce sharply 
environmental pollution from oil spills; 
  -- and to reduce sharply the burning of incidental gas by a 
factor of 4-5, the volume of the burning of which currently 
amounts to something on the order of 8 billion cubic meters. 
  The realization of the basic directions of the TEK's 
ecological policy is being carried out using an integrated 
systemic approach, taking into account the specifics of the key 
moments of the TEK's development on the basis of: 
  -- a new technological strategy; 
  -- the development of an environmental protection 
infrastructure; 
  -- the improvement of the economic and organizational forms 
of management; 
  -- the establishment of step-by-step ecological norms and 
requirements and the adoption of the necessary new legislative 
acts; 
  -- a basic change in the production and administrative 
structures at both the federal and regional levels under the 
conditions of a market economy and abandonment of the 
administrative and command system of management, with a view 
toward increasing the independence of local organs of authority 
in the adoption of solutions concerning a territory's economic 
development; 
  -- and further improvement of the economic principles for 
the 
use of natural resources and the use of ecological safeguards. 
  It is contemplated that, during the planning, construction 
and operation of TEK installations, a set of steady-state 
operations be carried out, including full-scale observations and 
research, the centralized formation of a data bank and the 
distribution of real-time information. In its most complete 
form, monitoring for large TEK installations should include the 
following systems: recording of the installation's operating 
conditions (shutdowns and their causes), of observations of the 
discharges and dumping of harmful substances and of other 
negative influences, of the monitoring of the radiation 
environment of the surrounding area, of measurements of the 
variables of weather conditions and the open air (air 
temperature, inversions, wind speed and direction, atmospheric 
precipitations and the composition of the open air), of 
integrated observations in water reservoirs and channels 
(hydrometric, hydrothermal, chemical hydrology and 
hydrobiological observations) and others, 20 systems in all. 
  It is envisioned that the listed set of observations and 
research will be introduced by 2010 at all large and 
medium-sized TEK installations. 
  Over the course of 1994-1995, as a state ecological study is 
carried out, 11 standard and technical documents for the TEK's 
ecological standard base will be drafted and published. 
  Russia's Energy Strategy is not a planning and directive 
document. It is the aggregate of the priorities and mechanisms 
for the realization of a new energy policy. During its 
realization, the Strategy will be adapted to the current 
economic situation. At the same time, the prospects for the 
TEK's development will necessarily determine the most important 
directions for Russia's economic revival.

<F P=106> [Statute on The Procedure for Issuing Provisional Permits </F>
from Russian Gosatomnadzor for Construction of Nuclear Power 
Plant Units for Civilian Purposes; registered in the RF Ministry 
of Justice on 21 March 1994, Reg. No 523; approved by Order No 
26 of 9 March 1994 RD-04-07-94] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  1. General Regulations </H5>
  1.1. The issuing of provisional permits for the construction 
of nuclear power plant (AS) units for civilian purposes in the 
Russian Federation is carried out by Russian Gosatomnadzor 
[Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety] on the basis 
of the Statute on Russian Gosatomnadzor, approved by order of 
the President of the Russian Federation on 5 June 1992 No 
283-rp, with amendments approved by order of the President of 
the Russian Federation of 16 September 1993, No 636-rp. 
  1.2. This Statute on the procedure for issuing provisional 
permits from Russian Gosatomnadzor for construction of nuclear 
power plant units for civilian purposes (henceforth called the 
Statute) establishes the procedure for obtaining and 
accompanying a provisional permit for construction of AS units 
and is in force during the transitional period until the Statute 
on the procedure for issuing licenses for the construction of 
nuclear power plants goes into effect. 
  1.3. The statute applies to the construction of AS units on 
Russian Federation territory. 
  1.4. The provisional permit of Russian Gosatomnadzor for the 
construction of an AS unit is an official document, which: 
  --permits the construction of a specific AS unit; 
  --establishes the conditions under which the construction of 
the unit is permitted. 
  1.5. A provisional permit for construction is issued by 
Russian Gosatomnadzor individually for each AS unit. 
  1.6. This Statute also applies to facilities (RAO, KhOYaT 
[chemical weapons and nuclear equipment] and other storages), 
the construction of which on the territory of existing AS is 
carried out according to individual itemized lists. 
  1.7. The issue of a provisional permit for construction of 
AS 
units begun before this Statute was introduced is based on: 
  --the fact of acknowledgement by Russian Gosatomnadzor of 
earlier issued documents permitting construction of AS units; 
  --carrying out an evaluation of the safety of an AS unit, 
including the conditions of its location, on the basis of an 
examination of the documents submitted to justify the 
application; 
  --making the necessary inspections; 
  --establishing the conditions for the functioning of the 
provisional permit.

<F P=106> [Report by the Auditing Directorate for the Administration </F>
of the Russian Federation President: "`Ostankino' Is Selling 
Itself, Continuously Lowering the Price"] 
  [Text] In 1993, the expenses of the RGTRK [Russian State 
Television and Radio Company] "Ostankino" were financed by the 
Russian Ministry of Finance from the Russian Federation Budget 
for the sum of 103.7 billion rubles [R]; of this amount, R82.8 
billion, or 80 percent, were used to pay for the services of the 
Russian Ministry of Communications and R20.9 billion were spent 
for its own needs. As of the beginning of 1994, the company owed 
R50.3 billion to state enterprises which provide for 
dissemination and retransmission of radio and television 
programs and R1.8 billion to the Television Technical Center 
(TTTs). 
  At the same time, despite its difficult financial situation 
(...) it continues to use budgetary funds for unauthorized 
purposes. 
  Because of the lack of appropriate supervision by the 
management of the RGTRK "Ostankino" (the former chairman V.I. 
Bragin), individual television studios illegally permitted an 
increase in the volume of broadcasting established for them last 
year (...). 
  Television and radio advertising, which is one of the 
company's principal sources of commercial income, is being 
broadcast practically without supervision. The Main Commercial 
Advertising Board was established only in May 1993. 
  There were cases in 1993 in which subunits were given 
budgetary appropriations without accounting for the funds they 
received from commercial activity. Thus, the Television 
Program Board was allocated R38 million at the same time that 
the studio's expenses were covered in full by the incomes 
received from advertising activity. Some R21 million were 
allocated without justification to the "Radio Podmoskovya" 
studio as well. A spot check at five studios established that 
the unpaid placement of advertising in 1992 added up to R45 
million. In 1993, the liabilities totaled R441 million. 
  Incomes from commercial activity in 1993 amounted to R11.2 
billion, although according to the expert assessment of the 
sociological center of the RGTRK "Ostankino," the company 
should have received no less than R60 billion in profit from 
airing advertising alone. This estimate is confirmed by a 
check made of activity following the purchase of a license to 
air television serials in exchange for advertising time. 
  Estimates show that the RGTRK "Ostankino" could have 
received 
nearly R1.3 billion from the contract signed 16 February 1993 by 
the company's acting director, I.Ye. Malashenko, with the 
"Premyer SV" Advertising Agency for collaboration in purchasing 
the rights to broadcast the television serial "Twin Peaks" from 
the World Vision Company and to organize its showing on the 
RGTRK channel (we will return to this in our concluding 
remarks--NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA [NYeG]). This agency was 
granted 120 minutes of advertising time, without the appropriate 
economic accounting, for all 30 series of the film, which 
amounts to a minimum of about R596 million when the total cost 
of hiring the film was R159 million. Moreover, the "Premyer 
SV" was given the exclusive right to select and place 
advertising in the time belonging to the company (180 minutes) 
with a 30-percent discount from the estimates; as a result of 
this, the agency was provided with additional income totaling 
R273 million. In 1993, some 27 minutes of the company's 
advertising time were not used during the course of the 
contract's implementation through the fault of the "Premyer SV." 
However, demands were immediately made by the "Premyer SV" 
Advertising Agency for an additional 69 minutes of advertising 
time for the television serial's transfer to other time periods 
during the election campaign, and this can bring it an income on 
the order of R393 million. Despite the fact that this violation 
was called "force majeure" circumstances (the circumstances were 
favorable!--NYeG), because it was necessary to comply with the 
Russian Federation President's Edict No. 1792 of 29 October 
1993, the company met the agency's demand without reservation. 
Moreover, it paid R57 million for the services of the Russian 
Ministry of Communications for the advertising time actually 
used. (Something else would have been strange: if the 
advertising agencies were to bear responsibility for the 
president's actions--NYeG). 
  With the connivance of the RGTRK "Ostankino" management, the 
activity of commercial enterprises and institutions has been 
neglected by the company's subunits. As of the beginning of 
1994, founders have not had data at their disposal on the number 
of enterprises and the payments made to their charter funds. The 
company is not receiving income from the activity of commercial 
structures. 
  During the audit of the RGTRK "Ostankino," the "VID" 
Television Company, the "Intervid" Corporation, the Television 
Technical Center, the "Vzglyad," "Telekanal 2x2," TV "Servis," 
"Sodeystviye," and a number of other enterprises directly 
connected with television and radio broadcasting which 
collaborate with the company were checked as well. 
  It was established that individual enterprises owe the 
company for payment of services, and cases of nonpayment of 
taxes were revealed as well. In accordance with the laws in 
force, they have been charged additionally for payments to the 
budget of R1.1 billion. 
  The court examination of the suit involving V.I. Bragin, 
former chairman of the RGTRK "Ostankino," has continued for 
nearly a year. At the same time, several judicial decisions have 
been made by the Higher Arbitration Court. At the present time, 
the statement registering a protest has been recalled by the 
company's acting chairman, A.N. Yakovlev. The dispute continues 
to be unsettled... (There is no question that the authors of the 
report are much more competent than the court. This is a 
customary privilege of those close to the president. Further 
details in concluding remarks--NYeG.) 
  It has been established that some contracts not only do not 
protect the company's economic interests, they are simply not 
advantageous for it. Thus, a contract was signed on 7 October 
1993 by the RGTRK "Ostankino" Studio for Children's and Young 
People's Programs with the closed-type joint-stock company 
"INMAK" and the Association to Promote the Development of 
Children's Television (a limited partnership) to show publicity 
subjects of the "INMAK" AO [Joint-Stock Company]. In this case, 
the funds for airing the advertising should be transferred to 
the current account of the association, which is not part of the 
company's structure. 
  A contract signed on 12 July 1993 between the RGTRK 
"Ostankino" (former Deputy Chairman Yu.N. Bandura) and the 
"Jeronimo, Ltd." Firm for collaboration in purchasing the rights 
to show films from television companies in West Europe and the 
United States, as well as in organizing their showing on the 
company's channels, provides for the income from advertising to 
go into the foreign firm's current account. 
  In conformity with the "Supplement to the Gentlemen's 
Agreement" made on 24 July 1993 by former RGTRK "Ostankino" 
Deputy Chairman Yu.N. Bandura and Mr. (I. Amors), president of 
the "Ostankino Development" Enterprise, 100 minutes of 
advertising time are transferred to the company from this 
enterprise at a price of $3,000 [presumably: per minute]. So the 
enterprise sold the company a "commodity" which it did not 
officially have at its disposal. Nevertheless, at the 
instruction of the former managers of the RGTRK "Ostankino" 
(V.I. Bragin and Yu.N. Bandura), the company transferred 
$300,000 to the account of this enterprise in October 1993. 
  In 1993 the RGTRK "Ostankino" (former Chairman V.I. Bragin) 
signed a contract with the "Kamaka" TOO [Limited Partnership] 
for the firm's transcription of television materials and their 
subsequent sale of the right to show them to commercial 
television companies. In the period from July to December 1993, 
the "Kamaka" TOO transferred 360 cassettes to the company 
containing 432 programs, of which 382 were taken from the 
Gosteleradiofond [USSR State Committee for Television and Radio 
Broadcasting Holdings]. For this work, the firm received R25 
million, that is, the funds were spent for transcribing programs 
already existing in the state's holdings. The company has not 
received any income from this contract to date. 
  The RGTRK "Ostankino" has received no profit from a 
transaction concluded in 1992 with the American corporation 
"U.S.S.U. Arts Group," which was granted the exclusive right to 
use recordings of classical music stored in the archives of the 
Gosteleradiofond (incidentally, the transaction was also 
concluded by Yu. Bandura!--NYeG). 
  A founding contract has not been concluded yet between the 
Russian Federation Government and the RGTRK "Ostankino" to 
regulate relationships between the founder and the company, as 
stipulated by the Statute on the Russian State Television and 
Radio Company "Ostankino" and confirmed by the Russian 
Federation President's Edict No. 421 of 2 April 1992 "On 
guarantees to stabilize the information and activity of the 
Russian State Television and Radio Company "Ostankino." The lack 
of a unified concept in the field of state television and radio 
broadcasting has led to the point that orientation of the 
company's activity has been defined chiefly by the position of 
its managers, seldom by the broadcast studios themselves. (So 
that's where the problem lies!--especially with respect to Ye. 
Yakovlev and "VID"--NYeG.) 
<H8>  From the NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA Editorial Staff </H8>
  Tha anonymous authors of the report, who gave a good 
account of themselves at the start by identifying the completely 
obvious problems of "Ostankino," fulfilled a social and 
political order at the same time, in our view. Those Ostankino 
characters who have been the most free in their judgments have 
been the subject of administrative wrath first of all--the ones 
from "VID" (we may wonder if the auditors were unaware of the 
damage inflicted on "VID" by Bragin's excommunication of its 
leaders), Yegor Yakovlev (The court decisions are of no concern 
at all to the inspectors. They found in themselves the strength 
and the right to declare him "illegal.") Of course, Malashenko 
must be given a pat as well--the NTV which he heads is much more 
liberal and talented than the official "Ostankino." And at the 
same time, outside the limits of the report, which we are 
publishing with certain abridgments, there is the reckless 
private business of the technical employees, the fantastic 
dimensions of "indirect advertising," and the studio corruption 
leading to ordered slaughters. And most importantly, there is no 
attempt made to explain why it was to the advantage of Bragin 
and K [presumably: the company] to decentralize advertising and 
close their eyes to Mr. Bandura's transactions.

<H5>  Prices for Consumer Goods and Services </H5>
  Over the period 15 to 22 March 1994 prices for consumer 
goods 
and services rose by 2.1 percent, including for foodstuffs--by 
1.4 percent, nonfood items--by 2.8 percent, and for-fee services 
for the population--by 3.5 percent. The highest rate of 
increases in prices for goods and services was registered in the 
Far Eastern and East Siberian economic regions (about 3 
percent), and the lowest--in West Siberian and Central Chernozem 
regions (1.3 percent). 
  Indices of prices for consumer goods and services were as 
follows (as a percentage of the preceding observation date): 


                 03/05       03/15       03/22       Average daily price rise

services for 
the population 



  Over 22 days of March prices for goods and services 
increased 
by 6.3 percent (by 41.3 percent since the beginning of the 
year), including those for foodstuffs--by 4.6 percent (38.6 
percent), nonfood items--by 7.6 percent (33.1 percent), and 
for-fee services for the population--by 12.3 percent (2.2-fold). 
  Assuming that the current pace of price rises remains the 
same until the end of the month, the total rise in prices for 
goods and service in March will be about 10 percent. 
  Foodstuffs. Over the period 15 to 22 March prices 
in organized and nonorganized trade rose by 1.5 percent and 0.9 
percent. 
  Price changes by main categories of food products are shown 
below (as a percentage of the preceding observation date): 


                     Total           including: 

                                     in organized        in nonorganized

vegetables 


  In organized trade over the period 15 to 22 March vegetable 
prices rose at an anticipatory rate: garlic--by 11 percent, 
carrots and fresh cabbage--by 8 percent, and beets and 
potatoes--by 4 percent. A high rate of prices increases remained 
with respect to bread and bakery products, cereals, cheeses, 
frozen fish, and salt (4-7 percent). There has been practically 
no change over the week in prices for meat, vegetable oil, 
sugar, eggs, and vodka. 
  Since the beginning of the month vegetable prices have gone 
up by 17 percent, bread and bakery products--by 13 percent, milk 
products--by 9 percent, and meat and meat products--by 4 percent. 
  Similar to organized trade, the greatest price increases in 
nonorganized trade were registered with respect to fresh 
produce: prices for fresh cabbage, onions, and carrots went up 
by 6-9 percent. Prices for meat and milk products remained 
practically unchanged. Since the beginning of the month 
vegetable prices have increased by 13 percent, milk products--5 
percent, and meat--3 percent. 
  The cost of the consumer basket of 19 basic foodstuffs 
increased over the week by 1.5 percent and as of 22 March 
amounted to 43,700 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly basis. 
The price differential between monitored cities measured a 
factor of 3.9. In terms of the cost of consumer basket Moscow 
and St. Petersburg ranked 34th and 36th among 132 monitored 
cities (R47,700 and R47,600 on a monthly basis). 
  Nonfood items. Prices for basic medicines 
increased over the week by 5 percent; those for light industry 
products--by 2-3 percent, and tobacco items--by 1.4 percent. 
  Since the beginning of the month prices for medicines have 
increased by 14 percent; garments, knitwear, and fabrics--by 7-9 
percent; footwear--by 5 percent; and tobacco items--by 3.5 
percent. 
  For-fee services for the population. The trend of 
anticipatory rate increases with respect to for-fee services 
continued over the period under review. The cost of city bus 
fares increased by 10.9 percent. In Astrakhan, Novgorod, Ukhta, 
and Moscow they jumped over the week by a factor of two to 2.5. 
The cost of some categories of consumer and municipal services 
went up by 2-6 percent. There was a considerable increase in the 
cost of municipal services in Yakutsk, where apartment rents 
increased 1.5-fold, electric and gas rates--threefold, and hot 
water rates--more than fivefold. 
  Since the beginning of the month the greatest rate increases 
have been registered with respect to municipal housing and hot 
water (1.7-fold) and city bus fares (by 22 percent). Fees for 
certain categories of health care services and visits to 
sanitariums and resorts increased by 7-10 percent. 
  Industrial production. Over 20 days of March 1994, 
of 163 most important categories of products counted in periodic 
reports, the average daily production, 
  as compared to the corresponding period of 1993: 
  --increased with respect to 13 items, (including city 
telephone cables, polypropylene, potassium fertilizer, 
asbestos-cement pipes and couplers, cotton fabrics, school 
notebooks, pencils, high fat-content cheeses and feta cheese, 
and facial soap), or 8 percent of the total number; 
  --decreased with respect to 145 items, or 89 percent of the 
total number; 
  as compared to the corresponding period of February 1994: 
  --increased with respect to 59 items, (including automotive 
gasoline, diesel fuel, pig iron, steel, finished rolled metal, 
coking coal, sulfuric acid, mineral fertilizer, calcinated soda, 
synthetic ammonia, polystyrene, processing control panels, 
traveling electric cranes, passenger railcars, excavators, 
automobiles, buses, tractors, lumber, cardboard, roof slate, 
high-grade asbestos, asbestos-cement pipes and couplers, 
decorative ceramic tile, video tape recorders, knitting 
machines, motorcycles, linen fabrics and sack cloth, raincoats, 
suits, footwear, meat, butter, high fat-content cheeses and feta 
cheese, and canned milk products), or 36 percent of the total 
number; 
  --decreased with respect to 99 items, or 61 percent of the 
total number; 
  Based on the dynamics of the production of most important 
varieties of industrial output, it is estimated that the average 
daily production in industry over the elapsed period of March 
1994 amounted to 73 percent of that for the corresponding period 
of March last year. 
  The output of the main categories of industrial products 
over 
20 days of March 1994 is characterized by the following data: 


                           Produced over     As % of the corresponding period 
                           20 days of        (in terms of average daily 
                           March 1994        production) of

  Over the elapsed period of March 1994 there was no

of gantry cranes with lifting capacity of eight or more tonnes, 
grain-and flax-harvesting combines, and electric locomotives. 
  Progress in Defense Industry Conversion. In 1993 
conversion measures were being implemented at 716 enterprises of 
the Russian Federation defense complex, which comprises 98 
percent of all enterprises with defense contracts. 
  Production cutbacks were typical in 1993 both for industry 
as 
a whole and for enterprises undergoing conversion, as may be 
seen from the following data: 


                        1993 as % of 1992

  Under the influence of conversion processes, the share of 
military products in total output dropped from 52 percent in 
1990 to 31 percent in 1993. The change in the structure of 
output and number of employees engaged in this production may be 
seen from the following data (in percentages):

  Wages at enterprises undergoing conversion were lower than 
in 
industry overall and in 1993 amounted on average to R44,000 per 
month (in industry--R66,000 per month, including in machine 
building--R47,000). In 1993, 165,000 persons quit their jobs at 
enterprises undergoing conversion. The number of personnel 
engaged in industrial production at enterprises undergoing 
conversion fell over the year by 12 percent, which is somewhat 
higher than in machine-building (by 10 percent), and twice as 
high as industry as a whole. 
  As in the rest of industry, the financial situation of 
enterprises undergoing conversion in 1993 was typically 
unstable. The amount of money owed by consumers for products 
purchased from these enterprises reached R1.2 trillion; of that, 
more than half was owed to them by the state. In turn, past due 
payments owed by enterprises undergoing conversion to suppliers 
for raw materials, parts, and components amounted to R854 
billion. 
  There were no substantial changes in the structure of 
financing of conversion measures in 1993. The share of money 
provided from the federal budget amounted to, according to data 
supplied by enterprises undergoing conversion, 21 percent of all 
expenditures, as compared to 24 percent in 1992. The share of 
outside sources of money in conversion financing has increased 
(from 41 percent to 44 percent). This is mostly bank loans; the 
share of money received from foreign investors is extremely 
small (0.3 percent of all means received from outside sources). 
The share of self-financing of conversion measures in 1993 
remained at the 1992 level and amounted on average over the year 
to 18 percent, although in the first quarter of 1993 it reached 
29 percent. 
  In 1993 the destination of 18 percent of the output produced 
by enterprises undergoing conversion was outside Russia; 
military equipment and arms accounted for one-third of this 
output. 
  Operation of Urban Electric Transportation. In the 
Russian Federation, 113 cities have electric urban passenger 
transport; of them, 27 have only streetcars; 43--only trolley 
buses; and 43 have both. Six cities have subways. 
  The production base of urban electric transport and the 
passenger volume they carry are characterized by the following 
data:

--by subway                 3,567            4,212            118 


  In 1993, 13.9 km of streetcar track (one-way) were put into 
operation (one-third less than in 1992) and 103 km of trolley 
bus lines (2.1 times more). Additions to trolley bus lines were 
made in 17 cities, including Orenburg (21 km), St. Petersburg 
(14.0 km), Kemerovo (13.0 km), Kazan (12.8 km), Irkutsk (10.7 
km), and Perm (9.8 km); to streetcar tracks--in eight cities, 
including Vladivostok (5.5 km), Prokopyevsk (3.8 km), and 
Chelyabinsk (2.2 km). 
  The operating length of subway track increased in 1993 by 
5.6 
km, which is 1.5 times less than in 1992. New segments were put 
into operation on the Samara (3 km) and Nizhniy Novgorod (2.6 
km) subways. 
  In 1993 urban electric transport enterprises received 498 
streetcars and 1,341 trolley buses, which is somewhat higher 
than 1992 deliveries. At the same time, the wear and tear on 
rolling stock remains high. Currently more 10 percent of all 
trolley buses and streetcars in Russia have exceeded the term of 
their useful life. 
  In Kaliningrad, 71 percent of streetcars have been in 
service 
for 15 or more years; in Volgograd, Samara, Vladikavkaz, and 
Izhevsk--more than 50 percent; and in Ulyanovsk, Pyatigorsk, 
Salavat, Yekaterinburg, and Komsomolsk-na-Amure--more than 40 
percent. 
  In Leninsk-Kuznetsk more than 50 percent of trolley buses 
have exceeded their normal service term; in Arkhangelsk, 
Yoshkar-Ola, Novocheboksarsk, Astrakhan, Balakovo, Nalchik, 
Rostov-na-Donu, Taganrog, Sterlitamak, Kurgan, Berezniki, 
Abakan, Bratsk, Chita, and Kaliningrad--more than 20 percent. 
  In the subways rolling stock inventory, 32 percent of cars 
have been in service between 15 and 25 years, and 13 percent of 
cars--for more than 25 years. There are 247 cars (6 percent) in 
Moscow subway that have served their useful life (more than 30 
years). 
  As a result, the main cause of off-line idling of rolling 
stock are technical malfunctions. 
  In 1993 on average 28.6 percent of trolley buses a day were 
not in use, of which 18.5 percent were under repair or awaiting 
repair; with respect to streetcars these figures amounted to 
26.9 percent and 20.5 percent respectively; and subways--24 
percent and 10 percent. 
  More than 30 percent of trolley buses a day on average were 
not in use due to repairs or the need for such in Volgograd, 
Maykop, Cherkessk, Vladikavkaz, Volgodonsk, Berezniki, and 
Novokuznetsk, and more than one-quarter in Smolensk, Tula, 
Rybinsk, Voronezh, Astrakhan, Krasnodar, Izhevsk, Chita, and 
Kaliningrad. For the same reason more than half of all 
streetcars were idle in Cherepovets and Astrakhan; more than 40 
percent--in Pyatigorsk, Vladikavkaz, Nizhniy Tagil, and 
Kaliningrad; and 25-35 percent--in Ivanovo, Moscow, Smolensk, 
Yaroslavl, Volgograd, Samara, Zlatoust, and Magnitogorsk, 
Barnaul, Kemerovo, Novokuznetsk, Novosibirsk, Ulan-Ude, 
Krasnoyarsk. 
  Over the year, there were 104,100 incidents of trolley buses 
and 166,500 incidents of streetcars returning from their route 
ahead of schedule due to technical malfunction. 
  The unsatisfactory technical condition of the rolling stock 
results in the cancellation of scheduled runs and schedules not 
being followed. In 1993, 3.4 million (5.6 percent) of scheduled 
trolley bus and 2.5 million (9.4 percent) streetcars runs were 
not accomplished. 
  In a number of cities the frequency of runs of ground 
passenger electric transport was reduced considerably. The 
number of completed trolley bus runs in Barnaul dropped by 36 
percent as compared to 1992; in Sterlitamak--by 31 percent; in 
Leninsk-Kuznetsk and Novokuznetsk--by 21 percent and 23 percent, 
respectively; in Makhachkala--by 19 percent; in Shakhty--by 14 
percent; and in Moscow, Cherkessk, Novorossiysk, and 
Stavropol--by 8-10 percent; of streetcar runs--in Ust-Ilimsk--by 
43 percent, Shakhty--by 40 percent, Tver, Karpinsk, Biysk, 
Novokuznetsk--by 22-30 percent, Astrakhan--by 15 percent, 
Ufa--by 11 percent, and Tomsk--by 10 percent. 
  Despite considerable rate increases for urban electric 
transport fares (in December 1993 as compared to December 1992 
the cost of fares on streetcars and trolley buses increased by a 
factor of almost 15), passenger transportation by ground 
electric transport remains a money-loser. In 1993 in Russia as a 
whole operating expenses with respect to trolley buses exceeded 
revenue by R56.5 billion (1.7-fold), and streetcars--by R67.7 
billion (1.9-fold). 
  In most cities less than 10 percent of expenditures for 
maintenance and operation of streetcar and trolley bus transport 
is covered by sales of fare passes. 
  As a whole in all subways of the Russian Federation in 1993 
revenues from transporting paying passengers covered only 29 
percent of expenses; in Yekaterinburg this share amounted to 3 
percent, Samara--5 percent, Nizhniy Novgorod--14 percent, 
Moscow--28 percent, St. Petersburg--34 percent, and 
Novosibirsk--59 percent. 
  Oil and Gas Industry Operations in Tyumen Oblast. 
In 1993 Tyumen Oblast accounted for 67 percent of all Russian 
oil production, including gas condensate, and for 91 percent of 
natural gas. 
  The decline of oil production in the oblast continued in 
1993, and for the first time since production of gas began at 
Tyumen deposits, production of gas decreased as compared to the 
preceding year. The main indicators characterizing the work of 
Tyumen Oblast oil and gas industry are shown in the following 
table:

  In 1993 enterprises of the Russian Ministry of Fuel and 
Energy system in Tyumen Oblast produced 227 million tonnes of 
oil, including gas condensate, or 14 percent less than in 1992, 
and 562 billion cubic meters of gas (3 percent less). Oil 
production by joint and small enterprises amounted to 7.5 
million tonnes, which is 1.7 times more than in 1992, and by 
Russian Committee for Mineral Resources enterprises--1.5 million 
tonnes (a 2.1-fold increase). 
  Oil production through application of modern methods of 
increasing the output of oil beds increased by 14 percent, and 
its share in the total volume of oil production--from 9 percent 
in 1992 to 12 percent in 1993. 
  The trend toward an increase in the nonoperating stock of 
oil 
wells has been halted. While as of 1 January 1992 it accounted 
for 15.8 percent of all operating well stock, and on 1 January 
1993--24.1 percent; as of January 1994, 22 percent of wells were 
not operational. At the same time, this figure is considerably 
higher than the all-Russia average (15 percent). In 1993, 7,600 
previously idle oil wells were restored to operation, including 
436 wells with the participation of foreign companies on a 
contract basis, which is 1.7 times and 2.2 times more, 
respectively, than in 1992. 
  The decline in production of fuel in the oblast as a whole 
is 
the result of depletion of major deposits and the lack of money 
to invest in the development of the fuel industry. 
  As compared to 1990, the average daily production rate of 
oil 
wells declined by one-third. The rate of water encroachment of 
the pool increased from 75 percent to 80 percent. As a result, 
the energy-intensiveness of oil production in the oblast almost 
doubled. 
  A similar situation is beginning to develop in the gas 
industry, where the average daily production rate of wells over 
the indicated period declined by 14 percent. 
  The situation with respect to utilization of associated 
petroleum gas in not improving. In 1993, 23 percent of gas 
produced at oil fields was burned in flares (21 percent in 1990). 
  The volume of capital investment in the oblast's fuel 
industry from all sources of financing is continuously 
declining; in 1993 alone in the oil industry it dropped as 
compared to the preceding year by 46 percent, and in the gas 
industry--by 29 percent. 
  Lack of money for investment is to a considerable extent a 
result of consumer insolvency. As of 1 February 1994, Tyumen 
Oblast oil industry enterprises were owed R4.3 trillion, and gas 
industry enterprises--R0.5 trillion. 
  In 1993 Tyumen Oblast industrial enterprises earned $2.8 
billion--mainly from exports, which equals 22 percent of all 
Russian industry's foreign currency earnings. Over the year $1.2 
billion was used for imports. Among products imported were 
83,000 tonnes of steel pipe, 88,300 tonnes of liquid-carrying 
pipe, 3,000 vacuum and air pumps, and other equipment. The 
amount of money remaining in enterprises' foreign currency 
accounts amounted as of 1 January 1994 to $1.5 billion. 
  In January-February of this year, oil production, including 
gas condensate, amounted to 33.9 million tonnes, or 13 percent 
less than over the corresponding period of last year; and 
natural gas--99.5 billion cubic meters, which corresponds to the 
level of January-February of 1993. 
  Foreign Investment. According the Russian 
Goskomstat data, foreign investment in the economy of the 
Russian Federation in 1993 amounted to $2.9 billion. Of that, 
$2.6 billion (89.7 percent of all investment) was direct 
investment (which gives the investor the right to participate in 
managing the enterprise). 
  The most significant investment was in the following 
economic 
sectors:

<F P=106> [Article by A. Kirpichnikov, under the rubric "Budget": </F>
"Draft Budget: Not Bad, but No Good: Government Not Insisting on 
Duma Approval"] 
  [Text] Yesterday's hearings in the State Duma on mutual 
relations between the federal budget and the budgets of 
federation subjects were representative: participating were 
Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Aleksashenko, Deputy Economics 
Minister Andrey Shapovalyants, and Central Bank Deputy Chairman 
Tamara Paramonova, as well as the leaders of the "economic" 
committees of the lower chamber. 
  The representatives of executive power emphasized that for 
the first time a real, as opposed to declaratory, system for a 
trilevel budget had been proposed--federal, territorial 
(federation subjects), and local. The draft budget for 1994 has 
three basic divisions: income, expenditures, and transfers--from 
the federative into local budgets. Already a large part of taxes 
accrued is being sent to the locales: 37 percent of the 
value-added tax (VAT), 63 percent of the profit tax, 100 percent 
of the income tax, and so on. There is nothing fundamentally new 
about the expenditures division: federal spending for defense, 
debt support, and the implementation of Russia-wide programs 
eats up about 75 percent of the federal budget, leaving 
practically nothing to share with the territories. 
  The greatest number of innovations is in the transfers 
division. The creation of a financial support fund for the 
territories has been proposed in the amount of 22 percent of 
what comes in from the VAT. Three categories of territories are 
distinguished: those in need of help from the center, those in 
special need, and those not in need. Upon classifying the 
territories in a transfer class, the population's income and 
expense structure will be taken into account. Investments are 
planned only for unfinished sites of unusual economic or social 
importance. Assistance will be given to regions that have 
suffered from radiation, as well as areas of the North and the 
Kuriles, on principle. 
  The optimistic speeches of the three deputy ministers, 
however, met with approval from the deputy body and guests at 
the hearings only in the sense that finally at least some steps 
were being taken to meet the regions halfway. Critics were 
incomparably more numerous. It was pointed out that the Duma had 
not been presented with a consolidated budget broken down by 
regions, and therefore to talk about real changes in budgetary 
policy and their specific consequences was impossible. It was 
pointed out that a financial support fund of 22 percent is 
relatively less than the 35 percent from the federal budget 
allocated for the same purpose in 1993. Attention was drawn to 
the fact that the division of regions into three classes had not 
been fully thought out, that it insults the raw-materials 
territories that provide the country with its main hard currency 
income, and that it could give rise to interregional conflicts. 
  Numerous speakers from the floor emphasized the 
poverty-stricken situation with their budgets, differing in 
their definitions of how the necessary financial assistance 
should be applied, but agreeing that the draft budget as a 
document is incomplete and that it contradicts the Constitution. 
Representatives of the unions of cities complained that the role 
of the budgets of these points of settlement had been 
underassessed and insisted on the need to protect them from 
attempted incursions by oblast or kray authorities. Villagers 
expressed themselves likewise. Finally, the issue was touched on 
of the obligatory cancellation at the government level of the 
promises of indexation, loans, and other preferential outlays 
that the government and president had promised in resolutions 
and edicts but had not provided the money for, addressing those 
desiring local budgets. Tax rates, state guarantees, and much 
else was debated. 
  In the end, the hearings showed that, in its current form, 
the draft budget for 1994 is not going to win Duma approval. 
Hearing organizers consoled deputies with the fact that the 
government itself does not seem likely to insist on the 
document's passage, being aware of its incompleteness. It all 
came down to the fact that there is no point in simply returning 
the draft to the Council of Ministers; it is essential, however, 
to form with government representatives a joint group to 
complete work on it.

<F P=106> [Article by Leonid Sharov: "They Are Threatening, But We Are </F>
Not Afraid," preceded by a "warning" from the Committee on the 
Press and followed by remarks from a legal expert] 
  [Text] Warning 
  OBSHCHAYA GAZETA No. 11 of March 1994 published 
material entitled "Kidneys Are Swelling. Is a Putsch Coming? 
Version No. 1," which contains information on a coup d'etat, 
aimed at discrediting leaders of the Federal Duma and the 
Russian Federation Government, which is allegedly being 
prepared. 
  The Russian Federation Committee on the Press believes 
that by disseminating deliberately false and slanderous 
fabrications by an anonymous author aimed at undermining the 
constitutional order and destabilizing the situation in the 
society, the editorial staff of OBSHCHAYA GAZETA has violated 
Articles 4 and 51 of the Russian Federation Law "On the Mass 
Media." 
  In accordance with its powers, the Russian Fedration 
Committee on the Press issues an official warning to the 
OBSHCHAYA GAZETA editorial staff. 
  [Signed] First Deputy Chairman of the Committee on the Press 
V.V. VOLODIN 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  So OBSHCHAYA GAZETA has gotten its deserts. Next came a 
statement by the Russian Federation Committee on the Press 
devoted to glasnost. The questions asked in it were no laughing 
matter: 
  --Who wants to turn the peoples of Russia into a biomass 
without a tongue? 
  --In whose interest is it to sow the poisonous seed of 
hostility between the branches of government? 
  --In whose interest is it to sow the same seed between the 
leadership and society? 
  --Who is eager to undermine the constitutional order? 
  --To whose advantage is it to keep Russia in an atmosphere 
of 
rumors, gossip, and slander--ultimately fear? 
  And there is an answer. On the eve of "Laughter Day" (or as 
they still call it, "Fools' Day"), the deliberate criminal has 
been identified at last. It is OBSHCHAYA GAZETA! And something 
is not very laughable, even on 1 April. Although it is not very 
frightening, either. Rather, it is a little nasty. For example, 
what is the value of the first paragraph in the committee's 
statement to watch over the democratic achievements of our mass 
media: "Only unprincipled politicians who put their own 
ambitions above the fundamental interests of the state, the 
society, and the nation, can..." Such deep drilling should be 
envied by Iosif Stalin, Andrey Zhdanov, and Mikhail Suslov. 
  Let us explain for those who have not been readers. A spark 
was lit because in two preceding issues, the editorial staff had 
published the so-called "Version No. 1," explaining in a 
commentary here that this was obviously a hoax aimed at 
discrediting a number of major political figures. Why is the 
newspaper publishing a document which it states itself is from a 
questionable source? Because the provocative writing, regardless 
of the view of any newspaper, is being disseminated and 
unfortunately has become a fact of sociopolitical life. 
Following our publication, numerous commentaries demonstrated 
once again how many had "Version No. 1" in hand, were reading 
it, and were pondering what would actually take place. 
  Both before and after the warning, the editorial staff 
continues to be confident that an informed public is within its 
direct responsibility. Moreover, this is precisely the reason it 
exists. 
  But the anger which has been directed at us is like an echo 
of those distant times when the first one to bring bad news had 
his head chopped off. Three weeks have passed since our 
publication. Neither the public prosecutor's office nor 
counterintelligence has been able to answer: who has been so 
assiduously disseminating slander on a coup, who has been 
circulating it, and who has been passing the anonymous document 
from hand to hand? the head of the FSK [expansion not given] 
states that they have managed to find the authors of the 
document. Though special efforts were not required for this: the 
first one--Gleb Pavlovskiy, came to our editorial office himself 
and told us about work on the document. As far as those who were 
interested in disseminating the false document and spared 
neither time nor effort for this are concerned, nothing is known 
about them. It is not hard to assume that they will not want to 
reveal their names. The simplest thing is to accuse OBSHCHAYA 
GAZETA of all the sins. 
  Official reaction to the newspaper's statement is striking 
for its inadequacy. Every day in the newspapers and on 
television we read and see every possible kind of statement by 
all kinds of extremist political figures. All of them are simply 
taken into consideration, and it does not occur to anyone to 
make television or newspapers take responsibility for these 
statements: evceryone recognizes the right of the SMI [mass 
media] to reveal information. 
  So what aroused the guardians of public tranquillity in our 
case? Let us examine the details. If the committee decides to 
repudiate "Version No. 1" after OG [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA], why all 
the fuss? There are simply no reasons to be worried about public 
stability and the constitutional system. But if a state 
department believes there are reasons for this anyway, then it 
consequently assumes that "Version No. 1" is not all a pack of 
lies; in this case, reproaching the newspaper for spreading 
slanderous misinformation is even more unfair. This is like 
accusing the doctor who gives an inoculation against rabies of 
deliberately spreading infection. 
  What is the point of the warning given to us? This is what 
it 
is: "Next time do not take it into your head to inform the 
public about a provocation being prepared, but the main thing is 
not to interfere first and without permission--otherwise you 
will be burned for sure!" Alas, OBSHCHAYA GAZETA cannot accept 
these instructions for implementation. In the event that 
something like "Version No. 1" is undertaken, we will respond to 
it in accordance with our convictions and professional 
responsibility by warning the public (but not the bureaucracy) 
of impending dangers. Because only a putsch itself can confirm 
rumors about a putsch. This is enough, we have already "gone 
through it." In August 1991, three were buried by a million. In 
October 1993, at least 150 died... No one but the relatives 
knows where they are buried. The consequence has ended--forget 
it. 
  But why are there so many extreme epithets threatening coups 
and exclamation points in those documents which made their 
appearance in the Committee on the Press 10 days after our 
publication? Because nothing else is left for them. They have to 
threaten when there is no legal basis to deal with those who do 
not want to be near you. 
  You have been threatened badly, as I see. 
<H8>  The Scheme for Accusation: Falsity-Previous </H8>
Knowledge-Premeditation 
  The excitement at the General Prosecutor's Office about 
the slander gave rise to conflicting opinions among the public 
and in the press. 
  We asked Aleksandr Yakovlev, professor and doctor of 
juridical sciences, for a particularly professional assessment 
of the scheme, which is how this matter can be classified. 
  As soon as a criminal case has been raised, it certainly 
involves the application of Article 130 of the UK [Criminal 
Code], or more precisely, its third part, which defines the 
punishment for slander, combined with the charge of a state or 
other heinous crime. It has to be kept in mind that slander is 
the dissemination of DELIBERATELY false fabrications which 
defame another person. This wording must be "combined" with the 
principle of the presumption of innocence which applies in 
criminal law. This means that the burden of proof lies with the 
prosecuting side. Three things must be proved in a slander case: 
the falsity of the information disseminated; the fact that the 
falsity was known beforehand to the accused; and the fact that 
they acted with premeditation. This is the chain that appears: 
falsity-previous knowledge-premeditation. 
  But it also happens that a person who disseminates false, 
defamatory information has been honestly deluded. In this case, 
we can and should speak about libel, which is a subject for 
consideration in civil law. Here the burden of proof lies with 
the defendant. The defendant's intention has no significance. 
  Slander and libel lead to different legal consequences. 
Slander (Article 130 of the Criminal Code, Part 3) leads to 
imprisonment for a period of up to 5 years. Libel leads to 
refutation, and in a number of cases to compensation for 
material damages, if the court comes to the conclusion that this 
took place. 
  Most cases of slander and libel are linked with publication 
in the press. It is very difficlt to assess the role of the mass 
media in disseminating information that is incorrect. On one 
hand, real protection must be given to a citizen's honor and 
dignity. On the other hand, to encroach upon the prerogative of 
the press, which ensures the right of that same citizen to 
information--that is not to silence the newspapers and other 
mass media.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Petrovskaya: "How Do We Measure </F>
Emptiness?"] 
  [Text] There are broadcasts which have no viewers or 
practically no viewers. On various channels. For various 
reasons. Sometimes the viewers are at fault--those who have a 
duty to work but want to escape from it, those who prefer the 
easier mass culture to what is serious. Sometimes the television 
companies themselves are at fault because they are unable to 
find programs which deserve the viewers' attention and are 
worthy of air time. In a word, all the unlucky broadcasts are 
unlucky in their own way. But for an entire channel to manage 
without viewers for its entire existence! This is impossible, 
you will say. There is such a channel, I respond. It is called 
"Severnaya Korona," and it is on Sagalayev's Channel 6. 
  Strictly speaking, "Sagalayev's Channel 6" is an 
exaggeration. There is a "TV-6 Moscow" company whose president 
is Eduard Sagalayev. And there is the "Severnaya Korona" 
Company, which broadcasts on the same frequency as Sagalayev. 
There are two major differences, as they say in Odessa. 
  The cohabitation of two different broadcasters in the same 
broadcasting space, from the standpoint of common sense, began a 
year and a half ago as the result of the competition for the 
last free channel in the meter waveband. The heated struggle was 
no laughing matter at that time, and there were many contenders. 
The licensing commission decided on a compromise and issued two 
licenses right away: to the Moscow Independent Broadcasting 
Corporation headed by E. Sagalayev and the International 
Television Business University headed by V. Novikov (who is also 
a director of the Board of Interregional Programs of Russian TV). 
  The palliative decision of the licensing commission led to 
perplexity among the specialists familiar with broadcasting 
concepts such as programming policy and channel integrity. 
However, the eternal Russian desire to give earrings to all 
the sisters won out. 
  The "sisters" began broadcasting on 1 January 1993. 
"Severnaya Korona," unlike "Moscow TV-6," was maintained 
modestly, advance payments and promises were not dispensed, and 
it did not organize a wide-scale advertising campaign in the 
newspapers--let us set up the business, they said, equip it 
properly, and then we will relax. From remarks appearing in the 
press every now and then, however, it was learned that 
"Severnaya Korona" had been planned as an educational channel to 
provide regular television instruction in various disciplines, 
including business, management, and marketing. 
  For the sake of fairness, it should be pointed out that 
"Severnaya Korona" was put under difficult circumstances from 
the very start, for it received broadcasting time from 1500 to 
1900 hours daily. This time (especially from 1500 to 1700) is 
not considered the most "watchable" on the other, popular 
channels. A song of admiration could have been sung for "the 
foolhardiness of the brave," if not for the quality of the 
programs presented for the verdict of viewers. These 
kinds of programs do not attract viewers, but turn them 
away. While the primitive level of most "Severnaya Korona" 
broadcasts could have been explained in the beginning by its 
poverty and lack of experience, now, after a year has passed, 
this is impossible to explain by anything but the lack of 
professionalism of its founders. 
  The main content of the channel (except for occasional 
foreign documentary films) consists of endless direct contact 
with various "talking heads." You will recognize "Severnaya 
Korona" easily by its "picture"--dull, expressionless, with poor 
lighting and a fixed camera. Even on days off, when it would 
seem that the time that is disadvantageous on other days can and 
should be used to its maximum effect, one such broadcast is 
replaced by another--without inventivenes, imagination, or any 
kind of intervention by a director. 
  At the same time, despite the fact that there are few 
obvious 
advertisements on the channel (what kind of advertiser would 
place advertising in a void?), most of the discussions in the 
studio are poorly concealed advertisements. It is obvious that 
these are so-called paid materials: a guest or guests pay for 
their statements on the air themselves. 
  For example, here is an unconvincing discussion with the 
stage singer "Nika" and her producer. And the telephone of 
"Nika's" studio is given in a subtitled still shot for the 
entire 10 minutes of the discussion. After "Nika" there is a 
group of identical faceless men representing some firm. A 
discussion about the transformers produced by the firm is 
accompanied by subtitles: "Delivery of oil-immersed power 
transformers... Telephones such and such." Even a viewer 
inexperienced in the subtleties of television production will 
easily see through the commercial format of the studio 
discussion--despite the impertinent statement by the announcer: 
"I think most viewers are interested in conctacts with your 
firm." 
  Everything else has the same relationship to the education 
declared by the channel as the oil-immersed transformer has to 
the interests of most viewers. We can confidently acknowledge 
only one achievement by "Severnaya Korona"--it is the first and 
only really independent channel. It truly does not depend on 
viewers at all. According to the Sociological Service of V. 
Vilchek, the rating of "Severnaya Korona" has not once climbed 
higher than 2 percent during its year of existence; this 
actually means zero, nothing. "Severnaya Korona" has 
never been mentioned in any of the regularly 
conducted surveys of viewer preferences! This is the kind of 
broadcast misunderstanding there is in Russia's capital. 
  I do not know who is financing all this, but since the 
channel exists, it means that there are reckless persons who are 
paying for emptiness. Amazingly, "Severnaya Korona" has 
accumulated everything in its small broadcasting space that is 
bad about TV in general--banality of musical broadcasts, boring 
econoimic broadcasts, tedious political broadcasts, and 
shameless advertising broadcasts. In concentrated form, this 
"compote" is definitely not edible, and the viewer turns up his 
nose. And correctly so. There is more appetizing food on the 
daily TV menu. 
  Well, there is one more lesson: it turns out that 
independence from the state in itself is no panacea for the lack 
of talent and professionalism.

Vishnevskaya; place and date not given: "Not To Break Under the 
Burden of Debt"] 
  [Text] What is happening to the economy? Why is the 
crisis worsening? The questions that many reputable economists 
attempt to answer most often draw quite fuzzy answers. The 
"Gaydar team" appears to have done everything properly at the 
outset: It liberated the economy from the Gosplan [State 
Planning Committee] and the Gossnab [State Committee for 
Material and Technical Supply] and other legacies of the old 
system, decontrolled prices, and put production under the power 
of the "invisible hand" of the market. However, we have somehow 
gotten stuck at the accomplishments of summer 1992.... This is 
fraught with consequences! As is known, Grigoriy Yavlinskiy has 
his own view of what is happening, his own predictions for the 
future, and also his own program for overcoming the crisis. 
Grigoriy Alekseyevich believes that the main point is for us not 
to break under the burden of debt. 
  [Yavlinskiy] At present, the economy of the country is under 
pressure from a powerful spring of inflation which was 
compressed precisely by the Gaydar government. Total debts for 
last year by virtue of state procurement and settlements with 
sectors receiving money from the budget now comes to about 5 
percent of the gross national product. In the fourth quarter 
alone, the growth of credit outlays came to 75 percent of growth 
during all of 1993. It comes to approximately 15 trillion rubles 
[R]. All this is a consequence of decisions made previously. 
  [Vishnevskaya] However, public opinion is that the "fathers 
of reform" have left the government, and the latter is now 
rolling back slowly but surely. Preferences for the 
military-industrial complex and subsidies for agriculture have 
already been promised.... Could it be that the past two years 
have been in vain? 
  [Yavlinskiy] That the new government could lead Russia back 
is not the trouble. There is no way back anymore. However, not 
only does the new government lack a program, it also hardly has 
any idea of the situation that is beginning to emerge this year. 
It is this situation that conceals the danger! The danger is 
that, with its vision of reforms, the new government may embark 
on a path of extensively handing out easy credit and subsidies 
from the budget. Trillions of rubles have already been promised 
to various sectors. To be sure, it has not yet come to making 
payments; they are talking about stage-by-stage payment of the 
debt. However, how long will the government be able to resist 
powerful pressure from sectoral lobbyists and evade meeting its 
own obligations? The temptation to become a kind and good 
government is great; besides, sectoral lobbies are very strong 
in the government. 
  To be sure, the latest events indicate that the government 
expects to stay the old course for a while longer. Under such 
circumstances, our analysis outlined above may end up shifted in 
time somewhat in the direction of delay; on the other hand, the 
projected crisis may turn out to be deeper.... 
  [Vishnevskaya] So, what may lie ahead for us? Under the 
circumstances, what scenario for the development of events do 
you see for the coming year, especially because the first 
quarter is already coming to the end, and its preliminary 
results can be assessed? 
  [Yavlinskiy] The first quarter took pressure from the credit 
outlays of last year and the need to pay back the debts of the 
budget which, in turn, were induced by a chain of nonpayments 
throughout the economy. This is why the spring will apparently 
become the first critical mark this year. A quite sharp upsurge 
in inflation is possible in the spring in conjunction with the 
infusion of money in the first quarter. The budget deficit will 
grow considerably. Spring will be difficult and this will, of 
course, provide the background for changes in the political 
sphere. Summer could be relatively stable, but then at a new 
level of the critical phenomena which I discussed. The fall, the 
second critical mark, gives rise to the greatest concern. At 
this point the risk of losing control over inflation and a slump 
in production is high. In the fall, inflation may exceed the 50 
percent level, and it will be very hard, if not impossible, to 
manage. 
  [Vishnevskaya] Why should this definitely happen in the 
fall? 
The government intends to pay the debts back to rural residents 
virtually right away. Besides, procurement of agricultural 
products by the state is far less now.... 
  [Yavlinskiy] The volume of state procurement is large enough 
to cause both an aggravation of the budget deficit and an 
increase in effective demand. However, this is only the first 
alarming factor of the coming summer. An increase in energy 
resource prices is the second. The pressure of cost-push 
inflation through energy resources will be extremely serious and 
very extensive by this fall. 
  [Vishnevskaya] What awaits us by the end of the year in your 
scenario? 
  [Yavlinskiy] The slump in production may exceed 52 percent 
of 
the 1989 level--the last year of growth. The absence of 
investment will become the fundamental, root cause of the slump. 
  [Vishnevskaya] This cause has been affecting the status of 
production for a long time.... 
  [Yavlinskiy] Its effect is exacerbated by another cause, 
which does not appear to be new. It is the loss of markets for 
sales. We have lost not just Western markets. Markets in the CIS 
have been lost in conjunction with the cancellation of an 
economic treaty with the republics of the former USSR and an 
unwise attitude toward economic integration with them. Beginning 
15 June of last year we managed to lose at an accelerated rate 
our own, Russian market for our industry because of the 
situation with the exchange rate of the dollar. As the sharp 
growth of prices continued, the Central Bank maintained the 
artificial exchange rate of the ruble against the dollar for so 
long that it became more advantageous to import goods rather 
than have them produced by domestic industry. The loss of 
domestic markets by the latter has virtually become an 
accomplished fact. Of course, we can recover these markets. 
However, it is now going to cost us in the form of a sharp 
decline in the exchange rate over a quite lengthy period of time. 
  [Vishnevskaya] However, yet another weighty factor which 
induces a drop in production has appeared or rather become 
sharply more pronounced: Labor collectives are increasingly 
striving to use available funds for consumption rather than 
investing them in the development of production. 
  [Yavlinskiy] This is a new problem generated as a result of 
the kind of privatization of large enterprises the Gaydar 
government accepted and conducted, and which the Chernomyrdin 
government is continuing. Therefore, rather than referring to a 
structural fall which is generally necessary, we are compelled 
to refer to a general slump which has advanced to such a stage 
that it has now become a factor in the accident rate, various 
production stoppages for technical reasons, and other major 
troubles which call for 10-fold expenditures from the budget. 
  [Vishnevskaya] To your mind, what can be done to prevent, 
after all, the development of events in keeping with the quite 
gloomy scenario outlined here? 
  [Yavlinskiy] Trying to keep inflation to a rate of 20 
percent 
a month in 1994 is the foremost among many urgent tasks. To this 
end it is necessary, first, to bring the exchange rate of the 
dollar into line with the dynamics of inflation. If the dynamics 
of the market rate do not correspond to that projected, the 
government should compensate for the difference those with whom 
it has concluded futures transactions. Second, by no means and 
under no circumstances may there be a transition to a policy of 
easy credit and direct subsidies. Instead, I am proposing a 
painful measure, but the only correct one under such conditions: 
a reduction in the interest rate, with the volume of credit 
being administratively regulated. Enterprises are simply not in 
a position to take out loans given the current interest rate! 
This would be a temporary measure because in principle it is 
necessary to strive for an interest rate that exceeds the rate 
of inflation in the country. 
  Third, the policy of preferences for exporters should be 
revised sharply in order to prevent the outflow of foreign 
exchange from the country. Of course, the tax on the difference 
in exchange rates, the most powerful incentive for the 
exportation of funds, should be canceled immediately. 
  [Vishnevskaya] However, whether we like it or not, the 
problem of debt due to state procurement remains. Will this 
inflationary mine be rendered less dangerous if the measures you 
are proposing are implemented? 
  [Yavlinskiy] The signing of contracts for the delivery of 
foodstuffs to the state stocks in the fall should begin right 
now! This would make it possible to spread all transactions and 
expenditures throughout the year and not accumulate the entire 
backlog of debt in the fall. Reductions in the volume of state 
procurement for current consumption should also begin without 
delay. It is necessary to privatize the entire procurement 
infrastructure, primarily the elevators, right now. These are 
absolutely urgent measures which would make it possible to bring 
inflation under control within a year if they were taken 
immediately. 
  [Vishnevskaya] And if they were not? 
  [Yavlinskiy] Then we will mark time again and endlessly 
complain about "the forces hindering reforms...."

<F P=106> [Article by Bronislav Lisin, professor and board chairman of </F>
the New East Society for Supporting Economic Cooperation, 
Munich: "Social Portrait of Russian Entrepreneurship"] 
  [Text] It was only a few years ago that a layer of 
entrepreneurs began to be reborn in Russia -- first, through 
cooperatives; later, the road was opened to partnerships with 
limited responsibilities, joint-stock companies and, finally, 
private enterprises. Many political forces link their plans for 
economic and political reforms in Russia with these people. 
During the recently held elections, there were no voting blocks 
which did not declare their support for entrepreneurship. An 
even larger number of parties, associations, funds, etc., 
claimed that they, and only they, have the right to speak in the 
name of the entrepreneurs and to represent their interests. Who 
is he, the Russian entrepreneur? 
  Primarily, it is not the political sympathies of the 
entrepreneurs but their parameters as business partners that 
interest us. 
  Let us avail ourselves of the materials from a survey of 
participants in the Second International Congress of Small and 
Average Entrepreneurship in Russia, which was held in Moscow 
during the summer of 1993. A total of 1,300 entrepreneurs from 
all regions of Russia participated in its work at the time. 
One-tenth responded to the questionnaire of the New East 
Society, which conducted this survey jointly with the Russian 
Management Personnel Consulting and Research Center. 
  There were no big businessmen at the congress. Those, who 
had 
practically not yet begun active entrepreneurial activity but 
who were just taking the first steps in it, were also not 
present. In a word, we will talk about the normal Russian 
entrepreneurs. 
  Where did they come from? The opinion is prevalent that 
former CPSU workers and criminal elements basically became 
entrepreneurs. Possibly, such exist. However, our information 
says that 46.6 percent of the entrepreneurs came from 
production, 18.8 percent worked in VUZ [higher educational 
institutions] and scientific establishments, another 6.75 
percent were students, and 3 percent were servicemen. Only 13.5 
percent came from the state apparatus and less than 3.3 percent 
from the party and Komsomol. With all the shake-ups that have 
occurred in the management staff during recent years, one should 
only welcome the fact that a part of the bureaucrats decided to 
earn money on their own and not settle into the next "office." 
  The opinion that, except for cunning and cleverness, an 
entrepreneur does not need either special brains or education, 
was also not confirmed. It is difficult to talk about intellect; 
we did not conduct an intellectual testing. There is total order 
with respect to the entrepreneurs' education. A total of 90 
percent have a higher education and 13.5 percent an academic 
degree besides. The majority (63.9 percent) are engineers; 30.8 
percent -- economists; 12 percent -- humanities graduates; 3.75 
percent -- jurists, etc. Several have two and even three higher 
educational diplomas. Almost half have a good command of the 
English language; 18.8 percent -- the German; substantially 
fewer know other languages. 
  There were not so few women among the respondents -- 20.3 
percent. A total of 83.5 percent were married. Despite the 
widespread opinion that entrepreneurial activity has a bad 
influence on family life, there were not many among those 
surveyed who were divorced -- 6 percent. 
  Here is the composition of the surveyed entrepreneurs by age 
(see Table No 1). 


Table 1 

Age         Up to   26-30     31-35     36-40     41-50     51-60     Older 
            25                                                        than 60 


Percent     1.5     9.0       12.8      19.5      37.6      13.5      1.5 


  Thus, it is basically people, who are already mature and who 
have a good life experience, that engage in entrepreneurship. 
The motivation for their activity also confirms this. 
  To the question: "What motivates you to engage in 
entrepreneurial activity?" the following answers were received: 
  - the desire for independence and self-realization -- 52.0 
percent. 
  - the desire to provide material independence for myself -- 
45.1 percent. 
  - the wish to carry out my own plans and to incorporate my 
own ideas and works -- 45.1 percent. 
  - the wish to make my own contribution to the forming of a 
market economy --32.3 percent. 
  - the absence of other types of activity -- 0.75 percent. 
  It is quite clear that not hopelessness but a completely 
deliberate choice led the respondents to entrepreneurship. When 
answering another question about whether they would again make 
this selection now, 91 percent confidently said: "Yes" and only 
0.75 percent said: "No." 
  This is particularly important because 57.2 percent of the 
surveyed entrepreneurs can be called veterans. They began to 
engage in this activity during the period from 1985 to 1990, 
inclusive. A total of 32.3 percent became entrepreneurs during 
1991-1992 and only 2.25 percent can be called beginners. (In a 
number of cases, the total is somewhat less than 100 percent 
because some did not answer this question; in other cases, it is 
more than 100 percent because a respondent could mark several 
versions of answers). 
  The information about the type of the activity and the 
nature 
of the enterprises is of undoubted interest. Based on form of 
ownership, 50.4 percent are joint-stock companies: 33 percent -- 
private individual ones; and 6.0 percent -- cooperatives. A 
total of 5.3 percent have foreign capital. Among the surveyed 
entrepreneurs, 42.1 percent are joint owners of their 
enterprises, 30.0 percent are stockholders, 20.3 percent work on 
contract, and 9.0 percent are individual owners. 
  Based on number of workers, the enterprises are distributed 
in the following manner (see Table No 2). 


Table 2 

Number     6-10    11-20    21-50    51-100    101-250    251-500    More 
                                                                     than 
                                                                     500 

Percent    8.3     14.3     15.8     16.5      20.3       5.3        4.5 


  From the cited table, it is clearly seen that we are dealing 
in a very strict sense with small and average entrepreneurs. 
  Almost half of these enterprises are located in oblast and 
kray centers and other large cities; 30.0 percent are in small 
cities. A total of 22.5 percent of the respondents were from 
Moscow or Saint Petersburg. As was already mentioned above, 
practically all regions of Russia were represented in the 
sampling. 
  Before describing the type of activity, one should point out 
that the majority of firms in Russia have been forced to engage 
in different types of work. Under conditions where a market is 
only being formed and where the norms regulating the activity of 
entrepreneurs frequently change, it is impossible, as they say, 
to put all your eggs in one basket. In addition, assets have a 
very rapid turnover in trade. Nevertheless, the strategic trend 
in the development of Russian entrepreneurship -- the production 
of goods and services -- is being clearly tracked; this is 
evident from the table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Among the most important factors having a positive or 
negative impact on the activity of small and average 
enterprises, almost three-quarters of the surveyed entrepreneurs 
mentioned state laws; half -- relations with banks; 30.8 percent 
each -- monetary assets and the qualifications of personnel; and 
26.3 percent -- relations with local authorities. Other factors 
disturb them considerably less, for example, production 
practices -- 7.5 percent; and production costs -- 6.3 percent. 
Only 6.7 percent of the respondents mentioned the racket, about 
which so much is said and written. 
  However, even the mentioned problems do not reduce the level 
of optimism in our respondents. To the directly posed question 
about the degree of their confidence in the success of their 
business, they answered: Have complete confidence -- 37.6 
percent; basically convinced -- 44.4 percent. Only 0.75 percent 
have a complete lack of confidence. 
  The block of questions concerning the foreign economic 
activity of the entrepreneurs was extremely full. A total of 
62.3 percent of them have foreign partners. However, only about 
half have specific projects with them. Just as many respondents 
regularly go abroad. A total of 23.3 percent of those surveyed 
have never traveled abroad. 
  An absolute majority of the entrepreneurs (87.2 percent) 
emphasized that they need the assistance of consulting firms to 
establish contacts with the necessary organizations and 
businessmen abroad and an organizational accompaniment for 
implementing agreements and contracts. 
  A total of 38.3 percent of the entrepreneurs indicated their 
lack of sufficient information about the interests of foreign 
partners and conditions for activity abroad as the main 
difficulty in their foreign economic activity. 
  In the opinion of the entrepreneurs, the most preferred 
types 
of cooperation are:

  The proposal about possible investments from Russia occupies 
the last line. Meanwhile, this is a completely realistic 
possibility. Actually, free capacities frequently exist in 
Western countries for producing a number of the products 
required by Russia. The problem is not a simple one; however, it 
deserves very careful study. 
  The problem of Western investments in the Russian economy 
still has great urgency. We are talking about private 
investments. The following conditions are required for this: 
  1) The possibility to select an investment project from 
correctly formulated proposals of equal value; 
  2) Support and written guarantees from regional (oblast, 
kray, republic) management bodies; 
  3) Professional consulting accompaniment for organizational, 
legal and all other types of questions on the part of a Russian 
or Russian-German firm. 
  If one is talking about the projects of small and average 
business, this is quite sufficient to begin work. The political 
risk has practically no serious relationship to this subject. 
  The political line of entrepreneurship itself is the policy 
of concrete affairs in the area of a market economy. It is no 
accident that 70.7 percent of those surveyed did not participate 
in the activity of parties and social movements. They are 
engaged in business and building the foundation of a new economy. 
  Of course, we are not pioneers in the area of a market 
economy; many countries have achieved great success on this 
path. In the opinion of the Russian entrepreneurs, which one is 
of most interest to us? 
  Germany -- 39.1 percent, USA -- 28.6 percent, South Korea -- 
21.0 percent, China -- 17.3 percent, Japan -- 15.8 percent, 
Sweden -- 13.5 percent 
  A considerably smaller number of respondents indicated the 
experience of other countries. 
  This information makes one wonder. Look at the bookshelves 
of 
Russian stores. Are there many books on the experience of the 
FRG? At a minimum, nine out of ten books are devoted to the 
experience of the United States or other English-speaking 
countries. The lack of the required amount of necessary 
knowledge and experience transfers is becoming a serious problem 
that must be solved by joint efforts.

Learned How To Spend, We Will Learn How To Earn: Notes from the 
Fifth Assembly of Railroad Chiefs"] 
  [Text] The results of 1993 and the results of the 
first two months of this year upset all the calculations: 
instead of the predicted drop in the transport volume, in the 
range of 4 percent, by last December the reduction had reached 
20 percent and more. This recession continued in March. Despite 
the rigid stand of a number of railroads, they did not succeed 
in achieving any sudden change in remuneration for transport. As 
before, the mining, oil- and gas-extracting sectors, as well as 
enterprises of the chemical and timber complex, were insolvent. 
A number of major Russian enterprises periodically shut down and 
stopped shipping goods. 
  The situation was similar on virtually every railroad. 
The problems of advance financing were exacerbated, both with 
respect to transfer of funds by the MPS [Ministry of Railways] 
and settlement of accounts with other railroads and 
enterprises. 
  That is why the sector's "brain center" assembled in 
Yekaterinburg. The assembly constituted not only a unique 
training aid and exchange of opinions of the road directors, but 
also a means of working out future strategy and tactics. The 
measures outlined were obviously inadequate. The joint efforts 
of the roads to seek levers of influence on the deepest strata 
of the railroad economy had to be coordinated. As O. Sharadze, 
chief of the Gorkiy Railroad, said, because of the changed 
conditions, structural changes were necessary as well. "Whereas 
before, they pressed transportation on us and we had to decide 
how we were to convey things, now, in my opinion, the structures 
which are earning money have to be moved to the foreground. We 
all learned how to spend, but few learned how to earn. 
Therefore, I feel: we need to perform a structural 
reorganization so that the economy is in the foreground. This is 
the basis of all bases." 
  Three main blocks of questions were singled out at the 
assembly. These were the economic interaction of the roads with 
respect to carrying out the government decree "On the Position 
of the Russian Economy and Prospects for Its Development in 
1994" and the statutes passed by the MPS Collegium on 11 March 
1994; improving the transport process, or rather, reorganizing 
it, in conformity with the new conditions, and carrying out 
state programs for traffic safety. 
  I. Besedin, deputy minister, in speaking to the assembly 
participants, devoted his main attention to following a flexible 
tariff policy and granting broader rights in this respect to the 
railroad chiefs. As we know, a one-ruble rise in the tariff for 
transport will lead to a five-fold increase in prices on the 
commodity market. Meanwhile, along with insolvency, the increase 
in tariffs played a decisive role in the deterioration of the 
sector's economic situation. 
  While in 1991, the increase in tariffs had virtually no 
effect on transport volumes, and many things in the economy were 
still moving due to inertia, the first abrupt crisis arrived in 
May-June 1992, when tariffs all in all rose by a factor of 62 
compared with the 1989 price list. The situation then stabilized 
somewhat, but in November 1993, after the next rise in tariffs, 
by a factor of 1.5, a second crisis occurred: freight turnover 
dropped by practically 30 percent and more, and carriage charges 
began to be greatly in excess of the value of the goods 
transported. 
  Within the limits of a single mainline, following a flexible 
tariff policy -- whom and how much does it benefit -- is within 
the jurisdiction of the railroad chief. But what happens when 
freight travels over two to three roads or more? 
  The participants in the assembly suggested several 
perspectives on the solution to this problem. In the first 
place, granting rebates and concluding the appropriate contracts 
with the consignors of the dispatching road by telegraphed 
agreement with the road of destination. 
  In the second place, it was proposed that for an operative 
and qualified solution to the problems of regulating tariffs in 
through service and for market research, with the development of 
the appropriate recommendations on organizing transport and 
tariff policy, a network marketing center, so to speak, a tariff 
administration, be created at the MPS. 
  The next perspective had already been discussed at the MPS 
Collegium. The overall level of tariffs today is such that 
railroad workers have begun to lose out in the competition with 
motor vehicle transport, where the growth rates of the tariffs 
are lower -- not to mention small shipments and perishable 
freight, as well as reinforced concrete items and building 
materials, and moreover for long distances. The advantage in the 
tariffs stems from the fact that the production cost of motor 
vehicle transport does not include expenditures to maintain the 
highways. Meanwhile, the railroad workers, through tax on the 
railroad funds, by means of their own expenditures and 
accordingly, tariffs, even finance the motorists. 
  On granting broader rights to the road chiefs.... This is a 
two-edged weapon, a serious question. Why? The railroad workers 
are regarded as monopolists, hence it is natural that the 
anti-monopoly committee pays close attention to railroad 
directors. Some railroads have already had to pay millions in 
fines for this reason. Here we need the skilled work of 
specialists, lawyers and economists, careful, impeccable work on 
preparing contracts and fulfilling all the necessary 
requirements. The MPS drew up methodological instructions, which 
give recommendations, scientifically and with substantiation, on 
organizing transport and the tariff policy. 
  The assembly also paid great attention to problems of 
improving cost-accounting relations within the sector. The 
method of formulating and the level of accounting prices for the 
transport of freight and passengers in through service, along 
with the volumes of transport, prove to have a considerable 
effect on the financial results of the railroads. For most of 
them, the relative proportion of transport in through service 
and the revenues from it is overwhelming. 
  Many years of practical experience show that the existing 
system of accounting prices does not meet the requirements of an 
objective evaluation of the railroads' financial-economic 
activity. The roads are not interested in seeking and realizing 
reserves for the rise and fall of expenses. 
  For example, the Sverdlovsk Railroad had a 15-billion loss 
from transport in January, while the Baykal-Amur had a 
15-billion profit. If one considers that the transport volumes 
on the Sverdlovsk are considerably higher, and the production 
cost is much lower than on BAM, this polarity in financial 
results can be explained only by the absence of objective 
criteria for formulating accounting prices. 
  The identical level of profitability incorporated in 
accounting prices gives the advantage to roads which have a high 
production cost. For example, passenger transport is 
unprofitable. The size of the losses are tremendous, but 
meanwhile, given the existing formulation of accounting prices, 
the roads performing the largest volume of passenger transport 
are the most profitable. Is this not a paradox? The time is not 
only ripe, but over-ripe for a return to the tariff principle of 
distribution. Today even with unified tariffs the obvious 
economic problems can be solved through the Russian government. 
  If BAM, for example, with the present tariffs, is 
unprofitable, everyone should know about it. The size of its 
losses should be known precisely. Today, however, reliable, and 
moreover accessible information on the economic situation of the 
railroads is practically non-existent. After all, every director 
wants to see the situation of his own road against the 
background of others, in order to evaluate the success of his 
actions and to determine the problems that require joint efforts. 
  The Sverdlovsk Mainline proposed its own variant -- 
territorially differentiated tariffs. To accelerate their 
introduction one must take a look at practical experience and 
see what is happening as a result of this on individual 
sections. Let us say, with the next indexing of freight tariffs, 
by decision of the Russian Committee on Prices, a virtual 
coefficient is established for the Tobolsk-Surgut section, and 
so on, the road having been granted the right to exact and 
direct toward its income the corresponding additional carriage 
charge accompanying the dispatch and arrival of freight. 
  A proposal was also introduced on rescinding the material 
responsibility of the roads for failure to adhere to the limit 
for financing transit roads. The road collectives should not 
bear the responsibility for the imperfection of the income 
distribution system. Wages constitute a large part of the 
operating expenses, and therefore, given the continuing 
recession in transport, one must not avoid taking note of this 
part of the expenses. 
  This problem will be solved, in the first place through 
changing the work conditions for low-activity sections and 
stations, leaving the reserves of refrigerator rolling stock and 
the locomotive fleet alone, and taking organizational and 
technological measures. Today, however, although this question 
was also raised at the MPS Collegium, there is no proper basis 
for norms determining the number of workers on the basis of the 
drop in transport volumes and the accounting fund for labor 
wages. Many of the existing normatives and norms for service 
have grown obsolete and are unsuitable for the present-day 
situation. 
  Meanwhile, dissonance is introduced by the main 
administrations, which sometimes instruct the roads to increase 
the number of individual categories of workers and demand that 
certain technological and other structural subdivisions be newly 
created. Every road acts on its own here. For example, the 
Sverdlovsk has put the emphasis on improving labor organization, 
and has used home duty, a fragmented work day, combining jobs 
within an enterprise and a short work day. All this, of course, 
was approved by the trade union. The assembly proposed that the 
existing tariff rates and wages on the railroads be reduced to 
unified rates and wages, established for the network according 
to the vocational qualifications of groups of workers, based on 
differences and difficulty, in accordance with the Tariff 
Agreement. 
  Under the conditions of the sharp drop in the transport 
volume, the problem of setting quotas for the railcar fleet is a 
very urgent one. On the roads, the non-operating fleet -- MPS 
reserves, technological reserves, railcars belonging on spur 
tracks and those not in good working order -- sometimes exceed 
the operating fleet. The quota as a norm determining the minimum 
maintenance of the total railcar fleet for the volume of 
operations has lost its regulatory function. The station tracks 
are literally crammed with excess rolling stock. Under these 
conditions, an above-quota payment is added to the roads' 
additional expenditures to maintain an excess fleet, which 
should be compensated in accordance with a centralized 
procedure. It turns out that a road is penalized twice. 
  It was therefore proposed that the financial responsibility 
of the railroads for adherence to the quota be eliminated, since 
the roads are virtually devoid of any possibility of regulating 
the fleets to adjust them to the established norm. The classic 
indicators for the use of rolling stock -- such as "work car 
turnover" -- are also obsolete. 
  On transferring part of the locomotive fleet to other roads. 
How many documents have the main administrations passed, but 
there have been no substantial changes. For example, V. 
Predybaylov, chief of the Northern Railroad, complained that 
there are not enough diesel locomotives on the mainline, while 
there is an excess of electric locomotives. Another road uses 
old ones, which long ago worked out their motor life, such as 
VL22 electric locomotives. These problems, of course would be 
more easily solved by the road directors than through the main 
administrations, as is done today. 
  "This assembly is distinguished from others by the fact that 
the Sverdlovsk has shown us the way a road interacts with the 
VPK [military-industrial complex]," said I. Paristyy, chief of 
the Moscow Railroad. 
  We have already told, on the pages of GUDOK, of the goods 
produced by the Machine Building Plant imeni Kalinin. The visit 
made to Uralvagonzavod left no lesser impression on the 
participants in the assembly. The road chiefs were already 
familiar with many of the items of the "railcar maker" -- 
gondolas, tank cars with up-to-date modifications, in no way 
inferior to foreign analogs -- these are, so to speak, purely 
railroad items. But the forklift trucks, excavators and 
agricultural equipment for home vegetable gardens -- these were 
really impressive. The meeting with V. Seryakov, director of the 
Uralvagonzavod Production Association, was also interesting. 
  At Kamensk-Uralskiy, the assembly participants visited the 
Oktyabr Production Association, and familiarized themselves with 
the latest innovations in the aircraft industry and, of course, 
with the production of an automatic locomotive braking control 
system (SAUT-II), on the development of which scientists from 
VNIIZhT [All-Union Railroad Transport Scientific Research 
Institute] and Oktyabr specialists collaborated. 
  "We obtained a great deal of valuable information, related 
not only to stabilizing the sector's economy, but also to 
solving many practical problems on the Sverdlovsk Mainline," 
noted A. Ivanov, chief of the Far Eastern Railroad. "I, a 
student of the Ural school, am proud that the Sverdlovsk 
Railroad is giving an example of the way one must operate under 
today's difficult conditions."

<F P=106> [Article by Denis Molchanov: "View From the Regions"] </F>
  [Text] "Reforms in Russia--View From the Regions"--this is 
the title of the latest report from the All-Russian Center for 
Study of Public Opinion [VTsIOM] prepared with assistance from 
the Friedrich Ebert Fund (Germany). 
  Specialists of the VTsIOM and the Ebert Fund polled about 
400 
business leaders in 12 regional centers of Russia: chiefs of 
administrations, mayors of cities, directors of enterprises, 
merchants, bankers, and stock brokers. These people's views on 
the problems of separation of power, the development of Russian 
federalism, and the division of authority between the center and 
the provinces were the subject of the sociologists' study. It is 
customary to think that the opinion of the oblast leader carries 
weight only after it makes its way to Moscow--over seven decades 
it has become so firmly set in our brains that we frequently 
overlook statements from "provincials." And we take notice only 
when the justifiably offended region proclaims itself to be the 
"center." 
  Scholars are supposed to be intelligent in that they are the 
first to recognize the tendencies in the development of society. 
Clearly aware of who will be the main force in the forthcoming 
extra or regular presidential elections, sociologists have 
decided to insure themselves ahead of time against surprises 
like the one that occurred on 12 December of last year. And it 
seems that they have achieved a certain amount of success. I am 
thinking of the information that 
  --as a country that could serve as an example for Russia in 
economic development, China was named in first place, then came 
Western Europe and Japan, and the United States came only after 
that, 
  --two-thirds of those questioned think that Russia's economy 
should be a unified organism, 
  --85 percent of businessmen think that all regions of the 
country must have the same degree of independence and autonomy, 
and only 11 percent think that the regions densely populated by 
non-Russian nationalities should have a special national status, 
  --when evaluating the attempt at the putsch in Moscow during 
3-4 October 1993, 40 percent of those questioned think what 
happened was a "predictable outcome of the resistance of the 
Supreme Soviet to the democratic transformations and market 
reforms." One-third think that the putsch was organized by 
political and military adventurists and the legislative and 
executive powers were drawn into it. And 27 percent think that 
this was an "authoritarian coup of the Yeltsin government which 
eliminated the parliamentary branch of power and established a 
dictatorship," 
  --on the whole almost half of the businessmen in Russia 
assess the political situation in Russia as a loss of order, 
growth of anarchy, etc. 
  What do you think of the course of the political reforms in 
the country? 
  [Following are converted from bar graphs] 
  The reforms should be continued, but gradually, without 
shock 
measures and increasing the social protection of the 
population--66 percent. 
  The reforms should be continued using more radical measures 
than at present--23.7 percent. 
  Which of our society's domestic problems are bothering you 
most now? 
  the weakness and helplessness of state power--45.2 percent 
  the growth of the number of crimes--45 percent 
  the growth of prices--33.2 percent 
  the crisis of ethics, culture, and morality--31.9 percent 
  the disintegration of economic ties among the republics of 
the former Union--31.7 percent 
  the threat of mass unemployment--20.4 percent 
  the corruption of representatives of the state 
apparatus--20.4 percent 
  the aggravation of national conflicts--10.8 percent 
  the threat of a dictatorship--8.5 percent 
  the deterioration of the condition of the environment--7.8 
percent 
  the shortage of food products and necessities--3.5 percent 
  the abandonment of the ideals of socialism--2 percent. 
  Tell us, please, which economic system seems to you to be 
the 
most correct for Russia? 
  the one based on private property and market relations--72.2 
percent 
  difficult to answer--15.2 percent 
  the one based on state planning and distribution--12.7 
percent. 
  In your opinion, which of the business leaders and 
economists 
have the correct idea of how to lead Russia out of the economic 
crisis? 
  Yavlinskiy--42.7 percent 
  Gaydar--19.1 percent 
  Volskiy--13.3 percent 
  Travkin--8 percent 
  Chernomyrdin--7.8 percent 
  Shakhray--6.5 percent 
  B. Fedorov--6.3 percent 
  Abalkin--5.3 percent 
  Ryzhkov--5.3 percent 
  Borovoy--3.5 percent 
  Shatalin--3.5 percent

<F P=106> [Own information report: "Russian Machinebuilding is </F>
Planning 36-Percent Growth by the Year 2000"] 
  [Text] By the year 2000 the volume of production in the 
machinebuilding complex, including TNP [food and consumer goods] 
will grow, in comparable prices, to 2543.4 billion rubles [R] as 
opposed to R1546.5 billion in 1992. Vladimir Kubantsev, chief 
of the department for long-range development of the State 
Institute for Designing Heavy and Transport Machinebuilding 
Plants, announced this. He presented the plan for the 
development of machinebuilding to the year 2000, worked out by 
the leading design institutes of eight machinebuilding sectors, 
at the 5 April session of the Russian Machinebuilding 
Committee's scientific-technical council. The average growth of 
production, according to the forecast, will comprise 36 percent 
from 1996-2000. The greatest growth is expected in the 
automobile industry, tractor and agricultural machinebuilding 
and instrument building. According to the plan for long-range 
development of machinebuilding adopted by the council, the cost 
of industrial-production fixed capital will increase from 
R1367.1 billion in 1992 to R2181.9 billion in 2000. The 
greatest average annual growth of fixed capital is predicted for 
the automobile industry (56 percent for the period 1996-2000). 
The forecasters determined that capital investment in the years 
1996-2000 will be R1071.7 billion, including R418.3 billion for 
construction-installation work. During this time the number of 
personnel, comprising 2.647 million people in 1992, will 
practically not change by the year 2000.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yu. Arkhipov, by A. Bayduzhiy, under the </F>
rubric "Problem": "Russia Has Become a Mecca for Illegal 
Migrants: According to Yuriy Arkhipov, Head of the Foreign 
Migration Administration of the Federal Migration Service, This 
Benefits the West"] 
  [Text] 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] One of the tokens of recent times has 
been the mounting flow into Russia of citizens of states that 
only recently were called Third World countries. How many 
refugees from the far abroad are there on Russian territory? 
  [Arkhipov] Here we need to clarify concepts. From the legal 
point of view, it is not refugees coming to Russia but people 
wishing to claim refugee status. They can become refugees only 
after the appropriate procedure, which assumes submitting a 
petition to the migration services, lodging of the petitioner at 
a temporary housing center, and verifying the data given in the 
claimant's declaration. Only after this can the individual be 
recognized a refugee and be issued a refugee certificate for 
Russian territory. Foreigners who have not gone through all 
these steps are not considered refugees and are on the country's 
territory illegally. According to data from the health care 
organs, such immigrants from the far abroad here number more 
than half a million, and their number continues to grow. Every 
day up to a hundred new illegal migrants arrive in Russia. 
  As for official refugees, here the situation is somewhat 
confused. Before Russia joined the 1951 UN Convention on the 
Status of Refugees in 1992, there were a significant number of 
foreigners on Russian territory who flooded in uncontrollably 
due to the openness of our borders with certain new states of 
the Trans-Caucasus and Central Asian regions. At the same time, 
the office of the Administration of the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugee Affairs (UVKB OON), which without the consent of the 
Russian organs of power began to undertake the massive reception 
of immigrants from the far abroad, issuing its own certification 
as "requiring asylum in the Russian Federation," began 
operations in Moscow. Most of the migrants had counted on the 
assistance of the UVKB OON primarily to move to the developed 
countries of Western Europe and Scandinavia. 
  There are about 50,000 such UVKB-registered individuals in 
Russia. Since our country joined the convention, all of them, 
according to this organization's office, must be recognized 
almost automatically as refugees on Russian territory. 
Naturally, we cannot agree to this. 
  Right now the Federal Migration Service is carrying out a 
reregistration of those registered by UVKB representatives, and 
in the process many violations have been uncovered: some of the 
migrants have two certificates; others' documents have changed 
hands more than once; and certificates have been issued without 
dates or numbers and without individual files being opened on 
them. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Which means, if you don't count the 
individuals registered by the UVKB, there are officially still 
no refugees from the far abroad in Russia? 
  [Arkhipov] Absolutely correct. The Russian law "On Refugees" 
provides that an individual who has arrived on our territory 
must immediately declare himself as seeking asylum in Russia. We 
have many migrants who entered the country three or four years 
ago and have been living on Russian territory in the hopes of 
leaving by any means possible for other countries and who are 
involved in semi-legal business operations. They make themselves 
known only when they have dealings with the lawkeeping organs, 
or if they are unsuccessful in getting to the West. So in what 
capacity can we consider them? As people seeking asylum, 
refugees, or, more likely, as illegal migrants? However, the 
Western states and the UVKB OON ignore the nonstandard situation 
in Russia, believing that we are intentionally dragging our 
heels about giving these individuals refugee status. Here it 
should be noted that as soon as Russia joined the convention, 
literally a week later, seven Western states tightened up their 
visa procedures. That is, they made our country virtually the 
last. The West profits if this great mass of refugees from the 
Third World stays in Russia, which protects the West from their 
penetration. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] So joining the convention was a 
mistake 
on Russia's part? 
  [Arkhipov] When it was being signed, we were evidently 
counting on the West beginning to assist the Russian-speaking 
population that had started to arrive on Russian territory in 
massive proportions. However, these hopes were not vindicated. 
According to the Western states, the Russian-speaking citizens 
arriving here were not refugees, unlike the Somalian, Kurdish, 
and African migrants, for example. That is, in joining the 
convention, we did not take into account the political, 
economic, social, or moral-psychological consequences of this 
step. According to our assessments, the cost of maintaining a 
single family of migrants from the far abroad from the moment 
they cross the border until the decision is made on whether or 
not to present them with refugee status (according to the law, 
this should take three months) comes to more than 3 million 
rubles. Naturally, that kind of money is nowhere to be found. 
Our country's doctors have proved unfamiliar with many of the 
diseases from which the African and Asiatic refugees suffer, and 
it is difficult to control them. For instance, as a result of 
tests on migrants registered by the UVKB, several people 
infected with the AIDS virus were discovered who later 
disappeared and whom we have never been able to locate. 
  One more miscalculation turned out to be the fact that 
Russia 
has become nearly the sole state in the world to join the 
convention on refugee status and its protocol in full. The 
United States joined only the protocol; other states signed the 
convention after setting many qualifications, thanks to which 
they can refuse to implement some of its conditions. Moreover, 
Russia has gone even further. The law "On Refugees" passed in 
Russia is broader than the convention, which has evoked surprise 
even among international experts. Much more developed countries 
would not have permitted themselves this. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] But at one time passage of the Russia 
law "On Refugees" was offered up to us as a major accomplishment 
in the sphere of guaranteeing human rights. Now it is judged 
differently? 
  [Arkhipov] By the law's appearance, yes; but by its content, 
not entirely. The law proved more declaratory than really 
effective. A certain hastiness in its passage in the existing 
edition led to many legal gaps and disparities. It lacks any 
reference whatsoever to a mechanism for offering refugee status. 
It turns out that in order to obtain the latter, a foreigner 
only has to submit a statement. Imagine the cost of the standard 
implied by the law providing for offering refugees housing "from 
a special housing fund designated for refugees," which no one 
had created at the time the law came out! And so forth. Right 
now we have prepared, based on the experience we have, and sent 
out for approval, amendments to the law "On Refugees" and forced 
resettlers. The excessively expansive--in comparison with the 
convention--interpretation of refugee status has been deleted, a 
procedure for offering that status has been introduced, and not 
only the rights of refugees but also the rights of the state 
with respect to them have been set forth more precisely. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Does Russia have centers for work with 
refugees from the far abroad? 
  [Arkhipov] Not yet. So far we have not managed to create 
them, not only for economic reasons but also due to the sharply 
negative attitude of local authorities and the population. Right 
now preparations are being completed for opening the first such 
center in Perm Oblast, and altogether there are plans for up to 
10-12 regional centers for temporary lodging. This is a 
half-closed institution, where foreigners will be located to 
ensure their safety under guard. We cannot allow huge masses of 
people who do not know the languages or rules of the country and 
who, it has to be admitted, treat our laws with extreme 
negligence to resettle at will across Russia. But here another 
problem arises. The majority of the migrants from the far abroad 
are concentrated in Moscow and under no circumstances do they 
wish to leave it. Recently we suggested that a group of Kurds 
resettle in Tver, and en route half of them ran away. Are these 
refugees? If the police have to be sent to catch someone, then 
this is not a refugee but an illegal migrant, and adequate 
measures must be taken, up to and including deportation. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] For some reason I haven't heard 
anything about even a single case of such deportation or 
expulsion. 
  [Arkhipov] For this you have to ask the passport and visa 
service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which is supposed 
to deal with the deportation of citizens found illegally on 
Russian territory. Although, as far as I know, in 1993, there 
were a few instances of citizens of China and Vietnam being 
expelled from Russia. In general, the deportation process right 
now in many ways makes no sense: you can spend millions of 
rubles on the expulsion of foreign citizens, but tomorrow, given 
our open borders, they will turn up in Moscow again. 
Deportations are not going to solve the problem of illegal 
migration. We must come to an agreement as quickly as possible 
with the states of the former USSR, either on establishing 
strict visa control along the perimeter of the CIS, or else on 
stopping the transit of migrants to Russia through those 
countries. And naturally, Russian passports must be introduced.

<F P=106> [Article by B. Bronshteyn, IZVESTIYA correspondent: "KamAZ: </F>
A Year After the Fire"] 
  [Text] Naberezhnye Chelny--Exactly one year ago, on 
14 April, the largest enterprise of the KamAZ joint-stock 
company--an engine plant--burned nearly to the ground. 
  Since the tragedy, KamAZ has received the Golden Globe, an 
award from the American Fund for Eastern Development, for its 
high level of production, and the Diamond Star, a prize for 
quality from Mexican industrialists. The auto giant was included 
in the catalog "The Elite of Russian Business"--"Darin-94," and 
its general director, Nikolay Bekh, is listed in Who's Who, a 
world encyclopedia representing 5000 outstanding individuals in 
the world. Not bad for someone whose lost everything in a fire, 
is it? 
<H5>  The Iron Phoenix </H5>
  Naturally, things are not going all that brilliantly at 
KamAZ, despite all the awards and honors. Moreover, according to 
some indicators (for example, for solvency), things are simply 
bad. The main thing that they have managed to prove in the past 
difficult year, however, is KamAZ's capacity for self-renewal 
and self-development, and in conditions of general economic 
chaos, moreover, which is scarcely better than a fire. 
  IZVESTIYA has spoken to its readers about the progress of 
the 
restoration of the engine plant, but it would not be out of 
place to repeat that this work, impressive for both scale and 
tempo, was accomplished with minimal assistance from the state. 
KamAZ had been promised 50 billion rubles (R) of gratuitous 
assistance; R18 billion were allocated. Matters also went badly 
with credits: KamAZ again received R18 billion per year at a 170 
percent rate of interest. Even so, last autumn engine assembly 
started up at the restored (and fantastically re-equipped) 
plant. The restoration of this production took, apart from 
enthusiasm, R150 billion and $150 million. Understandably, KamAZ 
is up to its ears in debt. Suffice it to say that it owes 
upwards of R70 billion to the builders responsible for the 
restoration work, who are counting on the authority and 
stability of KamAZ, which will not let them down and will pay 
them when things ease up. 
  KamAZ's salvation throughout this very difficult period has 
been that it never ceased operation. By assembling vehicles and 
selling them, the joint-stock company took in about R50 billion 
every month. For many, the idea of putting out trucks without 
power units was surprising, but, strange though it seems, there 
was a steady demand for them for several months. After all, many 
buyers had engines in reserve, and others were able to obtain 
them from service operations. Moreover, as has already been 
reported, KamAZ had efficiently arranged for the assembly of 
engines at others of its enterprises, if only on a small scale. 
  There were times when the assembly line would come to a halt 
for short periods of time, but the hardest times already seem to 
be behind them. Today at KamAZ they are assembling 150 vehicles 
a day (they need to make 400 to do well), they have finally paid 
salaries for January and February, and they are starting to talk 
about paying the March salary. True, as before, many workers in 
the forging and casting plants are on mandatory leave. However, 
even here there has been an improvement in the situation: KamAZ 
now has the funds to acquire pig iron and aluminum, and by May 
the plants may be supplied with the resources to meet at least 
half their needs. 
  Here it is appropriate to speak about another large debt of 
KamAZ--to the supplier plants. Since the auto plant has nothing 
to pay them with, they are not supplying parts. At KamAZ, there 
are now hundreds of incomplete trucks stowed away (in March 
there were 3500). Therefore the April program might seem 
somewhat strange: assemble 2000 vehicles and sell 3000. That is, 
the plan is to pull out an extra 1000 and finish them. And in 
general, to pay off their partners and restore the supply 
system, now the chief task, which is no easier to carry out than 
rebuilding a burned out plant. 
<H5>  The View Through the Windshield </H5>
  So, now the ashes and the gigantic building site can only be 
seen with the help of a rear-view mirror. But what kind of 
prospects open up with the view through the windshield? 
  There is no bad without good, and the problem that arose 
with 
the engines forced the KamAZ directors to take absolutely 
revolutionary decisions, in particular, the agreement with the 
American firm Cummings. This partnership was conceived of back 
in 1991, after the privatization of KamAZ. Energetic and 
purposeful actions afterthe fire by the people at Naberezhnye 
Chelny proved yet again to their foreign partners that they 
could do business with KamAZ. As the American press noted, the 
Cummings Company decided to stand back from the principle of 
slow rapprochement, speed up the deal, and expand the scale of 
the collaboration. As a result, it was decided to build an 
engine plant jointly at Naberezhnye Chelny that will produce up 
to 50,000 motors a year. Construction is slated for 1996, and in 
the meantime American engines are being installed into 
Naberezhnye Chelny trucks designated primarily for export. For 
our consumer they are rather expensive. 
  We know that KamAZ today is not only trucks. More and more 
on 
our roads one comes across the Naberezhnye Chelny-produced, 
limited-run Oka, which at one time was nearly called the Kama. 
Last year, which was so unsuccessful for the Naberezhnye Chelny 
people, KamAZ put out 6000 passenger cars, increasing their 
production over 1992 by 40 percent. As the plant's director for 
passenger vehicles, Oleg Belonenko, told the IZVESTIYA 
correspondent, the assembly line is just about to move to the 
new building, where capacities for 50,000 motor vehicles a year 
are being created. 
  "We financed the construction of this building out of our 
own 
funds," he said. "In this sense the fire did not affect 
expansion of production. You know, it's nice to hear that 
someone is encouraging production when everyone around him is 
undermining it." 
  Not everyone knows, probably, that a program to put out city 
buses, the KamAZ-5262, is beginning to be implemented at 
Naberezhnye Chelny. An experimental model has already been 
tested in Kazan, and Mintimer Shaymiyev, the president of 
Tatariya, has already ridden in it. The bus is roomy, designed 
for 120 passengers (it is not hard to guess that when the 
president is not on board, a good 240 will squeeze in). The 
first industrial lot of 100 buses is expected to be put out this 
year, and in general the program is calculated for 10,000 
vehicles a year. 
  In short, as Nikolay Bekh, general director of the 
Naberezhnye Chelny auto giant, says, KamAZ is eternal and will 
live forever. True, some of Nikolay Ivanovich's subordinates 
feel that he frequently manifests excessive optimism, but it is 
better to have an optimist-director then a pessimist--you get 
nothing but melancholy from those pessimists. 
  In conclusion, a couple of words on the fire. Evidently, the 
accident taught the KamAZ people something. Reports on the 
laying of the roof on the restored plant indicate that anti-fire 
zones are being put in (previously there had not been a trace of 
them). In addition, there is information to the effect that 
KamAZ for the first time intends to insure its 
multi-billion-ruble property according to Western 
standards--something which, apart from everything else, its 
foreign partners are insisting upon. This is probably right: you 
cannot trust to chance or to lightning not striking in the same 
place twice.

<F P=106> [Article by P. Budnitskiy, sector director of the RF </F>
Economics Ministry's Council on Productive Forces: "Russia, Do 
You Know This Itch?: What We Have, We Don't Hold on To"] 
  [Text] More and more oil, natural gas, copper, and 
nickel are being exported to the West from Russia for next to 
nothing. The income is coming to rest in foreign banks. Who is 
going to put a halt to this economic self-exhaustion? And how? 
According to the author of this article, we must restore 
legislatively the state monopoly on the mineral trade--if only 
for 10 years or so. 
  Reform of the Russian economy started out to the slogan 
about the need for structural perestroyka. What is its 
intermediate result? In 1993, the raw materials component of 
Russian exports to the far abroad rose to 86 percent, whereas in 
1990 the proportion of raw materials in exports was a little 
more than 60 percent. This means that structural perestroyka 
still has a strongly expressed negative significance. 
  The increase in the export of raw materials from Russia is 
proceeding at the expense of domestic consumption. Domestic 
consumption of oil over the last three years has declined by 40 
percent, and of natural gas by 22 percent; nonetheless, official 
export (not counting contraband export) of these products for 
this period increased by 4 and 20 percent, respectively. An 
analogous situation is taking shape with metals, cellulose, 
ammonia, mineral fertilizers, and so on. 
  Export from Russia is going to grow. The increased cost of 
imports will tend to limit the number of solvent purchasers and, 
consequently, to cut the volume of imports themselves. If these 
processes are not halted, the physical volumes of raw materials 
exports will grow--to the point of completely exhausting our 
reserves of the types of raw materials, semi-manufactured items, 
and metals being exported. 
  In addition, we are seeing a relative increase in the cost 
of 
capital stock in devalued hard currency and a decline in the 
price for manpower. The foundations for any possible industrial 
development will be undermined in that part and the private 
sector. 
  Russia has been in a similar situation before, during the 
NEP 
(New Economic Policy), when private entrepreneurship was choked 
out precisely due to a lack of raw materials. In those years, up 
to 80 percent of the raw material resources were exported from 
Russia. Liberalization of foreign economic activity led to the 
majority of enterprises in the mining complex, independently or 
through the SP [joint enterprises], MP [small enterprises], and 
so on, entering the foreign market. 
  The foreign economic turnover of these enterprises is 
subject 
to virtually no accounting. According to various data, export of 
hard currency received primarily from the sale of nonrenewable 
resources and primary output from them totaled $40-45 billion 
over the last two years. 
  The scale of sanctioned and contraband export of raw 
materials resources is leading to a sharp decline in prices for 
many types of raw materials resources. Prices for copper, 
nickel, and aluminum on the London metals market have fallen in 
1993 in comparison with 1990 by 22, 42, and 31 percent, 
respectively. 
  Most worrisome, however, is this: the normal work of the oil 
and gas, metallurgical, fuel and energy complexes, and chemical 
and lumber processing industry--the main suppliers of hard 
currency to the Russian Federation (RF)--depend to a significant 
extent on imported equipment and spare parts for that equipment. 
Due to the "price scissors" (low prices for raw materials and 
high prices for equipment), the quantity of raw materials being 
exported is growing steadily. The increase in the cost of 
imported equipment is simply frightening. If in the years 
1976-80 equipment worth $12 billion was bought for the Russian 
raw materials complex, and in the years 1981-85 about $20 
billion, then in the last 5-7 years, according to specialists' 
calculations, about $100 billion was needed. 
  Actually, the export of raw materials from Russia was 
also practiced immediately after the conclusion of the civil 
war. In the years 1933-34 (at the end of the Depression in the 
West), this process reached maximum proportions. Only in 1936 
did a decisive decline in raw materials export begin. For 
approximately 10-12 years after the end of World War II, raw 
materials were virtually not exported abroad from the USSR at 
all. This specifically may have been one of the reasons for the 
complete restoration of the USSR's industrial potential by 1954, 
something the majority of Western analysts thought would take 
Russia at least 30 years. 
  An equally alarming situation is taking shape in what is for 
Russia a new economic process--the sale of the rights to 
prospect for and work mineral deposits, or simply--the sale of 
our depths. At the present time, it is in the raw materials 
sector of the Russian economy that elevated investor activity 
has been noted. However, Russian interests are virtually not 
considered at all in raw materials plans, which envisage taking 
abroad the raw materials and the profit received from their 
sale. Reinvestment of the profit into Russia's economy is not 
being considered at all in these plans. 
  The absence of an elaborated mechanism for holding 
competitions for the right to prospect and work Russian mineral 
deposits leads to incompetent, frequently only recently 
organized companies that are interested not in exploiting the 
deposit but in the resale of the licenses to work them receiving 
licenses. 
  The loss of state control over utilization of the mineral 
and 
raw materials base and over reliable resource provision for the 
country is becoming very real. This could lead to the total 
collapse of Russia's economy and, as a consequence, to the loss 
of the state's economic and political independence. 
  Russian legislation on regulating mineral use is limited 
essentially to the RF Law "On Mineral Wealth" and a series of 
resolutions by the Supreme Soviet. In the United States, on the 
other hand, a country with developed market relations, the 
number of laws actually reinforcing the state's priorities in 
the use of the national raw materials base is almost 10. I will 
list only a few of them: the law on national policy in the 
sphere of materials and minerals; the Mining Code; the law on 
strategic resources. . . . The Bureau of Mines, which is part of 
the Department of the Interior, takes care of the planning 
("marketers," who shudder at the mention of this word, should 
forgive me) for prospecting and for opening up national mineral 
and raw materials resources in the United States. 
  Within the framework of forming and implementing RF raw 
materials policy, the state must be secured by law the priority 
right to dispose of mineral wealth. In all joint and wholly 
foreign plans for opening up Russian mineral wealth, the portion 
of the raw materials and profit that is going to be taken out of 
Russia must be carefully discussed in order to allow us to 
determine the volumes of funds for reinvestment into Russia's 
economy. 
  In prerevolutionary Russia, foreign entrepreneurs were 
allowed to take out a little more than 12 percent of the raw 
materials they mined or the profit received from their sale. 
Naturally, no one could take the remainder of the profit away 
from them: legislation proposed that they use this capital for 
the development of the Russian economy. And they agreed to this. 
Many even took Russian citizenship. 
  In order to avoid mistakes in taking decisions on 
large-scale 
raw materials projects, it is essential, first of all, to 
determine how the exploitation of a given natural deposit 
corresponds to Russia's long-term financial, social, raw 
materials, and other interests. This has to be done on the basis 
of a study of the current state of affairs in the market, taking 
into consideration the Russia's changing requirements for a 
given type of raw material and their reserves. Secondly, to 
assess the geopolitical aspect, taking into account the 
influence of the working of a specific deposit on the world 
production of any resource now and in the future. 
  When these issues are decided, a group of deposits will be 
determined whose exploitation will not substantially affect 
Russia's domestic and geopolitical interests. This group can be 
put up for auction. But in such a way that Russia set its own 
conditions, and the companies compete in offering the conditions 
most advantageous to us. 
  The most decisive step must be taken in the sphere of 
foreign 
trade. The state monopoly on foreign trade in mineral raw 
materials must be restored legislatively for a minimum of 10 
yeas. The need for this step can be explained by the fact that 
in the current situation only a state monopoly will permit the 
halting of what is essentially the contraband export of capital 
from the country on a scale that is at the very least 
humiliating for a great country. 
  I think that our raw materials giants have to realize 
the complexity of the situation and reconcile themselves to the 
necessity for a state monopoly on foreign trade in raw 
materials. Otherwise, in the event of Russia's loss of economic 
and political independence, these joint-stock companies, 
concerns, and so on will be transformed, in the best case, into 
branches of Shell, BHP, and others of that ilk. 
  One of the main lines of use for this money, undoubtedly, is 
conversion. Not "landslide" conversion, like now, but sensible 
conversion. A gradual decrease in the volume of equipment 
imported for the raw materials complex, to be compensated for by 
the production of it in enterprises of the military-industrial 
complex, will make it possible to decrease the share of 
mineral-raw material and fuel-energy components in the structure 
of Russian exports. 
  The prerequisites for the development of a progressive 
structure for the RF economy will appear. State raw materials 
policy must become (and one would like to believe necessarily 
will become) the basis for real structural perestroyka.

March 1994 "On the steps to complete construction of the 
Boguchansk GES " signed by V. Chernomyrdin] 
  [Text] In order to speed up completion of 
construction on the Boguchansk GES [State Electric Power 
Station] and put the first two hydraulic turbogenerator units of 
this station into operation in 1997, the Russian Federation 
Government decrees: 
  1. That the proposal by the Ministry of Economics, Ministry 
of Finance, Ministry of Fuel and Energy, and Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations of the Russian Federation, the Russian Power 
Engineering and Electrification Joint-Stock Company, and the 
administration of Krasnoyarsk Kray on completing construction of 
the Boguchansk GES with power transmission lines is approved.

Council of Ministers and Government. 
  4. That the Russian Federation Ministry of Economics is to 
provide for the allocation of additional regional quotas to the 
administration of Krasnoyarsk Kray for the exportation of 
commodities produced in the kray's territory for which quotas 
have been set before the two hydraulic turbogenerator units are 
commissioned in 1997, so that the special-purpose foreign loans 
invested for construction of this station are repaid, and the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations is to 
ensure that the appropriate licenses are officially registered.

<F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Yurkov: "A Commentary in This </F>
Connection"] 
  [Text] There is no need to introduce the Boguchansk GES to 
RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA readers--this is the second year the newspaper 
has followed the progress of this Siberian construction project, 
and it tells readers regularly about how Siberian residents are 
faring. 
  Yuriy Sakharnov, the general director of BoguchanGESstroy, a 
friend of the newspaper and a writer for it, has traveled over 
half the world in search of loans: under the omnipotent duo in 
the former Russian Government--Ye. Gaydar and B. 
Fedorov--financing of the country's only power generation 
project of this size practically came to an end. We should have 
had the courage, persistence, and wisdom of the builder-patriot, 
who has new power generation construction projects in Uzbekistan 
and Siberia--in "that" life they were called All-Union shock 
projects--behind him; we should not despair, give up our life as 
a hopeless task and sell our professional talent to the nouveaux 
riches who are rapidly surrounding the capital with a "belt of 
millionaires"--cottages and villas. In our opinion, these are 
palaces and country estates for the wealthy, who have become 
rich by completely doing away with social protection for the 
people. 
  Sakharnov found understanding in RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA. The 
newspaper reported on the situation at the construction site, it 
told about the collective which did not receive wages for months 
but did not abandon the work that was begun, and it told about 
the monetarist ministers who wanted to force Russia to live from 
day to day--to abandon the mines, the plants, the factories, and 
the construction sites... Then Arkadiy Volskiy and the entire 
Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs heard Sakharnov. 
Sensible heads also were found in the Russian Federation 
Government, and they understood and realized that Russia has 
been and continues to be held together by the might of three 
complexes--the military-industrial, fuel and energy, and 
machinebuilding complexes. One of them--the machinebuilding 
complex--has been lost, we believe. Since it is already being 
shifted, the VPK [military-industrial complex] has been 
castrated. And it is a fact that Russia is now living by the 
grace of the fuel and energy complex, obtaining not only energy 
resources, but foreign exchange from it as well. And Viktor 
Chernomyrdin is being openly defamed for his traditional 
sympathy for this, by the way. 
  After becoming familiar with BoguchanGESstroy operations at 
the site, Vice Premier A. Shokhin came to the unequivocal 
conclusion thast construction of the power station cannot be 
discontinued if we have a responsible attitude toward 
maintaining and building up the country's power generation 
potential. Yu. Safranik, the minister in charge of the fuel and 
energy complex, held a similar position. 
  It would appear that everyone is for it, but who is opposed 
to it? But month after month went by, and the prepared and 
approved drafts were not turned into actual documents. The 
all-powerful bureaucratic guarantee impeded execution of the 
directives from higher authorities and political intrigues 
overcame the common sense and economic strategy of the complex. 
The first vice premier should have had the character of Oleg 
Soskovets so as not to allow the document to be lost in the 
stratagems of intrigues and irresponsibility and to give hope 
not simply to the many thousands in the labor collective 
building the power station, but the entire energy complex; even 
during an economic emergency, the country cannot help but work 
toward tomorrow. For the loss of prospects means the loss of a 
future. 
  In a recent meeting at the RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA editorial 
office, Yu. Sakharnov was sitting at the same table with 
Vladislav Fronin, the chief editor of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, who 
had gotten his start in it as a literary staffer in the working 
youth department. Speaking in a humorous vein, he said it would 
be good to declare the Boguchansk GES an All-Union Komsomol 
shock project, then all the problems would be resolved. Well, 
that is bad luck--there is no more All-Union. Or Komsomol, 
either. 
  Unfortunately, many things that we are grieving about 
do not exist now. In seizing life from payday to payday, we have 
borrowed life. But after all, sooner or later the debt must be 
paid. Reproduction of our national heritage cannot be replaced 
by clearance sales. You cannot compensate for professional 
experience in building hydroelectric stations with the resources 
of a huge country by ultraradical incantations. In the final 
analysis, we are not stupid enough to reject what the entire 
enlightened world envied us, the Soviet people, for. 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA had already been criticized in this 
connection by sinister democratic newspapers when it began 
saying in the spring of 1992 that former fraternal republics in 
the former Soviet Union should not erect customhouses and cordon 
off their borders, but restore the ties that were broken, and 
reinforce, not destroy (!) the unified "fields"--the 
information, market, legal, financial, and other fields. And the 
ties of relationship should not be forgotten in the process. Not 
of leaders with leaders, but between our brides and "their" 
grooms. And vice versa. In short, we should not be scattering 
now, but running together. 
  In an interview with RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA at that time, 
Nursultan Nazarbayev first advanced the idea which is reflected 
today in the formula for a Eurasian Union. 
  So the idea advanced at the RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA table by 
Vladislav Fronin and seized upon by Yuriy Sakharnov, the builder 
of All-Union shock projects, impelled us to relive the past--to 
organize peripheral public supervision of the government's 
decree on the Boguchansk GES. It produced a satisfactory effect 
at one time. Is it suitable under the current conditions? Will 
it help the labor collective of hydroelectric station builders? 
  Yuriy Sakhanov is confident that it will help. 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, as a partner of long standing with 
Krasnoyarsk residents, is taking implementation of this 
government decree under public supervision. The newspaper will 
be informing the Russian public regularly how the construction 
is progressing, who is helping the Boguchan workers and how, who 
is impeding fulfillment of orders for construction of the 
Russian state's power generation facility, and how and why they 
are doing it. We will be naming those who contribute to the 
increase in power generation potential in Siberia and the 
country, and we will also name those who put spokes in the 
wheels of the Angara construction project. 
  So a start has been made. Everyone who has helped to bring 
about this decree through the responsibility of his service or 
simply through his duty as a citizen cannot be enumerated. But 
certain persons "behind the scenes" should be mentioned: 
  A. Volskiy, president of the Russian Union of Industrialists 
and Entrepreneurs [RSPP], and his new deputy, RSPP 
Vice-President B. Kurakin; A. Dyakov, president of the RAO 
[Russian Joint-Stock Company] "YeES Rossii"; V. Zyryakov, 
assistant to the first deputy chairman of the Russian Federation 
Council of Ministers and Government; Yu. Mikhaylov, a government 
adviser; V. Zubov, governor of Krasnoyarsk Kray; and Yu. Korsun, 
the deputy minister of fuel and energy. Of course, in first 
place we ought to name all the builders of the Boguchansk GES, 
as well as those who did not believe that the specialty of 
destroyer is valued more highly in Russia than a builder. Most 
likely not only this truth, but economic feasibility and 
political realism, have helped all those participating in this 
to join hands and form a circle of civil and patriotic harmony 
to rescue the work essential to everyone. 
  It is possible that some may be irritated by lines in 
my commentary: they may say the chief editor is singing like a 
nightingale, but where is the spring? Listing the names of 
lobbyists for a new Siberian construction project, for what 
purpose? 
  Why, in fact? 
  I honestly admit--without any purpose or malicious 
intent. It is simply pleasant to realize that there are persons 
in Russia who fight to the bitter end to prevent what we have 
built with our hands, the work of our life, from being 
destroyed. And it is pleasant to help them. If only in 
words. 
  And this is why I listed the names--there is a clear 
discrepancy here. Judge for yourselves. We journalists try for 
weeks and months to "extract" the surnames of those involved in 
bad dealings. And the more such names we have to our credit, the 
better our statement of service, it is believed. Perhaps it is 
better... It is as if we have forgotten how to say a kind word, 
as if it has fallen into disuse in our vocabulary and become 
unnecessary in our contacts with the public. 
  This is not true--it is more necessary today than under 
communism. 
  My words are not an indulgence for the remission of sins. 
Tomorrow we may present claims against O. Soskovets and V. 
Kurakin, and I hope they will understand this is how RABOCHAYA 
TRIBUNA operates. 
  Today, I hope they will understand this: we want the Russian 
people to turn to them when there are promising operations--they 
will help. Tell me, what is bad about this? If there are 
persons at all levels in Russia that can be depended upon today. 
  There is no more powerful means of strengthening authority, 
especially democratic authority, than the economic might of the 
state and social protection for its citizens. And any 
government, if it wants to be democratic and strong, will not 
give preference to destructive instead of constructive trends. 
It is awkward even to say this--it is a common truth for all 
times and peoples. 
  We remain to be convinced by a specific example: whether our 
executive authority is strong enough to realize a creative 
project. And there is no need to smile at a certain degree of 
extra passion in my commentary--yes, one swallow dos not make a 
spring. Especially as the decree is still not the GES. 
  This is the situation. And we are making a fuss because of 
this.

<F P=106> [Article by Doctor of Economic Sciences Z.G. Shirinskaya, </F>
professor of the Finance Academy of the Russian Federation 
Government, under the rubric "Commentary by a Specialist": "On 
Banks' Transition to International Accounting Standards"] 
  [Text] A shortage of skilled banking personnel, an obsolete 
chart of accounts, and the absence of a clear-cut regulatory 
base for the accounting and documentation of certain banking 
operations are problems that banks are encountering in the area 
of organization of accounting. A similar problem exists in 
methodological support for analysis of financial reports by 
banks. Under the new conditions, banking personnel should not 
only ensure that operations are reflected in accounts correctly, 
that is, that account-keeping is expert and professional, but 
also be capable of analyzing the financial reports they compile, 
thus participating in the management of the bank. 
  The difficult financial conditions under which domestic 
commercial banks operate at present: the inflationary 
depreciation of credit resources and equity capital, the 
stringent, restrictive policy of the Central Bank geared toward 
the contraction of credit resources and limitations on credit 
outlays, a tax policy that is not conducive to the development 
of banking--all these factors are prompting banking personnel to 
search for new ways to "survive," which in turn call for complex 
accounting solutions, choices, and substantiations of the 
patterns for registering operations which are new in principle 
in balance-sheet accounts. Among them is documentation of direct 
correspondent accounts which make it possible to solve the 
problem of not only speeding up client settlements but to a 
certain degree also those of interbank credit and the optimal 
centralized resource reservation. As a rule, these operations 
are combined with trust services to manage funds in clients' 
settlement and current accounts. It is necessary for banking 
personnel to grasp the essence and economic advantages of new 
technologies and management patterns for resources, liquidity, 
and risk, and their professional registration in balance-sheet 
reports. Deficiencies in the regulatory base for resolving many 
technical issues in bank accounting are expressed, in 
particular, in the failure to develop a mechanism for writing 
off long-defaulted loans and to determine the timing of such 
write-offs or for registering the sources of write-offs on the 
balance sheet (credit risk funds or the account "Profits and 
losses," as well as the schedule for accrual of interest on 
long-defaulted loans). It should also be kept in mind that banks 
are operating in an extremely difficult foreign economic 
environment with heightened risk. As a result, their credit 
portfolio is burdened by poor-quality credit. Credit personnel 
repeatedly prolongate poor-quality loans; they are not 
documented on the relevant balance-sheet accounts for the 
registration of defaulted loans. Bank reports documenting credit 
risks are becoming less and less authentic in this regard; their 
quality is deteriorating. In a number of banks, accounting 
personnel abandon the existing favorable tradition to 
participate in the monitoring of timely repayment of loans, 
their prolongation, or their assignment to the account of 
defaulted loans. The accounting of time obligations off the 
balance sheet, which was previously commonly accepted by banks, 
largely facilitated the performance of this monitoring function; 
a number of banks have recently abandoned such accounting 
without justification. As a result, operations to issue, repay, 
or prolong loans are concentrated in the hands of a narrow 
circle of individuals in credit directorates, which does not 
further the interests of either authentic reporting or bank 
security. 
  Accounting in commercial banks should be uniform, and should 
comply with international standards. The Central Bank has been 
taking clearly inadequate measures to speed up the transition to 
international accounting standards, to develop a banking 
infrastructure, and to ensure the security of document 
circulation. Perceiving tremendous financial losses due to the 
infiltration of forged advice notes, orders, checks, and so on 
into the circulation of documents, commercial banks are just 
beginning to engage in systematic work on comprehensive 
security, including computer security. In view of inadequate 
preparations and the absence of the necessary prerequisites for 
a transition to international accounting standards in commercial 
banks, two versions of proposals are being introduced: either 
incentives from the Central Bank for the voluntary assumption by 
the banks of obligations to switch to worldwide standards, or 
the use of just some of the standards used in world practice in 
the operations of domestic commercial banks. It appears that the 
latter noncomprehensive approach may entail unfavorable 
consequences. Thus, if reserves are not set aside in line with 
credit risk, the volume of reserves is understated, and 
simultaneously, accounting for defaulted loans is abandoned, and 
the loan obligations are practiced [as published] repeatedly and 
without substantiation, bank reports will not reflect real 
credit risks, and the balance will cease to be authentic. 
  The transition to international accounting standards by 
banks 
calls for producing, as soon as possible, a regulatory document 
on the organization of accounting at commercial banks which 
would be in line with banking legislation in effect. "Accounting 
and Reporting Rules" approved in 1987 are clearly obsolete and 
run counter to some of the laws of Russia, in particular, the 
Basic Civil Legislation, the Law "On Property in the Russian 
Federation," and the Law "On Banks and Banking." 
  The accounting rules provide the basis for the right of the 
Central Bank to debit funds from correspondent accounts of 
commercial banks without acceptance, which runs counter to the 
laws in question. According to legislation in effect, money can 
be debited from a correspondent bank account only on 
instructions from the bank itself or by decision of a people's 
court or arbitration panel. The right to debit without 
acceptance is actually assigned by the Central Bank to other 
organizations. In particular, in 1993 the Cash Union in Moscow 
enjoyed this right, which caused a strain on liquidity for many 
banks and ultimately resulted in large losses. 
  As can be seen, implementation of the transition to 
international accounting standards by banks has begun under 
difficult conditions for their operations. However, the issue of 
the need to harmonize accounting also affects banks in 
conjunction with the appearance of their most successfully 
operating segment on the world market and the inclusion of 
Russia in the process of worldwide economic integration. At the 
end of 1993 commercial banks embarked, on an experimental basis, 
on drawing up new financial reports and switching to new 
accounting standards. The task of improving the quality of 
accounting and the authenticity and dependability of bank 
reporting should be accomplished simultaneously. Some of the 
main accounting principles highlighting world standards are 
outlined below. 
  1. Continuity of operations. 
  In keeping with this standard, rules for keeping accounting 
records do not change if a bank plans to continue its operations 
in the foreseeable future and is not slated for liquidation. In 
the event of the projected elimination of branches or the sale 
of an asset, reports should reflect the hidden loss that will 
occur if the sales value of the assets in question turns out to 
be less than the residual value. 
  2. Fiscal year distribution. 
  Implementation of this principle requires that the banks 
register proceeds and expenditures as they are made, regardless 
of the time of the actual receipt of funds. Implementation of 
this principle will necessitate opening and keeping a new 
balance-sheet account "Accumulated profit plus deferred 
expenditures." The reporting of the bank should, as of 31 
December, indicate and register in the above account the 
accruing interest proceeds for the entire reporting month or 
year (rather than for the status as of 20 December, as is the 
case now). In the process, the client continues to pay accrued 
interest once a month (for example, on the 20th day of each 
month). At the same time, the cumulative interest outlay, 
regardless of the time of payment of interest on deposits, 
should be reflected in the above account in correspondence with 
the profit and loss account. 
  3. Prudence. 
  The principle of prudence requires that the assets and 
liabilities of banks be appraised realistically, with a 
sufficient degree of prudence, in order not to carry already 
existing risk over into subsequent years. This is particularly 
topical for Russian banks because it induces them to project 
credit risk and stimulates the generation of reserve funds that 
are adequate for the risk in terms of volume and timing. In 1994 
this principle was accepted by the Central Bank, and its 
implementation in the practice of commercial banks was 
recommended. With a view to accounting for credit risk 
provisions, account No. 945, with the same name, shall be opened 
on the balance sheets of banks; a reserve is generated out of 
operating expenditures (it does not influence the size of the 
base of taxation). The initial experience of reserve fund 
generation by commercial banks has revealed two problems. These 
are the striving to understate credit risk and, correspondingly, 
the size of reserve funds. In turn, this is largely due to the 
procedure for the generation of the fund established by the 
Central Bank according to which the volume of taxes paid by 
banks is not reduced, but the incentive funds and the dividend 
on shares are diminished. As a result, the entire effort to set 
aside reserve funds with a view to protecting the banks against 
the possible late repayment of loans by borrowers may turn out 
to be ineffective. Meanwhile, in international accounting, 
accounting entries for reserves of all types are made at the 
time the corresponding risks emerge, regardless of the 
availability or sufficiency of profits. According to 
international standards, profits cannot depend on tax policy, 
and tax rules should not influence accounting procedures for the 
operations of the bank. It should be taken into account that 
banks operate in a difficult economic environment, and that the 
bulk of the risk is associated precisely with economic 
instability. Under the circumstances, there are no adequate 
grounds for the recommendation of the Central Bank concerning 
the creation of credit risk reserves after determination of the 
base of taxation. Such reserves should be generated out of 
expenditures prior to determination of the base of taxation, in 
an amount in line with the risk. 
  Implementation of other international accounting standards, 
such as priority of content over form, constancy of accounting 
methods, openness (transparency), consolidation, and 
substantiveness will require great and serious effort and a high 
degree of professionalism on the part of accounting personnel. 
It is regrettable that the Central Bank refused to implement an 
international accounting standard proposed by the World Bank 
which requires that appropriate adjustments in reporting be made 
for the index of inflationary depreciation in the environment of 
hyperinflation (when the total rate of inflation in three years 
exceeds 100 percent). 
  The transition to international accounting standards should 
be accompanied by drawing up new financial reports. It includes 
a balance sheet drawn up on the basis of aggregated asset and 
liability items, an off-balance sheet report, and explanatory 
memorandums which should outline the bank's analytical effort to 
classify the credit portfolio and determine reserves and to 
manage resources, risk, and proceeds. 
  Loans (time and defaulted loans) should be presented in the 
balance-sheet report as a single, joint total. Procedures for 
accrual of interest on defaulted loans for a limited period of 
time (30 days) are established. This gives banks the incentive 
to write off their balance sheets long-defaulted loans and paper 
proceeds (account 943 is overloaded with such proceeds at a 
number of banks) and thus makes it possible to make bank reports 
healthier and more authentic. In this reference, it is 
absolutely obvious that commercial banks need to speed up the 
process of transition to worldwide accounting standards which 
make it possible to obtain authentic financial reports and, 
therefore, improve the quality of bank management.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Tretyakov: "Say No If You Cannot Say Yes. </F>
What Is the Head of the Kremlin Thinking About?" 
  [Text] Nursultan Nazarbayev risked asking the president of 
Russia a most difficult question for Boris Yeltsin regarding the 
creation of a Eurasian Union, which undoubtedly in language more 
understandable to all simply means the recreation of the USSR 
(naturally--no irony intended--a democratic one, with a market 
economy, and with realistic, in the sense of being realistically 
measured out, sovereignty of the member states). 
  The president of Russia became very thoughtful. 
  Boris Yeltsin never liked to and does not know how to 
respond 
to direct questions (since the autumn of 1991). If he is forced 
to do so he does it not even evasively (that is, in a Marxist 
dialectic manner, as Gorbachev did) but simultaneously giving 
two contradictory answers. With reference to the existing 
well-known decree issued by Yeltsin, for instance, presidential 
elections will take place in Russia in June 1994, whereas in 
accordance with transitional articles of Yeltsin's 
constitution--they are scheduled for June 1996. 
  Thus Yeltsin did not say yes to the president of Kazakhstan, 
(and will not do so). He did not say no (and will not do so). He 
will not say, "no, but..." either, or "yes". Sooner or later at 
some point he will say: "The Eurasian Union must be created." 
Somewhat later, at another point he will say: "By the will of 
the people who elected me I am, above all, the guarantor of the 
state sovereignty of Russia and therefore the Eurasian Union 
must not be created." 
  Let all the voters and foreign politicians scratch their 
heads in bewilderment: What could it mean? It means nothing. 
There is simply no answer. After someone starts some kind of a 
union--a Eurasian, a Soviet, or even a Euroafrican one, then we 
will think of something. It appears that scientific terms this 
is called a reactive policy. 
  Yeltsin rejected any policy based on his own initiative from 
the time when he understood that the promised sovereignty (as 
much as can be borne) was almost borne away. 
  The question concerning the Union, however, is a serious 
one. 
Nazarbayev, as undoubtedly one of the most sober-minded and 
far-sighted politicians, raised it in a thought-out manner, 
guided by many reasons four of which appear to be the most 
important ones. First of all Mr. Nazarbayev understood that in 
his lifetime he would not be able to raise Kazakhstan to a level 
of material prosperity, and especially to any stellar levels, 
without Russia (or some other superpower)--that is unrealistic. 
Secondly the imperial memory of "democratic" Russia will not 
dissipate very soon--it is best to reunite than to inevitably 
drift toward an inevitable confrontation. Third, the "Russian 
question" (especially with the inability of Russia to resolve it 
not only in the near abroad but even on its own territory) 
sooner or later will create an "explosion" in Kazakhstan within 
its current artificial borders. Fourth, China is quite near to 
it--a few more years and the Moscow suzerain will appear as a 
kindly father compared to the Beijing uncle. 
  In other words Nursultan Nazarbayev feels something that 
they 
do not even suspect in the Kremlin, or rather, they do suspect 
it but like a burnt child, dread the fire since it will be 
necessary to do some work, bear responsibility, and share power. 
Nursultan Nazarbayev realizes that in the next presidential 
elections in Russia, in Ukraine, in Belarus, and in Kazakhstan 
itself, and perhaps in a number of other republics of the former 
USSR, there will be politicians running, and in some cases 
winning, under the slogan of a peaceful recreation of the Union 
within reasonable boundaries and in reasonable forms, who simply 
cannot be classified as radicals, extremists, or even communists. 
  It is absolutely clear, and Nazarbayev knows it, that under 
Yeltsin and Kravchuk in Ukraine no Union will be 
created(Belovezhskaya Pushcha syndrome). But Nazarbayev looks 
ahead, into the future not of specific presidents, but that of 
Kazakhstan and Russia. In the latter case--beyond the Kremlin. 
In addition to that, of course, Nazarbayev has good odds--he did 
not take part in the liquidation of the USSR and the 
proclamation of a sexless CIS out of its shapeless fragments and 
Alma-Ata, naturally, does not have its West Ukraine as does 
Kiev, nor a morbid thirst for power above which there is only 
God (for atheistically raised Yeltsin, there is not even that), 
as in the case of the president of Russia. 
  It is characteristic that the talkative Moscow press greeted 
with virtually total silence a proposal by the president of a 
country which was recently accused by it of infringing on the 
rights of Russian voters in parliamentary elections in 
Kazakhstan. 
  The silence of the Moscow press, just as the silence of the 
head of the Kremlin and of practically the entire Russian 
political Olympus, constitutes the inability and fear of 
honestly and openly responding to an issue which is becoming the 
main political issue for the country (which is becoming 
increasingly more evident): What is to be done with the wounded 
"affectionate and gentle beast"--the Union, still alive and 
ensconced in the Belovezhskaya Pushcha? Is it to be nursed back 
to health? Frankly finished off, or, whilst we bashfully look 
the other way, allowed to expire while at the same time we 
attempt to enter Europe. Perhaps directly into Western Europe? 
  It is not necessary to answer that question, while limiting 
oneself to a secret strategy (for fools, which rather resembles 
a tactic) of chopping pieces off property of "fraternal 
republics" weakened more than Russia. Even the Bolsheviks did 
not conduct such a cynical policy--they were perhaps more 
aggressive, but also more honest: Whatever they could not 
swallow, whatever they could not claim on the basis of serious 
historical tradition of a state (Poland, Finland, Baltic 
states), they let go. 
  There are two questions, however, which cannot be ignored: 
Russians outside the borders of current Russia and Russian 
soldiers perishing in the pacification of warring sides on 
foreign territories. Sooner or later these questions will have 
to be faced. 
  The Kremlin remains silent. It is afraid to say yes. It is 
afraid to say no. It does not want to bring the Russians home 
(the economic indices are deteriorating) and cannot do so (it 
does not know how to achieve economic success even without 
them). But it will help support the increasingly nationalized 
organs of power of the sovereign nations, theatrically lamenting 
that there are few Russians over there and that everyone is 
compelled to speak the national language there. What language 
should the British parliament use--Japanese? Why then should the 
Ukrainian one use Russian? 
  It is too bad that the Kremlin wall was not built by the 
ancestors along administrative borders of the RSFSR. It would 
have been simpler just to sit behind it.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Tishkov, director of the Institute of </F>
Ethnology and Anthropology of the Russian Academy of Sciences: 
"The Eurasian Union As a New Symbiosis"] 
  [Text] Kazakhstan is an Eurasian country even though 
created in its current form by the Soviet regime, it has the 
required legitimacy and is going through a complicated process 
of new nation building. The patrimony of the post-Soviet 
space--the doctrine of ethnonationalism as the basis of 
statehood--was manifested strongly in that country: half of the 
population, consisting of ethnic Kazakhs, in the face of its 
elite, formulated and in many ways realized the claim to 
exclusive control of power, resources, and cultural space, 
utilizing the thesis of "their own" statehood for "indigenous" 
nations. But a multiethnic nation will be unable to function on 
the basis of that doctrine since the other citizens under 
conditions of even minimal democracy will not reconcile 
themselves to that situation, and particularly such an ethnic 
group as the Russians, which is almost as large as the Kazakh 
group. Kazakh nationalism has already manifested its impatience 
and intolerance in a provocative change of toponymy, language 
policy, in the barring of non-Kazakhs from power, prestigious 
occupations, and higher education, as well as in the immigration 
policy. To some degree the manifested nationalism was explicable 
as a form of therapy against the harm done to Kazakh people and 
the destruction of their collective dignity by former state 
regimes, as well as a means for eliminating unitary dependence 
on the former center. But it is impossible to build new 
statehood and a relationship with new fellow-citizens on the 
basis of this doctrine and political practice, just as it is 
impossible to preserve for long the contradiction in the 
sovereignty of a "multinational nation" and a "Kazakh nation." 
The time has arrived for making a choice, and that choice 
exists, and it can also become a model for many other new states 
of the former USSR. 
  President Nazarbayev was one of the first leaders to start 
speaking about his citizens in terms of a nation state--as 
Kazakhs, understanding both the real situation in the country, 
and the imperatives of world norms of state building. Kazakhstan 
can and must exist as a state representing the interests and 
rights of all of its citizens, which is on a path toward the 
creation of a multicultural civil nation. All who take part in 
the socioeconomic and cultural life of the state and are loyal 
to that state as their homeland, comprise the Kazakh nation. In 
a cultural sense the make-up of that nation has a complex 
character just as that of all other large nations of the world, 
be they the Indian, British, Spanish, or the Russian nation. 
Ethnic Kazakhs, as a nation, represent a competitive group in 
the social and cultural aspects, capable of adopting a 
nation-saving formula of "bilingualism on a multicultural basis" 
and thereby providing equality for another equally strong 
group--the Russians, while guaranteeing the preservation of 
ethnic identity for numerous minorities. That formula, without 
the reinforcing power of a special status, will grant benefits 
to Kazakhs, most of whom are bilingual and have assimilated 
numerous aspects of the Russian culture, which in turn promoted 
their modernization. That formula will end the ambiguity of the 
situation and compulsion with regard to those Kazakhs 
themselves, who utilize components of the Russian culture (in 
the linguistic aspect) and do not use the Kazakh language. What 
is most important is that it will provide promise and faith in 
their state for half of the population in the face of Russians 
and Ukrainians, relieving them of false forms of solidarity of 
the Cossack type and of the threat of becoming the objects of 
geopolitical speculations by Russian nationalism. 
  Kazakh national radicals, many of whom are establishing 
their 
status and prosperity not through diligence and ability but 
through ethnic affiliation, will not renounce their ideology 
since it brings power and allows exploitation of 
fellow-tribesmen as well as state resources as if on a "lawful" 
basis ("this is my land"), which is no better than former 
outrages. The country, however, has enough responsible and 
intelligent politicians and intellectuals who could follow a 
course toward creation of cross-ethnic social coalitions and a 
policy of cultural pluralism instead of racing around with 
ballot boxes over the territory of the former USSR collecting 
votes of citizens of other countries (but with Kazakh blood) in 
order to ensure a parliamentary majority. Ethnic nationalism is 
myopic and primitive: its adherents do not care if one or 
another force or group is deprived of the vote, it prefers "the 
solution." That is an axiom of political science. Kazakhstan 
society, which is characterized by a high level of tolerance, 
has not yet been corroded that deeply by ethnonationalism which 
still remains an exercise of the elite elements and some of the 
youth. On the Russian side, most of its recruits are probably 
veterans, but the younger elements are also now being heard. The 
faster it is possible to replace it with civil nationalism, i.e. 
all-Kazakh patriotism, the better the future faced by that 
country. 
  The latest proposal by Nazarbayev concerning creation of the 
Eurasian Union appears to be exceptionally important since the 
powerful economic and socio-cultural symbiosis between 
Kazakhstan, Russia, Kyrgyzstan and a number of other post-Soviet 
states is preserved, and it is wiser to utilize it for common 
welfare of the people without its breakup by rigid borders 
which, at least between these three states, the politicians of 
our generation will not be able to impose on the population. It 
will not harm either the sovereignty nor the culture of the 
nations and may prevent some tragic errors. It is gratifying 
that Nazarbayev's initiative received the support of many 
important politicians, for example, that of Sergey Shakhray.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Isakov, ambassador-at-large and head of </F>
the Russian Federation delegation negotiating with the 
Lithuanian Republic: "We Do Not Intend To Forgo Russia's 
Interests, but We Are Ready To Go Halfway in Negotiations With 
Lithuania"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Carte Blanche </H5>
  The Russian-Lithuanian negotiations have been going on for 
more than a year, and they have their own complex history. A key 
event was the withdrawal by 31 August 1993 of Russian troops 
from Lithuanian territory, which finally eliminated the main 
irritant in the relations between the Russian Federation and the 
Lithuanian Republic. A new stage ensued. However, the 
negotiating process did not get any easier. 
  Shortly after, a number of important agreements were signed 
during the visit of the head of the Russian Government to 
Vilnius on 18 November 1993. This event became the practical 
implementation of the agreement achieved in the course of the 
meeting of the presidents of Russia and Lithuania in Moscow on 4 
November 1993. 
  The emphasis in the work of the Russian delegation shifted 
to 
the preparation of agreements to ensure the normal vital 
activity of Kaliningrad Oblast and the problems associated with 
this. But the Lithuanian side was in no hurry to activate the 
dialogue at the level of official delegations. As a result, 
despite our repeated appeals and proposals, the Lithuanian 
partners, beginning with November of last year, stubbornly 
remained silent. A long break occurred in the work of the 
delegations, the end to which did not occur until 21-22 March of 
this year, when our delegations met in Moscow. It is already 
apparent from this how unconvincing the statements of the 
Lithuanian representatives sound about readiness for 
negotiations on any subject and the need to intensify the 
process of the Russian-Lithuanian negotiations. On our part, we 
always were for energetic work on problems on the widest 
possible front. It is sufficient to refer to the fact that we 
have already submitted two dozen drafts of various kinds of 
agreements. 
  On the whole, the March round of negotiations, in our 
assessment, proceeded in a sufficiently businesslike way. The 
Lithuanian delegation arrived in Moscow with a new membership. 
While in the past, a majority of its members consisted of 
representatives of the political opposition that had an interest 
in discussions of a general nature, now they have been replaced 
by specialists and practical workers. Despite the differences 
that remained between us as before in approaches to individual 
problems, this made it possible to work on specific questions 
for a great part of the time. A draft of an agreement was 
initialed on entry points on the Russian-Lithuanian border. In 
the end, a list of 12 draft agreements was coordinated that will 
be worked on in priority order by our delegations and 
corresponding working groups. On this list are drafts of 
agreements on cooperation in the sphere of nuclear energy, 
pension guarantees, principles of work activity of citizens of 
the Russian Federation in Lithuania and Lithuanians in Russia, 
and others. An agreement was reached on conducting a meeting in 
April in Vilnius of experts of both sides on questions of 
civilian motor vehicle and railroad transit, including 
additional work on a draft temporary agreement on mutual travel 
of citizens, and afterwards on a meeting of experts of the 
customs services of Russia and Lithuania this month in Moscow. 
We would like to count on a positive outcome of these 
negotiations, keeping in mind that at the end of April and the 
beginning of May our delegations could conclude work on yet 
another group of drafts that regulate questions of civilian 
traffic to and from Kaliningrad Oblast. But if this is not done, 
then the position will prevail that results in the 
dissatisfaction of both sides. There still remain for us 
inconveniences and difficulties of visas, customs, and other 
areas in the sphere of transit, especially motor vehicle, 
through Lithuanian territory. But the Lithuanian side, in its 
turn, cites our failure to put into effect an agreement signed 
on trade and economic relations. At the same time, it seems to 
have practically forgotten the provisions of the 
Russian-Lithuanian declaration of 30 August 1993, and also the 
package of agreements at a working meeting of the Russian and 
Lithuanian presidents in Moscow on 4 November of the same year. 
After all, at that time there was talk not only about the need 
to come to an agreement in the sphere of transport and about 
Russian military pensioners, but also about accelerating work to 
conclude agreements about guaranteeing the normal vital activity 
of Kaliningrad Oblast. But, after all, it is precisely the 
latter that do not exist to this day. Russia still has not been 
answered on these questions with reciprocity. Therefore, under 
the situation that has developed, it would be pointless to count 
on the immediate enactment of an agreement on trade and economic 
relations in which Lithuania would receive most favorable 
treatment in trade with Russia 
  It is especially necessary to talk about Russian military 
transit to Kaliningrad Oblast and from it through Lithuanian 
territory. For the time being, it exists on the basis of our 
verbal agreements. The Lithuanian side also proceeds on the 
basis of provisions of the agreement on the transit of troops 
and military freight of the Russian Federation being pulled out 
of the FRG(!) On the one hand, Lithuania seems not to deny the 
reasonableness of the endeavors of Russia to maintain 
unobstructed communications with part of its own territory, 
which Kaliningrad Oblast is. On the other hand, the Lithuanian 
side does not conceal its desire to come to an agreement about 
the organization of Russian military transportation exactly on 
the basis of a bilateral agreement (we have already turned over 
our draft of such an agreement). Judging by everything, the 
matter is moving now to the adoption by the Lithuanian 
authorities of some kind of unilateral decisions that establish 
the rules for the shipment of military and dangerous freight of 
any foreign states over the territory of the Lithuanian 
Republic. But about what kinds of more or less significant 
foreign military shipments, other than Russian, can there be a 
realistic discussion? An attempt is also being made now to 
neutralize the need for a bilateral agreement on this question 
in Lithuania with the help of the expression of "concern" 
regarding the alleged excessive presence of military troops in 
Kaliningrad Oblast--a kind of threat to the security of 
Lithuania. In addition, it is true, at least official Vilnius 
admits that it does not sense "any kinds of aggressive efforts 
of Russia, and any kind of real threat on its part." From our 
standpoint, even given the presence of some kinds of general 
rules, our countries, nevertheless, should establish in a treaty 
procedure the conditions for Russian servicemen and freight to 
transit through Lithuanian territory. 
  We are also conducting negotiations on the delimitation of 
borders between the Russian Federation and the Lithuanian 
Republic. Although statements have been made repeatedly in 
Vilnius about Lithuania's lack of any kind of territorial claims 
on Russia, the position of the Lithuanian side on the 
demarcation of the territorial sea, which, from our standpoint, 
contradicts the UN convention of 1982 on maritime law, is 
beginning to create certain difficulties in the negotiations. 
  Finally, I would like to touch on one more subject that is 
continuously present in Russian-Lithuanian negotiations. These 
are problems that directly affect the life of ethnic Russians in 
the Lithuanian Republic (the Lithuanian delegation, on its part, 
comes out with various kinds of claims against us). In 
Lithuania, as is known, it was possible to avoid serious 
complications on national questions and on questions of 
citizenship. However, this does not entirely mean that there are 
no difficulties at all in this sphere. They simply have another 
character than, for example, in Latvia and Estonia. It must be 
noted that the Lithuanian side, despite our proposals, has 
already been refusing over the course of a long time to examine 
the draft of an agreement on cooperation for the purposes of 
ensuring the rights of ethnic, linguistic, cultural, and 
religious minorities. At the same time, references are made to 
pertinent legislative acts in effect in Lithuania that meet 
generally acceptable international norms. From our standpoint, 
the presence of any kind of national decrees does not at all 
rule out the possibility of a bilateral agreement between the 
Russian Federation and the Lithuanian Republic. Moreover, if our 
approaches to guaranteeing the rights of minorities are really 
close or coincide, this fact would only facilitate the 
achievement of an agreement on this score. 
  In conclusion, I would like to note that on the whole we 
look 
with optimism to the prospects of Russian-Lithuanian 
negotiations. I am convinced that, despite all of the 
difficulties and problems, our countries have real opportunities 
for the development of mutually beneficial good neighbor 
relations. Without forgoing Russia's interests, our delegation 
is ready to go halfway to meet the necessary agreements for 
expanding and strengthening the treaty and legal bases of 
Russian-Lithuanian relations.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Skachko: "Ivan Plyushch: 'He Who Has </F>
the Power Has the Key to Paradise'--Elections Continue"] 
  [Text] By decision of district electoral commissions, 
repeat elections of Ukrainian people's deputies were held in 33 
districts of eight oblasts in Ukraine. According to Central 
Electoral Commission [CEC] data, on 3 April elections took place 
in 30 districts, with a high voter turnout. CEC Chairman Ivan 
Yemets, in particular, reported that 81 percent of voters cast 
their ballots in Gusyatinskiy District in Ternopol Oblast; 78 
percent--in Izoslavskiy District in Khmelnitsk Oblast; and so 
on. According to preliminary data, elected on 3 April were: 
scientist Vasiliy Kostitskiy, a national-democrat close to Rukh, 
in Ivano-Frankovsk Oblast; the leader of Ukrainian socialists, 
Aleksandr Moroz (Kiev Oblast); and Vladimir Bortnik, a 
representative of the so-called "party of power" and head of the 
Ukragrotekhservis concern. 
  Repeat elections confirmed the current disposition of 
political forces in Ukraine and voters' preferences for some or 
other political forces. The second round also confirmed the 
personal confrontation between the leaders of two branches of 
power--parliament Speaker Ivan Plyushch and President Leonid 
Kravchuk--which has been increasingly gaining momentum lately. 
The latter and his team justly saw in the fact of parliamentary 
elections and the election of a new Supreme Council a threat to 
the very existence of strong, practically unlimited presidential 
power in Ukraine. As is known, the first thing the new 
parliament is expected to do, in the words of current Speaker 
Ivan Plyushch, is adopt a law on the president of Ukraine's new 
powers. It is envisaged that he will be only a head of state 
with purely representative functions, and therefore moving 
presidential elections from 26 June of this year to a later 
date--which Leonid Kravchuk and his entourage insist on--is out 
of the question. 
  Some political forces--both old and new--also speak for a 
variety of reasons against strong presidential authority. In 
particular, the communists and socialists declared through their 
leaders that they see abolishing the institution of the 
presidency in Ukraine as the final goal of their parliamentary 
activities. Their reckoning is simple: Behind the backs of the 
resurrected soviets one can also restore a firm vertical line of 
party-communist omnipotence. Many regional economic managers, 
too, would like to see a weaker presidential authority, 
justifiably seeing in it the strengthening of the functions of 
the Kiev center taking the place of the Moscow one. The only 
forces that unconditionally support strong presidential 
authority are those that associate with it the conduct of a 
reformist course. The presidential team apparently took this 
circumstance into consideration only lately, and for this reason 
made several steps in the direction of privatization. In 
particular, on 1 April the parliament's newspaper GOLOS UKRAINY 
published a list of 150 enterprises whose stock Ukrainian 
citizens can buy with their privatization certificates, as well 
as procedures for conducting this operation and samples of the 
documentation needed. The publication of these documents looks 
more like an April's Fool joke than real help in privatization 
or its actual implementation, since Ukraine still lacks a 
network of investment funds, brokerage offices, and other 
institutions servicing the process of denationalization; the 
road of the privatization certificate to the object of 
privatization, on the other hand, is difficult and convoluted 
because of various paperwork formalities. 
  Parliament Speaker Ivan Plyushch permitted himself a sharp 
personal attack against Leonid Kravchuk at an election precinct 
during the voting on 27 March, and is still in a fighting mood. 
Over the past week the mass media showed several times a 
recorded interview in which Ivan Plyushch urged Ukrainian 
citizens to participate in the second round of elections. He 
also urged the citizens to decide were they stand politically 
without squandering more money on the conduct of repeat 
elections. And on 3 April on Ukrainian television Plyushch said: 
"You have to show up and vote--this is best in every respect. We 
have neither the money for repeat elections, nor the need, nor 
the time to hold them. I appeal to all people of Ukraine; I 
plead; I bow deep to them: Come, cast a repeat vote, elect 
deputies. Whom you elect is your business. I want to say once 
again: He who has the power has the key to paradise. Now the 
people have the power. Whom you will pass this power to will be 
determined in the repeat elections."

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Vasylchenko, chief engineer and </F>
director general of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, by DER 
SPIEGEL; place and date not given: "I Am Not Afraid"] 
  [Text] 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Eight years after the Chernobyl catastrophe, 
two of the four reactors are still in operation. When will you 
switch the nuclear power plant off? 
  [Vasylchenko] I think that the excitement is not justified. 
Chernobyl is working more reliably than all other nuclear power 
plants in Ukraine. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] However, the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) attests to numerous safety faults... 
  [Vasylchenko] ...only in a press statement that was not, as 
promised, conveyed to us in advance. However, apart from the 
known problems, the IAEA inspection team that visited us in 
March did not ascertain any new faults in the basic design of 
this reactor in its report. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The inspectors are warning against difficult 
working conditions. 
  [Vasylchenko] What is meant by that? I do not know any. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Last year alone, 150 specialists left the 
plant, many went to Russia. Your predecessor, a Russian, 
abandoned his post under mysterious circumstances and 
disappeared into a sanatorium. 
  [Vasylchenko] We replaced the persons who had left by 
no-less qualified employees. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Many experts doubt this. You depend on 
Russia's spare part deliveries. 
  [Vasylchenko] This is no problem for the power plant. The 
Russian enterprises would supply everything if only the money 
were available for it. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You do not have it. 
  [Vasylchenko] The safety standard is not lower than in other 
reactors of the same type in Russia and it is even higher in 
several respects. In no other reactor has so comprehensive work 
been done to increase safety. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Nevertheless, compared to other nuclear 
reactor types, Chernobyl continues to be extremely dangerous. 
  [Vasylchenko] The United States and Germany can afford 
higher safety standards, while Ukraine can only afford a lower 
one. This was also laid down in the IAEA documents. If it were 
switched off, my people would become even poorer. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The fear of a new catastrophe is unfounded? 
  [Vasylchenko] Those who are alarmed only show that they are 
not familiar enough with the matter. I worked in Chernobyl 
before the accident, I have worked there after it from the first 
day onward, and I am not afraid. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] This sounds very cynical; 2,500 of the workers 
who were employed there after the melting of the core died; more 
than 50,000 people have fallen ill. Now IAEA inspectors are 
fearing a new catastrophe because the sarcophagus has cracks and 
is in danger of collapsing. 
  [Vasylchenko] According to my assessment, the sarcophagus is 
no less stable than at the time of its construction. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Chernobyl covers only 7 percent of the 
national power demand. Could Ukraine not do without Chernobyl 
by savings, for example, the installation of counters in 
apartments and a slight electricity price increase, which is 
very cheap? 
  [Vasylchenko] If one talks of closing down Chernobyl, one 
has to talk about closing down all RBMK reactors in Russia and 
Lithuania. I myself would be very glad if further reactor 
blocks were built in my city. They would probably be even safer.

<F P=106> [Interview with President of the Republic of Crimea Yuriy </F>
Meshkov by Andrey Uglanov; place and date not given: "Where the 
`Crimean Island' Is Floating. Yu. Meshkov: `Easy, Gentlemen, 
Easy!'"] 
  [Text] "If you happen to have been born in the 
Empire, it is best to live in a remote province on the sea." 
These lines from the poem by I. Brodskiy can no longer (or for 
now) apply to the residents of the Crimea. The former recreation 
zone of the great empire has been transformed into a disputed 
zone and, unexpectedly, with no prior indication, has acquired 
its own constitution, parliament, and president. People are not 
being shot here; things have become even quieter. But what will 
happen tomorrow depends on too many factors and above all 
whether Ukraine and Russia will continue to move further and 
further away from one another. 
  Today we are speaking with the president of the 
Republic of Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov. He was born in 1945. His 
father is a Don Cossack, his mother--a Ukrainian, and his 
wife--a Russian. He has a daughter 23 and a son 13. He served in 
the border guards, graduated from the law department of Moscow 
State University, and has worked as a sailor, an investigator, 
and a lawyer. 
  [Uglanov] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, in Kiev they call you a 
separatist. Does that offend you? 
  [Meshkov] The only people in Kiev who call me a separatist 
are representatives of the Ukrainian Nationalist Party. (Their 
influence is rated at 0.3 percent.) The rest of the residents 
support our goals--solving crucial economic problems. If the 
Ukrainian government were also interested in improving the life 
of the people, it would never have proceeded toward isolation 
from Russia. From an economic standpoint that was suicide. But 
the government came to power relying on nationalistic 
structures, and now the sad result of the ill-considered 
economic policy of the Ukrainian leaders is so apparent that one 
might say that the question of its fate has already been decided. 
  Unfortunately the government of Ukraine is still not 
accepting the changes in the consciousness of the people of 
Ukraine. Especially in the left-bank, eastern part of the 
country where nationalism has always been something alien to the 
people. 
  [Uglanov] Your sharp statements are evoking a fairly painful 
reaction from Kiev. Are you not afraid that they will arrest you? 
  [Meshkov] Since the time when I was serving on the border I 
have stopped fearing anything in this world except for the loss 
of my loved ones. Everything else is unessential when there is a 
grand purpose for which it is worthwhile to do something 
personal. This is not the ranting of a fanatic. This is about 
our republic's freedom. 
  [Uglanov] Can you imagine the Crimea as a zone of military 
operations? 
  [Meshkov] No. There are no forces inside the Crimea capable 
of provoking a conflict and there are no preconditions for one. 
And we have an aversion to anything that detracts from solving 
crucial problems. And in general Crimeans are preparing for the 
beginning of the vacation season. 
  [Uglanov] Not everything depends on you alone. What 
political 
changes, in your view, must take place in Kiev in order for the 
Crimea not to become a "hot spot"? 
  [Meshkov] Reasonable people must come to power. But now the 
people in power are accomplished politicians, virtuosos. While 
professing one ideology, they rely on forces which they 
previously destroyed, although they helped them to get in power. 
There has probably never been more of this in world history. You 
cannot deny that these politicians have intelligence, 
trickiness, and treachery. 
  Today we must have people in power who reflect the objective 
interests of the citizens and the economy of Ukraine. We will 
have no problems with them. It is clear that both before and 
after 1954 the people of the Crimea remained a part of the 
people of Russia. You can write whatever you want to on the map 
of the Crimea and depict it with any symbols, and you can even 
stamp it with a trident--but that will change nothing in our 
consciousness! 
  [Uglanov] How do you envision the future of Ukraine? 
  [Meshkov] Reasonable people have one path. Either all of 
Ukraine will follow the path of the Crimea or they will be 
doomed to even greater troubles than they have now. As they say 
here, they are "sick of everything"--the orgy of nationalism and 
the waving of flags and tridents. This is no longer accepted. 
  [Uglanov] Whom would you like to see in the post of 
president 
of Ukraine; whom would it be easiest for you to talk to? 
  [Meshkov] In general I find it easiest to speak with the 
leaders of Russia. 
  [Uglanov] As president of the Crimea are you counting on 
support from the Black Sea Fleet in the event of a critical 
situation? 
  [Meshkov] I such situations an immense number of people 
gather in front of your building. And this is taken into account 
in Kiev. 
  [Uglanov] You just reacted very sharply to the appointment 
from Kiev of a Crimean deputy. But in all Russian oblasts there 
are representatives of the president of the Russian Federation, 
and nothing is said. 
  [Meshkov] In the oblasts, but not in the republics. 
Tatarstan, for example, has its own president and an agreement 
has been concluded with Russia for division of authority. But 
what is happening here? When there is a nationally elected 
president, suddenly there appears an individual authorized to 
oversee his actions and "represent the Republic of Crimea at the 
international level"(!) That is going too far. 
  [Uglanov] I see that you have portraits hanging in your 
office... 
  [Meshkov] Yes, that is Peter the First and Count Vorontsov. 
  [Uglanov] Well, that is probably enough about politics. As 
the chief of the executive power, answer a good old question: 
How is the planting going? Or is there no time for it what with 
all the rallies? 
  [Meshkov] I must answer joyfully. The planting has been more 
than successful. There was a difficult situation with fuel, 
equipment, and seeds. They rushed around the fields trying to 
solve these problems. Now I am calm: The problem of the harvest 
was solved in the stage of planting. 
  [Uglanov] But there is a fuel shortage in Ukraine. 
  [Meshkov] This is true. But we have no problems with fuel, 
and its price has dropped by almost half. Measures of an 
economic nature have been taken. So people may come to the 
Crimea with their own vehicles--there will be no problem 
refueling. If, of course, they manage to get across Ukraine. 
  [Uglanov] And what about food products? 
  [Meshkov] Help yourself--we have it all: to drink and to 
eat. 
Incidentally, we are negotiating with the Russian Ministry of 
Railways to reduce summer fares and railroad tickets. So if you 
buy a ticket and put down enough rubles to meet Russian 
standards, your capital will increase 20-fold here and your 
level of vacation will be tops. Unfortunately, there might be 
only one peaceful place for Russians to rest--the Crimea. 
Normal, Russian, homey. With doors open wide, the Crimeans 
receive vacationers with any kind of purses. 
  [Uglanov] Is Foros also open to guests? 
  [Meshkov] M.S. Gorbachev's dacha is being protected (for no 
good reason) by L. Kravchuk's personal guard. We will do 
everything we can to open up this historic place. 
  [Uglanov] They say you are experiencing friction with Prime 
Minister Ye. Saburov. 
  [Meshkov] Yes, everything is normal. That is one of the 
tasks 
of the special services--to create an uneasy situation. At 
certain stages they are successful. But on the whole we are 
working together.

the Law of Ukraine "The Privatization of the Property of State 
Enterprises," and is directed toward the widespread development 
of the privatization of the property of state enterprises. 
<H5>  Part 1. Conditions for the Conduct of Privatization </H5>
<H5>  Section 1. Priorities of Privatization </H5>
  Based on the results of the privatization process in 
1992-93, 
the following priorities have been defined for the realization 
of state policy in the sphere of privatization: 
  --the widespread pursuit of privatization of subjects in 
groups A and E; 
  --the launch of privatization for subjects in groups B, C 
and 
D; 
  --the assurance of the participation of citizens of Ukraine 
in privatization through their use of privatization deposit 
accounts; 
  --the development of the market infrastructure; 
  --the creation of conditions for making the privatization 
process and the post-privatization functioning of the 
enterprises more energetic; 
  --the creation of conditions for the participation of 
foreign 
investors in privatization; 
  --the coordination of the processes of privatization of 
property that is under nationwide, republic (Republic of Crimea) 
and municipal ownership, and the conduct of organizational and 
financial measures with that aim. 
  The tasks of the Program are mandatory for fulfillment by 
central and local bodies of state executive authority and bodies 
of regional and local self-government. 
<H5>  Section 2. The Subjects of Privatization </H5>
  2.1. The subjects of privatization are categorized by groups 
based on the initial (balance-sheet) value of the fixed capital 
as indicated in the balance-sheet account for the quarter that 
preceded the date of the decision by the privatization body on 
the privatization of that subject (hereinafter, the value) and 
qualitative features. The subjects are categorized as follows: 
  Group A--subjects whose value does not exceed 700 million 
karbovantsi in prices for 1 August 1993 (aside from the 
enterprises of group D); 
  Group B--subjects whose value was from 700 million to 45 
billion karbovantsi in prices for 1 August 1993, and the portion 
of the value of the capital per worker does not exceed the 
nominal value of a privatization property certificate by more 
than 1.5 times (aside from the enterprises of group D); 
  Group C--subjects whose value was from 700 million to 45 
billion karbovantsi in prices for 1 August 1993, and the portion 
of value of the capital per worker exceeds the nominal value of 
a privatization property certificate by more than 1.5 times 
(aside from the enterprises of group D); 
  Group D--monopoly enterprises that are designated as such 
under established procedure regardless of their value; 
enterprises in the military-industrial complex that are subject 
to conversion in accordance with the corresponding program 
regardless of their value; enterprises whose privatization is 
being carried out with the enlistment of foreign investments 
under international treaties of Ukraine, regardless of their 
value; enterprises whose value exceeds 45 billion karbovantsi; 
  Group E--mothballed subjects and subjects of incomplete 
construction; the property of liquidated enterprises; 
  Group F--portions (shares, shares of stock) that belong to 
the state of the property of enterprises that are under mixed 
forms of ownership. 
  In case of the indexing of the balance-sheet value of the 
fixed capital, the amount of the value by which the 
categorization of the subjects of privatization is accomplished 
is increased by the indexing factor of the privatization 
property certificates. 
  2.2. Subjects that have the greatest impact on the 
development of the consumer market, as well as those whose 
presence under state ownership is restraining the process of 
financial stabilization and slowing economic development and the 
formation of a market economy, are subject to priority 
privatization. These subjects include: 
  --enterprises in retail trade, public catering and domestic 
services; 
  --operations enterprises in housing and municipal services, 
including enterprises of the housing and hotel industries, and

  --mothballed subjects; 
  --subjects of incomplete construction that were financed out 
of state capital investments and subsidies from state or local

already expired. 
  The decision to privatize those subjects is made by the 
privatization bodies at their own initiative.

structural subdivisions from their composition is not permitted 
if that could lead to the disruption of production and 
technological processes.

computation of the appropriate value of subjects being

Opening of Privatization Deposit Accounts and the Making of 
Payments From Them approved by the National Bank of Ukraine and 
the State Specialized Commercial Savings Bank of Ukraine, as 
well as the Statute on the Procedure for Transactions for 
Acquired Facilities of Privatization approved by the National 
Bank and the State Property Fund of Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmytro Shkarban, candidate of economic sciences, </F>
docent, Ukrainian Agrarian University: "Ukrainian Statehood Can 
be Saved by 27,700 Private Farms; In U.S. Highly Profitable 
Farms Account for Only 13.9 Percent of the Total, Feed the 
Nation and Provide $40 Billion Dollars Worth of Exports"] 
  [Text] As painful as it is to admit, Ukraine is at the 
brink of losing its economic independence. The treasury is faced 
with deficits, the investment policy is not working, industrial 
bankruptcies are on the increase, and the process of economic 
recovery has been aborted. This state of affairs is partially 
explained by absence of economic reforms, political instability, 
and breakdown of commercial relations with the former Soviet 
republics. In my view, however, the primary fault lies with 
improper developmental and financial priorities. For example, in 
1989 87 percent of Ukrainian farms made a profit of 30 percent 
or better; in 1992 only a fourth of them did. 
  On the surface the problems appear insurmountable, but are 
they really? The March 1993 currency emission of 1.2 billion 
karbovantsi gave a 803 billion karbovantsi credit to the 
agricultural sector. Unfortunately, the credit was squandered 
across the board rather than directed at the remaining 
productive collective, state and private farms that can still 
show a profit. 
  Although the number of private farms in Ukraine has already 
exceeded 25,000, the average size is only 15 hectares and most 
are about two hectares. Obviously, such farms have a limited 
profit potential and cannot make a serious contribution to the 
national economy. 
  In his time Stolypin saw Ukrainian future as a land of 100 
hectare farms. In the U.S. an average farm has 187 arable 
hectares and in Germany 77. What can Ukraine accomplish with an 
average of 15 hectares? 
  The fact that only a small percentage of the farms is 
profitable need not be discouraging. This is the case in most 
countries. In the U.S., for example, 52.4 percent of the farms 
are weekend farms or farms that barely make a profit or operate 
at a loss. The average income from such farms stands at $930 a 
year. The real income is generated by the 13.9 percent highly 
profitable farms that feed the nation and provide industry with 
raw materials. In addition, the U.S. treasury makes more than 
forty billion dollars a year from agricultural exports. 
  The following facts can be used to assess efficiency of our 
farms. For example, in the Brusyliv Rayon of Zhytomyr Oblast 
Volodymyr Stadchenko runs a very efficient farm consisting of 60 
hectares of arable land. To feed the entire rayon, only two such 
farms would be needed. The entire oblast could be fed by some 50 
farms, and all of Ukraine by 1250. If we could but concentrate 
our attention on some 5000 farms and provide them with full 
financial support, young stock, high quality seeds, and the 
latest in agrotechnology and education we could get rid of many 
of our problems. I have the impression that the present minister 
of agriculture is heading in this direction. 
  Concomitantly, Ukraine must restructure its credit-granting 
and financial systems so as to enhance productivity and 
production. Consider average wages: in Ukraine it comes to $7 a 
month and in Germany $21.3 an hour. The hourly wages in France 
are $15.2, in Italy $16.2, and then follow Portugal --$3.5, 
South Korea -- $4.1, Singapore -- $3.7, Hong Kong -- $3.2, and 
Poland -- $2.7. Prices of sugar, meat, butter, gas, gasoline, 
electricity, housing and services have approached -- and in some 
cases exceeded -- world prices, while our government has not 
seen fit to increase wages. Frankly, the people feel that they 
are merely the chattel of a bureaucratic-mafia cabal rather than 
builders of an independent and sovereign Ukraine. 
  The majority of laws passed in Ukraine are unenforced and 
exist only on paper. Issuance of housing, industrial and real 
estate "Privatization Certificates" has been scheduled but not 
implemented. What value will they have if they cannot be 
purchased, sold, or transferred as a gift or inheritance? What 
we need are certificates that have commercial value and can be 
freely traded and exchanged to create funds in lieu of money. 
Since they will be unsuitable for commercial transactions they 
will be unlikely to affect productivity. 
  Ukraine needs a national currency, but its introduction is 
beset with difficulties. Our economic problems, lack of gold 
reserves, shortage of industrial goods, and of a stabilizing 
fund in the amount of two billion dollars demands a novel 
approach since we cannot wait until these roadblocks are 
overcome. Further, I believe a national currency has to be 
introduced in a stepwise manner to maintain its value. 
  Initially the hryvnya should be limited to certain sectors 
of 
the economy such as agriculture, gas and oil industry and 
railways. The hryvnya should have been introduced at the time of 
the 1993 harvest for gas and oil purchases, while the railway 
industry should have been included because of its massive size 
and stability. Thus, for a time two currencies would coexist: a 
convertible hryvnya and free-floating kupon, with the hryvnya 
establishing its own sphere of influence and stability. In 1993 
the need for hryvnya was acute since we had to buy gasoline, 
salt, oil, mineral fertilizers, etc. for world prices while the 
price for hard wheat was set at 362-600,000 karbovantsi a tonne 
-- or $60 at the old exchange rate -- while the world price was 
$240. 
  How can we expect our farmers to sell their products to the 
state at a quarter of the world price? And if they don't, will 
we have to buy these products abroad? The first order of 
business should be to instill in the farmers a sense of 
confidence in Ukraine and the introduction of the hryvnya is a 
step in the right direction. 
  Successful introduction of the hryvnya will also depend on 
creating the right conditions for its support. One priority is 
to reduce the size of the military establishment -- over a 
million men in the army, navy, national guard, border guards, 
security service and other formations -- which in proportion to 
the general workforce exceeds that of any other country. Ukraine 
has 2800 military airplanes while England has 1500, Germany 
1350, Italy 840 and France 1550. Then there are thousands of 
modern tanks, strategic missiles... What country has the economy 
to support all this? A rational review of the military doctrine 
should save us 500-700 million dollars. 
  A second priority is exporting grain, which in 1993 could 
have earned us 450-500 million dollars. 
  A third priority would be to utilize the productive might of 
the military-industrial complex in which a karbovanets-kupon 
equals a dollar or, in some cases, five dollars. The income 
derived from such sources could be on the order of two to three 
billion dollars. 
  A fourth priority is the creation of a tax base to support 
the hryvnya. All industrial sectors have to be taxed without 
exception. For example, the metallurgical complex in Kryvyy Rih 
has been working at 100 percent capacity since April 1993 and 
its production has been on the increase as a result of the 
industry getting tax relief. But 70 percent of the metal goes to 
Russia and the profits are lodged in their banks, while the rest 
of the Ukrainian industry lacks for metals and the Ukrainian 
treasury doesn't get a penny from such "close relation." For 
whose benefit does Kryvyy Rih complex pollute the environment 
and deplete Ukraine's natural resources? 
  The fifth and last priority in setting our economy aright 
has 
to deal with rational use of our energy resources and raw 
materials. No one yet has reimbursed the state for oil imported 
in 1992. The oil just disappeared into various mafia-controlled 
networks. What happened to the oil of the Black Sea fleet? Was 
it paid for by the dismissal of the Ukrainian naval commander 
Borys Korzhyn? 
  Finally, the economy will only improve if every aspect of 
society and production -- land, capital, work, science, 
technology, intellect, environment -- is recognized as having 
monetary value. 
  Unless land is sold, work valuated, and the ecologic costs 
of 
oil pipelines and terminals computed, it will be impossible to 
create a Ukrainian market economy.

"Russian GAZPROM Shackling Terms for Ukraine: Landyk Team 
Transfers Pipeline Control to Russia and Undermines Ukrainian 
Independence"] 
  [Text] A year ago the president of Armenia, Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan, paid for Turkmen natural gas with diamonds air 
delivered to Ashkhabad, and not with Russian rubles or other 
freely-convertible currency. Ukraine is as dependent as some 
other CIS countries on Moscow for energy. However, unlike 
Armenia, our payments were not in diamonds or gold, but in 
sugar, meat, our fleet, nuclear weapons and, now, by renting out 
our territory. On top of that, our former premiers and 
vice-premiers responsible for this state of affairs pose as 
Ukraine's saviors. For example, Fokin claimed to have secured a 
direct source of gasoline after visiting the Tyumen oil fields, 
a promise that turned out to be as ephemeral as Fokin himself. 
Yuliy Yoffe also disappeared after promising rivers of Iranian 
oil, and is now working in the USA. Leonid Kuchma did not let a 
day pass by without talking about Russian altruism. What that 
meant was that Chernomyrdin gave Ukraine a drop of gasoline as a 
birthday present for Kuchma! After the drop, agriculture and 
transportation came to a standstill and power stations were 
starving for fuel. Water transport suffered and the economic 
solutions advocated by Kuchma brought Ukraine into subservience 
to its northern neighbor. 
  Now the Russian energy monopolists have developed an 
unquenchable appetite for Ukrainian pipelines, and ordered a 
so-called Ukrainian government delegation to Moscow. `Ukrainian' 
in name only since Vice-Premier Landyk, who headed the 
delegation, recognizes only Russian as the official state 
language. The personages accompanying him, and who were also 
disinterested in Ukrainian national interests, were as follows: 
  Mykhaylo Kovalko, Director, Derzhkamnafthaz; 
  Valentyn Kolomiyev, Director General, UKRHAZPROM; Volodymyr 
Novytskyy, First Deputy-Minister of Industry; 
  Anatoliy Volkovskyy, First Deputy-Head of Derzhpromresursy; 
and 
  Viktor Hladush, Deputy Minister of External Economic 
Relations; as well as an entire cohort of lower-ranking 
ministerial minions. 
  The Russian side, represented by Rem Vyakhirev's 
stock-company GAZPROM, immediately went on the attack! They 
demanded that Ukraine pay its energy debts within a month or 
fuel deliveries would stop. True, they made a concession and 
allowed last year's debt to be paid in cash and industrial 
goods. But this year's debt, they insisted out of sheer 
friendship, has to be paid in either Russian rubles or American 
dollars. Furthermore, beginning with April 1st deliveries will 
depend on prepayments and the Ukrainian industry was accused of 
`stealing' Russian gas from the pipelines. 
  The first attack was immediately followed by another: 
Vyakhirev demanded that Ukraine immediately turn over its 
pipelines, refineries and other fuel supply facilities in 
Western Ukraine, as well as port facilities in Odessa and 
Illichiv to GAZPROM and that Russians have exclusive control. 
Those are conditions for "taking pity" and agreeing not only to 
resume gas deliveries in full but also to make up for 80 percent 
of the lost Turkmen deliveries. Even Rem Vyakhirev gloated 
before Moscow journalists that "This agreement is not to 
Ukraine's advantage!" 
  The Landyk team was shown to be completely ineffective; the 
only remaining unresolved issue is who is to have the final 
control over the Ukrainian fuel supply network. However, one 
doesn't have to be a politician to realize that our northern 
neighbor, pretending to make concessions, continues to press his 
own interests. 
  Ukraine and the other `near abroad' countries are of vital 
importance to the Russian gas interests. It is through Ukrainian 
territory that Russia exports 90 percent of its gas to Western 
Europe at a considerable profit. Russia cannot enter the 
European market without Ukraine, although plans are being made 
to go through Belarus and Poland. But that will cost a lot and 
GAZPROM doesn't have the resources. Even so deliveries to 
Bulgaria and Turkey will have to go through Ukrainian pipelines. 
  Can you image the hue and cry in Moscow if the Khokhols 
[derogatory Russian term for Ukrainians] suddenly emulated the 
so-called older brother's power play by demanding remuneration 
for transit rights in hard currency? This is not something that 
I advocate, but in an extreme situation it might become 
necessary if we are forced to it. What prevented the Ukrainian 
emissaries from responding in kind to this type of one-sided 
pressure? Surely we have the right to look after our own 
interests. Unfortunately, Landyk gave in and agreed to joint 
oversight over Ukrainian pipelines, and wherever you have two 
bosses you are going to have problems. 
  At present we have neither the dollars nor the rubles to pay 
Russia for energy. But that does not mean that we have to sell 
our territorial rights. Our debts could be covered by a rational 
economic reforms but for the failure of our present and past 
governments to act in a responsible manner. 
  The second round of negotiations will take place in Moscow 
on 
April 10. Russia won't back off and will continue to demand a 
controlling block of shares. Belarus is already on her knees for 
the 21 billion cubic meters of gas that GAZPROM promised to 
provide for a 51 percent share in the BILORUSTRANSHAZ concern. 
Ukraine needs almost five times as much gas, and this need is 
playing into Russia's hands. 
  How do our specialists feel about Landyk's position? 
  Taday Mykhalevych, chairman of the Joint Dispatching 
Administration of UKRHAZPROM, has stated that "We cannot give 
Russia Ukrainian pipelines on the basis of a forced, one-sided 
agreement... Suppose we pay our present debts this way. Then 
what of the future? Will we sell our remaining gas pipelines?" 
  Our officials should listen to Mr. Mykhalevych, who has 
risen 
through the ranks in UKRHAZPROM from an operator to chairman of 
one of its main administrations. Mykhalevych suggests that 
Russia cover some of the construction costs of the 
Urengoy-Pomari-Uzhhorod pipeline. We could also help Russia 
develop some of its resources in its northern regions, but all 
of this would have to be on the basis of fair financial 
arrangements. Today such financial arrangements cover the cost 
of only 23 percent of the gas we need, and the rest has to be 
financed from other sources. Last year we used over 100 billion 
cubic meters of gas, a figure suggesting that there is 
considerable room for greater efficiency. 
  This problem was previously addressed by academician Ihor 
Yukhnovskyy who pointed out that gas use could be reduced by at 
least 25 billion cubic meters. A more rational approach to 
efficient utilization of our resources, exploratory efforts, 
strict regulation and legal sanctions against wasteful practices 
could improve our situation considerably. In addition, the best 
exploratory equipment should be obtained from abroad in 
combination with appropriate political and diplomatic 
initiatives. 
  Unfortunately, the government generally relies on 
administrative sanctions, and its efforts have been limited to 
construction of a new, semiprivate terminal near Odessa. 
  Search for new gas fields is in disarray. Half of the 
boreholes remain unused because of lack of special pipes, and 
only three of 12 new gas fields scheduled for production this 
year are being developed. Because of lack of funds geologists 
have almost stopped exploratory projects. Exploitation of the 
Sea of Azov and Black Sea shelves lies in the distant future. 
The reserves of the available fields are too small and 
production is too costly because the fields are too scattered. 
On paper everything looks fine, but in practice the national 
energy program has too many holes in it and Russia is using this 
knowledge to her advantage. 
  What will our delegates do at the next meeting in Moscow? I 
could get no answer despite making every attempt to get such 
information from the ministries and departments that are 
involved in these negotiations. Kovalko, the director of 
Derzhkamnafthaz, on returning from Moscow immediately repaired 
to Poltava for pre-election campaigning for a parliamentary 
seat. Yevhen Sukhin, his first deputy, didn't have a minute to 
spare for me for a telephone interview. Viktor Hladush, Deputy 
Minister of External Economic Relations, was also conscientious 
in avoiding me, and a fierce secretary blocked my access to 
Valentyn Kolomiyev, Director General, UKRHAZPROM. Anatoliy 
Volkovskyy, First Deputy-Head of Derzhpromresursy, escaped 
through a side door. Their assistants -- heads of various 
administrations and departments -- angrily rebuffed me with "We 
will not give you any information! We have received no 
instructions on this score; we don't know what course of action 
we will take!" 
  So what are the conclusions? Basically, we see a repetition 
of last year's story with the Black Sea fleet which Ukraine 
agreed to give up to Russia and the current defense minister 
finds it an acceptable solution. I am certain an analogous 
outcome awaits the `gas talks' if Ukrainian interests are 
betrayed. The pipelines should have only one owner! Russia is 
demanding prepayments from us, and we should demand prepayments 
from Russia for using our distribution networks.

<F P=106> [Interview with Serhiy Hryhorovych Osyka, deputy minister of </F>
foreign economic relations and trade, by Yuliya Vorontsova: "Not 
To Become an Outsider in the Competition With Our Eastern 
Neighbor: Task No. 1 for Ukraine's Foreign Economic Policy"] 
  [Text] According to the estimates of competent 
persons, the hryvnya has greater chances of seeing the world 
nowadays than at any previous time. That is, of course, provided 
that the new parliament does not begin its own activity by 
revoking all the accomplishments of its predecessor, and 
provided that the newly constituted government does not shatter 
to smithereens the delicate little porcelain bridge which has 
just recently connected Ukraine with the world's financial 
whales. In the opinion of Serhiy Osyka, deputy minister of 
foreign economic relations and trade, there are two realistic 
ways to introduce a sound monetary unit--a quick way and a 
slower but more durable way. The choice must be made now. 
  [Vorontsova] Serhiy Hryhorovych, to what extent was the 
question of forming a stabilzation fund under the hryvnya roused 
from its slumber during the latest visit by the president of 
Ukraine to the United States? It is certainly a well-known fact 
that this problem has been under discussion in the IMF 
[International Monetary Fund].... 
  [Osyka] Indeed, this question has been worked on for several 
years now; without a sound currency it is impossible to carry 
out an effective economic reform. The requirements set forth by 
the IMF are directly tied in with the need to restore our money 
to good health: in its volume a stabilization fund of whatever 
currency must not exceed the value of a country's imports during 
a period of three to four months. In and by itself, our decline 
in production is forgivable, but its sum-total was a bit too 
much. The stabilization fund can be formed along various lines. 
It can be done not only by enlarging and increasing our exports, 
but also by changing their quality. Because Ukraine, of course, 
Ukraine is not merely a traditional producer and supplier of 
metal. If--thanks to joining GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade) and signing a memorandum on cooperation with the EC 
[European Communities]--our high-tech goods (helicopters, 
rockets, and space satellites) can be introduced onto the world 
market, our state's hard-currency funds will grow sound very 
soon indeed. And that would also apply to the stabilization fund. 
  [Vorontsova] And so it could be said that the absence of a 
sound currency in Ukraine has brought about not only the 
economic crisis, but also the lack of appropriate international 
documents. Without the latter even the best Ukrainian items will 
not see the world any farther than our republic-level center for 
exhibits and fairs. Isn't that correct? 
  [Osyka] That's the way matters stood until very recently. A 
breakthough occurred literally during the last two months--first 
and foremost, after the change in the American policy with 
regard to Ukraine as a result of Kravchuk's signing the 
trilateral declaration in Moscow. Work is now proceeding on the 
preparation of credits from the IMF--something which we have not 
succeeded in obtaining for almost two years now. The first few 
steps have been taken toward cooperating with the Americans in 
the high-tech field. In and by itself alone, the launching of 
commercial satellites would bring in billions of hard-currency 
units within a very brief period of time. This change in the 
stance taken by the United States has likewise brought about a 
new policy with regard to Ukraine on the part of the "Big Seven" 
states. It has also evoked interest from the countries of 
Southeast Asia--countries which have very good future prospects 
and which are developing at a tempestuous pace. Prospects are 
opening up for the introduction of new credit lines and for 
expanding our own trade possibilities by means of selling abroad 
those items which we were unable to sell previously because of 
certain political and legal obstacles. 
  [Vorontsova] But the domestic economic situation in our 
state 
has remained unfavorable: The reforms are marking time, 
privatization has just begun, and one hears complaints from 
economic experts to the effect that inflation is being warded 
off by artificial means.... 
  [Osyka] I would not assert these things so categorically. 
Where do you get the idea that we don't have privatization? And 
what about the housing fund, and even available housing? And 
what about the leasing of enterprises, many of which often are 
converted into properties owned by the collectives involved? But 
the only realistic remedy against inflation is to increase the 
mass of goods. It can be increased in two ways. The first is 
calculated to take a 10-year period: This involves modernizing 
and renovating our production facilities, as well as 
restructuring the economy itself. The second way is faster: It 
solves the problems by political and legal methods--via 
privatization, when a certain quantity of goods of the requisite 
commercial quality have appeared on the market. The money supply 
would then form a kind of enclosed circle or loop and be full in 
the financial sense. Such a method would ensure an abrupt 
stabilization of the monetary system. Money would be put to 
work, and other motivation for persons to work would begin to 
appear. 
  [Vorontsova] In emphasizing the prospects for the political 
and legal way, you indicated that cooperation with GATT and the 
EC would be on a new basis.... 
  [Osyka] Until Ukraine becomes a member of GATT, it will be 
confined by numerous tariff barriers and administrative 
restrictions from selling its own best goods. After we have 
joined in this agreement, we will become a full member of the 
world economic space. Certainly, new problems will continue to 
arise. For example, lowering our import tariffs will further 
exacerbate the position of those enterprises of ours which turn 
out products which cannot compete with better ones from abroad. 
But we simply cannot go on subsidizing such enterprises. GATT 
has 117 members. It is not just a club for the great trading 
"whales," but also contains 2/3 of the countries with 
transitional types of economies--a category to which Ukraine 
likewise belongs. The GATT mechanisms provide for a balancing of 
interests between large, small, developed, and almost backward 
countries.... As to the prospects for cooperation with the EC, a 
system of versatility would be set up, i.e., the attitude toward 
our products on the market would have to be the same as for 
those economic entities of the EC member-countries. At the 
latest round of talks with the EC there was a discussion of 
possible cooperation between the Ukrainian National Space Sgency 
and the European space agencies. 
  [Vorontsova] Wouldn't that aggravate our mutual relations 
with Russia? 
  [Osyka] No. Because, of course, both GATT and the EC have 
worked out precise mechanisms for regulating the relations in 
the free-trade zones and the customs unions. Russia itself will 
join GATT quite soon, and if we lose time, we could remain an 
outsider in relations with our Eastern neighbors.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Ukrainian Government Considers </F>
That Canada Has Begun an Antidumping Investigation Against the 
Azovstal AT Without Any Grounds for Doing So"] 
  Four Canadian producers of carbon steel--Algoma Steel, Inc., 
Steelco, Inc., Ipso, Inc., and CNT Steel--have begun a "hunting 
season" on the exporters of steel to Canada. Over the period of 
the first eight months of last year 40 percent of the imports of 
this metal to the country of the maple leaf were designated as 
dumping. Toward the end of last year Ukraine was added to the 
list of the other three "violators"--Spain, Italy, and Korea. On 
18 October Canada's Department of National Profits instituted an 
antidumping suit against the Azovstal AT [Joint-Stock Company], 
which is located in Mariopol. According to this department's 
data, the average price of Ukrainian steel is set at only 76.1 
percent of its true value (the dumping mark ranged from 69.5 to 
83.3 percent). 
  Despite the fact that during the period since 1991 the 
states 
of the EC [European Communities] and America have instituted 
nine antidumping suits against Ukraine, this latest instance 
cannot have the best influence on mutual relations between 
Ukraine and Canada. On Ukraine's part, this case is being 
handled by the intersector and interministerial commssions which 
have been set up under the Ukeainian Council of Ministers. As is 
known, the Ukrainian side has the intention of striving to close 
this case because of the lack of direct proofs that the Azovstal 
AT has engaged in any antidumping operations in the Canadia 
market. It is also known that--in the case at hand--Ukraine is 
allowing for the possibility of appealing to higher 
international juridical institutions. 
  The fact of the matter is that last year Azovstal delivered 
14,000 tonnes of steel (FOB at the Ukrainian port) to the German 
firm of Klopner at a price between 258,000 and 259,000 U.S. 
dollars. The Germans re-exported 7,800 tonnes of this amount to 
Canada. It was specifically the steel re-exported by Klopner 
that became the occasion for the antidumping investigation. But 
according to the contract between Azovstal and Klopner, the 
former bears no responsibility for any further profits made on 
the steel sold to the German firm. Moreover, officials in Kiev 
have asserted that the export price of this steel from the 
Mariopol AT corresponds to the upper limit indicated (260 U.S 
dollars), as well as to the average level of world prices. 
  In elucidating the pluses and minuses for Ukraine in this 
case, far from the last-place role will be played by yet another 
global factor. In the case at hand, according to all 
international standards, the responsibility for the actions of 
the accused Azovstal AT shall be borne by the state as a whole, 
inasmuch as--at present--the Ukrainian economy has the status of 
a nonmarket economy. Proceeding on the grounds that Ukraine did 
not give Canada sufficient information about its exporters, the 
Canadian side was compelled to apply with regard to Ukraine the 
same conditions under which Belgium, Denmark, Spain, and Great 
Britain operate in Canada. And Great Britain was designated as 
the analogous country (it has been asserted that--on this 
occasion--even the Canadians felt sorry for Ukraine); and, as a 
result of this, the benchmark price was set at 500 U.S. dollars 
per tonne. 
  It is interesting that almost immediately after this 
conflict-type situation arose, the Ukrainian office of the 
Canadian firm Smith, Lyons, Torrance, Stevenson, and Mayer 
offered to defend the Ukrainian interests in this case. In the 
words of Mark Kovalskyy, a lawyer from this firm, the offer 
would have legal force only on condition that the Ukrainian 
government make an official request with regard to a defense of 
its rights. At the same time Klopner would have to provide its 
own lega defense in cooperation with Azovstal. However, a 
contractual agreement had been signed with the Trakon law firm 
at the very end of last year--that is, after the case had 
already been instituted. And, therefore, Trakon has remained on 
the sidelines of this investigation. Thus Azovstal could take a 
retroactive court action against Klopner in connection with the 
nonperformance on that article in the contract which concerns a 
legal defense. 
  The recent visit by a Ukrainian delegation to Canada did not 
produce the anticipated results. Official Kiev intends to place 
the examination of this case before the Canadian Trade Tribunal 
because it considers that it would be significantly better to 
defend its own interests there. At least its chances would look 
more realistic with the absence of tricks by Canadian industry. 
According to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), 
dumping is not subject to condemnation, provided that it does 
not cause harm to the enconomy of that country in which the 
goods are sold. And the percentage of Ukrainian steel within the 
total amount of this metal on the Canadian market is less than 1 
percent. The Canadian side, in turn, does not dispute this 
point, but instead bases its argument on the position 
that--after an analysis had been conducted--it was discovered 
that 100 percent of the total amount of the Ukrainian steel had 
been sold on the Ukrainian market at dumping prices. 
  Yet another possible relief for Ukraine (even prior to 
appealing the case) could be the negotiations which are now 
going on between Klopner and Algoma Steel with regard to the 
delivery of Azovstal's steel ingots. By the way, it is an 
interesting situation. The guilty party in these 
Ukrainian-Canadia misunderstandings--the German firm of 
Klopner--has, for some reason retreated to the background, and 
for some reason nobody is saying much about its role in this 
matter. 
  ...If the Ukrainian government believes that it will prevail 
in the above-mentioned Trade Tribunal, knows that the law is on 
its side, and that such accusations are without any grounds, it 
must make sure that--after this case-- nobody will treat us like 
a little boy to be beaten--one who can be infringed against and 
who will then only whine and whimper.

<F P=106> [Interview with Oleksandr Nezdolya and Vyacheslav Zhyhun, </F>
managers of shareholding company Ukrayina, by Valentina 
Pysanska: "Better to Be Rich and Expensive"] 
  [Text] Perhaps there is no other company in the field 
about which there have been as many rumors as have circulated in 
business circles about the activities of the international 
shareholding trading and finance group Ukrayina, founded a year 
ago. To an extent, their appearance can be explained by the fact 
that the firm is trading in an area which has been one of the 
mainstays of the state's income. 
  A HOLOS UKRAYINY correspondent wanted to get 
information from the horse's mouth, as they saying goes. I 
dialed the number of the First Deputy Executive Officer 
Oleksandr Ivanovich Nezdolya, and heard from him: 
  "You are a little late, since I have been just 
appointed deputy industry minister. With your permission, I 
would like to introduce you to the new manager, Vyacheslav 
Zhyhun, deputy executive officer and chairman of the board of 
the shareholding group. 
  After I expressed regret at not being able to speak to 
the person who had been present at the creation of the firm, 
Oleksandr Ivanovich, surprisingly, graciously agreed to a 
three-way conversation. 
  As a result, I offer to the attention of the readers an 
interview which I recorded with both the former and the current 
managers of shareholding group (SG) Ukrayina, Oleksandr Nezdolya 
and Vyacheslav Zhyhun. 
  [Pysanska] Please tell us about the structure of your 
shareholding group? 
  [Zhyhun] SG Ukrayina was formed on the foundation of state 
enterprises with the participation of foreign capital. 
  [Nezdolya] You see, our firm was created in December 1992, 
when in Ukraine a rapid decline of economic activity was 
underway, including in the foreign trade area. The government 
was trying to find a way to stop this decline. At the time, many 
enterprises were allowed to sell their output in foreign 
markets. Due to the lack of pricing information and marketing, 
as well as the presence of both honest and shady partners, a lot 
was sold but only a small portion of the proceeds found its way 
to the state foreign exchange treasury. 
  Naturally, this could not go on indefinitely. In those 
circumstances, the managers of five plants, with the consent of 
their labor collectives and the support of the Cabinet of 
Ministers, formed SG Ukrayina. Those are enterprises which 
produce mineral fertilizers-- concern Styrol in Gorlovka and 
production association Azot in Severodonetsk, Cherkassy and 
Dneprodzerzhinsk--the Odessa port and Donetsk metallurgical 
plants and conglomerates Kryvorizhstal and Zaporizhstal. As 
founding enterprises, they own 65 percent of statutory capital. 
On the one hand, the SG's task was to use its funds to maintain 
stability at the enterprises and in industry. On the other hand, 
it had to fill state orders and fulfill state contracts. Thus, 
hard currency obtained for fulfilling state contracts went 
entirely to the state currency fund, while funds which came from 
filling state orders were used to buy raw materials and 
equipment. Not just for the shareholding plants but for 
enterprises of the chemical and other industries. 
  [Zhyhun] The founding of SG Ukrayina in that economic 
situation did not take place because one person or a group of 
people wanted it. Oleksandr Ivanovich has already listed the 
main reasons prompting the government and management to take 
this step. I want to focus attention on the fact which few 
remember: one of the main tasks of SG Ukrayina was to support 
the severely ailing and weakened chemical industry. It was an 
industry which enjoyed steady demand in foreign markets. In no 
circumstances should that industry have been allowed to decline 
because of the sharp rise of energy prices. In fact, the use 
of funds from the SG's export operations to purchase raw 
materials, equipment and packaging for the chemical industry 
helped prevent further weakening of strong enterprises and a 
collapse of weak chemical plants. 
  [Pysanska] In effect, SG Ukrayina has become a powerful 
monopoly. 
  [Zhyhun] It is not so. The firm sold only 60 percent of its 
shareholders' output, which consists of ammonium carbonate, 
ammonia, ammonium nitrate, pig iron and rolled steel. At the 
same time, Kryvorizhstal and the Donetsk metallurgical plant 
sold their products independently. Since the foundation of the 
shareholding group, a total of $173 million worth of output has 
been sold, and $76 million worth of products has been purchased 
for Ukrainian industry. This includes raw materials, equipment 
and chemicals to protect agricultural crops, the purchase of 
which, incidentally, helped double the crop. The remaining funds 
went to purchase equipment, packaging and raw materials for the 
SG's founding shareholders. 
  [Pysanska] There was a major scandal about those purchases. 
In particular, you were accused of purchasing environmentally 
unsafe pesticides. 
  [Nezdolya] After a thorough investigation by law enforcement 
organs, the case was dropped due to the lack of evidence of 
criminal activity. 
  [Pysanska] It is said the SG Ukrayina is engaged in dumping, 
i.e., it is selling at artificially low prices. 
  [Zhyhun] It is impossible. First, we are being constantly 
monitored by the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance 
and the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. In addition, we 
are working with foreign firms which have experience in world 
markets. Selling at artificially low prices would have been 
unprofitable for us as well as for them. 
  [Pysanska] At the start of the discussion you mentioned that 
SG Ukrayina is an entity formed on the foundation of state 
enterprises with the participation of foreign capital. So, among 
its founders there is also a foreign company. Is true that it is 
the notorious Syabeco? 
  [Nezdolya] It is true, as is the fact that the head of the 
SG 
Ukrayina managerial board is Syabeco owner Borys Birshtein. 
Incidentally, that firm's share of the shareholders' capital is 
35 percent. Accordingly, it receives dividends amounting to 
slightly more than one third, minus 5 percent (after taxes and 
current expenditures), which SG Ukrayina charges as a commission 
for acting as an intermediary in foreign trade. 
  I must state that Syabeco has not done any harm to our 
country. Nothing but good. With full responsibility I can attest 
that Mr. Birshtein is a decent, enterprising human being endowed 
with a considerable brain. If the government of our country had 
specialists such as he, we may not have wound up where we are 
now. When SG Ukrayina was being formed, the country had no funds 
to launch it. Syabeco gave us credit. 
  [Pysanska] How much? 
  [Nezdolya] Sufficient for us to function. You know, when 
good 
money is being made, all sorts of rumors start around it. Of 
course Borys Birshtein is not a do-gooder. He has come to 
Ukraine to make money. But he is not here to steal and run away. 
In 1993, he gave us $20 million at a minuscule interest rate to 
buy chemicals for crop protection. He is currently looking for 
an opportunity to buy natural gas from Russia. This means the 
livelihood for factories and for the people who work there. Here 
is an honest partner. 
  [Zhyhun] In addition, as for our relationship with Syabeco, 
on the request of people's deputies it was investigated by the 
tax inspection and the appropriate Ukraine State Security (USS) 
organs, who found neither violations, nor abuses, nor any other 
fraud on the part of that firm. Moreover, Mr. Birshtein is not 
only a businessman but a person to whom the fate of our country 
is not indifferent. He did not come here to rob us but to teach 
us how to trade at a civilized level, and to establish strong 
business ties which would continue to grow and create profits 
for both sides. Besides, Syabeco is helping our country in a 
very difficult hour. Borys Birshtein and his partners, unlike 
many others, are not waiting until we start living better. 
Believe me, this is the proof of the solidity of the firm, and 
its good, long-term intentions. 
  [Pysanska] You have mentioned the USS. I have information 
that its organs control SG Ukrayina. You, Oleksandr Ivanovich, 
are--what?--a general of that service? 
  [Nezdolya] There is no secret about it. Do not beat around 
the bush: I am indeed a USS general. 
  [Pysanska] So, the USS is now selling mineral fertilizers? 
  [Nezdolya] Who told you that? I have not signed a single 
contract but only acted as an operational liaison with the 
government, informing about the situation in the foreign markets 
and foreign companies which do business with us. However, had in 
1992 enterprise directors independently entered the 
international market without proper experience, their lack of 
skills would have harmed Ukraine and caused a shock among their 
foreign partners. 
  Our responsibility is to protect economic sovereignty of our 
country and its security in this area. There is a great need for 
this, since today hundreds of firms come to Ukraine, many of 
which do not really exist. They promise a gold mine, earn a 
quick buck and disappear without a trace. 
  [Pysanska] And there is no other way aside from involving 
special services? 
  [Nezdolya] I understand what you want to say. But our work 
is 
not surveillance and eavesdropping. We must protect productive 
industry sectors, join the civilized world and establish market 
relations. We must find the end-user, in order to reduce the 
number of intermediaries. Yet, we lack experience and skills. 
  So, let directors learn. SG Ukrayina has a new type of 
managers working for it, ones who have studied to trade in the 
international market, both at home and abroad. Our job will be 
to combat mafia structures and corruption. There is a difference 
between honest money making and robbery. 
  [Pysanska] Excuse me, there is this cynical joke: you cannot 
defeat mafia in Ukraine; you can only lead it. 
  [Nezdolya] To think like this is the beginning of an end. 
But 
no matter what you say, we are protecting the country's economic 
independence. Ten other special export entities have now been 
set up along the same lines as SG Ukrayina. I am convinced that 
all this disorder and stealing of state property which still 
goes on here exists only because everything is cheap: both raw 
materials and labor. We, conversely, should become rich and 
expensive. 
  Today, SG Ukrayina is still learning to trade. Nevertheless, 
it has already performed a great service to the state. It is 
important to understand how useful such entities will be if they 
establish themselves in the world market, develop a system of 
export and import operations and obtain the necessary working 
capital. It should be noted that the activities of such entities 
are constantly being monitored by law enforcement 
organs--Ukrainian ones, too. I am convinced that the future--at 
least the immediate future--belongs to such entities. There is 
no other way for us.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmytro Lykhoviy: "Middle Eastern Motifs in </F>
Ukraine's Banking Policy"] 
  [Text] The opposition between the National Bank and 
the Cabinet of Ministers reminds one somehow of the situation in 
the Middle East: People know how it began, but they do not know 
how long it will last or how it will end. To continue this 
parallel, the stance taken by a certain number of government 
people--supported by the agrarian lobby--with regard to the 
necessary allocation of more than 50 trillion karbovantsy to the 
rural areas for the purpose of carrying out sowing operations 
may be compared to the peace initiative of one of the Middle 
Eastern sides. They have said something like the following: Come 
to an agreement on this large-scale currency emission; let's 
smoke a peace pipe, and everything will be just fine. However, 
the monetarist course taken by the NBU [National Bank of 
Ukraine] does not provide for sowing at such a high price. (In 
response to such a demand from the agrarians, one of the 
National Bank's highest officials even allowed himself to make 
the following bitter joke: "Do you intend, then, to sow 
coupons?"). It must be acknowledged that most of the government 
authorities have already become aware that the greatest evil is 
such hyperinflation, and that it must be combatted. After 
emphasizing this thesis once again, Viktor Yushchenko--NBU's 
chairman of the board--at a regularly schedule meeting with 
journalists elucidated the key positions taken by the National 
Bank with regard to conducting monetary policy, the price of 
money, and a possible currency emission. 
  According to Yushchenko, the National Bank has seriously 
undertaken the task of putting a stop to soaring hyperinflation. 
Because of the latter's great rapidity, this task cannot be 
accomplished suddenly or abruptly; and, therefore, we must go 
along with it for some time, while seeking to restrain it. That 
is to say: If in 1994 Ukraine had a monthly inflation rate 
equalling 84 percent, then during the first quarter of this year 
it can be knocked down by only 20-30 percent. If in December the 
monthly currency emission amounted to 12 trillion, then in 
January it must be equal to 8 trillion. To account for this, the 
Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers must designate 4 trillion worth 
of savings. According to the National Bank's plan, Ukraine must 
gradually make the transition from the 80-percent monthly 
inflation jumps which characterized the end of 1993 to 
well-harmonized, constantly lowered, and sensible currency 
emissions during 1994 by means of what Yushchenko called an 
"economizing" system. The NBU has submitted a scheme for such a 
system to the Supreme Council for its approval and ratification. 
The success of this package can be guaranteed only by a 
well-coordinated, finance-budget and economic policy on the part 
of the government, the central bank, and the parliament. If with 
such an alliance no success is achieved within a brief time 
period on account of the NBU's exclusively monetarist powers, 
the time bomb which can be perceived even now will explode in a 
"cloud of blossoming white smoke." 
  Another key factor in the National Bank's monetary policy is 
a positive, favorable interest rate. The bank has set a nominal 
rate equal to 20 percent per month (which amounts to an annual 
rate of 240 percent) and does not see the need to adjust it 
upward to the level of the monthly inflation rate. We need to 
tie inflation in to the price of money rather than the other way 
around. If this price is set, for example, at the inflation rate 
which prevailed as of November 1993--i.e., 84 percent--no 
operating budget or economic plan could endure such torture. A 
critical percentage rate must be set, and the state's entire 
anti-crisis policy must be keyed to that rate. Talk within the 
government to the effect that such a rate would be a 
hyperinflationary factor is absurd. Only Ukraine is capable of 
discussing such a topic. Academic theory excludes even the 
possibility of any kinds of disputes on that score. 
  Yet another important factor in stabilizing the Ukrainian 
monetary unit is currency regulation. Ihor Mityukov, the 
National Bank's leading expert on this matter and the NBU's 
deputy chairman of the board, has called currency regulation an 
important instrument in the matter of regulating exports and 
imports and eliminating the deficit in our foreign balance of 
payments. Recently, however, because of the universality of VKV 
[freely convertible currency] the currency policy has become 
confused and is being replaced by a policy of taxation, customs 
duties, and export-import fees. The right to twirl foreign 
currency around is being taken into the hands of the government, 
leaving to the National Bank the role of an observer of a 
downward slope and the declining potential to carry out currency 
operations to the point where they amount to worthless tokens. 
The divergence in the approaches to the organization and 
instrumentality of the currency market, as well as the 
difference in views on creating exchange rates provide several 
more occasions for comparing their dispute with the Middle 
Eastern conflict: Yushchenko's National Bank is Yushchenko's 
National Bank, whereas Zvyahilskyy's government is Zvyahilskyy's 
government, and they will never get together on matters policy 
regarding currency or exhange rates. According to Mityukov--whom 
we mentioned earlier--currency exchange rates ought to be under 
the jurisdiction of the NBU, but the Cabinet of Ministers thinks 
"a bit" differently and has called the fixed exchange rate 
"12610" the most important element in the policy of state 
regulation. A small ray of hope with regard to the possibility 
of making the transition to a course of regulations has been 
dashed--perhaps even extinguished by the National Bank's deputy 
chairman of the board; there is simply no mutually agreed-upon 
scheme of regulation. In principle, such an opposition is not 
normal; they understand this at the NBU and, therefore, act on 
the basis of the following principle: "The sensible man does not 
go up the mountain--the sensible man goes around the mountain." 
There is already agreement with the machine-builders and miners 
concerning the sale of currency on auction-type principles. Nor 
has agriculture been forgotten (in order to assist rural 
inhabitants in finishing their sowing, the National Bank has 
decided to buy up the dollars saved by such inhabitants--at a 
price of 30,000 krb. [karbovantsy] for one dollar. 
  One of the components of the currency market--the NBU's 
currency auction--is likewise experiencing some rather unhappy 
times: Offers have stabilized at the level of 8-9 million 
dollars a month; as a result of already-adoptedemissions 
decisions, demand has risen sharply. The fixed rate of exchange 
for the karbovanets is depressing exporters, and--therefore--an 
increase in the rate of exchange at the auctions will hardly be 
able to provide more available freely convertible currency. The 
situation is tragic. In order to provide shelter for those many 
producers who have not been able to make their way to the tender 
committee, the NBU retained the auction but was forced to yield 
to administrative restrictions in accepting conditions for 
buying currency. The circle of restrictions will thereby become 
somewhat wider; moreover, the auction will continue to operate 
for some time, ensuring--first and foremost--the purchase of 
energy resources, raw materials, and technical needs. 
  ...Viktor Yushchenko has recently begun to gather 
journalists together quite frequently. He does not complain to 
them, but merely tells them about his own work. Operating under 
the conditions of opposition and misunderstanding is difficult 
and often thankless--something like being forced to spit into 
the wind, when one feels like spitting in all directions and 
going on to something else. It seems that only the National Bank 
is bearing in mind the fact that rescuing drowning persons is 
largely a matter for the very persons who are drowning. In the 
wondrous country of the Swan, the Crab, and the Pike Middle 
Eastern motifs have not abated.
