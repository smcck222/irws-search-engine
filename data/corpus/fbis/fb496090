<F P=106> [Article by John Spira] </F>
  [Text] Armscor's [Armament Corporation of South Africa] net 
income declined by R44.4 million [rand] to R40.2 million in the 
year to March. 
  The bulk of the decline stemmed from a R29.6 million 
reduction (to R196.5 million) in the government's allocation for 
operating and technology expenditure, with the balance coming 
mainly from additional spending in the areas of market 
promotion, legal proceedings and upgrading of computer network 
cabling. 
  Sales were static at R110.2 million. 
  The net value of group assets rose by 15.6 percent to R338.1 
million. 
  Armscor is a public corporation and its financial results 
are 
therefore of interest primarily to the taxpayer. 
  It is an acquisition organisation and the financial results 
therefore do not reflect the scale of the activities in which it 
is involved. 
  Thus, for example, the acquisition cash flow for which it 
was 
responsible in 1993-94 totalled R4.5 billion. 
  A major portion (2.5 billion) of this cash flow went towards 
its aerospace portfolio, with the balance accounted for by 
vehicles and weapons, and electronics and maritime. 
  Because of reducing allocations of state funds for defence, 
Armscor is examining various areas to enable it to retain its 
capabilities, among them: 

  -  Making its acquisition services available to other public 
organisations. 
  -  Offering its counter-trade capabilities to South African 
industry at large. 
  -  Becoming involved in regional co-operation on defence in 
African and southern Africa. 
  -  Providing acquisition support to defence forces of other 
African states. 


    Chairman I.J. Moolman notes: "The proven capabilities of 
Armscor to determine client needs, to establish technology, to 
obtain military systems and equipment, both locally and abroad, 
and to provide life-cycle product support will be indispensable 
to the local security forces, as well as within the southern 
African region."

  [Text] Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South Africa] has 
developed an armored vehicle that it believes is as good as any 
tank being used by NATO or East Bloc forces. The total cost of 
development: 126 million rands. Marinus Wijnbeek reports that 
the tank demonstrates the technological capabilities of the 
South African arms industry. 
  [Begin recording] [Wijnbeek] The tank technology 
demonstrator, as it is called, bears little relation to the 
existing Olifant tanks used by the armed forces. An important 
feature of the tank is its suitability for the unique and harsh 
African conditions. A number of South African firsts are 
incorporated in its design. This is the first tank that has an 
adapted commercial engine and cooling systems which ensure crew 
comfort under the hot African sun. The gun sight is stabilized 
for all-round functioning and has a thermal night sight. Only 
the latest American Abrahms has a comparable sight. The tank 
commander has state of the art passive night vision. The gun on 
the demonstrator has a 105-mm caliber, but this will soon be 
upgraded to a South African developed 120-mm, and later a 140-mm 
barrel. The maneuverability of the tank and its cross country 
and road speeds are 35 and 71 km/h which aren't at all bad for a 
58.3-ton armored vehicle. It also has extensive crew safety 
systems in case it is hit by an enemy. This includes top 
protection. 
  [Armscor spokesman Andre Buys] This tank technology 
demonstrator will be used as a test-bed to evaluate new 
technology and to retain our armor system capability. It will 
also be used to market our upgrading capability. There is an 
attractive global market for the modernization of older 
generation armored vehicles. 
  [Wijnbeek] Impressive though it is, Armscor's latest 
fighting 
vehicle will probably not go into production. Although the 
tank's technology may find its way around the world, this 
demonstrator is likely to remain just that. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Africa Urged To Solve Own Problems -- "The `new vision for 
Africa' outlined by President Mugabe of Zimbabwe last week is 
yet another expression of what appears to be a growing 
determination throughout the continent to overcome its problems 
of poverty, backwardness, foreign debt and ethnic strife," 
begins the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 7 June in a 
page-10 editorial. "His vision of an Africa that will `take 
charge of its own development and learn from the lessons of the 
past' will have the ardent support of all Africans and of many 
of their First World creditors." The editorial continues, 
however, by warning that these solutions "must be more than 
interim remedies." "Whatever methods are adopted -- whether by 
the Southern African Development Community, the OAU or any other 
body -- they are unlikely to be effective unless they are based 
on two proven realities. First, that disputes are best resolved 
through negotiations and, second, that poverty is best combated 
by free enterprise." 
<H8>  BEELD </H8>
  White Referendum Issue Viewed -- "There is widespread 
appreciation for President Mandela's attempts to enter into 
negotiations with all parties and organizations as head of 
state. His willingness to negotiate with the right wing, even 
though they severely criticized him and his party during the 
election, is an example of his fairness," begins a page-6 
editorial in Afrikaans in the Johannesburg BEELD on 6 June. 
"However, the time has come for the president and his advisers 
to decide what course of action to follow as far as the right 
wing is concerned." "President Mandela has mentioned the 
possibility that a referendum could be held among whites or 
Afrikaners to test support for a homeland. Although that 
possibility will not be easily realized, it creates expectations 
and injects new life into a dying idea." "President Mandela 
should guard against creating the impression that he and his 
advisers are pandering to the demands of the far-right. It 
seems as if they have not fully realized that Dr. Ferdi 
Hartzenberg and Mr. Eugene Terreblanche do not really have 
noteworthy support. There is no burning desire among Afrikaners 
and/or whites for a referendum on a homeland. The overwhelming 
majority want to be part of the new order and want to be left in 
peace to make their contribution." 
  Peacekeeping Force Disbandment Welcomed -- A second 
editorial 
on the same page notes that "few people will shed tears over the 
disbanding of the National Peacekeeping Force. The project went 
ahead despite warnings that one would be looking for trouble if 
one took people with different backgrounds and threw them 
together for a quick training exercise." "The project costed 
the country millions. The old defense force gave 34 million rand 
from its budget to the peacekeeping force. In addition to this 
the huge salaries they demanded and received had a ripple effect 
on other sectors of the security forces. Maybe some of these 
soldiers can be drawn into the South Africa National Defense 
Force's planned service brigade. We only hope that if some of 
them are roped in to build roads and bridges that their work 
will be satisfactory."

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Call for Housing Action -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English 
considers "the housing challenge" in an editorial on page 12 of 
its 8 June edition. "The surge in urban land invasions is a 
head-on challenge to politicians to get down to the real work of 
redressing the legacy of apartheid," the editorial begins. "It 
is time for the rhetoric to get real and for specific 
allocations of land to be added to the endless figures of 
housing promises." Without such action, the editorial asserts, 
homeless people will continue their land occupations. It must 
be remembered, the paper argues, that the homeless are "first 
and foremost victims of our racial past." The editorial 
concludes by arguing that although the homeless "have an 
obligation to give the new government a chance to live up to its 
promises," it is nonetheless wrong "to victimise those whose 
illegal presence is a fait accompli. Nothing constructive is 
served by demolishing and confiscating flimsy shelters and 
interfering with freedom of movement. And quite the wrong 
message is sent to ordinary people on both sides of the 
conflict." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Suggestion of "Serviced Squatter Sites" -- The editorial in 
Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on page 10 on 8 June also 
considers the "crisis" caused by Johannesburg City Council's 
decision to tear down shacks of illegal squatters. "The council 
was wrong to tear down even makeshift homes in a spell of 
freezing weather, and it deserves censure. Yet the reasons 
behind its haste need to be examined." Noting that there are 
"costly consequences" to the illegal occupation of land, the 
editorial goes on to point out that if the squatters are 
"allowed to stay, the orderly provision of housing may become 
impossible." The editorial concludes by calling on Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging Premier Tokyo Sexwale and other 
authorities to consider the possibility of "serviced squatter 
sites" that, while not "proper housing," would still provide 
squatters with "freehold title, running water, sewerage, 
stormwater drains and tarred bus routes. People living there 
can aspire to improving their accommodation, through their own 
efforts or with the help of government's vast programme to 
provide solid, permanent homes." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  "Jackboot Tactics" Condemned -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in 
English, in an editorial on page 6 on 8 June, also criticizes 
the destruction of squatter shacks in Johannesburg. "The local 
authorities are normally in a difficult position when faced with 
the sudden occupation of land. But what is unacceptable is 
their insensitivity. Instead of breaking down shacks and 
letting families with children sleep outside in the cold, they 
should be looking for solutions....It certainly does not well 
for the local authority to use jackboot tactics of demolition to 
discourage illegal occupancy."

<F P=106> [Report by correspodent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] Good afternoon. Representatives of the government 
and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
[UNITA] have been holding a meeting in the Mulungushi Conference 
Center since this morning in the search for solutions to the 
issue of swearing in deputies for Jonas Savimbi's organization 
in Parliament. The issue has been under discussion since 3 June. 
The outcome of this meeting, which is also being attended by 
the mediators and observers, is not known. We will give further 
details later on. 
  Meanwhile, UNITA spokesman Jorge Valentim told the TIMES OF 
ZAMBIA today that his organization insists that the government 
grant UNITA key posts in the Foreign and Interior Ministries, as 
well as a number of posts at provincial government level, 
regardless of offers made by the Angolan authorities in a spirit 
of cooperation and national reconciliation. The TIMES OF ZAMBIA 
reports that diplomatic sources confirm UNITA's position. 
Moreover, Jorge Valentim also said that renewed military 
operations in the country are affecting the morale of his 
organization's negotiators. He also said that over the past few 
days the relationship with government representatives has become 
tense, and the two teams do not even shake hands before each 
working session as stipulated by the rules. 
  Meanwhile, diplomatic circles have expressed concern about 
the fate of the Angolan peace talks between the government and 
UNITA and appealed to mediator Alioune Blondin Beye, the troika 
of observers, the United States, Portugal, and Russia, to do the 
utmost to put an end to clashes in Angola, so that negotiations 
may be successful and a peace agreement signed. 
  The meeting between the government and UNITA teams has just 
been concluded. Unfortunately, after heated debates, the 
results are not the most desired ones. All that is known is 
that contradictions resulting from the UNITA team's ploys 
persisted in this working session. The negotiators will resume 
the talks this afternoon to continue discussing the 
abovementioned point which is becoming cantankerous.

<F P=106> [Report from Lusaka by correspondent Alves Antonio] </F>
  [Text] Good evening. The question of the swearing in of 
UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] 
members of Parliament is still on the negotiating table, 
although it has been under discussing for five days now. The 
UNITA representative is still evasive, thus hindering the 
debate. Today's morning and afternoon sessions lasted eight 
hours, but as a whole it was a totally unproductive day. 
Tomorrow, government and UNITA negotiators will return to the 
Mulungushi Conference Center to try to find a solution.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Yoweri Museveni by correspondent </F>
Judy Aslett in Kampala on 7 June; from the "Channel Four 
Newscast" -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Aslett] Do you accept any responsibility for the 
activities of the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]? 
  [Museveni] The only possible role Uganda played was one of 
example, because we also had our own problems here. We managed 
to fight the dictatorship and overthrow it, and those young 
people who were living here, they saw what we were doing, and as 
people with problems they said OK, maybe we can do the same in 
our own country -- you know the infectiousness, the contagion of 
ideas, how ideas spread. 
  [Aslett] Yesterday a senior Rwandan Government official 
accused you of supplying arms to the RPF, are you? 
  [Museveni] We are not supplying the RPF, that used to be the 
old accusation. We invited the United Nations to come and 
station themselves on the border -- right now they are there so 
this is all rubbish. 
  [Aslett] What has been your advice to the RPF, do you think 
this war is winnable? 
  [Museveni] It is possible they can take power, it is 
possible 
but they will have to do it slowly because they don't have the 
equipment. This is also another contradiction because if we 
were backing them as some people say, they would have very 
modern equipment -- more modern, they would fight a fast war, 
but the equipment they have from my intelligence is that it is a 
type that cannot fight a quick war. They may be good fighters, 
they may win in the end, but it will have to be slow, and the 
slower it is the bigger the humanitarian problems will become, 
displacement and so on and so forth. Since the (Arusha) 
agreement provided for power sharing, and since the recent 
resolution about the genocide provided for a international 
commission of inquiry, and also for an international tribunal to 
try the criminals, I think this would be a good moment to 
accept a cease-fire, and then utilize those two documents. 
  [Aslett] Do you think the United Nations has been slow to 
react to the war in Rwanda? 
  [Museveni] My answer is yes it has been too slow; that is A. 
But B: I don't know whether it could act faster, I am not so 
very sure that it could. 
  [Aslett] What do you see as the solution, how will the war 
be 
resolved? 
  [Museveni] Collective influence by all of us to keep on 
advising, talking. 
  [Aslett] Do you think it is possible in Rwanda? 
  [Museveni] I think so, because they have to either continue 
fighting or to have peace, that is the only alternative they 
have.

  [Text] Johannesburg June 7 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela 
said on Tuesday night his government would pursue negotiations 
with right-wing whites in spite of severe criticism from his 
supporters. 
  "In negotiations with representatives of the far-right 
parties we have found a new determination to resolve problems by 
peaceful means," he told a gathering organised by the National 
Peace Secretariat in Johannesburg to honour peacemakers. 
  "We do differ and differ sharply. But it is our obligation 
to ensure that these differences are thrashed out in rational 
discussions and negotiations." 
  He said many of his supporters believed that by talking to 
the right-wing the African National Congress was conceding too 
much. "They (our supporters) forget that when we launched the 
peace process the National Party [NP] was in the same position 
as the right-wing today. Today the NP is part of the government 
of national unity." 
  Mr Mandela said the most effective method of dealing with 
the 
right-wing was to use the power of persuasion and to point out 
the need to love other people. "Our obligation is to draw their 
attention to those issues that bind us, not separate us. The 
government will continue to pursue this course with a patient 
determination. We do recognise the moral and historical 
obligation to ensure that the wounds of the past are healed," he 
said. 
  Mr Mandela added his government would ensure maximum 
openness 
and disclosure so the healing process was meaningful, permanent 
and a beacon to future generations. In this regard, the "truth 
commission" announced earlier on Tuesday by Justice Minister 
Dullah Omar was aimed at reconciling the nation and not at 
retribution.

  [Text] Thirteen clergymen including bishops Vincent 
Nsengiyunva [of Kigali diocese] and Joseph Ruzindana have been 
killed by four soldiers of the Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA] who 
rebeled. The sad information was reported to us by our 
correspondent in the Butare-Gitarama region, Wilson Ndayambaje 
who was present yesterday when the political director of the 
RPA, Colonel Frank Mugambage, was announcing the sad news to 
journalists. 
  Before giving you a complete list of all the bishops and 
priests who were killed, let us see first how things happened. 
After the fall of Kabgayi at the hands of the RPA, 13 clergymen 
who were at Kabgayi were placed under the protection of eight 
soldiers of the RPA. But four of the soldiers who originate 
from Gitarama, left their comrades with whom they were supposed 
to ensure the security of the clergymen. They went to execute 
these clergymen. When the other four soldiers learned about 
this, they intervened and killed one of the rebellious soldiers 
while the other three ran away. Currently, a search is being 
conducted to find them and bring them to trial by a military 
tribunal. According to preliminary investigations, before 
evading the vigilance of their colleagues and going to 
accomplish their dirty job, the four boys, all from Gitarama, 
said that some of the bishops and priests had participated in 
the massacres perpetrated against the soldiers' families. The 
search for the three rebels continues so that they can be 
arrested and transferred for trial by the RPA. 
  The complete list of those killed is as follows: Bishop 
Vincent Nsengiyunva, Bishop Thaddee Nsengiyunva, Bishop Joseph 
Ruzindana, Monseigneur (Innocent Gasabwoya), Father Rwabalinda, 
Father Ndaberetse, Father Francois Murego, Father Ntamugabumwe, 
Father [name indistinct] Mutabazi, Father Kayibanda, Father 
Richard [name indistinct], Father Aime Uwimana and (?priest) 
(Fidele Gahunzire). God be with them.

  [Text] Kigali, June 8 (AFP) -- Rwandan rebels and the army 
fought fiercely on several fronts Wednesday [8 June] as their 
delegates came out of a new round of peace talks without a 
ceasefire accord, UN officials said. 
  A French cameraman was shot and wounded in the southwestern 
Nyamirambo district of Kigali where government troops and 
militiamen from Rwanda's Hutu majority have dug in to resist an 
assault by the mainly Tutsi rebels. 
  General Romeo Dallaire, the head of the UN Assistance 
Mission 
in Rwanda (UNAMIR) said the talks between general staff officers 
from the warring sides had been "very positive" and that they 
had agreed to meet again on Thursday. "We studied the principal 
document (put forward by UN mediators) and discussed the 
modalities of a ceasefire, but there is still work to be done," 
Dallaire said after after chairing the discussions. 
  Two months of clashes and ethnic bloodletting between the 
minority Tutsis and the majority Hutus have left up to 500,000 
dead and displaced another two million people, according to 
estimates by relief workers. Half a million Rwandans have fled 
abroad. 
  The warring sides met under UN auspices last week and came 
to 
an agreement on the security of UN relief operations and safe 
passage for civilians being evacuated, but failed to cut a 
ceasefire deal. 
  During a break in Wednesday's talks, rebel delegation chief 
Colonel Frank Mugambage said the RPF was insisting on "firm 
commitments" from the government, which the rebels want to halt 
massacres behind Hutu lines. 
  The RPF also wants pro-government radios to stop 
broadcasting 
incitements to ethnic slaughter. The army wants the civil war 
to stop before agreeing to anything. 
  After the previous round of talks last Thursday, Mugambage 
declared that the rebels were "capable of fighting and winning 
this war if that is the (only) option." 
  The rebels, who have the upper hand on the battlefronts, 
refuse to recognise the all-Hutu interim government formed after 
president Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in a suspected rocket 
attack on his plane on April 6. 
  The government has left Kigali for Gitamara, some 50 
kilometres (30 miles) from the capital, where further fighting 
was reported Wednesday. The RPF claims to have pushed back 
government counter- offensives in the area. 
  The French journalist, Jean-Christophe Klotz, 32, who works 
for the French film agency CAPA, was hit in the thigh as he 
accompanied aid workers in a visit to a school where displaced 
people have sought shelter from the fighting. He was taken to a 
hospital run by the International Committee of the Red Cross 
(ICRC), where medical staff said he needs rapidly to be 
evacuated from Rwanda, the ICRC delegation chief in Kigali, 
Philippe Gaillard said. 
  The Rwandan military delegation led by General Marcel 
Gatsinzi met the rebel team headed by Mugambage at the UN 
headquarters in the Amohoro hotel in northeastern Kigali. 
  The army's team was brought to the talks in a UN armoured 
vehicle, but the rebels later arrived aboard their own transport 
at the hotel, which lies in a district of the largely abandoned 
city controlled by the guerrillas. 
  Dallaire, a Canadian, chaired the talks exceptionally in the 
absence of his deputy, Ghanaian General Henry Anyidoho, who was 
unable to return to Kigali in time from a mission abroad because 
the airport was closed. 
  The United Nations suspended flights on Sunday after 
government troops fired a shell as a UN plane was on the tarmac 
at the airport, which is jointly administered by the rebels and 
UN forces.

  [Text] Tomorrow is a day of suspense in Zaire. It is, 
indeed, tomorrow that the High Council of the 
Republic-Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT] will appoint from 
among eight candidates the future prime minister of the country. 
The problem is that the hardline of the opposition against 
President Mobutu's regime did not deign to present Etienne 
Tshisekedi's candidacy. Indeed, the Sacred Union of the Radical 
Opposition and Allies [USORAS] feels the post of prime minister 
is not vacant because there is a prime minister named Etienne 
Tshisekedi. Ousmane Kaba reports: 
  [Begin Kaba recording] Each side interprets the new 
Constitution its own way. The infamous Article 78 is the bone 
of contention. One the one side is the Union for the Republic 
and Democracy [URD], really an extension of the opposition, 
regarded as a moderate group that supports the theory of a third 
party, which is to say in light of the permanent confrontation 
between Tshisekedi-Mobutu, there must be a third person who can 
cooperate with the president. On the other side is the Union 
for the Republic and Democracy, a kind of spontaneous generation 
of dissidents who, after joining the USORAS, wanted to create a 
third school of thought. There lies all the question because 
all the political unrest in Kinshasa during these past weeks is 
only the logical consequence of the interpretation of the new 
Constitution. 
  As for Tshisekedi, basing himself on his election at the 
Sovereign National Conference, he does not intend to support any 
list of candidates for the post of prime minister. For 
Tshisekedi, as long as the transition does not come to an end, 
there is only one prime minister: himself. Will the People's 
Palace be invaded again by the security forces like a few weeks 
ago? Or will the plenary session be postponed? That is the 
question. The URD confirms that the meeting will take place, 
while Tshisekedi's partisans strongly deny the information, 
ironically explaining that whether there is a meeting at the 
HCR-PT tomorrow or not, for Tshisekedi, the commission of 33 
deputies who will hold the meeting has no legal recognition. 
[end recording] 
  As Ousmane Kaba has just said, a delegation of 
representatives from France, Belgium, and the United States 
recently held discussions with the opposition leaders and 
Etienne Tshisekedi Wa Mulumba. This delegation was the bearer 
of messages from their governments. It delivered similar 
messages to President Mobutu Sese Seko yesterday. Regarding the 
contents of the messages received by the two Zairian 
politicians, here is (Lambert Mende), minister of communication 
in the Tshisekedi government: 
  [Begin (Mende) recording] We received a message that 
encourages power-sharing between President Mobutu and Prime 
Minister Tshisekedi. We received a message encouraging us to 
find a common solution to this crisis that has divided us both 
within the two political parties and in our own political party, 
by this I mean the problem of dissidents. I think Tshisekedi 
answered all these questions regarding dissidence by saying that 
there is a bipolarization of the constitution in this country. 
We are legalistic. Because of this bipolarization, our friends 
who left us to join President Mobutu could no longer consider 
themselves, while on President Mobutu's side, as people who can 
come and sit among us and be part of our quotas within the HCR 
and the transitional government. They can only aspire to this 
privilege when they come back to join the cause that we are 
defending and around which the USORAS, that is the Zairian 
opposition has built its project. [end recording] 
  The private press today echoed the criticisms leveled 
against 
France by the UDPS. For the PHARE, the appeal to boycott French 
goods at a rally on 5 June by Kiba Samaliba is nothing other 
than a declaration of a holy war that can recall the one being 
waged by the Islamic Salvation Front in Algeria [FIS] against 
French interests. The paper writes, and I quote, in both 
Kinshasa and the rural areas, people are convinced today that 
France does not deserve better than the war that the FIS has 
declared on it. 
  On its part, LE PALMARES, another newspaper close to the 
opposition, feels that France is a thorn in the side of Zairian 
democracy. The paper also wrote about the setting up of 
democratic process in Zaire in order to draw attractive 
dividends. 
  It will be recalled that at a UDPS rally on 5 June, Kiba 
Samaliba, a member of the leadership of this party headed by 
Etienne Tshisekedi, accused France of supporting a dictatorship 
in Zaire, that is President Mobutu's regime.

  [Text] Pretoria June 8 SAPA -- Provincial premiers met in 
Pretoria on Wednesday night for "confidential discussions" ahead 
of their meeting on Thursday with government ministers to 
discuss provincial executive powers. PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Premier Tokyo Sexwale said the 
premiers would meet from time to time in different regional 
capitals. 
  Only North-West Premier Popo Molefe, who is ill, was not 
present. He was represented by Satish Roopa. 
  The premiers will meet Constitutional Development Minister 
Roelf Meyer and Public Service and Administration Minister Zola 
Skweyiya in Pretoria for further discussions on provincial 
executive powers. 
  The meeting is a follow-up to a meeting in Cape Town last 
month and follows the removal by proclamation last Friday of all 
provincial powers. The powers were temporarily assigned to 
central government departments in preparation for their being 
devolved to the provinces. 
  The expectation is that most of the provincial premiers will 
apply to be able to exercise all of the powers determined by the 
constitution. While some of these powers can be exercised 
exclusively, others can only be exercised subject to the 
approval of the central government. 
  Mr Meyer said at a recent briefing he envisaged a process in 
which the provinces negotiated for powers from central 
government. 
  Apart from fulfilling constitutional provisions the 
provinces 
have to be able to demonstrate that their administrations will 
be in a position to administer the exercise of powers. This is 
especially difficult given that provincial administrations are 
being amalgamated with former homeland and self-governing 
territories' administrations. The process is far from complete. 
  In some cases a province might leave a function to the 
central government even though constitutionally it is entitled 
to administer that function on its own.

  [Text] A powerful task force comprising the communications, 
statistics and economic research arms of Government has been set 
up from President Nelson Mandela's office to drive the 
Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP). 
  The National Intelligence Service (NIS) is also set for a 
revamp and will be administered by Deputy President F.W. de 
Klerk, according to Government sources. A major announcement 
will be made next week about the NIS's new image, and changes to 
its senior management. 
  The two moves are the latest in a series of shake-ups of 
ministries and State departments as the multiparty Government 
shifts gear to tackle unemployment and poverty, and to address 
backlogs in education, health and other services. 
  Reliable sources say the SA Communication Service (SACS), 
Central Statical Service (CSS) and Central Economic Advisory 
Service (CEAS) are in the process of being placed under Minister 
Without Portfolio Jay Naidoo. The former labour leader, who is 
responsible for co- ordinating the RDP from the President's 
Office, has already approached the three organisations to set up 
working relationships. 
  The CSS and the CEAS will play the role of a think-tank to 
focus the RDP into disadvantaged and under-funded sectors, 
while, at the same time, monitoring progress and checking 
wasteful spending. The CEAS has already begun preparing a 
White Paper describing the nuts and bolts of the plan outlined 
by President Mandela in Parliament last months, according to CEA 
chief Jan Dreyer. 
  Dreyer pledged his service's support for Naidoo, saying he 
had already begun working closely with the Minister. 
  There is now a major shift in attitude towards addressing 
development and priorities, he said. An important party of 
CEAS's job would be to maintain fiscal discipline. 
  The full extent of the CSS's involvement in the RDP has not 
yet been spelt out but Naidoo has held discussions with its 
management and indicated it will fall under his jurisdiction, 
said highly placed CSS sources. The CSS would throw its weight 
behind the RDP but wanted to ensure that it could still perform 
its function at a professional level and protect the credibility 
of its data. 
  The CSS wanted to continue providing information to the 
private sector. "Where we can play a significant role is in 
monitoring the implementation of the RDP. The results should be 
quantifiable," the source said. 
  The SACS has also not yet been officially informed of its 
future position but its placement in the President's Office is 
being considered. One of its main jobs will be to report on the 
RDP's progress. 
  The SACS is currently under Constitutional Minister Roelf 
Meyer. This suited it during the transition, said a spokesman, 
but it would be beneficial now for it to fall under the 
President's Office. "Effective communication would be critical 
to the [process of reconciliation. 
  "We are always operating on behalf of other ministries but 
it 
would not be like that under the President because the SACS 
would not be easily annexed by one department alone," he said. 
  Another option on the table was for SACS to be taken over by 
Foreign Affairs, but this was less likely to happen. 
  The prevailing feeling was that most developed countries can 
target communication exclusively outward, but in a country like 
South Africa it should be mainly inward, the spokesman said.

  [Text] Ventersdorp June 7 SAPA -- The Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB] would have to 
continue its struggle "and even intensify it" following the 
rejection of the AWB's request for amnesty for right-wingers 
sentenced or awaiting trial, the AWB executive council said on 
Tuesday. The council was reacting to amnesty legislation 
announced by Justice Minister Dullah Omar on Tuesday. 
  It said in a statement the AWB had extended a hand in a 
"reasonable attempt to bring about peace in our beloved 
country". "We offered to call a halt to our struggle pending 
negotiations on a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] if they showed 
good faith by granting unilateral amnesty for all rightists, 
those sentenced and awaiting trial. This is, however, clearly 
excluded in Mr Omar's statement. It is now apparent to us they 
are not interested in the hand extended to them. They have 
treated our offer with contempt and have rejected it out of 
hand," the statement said. 
  It added: "The rejection of our reasonable offer means that 
our struggle must continue and even intensify."

  [Text] Pretoria June 8 SAPA -- The truth commission 
proposed by Justice Minister Dullah Omar was an "ambush" for 
opponents of the African National Congress, the Conservative 
Party [CP] said on Wednesday. The CP called for a "general 
amnesty" for all people who committed crimes with a political 
motive. The cut-off date for such an amnesty should be the date 
it is announced. 
  On Tuesday, Mr Omar announced that the government intended 
keeping the December 6, 1993 cut-off date for applications for 
amnesty from prosecution for offences committed with a political 
motive. 
  The CP had asked that the cut-off date be extended to 
include 
offences committed by rightwingers who set off a series of bomb 
blasts that killed 19 people shortly before the April elections. 
  The CP sharply criticised Mr Omar for saying opponents and 
defenders of apartheid would be treated differently. 
  Constitutional affairs spokesmAn Fanie Jacobs said the 
minister's statement differed to the interpretation of President 
Nelson Mandela's. He said the CP would approach Mr Mandela again 
if necessary. 
  The CP said thousands of African National Congress 
supporters 
had been given amnesty and release in terms of agreements 
between the ANC and the National Party and that these had 
occurred without a public statement of the offences for which 
amnesty had been granted. 
  "Public hearings in the remaining cases would affect non-anc 
members or supporters. This process implies an inherent unequal 
handling of the remaining cases," the cp statement said. 
  The composition of the commission would also reflect the 
minister's stance on the amnesty issue. The CP said it opposed 
the establishment of new structures to deal with an amnesty. 
  The December 6 cut-off date had been unilaterally decided 
upon by the government parties. 
  "In the time between December 6, 1993 and the completion of 
the elections there were many cases of violence such as the mass 
murder at Shell House, countrywide killings of policemen and car 
bombs at Johannesburg, Germiston and Jan Smuts aIrport. 
  "The election is now over and political violence has 
declined 
dramatically. It would be unrealistic in the determination of 
the cut-off date for the amnesty to ignore these facts," the CP 
said. 
  The party also criticised the appointment of Advocate Arthur 
Chaskalson as chairman of the Constitutional Court, saying he 
was an ANC supporter.

  [Text] Johannesburg June 8 SAPA -- The Pan Africanist 
Congress [PAC] on Wednesday expressed concern over the 
"one-sidedness and sectarian" terms of reference of the proposed 
"truth and reconciliation commission". In a statement in 
Johannesburg the organisation said all interested parties, 
including the PAC, should be invited to discuss these terms as 
well as the definition of a political crime before they were 
finalised. 
  "Of particular concern is the sectarian disqualification of 
the alleged killers of American student Amy Biehl from amnesty 
or indemnity," the statement said. 
  According to the PAC, their act was political in the sense 
that they were involved in a campaign in support of a South 
African Democratic Teachers Union strike initiated by the 
African National Congress in the Western Cape. 
  "The trust commission must take into consideration the 
definition of the enemy by those who purportedly committed 
violent acts," the statement said.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Truth Commission -- "The move by Justice Minister Dullah 
Omar 
to establish a Commission of Truth and Reconciliation is 
welcome, with one major reservation. The commission must -- if 
it is 'to enable South Africa to come to terms with its past' -- 
be evenhanded," begins the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 9 
June in a page 12 editorial. "A truth commission will fail if 
it seeks to extracts confessions from only one side as a 
prerequisite for indemnity." "State officials who committed 
atrocities against anti-apartheid activists should not be 
allowed to apply for and be granted indemnity in secrecy 
....but, by the same token, so must the killers, bombers and 
torturers in ANC ranks be fully exposed and forced to 
acknowledge their role in the abuse of human rights." "There are 
auspicious signs, too, that Omar will reject the sweeping 
definition of a political offence in the Further Indemnity Act. 
The definition must not allow people motivated by racial 
bigotry and blood-lust to escape punishment by labelling their 
actions 'political'. Too wide a definition will stain the book." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Truth Commission -- "Proposals to deal with any country's 
secret security operations pose major moral, practical and 
philosophical problems, particularly to new governments," begins 
the Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 9 June in a page 8 
editorial. Plans to create a truth commission "is sure to be 
welcomed but will also raise many questions. It is necessary 
for reconciliation for crimes against the people to be made 
public, but the problem arises as to the process after these 
revelations." "It would seem rather unfortunate that men who 
committed the most heinous acts on helpless victims of a 
political situation should be allowed to get off so easily." 
<H8>  CITIZEN </H8>
  Truth Commission -- "As we feared and warned against, the 
government is going to set up a Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission," states the Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 8 
June in a page 6 editorial. "We think the Truth Commission will 
be an inquisitorial body to 'smell out' those who allegedly 
committed atrocities and force them to make public penance for 
their deeds (unless, of course they volunteer to disclose their 
crimes and seek forgiveness). How this brings about 
reconciliation is beyond us. Eighteen months to two years of 
this kind of inquisition will keep all the hatreds alive, 
instead of helping to reconcile differences and bring about an 
end to the bitterness of the past." "It is also clear from Mr. 
Omar's remarks that atrocities committed by the ANC during its 
armed struggle will not require accounting before the Truth 
Commission, but the offences of those who killed ANC members or 
subjected them to 'dirty tricks' will be." If the government is 
not evenhanded, then the commission will be seen as an ANC 
"vendetta." 
  Government Urged To Trust De Klerk -- "Deputy President De 
Klerk must wondering why his major partner in the government has 
taken to querying decisions he made while he was State 
President," states an editorial on page 6 of the 7 June edition 
of THE CITIZEN. The first queried decision was the deal with 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi that transferred land to Zulu King 
Zwelithini. Most recently, De Klerk's judgment was questioned 
when it was disclosed that he granted indemnity to security 
force operatives. "What is most disturbing," concludes THE 
CITIZEN, "is the fact that Mr De Klerk's bona fides are brought 
into question. If the ANC trusts him, why call him to account 
for decisions he validly took while State President? Put 
another way, how can there be a government of national unity 
when there is disunity over such issues?"

  [Text] The field commander of the West African peacekeeping 
force, ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States 
Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], Major General John M. Inienger, 
has assured that in spite of all difficulties in the peace 
process, efforts are still being made at high levels to effect 
disarmament and pave the way for a democratically elected 
government in Liberia. 
  Gen. Inienger made the disclosure recently during his 
working 
visit to the Ugandan contingent at the SOS encampment village 
and the Tanzanian troops assigned at Carey near Gbarnga. The 
ECOMOG field commander said to ensure the implementation of the 
disarmament process, ECOMOG has already begun meetings and 
consultations with factional leaders and other players of the 
Liberian conflict for the resumption of the disarmament and 
deployment exercises. He then urged members of the peacekeeping 
force to continue their good work and not to be discouraged by 
attempts by the factions to frustrate their efforts. 
  Meanwhile, officers and soldiers of the Ugandan and 
Tanzanian 
contingents of expanded ECOMOG have been commended for 
exhibiting a high degree of tolerance and restraint in the face 
of extreme provocation by fighters of the armed groups. The 
commendation was made by the ECOMOG field commander, Maj. Gen. 
John M. Inienger, during his working visit to the locations of 
(Ugabart), (Sistring), and SOS encampment village and other 
[words indistinct] set aside at Carey and Gbarnga. 
  Referring to incidents in which nine Ugandan ECOMOG soldiers 
on a routine patrol were ambushed and abducted and others in 
which they were shot at without justification, the ECOMOG field 
commander said that the incidents were regrettable and 
unfortunate. He enjoined them to continue to exercise restraint 
and patience which, he said, were the cornerstone of 
peacekeeping. 
  Gen. Inienger observed that the task of the peacekeeper was 
not an easy one, citing as example the case of an unarmed 
Senegalese member of the small UN peacekeeping force in Rwanda, 
Captain [name indistinct], who was recently shot dead in Kigali, 
and ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] 
abduction of five Nigerian ECOMOG soldiers out of which three 
have been released. While at the same time of talking to them, 
two were still being held. However, he assured them that ECOMOG 
was totally behind them, irrespective of whatever happened. He 
referred to the recent spate of orchestrated accusations by the 
various armed groups, which tended to cast doubts on ECOMOG's 
neutrality in its efforts to bring peace to Liberia, saying that 
in peacekeeping if you are not accused it means that you are not 
working. 
  Gen. Inienger assured them that in spite of all the 
difficulties, efforts, including meetings, consultations are 
still being made at higher levels to effect disarmament and pave 
the way for a democratically elected government. He urged them 
to continue to endure until peace is finally achieved in Liberia 
because a large proportion of Liberians are still languishing as 
refugees. 
  The field commander has, meanwhile, promised to look into 
the 
administrative and logistics problems of the peacekeepers, 
especially in the areas of efforts to urge the United Nations to 
speedily pay them their stipends which had accumulated for 
several months. Gen. Inienger was accompanied by some of his 
principal staff officers and UNOMIL [UN Observer Mission in 
Liberia] officials.

<F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Well, Dr. Amos Sawyer used to be the interim 
president of Liberia but last year, when a new peace agreement 
between the warring factions took effect he had to step down as 
part of the deal. However, he has remained in the public eye 
and even continues to attract some controversy. Dr. Sawyer 
helps to run an organization called the Center for Democratic 
Empowerment which analyzes political developments in Liberia and 
helps to find solutions to the problems that may arise, but some 
people are accusing the organization of setting out to promote 
ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire 
Monitoring Group], the peacekeeping force which is trying to end 
the fighting in Liberia. Well, Cholo Brooks met Dr. Amos Sawyer 
in Monrovia and asked him for his response to that accusation. 
  [Begin recording] [Sawyer] Indeed, we have no qualms about 
promoting ECOMOG here for what ECOMOG is doing and what ECOMOG 
has done here. Now, we know there are a few warlords that for 
their own purposes may play down this effort. The fact that 
Monrovia and the refugee camps combined have perhaps two-thirds 
of the population of this country is an indication that people 
are running to ECOMOG-protected areas and there they find some 
security. 
  [Brooks] Okay, one thing that perhaps worries people or 
people always think of is that Amos Sawyer was a one-time 
president of the interim government and at that time he was 
advocating for lasting peace, and at the same time asking the 
people to lay down their arms, but still people are still having 
arms and there has been no progress yet. 
  [Sawyer] We are concerned and saddened by the fact that 
there 
is not so much progress with respect to disarmament but you see 
Liberians have to get deeply involved in this process. We 
cannot see disarmament as an activity that involves warlords, 
ECOMOG, and UNOMIL [UN Observer Mission in Liberia] and the rest 
of the Liberian society stands aside as spectators. Who are to 
be disarmed? They are young men but are Liberians. Where have 
they come from? They have come from our villages, they are part 
of our families, they have been associated with our schools and 
our churches and our mosques, and all of these and so the 
institutional heads and forces of all of these various 
structures should all bring their influence to bear on the 
process of disarmament. 
  [Brooks] Okay, back to the center itself. Is your center 
connected with any international institutions? 
  [Sawyer] We are a new outfit and we intend to go from 
strength to strength. We intend to begin (?giving) our modest 
resources, looking at the issues that are at hand here. We have 
just finished preparing our agenda for Liberia. We are now 
consulting with colleagues across this continent, largely in 
West Africa and in some related institutions in Europe and the 
United States. We are interested in applied research 
consultancy on these crucial problems of governance and we will 
seek resources from international sources basically to attack 
some of these problems and see if we can make some headway. 
  [Brooks] Okay, Dr. Sawyer, as you know there is a deadline 
with regard to elections in September and your organization is 
taking part in the coming election. How do you look at the 
(?date) set for the election to be held here? 
  [Sawyer] Well, first let me make some comments here that we 
are not going to take part in the election as an institution but 
we are very much interested in the development of a responsible 
electorate. We believe that at this stage in the development of 
Liberia, what we should be trying to come up with during the 
first postwar elections here is something of a grand convenant 
where a national convenant will be agreed upon by political 
parties and leaders so we do not find a "winner-take-all" 
situation and that we can move smoothly through the first six 
years of the postwar era with all hands on board attacking the 
problems of reconciliation and reconstruction. [end recording]

  [Text] Lagos, June 8 (AFP) -- Nigerian pro-democracy 
activists called Wednesday [8 June] for mass protests and civil 
disobedience next week to bring down military ruler General Sani 
Abacha. 
  The Campaign for Democracy said that from next week, "market 
women and men should lock their shops, drivers and transport 
owners should remove their vehicle from the streets. Workers 
should stay off their offices. 
  "Our brothers and sisters in the armed forces and the police 
are advised to take side with the civil society," it added. 
  The struggle between the Nigerian government and opposition 
has intensified in recent weeks with the opposition accusing the 
regime of dragging its heels over a return to democracy after 
annulled elections and a military coup last year. 
  However, a nationwide umbrella group, the National 
Democratic 
Campaign, Wednesday cancelled a big rally at the Lagos home of 
Moshood Abiola, the unofficial winner of presidential elections 
held last year. The campaign wanted to forestall a breakdown of 
law and order that could jeopardize its objective of having 
Abacha's military regime stand down and hand over power to 
Abiola, a spokesman for the group said. 
  The number two official in the junta, General Oladipo Diya, 
said the government was determined to continue with a phased 
return to democracy, with the first element, a constitutional 
conference, due to open June 27. This is intended to show the 
opposition that the government is a "responsible military 
administration," Diya told state-run radio. 
  However Nigerian security forces earlier in the day arrested 
four leaders of the opposition National Democratic Coalition, 
press reports said. 
  In a communique, the British High Commission, or embassy, in 
Lagos said it "regrets the recent arrests of a number of 
prominent politicians and hopes they will soon be released." 
The declaration, which diplomats said reflected the joint 
position of the European Union, said Britain and its partners 
were studying trade sanctions they took after the annulment of 
the elections last year and the military coup last November. 
  "These are being kept under close review and will be 
modified 
in the light of progress towards the establishments of 
democratic civilian rule," the statement said. 
  The detainees were a former information minister, Anthony 
Enahoro, and three former civilian state governors, Christian 
Onoh of Anambra in the southeast and Yahaya Abdulkarim and 
Balarabe Musa of Sokoto and Kaduna in the north. 
  Four members of the disbanded Senate, including speaker Ameh 
Ebute, and another former civilian governor, Segun Osoba, had 
been arrested previously. 
  The opposition coalition and members of the dissolved 
Nigerian parliament, issued separate statements declaring 
Abacha's six-month- old government illegal and called for a 
government of national union to be set up under Abiola. 
  Abiola has meanwhile written to US Vice President Al Gore 
asking the United States and other countries to recognise a 
parallel Nigerian government he said he intends to name by 
Sunday, the first anniversary of the annuled poll. The 
millionaire businessman told a crowd of supporters of his 
intention and challenged the military to arrest him. 
  "I will be sworn in as the president and commander-in-chief 
by the popular wish of the Nigerian people by the first 
anniversary of the election (June 12), and then let heavens 
fall," he said to a thundering ovation. 
  The crowd included ambassadors and representatives of 25 
countries, reporters said.

  [Text] Britain yesterday denied newspaper reports that it 
had condemned the arrest of the former Senate president, Mr. 
Ameh Ebute. The statement by the British High Commission in 
Lagos said that the government was aware of press reports over 
the weekend that it described the arrest of Mr. Ebute as [words 
indistinct] and that this was broadcast by the BBC. 
  Denying the reports the high commission said (?it had made 
no 
such condemnation). It, however, said that the British 
Government regretted the recent arrests of some prominent 
politicians and hoped that they would soon be released. The 
commission said the British Government was putting under close 
review measures taken against Nigeria after the annulment of the 
12 June elections. It gave the assurance that they would be 
modified if progress were made toward the establishment of 
democratic rule. The British Government called for constructive 
political dialogue in Nigeria as well as restraint from actions 
likely to impede the (?program) of the constitutional [word

  [Text] Nigerian elites and members of the political class 
have been cautioned against the temptation of using force to 
take over power from the military. The Senate president in the 
Second Republic and a member of the National Constitutional 
Conference Commission, Dr. Joseph Wayas, gave the warning at a 
news briefing in Abuja today. 
  Dr. Wayas drew the attention of politicians to the fact that 
even the military, who were forced out of their posts by their 
colleagues, have refrained from using force to insist on 
returning to power. He stressed the belief that the crisis 
surrounding 12 June which the country was currently facing was 
created and promoted by those who think Nigeria could not 
survive unless they were in power. 
  Dr. Wayas stressed the need for those he called campaigners 
of disorder to reflect on the fortitude, forebearance, and sense 
of responsibility displayed by media political actors who came 
before them. He condemned the recent statement credited to the 
president of the defunct Senate, Mr. Ameh Ebute, in which he 
declared the Provisional Ruling Council and the government as 
illegal. 
  The former Senate president, who noted that the Senate of 
the 
ill-fated Third Republic had no legal standing, wondered why 
those who participated in illegality should speak of the 
illegality of any administration.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The Nigerian military government of General Sani 
Abacha keeps tightening the screw another turn on the 
pro-democrat opposition. They say there is no way they can 
resign and revert the result of last June's election and the 
presumed winner, Moshood Abiola, seems bent on setting up an 
alternative government on the anniversary next Sunday [12 June]. 
There has been a wave of arrests of leading politicians, 
including former senators and members of the National Democratic 
Coalition, NADECO and the clampdown has continued. From Lagos, 
Sola Odunfa reports: 
  [Begin Odunfa recording] At least, five leading members of 
the National Democratic Coalition, NADECO, were arrested 
yesterday as the police launched a massive clampdown on 
pro-democracy activists nationwide. Those arrested were Chief 
Anthony Enahoro, veteran nationalist and leader of NADECO, who 
was picked from his home in Benin; former civilian governors 
Chief Christian Onoh of Anambra State, picked up in Enugu; 
Alhaji Balarabe Musa of Kaduna State, picked in Kaduna; Alhaji 
Yahaya Abdulkadir of Sokoto State, picked up at Lagos Airport; 
and Air Commodore David Jang, retired, who was arrested in his 
home near Jos. 
  Simultaneously, other teams of policemen raided the homes of 
other politicians in Oshun and Oyo States in Western Nigeria but 
the politicians had gone into hiding. The arrests have come in 
the wake of increasing defiance of the military government by 
the politicians who are insisting on the immediate restoration 
of full democracy, through the formal installation of the winner 
of last year's presidential election, Chief Moshood Abiola. 
  Reports today say that members of the dissolved Ondo State 
legislature met secretly yesterday in Akure and resolved to 
formally reconvene the House in open defiance of the military. 
Legislators in Katsina and Kano States in Northern Nigeria, and 
those in Oyo in the west are reported to be planning similar 
meetings. The man at the center of it all, Chief Abiola, is 
daring the military government to arrest him. Addressing a 
public lecture in Lagos last night, Chief Abiola said that he 
was ready to sacrifice his life in the struggle to make his 
victory at last year's election a reality. 
  However, the military government is unyielding. The vice 
chairman of the Provisional Ruling Council, Lieutenant General 
Oladipo Diya, told a gathering of traditional rulers in Eastern 
Nigeria yesterday that installing Chief Abiola as president 
would create a new set of problems which he did not specify. 
  The head of the Anglican Church in Nigeria, Archbishop 
Abiodun Adetiluye, has condemned the current spate of arrests. 
He says it will only aggravate tension and cause Nigerians to 
dislike the military the more. In an open letter to the head of 
state, Gen. Sani Abacha, the primate said, my dear general, now 
is the time to go. I appeal to you in the name of God, please 
listen to the voice of reason and go. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] As Nigerians watch the unfolding political events in 
the country between the military government of General Sani 
Abacha and prodemocracy activists, the newspapers report efforts 
by both parties to achieve one result or the other. 
  THE GUARDIAN, in a major headline writes: "Diya Seeks 
Dialogue on Crisis." The paper reports that the Federal 
Government has not sued for dialogue as a viable means of 
resolving the political crisis in Nigeria in which prodemocracy 
activists want the military regime to hand over power to 
civilians based on the annulled 12 June presidential election 
results of 1993. THE GUARDIAN observes that the new approach by 
government became visible following the meetings Nigeria's chief 
of general staff Lieutenant General Diya had with traditional 
rulers in the eastern and western regions of the country. 
  The SUNRAY reporting in the same vein has it that foreign 
nationals in Nigeria are becoming jittery because of tension 
created by M.K.O. Abiola and the National Democratic Coalition 
to form a parallel government in the country. 
  The SKETCH on its part reports that the former governor of 
Anambra State, Chief C.C. Onoh, arrested by security agents in 
connection with the political situation in the country, has been 
released. It said the former governor regained his freedom 
yesterday Wednesday and that he refuted all allegations against 
him. The paper also reflects on the airport interview Chief Onoh 
granted journalists at the Enugu Airport in which he urged 
Nigerians to allow peace to reign in order to find a lasting 
solution to the country's problems. 
  While the TRIBUNE reports that Chief Anthony Enahoro, a 
former minister in the First Republic, and Chief Bola Ige, 
former governor of Oyo State, have regained their freedom, it 
reports the arrest of other politicians but the paper failed to 
say who they were. It says their release was [words indistinct] 
the intervention of the minister of justice, Dr. Olu Onagoruwa. 
However, THE GUARDIAN reports that Chief Bola Ige was still 
being detained. Both papers may have published at different 
times. It however reports that 23 former civilian governors out 
of 30 of them who served during the last military regime in 
Nigeria have called for a dialogue among the different interest 
groups in the country to resolve the political stalemate without 
resorting to war. 
  The CHAMPION, reasoning in the same way, reports that the 
ex- 
governors felt that this step will help reduce tension. The 
DAILY TIMES echoing in the same angle reports that other 
prominent Africans like Dr. Akinola Aguda, a former director 
general of the Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies and 
Dr. Mole Nkose, director, South African Institute of Economic 
Policy, have joined others to appeal to all the contending 
groups to use dialogue to handle the political situation in 
Nigeria. The TIMES also reports this by stressing that 
Nigeria's chief of general staff, Lt. Gen. Diya, has appealed to 
Nigerians to give the Abacha regime a chance to prove its 
sincerity.

  [Text] The chief of general staff, Lieutenant General 
Oladipo Diya, has called for the support of Nigerians toward the 
ongoing democratization program. Gen. Diya made the call in 
Benin while speaking at a meeting with traditional rulers and 
elders from Edo and Delta States. He expressed concern at some 
media organizations which have been feeding the public with 
false information about the arrest of some eminent Nigerians. 
  Gen. Diya said only the inspector general of police is 
authorized to arrest people who have committed offenses, and 
such people will be made to face the proper charges. He stated 
that the present administration is committed to the rule of law 
and assured that those who have been arrested without concrete 
charges will eventually be released. 
  The chief of general staff also spoke of attempts to spoil 
the name of the traditional rulers. He warned that those 
engaged in spreading rumors to cause confusion will be made to 
face the law.

  [Text] The military authorities in Nigeria have again 
assured the people that they have no hidden agenda to perpetuate 
themselves in office. Rather, they said, their ardent desire 
was to return the country to a democratic rule in the shortest 
time possible. This assurance was given by Lieutenant General 
Oladipo Diya, the chief of general staff, at a meeting in Lagos 
last night with traditional rulers and leaders from the western 
part of the country. Explaining that the meeting was to brief 
the traditional rulers and leaders of thought on the current 
political situation in the country to allow them to judge for 
themselves, Gen. Diya said the situation did not call for them 
to fold their arms and wait for government to slug it out with 
its detractors -- the so-called democracy groups. Gen. Diya 
said the government would continue to talk with the reasonable 
ones among the agitators, but would ignore the radical ones 
within the groups. The chief of general staff repeated his 
condemnation of certain people, whom he accused of mobilizing 
some news media to publish things that would not advance the 
cause of peace and unity in the country. 
  Earlier yesterday, Gen. Diya had addressed a similar meeting 
of traditional rulers from Edo and Delta states in Benin. The 
general had told the traditional rulers that the planned 
constitutional conference remained the only platform left for 
Nigerians to articulate their different political interests. He 
discounted a newspaper report alleging that the government had 
given 10 million naira to some traditional rulers and stated 
that the present administration had never and would never sell 
anybody.

efforts to facilitate the return of peace to that country. The 
director of Defense Information, Brigadier General Fred Chijuka, 
stated this today in Lagos. He said that the mobilization was 
already in progress in accordance with a Federal Government 
directive. Brig. Gen. Chijuka explained that the Nigerian

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] [passage indistinct] the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] intends to rule in Huambo 
and it officially stated its intention to the mediator today. 
This morning the mediator, the observers, and government and 
UNITA representatives met at the Mulungushi Conference Center to 
discuss swearing in UNITA members of parliament. Although the 
outcome of the talks is not yet satisfactory, reliable sources 
have just told us that the government and UNITA are trying to 
find a solution to that and other issues. So, it is still 
believed that an agreement may be reached in Lusaka because 
there are no obstacles that cannot be overcome. 
  Meanwhile, UNITA spokesman Jorge Valentim this morning 
summoned Angolan and foreign newsmen to inform them about 
UNITA's official position regarding its participation in 
governing the country. Angolan journalists insisted that 
Valentim confirm or deny his statements to the TIMES OF ZAMBIA 
that UNITA would continue to demand that the government allocate 
it the Foreign and Interior Ministries. Valentim simply said, 
quote, I have no comments. I can just say that UNITA wants to 
govern Huambo and this position has already been officially 
presented to the mediators, unquote. Meanwhile, it has been 
reported that the government and UNITA will this afternoon 
continue the discussions to find solutions on the issue being 
discussed and come up with an agreement that would conform with 
the interests of the negotiators. Everything now depends on the 
goodwill of both sides.

  [Text] Relative calm prevailed in the city of Kuito this 
morning. UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola] rebels have scaled down their shelling and attacks 
against the martyred city. 
  Right now, sporadic shelling is in progress. Snipers 
continue to shoot at everything. Reliable military sources with 
the Bie Provincial Operational Command said this morning's 
relative calm was due to rebel forces making arrangements for a 
new attack on the city of Kuito over the next few hours. 
  Meanwhile, famine is beginning to reach alarming 
proportions. 
The World Food Program, Caritas [International Conference of 
Catholic Organizations for Charitable and Social Action], and 
the International Red Cross have already distributed their food 
stocks to the residents. Although snipers control Kuito's 
streets, the residents have left their hideouts in search of 
food. 
  In Malanje, government forces have extended their defensive 
areas. Units of the Angolan Armed Forces, National Police, and 
Civil Defense are heading to the west of Cambondo, 19 km from 
the city of Malanje. UNITA soldiers have suffered heavy losses. 
In a press release issued today, the Northeastern Front Command 
says combined government forces this morning repelled a group of 
the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola intending to 
attack (Tocamba) locality. In their hasty retreat, UNITA rebels 
abandoned four AKM clips, 209 rounds of ammunition, seven M-69 
hand grenades, and one knapsack. UNITA used long-range weapons 
in its attack, though no losses were reported.

  [Text] UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola] rebel troops this afternoon resumed shelling of the 
besieged city of Kuito. Throughout the day, snipers continued 
to fire at the residents looking for food, water, and firewood 
following a lull in the shelling. A source with the Bie 
Operational Command has described UNITA's suspension of shelling 
and its resumption in the afternoon as a maneuver that fits 
within the framework of preparations planned for the next few 
hours. The source added that today there were countless 
movements by UNITA troops, while long-range artillery fired at 
various parts of the city of Kuito. UNITA troops used vehicles 
confiscated from humanitarian agencies during the evacuation of 
relief workers. 
  The food situation is worsening. Five people have already 
starved to death in the past 72 hours. The figure is likely to 
increase unless the situation is remedied. 
  In Malanje, Jonas Savimbi's men today suffered human and 
material losses when they clashed with government troops in the 
outlaying areas of that city. Sources with the Northwestern 
Military Command revealed that at 1315 [1215 GMT] today, a clash 
took place in Corta Lenha locality, some 16 km east of the city 
of Malanje. Government forces killed 11 rebels, and captured 
(?six) AKM's, three PKM machine guns, eight 81-mm, 82-mm, and 
60-mm mortar grenades, 14 B-12 gun shells, two radio antennas, 
and kitchen equipment. The sources regretted to announced the 
death of an officer. Two soldiers were slightly wounded. 
  General Agostinho Fernandes, commander of the Northwestern 
Military Command, today paid a visit to combatants stationed 14 
km east of Malanje. Recently, the combatants inflicted heavy 
losses on the enemy.

<F P=106> [Article by Orlando Muchanga] </F>
  [Text] (Milange) Gimo Phiri, leader of Udemo [Mozambique 
Democratic Union] is still making threats, saying that if he 
does not receive the same conditions as those granted to 
Dhlakama and Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] in Maputo, 
he and his personnel will launch attacks. 
  Jose Francisco Goncalves, head of the Organization and 
Mobilization Department, who once again contacted us in Milange, 
reiterated that they want money for Udemo, otherwise they will 
attack government and Renamo military positions. They are 
awaiting a reply from the president of the republic. 
  We tried to contact Phiri in Milange, and we were told that 
the meeting could only take place on the Namuli mountain. 
  Out of the 2,000 Udemo soldiers said to be confined with 
government soldiers, we saw only 500 in the Milange assembly 
area. 
  We learned that FAM [Mozambique Armed Forces] soldiers born 
in that region are not awaiting orders for the official 
demobilization. Many have already gone home. 
  Goncalves added that "we have been meeting along the way" 
with MYP [Malawi Young Pioneers] members from bases located in 
Malawi's Thyolo District, mixed with Renamo personnel. 
  He alleged that these are Young Pioneers, which Renamo calls 
Rombezia [Rovuma-Zambezia separatist movement] Movement, located 
in Zambezia Province's Lugela District. Goncalves says: 
"Rombezia existed and disappeared in the 70s." He said, "We 
have also requested Mr. Dhlakama to withdraw his men, who for 
two months have been moving in our area in Namuli." 
  Colonel Elias Dhlakama, based in the Renamo assembly area in 
Sabelua, has categorically refuted the existence of MYP elements 
in his movement's bases. On the emergence of Rombezia, he said: 
"There might be something." 
  He said: "These bandits can only be the creation of Frelimo 
[Mozambique Liberation Front], such as Naparama [Government- 
sponsored counterinsurgency unit] and Phiri's men. They have 
always bet on people bent on destroying Renamo." 
  The civilian sources we contacted in Milange said they have 
not detected area any movement of the so-called Rombezia in the 
area. On this issue they only know what the press has been 
reporting.

  [Excerpt] The residents of Zambezia Province's central 
Mocuba District have reinstated order following a wave of 
violence caused by government soldiers confined in the capital 
of the district. This happened on 6 June when the former 
soldiers mutinied and abandoned the assembly area, demanding an 
immediate demobilization and a speedy return to their homes. 
The police failed to control the situation, much less the UN 
personnel stationed in the area. The mutineers inundated the 
city, blocking the main road and exit of Mocuba both in the 
north and south. They destroyed a private vehicle, burned three 
houses, and disrupted the central market, causing considerable 
losses to the vendors. The wave of violence did not last more 
than an hour, because the population, seeing that the security 
forces were unable to contain the disturbances, organized itself 
and wielding hatchets and sticks, responded in kind. One 
soldier was killed and others seriously wounded, according to 
official reports. Meanwhile, unofficial reports say that two 
soldiers died and dozens others were wounded. In less than an 
hour the situation was under control and life returned to 
normal. Our reporters visited Mocuba 24 hours after the incident 
and the atmosphere was good. It was as if nothing abnormal had 
happened. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Organization of African Unity, OAU, could now 
brace itself to fulfill its financial obligations following the 
closure of its heavy commitment in the struggle against 
apartheid in South Africa and the imminent dissolution of the 
OAU special fund for the liberation of Africa. 
  Addressing the 60th ordinary session of the OAU Council of 
Ministers in Tunis yesterday, the honorable minister of foreign 
affairs, Mr. Molapo Qhobela, said he hoped that the member 
states would now be in a position to concentrate better on their 
financial obligations to the regular budget of the OAU. Mr. 
Qhobela welcomed South Africa, which was formally admitted as 
the 53rd member of the OAU at the Council of Ministers' meeting. 
One of the main battles of the OAU for decades, since its 
founding in 1963, was to dismantle apartheid. 
  The minister said the admission of South Africa, whose 
tenacious struggle for freedom and democracy commanded universal 
recognition, brought a particular kind of joy to Lesotho, which 
is South Africa's closest neighbor. Commenting on the report of 
the OAU secretary general, Dr. Salim Achmed Salim, on the 
organization's activities since the last summit of heads of 
state and government in Cairo last year, Mr. Qhobela said 
commendable progress had been made by the organization over the 
past year. In particular, the minister applauded the work 
achieved in the areas of management, of peaceful transitional to 
democratic rule, economic integration, as well as work on 
conflict resolution among African countries. 
  Mr. Qhobela recalled with gratitude the contribution made by 
the OAU towards resolving, through peaceful means, the crisis 
situation that resulted from the confrontation between the two 
warring factions in the Lesotho armed forces earlier this year.

  [Text] Cape Town June 8 SAPA -- The Frontline States are to 
send a task force to Lesotho to quote "knock some sense" into 
the elements disrupting the country, Frontline Chairman and 
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said on Wednesday. 
  Speaking at a late night press conference attended by 
President Nelson Mandela, Namibian head of state Sam Nujoma and 
President Ali Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania, he said the task force 
would try to interact with those who were disturbing democracy 
in the mountain kingdom. 
  It would also warn them that if they persisted in their 
actions, the Frontline States would "go further than just the 
political act of sending a task force". Military action was 
"not excluded but for now it has not been decided on". 
  Mr Mandela said the Frontline States had no desire to engage 
in any action offensive to the international and regional 
organisations whose opinions it valued. "We must understand 
this as an attempt to preserve democracy within the parameters 
of consultation with all parties that are involved. We are 
committed to methods of peaceful persuasion in addressing 
problems generally and in particular with regard to Lesotho." 
  President Mugabe said the task force had already met and 
would leave as soon as its members had "put their thoughts 
together" under the terms of reference given to them. They 
would report back as soon as possible. 
  Whatever action was finally taken would be on a joint basis 
and would not be just the action of an individual Frontline 
country. 
  President Mugabe said he and his Frontline colleagues on 
Wednesday discussed a report compiled by a task force appointed 
earlier this year on the situation in Lesotho and felt "very, 
very disturbed". The situation there was deteriorating by the 
day and the government was unable to perform its functions 
freely because of interference by elements in both the army and 
the police force. 
  "In view of that worsening situation, we have decided that 
we 
will certainly set up another task force which will go back to 
Lesotho and try to knock some sense into those elements of the 
forces, whether it is police or army who are interfering with 
the smooth running of governmental activity and actually causing 
the lawlessness currently taking place in that country." He 
regarded this as "stern action". 
  The task force would "enjoin them, urge them, encourage them 
and actually warn them that if they persist in their actions, we 
will go further than just the political act of sending a task 
force. "We would set a very dangerous precedent if, in a region 
where democracy is the order of the day, and where it is not the 
order of the day, is being established...we allowed its reversal 
by forces which are bent on lawlessness, and disorder." 
  President Mugabe said the first task force which represented 
only Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa, had made 
recommendations to Lesotho, including restructuring of the army 
to incorporate guerrillas from the Lesotho Liberation Army. 
However, sections of the army had prevented the government from 
implementing the reforms. 
  Representatives of Botswana, Lesotho and Zambia were also 
present at the press conference.

  [Text] Cape Town June 9 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela 
held discussions on what he called "matters of common interest" 
with Namibian President Sam Nujoma at his Westbrooke residence 
in Cape Town on Thursday morning. The meeting is the first of a 
series of four meetings with Frontline leaders scheduled for 
Thursday morning. 
  Mr Mandela said after the meeting that he had exchanged 
views 
with Mr Nujoma on several issues including proposed Frontline 
action on the crisis in Lesotho. 
  Mr Nujoma said he and Mr Mandela had discussed "bilateral 
issues". "We have much in common particularly in terms of 
trade. Over 70 percent of Namibia's trade is with South Africa 
so we are good neighbours... We wanted to promote that." 
  He said he and Mr Mandela also discussed the situations in 
Angola, Mozambique and Rwanda. "These are issues of great 
concern to all of us. We want peace and stability because one 
cannot have development where there is no peace." 
  Mr Mandela also posed briefly for photographs with 
Zimbabwean 
President Robert Mugabe with whom he has just begun a meeting. 
  He is also due to meet President Ali Hassan Mwinyi of 
Tanzania and Joachim Chissano of Mozambique. All five heads of 
state will be attending a southern African economic summit in 
Cape Town on Thursday afternoon.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The peace process in Liberia seems, for all intents 
and purposes, to have been on the back burner for weeks now. 
Disarmament of the warring factions has come to a halt and 
clashes have continued. The peacekeeping forces had its hands 
tied to intervene but the last thing the ruling council wants is 
for the factions to continue to carry weapons a second longer 
than necessary. So Charles Taylor's suggestion two weeks ago 
that a transitional army should be set up with his NPFL 
[National Patriotic Front of Liberia] providing half the force, 
did not go down too well with the council. From Monrovia, Nii 
Nartey Allison telexed this report. 
  Liberia's ruling council today rejected demands by NPFL 
leader Charles Taylor for the formation of a transitional army. 
State Council chairman David Kpomakpor said the council was 
adamantly opposed to such a proposal. Addressing his first 
meeting with reporters since assuming office in March, Kpomakpor 
said it is counterproductive and we don't consider the issue 
debatable. He went on to say while we were trying without 
success to take away guns from the various armed factions, he 
had proposed that we form another army with these same men and 
return their guns to them. This is wrong. Kpomakpor also called 
for a fresh meeting of the parties to the Cotonou Agreement to 
review the Liberian peace process and he threatened to resort to 
action if this proposal was not met. He blamed the slow pace of 
the peace process on a lack of will from the warring factions 
and said the situation rather than becoming better was, in fact, 
getting worse. 
  Kpomakpor said the council is worried by pressure from the 
United States Government that as of the end of this month, if 30 
to 50 percent of the arms have not been taken away from the 
warring factions, it would reconsider its position on Liberia 
but he did not elaborate. Kpomakpor said the United States has 
turned down requests to give recongnition to the transitional 
government because the government itself lacks control over the 
entire country.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] The government and UNITA [National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola] negotiating teams are still 
discussing the swearing in of UNITA members of parliament. The 
government has submitted a new document on this issue. Today's 
session was only between the negotiators. The mediator was not 
present. The negotiators failed to reach an agreement, but a 
meeting of heads of negotiating teams is scheduled for tomorrow. 
  Meanwhile, UNITA today reacted to the government proposal on 
the organization's participation in the governing of Angola. 
UNITA's response was presented to Alioune Blondin Beye, UN 
special representative in Angola and is already in the 
government delegation's hands. 
  Also today, UNITA issued an official statement in Lusaka, 
saying it fully accepts the government's proposal on 
participation in government. In terms of national 
reconciliation, the government has offered the following posts 
to UNITA: four ministries, seven deputy ministries, three 
provincial governments, seven deputy provincial governments, 30 
municipality administrations, 35 deputy municipality 
administrations, 75 communal administrations, and six diplomatic 
missions. In the statement read by Information Secretary Jorge 
Valentim, UNITA says it accepts all that, but asks the 
government to include the government of Huambo Province. 
  The government has not yet reacted officially, but confirmed 
it has received UNITA's response demanding Huambo province's 
government and the legitimization of districts occupied by the 
force of arms. 
  [Luanda Radio Nacional in Portuguese at 1900 GMT on 8 June 
broadcasts a similar report saying "the statement released by 
UNITA in Lusaka this afternoon does not reflect the reality. A 
source close to the talks says UNITA has accepted the overall 
number but not the localities proposed by the government. The 
source gave the example of municipal and communal 
administrations, as well as diplomatic missions. The source 
said UNITA only wants to impress the international public 
opinion. In practice the organization wants to force the 
government to legitimize the areas it occupies militarily."]

  [Excerpts] Tunis, 7 June, JANA -- Brother 'Umar 
al-Muntasir, secretary of the General People's Committee for 
Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation, congratulated the 
chairman and members of the bureau [as received] of the 60th 
session of the OAU Council of Foreign Ministers which started in 
Tunis. He also hoped for a better political and economic future 
for Africa. He added: I would like to express my gratitude and 
appreciation to all the states of the African continent and to 
the OAU and its secretary-general for their supportive stands 
toward the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah, which 
never ceased offering initiatives to find a peaceful solution to 
the dispute known now as the Lockerbie crisis. This African 
support constituted -- with the support we received from other 
major regional organizations -- a general position which 
reflected the will of the majority of the international 
community and which should be acknowledged and taken into 
account. [passage omitted] 
  The brother secretary went on to say: We remind the African 
states of the importance of taking urgent measures to confront 
the attempts aimed at interfering in the African affairs, 
usurping the freedom and independence of the peoples, plundering 
their resources and obstructing the development process they 
chose for themselves. This forces us to coordinate and consult 
one another to adopt a united stand in order to confront these 
challenges which threaten the security, safety and sovereignty 
of the states of the (African) continent. 
  The brother secretary also said: The OAU dealt with the 
Libyan-Chadian border dispute for several years during which the 
two countries cooperated with the organization and the ad hoc 
committee and this kept the matter within the framework of the 
African continent. [passage omitted] [item ends in mid- 
transmission] 
  [Tripoli Libyan Television Network in Arabic at 1930 GMT on 
7 
June, in a related report adds: 
  ["Consequently, the two countries [Libya and Chad] managed 
to 
solve the dispute with their mutual consent; and proceeding from 
the spirit of African fraternity and the relation of good 
neighborliness, the Great Jamahiriyah and the sister republic of 
Chad agreed to end their territorial dispute after the Great 
Jamahiriyah complied with the ruling passed by the International 
Court of Justice. 
  ["He added: Within the framework of its respect for the 
international charters which it has never ceased to take into 
account in its international relations, the Great Jamahiriyah 
signed an agreement with the republic of Chad to implement the 
ruling since it recognized that this ruling had decided the fate 
of a region which was the subject of a dispute between two 
neighboring sister countries. Practical measures started to be 
taken to implement the ruling in accordance with the agreed 
timetable and in an atmosphere of understanding and full 
cooperation and under the supervision of UN monitors. This 
agreement was crowned yesterday with the signing of a treaty of 
good neighborliness and cooperation during the Chadian 
president's visit to the Great Jamahiriyah."]

<F P=106> [Report from Lusaka by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao] </F>
  [Text] The negotiators at the peace talks here in Lusaka 
woke up very early today. No one was on bed by 0600. There was 
intense movement at mediator Alioune Blondin Beye's hotel room. 
First, Alioune Blondin Beye received the leadership of the 
government negotiating team, which included General Kopelipa, 
special envoy of President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos 
Santos. Gen. Kopelipa arrived here in Lusaka last evening. 
  Then, Alioune Blondin Beye received the leadership of the 
negotiating team of the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA]. No one knows what was discussed 
during these meetings. 
  Then the negotiating teams from the government and UNITA 
went 
to the conference hall to discuss alone the document on swearing 
in UNITA members of parliament. The government presented UNITA 
a new document containing all guarantees. UNITA says it wants 
to study the document. All that is known is that the parties 
are near to reaching an agreement. 
  Meanwhile, yesterday, UNITA made an official statement 
saying 
that it accepts the government offer on its participation in 
different levels of government. The government agrees that it 
received UNITA's document, but the only thing is that it was 
astonished when it opened the envelope. UNITA says it accepts 
but it has changed all the government's proposals at the level 
of district governments. It wants to legally possess the 
districts it occupied illegally. It wants Soyo and Canfunfo. 
The government says there is time for jokes. Its offer is not 
negotiable. Either UNITA should say yes to the government offer 
without amendments or it says no.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] Here in Lusaka this morning the special envoy of 
President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos held a meeting 
with the mediator of the Angolan peace process. General 
Kopelipa, special envoy of Angolan head of state Engineer Jose 
Eduardo dos Santos, arrived here in Lusaka, Zambia, yesterday 
evening and this morning held a meeting with Alioune Blondin 
Beye, mediator in the Angolan peace process. The meeting was 
attended by the government delegation leadership, by Dr. 
Fernando Faustino Muteka and General Eugenio Carneiro. 
  Although no details have been given about the meeting, it is 
believed that Gen. Kopelipa conveyed to Alioune Blondin Beye a 
verbal message from the president of the republic concerning the 
talks between the government and the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] under way here in Lusaka. 
  Meanwhile, an official source told Angola Radio Nacional 
that 
the document presented by UNITA representatives to the mediator 
yesterday, connected with that organization's participation in 
the country's government, is void. It is therefore necessary 
and urgent that UNITA declares unambiguously whether or not it 
fully accepts the latest offer made by the government, which is 
not in any way negotiable. 
  The source also said that the government will, as always, 
continue committed to searching solutions that will lead to 
peace through negotiations, fighting to preserve unity and 
national reconciliation, and trying to resolve the multifaceted 
problems which the Angolan people still experience, because of 
the war mounted by Jonas Savimbi's UNITA. The source, contacted 
by the Angola Radio Nacional here in Lusaka, stressed that the 
government is aware of its responsibilities and cannot therefore 
be blamed for the lack of free movement of people and goods in 
different corners of the national territory. As a matter of 
fact, the source added, the entire Angolan people long ago 
identified the causes of their suffering and who is behind them. 
  This morning the negotiators from the government and UNITA 
continued to discuss the issue which has been on the negotiating 
table for the past eight days. It deals with swearing in some 
UNITA members of parliament. On this issue the understanding 
between the negotiators from the government and UNITA is proving 
to be difficult. Sources close to the talks believe, however, 
that the parties could reach an agreement any time, thus making 
it possible to discuss other issues connected with national 
reconciliation in the working agenda. It is already known 
however that UNITA has requested more time to reflect on the 
issue, as has always been the case.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the FAA General Staff in Luanda on 9 </F>
June] 
  [Text] The causes behind the unfortunate incident which 
involved an Angolan Air Force fighter aircraft in Waku Kungo at 
1220 on 6 June have been investigated. The conclusion follows: 
  The aircraft's mission was to carry out actions to support 
our land forces on the outskirts of Waku Kungo, a distance of 40 
to 50 kms. The aircraft showed a misreading in its course 
indicator. This, added to the existence of thick fog in the area 
experienced during this time of the year, hindered visual 
observation. Thus, the pilot carried out maneuvers taking the 
aircraft to the District of Waku Kungo. 
  Thinking that he was above his specific target, the pilot 
carried out the stipulated actions, hitting a school in the 
district. As a result of this involuntary incident, we lament 
the death of 89 pupils and the destruction of the school. 
  The General Staff of the Angolan Armed Forces [FAA] deepely 
regrets this very serious incident. It would like once again to 
present to the bereaved families its deepest condolences and 
promises to do everything in its power to minimize the damage 
caused. 
  [Issued] Office of the Chief of the FAA's General Staff, 
Luanda, 9 June 1994. 
  [Signed] Army General Joao Baptista de Matos, chief of the 
FAA General Staff.

  [Text] War continues in Kuito, Bie Province. Fifteen days

the past days, government troops have made many prisoners among 
Jonas Savimbi's men and captured a quantity of war materiel. 
Our correspondent Abel Abraao has further details. 
  [Begin recording] [Abraao] The atmosphere is still 
characterized by war here in Kuito. The Black Cockerel's men 
continue to attack the martyred city of Kuito. After 15 days of 
fierce clashes and heavy shellings, government forces killed 
[words indistinct] Jonas Savimbi's men and captured 42 AKM's, 
six [words indistinct], three RPG-7's, one M-79's, [words 
indistinct], 15 hand grenades, a quantity of rounds of 
ammunition, 25 clips, (?two) missiles, and two machineguns. 
Government forces also destroyed one vehicle. Brigadier 
Simeone Mukume, second commander of the FAA Operational Command 
in Bie, told our reporter that the political and military 
situation is worrying in the city of Kuito at the present moment. 
  [Mukume] The situation is worrying because forces belonging 
to the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
[UNITA] continue to move men from the neighboring Province of 
Huambo, as well as war materiel from Cuando Cubango. 
  [Abraao] At this moment, the situation is worrying, but it 
is under the control of government forces. [end recording]

  [Text] War continues in the city of Kuito in Bie Province. 
The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] 
has resumed shelling the city, hitting defenseless people. Our 
correspondent Abel Abraao has further details. 
  [Begin Abraao recording] UNITA resumed shelling the city of 
Kuito yesterday afternoon, after a break in the morning. The 
shelling has continued until now, wounding nine civilians -- 
four in Cunje commune -- and killing five others. Despite the 
apparent reduction in actions by the Black Cockerel's troops 
over the past 24 hours, the military situation in Kuito has not 
changed in any way. It is believed that this atmosphere is due 
to the losses suffered by UNITA troops over the past 15 days. 
This is the assessment made by Simeone Mukume, second commander 
of the operational command of the government forces in Bie. 
Brig. Mukume said silencing guns only depends on UNITA. When 
the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola halts their 
attacks, the war will end. [end recording]

  [Text] Huambo residents are still victims of the excessive 
ambition of the leading class of the Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola-Labor Party, which orders the bombing of 
the city everyday. On 8 June at least 12 napalm and incendiary 
bombs were dropped on Huambo, killing 16 people and wounding 35, 
including women, children, and old people. A communique issued 
by the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola General Staff, 
signed by General Arlindo Chenda Pena Ben-Ben, during the 8 June 
air raid, reports that 23 people were burned. The killings were 
executed by Su aircraft coming from the Catumbela Air Base.

  [Text] About 20 people have been injured by gunfire in 
Djibouti when police dispersed a demonstration against the 
bulldozing of homes in an Afar district of Djibouti's capital. 
Afar sources and the United Front of the Djibouti Opposition 
said four people were killed during Sunday's [5th June] protest 
in the Ahabia District of Djibouti. The opposition front also 
claimed that security forces arrested more than 300 people 
including the front's president, Muhammad Ahmad Issa known as 
(Chiko). 
  The incident was seen as the latest in a conflict between 
Djibouti's Afars, and the authorities and security forces 
dominated by Issas, the main ethnic group in Djibouti. The 
Association for Human Rights and Freedom quoted witnesses as 
saying that there were many demonstrators wounded. It said more 
than 300 people have been left homeless and dispossessed of 
anything which might be useful to them.

  [Text] An official spokesman of the 12 political 
organizations of the Somali Salvation Alliance [SSA] has said 
the conference which should have been held on 4 June by the 
country's 16 political organizations was delayed because the 
Somali National Alliance [SNA], which had agreed to take part, 
backed out. The official said the SNA's rejection was 
communicated to the SSA by Ambassador Lansana Kouyate, acting 
special UN envoy to Somalia, and that the UN Operation in 
Somalia [UNOSOM] should therefore clarify to the Somali people 
and the world who is responsible for the conference's delay. 
  The spokesman continued that the SSA members are ready to 
participate in the conference, as previously agreed, so as to do 
something about the existing problems in the country. The SSA 
spokesman also said that a delay in holding the conference could 
entail a bleak future for the Somali people. However the 12 
organizations are not ready be associated with those advocating 
the delay. The 12 organizations, he said, have always shown 
their readiness to contribute toward resolving the affairs of 
Somalia which have been unresolved for four years. In 
conclusion, the official reiterated how UNOSOM bears 
responsibility for pinpointing those causing the delay.

  [Text] President Yoweri Museveni has said there is now a 
basis for a cease-fire in Rwanda and again called on the Rwanda 
Patriotic Front [RPF] to accept the cease-fire and start 
implementing the Arusha accord aimed at ending the massacre in 
the Central African state. The Ugandan leader stated this in a 
speech broadcast live on Radio Uganda from (Kisawera) in Mukono 
District, where this year's Heroes Day was celebrated at the 
national level. He told an attentive audience that he feels 
there is now a basis for a cease- fire in Rwanda because of the 
Arusha Accord signed in the northern Tanzania town last year and 
the resolution passed by the United Nations Human Rights 
Commission recently condemning genocide in Rwanda. The 
resolution called for precaution for persecution of those found 
responsible. He said the Arusha Accord, which provides for the 
sharing of power, is a good basis. Maybe, he added, it now 
needs modification because (?some) of the people who would have 
taken part in power-sharing have been involved in genocide. On 
the UN Human Rights Commission's resolution condemning genocide, 
the president said genocide is not an internal issue and pledged 
that the Ugandan Government will (?call) on the United Nations 
to hand those responsible.

  [Excerpt] Today in the Isare Commune, Nyambuye Zone, of 
Bujumbura Rural Province, there was tension throughout the day; 
certain armed persons caused the area to be insecure. Some 
people who live in the area were about to flee to Bujumbura. 
This morning the governor of Bujumbura [not further identified] 
spoke about the events, and gave his reaction to them: 
  [Begin recording] [Governor] A group of soldiers based in 
Isare went to Nyambuye this morning to verify information they 
had been given by the district commander, concerning an armed 
gang there who were about to launch an attack. It became very 
tense upon their arrival. Some people shot at the soldiers. 
Ordinary people who were on their way to markets and to work 
returned home, while others fled the [words indistinct] zones in 
particular. In Mugongomanga Commune, at a place called Matara 
on Bubaji Hill, there was also a group of armed people, and they 
also continue to fire on people. The commander of Bujumbura 
Rural District has just informed us that one person has already 
died. So, there is insecurity in this area as well. In the 
coming days we will decide on what measures we will take to 
restore peace. It was reported that in the afternoon the 
tension continued, to the extent that a counsellor [not further 
identified] from the governor who was in the area, and who was 
accompanied by security personnel, had problems. He told us 
that those who were shooting had not yet been pacified. 
  [Counsellor] [passage omitted] I saw three dead people: Two 
men and a woman. I saw burning houses, and the zone offices 
were on fire, as well as other neighboring houses. While 
returning, in the company of the commander of Bujumbura rural 
district and some other people, we were shot at, but we 
survived. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Ndjamena, 9 Jun (AFP) -- Ndjamena Radio Nationale 
Tchadienne announced today that the Chadian Army "completely 
destroyed" a base of the rebel Movement for Democracy and 
Development [MDD] during a "tough battle" on a Lake Chad island. 
The state radio announced that "many" rebels were killed in the 
clashes which took place on Baikaram Seguir Island but did not 
give the date. 
  The radio also announced that President Idriss Deby went to 
the island yesterday to "inspect the state of health" of the 
wounded Chadian National Army [ANT] soldiers and "to boost their 
morale." However, the radio did not give the casualty figures on 
the government side. No casualty figures were given for the MDD 
either, which is a political and military movement operating in 
the Lake Chad region led by Brahim Mallah Mahamat. 
  The radio further stated that the MDD Baikaram base on 
Baikaram Island was recaptured by the ANT following a "tough 
battle which completely wiped out the rebels." It also reported 
that some rebels were taken prisoner, while others fled. 
  The radio disclosed that from their Baikaram base, "the 
rebels perpetrated so many crimes against peace-loving citizens 
that the government forces, the guarantors of the security of 
persons and goods, decided to put an end to their presence in 
the region." 
  Yesterday, Prime Minister Delwa Kassire Koumakoye visited 
those who were wounded in the clashes and were evacuated to 
Ndjamena Military Hospital. On leaving the hospital, he 
disclosed that the government would no longer allow the rebels 
to jeopardize national security. He said the Lake Chad incident 
should give other rebel movements operating in several other 
regions "food for thought." 
  The authorities have not reported any major clashes between 
the MDD forces and government troops for several months now. In 
August 1993, the MDD reported clashes with the ANT but Chadian 
Army officials denied those reports.

  [Text] Kigali, June 9 (AFP) -- Rwandan Army and rebel 
commanders adjourned truce talks Thursday [9 June] without 
reaching agreement but scheduled another round for Saturday, the 
United Nations said. 
  The UN official chairing the talks, Brigadier-General Henry 
Anyidoho of Ghana, said the two sides were working on a draft 
accord spelling out the terms of a ceasefire and that both 
delegations had proposed amendments. 
  The discussions at the United Nations headquarters at a 
Kigali hotel were held in a tense atmosphere, beginning shortly 
after a rocket-propelled grenade slammed into the building. 
  Anyidoho said the attack appeared to be deliberate. "It 
cannot have been an accident, it was a direct hit," he said. 
  A UN armoured personnel carrier bringing the army delegation 
to the talks narrowly escaped being hit by mortar fire as 
battles raged in several parts of Kigali. 
  Truce talks between General Marcel Gatsinzi of the army and 
Colonel Frank Mugambage of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front 
adjourned Wednesday after "very positive" exchanges, a UN 
spokesman said, though he added that "a lot of work is still to 
be done." 
  Thursday's session was the fourth of so far inconclusive 
negotiations between the two sides. 
  The talks resumed amid news of massacres of clergymen by 
both 
sides. The rebels admitted that "uncontrolled elements" had 
killed 13 priests including the archbishop of Kigali and two 
bishops last week in Kabgayi, 50 kilometres (30 miles) 
south-west of Kigali.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] In the war in Rwanda, a few hours 
apart, the announcements have come of two massacres targeting 
ecclesiastics: Seven priests were killed in the district of 
Nyamirambo in Kigali, along with several dozen civilians who had 
placed themselves under their protection. We return to this 
massacre in a few moments with the spokesman of the UNAMIR -- 
the United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda. The massacre 
was carried out in a government-controlled zone. 
  A few hours earlier the RPF [Rwandan Popular Front] radio 
station announced the killing of 13 ecclesiastics, carried out 
by members of the RPF. Among the victims were the archbishop of 
Kigali, the chairman of the Bishops' Conference, and the bishop 
of Byumba. Ghislaine Dupont: 
  [Dupont] Yes, according to the version supplied by the RPF, 
the 13 ecclesiastics had been placed under the protection of 
eight rebel soldiers after the fall of Kabgayi. Four of these 
bodyguards, apparently convinced that the priests took part in 
massacres of their families, decided to execute the 
ecclesiastics. When the bodies were discovered, the other 
bodyguards -- who thus are reported not to have taken part in 
the murder -- killed one of the rebel bodyguards. The other 
three are reported to have fled. The RPF radio says that the 
guards on the run are being hunted and when they are found they 
will be tried by a military tribunal. However, there is one 
unknown detail in this version -- the date of these killings has 
not been specified by the Front. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] The United Nations announced this morning that 
it 
had learned of another tragedy -- the murder of 7 ecclesiastics 
and 63 civilians in a district of Kigali, the district of 
Nyamirambo, considered to be the bastion of the Hutu militias. 
Christophe Boisbouvier asked UNAMIR Spokesman Major Plante what 
information he had: 
  [Begin Plante recording] Yes, we have very specific 
information from very reliable sources, which does indeed speak 
of killings, a massacre. [passage omitted] 
  [Boisbouvier] Who were these people killed by? 
  [Plante] All the information in our possession now appears 
to 
indicate that it was armed civilians. 
  [Boisbouvier] Are you able to enter this district? 
  [Plante] Absolutely not. This district is more or less the 
most dangerous one in Kigali, if not the whole of Rwanda. 
[passage omitted] [end recording] 
  [Announcer] The fighting is very fierce, to such an extent 
that a shell exploded this morning on one of the floors of the 
UN headquarters. There were no casualties. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] While condemning the silence of the 
international community on the Rwandan tragedy, we cannot fail 
to deplore today the attitude of the African community, notably 
that of the Organization of African Unity, OAU. 
  Against all expectations, the latter has just accepted that 
the illegal government of criminals sits within the OAU. 
Yesterday we talked about the presence of two Rwandan 
delegations in Tunis, that of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] 
and that of the illegal government, for the 60th meeting of 
African foreign ministers, in preparation for the 30th summit of 
heads of state and governments of OAU member countries. [passage 
omitted] 
  To the great disappointment of the international community, 
the foreign ministers' meeting accorded support to the 
self-proclaimed government of Sindikubwabo. The RPF delegation 
will only participate in the summit of heads of state and 
government of OAU member countries as simple invitees of the OAU 
secretary general. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Seven ethnic groups involved in the recent conflict 
in the northern region have signed a cease-fire agreement in 
Accra. The agreement was signed under the auspices of the 
seven-member permanent government negotiating team. Newlove 
Mamata was at the signing ceremony: 
  [Begin recording] [Mamata] The seven-member permanent 
government negotiating team is chaired by Okumeni Dr. Obiri 
Yeboah, Omahene of Efutu Akwa Traditional Area. The first four 
groups to sign comprise leaders of the Konkomba, Nawuri, 
Nchumuri, and Basari ethnic groups, who form the minority 
faction in the conflict. The majority faction is comprised of 
the Dagbong or Dagomba, the Nanumba, and the Gonja ethnic groups. 
  By the terms of the agreement, the signatories shall observe 
and maintain an immediate, unconditional, and permanent 
cease-fire and disarm in the conflict areas. The agreement 
condemns and deplores the use of any form of violence to achieve 
any ethnic objective, while condemning atrocities committed on 
lives and property. According to the agreement, all sides will 
resolve to settle issues between them by due process of law. 
  The agreement also reaffirms the commitment of both sides to 
the unacceptability of acquiring land by force, to accept the 
principle of the inviolability of life, and condemns the pursuit 
of any sectarian or ethnic agenda that endangers the life and 
safety of other citizens. 
  All the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to peace, and 
promised to adhere to the terms of the agreement. 
  Okumeni Dr. Yeboah reminded both sides of their 
responsibilities under the agreement: 
  [Yeboah] Honorable delegates from the various ethnic groups, 
the permanent negotiation team thanks you very much for the 
support and the cooperation you have given us so far. As I said 
earlier on, your responsibility will be to disseminate the 
contents of the accord you've just signed to your people, in the 
towns and villages in your respective traditional areas, and 
ensure that the contents seep down properly to them. It is the 
wish of the negotiating team to also extend to you again our 
heart-felt thanks for the give-and- take attitude you have taken 
in this issue, and we hope that when we resume and tackle the 
main causes of the dispute, you will still continue to help us. 
  [Mamata] Leaders from both factions will reassemble in Accra 
on Monday, 27 June, to begin serious consultations in a bid to 
find a lasting solution to the conflict. [end recording]

  [Text] The chairman of the Council of State, His Excellency 
David Kpomakpor, said yesterday that the Liberian National 
Transitional Government is adamantly opposed to the formation of 
a transitional army. Speaking at a press briefing at the 
Executive Mansion, Chairman Kpomakpor wondered why people could 
be advancing the idea of the formation of a transitional army at 
a time when Liberians are talking about disarmament. 
  According to LINA [LIBERIAN NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY], the State 
Council chairman said the council did not at any time consider 
the idea of a transitional army debatable as it is 
counterproductive and contrary to the Cotonou Accord. He 
dispelled speculation that the council was discussing the idea 
of a transitional army. He termed such proposals on the part of 
warring factions as a lack of good will, noting that instead of 
talking about the formation of a transitional army, they should 
be submitting themselves to the disarmament process. Chairman 
Kpomakpor said what is necessary now is for this nation to be 
rid of arms and other warlike materials and hoped that warring 
factions will see wisdom in the need to disarm. 
  On ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States 
Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] neutrality, Chairman Kpomakpor said 
that it is unfortunate that the warring factions are looking for 
scapegoats as all of the armed groups are accusing ECOMOG of 
being partial. On the suggestion of changes in the transitional 
government, the State Council chairman said this could not be 
ruled out and disclosed that the council will shortly appoint 
managing directors and heads of autonomous agencies after 
constituting the various public corporation boards. He, 
however, said the council will only appoint managing directors 
and heads of autonomous agencies based on their qualification 
and not on the basis of factional connection.

  [Text] Transitional State Council Chairman David Kpomakpor 
says government is to shortly call on the Organization of 
African Unity to clearly define the role of multinational 
African peacekeeping force in Liberia, ECOMOG [Economic 
Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]. 
Councillor Kpomakpor accused the multinational peacekeeping 
force of failing to take instruction from the transitional 
government and said the force was being indecisive in pushing 
the disarmament of the former warring factions. Councillor 
Kpomakpor squarely blamed the United Nations Observer Mission in 
Liberia and ECOMOG for the stalemate in the disarming of 
fighters because orders were not being taken from government. 
  The blame comes following warnings from the visiting U. S. 
State Department official, Prudence Bushnell, that the United 
States Government will reconsider its position on Liberia by the 
end of the month if up to about 50 percent of the arms are not 
taken away from the fighting groups in Liberia. 
  Councillor Kpomakpor, as an individual member of the State 
Council, has also registered his opposition to the formation of 
a national army by all parties to the Liberian conflict. 
Reports said NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] and 
ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Africa] 
representations on the State Council are in favor of the 
formation of the national army and that pronouncement by 
Councillor Kpomakpor does not represent a consensus view of the 
State Council as called for by the Cotonou Accord regarding 
decision-making.

  [Text] Lagos, June 9 (AFP) -- Security forces Thursday [9 
June] detained Beko Ransome-Kuti, the chairman of Nigeria's 
Campaign for Democracy, an umbrella grouping of human rights and 
pro-democracy groups, a source close to Ransome-Kuti said. 
  The detention came a day after his organization called for 
mass protests next week in an effort to bring down military 
ruler General Sani Abacha. 
  The source said security agents showed up at Ransome-Kuti's 
residence in Lagos, took him to police headquarters for 
interrogation, brought him back to the house and ransacked it 
for about an hour. 
  After the search, which lasted about an hour, they took him 
away and detained him, the source said. 
  Ransome-Kuti was the 11th prominent opposition activist 
detained in a crackdown launched last week. 
  The struggle between the Nigerian Government and the 
opposition has intensified in recent weeks, with the opposition 
accusing the regime of dragging its heels over a return to 
democracy after annulled elections and a military coup last year. 
  The elections were held on June 12 last year as part of 
then- 
military ruler General Ibrahim Babangida's pledge to restore 
democratic rule. But he annulled the election, citing fraud, 
appointed a non-elected interim government then stepped down. 
  Abacha overthrew that government in November and dissolved 
all democratic institutions. 
  The Campaign for Democracy groups about 40 human rights and 
pro- democracy associations. 
  In a statement Wednesday, it said that from next week, 
"market women and men should lock their shops, drivers and 
transport owners should remove their vehicle from the streets.

  [Text] Lagos, 9 Jun (AFP) -- Members of the disbanded 
Senate, most of whom are wanted by the police for opposing the 
regime, today renounced their decision to surrender "en masse" 
to the police. The disclosure was made to AFP this morning by 
one of their spokesmen in Lagos. 
  One of the former senators, contacted by AFP on 7 June on 
his 
underground telephone, had indicated that a group of his 
colleagues planned to surrender "within 48 hours" to the police 
"for the security forces to do what they like with us, and the 
earlier the better." 
  The spokesman, speaking in a telephone interview from his 
hideout, pointed out that "we have reconsidered our decision. I 
think we can be more effective outside rather than inside the 
prison walls." 
  He further said that "it is perhaps silly to surrender so 
easily and be imprisoned, whereas there are so many things that 
we can deal with while we are free." 
  The former senators issued a communique yesterday in which 
they described the regime as illegal, and called on it to take 
all the necessary steps to proclaim Chief Moshood Abiola the 
presumed winner of the 12 June 1993 presidential election, 
which were annulled by the military government. 
  Last week the Nigerian security forces began a series of 
arrests within the opposition ranks, which had called on General 
Abacha to relinquish power and hand over the reins of office to 
Moshood Abiola. 
  Two arrested persons, former Senate President Ameh Ebute and 
one of his colleagues, Polycarp Nwite, were charged on 6 June 
with "plotting and treason," an offense punishable by life 
imprisonment. 
  Instead of surrendering in a group to the police, the 
senators plan to file a legal suit to prevent the government 
from "harassing" them, their spokesman stressed.

<F P=106> [By Ade Obisesan] </F>
  [Text] Lagos, 10 Jun (AFP) -- Members of Nigeria's 
dissolved parliament have appealed to Moshood Abiola, presumed 
winner of presidential elections a year ago, to name a 
government on Sunday [12 June], an ex-legislator said Friday. 
Members of the abolished House of Representatives advised 
Abiola to submit to the upper house, the Senate, a cabinet list 
which should be "broad-based, reconciliatory and of national 
unity," the legislator, who requested anonymity, told AFP by 
telephone. 
  The Senate, also dissolved last November when the regime of 
General Sani Abacha seized power, has issued a similar call to 
Abiola. Abiola has pledged to form his government by Sunday, 
the first anniversary of the poll, which was declared free and 
fair by international observers but annulled by then junta 
leader Ibrahim Babangida, who alleged irregularities. The 
millionaire Yoruba businessman has also promised to reconvene 
the Senate, to which he plans to submit his nominees as 
stipulated under the 1989 constitution, ratified by General 
Babangida's regime. 
  After their second clandestine meeting in a week on 
Thursday, 
the ex-legislators issued a communique urging civilian state 
governors, who were also sacked by the military, to resume the 
mandate for which they were elected in 1991. They also called 
on the international community and governments to accord Abiola 
immediate recognition as soon as he is sworn in as president and 
commander-in- chief of the Armed Forces. 
  The communique was signed by seven members representing 
different parts of the country. 
  In spite of government warnings, Abiola has insisted on 
forming his government, challenging the military government to 
arrest him. The National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) a 
pro-democracy group which has been championing the cause of 
Abiola, has declared Saturday a national day of mourning for the 
"12 June martyrs", a reference to hundreds of Nigerians who died 
last year during protests against the annulment of the 
presidential election. 
  To mark the day, NADECO has called on all Nigerians to wear 
black or white armbands or headbands, the group's national 
secretary, Ayo Opadokun, was quoted as saying in the press on 
Friday. Although the group said that it was not planning to 
overthrow the Abacha regime or organise a violent demonstration 
against it, the Campaign for Democracy (CD), a NADECO affiliate, 
has called for nationwide civil disobedience from Monday. 
During a "national week of action", the CD plans to organise 
street protests, set up barricades, start bonfires and organise 
rallies, all aimed at promoting "a popular national democratic 
government" to be headed by Abiola, a CD statement said. 
  As a precautionary measure in the face of the mounting 
tension, three universities including the University of Ilorin 
in central Nigeria, were closed down Thursday by academic 
authorities, press reports said here Friday.

  [Text] The University of Illorin has been closed 
indefinitely. This followed a peaceful demonstration by students 
of the institution, demanding for the improvement of basic 
amenities on the campus. A statement by the university 
authorities today directed the students to vacate their campuses 
by 4 o'clock in the afternoon [1500 GMT]. Our correspondent, 
who visited the campuses, reports that the students have started 
moving with their property out of their hostels, in compliance 
to the order, while policemen have been drafted to ensure the 
safety of life and property.

  [Text] The Federal Government has warned that it would not 
condone any overtly political remarks from any group or 
individual in the country. The chief of general staff, 
Lieutenant General Oladipo Diya, stated this in Lagos. Gen. 
Diya maintained that the law would deal ruthlessly with persons 
agitating for open rebellion against the government. He 
therefore asked pressure groups and agitators for the 
installation of any person they conceive as the winner of the 
June 12 election to refrain from such acts, in the interest of 
the nation. The chief of general staff reminded such political 
activists and social critics that the annulled June 12 election 
was now history.

  [Excerpt] The chief of general staff, Lieutenant General 
Oladipo Diya, has advised Chief Moshood Abiola not to confront 
the government by making good his reported intention to be sworn 
in as president on Sunday [12 June]. Gen. Diya was speaking 
with State House correspondent Mohamed Labe shortly on arrival 
in Abuja from his three-day consultation with traditional rulers 
and leaders of thought across the country: 
  [Begin recording] [Diya] We continue to appeal to Chief M.K. 
Abiola not to confront the government. I have said this, that 
Chief Abiola believes in God. He is a very good Muslim. He 
knows that it is God that gives one a position, and I know that 
Chief M.K. Abiola would not want to see this country -- this 
country that has reduced from what it used to be -- he wouldn't 
want to see this country in chaos. I think he will not do it. 
  [Labe] On his confutations with traditional rulers and 
leaders of thought, he said the talks had been successful. 
  [Diya] I think they have been very very successful. I am 
more reassured now than ever before that our traditional rulers, 
our elders are all committed to a united and very strong Nigeria. 
  [Labe] For three days, the chief of general staff criss- 
crossed the country, talking with northern traditional rulers 
and elders and their counterparts in the east, Edo, Delta, and 
leaders of thought of the southwest. The traditional rulers 
assured the Federal Government of their loyalty. [passage

  [Text] Nigeria's Foreign Affairs Minister Ambassador Baba 
Gana Kingibe has described as ill-advised the threat to form a 
government by Chief M.K.O. Abiola. Ambassador Kingibe, who was 
speaking with the PAN-AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY in Tunis, said he 
believed there was a better way of tackling the problem created 
by the annulment of the 12 June election. According to him, 12 
June was a democratic event endorsed by the people of Nigeria 
and, therefore, it would be wrong of anybody who is talking of 
democracy to seek to impose his vision without consulting the 
people on the political future of Nigeria. 
  He said the only way to reach all Nigerians on the issue was 
through their elected representatives in the national 
constitutional conference scheduled to begin later this month. 
Ambassador Kingibe, who was Abiola's running mate in the 
annulled election, said he did not run with Chief Abiola to be 
vice president of Nigeria by force. He advised Abiola to 
consider the implications of his actions on the nation and 
accept the realities of the moment. Ambassador Kingibe gave an 
assurance that the present military administration will 
disengage from politics and hand over power to an elected 
democratic government through the national constitutional 
conference.

  [Text] Lagos, 9 Jun (AFP) -- The call by the opposition 
Campaign for Democracy [CD] for civil disobedience last week in 
Nigeria was made in agreement with the opposition National 
Democratic Coalition [NADECO]. This was disclosed this evening 
to AFP by a top NADECO official. 
  "Civil disobedience is part of NADECO's stipulated lines of 
action. The CD is helping to organize it," added the official, 
who was speaking by telephone from his hideout. 
  "For the moment, NADECO will not appear much in the 
forefront 
of the political scene, and will operate through several 
organizations, including the CD," the same source said, while 
refusing to disclose his identity. 
  The CD, which comprises nearly 40 human rights defense 
committees and associations for democracy "is affiliated to 
NADECO and closely collaborates with it," the official stated. 
  The CD had on 8 June called on Nigerians to stage a one-week 
mass protest effective 13 June to press for the rapid departure 
of the ruling military regime and the formation of a government 
by Moshood Abiola, the self-proclaimed winner of the 12 June 
1993 presidential election.

  [Text] The traditional rulers of the seven eastern states 
have pledged their loyalty to the Federal Government. In a 
statement signed by the chairman of Imo state council of indieze 
[traditional rulers], Eze Onu Egoke, on behalf of the 
traditional rulers of the seven eastern states, they said they 
did not want secession, but a united Nigeria. The statement 
also said the traditional rulers had accepted to attend the 
constitutional conference which, they say, offers Nigerians the 
opportunity to air their views effectively on issues that affect 
them. They said they believed in democracy and the return of 
Nigeria to democratic rule as early as possible. The statement 
was issued following the meeting the traditional rulers had with 
the chief of general staff on the current political situation in 
the country.

  [Text] Cape Town June 9 SAPA -- The government was 
committed to reconciliation, and nation-building had been 
central to the African National Congress's policy since its 
establishment in 1912, President Nelson Mandela said on 
Thursday. Answering questions atthe World Economic Forum's 
southern African summit in Cape Town, he said in the past 
opponents of apartheid who had applied for indemnity had had to 
state what crimes they had committed. 
  "Now we say we want to be even-handed." Those who had 
committed crimes in defence of apartheid would have to subscribe 
to the same conditions. This was the only way in which the 
wounds of the past could be healed. 
  Mr Mandela stressed the intention was not to institute 
Nuremburg-style trials. 
  He added that the category of apartheid defenders being 
referred to was those who had thought they were implementing 
policies in which they believed, and not those who had planned 
the murder of innocent people. 
  "I hope all of you will accept our bona fides. We want to 
say 
we are committed to reconciliation." 
  The ANC had said from its inception that South Africa 
belonged to all its people, black and white -- and in the 1950's 
152 leaders of the people had been charged with treason for this 
principle. 
  "We are the one organisation whose bona fides should not be 
questioned," President Mandela said.

  [Text] Cape Town June 9 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela 
said on Thursday he was personally opposed to privatisation as 
it amounted to a form of maintaining apartheid in economic 
issues. Answering questions at the World Economic Forum 
conference in Cape Town, he said in terms of privatisation, 
people with capital were advantaged -- that is, "not blacks, 
only whites". 
  The "democratic government" would therefore be deprived of 
resources. 
  "This (privatisation) is not seen here in the same way as in 
Switzerland," Mr Mandela added to laughter. 
  The privatisation of such assets as airports and harbours 
"cannot be in the interests of the masses of the people". 
  Asked whether he was prepared to give a glimpse into the 
June 
22 budget, Mr Mandela said to more laughter that he did not want 
to "take you into confidence" but that he was sure the minister 
of finance, Mr Derek Keys -- who was present at the conference 
-- "will be pleased to answer".

  [Text] Cape Town June 9 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress had made it clear in an investment guide in 1992 that 
foreign investments in South Africa would not be expropriated, 
President Nelson Mandela said on Thursday. Answering questions 
at the World Economic Forum conference in Cape Town he said the 
commitment of the government of the next five years to consensus 
would ensure that it was "not likely for us to do anything that 
will antagonise investors". 
  A poll last year had also shown that business leaders had 
confidence in South Africa's future. 
  The government had no hesitation in saying the country today 
had no free market economy. More than 80 per cent of shares on 
the Johannesburg Stock Exchange belonged to five conglomerates. 
  The government was the "only people who are going to make 
the 
market work in the historic sense of the word".

  [Text] Cape Town June 9 SAPA -- People should not have 
exaggerated expectations of the government's Reconstruction and 
Development Programme [RDP], President Nelson Mandela said on 
Thursday at the World Economic Forum's two-day meeting in Cape 
Town. Leaders had a duty to point out to the people their basic 
demands could not be met overnight. It could take up to five 
years. 
  The government had raised R2.5 billion [rand] from its own 
resources for reconstruction. 
  Past wastage of resources and distortion of priorities had 
to 
be borne in mind. For instance, R10 billion had been spent on 
arms and ammunition while South Africa had been under no threat 
from its neighbours, although only R2 billion had been spent on 
housing in the same period. 
  Mr Mandela said the government proposed a more balanced and 
effective tax collection system. 
  Once the country had addressed its internal problems, 
especially violence, it would be on the way to creating a 
climate for investment. 
  Mr Mandela said the development programme and the African 
National Congress' manifesto also addressed the problems of 
small business in South Africa. 
  He encouraged investors to form partnerships with black 
businessmen and said the government was looking at the 
difficulties black businessmen had in obtaining credit from 
banks. It was considering the formation of a bank to finance 
black business.

African National Defense Force] is proving to be less than 
satisfactory, causing unnecessary tensions and hardships for 
many MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation; ANC military 
wing] members who want to join the army and serve the new South 
Africa. 
  While the process of integration has been agreed to in 
negotiations, to date the newly appointed chief of the army, 
General Meiring, has as yet failed to confirm the appointments 
of senior officers who would be charged with overseeing 
implementation. 
  At the same time, administrative errors and deficiencies 
have 
resulted in the names of many longstanding MK cadres not 
appearing on the official list. Instead of resolving this 
constructively, utilising the presence of these cadres at the 
agreed assembly points, there has been a high-handed instruction 
to simply send them back to the regions. 
  The ANC urges that the minister of defence and the chief of 
the army pay special attention to the plight of these soldiers. 
At present there are approximately 2,000 people who have been 
removed from the Wallmannsthal assembly area. 
  The unfortunate manner in which these cadres were dealt with 
is unacceptable, and resulted in their spending the night on the 
street. 
  The inadequate situation affecting logistics and resources, 
including food and clothing, at all assembly points should also 
be urgently addressed by the chief of the army. 
  All of the above has been raised with the minister of 
defence, including the decision making process and lines of 
authority. We look forward to his immediate attention to the 
problem so that it can be resolved without further dispute or 
tension, and in the spirit of ensuring harmonious and effective 
integration.

  [Text] Pretoria June 9 SAPA -- South Africa's nine 
provinces would receive their first powers on Friday, provincial 
premiers said after a meeting with government ministers at the 
Union Buildings in Pretoria on Thursday. "Certain powers are 
definitely coming our way. They are not half as many as we 
wanted to get," KwaZulu/Natal Premier Frank Mdlalose said. 
  He said the first powers would be gazetted on Friday. He 
referred to these as phase one powers. 
  PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Premier Tokyo 
Sexwale said it was not correct that premiers were up in arms 
about the delay in receiving powers. He said the first powers 
allotted to the provinces would be powers that allowed the 
provinces to set up their administrations. 
  Although the provinces have been assigned certain powers by 
the constitution, all powers have been temporarily assigned to 
central government departments. They will be re-assigned to the 
provinces when the provinces are able to prove that they have 
the administrative capacity to exercise the powers. 
  The premiers' meeting was attended by Constitutional 
Development and Provincial Affairs Minister Roelf Meyer and 
Public Service and Administration Minister Zola Skweyiya. Also 
in attendance were Minister Without Portfolio Jay Naidoo, the 
Deputy Minister of Constitutional Development Mohammed Valli 
Moosa and the deputy minister of finance, Alec Erwin. 
  The premiers were given a presentation of the government's 
white paper on reconstruction and development which acting North 
West Premier Satish Roopa said had set out structures for the 
implementation and monitoring of the RDP [Research and 
Development Program]. 
  According to a statement issued by Mr Meyer and Dr Skweyiya, 
Mr Naidoo gave an overview of the RDP "with a view to 
encouraging development planning on provincial and local levels". 
  Many of the objectives of the RDP will be implemented by the 
provincial governments at local level. 
  Not all the provinces would receive all their powers at the 
same time, Mr Sexwale said. It depended on their administrative 
capacity. 
  Eastern Transvaal Premier Mathews Phosa said the provincial 
powers were "no longer an issue". 
  "They will be given out in phases," he said. The premiers 
had 
been satisfied by their meeting. 
  Mr Skweyiya said the assignment of powers "will be based on 
the responses from the provinces before 17 June, 1994 to 
submissions made by the public service commission. 
  "The assignment of powers can now start taking place on the 
assumption that the administrative capacities to assume these 
powers are in place." 
  The statement said government ministers would visit the 
provinces over the next fortnight to discuss issues. 
  "A permanent forum between relevant central government 
ministers and provincial premiers is to be implemented. This 
forum will meet on a monthly basis," the statement said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Eastern Transvaal Premier Mathews Phosa by </F>
SABC announcers Eon de Vos and Dorienne Berry on the "Good 
Morning South Africa" program -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] This morning is the first of a 
series in which "Good Morning South Africa" will introduce you 
to the new members of the government. In the studio with us 
today is Mr. Mathews Phosa, the premier of the Eastern Transvaal 
Province. Welcome to you. But before we start, let's look at a 
background sketch on Mr. Phosa and the Eastern Transvaal. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Berry] Nice to have you with us in the studio. You have two 
obvious problems that one wonders how you're going to address. 
The one is that one of your biggest potential earners, the 
Kruger Park, is divided between two provinces, yours and 
Northern Transvaal, and you have the story of the two capitals. 
Which one should we take first, the Kruger Park? 
  [Phosa] Let's start with the Kruger Park. The Kruger Park 
stretches from around Messina right into the Eastern Transvaal. 
The administrative structures are in the Eastern Transvaal and 
I think they are going to remain there. 
  [Berry] Can you ensure that, because it doesn't make sense 
not to do that. 
  [Phosa] Well, we have dealt with that already. What we need 
to do, we need to be fair to the Northern Transvaal. We need to 
share some aspect of the income, because some of the tourists 
will be going through the Northern Transvaal and of course the 
national government will also want to take the Kruger National 
Park, which is quite reasonable. So that's an area which we 
need to contest and see what we get out of it. 
  With regard to the capital, at the moment we have allowed a 
debate to continue because we've always said that we should have 
people-driven decisions taken, and this is a good example. 
We've allowed a very good debate to go on. It has narrowed to 
Witbank and Nelspruit, and we interviewed Witbank and Nelspruit 
last week. They both made substantial presentations, and we've 
now asked them to come together and say to us how much will it 
cost. It's going to depend on the cost now. We cannot ignore 
the cost. It would be stupid to do so. If it's going to be 
cheap to have a capital in Nelspruit, we'll have it in 
Nelspruit. If it's going to be cheap to have it in Witbank, 
we'll have it in Witbank. So we're going to look at the cost 
and the cost only. 
  [Berry] I must say to the viewers in the Eastern Transvaal 
who have just joined us, you specifically. We were talking 
earlier, and he actually doesn't have any preconceptions, so 
it's going to be a fair choice. 
  [Phosa] It must be a fair choice, and I'm happy that it will 
have been a choice proceeded by expansive consultations and 
input from business and the community as a whole, and that gives 
me a very good feeling about the matter -- the way it's been 
handled. 
  [De Vos] A lot of problems can be solved through 
negotiations 
and talking to people, and finding out what budgets are and what 
moneys are available. But some of the other problems that also 
came out in this profile we saw on the province, I think one of 
the major problems that you do face is the pollution problem 
through the heavy industry which the province has and also 
through forestry. You know, trees being planted on the upper 
slopes, retaining the water, etcetera, etcetera. Those two 
problems coupled to Kangwane, which has a growth rate at the 
moment of about 7 percent, which is one of the highest in the 
country. Now put those together and you have a major headache 
on its way. Have you considered those issues? 
  [Phosa] Well, the question of pollution is not peculiar only 
to the Eastern Transvaal. It's a problem peculiar to 
industrialization and a lot of things are being done to try and 
reduce the level of pollution, especially in areas of Witbank. 
I was mentioning to you earlier this funny concept about 
healthy pollution. It's very expensive to get involved in [word 
indistinct] pollution. But something is being done. I am 
satisfied there. We discussed it with members of the Witbank 
town council because it is a matter of concern. The ozone layer 
is quite low there, and we need to deal with it on a continuous 
basis. The same thing with forestry. One other thing that we 
have to look at is how to conserve nature; and we are going to 
be very strict with some of the companies which are not careful 
about how to deal with nature like water and everything. The 
aspect of the 7 percent, it's related to the entire region; it's 
in fact 9 percent of the national GDP [Gross Domestic Product]. 
We are the second smallest region, but we are the fourth 
strongest economically in the country. 
  [Berry] When we talk about Kangwane, it has a high 
unemployment rate, the people are poor, they're close to game 
reserves. How are you going to enforce the preservation of our 
natural resources as in wild life and trees and bushes, and that 
sort of thing, as well as managing to help these people? 
  [Phosa] You see, we've got two rural settlements in the 
Eastern Transvaal; it's Kangwane and Kwandebele. There is 
enough room for everybody. The tourism development which we 
want to embark on is not going to affect in any way the 
residential areas of the people in Kwandebele or Kangwane. The 
beauty of the Eastern Transvaal is there, it's given. It's how 
we are going to develop it. 
  Now, we obviously are talking about decentralizing power in 
Eastern Transvaal. In a particular way the issue of the capital 
is part of the discussion. We want to create the one stop 
service: Witbank, Nelspruit, Secunda, where you will have 
officials who will give service to the people and resolve 
problems of people on the spot. But the third element is 
departmental decentralization which is guided by the needs and 
the resource base. Here again we are having debates. We think 
it is a very good idea to bring government close to the people, 
where decisions can be taken at the lowest local level. You 
don't disrupt people, you don't shuttle people around, you say 
tourism is best suited in Nelspruit, Hazyview, Sabie. You put 
your head office there for tourism. Trade and industry is in 
Secunda, you put it there. Most economic activities are in 
Witbank, you put it there. Policing is more in Middelburg. You 
put it there. You don't shuttle people around in this whole 
transformation. 
  [De Vos] I wonder if Middelburg will agree with the policing 
[laughter]. 
  [Berry] And are you looking for the policy of educating the 
people into not bleeding land, not stripping the trees, and 
deforesting the area? Half of Northern Transvaal has been 
completely wiped out. Look at Lesotho and the terrible erosion 
there. 
  [Phosa] We don't have such a problem in Eastern Transvaal. 
On the contrary, we have too many forests, and we are happy to 
have those forests. We would like them to grow. That's an 
industry on its own. We don't have that problem really. We 
would want to focus on empowering our people. We do have a 
number of problems. You heard what was mentioned there. A lot 
of these big companies make money in the Eastern Transvaal and 
it flows out to some headquarters somewhere. We do have a 
problem with that and we are going to engage commerce and 
industry into serious discussion which will lead to them having 
to invest substantial parts of their profit from where they get 
the wealth. We have a problem with that. Per capita income is 
180 rands per month. It's very low, taking into account the 
wealth of the province. Now we need to reinvest in there. 
Questions like beneficiations [as heard] of raw material in 
Eastern Transvaal can only lead to more job creation for our 
people there and absorb this labor force in Kangwane and 
Kwandebele in other areas, in urban areas. Now those type of 
things will require a lot of discussions. 
  [Berry] From a personal point of view, you personally, what 
do you see as your greatest challenge? 
  [Phosa] Well, the greatest challenge at the moment is to 
improve the living and working conditions of our people, if I 
may put it in that (?crisp) manner. You look at the health 
aspect of our situation. It's deplorable. We need to adjust 
that. We have been offered a number of clinics by a company 
which for ethical reasons I will not mention -- more than 20 
clinics. Now we are going to identify spots where they are most 
needed and put those clinics there, and these are modern 
clinics. And education, technical educational and other types 
of education; we have been offered a university, the funds are 
there, we don't take one cent from the government. We want to 
proceed with that project. We want to twin that university with 
one of the top international universities in the world, because 
we want it to have that status of a proper university which will 
produce people who will be immediately useful to the economic 
activity of the Eastern Transvaal. We want to produce planners 
and researchers which we don't have at the moment. We want to 
produce good managers and good administrators, which we don't 
have at the moment. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Address by South African President Nelson Mandela at the </F>
WEF southern Africa summit in Cape Town, South Africa, on 9 
June; issued on 9 June on the SAPA PR Wire Service] 
  [Text] Your Excellencies; 
  President Sam Nujoma of Namibia; President Robert Mugabe 
of Zimbabwe; President Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania; visiting 
cabinet ministers; business leaders, and fellow South Africans 
  Allow me to express my gratitude to the organisers of the 
World Economic Forum [WEF] for this timely august summit of 
southern African leaders and world business. It is particularly 
significant for us that this summit should take place in South 
Africa, and Cape Town in particular, so soon after the 
epoch-making changes that have taken place. 
  That we can meet at this level, at the southern tip of the 
continent, is tribute to a mission fulfilled. We once more 
express our profound gratitude to your excellencies, the 
business leaders and the world at large for the generous 
solidarity you extended to us during the dark days of apartheid. 
  The rebirth that we celebrate in South Africa is indeed a 
rebirth of the region and the continent. This is our collective 
achievement which has opened up new opportunities for us to 
exploit our great potential and, indeed, to boldly cross the 
threshold to a new and great era. At last, Africa in general and 
southern Africa in particular, can build a new all-inclusive 
partnership based on freedom, democracy and social justice. 
  For us in South Africa, this is a time of great joy. Joy at 
the rediscovery, as a united people, of our common humanity, our 
common interests and our common destiny. 
  Ours is a delicate transition. But we are confident that we 
have entered it with a new national spirit. The first democratic 
elections which we have just conducted and the atmosphere of 
peace that has prevailed in this period inspires us with 
confidence that we shall succeed in our endeavours. 
  Lest we forget: the transformation we are living through is 
the result of years of intensive and protracted struggle. It is 
a result of difficult and sometimes harrowing negotiations. A 
process that ultimately resulted in the meeting of minds among 
the major political players. 
  We are heartened by the progress already made by the 
government of national unity in reaching consensus on the most 
important challenges facing the nation. 
  Differences do remain. But they manifest themselves within 
the context of non-racial democracy. There is a spirit abroad to 
ensure that we achieve the common objectives that we have set 
ourselves, primarily to build a better life for all our people 
and ensure peace, stability and economic growth. The 
constitutional assembly will soon sit to draft a new 
constitution for the country. And we are confident that the 
spirit of consensus-seeking which characterised the multi-party 
negotiations will display itself fully in this regard. 
  Quite certainly, transitions everywhere do breed 
uncertainty. 
And South Africa is no exception. In particular, we experienced 
significant outflows of capital, and we still experience caution 
among domestic and foreign investors. But the tide is turning, 
occasioned by the manifest display of a national togetherness 
that South Africa has hitherto never experienced. 
  We face a long and hard road to address the havoc wrought by 
decades of apartheid. The challenge to ensure social justice and 
stability is as urgent as it is crucial. 
  Put in brief, this means building a people-centred and 
caring society. It requires that we use all our resources and 
skills to broaden the base of the economy and ensure that it 
serves all the people. 
  It demands that we enlarge the pool of skills and unleash 
the 
energies of the people, as a whole, to contribute to the twin 
processes of nation-building and economic development. 
  It also entails addressing the disparities in residential 
infrastructure, income distribution, provision of health 
facilities and educational opportunities. 
  The government of national unity is of the unanimous view 
that all this needs to be done and done urgently. But also that 
the reconstruction and development targets that we set ourselves 
should not upset macro-economic balances and undermine fiscal 
discipline. 
  All of us recognise that peace and stability are crucial for 
economic growth and development. We are determined to ensure 
that all South Africans, including those who fear democracy, can 
rest assured in the knowledge that change is in their interest 
too. 
  This challenge is as much a South African one as it applies 
to the region as a whole. Now that we have redeemed our pledge 
with destiny, the people of southern Africa can start in earnest 
to build a peaceful and developing sub-continent. We have to 
urgently resolve the problems of conflict in parts of the 
region, whilst we undo the effects of apartheid destabilisation. 
  Now we can together address the legacy of colonial under- 
development and imbalances within and among countries of the 
region. We can together galvanise the human and material 
resources that the region commands, to serve the people. We can 
together develop the physical infrastructure necessary for 
development across all countries. 
  For these goals to be achieved, we need to start setting out 
the integrated strategies required. This also means urgently 
addressing the merging patterns that would, in the long run, not 
benefit the region. 
  The lop-sided development bequeathed us by our colonial past 
has resulted in the relative under-development of many countries 
of the region. Related to this is the danger of unhealthy 
migration of capital as well as skilled personnel to areas with 
developed infrastructure. It is to the overall advantage of the 
region that this trend is arrested and reversed. More 
accurately, it needs to be obviated through strategies for 
regional economic integration. 
  In the more distant future, our common objective is the 
realisation of the Treaty of Abudja, the creation of an African 
common market. In the near future, we are faced with the task of 
ensuring that the programmes of both the SADC [Southern African 
Development Community] and Comesa [Common Market for Eastern and 
Southern Africa] are realised in the new political and social 
context. With regional integration will emerge a mutually 
beneficial arrangement regarding movement of goods, capital and 
labour. 
  Such regional integration will need to address the broad 
task 
of reconstruction and development in the entire region. 
  We will venture to say, that modern economic planning 
dictates that inter-national co-operation requires more that 
just agreements on macro-economic imperatives and broad 
development projects. For, impacting on these factors is the 
basic question on how the partners jointly and severally create 
an economic environment which attracts investments and benefits 
ordinary people. 
  This means jointly grappling with issues such as: 
  Delivery of employment, shelter, nutrition, health, 
education 
and training for some 100-million people on a sustainable basis; 
prioritising the areas, within our own countries, most in 
need, and doing it in such a way that we stimulate sustainable 
growth and development; seeking and finding the balance 
between our noble goals and the resource opportunities and 
constraints; avoiding economic and financial arrangements, 
including the debt-trap, which can only have the effect of 
eroding our countries' sovereignty. 
  We who are only starting to take the first steps out of the 
mire of racial subjugation, are well aware that the experience 
countries of the region have gathered will stand us in good 
stead. We can only benefit from the new relationship that is 
emerging. 
  As we take our rightful place among nations of Africa, South 
Africa commits itself to join our neighbours in rising to the 
mammoth challenge presented by a growing affliction in many 
parts of the world known as "Afro-pessimism" -- loss of 
confidence in our continent's capacity to overcome 
under-development and declining standards. 
  It is a task which we are called upon to undertake with a 
singleness of purpose and with confidence, remembering that the 
thriving countries of Asia, the socalled Asian Tigers were only 
20 years ago written off as hopeless basket cases. This can only 
be achieved if there is purposeful interaction among our 
countries. 
  Democratic South Africa enters this new partnership as one 
player amongst many. We harbour no desire to be the dominant 
partner, for the region and South Africa itself would lose in 
the long run. We entertain no illusion of becoming the regional 
benefactor because such capacity we do not possess. 
  Rather, we seek to join governments of the region in taking 
up the cudgels on behalf of all the peoples. We seek to join 
them in attracting significant investment flows and in reaching 
beneficial trade agreements. Along with countries of the region 
we are determined to ensure that the goods mined, harvested and 
manufactured in the region become internationally competitive. 
We are committed to strengthen regional institutions such as the 
SADC and Comesa and at the same time strengthen bilateral 
relations with each of our neighbours. 
  This we resolved to do both as a government and in 
partnership with various institutions of civil society such as 
business houses, trade unions, as well as educational, health 
and other bodies. 
  We are confident that South Africa will soon achieve the 
rates of growth necessary for us to meet our objectives. The 
last two quarters have demonstrated that GDP [gross domestic 
product] growth is on the upswing. This will be of benefit not 
only to South Africa's people but will help the movement towards 
greater southern African prosperity. 
  The path that South Africa has traversed might be unique in 
many respects. But, to the extent that we have based ourselves 
on the experiences of southern Africa and Africa as a whole, it 
is a common achievement and common heritage. 
  One month into post-colonial Africa, in the true sense of 
the 
word, we are confident that regional and continental efforts 
will ensure that the injunction -- God bless Africa -- finds 
full expression in our prosperity.

  [Text] Cape Town June 9 SAPA -- The South African 
Government viewed nationalisation as a constitutional option 
which should not be applied, President Nelson Mandela said on 
Thursday. Answering questions after his opening address to the 
two-day World Economic Forum [WEF] conference in Cape Town, he 
said a clause of the African National Congress' Freedom Charter 
of 1955 had called for the nationalisation of a "limited sector" 
of the economy -- the mines, banks and monopolies. 
  That had been the correct strategy because history had shown 
countries had not been able to escape nationalisation after a 
trauma such as war. 
  However, he and the ANC had been "so hammered" on the 
nationalisation issue at the 1992 WEF conference in Davos, 
Switzerland, that it "became clear that although we were correct 
in this strategy, we had to do something if we wanted investment 
in the country", Mr Mandela said -- to applause and laughter 
from the international and local delegates. 
  The ANC had, therefore, shifted its stance and its position 
today was exactly the same as that of Germany, where the 
constitution provided for nationalisation but where it had not 
been implemented for decades. 
  "Now our position is a pragmatic one," President Mandela 
added.

  [Excerpts] Following the incidents in (Musaga) and Bwiza, 
the mayor of Bujumbura township, Mr. Leonce Sinzikayo, assessed 
the security situation in the municipality: 
  [Begin Sinzikayo recording] Regarding these incidents, one 
can also say that the people of Mutangano, [word indistinct] 
Gakikungu, yesterday afternoon between 1600-1700 hours, there 
were heavy exchanges of gunfire and even explosions which 
frightened the population. I told them that these occurred in 
the mountains where security forces from Nyambuye, while 
patrolling the mountains, had met an element of the armed groups 
from Muyira. So there were exchanges of fire, explosions; this 
is what was heard in the afternoon. [passage omitted] 
  I would like to say that what is happening in the mountains 
may cause fear among the population of the municipality of 
Bujumbura. So I would like to ask the population to be 
vigilant, the town is sufficiently protected for the time being. 
Even regarding what is happening in the mountains, I believe 
that the Armed Forces will be able to dislodge or dismantle the 
armed groups. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Excerpts] An extraordinary Council of Ministers' meeting 
was held yesterday under the chairmanship, in turns, of Mr. 
Anatole Kanyenkiko, the prime minister, and of Mr. Sylvestre 
Ntibantunganya, the interim head of state. The members of the 
council analyzed exclusively the issue of the full restoration 
of the presidential institution. The prime minister informed 
the Council of Ministers on the progress made in the 
consultations regarding this issue from 31 May to 4 June 1994 
with legally recognized political parties. [passage omitted] 
  The Council of Ministers noted that certain preconditions 
set 
by the group of opposition parties were being met, notably the 
ongoing disarmament operation. The government reiterated that 
the process was to continue and [words indistinct] but the 
government considered that it was technically impossible to set 
a timetable for the operation given that the latter would be 
undertaken whenever it was needed. This is an important issue 
given that during recent previous meetings, the council went so 
far as asking that laws and regulations on the possession of 
arms [words indistinct] (?even) knives, machetes, etc, be 
revised. [passage omitted] 
  While maintaining peace and security, the council 
recommended 
to the prime minister to speed up his consultations which should 
result in a formula for the full restoration of the presidential 
institution. The government's wish is for Burundi to have a new 
head of state by 1 July 1994 at the latest. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In Burundi, now led by its second interim president 
since Melchior Ndadaye was assassinated, the National Assembly 
deputies are expected to elect the next president by 1 July. 
This was announced by Foreign Minister Jean-Marie Ngendahayo. 
Speaking to Christophe Boisbouvier he explained the objectives 
of the government to end the institutional vacuum created after 
President Ntaryamira died together with the Rwandan president. 
  [Begin recording] [Ngendahayo] The government decided to 
make 
1 July--Independence Day--as the deadline. It decided that by 
that date we should have a president duly elected and sworn-in. 
  [Boisbouvier] Who will elect him? 
  [Ngendahayo] Deputies, the National Assembly, obviously. 
  [Boisbouvier] Which party will the candidate who will be 
elected come from? 
  [Ngendahayo] According to the agreements signed in Kigobe 
and 
(?Kazagar) the candidate should come from within the ranks of 
the Frodebu [Front for Democracy in Burundi]. 
  [Boisbouvier] What if the Uprona [Party of National Unity 
and 
Progress] were to oppose this process? Do you have a sufficient 
majority in the Assembly to force the issue through? 
  [Ngendahayo] In any case the Frodebu has a very large 
majority in the National Assembly, enabling it to get a 
constitutional bill through without too many risks. This is the 
first point. The second is, the attitude adopted by the 
national army in days to come: either it follows legality, in 
which case the process is well under way, or it chooses the path 
of adventure and we then experience problems of a putsch as we 
did last October. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] Bujumbura Radio-Television Nationale du 
Burundi Radio in French at 1800 GMT on 12 June reports that 
interim Burundi President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, who was 
interviewed before leaving Bujumbura for the OAU summit in 
Tunisia, spoke about the Rwandan issue. "Burundi's position is 
clear," he said. "We must be absolutely neutral in this 
inter-Rwandan conflict, and we ask all Burundians wherever they 
are, to respect this government's commitment to neutrality in 
the conflict." 
  Ntibantunganya went on to say Burundi has to help Rwanda to 
restore peace and security and that the Arusha agreements must 
be the starting point for negotiations between the Rwandan 
sides. "Given the situation in Rwanda over the last two months, 
these agreements must be adjusted to suit them to the current 
situation," he added.

  [Text] Heavy fighting broke out once again this morning in 
several districts of Kigali. According to UN representatives on 
the ground, cease-fire talks are getting nowhere and the airport 
remains closed. We spoke yesterday evening of the latest 
massacre which had targeted at a group of Tutsi children. Two 
clergymen, Fathers Blanchard and Mayer, had taken in hundreds of 
people, mostly Tutsis, into their church. On 10 June Hutu 
militiamen broke into the church. The UN's Canadian military 
spokesman, Major Plante, spoke with Florence Mavic. 
  [Begin recording] [Plante] Approximately 10 armed men, in 
civilian clothes but well armed, entered the church and asked 
Father Blanchard and Father Otto Mayer not to intervene, 
because, as they said, they had come to evacuate--I repeat, 
evacuate--the people who had taken refuge in the church, about 
250 in total. One of the armed men then told Father Blanchard: 
Father, we are very serious, and we want to prove this to 
you--and then he shot into the crowd and a dozen people were 
killed on the spot at that moment. At the same time, another of 
the armed men threw a tear-gas grenade into the church, 
provoking total panic. At this point, more armed men turned up, 
with several trucks and they picked up all those in the church, 
all those they could find, and they took them away. 
  [Mavic] Could the blue helmets have intervened? 
  [Plante] We cannot intervene for the simple reason that it 
is 
too dangerous, and that we have nowhere near enough men or 
equipment to go and help or to evacuate these people. [end

  [Text] One hundred and seventy people were killed on Friday 
[10 June] by government forces and militias in Kigali. The 
victims were taken from a church at Nyamirambo where over 190 
had taken refuge. Government troops and militias attacked the 
church with machine guns and grenades. The 170 people were 
mainly Tutsis who were forced into trucks and taken for 
slaughter. 
  The continued killing of innocent civilians by government 
forces is an indication of the refusal by the government to 
accept conditions given by the Rwandan Patriotic Front for 
cease-fire negotiations.

<F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>
  [Text] Kigali, June 12 (AFP) -- Rebels from the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front (RPF) heavily shelled the capital Kigali Sunday 
[12 June] while maintaining their siege around Gitarama, the 
strategic town where the interim government has set up its 
headquarters. 
  Major Jean-Guy Plante, spokesman for the UN Assistance 
Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR), said interim Prime Minister Jean 
Kambanda was still in Gitarama although interim President 
Theodore Sindikubwabo and several ministers had left the city 
earlier in the week. 
  He said officially, Sindikubwabo and his entourage are to 
spend about a week in northwestern Gisenyi before returning to 
Gitarama, located 50 kiLometres (30 miles) south of the capital. 
  The mainly Hutu interim government established its 
headquarters in Gitarama last month after the Tutsi-dominated 
RPF began to close in on the capital. 
  The rebels since then have taken control of areas south of 
Gitarama and on Saturday opened a new front to the northwest of 
the town. 
  A well-informed military source meanwhile said that "tons 
and 
tons of munitions" have been reaching the rebel headquarters in 
Milundi in the last three weeks, enough to allow the RPF to 
continue fighting "for another year." The source, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity, said government troops were also 
probably receiving weapons and munitions, without which they 
could not continue fighting back. He did not name the country 
where the weapons originated. 
  UNAMIR officials would neither confirm nor deny the report, 
which if proven true would constitute a violation of a UN 
weapons embargo imposed on May 17. 
  "I have no information on this subject," Plante said. 
  Five rounds of UN-brokered peace talks aimed at ending the 
interethnic conflict that has claimed hundreds of thousands of 
lives since April 6 have so far proven fruitless. Another round 
of talks is to begin Monday with leaders from both camps 
expected to participate. 
  Military sources said it is unlikely the rebels would agree 
to lay down their weapons before capturing Gitarama, which is 
strategically located, and would mark a symbolic victory for 
them. The RPF is also demanding a stop to ongoing massacres of 
civilians in government-held territory. 
  Despite pressure by the international community, the carnage 
has persisted unabated with the RPF also accused of executing 
its opponents. 
  The rebels meanwhile have continued making gains on the 
ground and on Sunday shelled Kigali, which is still held by 
government troops. Four shells landed near the Red Cross 
hospital in Kigali, where government troops have placed heavy 
weapons. Previous shelling of the area killed two local Red 
Cross employees. 
  Two districts where government troops massacred Tutsi 
refugees in recent days were also being targeted by the rebels 
over the weekend. 
  The UN has said it is powerless to try and evacuate other 
refugees trapped in the region. 
  Rwanda plunged into an ethnic bloodbath on April 6, after a 
plane carrying the presidents of Rwanda and neighboring Burundi 
was apparently shot down, killing both leaders.

  [Text] UN officials say Rwanda's rump government has moved 
to the northwestern town of Gisenyi, the Hutu ethnic heartland, 
and will move on as far as it can go to escape advancing rebels. 
The UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda military spokesman Major 
General Jean-Guy Plante, told reporters in Kigali that the 
president and some ministers went three or four days ago. 
Gisenyi is the birthplace of the late President Juvenal 
Habyarimana whose death in a rocket attack on his plane on 6 
April sparked mass killings of Tutsis and the resumed civil war. 
Maj. Plante said government officials had said they would stay 
in Gisenyi for a week but it is not clear where they could go 
after that. Many top Army officers, including the Presidential 
Guard, come from Gisenyi. 
  [Bukavu Voix du Zaire in French at 1630 GMT on 12 June in a 
related report adds: "The Rwandan Patriotic Front has now 
managed to open another front to the southwest of the town of 
Gitarama."]

  [Text] Negotiations between representatives of the two 
Rwandan fighting armies continue. The talks started at the UN 
Assistance Mission in Rwanda headquarters at the Amahoro Hotel 
at 0900 and ended its proceedings at 1630. The talks will 
resume on 13 June at 1000 in the morning. 
  The talks are within the framework of efforts aimed at 
achieving a cease-fire. The Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA] 
delegation was led by Colonel Frank Mugambage while Col. Marcel 
Gatsinzi led the Government Army delegation. 
  The talks focused on the cease-fire document. But so far, 
the conditions set by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] have not 
been met by the other party to the negotiations. An example 
among the many others is that up to now the killings carried out 
by the government forces in collaboration with the Interahamwe 
[Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development] 
continue to intensify instead of being brought to a halt which 
is what the RPF has demanded. There are also the propaganda 
programs of Radio Rwanda and Radio-Television Libre des Mille 
Collines which continue to incite the people to kill one another 
and to send them to the killing battlefields. 
  Col. Gatsinzi, the leader of the government Army delegation, 
denied spreading lies on foreign radios during the meeting, an 
allegation made against him by the RPA delegation. He also 
denied disclosing the contents of the negotiations, which is 
also not allowed. 
  The meeting will resume on Monday, 13 June 1994.

<F P=106> [Interview with interim President Theodore Sindikubwabo by </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Sindikubwabo] We tried to convey the fact that the 
RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front], which has attacked Rwanda is 
supported by foreign powers, by a neighboring country, namely 
Uganda. We want this to be clear and the African countries or 
other people who want to know the truth to realize that, without 
Uganda, without the support, material help, and the contribution 
of men from Uganda, the RPF would not exist any longer. 
  [Correspondent] However, President Museveni is not mentioned 
in this declaration. 
  [Sindikubwabo] We are used to this type of behavior and, on 
this subject, on the subject of this cooperation, I would also 
like to be clear: We are not calling for the condemnation of 
President Museveni as such, we are calling for the condemnation 
of the actions that Uganda carries out when it arms our 
aggressors, when it supplies them with men because, if you 
remember correctly what President Museveni recently said one day 
in Oslo: He said that it was young Ugandans who were fighting 
with the RPF. 
  Is there further evidence? There is also further evidence -- 
our government filed a complaint with the UN Security Council 
and evidence was gathered. They now hold the following 
evidence: We have the identity cards of those Ugandans who have 
fallen on the battle field; Ugandan vehicles that have been 
seized on the front were seized by the Rwandan forces -- this is 
sufficient evidence. 
  [Correspondent] You came to Tunis via Zaire. You went via 
Goma. Have you met President Mobutu? 
  [Sindikubwabo] No, I met the prime minister. He has known 
the situation for a long time, since 1990. He knows what is 
happening in Rwanda. 
  [Correspondent] Do you intend to meet President Mobutu here? 
Do you intend to ask him for diplomatic help? For proud action? 
For help together with that of other heads of state? 
  [Sindikubwabo] I will ask what I will ask from other heads 
of 
state: What I will ask from other well-meaning people is more 
peace and truth; to have the international community know 
exactly what is happening in Rwanda, what the reasons behind 
this war are, who is fuelling this war, and to ask them to stop, 
so that the RPF can lay down their weapons, and so that we can 
meet around a table to start a dialogue. 
  [Correspondent] What stage have negotiations reached now? 
Which conditions should be met in order to put an end to the 
bloodbath which is taking place in Rwanda now, given that the 
two sides are still fighting? 
  [Sindikubwabo] We called for a cease-fire from the RPF and 
they refused to stop fighting. What we are calling for is a 
cease-fire so that we can -- not renegotiate, since negotiations 
are behind us -- but see what the stumbling blocks are. 
  [Correspondent] Should the transitional authorities, which 
were appointed at Arusha, be accepted by the RPF, would you be 
ready to leave power? 
  [Sindikubwabo] What we are ready to do is to respect the 
Arusha accords. There is a chapter on the sharing of power. We 
are ready to share. We agreed to do so, and we still agree to 
that. The RPF should not ask for the resignation of this 
government. We are not recognized by the RPF and we are not 
asking the RPF to recognize us. Has anyone recognized the RPF? 
They do not exist by law. We exist according to one law, our 
basic law.

  [Excerpts] The session of OAU foreign ministers ended its 
proceedings last night, a day after the scheduled date of 
closure. [passage omitted] 
  From the very beginning of the proceedings until they ended 
last night, the Rwandan crisis was touched on more and more 
prominently with lengthy discussions resulting in the creation 
of a commission in charge of the Rwandan issue. [passage omitted] 
  The last conclusion and the most astonishing of all was that 
none of Rwanda's neighboring countries so far had been involved 
in the massacres. Alright, this is true. But when they say 
that neither of the warring sides in Rwanda was involved in this 
crime against humanity, this is truly astonishing. It is 
difficult to believe that the OAU was unaware of the role played 
by the Rwandan Government clique in the genocide through its 
army rabble and its militiamen. But given that the proposal for 
creating courts to try those responsible has been approved, let 
us hope that this means the judiciary is aware that there are 
criminals somewhere.

candidates--seven candidates have presented themselves for 
election as prime minister of the transition. Of these seven 
candidates, the name of Etienne Tshisekedi wa Mulumba does not 
appear on the list. All candidates were given 48 hours from 11 
June to campaign for their election. The elections themselves 
will take place tomorrow, 13 June 1994, at the level of the High 
Council of the Republic, the transitional parliament, which will 
hold a collective plenary session (?for) the seven [word 
indistinct] candidates from the moderate opposition.

  [Text] There have been some difficulties for a well known 
member of the opposition in Zaire: Etienne Tshisekedi, head of 
the radical opposition who was once prime minister and who 
considers himself still to be so, was held for questioning for 
several hours yesterday afternoon by soldiers of the Special 
Presidential Division. Muriel Pomponne has the details: 
  [Pomponne] Yes, at about 1600 yesterday, Etienne Tshisekedi 
was taken in for questioning by members of the Special 
Presidential Division, when he was travelling by car with three 
bodyguards and a driver on the N'Sele road, in the suburbs of 
Kinshasa. According to the representative of the UDPS [Union 
for Democracy and Social Progress], Etienne Tshisekedi's party, 
the four men were kidnapped and taken to (Kibomongo) camp, 60 km 
from Kinshasa. 
  The version given by Kibomongo camp's commander Colonel 
(Nsang Kiti Kumingama) is different: He claims that Mr. 
Tshisekedi was driving round inside the military area. He also 
says that weapons were found inside the car: one Uzi, one 
pistol, one grenade, and two cartridge clips are said to have 
been seized. 
  To the supporters of Etienne Tshisekedi, it was all a plot. 
In any case the former Zairean prime minister was questioned by 
soldiers and released late in the evening. But the UDPS says 
that the three people accompanying him are still being held. 
  Etienne Tshisekedi repeated to our AFP colleague that he had 
been the victim of a plot, but refused to make any other 
statement. 
  The affair happened the day before another test of strength 
between the opposition and the presidential group, since the 
presidential group intends to elect a new prime minister today.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 13 Jun (AFP) -- Etienne Tshisekedi, leader 
of the Zairian radical opposition, was released last night after 
he had been arrested in the afternoon while driving within the 
premises of the Kibomango military camp, about 60 km from 
Kinshasa. Joseph Mukendi, political adviser to the opposition 
leader, told AFP that Mr. Tshisekedi returned to his house 
yesterday at midnight. 
  Mr. Mukendi did not comment on the incident which led to Mr. 
Tshisekedi's arrest or talk about the circumstances under which 
Tshisekedi found himself inside the military premises. "For the 
moment, we are happy that he has returned home," he said. Mr. 
Tshisekedi told reporters yesterday afternoon: "I am a victim 
of a conspiracy here, and I won't say anything again." 
  According to the official version of the events as reported 
by Colonel Nsankete Kumimgama, commander of the Kibomango 
training camp of the Presidential Special Division, Mr. 
Tshisekedi, who was driving in a car with four people, sneaked 
into the military camp. Kibomango camp is near the road leading 
to the presidential estate at Nsele, east of Kinshasa. 
According to these sources, arms and ammunition including an 
Uzi rifle, a pistol, and two magazines were on board the vehicle. 
  Mr. Mukendi pointed out that Mr. Tshisekedi usually "takes a 
walk for health reasons every Sunday" on the Nsele road. "We 
cannot understand that people accompanying Mr. Tshisekedi with 
no military training should have weapons," he said.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] Point seven in the working agenda at the peace talks 
in Lusaka between the government and the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] to reestablish peace in 
Angola has been concluded. It was agreed that UNITA will occupy 
the 70 seats it has in parliament. There will be no 
replacements. Everything will be done in accordance with the 
law. There are deputies which UNITA will appoint to the 
government. (Joao Vaiken), from UNITA's negotiating team, could 
become the next minister of geology and mines, while Jaka Jamba 
could become minister of culture. These two names are contained 
in two lists that UNITA will present to its Political 
Commission, with a view to appointing its members to the 
government as part of the national reconciliation. The parties 
did not do any work here in Lusaka today. After concluding 
discussions on the swearing-in of UNITA deputies in Parliament 
yesterday, Alioune Blondin Beye sent the negotiating teams away 
to reflect on the next topic, the extension of the state 
administration throughout the national territory, to be 
discussed on 13 June.

  [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] said in the Zambian capital that it accepts the 
government offer on its participation in the country's 
government, but it stresses that it wants to govern Huambo 
Province. UNITA Information Secretary Jorge Valentim: 
  [Begin Valentim recording] We have received two documents 
from the mediators. The mediator gave us one document which is 
his own, dealing with four ministerial posts. We have accepted 
it. We have also accepted the following: seven deputy ministry 
posts, six ambassadorial posts, 30 district administrator posts, 
35 deputy district administrator posts, and 75 communal 
administrator posts. 
  With regard to provincial governments, the mediators 
proposed 
three provincial governors for us. We accepted that. We are 
only adding one more province, namely the province of Huambo. 
  With regard to UNITA's participation in district and 
communal 
administration, the government presented its stand. At the 
level of administrators, there is a lacuna of 10 administrators. 
The government left blank 10 district administrator posts. We 
intend to fill the posts in the interest of peace in Angola. 
The government also left blank 10 deputy district administrator 
posts and 30 communal administrator posts that we have decided 
to fill. 
  Taking into account our flexibility toward the documents 
presented by the mediators and the government, we think that we 
have found a common denominator to resolve the serious problem 
facing our country. It is our hope that the two parties's good 
will continues and that the supreme leaders of the two 
organizations will accede to the imperatives of history so that 
there can be peace and national reconciliation in our country.

  [Text] The latest government offer on the participation of 
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] 
in the country's government is final and nonnegotiable, Joao 
Lourenco, information secretary of the Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola [MPLA], said today. He was reacting to 
UNITA's position accepting the government's offer in general, 
while insisting on governing Huambo Province. 
  [Begin Lourenco recording] Our latest offer is final and 
nonnegotiable. Our offer to UNITA is in accordance with the 
proposal of the observers in the peace process. We offered 
UNITA the post of deputy governor of Huambo Province. This 
offer is nonnegotiable. As a matter of fact, the issue of 
UNITA's participation in the country's government has already 
been concluded. It is no longer being discussed. It is not on 
the negotiating table. On 13 June the two delegations will 
begin discussions on modalities to implement the extension of 
state administration throughout the national territory. [end 
recording] 
  Joao Lourenco decided not to make any predictions on the 
peace talks between the government and UNITA under way in Lusaka. 
  [Begin Lourenco recording] It is difficult to make any 
predictions because there are still issues to discuss; there are 
pending issues on the negotiating table. We do not know how 
long it will take to discuss them. Discussions on the extension 
of state administration could be difficult or easy. The 
principle is that the state authority should be extended 
throughout the national territory, from Cabinda to Cunene 
Provinces. We are going to see what UNITA's reaction will be -- 
whether or not it will show resistance. It is therefore 
extremely difficult to predict how the discussions will evolve.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Reports from Angola this week have indicated an 
intensification of fighting in the central highlands, especially 
around the government-held city of Kuito and at UNITA [National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola] rebel headquarters 
in Huambo. Meanwhile, talks in Lusaka, Zambia, seem to go on 
for ever. This week, the government offered UNITA a deal on 
posts in a future administration, but it seems the offer didn't 
include the governorship of Huambo, and UNITA has dug in its 
heels. Heba Saleh spoke to Deputy Foreign Minister Jorge 
Chikoty, currently in South Africa, and asked him whether the 
intensification of the government's campaign against UNITA 
reflected disillusionment with the talks. 
  [Begin recording] [Chikoty] I do not think that that is 
correct. What has been happening is that there has been more 
fighting in certain areas. You know, Kuito has been besieged 
for almost two years now. This is the same situation in 
Malanje. It is the same situation in many other areas. So, 
there has always been intense fighting in Angola. What we think 
is that maybe the government has now been responding a little 
bit more adequately to some of UNITA's moves. So, you cannot 
say....[changes thought] It is wrong to say that the government 
has intensified its campaign against UNITA. It is UNITA that 
has been in a campaign against the government for two years and 
we all know that. 
  [Saleh] But has the government still got any faith in the 
talks in Lusaka? 
  [Chikoty] Well, yes. We think that it all depends on UNITA 
to react. You know, we have made a considerable offer. We 
thought that the major problem until now was the fact we did not 
have a large participation of UNITA in the previous offers. 
Now, this has been done. So, we hope now that we shall be 
getting very close to conclusion in the next few weeks. That is 
what we think. 
  [Saleh] But I understand that UNITA has submitted certain 
proposals to the government side and that the government has 
rejected them? 
  [Chikoty] The problem is, you know, that we cannot play to a 
vicious circle where every time we make an offer to UNITA, UNITA 
will say: I am going to analyze that. Then they will choose a 
few points and say: We don't agree with this. Well, for 
example, we have offered a package, and I have heard that, well, 
they have accepted it, but they have also said that they wanted, 
for example, the province of Huambo as governor. So, in my 
view, that is a rejection. That means that UNITA has rejected 
the offer of the government. They either take the whole offer 
that the government has made rather than discuss on the point. 
We have made more than 200 offers to UNITA, if we take 
everything into account -- that is the ministry positions, the 
deputy ministry positions, the ambassadors, the deputy 
governors, the governors, the municipal governors, the deputy 
municipal governors, the communal governors. I mean, that is a 
lot. How will they just single out one aspect. 
  [Saleh] Why can't you give them control of Huambo? Huambo is 
very important to UNITA, and unless they regain control of 
Huambo, the war is going to go on. 
  [Chikoty] Do you think that is what the problem is? They 
have a vice governor there. They have a deputy municipal 
governor. What UNITA wants is to find points of antagonism. 
The other point is: We also don't think that after a party has 
won an election, it is the one that lost who makes the rules. 
In my view, the problem does not lie on one particular 
province. The problem is that UNITA is having a problem of 
accommodating itself within a democratic situation whereby 
everybody else will have to be equal. That is the problem. 
That is what we have to look at. [end recording]

  [Text] The fortress government of Jamba, which includes 
areas under the control of the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] in Cuando Cubango Province, today 
denounced the involvement of mercenaries whose nationalities 
have not been identified in an extended operation of the 
Government of the Republic of Angola jointly with the 
neighboring Republic of Namibia along the border, in the 
Caprivi-Mucusso strip. A press release issued by the fortress 
government says that Luanda was involved in the operations of 
various units led by Major Mario Antonio, an officer who had 
been part of the UN Transition Assistance Group during the 
Namibian elections. Major Mario Antonio has been assigned the 
mission of destabilizing Jamba, neutralizing Vorgan [Voice of 
Resistance of the Black Cockerel], UNITA's radio station, its 
leadership, and the governor of the fortress. A Cuban spy 
called Mariana Dirma, who had worked for the International 
Committee of the Red Cross during the Namibian elections, is 
also involved in the plot. The fortress government's document 
says that these personnel have assembled in the Mukwe area, 
which is located near Bagani, headquarters of the South African 
Army before Namibian independence. 
  We hereby inform the Angolan and international community 
that 
clashes may resume in the southeast of Angola, because this is 
the wish of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] and the South-West African People's 
Organization [SWAPO]. The communique, which appeals to both 
governments to assume their responsibilities, warns that should 
the clashes resume, the consequences will not only be felt 
exclusively in areas controlled by UNITA, but in the entire 
southern African region. 
  On the confused situation in the southeast of Angola, the 
press office of the fortress government based in Jamba yesterday 
once again accused the SWAPO-MPLA-PT of plotting to capture 
Angolan refugees residing in Namibia. The press office says 
that thousands of youths have been seized in Namibia and sent to 
training camps in Angola, in violation of 
internationally-recognized rights of the refugees. The fortress 
government urges the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to 
urgently inquiry about the situation which is still threatening 
thousands of Angolan families residing in Namibia and which puts 
at risk the constitution of that neighboring country. The 
seizures are being carried out by secret police agents assisted 
by elements of the Namibian Defense Forces who speak the local 
languages of Kwangar and Diriko. Vorgan contacted a source from 
the press office of the fortress government from whom it learned 
that UNITA has always favored and will continue favoring a 
policy of good neighborliness with all neighbors of Angola, 
searching to solve all differences which may subsequently emerge 
through dialogue. The source said UNITA will not fold its arms 
in case of aggression and that security measures have already 
been taken.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] On the preparations for the 
weekend, Sola Odunfa reports from Lagos: 
  [Begin Odunfa recording] The inspector general of police, 
Mr. Ibrahim Commassie, today warned Chief Moshood Abiola not to 
allow himself to be sworn in as president of Nigeria or to form 
a parallel government to that of General Sani Abacha. Mr. 
Commassie told a special press conference in Lagos this 
afternoon that if Chief Abiola went ahead with his plans, it 
would amount to an act of treason and he would be arrested and 
charged to court. Mr. Commassie, who is in Lagos to personally 
direct police operations against planned protest demonstrations 
by opponents of the government of Gen. Abacha, said that the 
security forces were well and fully prepared to deal with any 
persons who might try to foment trouble in the next few days. 
He described the prodemocracy activists as unpatriotic 
Nigerians and enemies of peace, who are seeking to take over 
power by creating a state of anarchy in the country. The law, 
he warned, has fangs for those who cross it. [end recording]

  [Text] Lagos, June 11 (AFP) -- Moshood Abiola, Nigeria's 
main opposition leader and presumed winner of a presidential 
election last year, was put under house arrest before dawn 
Saturday [11 June], a close aide told AFP. 
  About 20 riot police armed with assault rifles were deployed 
outside his home in Ikeja, a residential neighborhood to the 
north of the capital, and were blocking anyone from entering or 
leaving the premises. 
  Another 60 policemen and an armoured vehicle were stationed 
at the entrance to the road leading to the Moslem billionaire's 
residence, according to an AFP correspondent at the scene. The 
aide said he was put under arrest at 4:00 a.m. 
  About 100 Abiola supporters had gathered not far from the 
police cordon, the correspondent said, but there was no sign of 
unrest. 
  Police warned Abiola Friday that he would be arrested and 
charged with treason of he went ahead with a plan to set up a 
"government of national unity" on Sunday, anniversary of the 
June 12, 1993 presidential vote. 
  Last year's presidential poll was declared free and fair by 
international observers but annulled by then junta leader 
General Ibrahim Babangida, who alleged irregularities. 
  Babangida was succeeded by General Sunni Abacha, who seized 
power last November. Abacha meanwhile is to make a national 
address on radio early Sunday, his office said in Abuja. 
  Earlier Saturday a statement by the National Democratic 
Coalition, which heads the opposition, said Abiola has decided 
to put off forming a parallel government for "a few days." 
  The statement said his decision was in response to an urgent 
plea from the Anglican Archbishop of Nigeria and other 
opposition leaders hoping to reach a last-minute compromise with 
the military regime.

  [Text] Lagos, June 11 (AFP) -- Nigerian police Saturday [11 
June] closed down the Concord press group, owned by Chief 
Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of last June's presidential 
election who earlier in the day was placed under house arrest. 
  Around 80 policemen armed with assault rifles burst into the 
group's premises in the northern suburb of Ikeja and ordered all 
personnel out of the offices and cut off all access to the 
building, an AFP correspondent at the scene reported. 
  The Concord, the group's flagship daily, has stepped up its 
criticism of Nigeria's military regime over the past week, 
calling for the restoration of democracy and the formation of a 
government of national unity under Abiola. 
  The millionaire businessman, widely seen as having won the 
presidential poll on June 12, 1993 that was subsequently 
annulled by the regime of General Ibrahim Babangida, was 
preparing to declare an alternative government when he was 
placed under house arrest early Saturday morning. 
  The Concord group comprises around a dozen publications.

  [Excerpts] Lagos, June 11 (AFP) -- Members of Nigeria's 
opposition Saturday [11 June] moved to seek a compromise with 
the country's military rulers after Moshood Abiola, the presumed 
winner of Nigeria's presidential poll a year ago, was put under 
house arrest before he could declare a rebel government. 
  Abiola, Nigeria's main opposition leader, had been 
threatened 
with arrest on charges of treason if he went ahead with a plan 
to set up a "government of national unity" Sunday, anniversary 
of the June 12, 1993 election that he was widely seen as having 
won by a large majority. [passage omitted] 
  There were few signs of tension, however, in downtown Lagos, 
48 hours before the start of a week of civil disobedience called 
for by Campaign for Democracy militants in the opposition. 
  Last year's poll was declared free and fair by international 
observers but annulled by then junta leader General Ibrahim 
Babangida, who alleged irregularities. Babangida was succeeded 
by an interim civilian administration, which gave way to General 
Sani Abacha who seized power last November. Abacha meanwhile is 
to make a national address on radio early Sunday, his office 
said in Abuja. [passage omitted] According to Abacha's office, 
the general was to give a broadcast address to the nation Sunday 
on the situation. 
  On Friday, head of police Alhaji Ibrahim Coomassie said the 
security forces were ready to confront any eventuality. 
  Nigeria's Anglican archbishop, Abiodun Adetiloye, who 
fronted 
moves to persuade Abiola to delay naming a government for a few 
days, called on the present leadership and the opposition to 
engage in dialogue to resolve the crisis. 
  In a message to General Abacha, the fourth in recent weeks, 
the archbishop called on the military leader to choose to adopt 
an honourable transition of power to the "democratically 
elected" government of Abiola and avoid a tragedy similar to the 
one in Rwanda. 
  On Friday, Nigerian television broadcast powerful pictures 
of 
the Rwandan civil war and called on Nigerians to "help the 
government preserve peace." [passage omitted] 
  Archbishop Aditiloye, who heads a church which has 10 
million 
followers in Nigeria, said prayers would be said Sunday for the 
"peaceful restoration" of democracy. 
  The country's two most influential dailies, the DAILY TIMES 
and THE GUARDIAN, both appealed to the government in editorials 
to hold a dialogue with the opposition and also condemned the 
arrest of leading public figures by the police, including chief 
and former minister Anthony Enahoro, 71, one of the father's of 
Nigerian independence.

  [Text] The Nigeria Police Force has declared Chief Moshood 
Abiola wanted, and has asked anyone who knows his whereabouts to 
volunteer such information to the police or any security agency 
nearest to him as a matter of urgency. 
  In a statement signed in Lagos this evening by the force 
public relations officer, Superintendent (Sebanas Yo), the 
police said it was established that the activities of Chief 
Abiola and his supporters transcend the political quest for the 
actualization of the June 12 mandate. The police said it 
believed the activities of Chief Abiola stem from well laid down 
plans to cause public disorder and forceful overthrow of the 
Federal Military Government. 
  The police also said it has established that the activities 
enjoy the tacit support of and have linkages to some foreign 
missions in Lagos. The police statement said certain press 
premises which are suspected to be storing some arms as part of 
a grand design to force a change of government are now being 
investigated. The police said efforts made invite Chief Abiola 
to clarify issues on current investigations have failed as he 
has refused to give himself up for interrogation.

  [Text] Lagos, June 12 (AFP) -- Moshood Abiola, the Nigerian 
opposition figure who proclaimed himself president Saturday [11 
June] a year after the cancellation of his apparent electoral 
victory, announced he had named a government in defiance of the 
country's military leaders. 
  "From this moment, a new government of national unity is in 
power throughout the length and breadth of the federal Republic 
of Nigeria, led by me...as president and commander-in-chief," 
Abiola told a crowd of nearly three thousand people at a 
clandestine meeting. 
  A copy of the speech was obtained by AFP during Saturday 
night. 
  "My government of national unity is the only legitimate 
constituted authority in the federal Republic of Nigeria, as of 
now." 
  He provided no details on the government's composition but 
said that from now on all democratic institutions dissolved by 
military ruler General Sani Abacha after he seized power in 
November had been re-established. 
  "I call on the usurper, General Sani Abacha, to announce his 
resignation forthwith, together with the rest of his illegal 
ruling council. 
  "We are prepared to enter into negotiations with them to 
work 
out the mechanics for a smooth transfer of power. I pledge that 
if they hand over quietly they will be retired with all their 
entitlements and their positions will be accorded all the 
respect due to them."

  [Text] Lagos, June 12 (AFP) -- Police mounted a checkpoint 
on a road leading to a number of foreign missions Sunday [12 
June], after alleging that "a certain foreign mission" was 
linked with fugitive opposition leader Mashood Abiola. 
  A small number of armed policemen were posted at the 
entrance 
to Eleke Crescent after police offered a reward for the arrest 
of Abiola, who fled house arrest Saturday. 
  The Moslem millionaire, the presumed winner of annulled 
presidential elections last June, has declared a rival 
government of national unity and proclaimed himself president. 
  The road on which police were posted leads to the diplomatic 
missions of the United States, Britain, Italy, Denmark, Germany, 
Sweden, Russia, India, Bulgaria and Finland, as well as their 
associated residences. 
  Passengers and drivers were questioned about the missions to 
which they were heading. 
  Earlier a police statement reported on radio said that "it 
has been established that the activities have enjoyed the tacit 
support and linkages to a certain foreign mission in Lagos." 
  Officials have offered a 60,000 naira (2,700 dollar) reward 
for information leading to Abiola's arrest, national television 
earlier reported. 
  In a nationwide broadcast Sunday, military leader General 
Sani Abacha expressed hope that the international community 
"will do nothing to encourage the idle dream of some 
self-seeking individuals or the parochial interest of a small 
opportunistic group within our society who are bent on acts of 
destabilisation under various covers."

  [Excerpt] Lagos, June 12 (AFP) -- Nigerian police Sunday 
[12 June] ended a siege of the residence of Chief Moshood 
Abiola, hours after he slipped their net, proclaimed himself 
president and declared a parallel government. 
  A group of about 100 anti-riot policemen, armed with guns 
and 
tear gas cannisters, sealed off Abiola's residence Saturday, 
placed him under house arrest and stationed a police armoured 
vehicle in front of the entrance. 
  On Sunday, they lifted the siege, hours after he left the 
house for a venue in central Lagos where he made his 
declarations before disappearing into hiding. 
  Abiola, a millionaire Yoruba politician, is the presumed 
winner of Nigerian presidential elections in June last year. 
The military regime of then president Ibrahim Babangida 
cancelled publication of the election results and installed a 
hand-picked civilian government. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Nigeria Police has offered a cash reward of 
50,000 naira for anyone who offers information that will lead to 
the arrest of Chief M.K.O. Abiola. The police declared Chief 
Abiola wanted on Saturday [11 June] and asked anyone with 
information about his whereabouts to give such information to 
the nearest police station or security agency. 
  A statement by the police in Lagos said that it has been 
established that the activities of Chief Abiola and his clique 
transcended the quest for the actualization of the 12 June 
phenomenon. The police stated that the activities included well 
laid down plans to cause public disorder, breakdown of law and 
order, and forceful overthrow of the Federal Military 
Government. It added that their activities had enjoyed the tacit 
support of linkages of some foreign missions in Lagos. The 
police said all efforts made to invite Chief M.K.O. Abiola to 
clarify issues on current investigations had failed. It also 
said that investigations are being conducted in the premises of 
some media houses suspected to be storing some arms as part of a 
grand design to force a change of government.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] The newspapers give full attention to political 
events in Nigeria. THE GUARDIAN reports in its main headline 
that suspense mounts as the police intensifies search for 
Abiola. It relates this uncertainty to Chief M.K.O. Abiola who 
is reported by some media houses to have declared himself 
president of Nigeria at a Lagos suburb on Saturday [11 June]. 
Based on this, THE GUARDIAN reports that the police has 
declared Chief Abiola wanted, with a 50,000- naira reward for 
any information leading to his arrest, as the declaration 
amounts to illegality. 
  On public reaction to the latest development since 
yesterday, 
the paper says it ranged between reticence and cautious support 
for the pro-democracy cause. THE GUARDIAN further reports that 
some leading members of the National Democratic Coalition, 
NADECO, have called for dialogue as a means of resolving the 
current political situation in Nigeria. It names the former 
governor of Ondo State, Chief Michael Ajasin and Alhaji Balarabe 
Musa, one time governor of Kaduna State of Nigeria, as calling 
on the military government to have talks with pro-democracy 
agents in the country. 
  THE GUARDIAN also reports that the two chapters of the 
Nigerian Union of Journalists, NUJ -- Oyo and Lagos States -- 
have criticized the Federal Government for closing down two 
newspaper houses, the CONCORD press and THE PUNCH, in the wake 
of the political development. The paper quotes the NUJ as 
stating that it will go to court to contest the closure of the 
media houses. 
  The HERALD and the SKETCH also report on the political 
situation in the country.

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by Head of State General Sani Abacha </F>
on the anniversary of the annulled 12 June 1993 elections; place 
and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Fellow Nigerians, on Thursday, 18 November 1993, in 
my maiden national broadcast, I referred to what had become 
obvious to every concerned Nigerian. Our beloved country was 
adrift, threatened with imminent anarchy and disintegration. 
Some component parts of the nation threatened secession. 
Critical elements within the society openly invited the Armed 
Forces to intervene to secure the territorial integrity and 
sovereignty of the Nigerian state and to stem the tide of 
dangerous national descent into chaos and disorder. 
  As a result of this nationwide concern about the state of 
our 
country and following intensive consultation with a wide range 
of interests, including the principal actors of the 12 June 
crisis, the Armed Forces, along with other patriotic Nigerians, 
took the initiative of (?devising) a way forward by forming a 
government of a grand national coalition. To facilitate 
reconciliation, this coalition comprised eminent political 
leaders from all shades of political opinion. It is, therefore, 
clear that this administration came in to perform a mission of 
national salvation. 
  Fellow Nigerians, we have undertaken to lay a solid 
foundation for the growth of genuine democracy in our country. 
This is the agenda of our administration. We are determined to 
accomplish this historic task firmly, objectively, decisively, 
and with all sincerity of purpose. Guided by mature advice from 
the best political insides available in the country, we 
considered all options that could move the nation forward. Some 
of the options were practical but undemocratic. Others were 
emotional, among a vocal few, but not practicable. 
  After exhaustive appraisal of all the options, we recognized 
as our best choice the convention of the constitutional 
conference. The constitutional conference is an opportunity for 
the duly elected of representatives of all Nigerians to come 
together for unfettered national dialogue and discussions on a 
wide spectrum of issues confronting us as a nation. I have 
already signed into law the decree establishing the conference. 
On 27 June, I shall inaugurate the constitutional conference. 
  The conference agenda has been derived from more than 1,000 
memoranda received from individuals and groups from all strata 
of our society across the length and breadth of this country. 
Let me state categorically our firm determination to see to the 
successful implementation of the program towards democratization. 
  We must warn that our pursuit of this noble objective is 
unequivocal and cannot be compromised. Therefore, those 
elements in our society engaged in acts of confrontation, 
sabotage, rumor mongering, false alarm, and distortion of facts 
must bear in mind the full consequences of their acts of 
disservice to the nation. They must also be prepared to face the 
full force of the law of the land. 
  This country is greater than any individual or group. No 
individual or group will be permitted to hold this country to 
ransom. We have had enough and we have seen enough. All 
well-meaning Nigerians condemn the attempt of some individuals 
and groups seeking to translate their personal ambition into a 
national trauma. It is clear that the constitutional conference 
would afford any group or individual with genuine grievances 
ample opportunity to discuss them. Choosing the path of 
confrontation and subversion at this time of our national 
history would not be tolerated. Such acts would be sternly 
punished. 
  We acknowledge the interest demonstrated by the 
international 
community concerning our great nation. We know most of you are 
doing so with very good intentions. We urge you to continue to 
appreciate fully the magnitude of our problems and give support 
to our determination and courage to grapple with them. We, 
indeed, hope that in the true spirit of our national interest 
you should do nothing to encourage the idle dreams of 
self-seeking individuals or the parochial interests of small 
opportunistic groups within our society who are bent on acts of 
destabilization under various covers. 
  This administration appreciates the political and economic 
crises confronting us today but we are determined to contain and 
control their painful effects on our people. Indeed, the 
economic policy of this administration has been realistic in 
appraising both the depth of the crisis as well as in offering 
genuine short- and long-term solutions. 
  Fellow Nigerians, this administration has a solemn 
responsibility to maintain the corporate existence of Nigeria. 
We have a responsibility to achieve this objective through the 
enthronement of the principle of justice, equity, and fair play. 
Our mission is to ensure that we establish a very enduring 
democratic base that will form the bedrock for a sustainable, 
nationally acceptable governance for our nation. We enjoin all 
patriotic Nigerians to participate in this great national 
endeavor. 
  Government wishes to thank all our citizens for their 
patience and show of understanding at this critical moment of 
our history. We ask all members of our society to continue to be 
peaceful and law-abiding. This administration wishes to 
reassure everybody of our commitment and determination to 
protect all lives and property. Long live the Federal Republic 
of Nigeria! Thank you.

Osoba, former governor of Ogun State. He was charged and let 
out on bail. Robin White asked him what conditions were like in 
jail: 
  [Begin recording] [Osoba] It was most horrifying, most 
terrible. I think the authorities set out to deliberately 
inflict mental and psychological torture on me. 
  [White] Why? What did they do? 
  [Osoba] They kept us...[pauses] particularly myself for five 
days alone incommunicado in an office which is terrible, dirty, 
and without adequate ventilation,and a place infested with giant 
mosquitoes and very robust rats. I was made to sleep on a desk 
for six days. 
  [White] You say robust rats. What do you mean? 
  [Osoba] Well, at night my companions were rats, all roaming 
around the room, all over around the place. 
  [White] Were you interrogated? 
  [Oshoba] I was, and we were asked about the national 
democratic alliance that we form, NADECO [National Democratic 
Coalition]. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Another politician who seems to have disappeared is 
the former governor of Ogun State, Chief Segun Osoba. Chief 
Osoba, also a pro-democracy campaigner, was arrested just about 
a week ago and was released on bail on Friday [10 June] and was 
in fact interviewed on this program on the very day. Well, 
since then, nothing has been heard of Chief Osoba. This 
afternoon, Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka called us up from Lagos 
to express concern about Chief Osoba's whereabouts. Alice 
Martin asked him what he had to say. 
  [Begin recording] [Soyinka] (?In fact,) I am speaking right 
from the sitting room of Chief Osoba's house in Lagos. I came 
down from Abeokuta just to discuss with him the latest 
developments, you know, Abiola's long expected announcement, and 
found the whole house in total chaos. The security people and, 
you know, police and soldiers, came in at 4 AM [0300 GMT] this 
morning demanding from Mrs. Osoba the whereabouts of her 
husband. And, she was forced to come down in her nightgown 
and.... [pauses] They searched everywhere -- toilets and so on 
-- this place is in total confusion. I have spoken to the wife 
and she said she has not even seen him since Friday. The long 
and short of it is, we are not even sure it is not a sinister 
game being played pretending not to know his whereabouts and 
just using that opportunity to harass the family. 
  [Martin] Where could he be? 
  [Soyinka] Well, we just don't know. You see, the problem now 
is that virtually we have various arms of security and military 
operating, you know, in total blind relation to one another, and 
it is quite possible that one of these [word indistinct] may 
have abducted him while the others are looking for him. We just 
don't know, the wife doesn't know. 
  [Martin] At the point that Chief Osoba was supposed to have 
disappeared, who was with him? 
  [Soyinka] Well, he left... [pauses] Well, let me try and get 
you a direct answer to that. Excuse me, Madam, Madam, when 
Segun disappeared, who was with him? Did he leave with his 
driver or was.... [pauses] Well, the wife wasn't in. He just 
went out and he hasn't been back since. She doesn't know. 
  [Martin] What is behind this? 
  [Soyinka] Well, I believe that it has to do with the fact 
that he was granted bail. I think what the military wanted was 
that they could hold all these people -- Ebute and the others -- 
in prolonged detention. But, in the case of Osoba, I also have 
a feeling that it has to do with the fact the legislators in 
Ogun took the lead among all the states in actually giving a 
quick notice to the military administrator. So, Osoba, sort of, 
has come in the frontline of the attention of the military and I 
think that is why he has been singled out for this persecution.

<F P=106> [Interview with Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and </F>
Libyan Foreign Minister 'Umar al-Muntasir by Fu'ad Abu-Mansur in 
Tunis on the "last day" of the OAU ministerial council meeting] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] 
  [Abu-Mansur] What is Egypt's position and stand amid the 
attempts to Arabize and internationalize the Yemeni crisis? 
  [Musa] What does the Arabization and internationalization of 
the crisis mean? Some people are fearful of these two words, 
and this means leaving things as they are and looking at the 
crisis with indifference. We urgently call for respecting the 
UN ceasefire resolution. The party that does not implement the 
ceasefire resolution will be violating international legitimacy. 
We were afraid of the Arabization or internationalization in 
the Gulf war and there are some now who want to do the same in a 
tacit attempt to let the blood flow. We reject this totally and 
reject this reasoning. 
  [Abu-Mansur] When will Egypt recognize the Democratic 
Republic in south Yemen? When will it recognize the secession? 
  [Musa] Egypt supports Arab and international legitimacy in 
this issue as in others. We support Yemeni unity. But this 
unity cannot be imposed and cannot be maintained through 
bloodshed. This is a clear stand and there is no need to 
elaborate further on it. 
  Libyan Foreign Minister 'Umar al-Muntasir replied to 
AL-ANWAR'S questions as follows: 
  [Abu-Mansur] Is the "Lockerbie" case included in the African 
summit's agenda? Are you seeking an African stand supporting 
your views as was the case, for example, with the Arab League? 
  [Al-Muntasir] The Lockerbie issue was raised at the 
committee 
level. We want the summit to issue a resolution supporting 
Libya as the Arab League and the Nonaligned Movement have done. 
We believe that merely holding the summit in fraternal Tunisia 
means a decision that supports our stand on the Lockerbie case 
and the decisions on extraditing the Libyans accused of 
exploding an American plane over Scotland several years ago. 
  [Abu-Mansur] What are the new factors and developments in 
the 
dispute between Libya and the three Western countries--the 
United States, France, and Britain? It has been reported that 
the issue is going around in a vicious circle. 
  [Al-Muntasir] We still hold that the Libyans are innocent. 
But we have agreed to have them tried in a neutral country or 
before the International Court of Justice in The Hague. We are 
expecting the OAU summit in Tunisia to issue a resolution 
backing Libya's demand, similar to the ones issued by the Arab 
League and the OAU. We are hoping for this, especially as 
Tunisia is hosting the summit. 
  [Abu-Mansur] What is the Libyan Jamahiriyah's stand on the 
Yemeni crisis? What solutions do you propose to stop the 
bloodshed? 
  [Al-Muntasir] We are now in an African forum and there is no 
scope for dealing with this issue. But in reply to your 
question, I say that we support Yemeni unity and Libya cannot 
support the south's secession from the north. Regarding the 
solution, we believe that it should be a Yemeni one in the first 
place because the dispute is an internal one. Officials there 
should find a solution that takes into account the Yemeni 
people's interests and responds to their aspirations and hopes. 
We in Libya believe that the Yemeni people cannot lean toward 
partition and fragmentation. We have conveyed our stand to the 
Yemeni brothers. 
  [Abu-Mansur] How do you assess the efforts to Arabize and 
internationalize the Yemeni crisis so as to contain the war and 
limit the losses caused by the bloody conflict, which is taking 
the form of a "scorched earth action?" 
  [Al-Muntasir] We in Libya reject the internationalization of 
the Yemeni crisis. 
  [Abu-Mansur] And the Arabization? What do you say to that? 
  [Al-Muntasir] We say: There is no power and might without 
God Almighty. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The 60th session of the OAU Ministerial Council 
entered its fifth day today. Almost all the points on the 
agenda have been discussed. Our camera was present at the news 
conference given by the session's official spokesman to 
representatives of Tunisian and foreign media. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The OAU Ministerial Council, in 
its plenary session, which started yesterday and continued 
through the night until 0100 today, discussed a number of issues 
related mainly to the Lockerbie affair and the developments of 
the conflict between the Libyan Jamahiriyah and a number of 
Western states. It also discussed the African states' stance 
regarding the results of the recent GATT talks, in addition to 
the discussion of the special report on Africa's participation 
in the world summit on social development that will be convened 
in the capital of Denmark in 1995. 
  The spokesman said that on the sidelines of the meetings, a 
special committee continued its efforts to bridge the gap 
between the parties to the conflict in Rwanda by meeting each 
party separately and listening to proposals of both the 
representatives of the Rwandan Government and the Rwandan 
National Front. The committee, the membership of which consists 
of Tunisia, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Zaire, Zambia and Kenya, 
held another meeting this morning to discus the proposals of 
both the parties. The formulating committee today started 
drafting the resolutions and recommendations which will be 
submitted to the Ministerial Council for approval. 
  In his reply to a question by a reporter, the session's 
official spokesman said the OAU Ministerial Council will 
conclude its meetings tomorrow evening. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report on interview with South African Foreign Minister </F>
Alfred Nzo by Gerald L'Ange in Tunis; date not given] 
  [Text] Tunis -- South Africa will not intervene 
unilaterally in political crises in Africa but will act in 
concert with regional and international organizations, according 
to Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo. 
  In an interview in Tunis, where he is attending the 
Organization of African Unity conference, Nzo confirmed that the 
Cabinet had decided to provide humanitarian assistance in 
Rwanda, but had not yet decided on the form it would take. The 
decision, he said, might be influenced by proposals emanating 
from the OAU conference, which might assign specific tasks to 
certain member states. The Minister said the types of 
assistance contemplated by South Africa included helping to ease 
the burden imposed on Tanzania's resources by the influx of 
thousands of refugees from Rwanda. This could include food and 
medical aid. 
  While South Africa was not ready to contribute to any 
international military force sent to enforce peace in Rwanda, it 
would inevitably become involved in such operations in future 
crises, he said. South Africa would, however, place much 
greater emphasis on mediation, recognising that peace could not 
be imposed from outside, as had been demonstrated in Somalia. 
  "That would be the ideal -- for African countries themselves 
to try to resolve their problems in an African way, which would 
mean that mediators should come from African countries. We have 
expert negotiators in our country who could very well be 
deployed to assist in negotiations." 
  Asked whether these negotiators might become involved in the 
Angola dispute, Nzo said this might happen if the Angolans 
wanted it. The recent upgrading of diplomatic relations between 
South Africa and Angola enhanced the opportunity to discuss the 
situation with Angolan government representatives. The contacts 
would not be with the MPLA government alone, however. "Unita 
[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] must not 
be made to feel that sides are being taken because that could 
produce an unfortunate result ...that would be 
counter-productive." 
  On the question of changing the nature and title of the 
Frontline states now that confrontation with South Africa was no 
longer necessary, Nzo said exchanges were taking place at the 
OAU conference as a follow-up to the recent meeting of Frontline 
leaders in Harare, where agreement was reached in principle to 
the changes. Whatever body was set up in place of the Frontline 
states would be structured to deal primarily with regional 
co-operation on security matters. He believed that while the 
grouping should still be confined to southern African countries, 
it should be enlarged to bring in states like Swaziland and 
Lesotho. 
  He said no policy had yet been worked out by the Government 
on membership of or relations with the existing regional 
economic groupings: the Southern African Customs Union, the 
Southern African Development Community and the Preferential 
Tariff Agreement grouping. 
  Expressing his appreciation for the warm welcome given to 
South Africa at its first OAU conference, Nzo said he saw this 
not as a honeymoon that would fade but as a beginning that had 
to be consolidated. He rejected any concept of South Africa 
inevitably dominating its neighbours. "There must be relations 
of mutual benefit all the time. We want from the beginning to 
have relations based on trust, on total friendship." 
  Nzo confirmed that President Mandela would visit Morocco on 
his way to Tunisia for the OAU summit next week. The purpose 
was to complete talks that could not be finalised during his 
previous Moroccan visit.

  [Text] President Nelson Mandela has dampened expectations 
about South Africa's new role in Africa. Speaking on his 
arrival in Tunis for the OAU summit meeting, Mr. Mandela said 
South Africa's capabilities for meeting requests from other 
African countries were limited. He pointed out that the new 
government was still finding its feet. 
  Mr. Mandela's remarks coincided with reports that he is 
expected to play a key role in attempts to end the slaughter in 
Rwanda. The three-day summit meeting is expected to be 
dominated by the Rwandan question. Other issues expected to be 
discussed by the leaders of the 53 member states are Africa's 
enormous debt, ethnic conflict, religious tension, the rise of 
Islamic fundamentalism, and the failure of economic institutions 
in some regions. 
  President Mandela held talks with King Hassan of Morocco on 
his way to Tunis. He first visited Tunisia in 1962 to ask for 
MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] 
soldiers to be trained. 
  Earlier the OAU ministers conference decided to ask the UN 
to 
lift the sanctions imposed on Libya because of the Locherbie 
bomb blast. 
  South Africa's foreign minister, Alfred Nzo, attended the 
meeting for the first time.

  [Text] The African foreign ministers finished their work in 
Tunis this evening. They finalized 22 draft resolutions which 
will be submitted to the heads of state by Monday. One of these 
texts, probably the most striking, calls for a return to peace 
in Rwanda. We shall come back to this later. [passage omitted] 
  Rwanda is the subject of a draft resolution. Dominique de 
Courcelles has read it: 
  [Begin Courcelles recording] The Council of Ministers 
strongly condemned the massacres and killings that are still 
being carried out in Rwanda and called for an immediate end to 
them. It added that this was a crime against humanity and 
called for the trial of those behind them in accordance with 
international law. It called for an immediate end to 
hostilities and the institution of a cease-fire. It called on 
the belligerents to put an end to any hatred propaganda through 
their media. 
  Finally, it asserted yet again that the Arusha peace accord 
was the basis for a lasting solution to the conflict. It was 
pleased to note that several African countries had promised to 
contribute troops to UNAMIR II [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] 
and had launched an appeal to the international community for 
financial and logistic help. It also called for urgent help for 
the refugees and displaced people. 
  As we can see, the tone of the declaration is firm. However, 
neither of the two sides and none of the neighboring countries 
has been singled out for being responsible for the crimes, the 
war or any involvement in the Rwandan tragedy. Dominique de 
Courcelles, Tunis, RFI. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Text of the OAU's draft resolution on the Palestinian </F>
issue, issued in Tunis on 12 June] 
  [Text] The following is the draft resolution on the 
Palestine issue: 
  The OAU [Organization of African Unity] Ministerial Council 
which held its 60th session in Tunis, in the Republic of 
Tunisia, from 6-11 June 1994, studied the report of the OAU 
secretary general on the issue of Palestine contained in 
Document 1835. 
  While it reminds of the related resolutions adopted by 
previous sessions of the Ministerial Council and conferences of 
heads of states and OAU governments concerning Palestine, and 
while it reminds of the legitimacy of the struggle of the 
Palestinian people, under the leadership of the PLO, its sole 
and legitimate representative, for recovering their occupied 
territory and practicing their national inalienable rights, 
including their right to return to their homeland, to 
self-determination, and to establish their independent state 
with Jerusalem its capital; while it reaffirms that reaching a 
just, comprehensive, and durable solution to the conflict in the 
Middle East and the Palestinian issue, which represents the core 
of the problem, will contribute to a great extent to 
consolidating international peace and security; while it 
welcomes the signing and start of implementation of the 
agreement on Declaration of Principles, which was signed by 
Israel and the PLO in Washington and Cairo regarding the special 
arrangements for Israeli withdrawal and setting up the 
Palestinian national authority with its transitional self 
government; it reaffirms the following: 
  1. It reaffirms all the previous resolutions and 
recommendations adopted by the sessions and conferences of heads 
of states and governments and the OAU Ministerial Council 
concerning the issue of Palestine. 
  2. It reaffirms that the Palestine issue is the core of the 
conflict in the Middle East and the establishment of a just, 
comprehensive, and durable peace in the region requires the 
following: 
  a) Israel's withdrawal from all the occupied Palestinian and 
Arab territories including Jerusalem, and the recognition of the 
national inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including 
their right to return, to self-determination, and to establish 
their independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its 
capital, in accordance with the related UN resolutions. 
  b) Israel stopping all acts of violence against the 
Palestinian people and the release of prisoners in accordance 
with the provisions of the fourth Geneva Agreement of 1949. 
  c) Considering Jerusalem as an indivisible part of the 
occupied Palestinian territory and that it has the same status 
as the remaining occupied territories, in accordance with the 
related UN Security Council's resolutions. 
  d) Stopping the building of Israeli settlements in the 
occupied Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem, disarming 
settlers and providing the necessary international guarantees on 
this issue, in implementation of the related UN resolutions and 
in particular, UN Security Council Resolution 465, as these 
settlements constitute a factor complicating the peace process 
and impeding the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli 
agreement, and as a preliminary to their removal from all the 
occupied Palestinian territory. 
  e) Considering Israel's decision to annex Jerusalem and 
impose its laws and administration on it as an illegal and null 
and void decision and stressing the necessity for all states to 
avoid opening or transferring their embassies in Jerusalem, in 
accordance with the provisions of UN Security Council's 
Resolution 478/1980. 
  f) To link the various stages of the peace process so as to 
arrive at a final and a comprehensive settlement according to UN 
Security Council Resolutions No. 242 and 338 to affirm the right 
of the Palestinian people in practicing its sovereignty over its 
territories, water and natural resources, and its administration 
of its political and economic affairs in an absolute and total 
manner. 
  3. It reaffirms the necessity for solving the problem of the 
Palestinian refugees on the basis of human rights and according 
to the relevant rules and resolutions of the United Nations, and 
in particular, the General Assembly Resolution No. 194 and 
Security Council Resolution No. 237. 
  4. It expresses its appreciation for the efforts exerted by 
the Palestinian Liberation Organization in the bilateral and 
multilateral talks toward a just and peaceful settlement of the 
Palestinian issue. 
  5. It expresses its support and endorsement of the 
Declaration of Principles signed in Washington on the 13 
September 1993 by Israel and the Palestinian Liberation 
Organization, and also the accord signed by them in Cairo on the 
4 May 1994 concerning the Israeli withdrawal and the special 
arrangements of the Palestinian national authority and the 
setting up of its own transitional government, considering that 
an important initial step toward the application of the 
principle of Land for Peace that should be followed by urgent 
similar steps on the Palestinian track and all the other Arab 
tracks. 
  6. It calls on Israel to speed up the implementation of all 
the agreements it concluded with the Palestinian Liberation 
Organization in accordance with the time tables referred to in 
the Declaration of Principles signed in Washington, and the 
Cairo Accord signed on 4 May 1994. 
  7. It welcomes the formation of the Palestinian national 
authority and the Palestinian transitional self-rule government. 
It calls on all states and international organizations to lend 
a helping hand to it and help the Palestinian people build its 
infrastructure and develop its economy. 
  8. It asks the OAU secretary general to follow up the 
developments concerning the question of Palestine and to submit 
a report in that respect to the coming session of the OAU 
Ministerial Council.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy President Thabo Mbeki by Shaun </F>
Johnson and Kaizer Nyatsumba in Pretoria; date not given] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  On how the new Cabinet is working together. </H5>
  One of the most important processes that has taken place 
since this Cabinet was formed was the discussion and the inputs 
with regard to the president's state of the nation address. It 
was an important moment because here you have three different 
parties within the Cabinet, the result of the particular contest 
of the election. And, for the first time, we all of us had to 
sit and say: Is there anything that binds us together sitting 
here? Is there a common basis on which we can operate as a 
Cabinet? We began to address the question: What is this 
Government of National Unity [GNU]? 
<H5>  On agreement so far in Cabinet. </H5>
  We have now, all of us, agreed that the country needs 
reconstruction and development, that you can't come into 
Government just to run a bureaucracy, to keep things ticking 
over. That if this GNU is to mean anything, it's got to have a 
visible effect. Everybody said fine, and then there was 
agreement on important detailed elements -- where the president 
said let's get these particular programmes going in the next 100 
days to signal a serious intent to change the country for the 
better. It gives everybody common purpose. That was the first 
test of the unity concept. 
<H5>  On his relationship with ministries. </H5>
  Every day I am in contact with a lot of the Ministers, not 
just ANC Ministers. A Minister might want a decision, and might 
call or send a note to say what do you think. And it is 
possible to judge and say it sounds right, or it doesn't sound 
right, because there is a broad framework. Ministers have no 
problem with that contact regardless of the parties to which 
they belong. I think the relations are very good. I don't 
think anybody feels they are being used by another party. 
<H5>  On dealing with disagreements. </H5>
  Matters that could have been contentious have been dealt 
with 
in this co-operative spirit. For instance, the Ingonyama Trust 
business, the land issue. It was dealt with in a very open 
manner, no fights, and a quite serious intent to say this is 
what happened, let's go into it. Because we have a basic 
context, you can deal with the matter. It's not a case of one 
party getting advantaged or whatever. It's a question of 
whether we can sustain this decision, or not. I'm saying nobody 
feels threatened. Generally within the Cabinet, there's a great 
deal of co-operation. 
<H5>  On co-operation between ministries. </H5>
  Take the question of the release of children and juveniles, 
the amnesty question and so on. You would find the Minister of 
Justice, Dullar Omar, and the Minister of Correctional Services, 
Sipho Mzimela, dealing with it together a lot of the time -- one 
from the ANC, one from the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], working 
together very well, joint presentations to Cabinet and so on. I 
think the same is true of the relationship between the two 
deputy presidents. I've always had a good relationship with him 
(F.W. de Klerk) and that's not changed. 
<H5>  On how De Klerk is adjusting to his new role. </H5>
  I think he is adjusting. Clearly, you would not believe me 
if I said he was not conscious of having (formerly) been the 
leader -- of course he is -- but I think he accepts the fact 
that Nelson Mandela is president, with that constitutional role. 
But I think he also accepts that, apart from constitutions, 
this is the leader of this country in more ways than are defined 
on paper. He accepts that, and I think he accepts that he 
comes from a minority party. But of course you will see that 
he is in the process of adjustment. 
<H5>  On how Mangosuthu Buthelezi is adjusting to his new role. </H5>
  We sit next to each other in the Cabinet, so we are always 
whispering things to each other. I haven't had a sense of him 
needing to adjust as much as Mr de Klerk. He has walked in as a 
Cabinet Minister, he has his portfolio, and he behaves like all 
other Ministers. 
<H5>  On the new Government's priority. </H5>
  Underlying everything is actually changing the conditions of 
life of the people of the country, in every way. Whether in 
terms of providing jobs, clean water, better health, education 
and so on, this has to be the main thrust. 
<H5>  On the role of deputy presidents. </H5>
  We carry out tasks to assist the president. As of now we 
have a decision to establish at least three Cabinet committees, 
which will do a lot of preparatory work for Cabinet meetings. 
You've got a Cabinet committee, for instance, which will deal 
with security and intelligence matters, one which will deal with 
economic matters, another to deal with social and administrative 
questions. And the chairpersonship of those committees will be 
distributed between the president and his deputy presidents. 
<H5>  On the first and second deputy presidents. </H5>
  The constitution does not talk about first and second 
deputies, it talks about a deputy president from the majority 
party and a deputy president from the minority party. Clearly, 
in political terms, the deputy president from the majority party 
represents the majority. (President Mandela) uses the terms 
first and second deputies because that is the political reality, 
but the constitution does not say that. The constitution says 
that Cabinet meetings, in the absence of the president, would be 
chaired on an alternating basis by the deputies, but that is 
all it says. The rest is really up to the president to decide. 
<H5>  On Constand Viljoen's role until now. </H5>
  Constand Viljoen is an important political figure. We very 
deeply appreciated his courage in saying that to the extent that 
there was a peaceful constitutional way of addressing issues, 
that is the way they should go. We were sensitive to the fact 
that there were many people on the right wing who were very 
vocal, very threatening, who were putting on a lot of pressure 
to take another route. We thought it was an important act of 
statesmanship that he took the route he took. 
<H5>  On Viljoen's future role. </H5>
  We would want to respect the opinion he represents. It might 
not be massive in terms of numbers, but we would want to ensure 
that he plays his own role in terms of this making of the new 
South Africa. Sure, if they had had the numbers, it would have 
been very good to have him in the Cabinet. But the role of a 
Constand Viljoen, beyond what is provided for in the 
constitution, is something that must continue to receive some 
consideration. 
<H5>  On his own role in Cabinet appointments. </H5>
  The Cabinet was chosen by the president. There was a 
meeting, for instance, of the NEC [National Executive Committee] 
of the ANC just before the elections. It was agreed that the 
president would choose the Cabinet, and of course would consult 
as he wished. I know for a fact that he consulted many people 
-- the leadership of COSATU [Congress of South African Trade 
Unions], the SACP [South African Communist Party], individuals, 
myself as an individual. And in terms of the constitution he 
consulted De Klerk, Buthelezi and so on. There isn't any 
particular person -- certainly not me -- who was the determining 
factor in terms of the selection of the Cabinet and the deputy 
ministers. 
<H5>  On his view of the Cabinet. </H5>
  I think it's a very good Cabinet, and I personally don't 
agree with the criticisms of some people. If you take, for 
instance, the Foreign Minister (Alfred Nzo), if you look at the 
Cabinet as it stands now, you would find very few people who 
have had as much exposure in terms of foreign affairs as he has. 
You should look at his own history. 
<H5>  On rumours that he effectively runs the foreign ministry. </H5>
  No. I think it really wouldn't matter who had been appointed 
foreign minister -- we would have to come to their assistance. 
The fact of the matter is that I was in charge of the ANC's 
international relations for I don't know how many years, and 
therefore am most familiar with current foreign policy 
positions. It doesn't really matter who you would have chosen, 
the same thing would have happened. 
<H5>  On Cyril Ramaphosa's absence from the Cabinet. </H5>
  Well, for some time we had been discussing the possible 
impact of the election, the formation of a Government, 
Parliament, and all that, on the functioning of the ANC. There 
were three major deployments that had to be done. One to 
Parliament, Government and Cabinet. Another to the public 
service and the army. The third to the ANC. Clearly, all three 
areas were important. It is in that context that Cyril has been 
saying for quite some time that he thought, as secretary-general 
of the ANC, he needed to be among those people who would stay 
in the ANC and therefore not have any other responsibility. I 
have discussed the question with Cyril since the end of last 
year, when he raised it. And he persisted with that position, 
up to now. 
<H5>  On whether Ramaphosa's position might change. </H5>
  It's a continuing challenge. Personally, I have no role in 
deploying people. But I don't think this matter generally has 
been resolved in terms of the ANC. I think we have to continue 
looking at the question of that deployment, and might have 
indeed to redeploy people as we see what is happening. Whether 
out of Parliament to other positions, and so on. So it's a 
continuing responsibility. That kind of thing is going to 
happen, and I think we should read it straight, as it is. It is 
quite a challenge to the ANC. I'm personally quite convinced 
that in the whole process of making sure that we have rational 
and effective deployment of people, you make sure of effective 
participation in all three areas. You foresee certain things and 
prepare for them, but in the actual practice, as you begin to 
work, experience will tell you something. I would imagine 
personally that there will still be a shifting around of people. 
People could be redeployed. 
<H5>  On whether he now sees himself as heir-apparent to Mandela. </H5>
  No, no, no. You see, Nelson Mandela is president of the ANC 
and he is president of this country. That is all there is to 
this matter. 
<H5>  On how long the post-election honeymoon will last. </H5>
  I think the honeymoon arises from the expectation that 
things 
will change for the better. I think it's necessary and possible 
to sustain that optimism among people by actually bringing about 
that change. Its the urgent responsibility of the Government to 
show visible results. And I think we can and shall. People 
will begin to see movement as far as informal settlements are 
concerned, houses being built, children and expectant mothers 
getting free treatment in hospitals. I think things will happen 
-- they have to happen, to change the country for the better. 
I think that so long as the Government sticks to its promises 
in terms of that delivery, that mood of optimism will persist. 
This is not to say that there are not going to be hiccups and 
explosions, but there is so much that needs to be changed for 
the better -- and the potential for changing things for the 
better is so big that we ourselves have not even quite 
understood the potential energy that resides among our people, 
which will be set free by these changes. So I don't think we 
are in for a short honeymoon period -- unless the Government 
doesn't do its work. 
<H5>  On the controversy over politicians's salaries. </H5>
  The Melament Commission was set up by the TEC [Transitional 
Executive Committee] to look at the whole question, because 
there were no rules. At the end of this month, if there hadn't 
been something like this, none of the MPs would have been paid. 
So the Melament Commission was set up as a temporary emergency 
measure, and they've made their recommendations and also drafted 
a Bill to create a new salaries commission, remuneration 
commission, to look at the question again. So the Melament 
Commission recommendations are very temporary. What they have 
said will be replaced by what will come out of the other 
commission which will be appointed. 
<H5>  On the peaceful nature of the election and inauguration. </H5>
  We had been dealing with the potential for violence for 
quite 
some time. In 1986 I had a discussion with the-then chairman of 
the Broederbond, Mr de Lange. We have dealt with this matter 
with the IFP for a long time, and in discussions with the 
Afrikaner Volksfront. Even later than that, with the police. 
Three weeks before the elections senior police officers came to 
see me. I had wanted to see them also, and so we sat and 
discussed the need to secure the elections to make sure that 
there was no violence. We set up a joint task force which then 
met every day. So by the time we came to election day we were 
quite familiar with where the problems might come from. There 
was a danger that there might be an eruption somewhere, but I 
think the positions that were taken up by the Freedom Front and 
by the police (made a big difference).

  [Text] Armed villagers attacked soldiers near Burundi's 
capital, Bujumbura, and four people were killed when a grenade 
was thrown into a crowded cafe in the city. Reports said men 
armed with automatic weapons attacked the Army post in Kaidi at 
Nyambuye, 20 km from Bujumbura. Diplomats said the attackers 
had not been identified and the motives were unclear. The 
government had recently been conducting searches for illegal 
weapons, apparently fearing attacks on government forces. They 
had no information of casualties in the attack and official 
sources in Bujumbura declined to comment.

  [Text] In Lusaka, Zambia, the negotiators have reached an 
agreement on the swearing-in of deputies of the National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in the National 
Assembly. Tomorrow, the negotiating teams from the government 
and UNITA will continue the peace talks. They will discuss the 
extension of state administration throughout the national 
territory. Our correspondent Alves Antonio reports: 
  Negotiators from the government and UNITA have knocked down 
another obstacle. Tomorrow, they will hold discussions on the 
extension of the central state administration throughout the 
national territory. The representatives from the government and 
UNITA concluded early this evening discussions on the 
swearing-in of the deputies of Jonas Savimbi's organization in 
the National Assembly. The agreement's formulation has not been 
revealed and is at the present moment a great secret. All the 
same, Angola Radio National will continue its efforts to obtain 
more details on the agreement. It is already known, however, 
that UNITA deputies presently in parliament will continue in 
their posts, while the fate of those who abandoned the country 
and consequently the parliament will depend on a decision from 
the National Assembly itself. 
  Meanwhile, the negotiators from the government and UNITA 
will 
return to the Mulungushi Conference Center tomorrow to begin 
discussions on the extension of the central state administration 
throughout the national territory. 
  During the break today, the negotiators from the government 
and UNITA attended a reception hosted by the Portuguese Embassy 
in Lusaka on the occasion of Portugal's national day. The 
representatives from the government and UNITA surprised each and 
everyone present when they agreeably socialized as true 
gentlemen and brothers. Let us hope it was not just aimed at 
deceiving the public.

<F P=106> [By Jimmy Seepe] </F>
  [Excerpts] Government bureaucrats this week put the lid on 
any information relating to perks given to cabinet ministers. 
This comes at the time when discontent over the high benefits 
given to political appointees is a matter of heated debate. 
  NEW NATION's attempts this week to confirm the high grants 
and car allowances that ministers enjoy -- said to amount to 
R276,000 [rand] a year -- were met with deafening silence from 
government offices. 
  A reputable source in government told NEW NATION that 
cabinet 
ministers were offered various payments beyond their R30,000 
monthly salaries that included in addition to car allowances, 
R10,000 a month and extra cash to cover their telephone and fax 
bills -- and even their groceries. 
  The allowances have reportedly been accepted by three 
ministers, while others are said to be still unsure whether to 
accept the perks or refuse them. [passage omitted] 
  A clerk in the Ministry of Finance confirmed that ministers 
got a monthly allowance of R10,000, but when questioned further 
she said the matter was "classified information". She referred 
NEW NATION to the Public Service Commission (PSC), where 
attempts to speak to chairperson Dr Roe Venter proved fruitless. 
  A spokesman for the PSC, Corrie Smith, denied that 
ministers' 
allowances were dealt with by the department and said the PSC 
only "handled salaries of public servants and not political 
appointees (ministers)". 
  Efforts to get a response from President Nelson Mandela's 
spokesperson, Joe Netshitenzhe, also proved fruitless -- he was 
said to be out of the office. An official at the President's 
Office, Sakkie Olivier, told NEW NATION through a secretary that 
all inquiries about information on salaries should be referred 
to Netshitenzhe. 
  This week, the South African Communist Party (SACP) called 
for the reduction of salaries for members of Parliament as 
proposed by the Melamet Commission. The SACP's opposition to 
MP's salaries comes weeks after an ANC parliamentary caucus 
supported minimum salaries of R161,000 a year -- as proposed by 
the Melamet Commission. 
  The SACP said it believed that "in a country beset with 
enormous poverty, excessive salaries for elected public 
officials are simply unjustifiable. The gap between the lowest 
paid state employees and the highest paid is staggering".

<F P=106> [Article by Piet Muller] </F>
  [Excerpts] A lack of funds accounts for why the ANC is 
urgently looking for at least 500 posts for its officials in the 
civil service. After the election the party's funds are 
apparently running dry and other jobs must be found urgently for 
its officials. This week RAPPORT was alerted by informed sources 
that the ANC officials "will be in Pretoria soon." In civil 
service circles it is being described as "nepotism under the 
cloak of affirmative action." 
  State departments recently received orders from Minister of 
Public Services and Administration Dr. Zola Skweyiya to inform 
him -- before last week Friday -- which vacancies existed in 
their departments. Some departments had to work through 
Thursday night until the early hours of the morning to prepare 
their lists. 
  Over the past week the minister also issued a statement that 
approximately a thousand vacant posts in the civil service would 
be advertised by 15 June. A large number of these posts are 
senior management posts. The Transitional Executive Council has 
frozen these posts and have placed a moratorium on new 
appointments or promotions. 
<H5>  Posts `Multiplying' </H5>
  RAPPORT was informed that these 1,000 posts being sought for 
"affirmative action" had "multiplied to 3,000" by Friday. 
  There has been talk of an "undignified haste" and experts 
point out that the Civil Service Commission will complete its 
task within six weeks on the rationalization of the civil 
service from 11 services to just one service. It would have 
been more logical to halt the proposed appointments to these 
posts until this process has been completed. 
  Meanwhile, it appears that the various provincial 
governments 
are appointing new personnel left and right. These appointments 
could "lead to chaos" and even to serious tension between the 
black state officials and government. The interim constitution 
guarantees the job of every civil servant. They should, 
therefore, enjoy first preference with the appointment of new 
personnel, but the process could drag on until early next year 
before officials are fully integrated into the various 
provincial governments. At that stage officials might find 
their posts being filled by political appointments. 
<H5>  ANC Members Appointed </H5>
  In the Eastern Cape former ANC officials have already been 
appointed in all provincial state departments as "executive 
managers," apparently to promote the affirmative action program. 
Nobody knows exactly what their status is, not even whether they 
are just "embryonic directors general" who will later be 
appointed above other officials. Dr. Skweyiya says that these 
appointments are part of "temporary transitional measures made 
by the various governments. These appointments are not being 
done in accordance with the civil service rules and regulations. 
Neither I nor the Civil Service Commission are involved in 
these arrangements. It is not possible to speculate on the 
possible later inclusion of these officials in the civil 
service." 
  Also in the PWV Province "there are offices full of 
officials" who have been appointed in the interim. 
<H5>  `Old Extras' </H5>
  It was revealed to RAPPORT that there are "just more old 
extras" in the offices of the various premiers -- people who 
have come from somewhere and for whom posts will have to be 
created. "It seems that civil service regulations will not be 
followed in the new government. A moratorium on new 
appointments apparently does not exist any more." [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Durban June 11 SAPA -- Home Affairs Minister and 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] President Mangosuthu Buthelezi says 
he's vexed by alleged African National Congress attempts to 
drive a wedge between himself and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. 
Addressing thousands of IFP supporters at a "peace and victory" 
rally in Durban's Umlazi Township on Saturday [11 June], Mr 
Buthelezi said in spite of this there was no rift between 
himself and the monarch. But, he said, referring to recent ANC 
attempts to court the king, members of the Zulu royal family had 
succeeded in "step by step making the king beholden to the ANC". 
And he warned opponents and elements in the royal household 
that the IFP controlled the king's purse strings. 
  Mr Buthelezi said since the IFP election victory in 
KwaZulu/Natal, the ANC was determined to break Inkatha in its 
strongholds, and had tried to "ingratiate itself with his 
majesty". "One of the ways in which they are attempting to do so 
is to worm their way into the confidence of his majesty the king 
and the royal house." 
  The IFP leader claimed that wherever he went he heard 
rumblings from Zulu people about the extent to which members of 
the royal family had succeeded in assisting ANC attempts to woo 
the king, including "clandestine meetings" between the monarch 
and KwaZulu/Natal ANC leaders. "There are members of the royal 
family who are working hard to give the ANC what it wants -- an 
entry to the royal family and access to his majesty." 
  Among the "successes" of certain members of royalty, was to 
have King Zwelithini's bodyguards replaced by SA [South African] 
National Defence Force members, including perceived ANC 
soldiers. "No Zulu could ever have predicted, even a year ago, 
that it would be people perceived as MK (Umkhonto We Sizwe) 
[Spear of the Nation; ANC armed wing] who guard his majesty's 
safety in Nongoma." 
  Mr Buthelezi also said the ANC had "bandied about" promises 
to the king, but didn't specify them. 
  He said he had spent his political life committed to the 
Zulu 
king, and was responsible for "fighting the battles for his 
majesty to gain the elevated position that history has 
bequeathed to Zulu kings". Recently, he added, close to R7 
million [rand] had been spent on royal palaces, over R2 million 
on labourers, and R500,000 given to the king in farming 
assistance. "To date we have actually spent over R4 million on 
securing his majesty's personal position and on supplementary 
requirements around his person," he said. Mr Buthelezi said 
this was "the people's money...gladly spent", in favour of 
funding for schools, hospitals and health, because "Zulu people 
live for their king". But, he warned: "In future the very large 
budgets that his majesty will need for the maintenance of his 
courts and his kingly way of life, can only come from the 
KwaZulu/Natal Provincial Legislature, which the IFP controls". 
  The IFP leader emphasised there was no rift between himself 
and the king, but added that "from the looks of things, there 
are some mischief makers who are trying to brew something". 
  "I find it very vexing," Mr Buthelezi said, "and difficult 
to 
accept the fact that Natal leaders of the ANC are engaged in a 
game of creating a rift between me and his majesty. It is 
difficult for me to understand exactly what these ANC leaders in 
Natal are up to." 
  ANC leaders in KwaZulu/Natal could not immediately be 
reached 
to comment on the allegations. 
  It is understood that King Zwelithini recently missed an IFP 
election victory celebration in favour of a meeting with 
provincial ANC leaders. 
  Informed sources say that despite Mr Buthelezi's veiled 
threats, the king's budget is apparently controlled by President 
Nelson Mandela's office until provincial powers have been worked 
out, and even afterwards, the budget may still come from the 
national government. 
  Earlier on Saturday Mr Buthelezi congratulated about 4,000 
IFP supporters, gathered at Umlazi's King Zwelithini Stadium, 
for their election victory. But, he urged them to immediately 
press ahead and strengthen the IFP. He said the party should be 
prepared to fight an election before the government's five-year 
tenure was up. He predicted the ANC wouldn't be able to deliver 
its election promises and would "resort to calling a new 
election before the rot sets in too deeply to discredit them and 
to prejudice their chances of winning another election".

<F P=106> [By Dirk van Eeden] </F>
  [Text] The two former military undercover agents gagged 
this week by Defence Minister Joe Modise claim that top ANC 
officials were spies for the National Party [NP] government. 
Weeks ago the men told SUNDAY TIMES that among the ANC agents 
supplying information to them during the past decade were 
Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the National, MK; ANC military wing] 
officers earmarked for top positions in the integrated defence 
force. 
  The agents, Mr Gerhard Jansen van Rensburg and Mr Clive 
Brink, both former members of the disbanded Directorate of 
Covert Collection [DCC], are now barred by a Transvaal Supreme 
Court order from revealing the names. 
  Mr Modise's application was backed by a lengthy affidavit 
from defence force head General Georg Meiring, who said the 
disclosures of names of spies could lead to them being seen as 
traitors. 
  In the interview conducted in a Sandton hotel in April as 
part of a SUNDAY TIMES investigation, one agent said an ANC 
informant supplied them with details of a secret meeting between 
National Party and ANC negotiators in September 1992 on a farm 
in Ellisras. 
  Mr Jansen van Rensburg and Mr Brink were among 62 members of 
the DCC sacked after a Goldstone commission raid on their 
offices in November 1992. Amid allegations that this was the 
nerve centre of the "Third Force", 23 officers, including a 
general, were placed on compulsory early retirement by former 
State President F.W. De Klerk on December 19,1992. 
  Mr Jansen van Rensburg and Mr Brink said they feared for 
their lives. "We are terrified, not just for ourselves, but for 
our families. The problem is that all the DCC agents who were 
shafted know too much about top people." 
  In an affidavit supporting Mr Modise's urgent application, 
General Meiring said it was imperative that the agents be 
prevented from revealing "a great deal of top secret 
information...including the names of many informants" who could 
be severely compromised if their identities were revealed. 
  According to General Meiring's affidavit: "An interdict 
against them could save the state from severe embarrassment and 
avoid international repercussions." 
  Edyth Bulbring and Ray Hartley report that a besieged Mr 
Modise spent the anniversary of his first month in office 
yesterday with senior members of the ANC discussing his gaggling 
of the two agents and a bid to muzzle the WEEKLY MAIL newspaper 
over reports on the two agents. 
  A spokesman for President Mandela said Mr Modise would have 
to explain to the president why he acted in the way he did. He 
said he had been unable to discover who in the ANC had put out 
the statement condemning Mr Modise's actions. "There was 
absolute confusion as to who put it out," spokesman Parks 
Mankahlana said.

<F P=106> [Report by De Wet Potgieter] </F>
  [Text] Police are investigating a case involving more than 
15,000 European tourists who have entered the country over the 
past few months but have not yet left. They are apparently 
illegally in the country. This has led to rumors of secret 
plans to establish an underground "national army" of 
international freedom fighters, with close links to neo-Nazis, 
in South Africa. Concern has been expressed at the activities 
of Dutch citizens, Germans, and Croats, as well as the notorious 
far-right skinheads seen in the Transvaal rural areas. 
  A European organization Voorpost [Outpost], with its South 
African branch Voorpos, allegedly plays a role in recruiting 
members, as does the far-right Afrikaner Nasionaal-Sosialiste 
[Afrikaner National-Socialists] (ANS), in which Mrs. Monica 
Huggett is involved. The police have confirmed that Mrs. 
Huggett, a former member of the Wit Kommando [White Commando] 
and self-confessed member of the American Ku Klux Klan, met 
three Germans at the Jan Smuts Airport in January after their 
arrival from Europe and even gave them lodging for a while. 
  One of the Germans was later killed in a shoot-out with 
police and the other two were arrested. The former Vlakplaas 
commander, Lieutenant Colonel Eugene de Kock, currently in 
detention on charges relating to alleged Third Force activities, 
was present during the shoot-out outside Pretoria. He said in a 
statement to the police that his presence in the vicinity was a 
mere coincidence and thought at one stage that he was the one 
under attack. 
  Two New Zealand mercenaries in AWB [Afrikaner Resistance 
Movement] uniforms were also arrested in Johannesburg this week, 
carrying illegal weapons.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Civil Service Affirmative Action -- "The public service 
affirmative action programme announced on Wednesday by Minister 
Zola Skweyiya is a moderate plan," states the Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 10 June in a page-8 editorial. "With 
two related reservations that will need to be addressed, it 
looks like a careful attempt to build an appropriately balanced 
public service within a fiscally responsible framework." "The 
main criticism is Skweyiya's failure to acknowledge that the 
public service is simply too big." The second troublesome aspect 
is the decision "to introduce earnings parity in the former 
homelands. While the differentials had become a source of 
conflict, the new government may discover that taking the line 
of least resistance is not always the most appropriate 
response." The editorial does say, however, that in regard to 
the 1,000 new senior service posts "it is necessary that the 
racial and political imbalances at the top be remedied." In 
conclusion, the BUSINESS DAY warns that "the form the 
affirmative action programme takes is crucial. Competency 
cannot be sacrificed for the sake of achieving an acceptable 
racial balance." 
<H8>  NEW NATION </H8>
  Cabinet Salary Perks Criticized -- "Frugality will have to 
be 
the watchword of the democratic government as it begins to 
settle into office," begins the Johannesburg NEW NATION in 
English on 10 June in a page-8 editorial. "Everything must be 
done to make sure that the purse strings of the state treasury 
are sufficeinetly taut and so ensure that we direct as much of 
our resources into the process of reconstruction and 
development. We make this point against the background of 
concern in the democratic movement around the size of cabinet 
ministers' pay packets." The editorial recognizes the need to 
give ministers an adequate salary, but much of the problem 
surrounding this issue is "the secrecy that shrouds the size" of 
ministerial salaries. Transparency is important, the editorial 
stresses. "Secrecy will only serve to fuel speculation on the 
exact scale of benefits cabinet ministers are being paid. And 
this will not do any good for the moral leadership, which is as 
important as political leadership." "Without the necessary 
moral leadership, trust will fritter away. And that will not 
make for stable government."

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  WEEKEND STAR </H8>
  Better, Not Distorted, Public Service -- The Minister of 
Public Service has "tackled the task of revamping the public 
servce" by targeting "under-represented groups" for "immediate 
employment," an editorial in Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in 
English on 11-12 June on page 8 notes. However, increasing a 
service "already viewed as bloated by most people -- with 
another 1,000 posts" does not make "his reassurances that 
budgetary will not be exceeded" convincing. His statement that 
"while the new posts are aimed at under-presented groups, 
persons from `other groups' are welcome to apply...smacks of 
reverse discrimination....There is a real danger that the 
programme, unless carefully handled, will compound 
inefficiencies and lead to harmful discontent." 
<H8>  RAPPORT </H8>
  Affirmative Action Program -- "One of the worst forms of 
apartheid, race classification, has made its reappearance in an 
ironic manner, less than two years after the ANC-dominated 
government came into power. A comprehensive affirmative action 
system will be applied to the advantage of blacks in both the 
private and public sectors," begins a page-14 editorial in the 
Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 12 June. "So-called 
`monitoring mechanisms,' taking race and gender into account, 
will be put in place to ensure that the civil service reflects 
the composition of the population. This means the appointment 
of `race police' who will also peep over the shoulders of the 
financial institutions. They will have to ensure, for example, 
that black businesses and clients receive loans. Businesses who 
do not tackle `socially acceptable' projects will be forced to 
do so....The ANC government is impatient. Within six years, for 
example, the entire civil service must reflect the composition 
of the population. In certain cases this will happen within two 
years....This is a recipe for disaster. Equally disconcerting 
is the ANC's once hidden socialist program, which is suddenly 
becoming more visible. Its intention to interfere with the 
operation of financial institutions is a deliberate attempt to 
manipulate the laws governing the free market....This new type 
of discrimination is not just a case of two wrongs not making a 
right, it is clearly playing with fire." 
<H8>  SUNDAY TIMES </H8>
  Truth Commission -- "No matter what the Minister of Justice, 
Mr Dullah Omar, does about his truth commission, the search for 
the truth about the crimes of appartheid will go on," states an 
editorial in the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 12 June 
on page 20. "The question is not whether the truth must be made 
known, but how it must be made known, or if it becomes another 
mechanism (of the many!) to suppress the truth....Most recently, 
the luckless Defense Minister, Mr Joe Modise, was persuaded by 
the generals to try, by interdict and press gag, to prevent the 
publication of information that might cast light on the time of 
`dirty tricks.'...The first two waves of indemnity, which 
occurred in secrecy and amid the great confusion," released 
ordinary criminals and "cast no light on the past." There is a 
"suspicion" casting "a shadow over the question of 
reconciliation," whether some National Party or Cabinet members 
"had complicity" in crimes carried out by "instruments of 
apartheid repression." Two principles must guide the process of 
dealing with these suspicions: disclosure of the crime, but not 
a "Nuremberg trial" or "McCarthy-ite inquisition." "Those who 
seek indemnity must be assured of forgiveness if they specify 
their crimes; those who think they can conceal their past must 
run the risk that they will be exposed, sooner ot later, by the 
wider search for truth." 
<H8>  ILANGA </H8>
  Why not Ulundi -- Durban ILANGA in Zulu on 9-11 June in a 
page-6 editorial notes: "The issue of where the capital for 
KwaZulu/Natal should be seems to be generating a lot of heat 
under the collar among those who are opposed to Ulundi as a 
possibility....Our question is, what's so wrong with Ulundi, 
anyway? Isn't the ANC in the North-West Province working from 
the offices of the former government of Bophuthatswana? Isn't 
the ANC in the Eastern Cape Province is working from the offices 
of the former Ciskei government, with the province's premier, 
Mr. Raymond Mhlaba, even living in the same house occupied by 
former President Sebe and later by Brigadier Gqozo? When is the 
ANC going to stop speaking with a forked tongue?"

<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Minister Modise's Gagging of Newspaper -- "Strange, is it 
not, that within weeks of taking office, an ANC Minister should 
seek to gag a newspaper in precisely the same way as his 
Nationalist predecessors did," questions the Johannesburg THE 
STAR in English on 13 June in a page-10 editorial. "The 
interdict which Joe Modise sought last week against the WEEKLY 
MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN bore the hallmarks of many previous similar 
actions by the old regime -- obsessive secrecy over defence and 
a knee-jerk reaction to stop matters of legitimate public 
concern being aired." "We do not know the merits or demerits of 
the spies' case, and still less about the Minister's motives. 
What does not augur well is that the new Government should slip 
so easily into the ways of the old and trample so readily over 
the public's right to be informed." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Minister Modise's Gagging of Newspaper -- "The bid by 
Minister of Defence Mr Joe Modise to use apartheid's apparatus 
to muzzle a newspaper is deplorable," begins the Johannesburg 
SOWETAN in English on 13 June in a page-6 editorial. "It seemed 
rather odd when the former MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the 
Nation; ANC military wing] commander brought an interdict in the 
Supreme Court last week to prevent the WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN 
from publishing revelations by former CCB [Civil Cooperation 
Bureau] members. He was rightly condemned by his own party for 
seemingly attempting to cover up past covert operations of the 
SADF [South African Defense Force]." "We hope the ANC's 
criticism of Modise is a signal to other ministers that 
cover-ups and a lack of transparency in government will not be 
tolerated."

  [Text] Ghana has threatened to pull out of the African 
military force in Liberia unless that country's warring factions 
prove they want peace immediately. Ghana's foreign minister, 
Dr. Obed Asamoah who disclosed this in Tunis today, said the 
peacekeeping effort was a drain in the nation's resources. Dr. 
Asamoah said the renewed fighting has stopped disarmament of 
some 60,000 militiamen in the country and is threatening to 
delay elections which are planned for September. He said 
Nigeria and Tanzania are ready to pull out their troops within 
the month. Apart from Nigeria, Ghana is the second highest 
contributor to the peacekeeping mission in Liberia. Liberia 
will be the main topic at the OAU summit which opens in the 
Tunisian capital on Monday [13 June].

<F P=106> [Government communique issued in Bamako on 9 June -- read by </F>
announcer] 
  [Text] The Republic of Mali has, since independence on 22 
September 1960, always considered as one of its priority 
external policy issues, the safeguarding of international peace 
and security. For Mali, maintaining peace and security has no 
price because it is convinced that without peace and security 
there cannot be smooth development, an indispensable condition 
for the improvement of the living standards of our people. 
Based on this principle, our country has made every effort to 
make its modest contribution to peacekeeping operations in 
various African countries. Yesterday, it was in Congo -- now 
Zaire -- and today, it is in Liberia, Burundi, and Rwanda. 
  Confronted with the magnitude of that human tragedy, the UN 
Security Council in Resolution No. 918/1994 of 17 May, launched 
an appeal to the international community to bring the number of 
the soldiers of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda to 7,500. 
In line with the implementation of this resolution, the Malian 
Government has decided to send 150 men to Rwanda in addition to 
the 10 officers already present on the field. This 
contribution, although modest, concretizes our country's 
willingness to act in line with its international commitments 
and to express its solidarity with our Rwandan brothers. 
  Indeed, nothing can justify the genocide that is raging in 
that country and Africa's silence in the face of such a tragedy 
constitutes a dangerous precedent. Despite a difficult internal 
situation, we do not have the right to live in ostracism because 
we have to assume our historic mission in Africa and for the 
African people to the end.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Chief Abiola disappeared 
yesterday while under house arrest and the police are looking 
for him. Well, Fred Eno is a personal assistant to Chief Abiola 
and was with him when he gave security personnel, who had 
surrounded his house, the slip. On a mobile phone to Lagos, 
Mustapha Ibrahim asked Fred Eno how Chief Abiola had made his 
escape. 
  [Begin recording] [Eno] Well, they (?surrounded) the more 
obvious entries and exits of his house, but there are several 
other exits which apparently there was policeman there, so we 
used it. [sentence as heard] 
  [Ibrahim] Now, what sort of vehicles did you use when you 
left the house to go to your destination? 
  [Eno] We used one of his cars, a private car. 
  [Ibrahim] Where did the chief go next? 
  [Eno] He went straight to the venue where he made his 
declaration. 
  [Ibrahim] Where was this venue? Was it in Lagos or somewhere 
outside Lagos? 
  [Eno] Yes, it was on Lagos Island. It was at the Eleganza 
Plaza, at the sports center, and this was done at the back [word 
indistinct] yesterday in the evening. 
  [Ibrahim] Now, at that time of the night how was it possible 
that there were people at such a lonely place. 
  [Eno] We are used to that. We used to campaign during the 
whole night during campaigns. We used to campaign at 10, 11, 12 
o'clock at night, so I don't think there is a problem getting 
people there. Chief Abiola is not any other name in Nigeria.... 
  [Ibrahim, interrupting] How was the atmosphere? How many 
people were there? 
  [Eno] Electric, electric. By the time we got there the place 
was crowded and by the time word got out to... [pauses] There 
are markets and other place around there, so everybody in the 
market abandoned their wares and trooped down to the venue. 
  [Ibrahim] What exactly did he say in his speech.? 
  [Eno] It is an eight-page statement. I cannot release all of 
it to you right now, but I think he made the pertinent point in 
which he declared himself the president, considering his victory 
in the 1993 election and all the other democratic structures, 
particularly the Senate, which is going to reconvene and then 
consider his cabinet list, which still remains confidential. 
  [Ibrahim] So after this declaration, he left? 
  [Eno] Oh yes, we didn't stay there. We left.... 
  [Ibrahim, interrupting] And where is he now? 
  [Eno] And went back home, his home. 
  [Ibrahim] You came back to his home, but where is Chief 
Abiola himself? 
  [Eno] He is having meetings with other colleagues of his at 
different venues. 
  [Ibrahim] It is being alleged that Chief M.K.O. Abiola is 
hiding at one of the Western embassies and that he is going to 
seek recognition from these other countries. 
  [Eno] I will suggest you check that because it is not 
correct. 
  [Ibrahim] A price has been put on the chief's head. He has 
been declared wanted by the police, is he not going to give 
himself up? 
  [Eno] That is an abuse on the Nigerian people. You don't put 
a prize to somebody they elected to be their president. We have 
a due process in which he is going to take an oath of office, 
where he will be sworn in [word indistinct] a declaration 
accepting the mandate and considering himself the legitimate 
winner of the elections and the president of the Federal 
Republic of Nigeria. I don't think there is any controversy in 
that. 
  [Ibrahim] When is this going to take place? 
  [Eno] When the democratic structures go to ratify the entire 
process I will give you a program. [end recording]

  [Text] In Djibouti, official sources report that the 
government and the FRUD [Front for Restoration of Unity and 
Democracy] have agreed to end the fighting. That being said, 
negotiations for the FRUD were led by Ougoureh Kifle, whose 
legitimacy as secretary general of the movement is strongly 
disputed by many, and particularly by Ahmed Dini, the FRUD 
leader.

  [Excerpt] An assistant minister for planning and national 
development, Oduya Oprong, was last night shot twice in the head 
by unknown assailants who left him critically wounded. He was 
taken to Mater Misericordiae Hospital where he was briefly 
attended to before being rushed to Nairobi hospital where he was 
admitted in the hospital's intensive care unit. Sources at 
Nairobi Hospital told KTN this evening that there were two 
bullets lodged in the assistant minister's head but one had been 
removed. The sources, however could not confirm whether Oprong 
was out of danger or not. Family sources told KTN that the 
minister was shot at about 9.00 PM last night as he was driving 
from his Mariakani flat in Nairobi's South B area. Independent 
sources said there were two loud gunshots near the minister's 
compound moments before a relative rushed him to Mater 
Misericordiae hospital at about 9.30 PM. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In Tunis, Tanzania has said it intends to withdraw 
from the peacekeeping operation in Liberia next month because 
the United Nations has not implemented its accord with Tanzania. 
  Speaking to a nine-man ECOWAS [Economic Community of West 
African States] commission on Liberia, Tanzania's minister for 
foreign affairs, the Honorable Joseph Rwegasira, said the United 
Nations had not given Tanzania the finance to enable its troops 
in Liberia to undertake its role appropriately. Members of the 
Tanzania People's Defense Force are in Liberia for a six-month 
attachment which is due to expire next month. Rwegasira said 
the withdrawal of the Tanzanian troops from Liberia was a 
regrettable action, adding that it could not be determined in 
advance what effect the withdrawal would cause. 
  Meanwhile, Ghana and Nigeria have also threatened to pull 
out 
their peacekeeping forces from Liberia as a result of the rising 
cost of maintaining such forces in Liberia, and due to lack of 
progress in restoring peace in that country. Ghana has been 
facing a financial crisis for the last four years, in keeping 
its forces in Liberia.

<F P=106> [Speech by Egyptian President Muhammad Husni Mubarak at the </F>
opening session of the OAU summit in Tunis--live] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate: 
Brother heads of state and government, Your Excellencies heads 
of delegations, Mr. OAU secretary general, ladies and gentlemen: 
Let me convey to each of you the most sincere feelings of 
brotherhood and cordiality and express my pleasure at meeting 
with you once again as we work together to realize the hopes of 
our struggling African peoples to deepen the bonds of unity and 
solidarity among themselves and serve their legitimate 
objectives and highest ambitions for development, progress, and 
civilization. 
  It pleases me on this happy occasion--the opening of the 
30th 
African summit--to express warmest gratitude and appreciation to 
the fraternal people of Tunisia and their leader President Zine 
El Abidine Ben Ali for the hospitality they have accorded us and 
for their obvious eagerness to provide all the necessary 
requirements for the success of this conference. I am also 
pleased to express my complete confidence that the ability and 
wisdom of President Ben Ali will lead the OAU, at its 30th 
summit, in extensive work and great achievements. 
  Brothers and sisters: It is one of the greatest moments in 
the history of Africa and its organization to see the new South 
Africa, under dear brother President Nelson Mandela, join the 
independent and free countries that are working to advance the 
united African march. The people of South Africa were not 
absent from us and from the OAU. They have always been with us 
in their heroic and glorious struggle, through which they 
recorded a bright page in the history of humanity and 
strengthened man's confidence that truth, virtue, and justice 
must triumph over the forces of evil, darkness, and coercion. 
  Allow me to salute brother President Nelson Mandela once 
again and to congratulate him on the high confidence he won from 
the sons of his country, both the majority and the minority, and 
on the establishment of the first nonracist government, 
reflecting the united will of the entire nation, without 
discrimination. While we wish this historic experience in 
democratic transformation all success and prosperity, we hope it 
will become a model to be emulated, not only in Africa but 
throughout the other continents, where there is a pressing need 
for coexistence, dialogue, the renunciation of violence, and 
elimination of hatred and the spirit of contradiction and enmity. 
  Reconstruction is, and will always be, harder and more 
difficult than revolution and change. The task of 
reconstruction requires security and stability as well as the 
cooperation of everyone in the pursuit of the national goals of 
social and economic development. 
  The African nations, who have stood firmly behind the South 
African people during their struggle, are determined to maintain 
their solidarity with the South Africans in the reconstruction 
phase. The Africans will give their support to the brotherly 
South African people and help them assume their responsibility 
in this strategic part of our glorious continent. 
  Brothers and sisters, a year has passed since we last met in 
Cairo last June, a year that brought with it glimmers of hope 
for a better future. The past year saw continued efforts by the 
OAU leaders and peoples to confront the numerous problems facing 
our nations, which are and exhausting a large portion of our 
resources and potentials. 
  It is a regrettable and painful fact that many of these 
problems were caused by the Africans themselves. Therefore, the 
way to rid ourselves of the evils of war and destruction is 
something that we, not others, have to find. Making and 
preserving peace is our responsibility, not that of other 
international organizations and outside powers. 
  The OAU has taken a large and remarkable stride toward 
adopting preventive diplomacy as a way to avoid perils, foresee 
crises, and settle disputes. Among our accomplishments in the 
past year was the agreement by African leaders in Cairo OAU 
summit last June to set up a central mechanism of preventing, 
managing, and settling conflicts. This was followed by a meeting 
in Cairo last September at the level of heads of state. This 
meeting succeeded in formulating the principles and determining 
the framework for the mechanism's operation through its central 
body. 
  The OAU took this great achievement to a higher plateau with 
its decision to set up a peace fund to finance the mechanism's 
activities and enable it to deal effectively with a number of 
African problems. This will give the entire OAU the credibility 
it needs. There is a mounting international tendency to try to 
resolve disputes through regional organizations before resorting 
to external powers, the aim being to prevent these disputes from 
assuming an international dimension that might lead to further 
complications. 
  In order to preempt crises and curb fledgling disputes, an 
African minisummit was held in Harare in March, and it was a 
success. It involved in-depth discussions of the situation in 
South Africa on the eve of the elections that led to the birth 
of a new government. 
  Within this context, on the basis of experience and events, 
as I hand over the chairmanship of the OAU, I call for great 
attention to be paid in the coming period to preventive 
diplomacy and to establishing an early-warning system that 
anticipates disputes before they turn into military showdowns. 
The OAU Secretariat General must provide a data base for the 
current and expected disputes on the continent. 
  As we view this historic achievement, we must not forget 
that 
the wisdom of the leaders, the vigilance of the African people, 
and response of all forces to the call to discard violence and 
maintain the unity of South Africa resulted in the call I made 
in the name of the OAU to a number of heads of state and 
government in major Western capitals. This undoubtedly enabled 
the OAU to spare the people of South Africa further violence and 
confrontation and to maintain that country's unity and the 
integration of its components. 
  Brothers and sisters: Our African continent has adopted 
these two big steps, which are considered the most prominent 
indications of wisdom and political pragmatism, whether in 
achieving national detente through the democratic choice in 
South Africa or in maintaining unanimity in establishing a 
watertight system and a mechanism to settle its disputes by 
peaceful means. An our organization has taken a third daring 
step by its correct realization and understanding of the new 
economic facts of the modern world. 
  The organization discovered that the phenomenon of blocs, 
groupings, and mutual reliance is the hallmark of economic 
relations among the countries of the North, whether in Europe, 
North America, or the Asian Far East. Our organization felt the 
long-term effects of its relations with the states of the North 
and the sum total of international economic relations. From 
this premise, brothers and sisters, and realizing the need for 
integration between the North and South, right after our 
previous summit and in the name of all you, I addressed the 
leaders of the major industrial powers on the occasion of last 
July's Tokyo summit [of the G-7]. I explained the nature of the 
economic problems in Africa and submitted our just and realistic 
demands, especially the easing of the heavy burdens of our 
countries' debts within the framework of a relationship based on 
constructive dialogue and mutual understanding among the states 
of the North and South. Within the same framework, the brother 
leaders in Africa responded brilliantly--not only to the needs 
dictated by the international economic situation but also out of 
a real desire by the continent's states and peoples--when they 
each approved the African Economic Group agreement. Thus, the 
necessary approvals have been received for this important 
agreement to legally take effect. 
  With that, Africa will enter a new phase of integration 
involving its various economies. We hope that this integration 
will reflect positively on its relations and dialogue with the 
states of the North. We also hope that this integration will 
positively affect the development of its energies and wealth and 
will achieve higher growth rates and greater prosperity for the 
African nations. 
  I have no doubt that this accomplishment and the successful 
efforts of the African continent to forge ahead along this road 
will guarantee a good position for Africa on the world's 
economic map. They will also enable the African states to 
benefit from the various privileges of economic integration, 
such as lessening the cost of production, increasing the number 
of markets, and ensuring better transportation and communication 
facilities. Economic integration will also enable the continent 
to have negotiating power vis-a-vis the other world blocs. 
  Brothers and sisters, this step was very important for us in 
Africa after the introduction of the new GATT Agreement and the 
impending establishment of the World Trade Organization. These 
developments could bring positive and negative results that 
might affect the developing countries in general and the African 
states, which produce raw materials, in particular. Such 
developments could also dictate the lifting of restrictions and 
barriers hindering international trade, especially the exports 
of the advanced industrial countries. 
  Accordingly, the African Economic Group Agreement will 
provide a protective umbrella for our interests and a strong 
guarantee against any effects that could harm our economic 
conditions if we are not well prepared for it. What 
consolidates the role of this Economic Group and gives it 
impetus is that the Group's states agreed last year to establish 
the first African import-export bank. They also agreed on Cairo 
as site of the bank's headquarters. 
  We are also confident that this vital economic establishment 
will open up broad horizons for inter-African trade and will 
achieve the desired integration. It will also create new fields 
for balanced trade relations with the rest of the world. 
  We recorded undeniably positive aspects in the economic 
field 
thanks to a sound awareness of the economic facts and changes. 
We must never forget that advancing the wheel of economic 
development in Africa can only be achieved by effectively and 
wisely confronting Africa's chronic and persistent 
problems--drought and desertification and the accompanying 
famine and refugees. We witnessed one of its painful chapters 
in the Horn of Africa 10 years ago. 
  We must also not forget that pushing forward the wheel of 
economic development in Africa requires that we always maintain 
the delicate balance between population and resources or between 
land and people. No matter how great the resources, they are 
liable to be depleted due to the constant increase in 
population. This poses a social and economic challenge to the 
continent's people, who must face it with wisdom and reason. 
  Finally, we must not forget that economic growth cannot be 
achieved without a comprehensive and balanced infrastructure and 
without human development that raises the standard of the 
individual, maintains his dignity, and releases his potential 
and energy. I will continue to call for a climate of political 
and social security and stability as a necessary and vital need 
for the economic development process. Security is the main 
pillar of stability, and stability is the guarantee for the 
success of development. Africa urgently needs these three 
components together. 
  Brothers and sisters, Africa has emerged cohesive and strong 
from the era of colonialism and foreign domination. Its groups 
and tribes have coexisted as brothers and neighbors across 
borders and within the same homeland. Loyalty to the homeland 
has remained above any other loyalty. Our affiliation to the 
African continent and to its civilization and interests has 
superseded all other affiliations. Africa has respected its 
borders, enshrined its territorial unity and integrity, and 
safeguarded its states' sovereignty, independence, and freedom 
in accordance with its charter, which was adopted by its 
founding leaders 30 years ago. Therefore, the recent aspects of 
struggle that have divided the sons of the same homeland and 
threatened security and stability in some parts of the continent 
do not conform with the genuine African spirit. They must not 
be interpreted as representing an African phenomenon or a 
permanent fixture in Africa with which we have to coexist and 
accept as part of the new continental reality. On the contrary, 
it must be viewed as a passing and temporary phenomenon that 
does not conform with firm African traditions and does not agree 
with our long history and rich heritage. 
  An example of this deteriorating situation, on which we must 
not remain silent, is the situation in fraternal Somalia. 
Despite the honest and sincere efforts undertaken by 
neighboring countries, the OAU, the United Nations, and several 
friendly states, the Somali people continue to pay a heavy price 
for the power struggles and rivalries at the expense of the 
country's unity and its social fabric and at the expense of its 
stability and the security of its citizens. 
  I have taken it upon myself to do my utmost to put an end to 
this destructive crisis by virtue of my responsibility as OAU 
chairman and by virtue of my capacity as president of Egypt, 
which has strong historical and cultural relations with Somalia. 
  The efforts, which we coordinated with the brothers and 
presidents, who played a special role in this regard, focussed 
on closing ranks and calling on all factions without exception 
to agree to a national reconciliation formula. The efforts 
resulted in the issuance of the Cairo Declaration, which 
constituted a solid base and a common ground for all factions to 
get out of the current crisis. We are renewing our call to all 
sides to place Somalia above ambitions, and to restore unity to 
the country and security and reassurance to the people. We urge 
them to start a sincere and determined march toward unity and 
national reconciliation so that this fraternal country can 
continue its development and message. 
  If we are to learn a lesson from this tragedy, it is that 
Africa is most capable of solving its problems by itself. 
Assistance from friendly countries and international 
organizations, no matter how necessary, cannot replace the 
African role but only support it. The responsibility lies 
primarily with the people of Africa, because they know best the 
problems of their countries and societies. 
  In central Africa, that strategically important region 
thanks 
to its unique location where the great Nile starts and many 
friendly countries share borders, heavy blood was shed on the 
soil of two friendly countries, Rwanda and Burundi. The vicious 
fighting pained our hearts because it bordered on genocide, 
where hundreds of thousands of people were killed, resources 
that we urgently need were wasted, and hundreds of thousands of 
people were turned into refugees burdening the neighboring 
countries and depleting their resources, let alone the war's 
negative reflections on Africa's image and culture. 
  These tragic situations, brothers and sisters, place on the 
shoulders of our organization, the world community, and the 
United Nations a common humanitarian duty and a moral obligation 
to move to stop this bleeding so that its aftermath and 
consequences do not extend to the heart of the continent and to 
this spot, which is vital to its own peoples and to the 
neighboring peoples. 
  In Burundi, the OAU's swift moves to control the situation 
prevented further deterioration. These moves constituted one of 
the first successful trials of the conflict resolution mechanism 
which the OAU has established. The OAU envoy contacted all 
forces in the government and the opposition, and this set the 
appropriate stage for containing the situation and easing 
tension. 
  Another lesson to be learned from our experience in this 
central African region is that the presence of peace-keeping 
forces, although undeniably important, is not an alternative to 
a genuine peace among the sons of the nation, whether in the 
government or the opposition, within the framework of 
legitimacy, law, respect for man's dignity, and the use of the 
language of dialogue and reconciliation. 
  Perhaps the real dilemma facing African countries in 
certain areas is that of maintaining internal stability and 
national cohesion. Unity should be preserved through pluralism. 
The time is right for the OAU, with all its agencies, to turn 
its utmost attention to this issue, among others. 
  Against this background, the OAU continued its efforts to 
restore stability, consolidate national cohesion, and unify 
national forces in Angola, Liberia, and Mozambique. I had 
urgent exchanges with the influential forces in these countries 
with a view to probing the problems there and resolving them. 
  In the same context, the OAU is in touch with the brothers 
in 
Cameroon and Nigeria in an effort to resolve their dispute. We 
hope that our efforts there will succeed in defusing tensions 
and finding an acceptable solution. Both sides have exhibited a 
desire to reach an understanding and begin a dialogue. 
  Brothers and sisters, solidarity among African and Arab 
nations both inside and outside Africa has been instrumental in 
many great achievements concerning African liberation, the 
liquidation of imperialism, and the achievement of 
self-determination. 
  The firm backing by African nations of just Arab causes in 
various international forums has been remarkable. African 
support of the Palestinian issue and the rights of the 
Palestinian people has always been courageous and impressive. 
  Brothers and sisters, I am pleased to tell you that, 
following daunting negotiations, our efforts have been crowned 
with great success in the signing of the self-rule agreement in 
Gaza and Jericho. Israel and the Palestinians signed the 
agreement on 4 May 1994. The self-rule agreement is merely a 
first step toward fulfilling the rights and aspirations of the 
Palestinian people for self-determination. We hope that it will 
be followed by similar steps on other tracks of the Arab-Israeli 
peace talks and that a just and comprehensive peace will be 
achieved by all the nations of the Middle East. 
  Brothers and sisters, seen from a political and strategic 
overview, African and Middle East security are linked. This is 
why we made an initiative, which we are trying to promote in 
various forums. This initiative calls for turning the Middle 
East and Africa into zones that are free from nuclear weapons 
and weapons of mass destruction. 
  Today, Africa and the Middle East face new horizons as the 
21st century approaches. Our nations need to preserve their 
resources and potentials, elevate their standards of living, and 
achieve development and prosperity. The only way to attain 
these noble objectives is by maintaining security and stability 
throughout Africa and the Middle East. The threat of mass 
destruction should disappear from Africa, the birthplace of the 
oldest civilizations, and the Middle East, the birthplace of 
major religions and the ancient cultures of the East. Our 
nations look with hope and confidence to reaping together the 
fruits of the great seeds sown by our founding fathers 30 years 
ago in the black African soil. 
  Brothers and sisters, during the past year you gave me the 
honor of being OAU chairman for the second time in five years. 
You laid on me the responsibility of representing it and 
speaking with the leaders of the outside world on your behalf. 
I hope that my efforts in this connection were adequate to the 
task. 
  On this occasion, I feel it is necessary for me to offer my 
thanks to all the brother presidents for the sincere fraternal 
cooperation they have shown me. This helped me to accomplish 
the chairman's tasks. Throughout my period of responsibility I 
did not feel I was alone but was always surrounded by your 
sincere support. None of you hesitated to carry out what I asked 
them to do for the good of our mutual interests and united 
destiny. This gave me additional pride in your comradeship and 
fraternity and in belonging with you to the greater African 
entity and its splendid civilization. Furthermore, your 
objective attitude, frankness, truthfulness to yourselves, and 
putting the general interest above other considerations have 
given me fresh confidence in this young continent's future and 
the ability of its future generations to confront new problems 
and challenges with total fortitude. In this task they will 
rely on their unshakeable faith in the principles of African 
unity and their firm commitment to strengthening solidarity and 
cooperation among the continent's nations until their noble 
objectives are attained. 
  Brothers and sisters, I must not forget to offer my thanks 
to 
OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim for his sincere 
cooperation and perseverance which decisively helped us to carry 
out the achievements of the past year. 
  Long live our African continent in security and stability. 
Long live its nations, united and strong. Long live the 
African nations' struggle for economic development and progress. 
Long live the memory of Africa's devout martyrs. 
  Let the torches of liberty burn everywhere in Africa. Let 
the light of learning and civilization spread in the corners of 
this glorious continent. 
  Long live the OAU. Long live the memory of its pioneers and 
founding leaders. May God give us all success. Peace and the 
mercy of God be with you. [applause]

<F P=106> [Address by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat at the opening </F>
session of the OAU summit conference in Tunis -- live] 
  [Excerpts] Your excellency, Brother Chairman; Your 
excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, on this occasion, the 
convening of the 30th session of the OAU summit conference on 
the green land of Tunisia, I address you from heart to heart, in 
my own name, on behalf of my brothers, the members of the PLO 
Executive Committee and the government of the Palestinian 
national authority, and on behalf of our Palestinian people. 
The warmest greetings and best wishes for success for the 
proceedings of your respected summit. [passage omitted] 
  Your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen. [passage omitted] 
We 
are facing some problems, which are slightly hampering the tasks 
of our Palestinian National Authority. This is due to the very 
slow implementation on the ground of what had been agreed upon, 
in addition to the procrastination of some of the states which 
promised funds in handing out these funds, even though they 
committed themselves to and agreed upon such amounts during 
their successive meetings to enable the government of the 
Palestinian National Authority to create its bodies and 
institutions, to embark upon the construction process of our 
national economy, and our public facilities, which are totally 
destroyed -- totally destroyed -- due to the Israeli occupation. 
Yes, totally destroyed due to the Israeli occupation. 
  We have to start our reconstruction work among the rubble 
left behind by the occupation. This situation has gone as far 
as starvation in Gaza, which is witnessing the highest 
population density in the world. [passage omitted] 
  Yes, Your excellences, heads of state; it is a destroyed 
infrastructure. This situation does not only hinder the 
National Authority Government from shouldering its 
responsibilities, it also frustrates the hopes our people pin on 
the peace process and the future of coexistence and cooperation 
in the region. It will also weaken the ongoing efforts we are 
making with all the brothers and friends aimed at achieving a 
just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. A peace, which 
safeguards and guarantees stability, security, and welfare for 
all the region's nations and states. This peace would also 
guarantee for our Palestinian people the end of the Israeli 
occupation of their land and sanctity, enabling them to restore 
and practice their firm national rights of freedom, independence 
and sovereignty, and to achieve a just and comprehensive peace 
on all fronts throughout the region. 
  Mr President, heads of states and brother participants. No 
doubt you are following the successive statements and the 
fabricated storm which some Israelis are stirring, particularly 
regarding the issue of Jerusalem and its isolation and the 
demographic and settlement changes in it, which is seen as a 
violation to what we have agreed upon: Not to make a decision 
in advance regarding the issues earmarked for the final stage of 
negotiations, at the forefront of which are the issues of 
Jerusalem, settlement, refugees and the final borders, and other 
issues. With these measures, stances and statements the Israeli 
Government, or some members of the Israeli Government, is 
working to impose a status quo situation in advance regarding an 
issue that touches the feelings not only of the Palestinian 
people -- yes, not only the Palestinian people -- but that of 
the Arabs, the Muslims, the Christians throughout the world. 
This also is seen as a blatant violation of UN resolutions, 
Geneva conventions on human rights, and Arab, African, Islamic, 
Nonalignment conferences' resolutions on this holy issue. It 
also violates the resolutions and stances of the U.S. 
Administration, the European Union, Russia, China, Japan and 
others. 
  By making these statements and taking these stances some 
Israeli quarters are weakening the steps that are aimed at 
building trust, which we are working to establish between the 
two peoples in order to make a new Middle East, which in the 
future would be based on coexistence and cooperation between 
nations. However, the continuation of such statements and 
measures will not help to advance the peace process toward 
achieving the hoped-for goals, which harbor good, and benefits 
for all nations and states in the region and the world. 
  We understand, yes, we understand the importance of the 
religious position of the holy city for all religions. We 
respect this out of a total loyalty to the spiritual and civil 
heritage of Jerusalem and Palestine; its tolerance and peaceful 
coexistence among the religions throughout the centuries. 
Therefore, we should all protect these civil, religious, 
historic and humanitarian values. We will not allow, we will 
not allow any extremist forces, either over here or over there, 
to obstruct, or sabotage the peace process, or to alter the 
character of the holy city as it is held by all these divine 
religions. 
  Mr Chairman, please allow me to use this platform, allow me, 
presidents, to use this platform and talk to Mr. Rabin to tell 
him; I would like to tell Mr. Rabin: Let us protect the peace 
of the brave; let us protect the peace of the brave and the 
achievements of this peace for our peoples, for our peoples, our 
children, for the whole region, and the for the world. 
  Your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen. Our concerns are 
the same, our development problems are the same. From this 
premise, we look at the issues of Arab-African coordination and 
cooperation as an urgent necessity in the shadow of the facts 
and developments in the new international relations. This makes 
it necessary for us all to take into account these developments 
and to consolidate our collective and bilateral relations on 
modern bases which serve the aspirations of our peoples for 
development and construction. 
  We are all called upon to develop the mechanisms of our 
action and cooperation within the Arab League, the OAU, the 
Islamic Conference Organization and the Nonaligned Movement in 
order to settle the issues and crises facing us on the security, 
social and economic levels within the framework of this new 
world order, about which the late Rajiv Ghandi said: New order, 
new order to order; [previous six words in English] and also 
settling bilateral differences and conflicts within the 
framework of understanding, dialogue, and mutual respect between 
us all, so as to prevent foreign interference, and not to allow 
the imposition of solutions which do not agree with the 
interests of our peoples and countries, and which are likely to 
make conflicts worse and put a seal of approval on them. 
[passage omitted] 
  We will preserve, God willing, after our return to our 
homeland, Palestine, our membership [as an observer] if you 
allow us, if you allow us to keep this membership, which gives 
us pleasure and pride. We will continue to give impetus to the 
cooperation between the government of the Palestinian National 
Authority and the PLO, and our African brothers in all fields. 
[passage omitted] 
  Your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen. We are entering the 
new stage of our people's struggle with self-confidence, and the 
confidence in our people's capability and will to deal with it 
with intelligence, wisdom and far-sightedness, knowing the 
volume of current and future difficulties and challenges. Out 
of the depth of the ties of brotherhood and common destiny 
linking our peoples, and our joint aspiration for the future, we 
expect your warm and fraternal backing and your support for our 
efforts and those of our people in completing the construction 
of their national independence so they can live free and 
sovereign lives on their land, in their state, and contribute 
with their brothers in the Arab and African world and in the 
region to achieving the supreme goals for which we all work, for 
the future and aspirations of our peoples. 
  We reiterate our solidarity with the fraternal and friendly 
peoples in Rwanda, Somalia and Liberia, hoping that they will 
overcome their ordeals. We also declare our solidarity with the 
peoples of Angola and Mozambique with regard to the issue of 
democracy. We call for lifting the blockades on the fraternal 
people of Libya and Iraq, and for an end to the tragedies facing 
the fraternal people of Bosnia. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The 30th summit of the OAU enters its second day 
today in Tunis. South African President Nelson Mandela, who was 
imprisoned for 27 years and has become the first black president 
of a multiracial and democratic South Africa, was given a 
rousing welcome as he entered the conference hall. Rwanda, with 
its hundreds of thousands of deaths and refugees, became the 
main topic of discussion at the opening session during which the 
Egyptian president handed over the OAU chairmanship to Tunisian 
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. 
  General Eyadema, who is also attending the summit, saw his 
mediation efforts crowned with the reconciliation between 
Nigerian and Cameroonian heads of state, who were at loggerheads 
over the Bakassi Peninsula. Kojovi Gbadayi reports from Tunis: 
  [Begin recording] [Gbadayi] There were 42 African heads of 
state and monarchs present at the opening session of the 30th 
summit of the pan-African organization. Among these heads of 
state was President Gnassingbe Eyadema, who went to Tunis to 
make Togo's voice heard. The various speakers -- from President 
Ben Ali of Tunisia to President Mubarak of Egypt, passing 
through President Konan Bedie of Cote d'Ivoire and Nelson 
Mandela of South Africa, as well as UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali -- in turn called for the redress of Africa, the 
strengthening of mutual understanding, and inter-African 
cooperation. 
  The main event of the day, however, was the meeting in the 
afternoon between Presidents Paul Biya of Cameroon and Sani 
Abacha of Nigeria. This is the first time that two heads of 
state, at loggerheads over their common border, are meeting at 
the initiative of President Eyadema. For several months now, 
the Togolese head of state has been devoting his efforts to 
reconciling the views of the Nigerian and Cameroonian leaders in 
order to arrive at the peaceful settlement of the conflict over 
Bakassi Island. The Abacha-Biya meeting was sanctioned by a 
joint communique, the French version of which was read by 
Cameroonian Foreign Minister Ferdinand Oyono: 
  [Oyono] At the initiative of General Gnassingbe Eyadema, 
president of the Republic of Togo, President Paul Biya, 
president of the Republic of Cameroon and General Sani Abacha, 
president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria met in Tunis. The 
two heads of state examined the situation created by the 
territorial conflict between their two states. They agreed to 
set up a joint commission, under the auspices of the Togolese 
President in order to seek ways and means of finding a just and 
peaceful solution to the conflict, without resorting to the 
International Court of Justice. To this end, a meeting, to be 
preceded by a foreign ministers' conference, will take place 
within the next few weeks in Lome. 
  [Gbadayi] The Nigerian and Cameroonian heads of state 
embraced each other before leaving their host, Gen. Eyadema. 
President Eyadema had earlier in the morning received Rene 
Delaire, the French president's adviser on African affairs. [end

  [Text] Things get no better in the Liberian movement, ULIMO 
[United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia], split 
between Alhaji Koromah's Mandingo forces and the Krahn wing of 
Roosevelt Johnson. 
  In spite of Alhaji Koromah's protestations, it seems very 
few 
of his men are left in his old headquarters at Tubmanburg 
following Roosevelt Johnson's recent assault on the town, and 
the peacekeeping force, ECOMOG [Economic Community of West 
African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] has been accused of 
siding with Johnson. Well, yesterday, Roosevelt Johnson called 
us to say that Alhaji Koromah has now been finally and 
irreversibly ousted as ULIMO leader. Today, Alhaji Koromah 
called us from Conakry to repeat allegations against ECOMOG. 
Robin White asked him what he had to say: 
  [Begin recording] [Koromah] We are asking the field 
commander of ECOMOG to immediately withdraw his forces -- 
Nigerian forces that are in ULIMO territory -- because they have 
contravened the Cotonou accord by engaging in active combat 
against us, along with the dissidents. 
  [White] What exactly are you accusing the ECOMOG troops of 
doing? 
  [Koromah] In fact, I got word from my commander by radio 
communication that the iman of Tubmanburg, Imam Mohamed Sheriff, 
who sought refuge at the ECOMOG base in Tubmanburg, has been 
found dead. Secondly, another commander of ULIMO, Brother Allen, 
was taken by the Nigerian ECOMOG, tortured -- his bodyguards 
killed -- and asked as to where we were getting our arms and 
ammunition from. 
  [White] Have you now fled to Guinea? 
  [Koromah] You have interviewed me many times from Conakry. 
I have fled to nowhere. We control six counties within 
Liberia, so, this is no fleeing. In fact, from here I will be 
touring a couple of other countries that contributed to ECOMOG. 
  [White] But you couldn't get to Tubmanburg today. 
  [Koromah] Today, no; it is not on may schedule. 
  [White] But you wouldn't be able to go there at all. 
  [Koromah] Well, it's the insecurity in times of fighting. 
Obviously it will not be prudent to go and sit in the middle of 
the fighting and be a target just to prove that you are in 
control or you are brave. That will be stupid. 
  [White] How many men do you still have with you? 
  [Koromah] I have the entire ULIMO, beside the dissidents. 
You should be asking those who are fighting how many couple of 
hundred men we have! We have more than nine, 10, 11 thousand 
ULIMO soldiers, and you ought to know that Lofa alone has six to 
seven thousand ULIMO soldiers! 
  [White] Mr. Koromah, if they only have a couple of hundred 
men, why have they managed to drive you out of Tubmanburg? 
  [Koromah] Well, if you were listening to me, you wouldn't 
ask that question. I just told you that these people are 
fighting along with active combat Nigerians, and they're using 
heavy artillery and other things, and they never drove us out of 
Tubmanburg! 
  [White] They say that they've sacked you as ULIMO leader. 
  [Koromah] Well, I mean they want to kill me, so we shouldn't 
be surprised to hear them say they sacked me. Somebody wants 
your head, he's talking about sacking. They don't have 
legitimacy, territorially, militarily, and otherwise to sack 
anybody anywhere. So, they cannot be recognized by any 
international organization. These are dissident groups that are 
fighting. My only concern here is that we do not want the 
peacekeepers to continue to get involved with it. [end recording]

  [Text] The decision to withdraw from Liberia by the 
Ghanaians and the Nigerians will now see Nigeria and Ghana 
following the example of Senegal, which withdrew from Liberia in 
the heat of the Liberian crisis, after Senegal violated the 
Standing Operation Procedure, the SOP, in the peacekeeping 
operation in Liberia. 
  There has been a whole month of international condemnation 
of 
the Nigerian atrocities and lack of neutrality in the Liberian 
crisis coming from the human rights group Africa Watch in U.S. 
State Department. The leadership of the NPFL [National 
Patriotic Front of Liberia] has repeated that it is prepared to 
resume the disarmament process unimpeded, provided the Cotonou 
Accord, dealing with the aspect of government and that of the 
status of the Nigerian ECOMOG [Economic Community of West 
African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] force, are fully 
addressed.

  [Text] In Liberia, the peace process appears to be almost 
at a complete standstill. Disarmament of the warring factions 
has come to a halt and the clashes have continued. 
  All this makes the elections planned for September look very 
doubtful, and there is great dissatisfaction about the slow 
progress among the international groups involved in the country. 
In fact, the United States is threatening to stop all aid and 
assistance to the country by the end of the month unless there 
is a major step forward in disarmament. The ultimatum was 
delivered to the Liberian National Transitional Government, the 
LNTG. In Monrovia, Charley Brooks spoke to the speaker of the 
LNTG, Morris Dukuly, and asked him for his reaction to the U.S. 
threat: 
  [Begin recording] [Dukuly] One has to realize that 
frustration has been seen in many quarters. I personally am not 
surprised at the United States, or the United Nations, or ECOWAS 
[Economic Community of West African States] and ECOMOG [ECOWAS 
Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] who express frustration. Even 
those of us who are involved in the process cannot help but be 
frustrated. 
  [Brooks] What people are looking for now is that what is the 
LNTG doing, I mean, really to speed up the process? 
  [Dukuly] You know, it is unfair for anyone to blame the 
LNTG. 
The LNTG is the picture of the parties to Cotonou. LNTG was 
expected to succeed where IGNU [Interim Government of National 
Unity] failed because LNTG was seen as a government of 
inclusion, the reunified government, with all of the parties 
represented and, therefore, cooperating. Are the parties 
cooperating? I would plainly say not to the degree that we 
would like to see them cooperate. What can the LNTG do about 
that? I would say not very much. The LNTG does not have the 
military force to whip a party into line if a party refuses to 
cooperate. 
  [Brooks] Mr. Speaker, do you think with the slow pace of the 
peace process, do you think the holding of the elections is 
possible in September? 
  [Dukuly] You report for BBC Network; you see the realities. 
Do the realities here point to the possibility of elections in 
September? You need to create a secure, arms-free environment 
in order to resettle displaced people before you even talk of 
elections but I don't think that the realities on the ground 
point to that. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Lagos, 13 Jun (AFP) -- Nigeria's pro-democracy 
movement failed Monday [13 June] to spark a civil disobedience 
campaign here as police stepped up a manhunt for the businessman 
who has declared himself the country's elected president. 
Business was as usual in the economic capital Lagos, where the 
National Democratic Campaign (NADECO) backing millionaire tycoon 
Moshood Abiola against the military junta had called for a week 
of peaceful protest from Monday. [passage omitted] 
  Short demonstrations took place in the northern Palmgrove 
and 
Iyana Ipaja suburbs of Lagos, a city of some six million 
inhabitants, an AFP correspondent reported. Riot police rapidly 
intervened against tyre-burning protestors in one of the 
incidents. 
  Abiola planned Monday to hold a "series of meeting with 
friends and political associates," one source close to the 
self-proclaimed president said. The source did disclose where 
the talks would be held and who would attend. If caught, Abiola 
faces treason charges. [passage omitted] 
  A score of armed police and an armoured vehicle on Monday 
stood guard at one end of the Ibrahim Babangida bridge, linking 
parts of Lagos built on islands in the lagoon with the mainland. 
  Reporting Abiola's formation of a parallel government more 
than 24 hours after the event, the daily THE NEWS in a special 
edition on Monday devoted its whole front page to a picture of 
the businessman brandishing his fist in triumph, with the title 
"President Abiola". Other newspapers, warned by the closure by 
police Saturday of Abiola's Concord group of publications, used 
foreign news agency dispatches reporting the event. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The die appears to have been cast between the 
Nigerian military government and Chief M.K.O. Abiola. On 
Saturday [11 June], the anniversary of last year's abortive 
presidential election, the chief's aides announced that he had 
declared himself president and been sworn in before a crowd of 
thousands of supporters and that he had escaped from house 
arrest and was now in hiding. The Nigerian police say he is a 
wanted man and are offering a reward for his arrest. But now, 
the police are expressing doubts about whether the chief really 
did appear in public on Saturday. Nigerian journalist Eddy Iro 
has just flown in from Lagos. Robin White asked him if he 
shared those doubts: 
  [Begin recording] [Iro] I think the swearing in never 
happened. I have met nobody, spoken to nobody who witnessed the 
swearing in. No newspaper in Nigeria carried it and Nigerian 
papers are very independent. Nobody could have stopped them 
from carrying a report of that swearing in if it took place. 
Even Abiola's own newspaper, the SUNDAY CONCORD -- a copy of 
which I had -- didn't carry the story. 
  [White] So, did anything happen at all, do you think? 
  [Iro] I have had reports that a recorded message was sent 
out 
from Chief Abiola, from wherever, I don't know. But I believe 
that this whole thing was targeted not at the Nigerian public, 
but at Western public opinion and Western media fell for it. 
  [White] What would be the point of lying about something 
like 
this? 
  [Iro] Well, this has been at this stage now more a 
propaganda 
war. He wrote to Vice President Al Gore to help him persuade 
the Nigerian military government to assume power and the 
question would be why would he be talking to Vice President Al 
Gore? 
  [White] Do you have any idea where Abiola is? 
  [Iro] I have absolutely no idea. The police have declared 
him wanted. He is presumably...[pauses] he is within Nigeria. 
I have also learned reliably that there has been a ban on 
private air flights because the last time he left Nigeria, he 
left in his private jet and I gather than the military 
government has banned all private flights within and outside 
Nigeria. 
  [White] There has been a rumor, I think, that he might be in 
the American Embassy. Do you think that might be true? 
  [Iro] It could be true because there was a statement issued 
by the police which covertly warned about foreign embassy 
involvement, foreign countries' involvement in this matter. 
There has been that suggestion that he might be in the American 
Embassy. But if he is declared wanted, one would expect the 
American Embassy officials to own up to his presence on their 
premises. At the time I left Lagos, they had not responded to 
any indication that he might be within their custody. 
  [White] Do you think Abiola has won a trick or lost a trick 
over this weekend? 
  [Iro] I think he has reduced his quest to something of a 
farce. If this was his idea of a swearing in, of assuming the 
presidency, I do not consider it a serious political challenge 
to the military government. I am by no means a supporter of 
this or any military government, I want to make that very clear, 
but I believe that the process of this entangling the military 
should continue through the National Constitutional Conference, 
the elections of which have been held and which should be 
getting to motion within the next week or two. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Sola Odunfa has been talking to 
one of Abiola's leading supporters, the radical lawyer Chief 
Gani Fewehinmi, and he put it to him that this was the beginning 
of the end for Chief Abiola: 
  [Begin recording] [Fawehinmi] Well, I don't think, I don't 
think so. I don't think the end of Abiola has come. I think a 
new chapter has been opened by his declaration that he is the 
president of the country. Now the situation in the country is 
so politically confused that the government itself is jittery, 
is in panic. The government cannot see the surf for the woods. 
The government is in quandary and you can see clearly the way 
the president spoke, I mean the head of state spoke on the 
television yesterday. He looked a shell of himself. He was 
dumb. He was drab. He was inconsistent. He wasn't looking 
very happy and that means, really, that since they could not 
even identify the place where Abiola had declared himself, I 
mean they were surprised that he beat the entire security 
network of this country. He declared himself before a crowd of 
more than 3,000 people and he was not caught by the security 
forces. Up till today, they couldn't find him and they made a 
laughingstock of themselves by saying that there was a price of 
50,000 on the head of a man like that, and that means in 
ordinary times they converted it and it is $950. And that is a 
ridiculous thing. Really, it shows clearly that the government 
is in panic. It is not in control, and I think this is a 
government that is tottering. 
  [Odunfa] Where is Chief Abiola now? 
  [Fawehinmi] Honestly, I don't know. I only know that he has 
declared himself president and many Nigerians are happy that 
that has been done, at least to confront a government that has 
no legitimacy. 
  [Odunfa] Why should he go into hiding? 
  [Fawehinmi] I don't know. Really, I cannot proffer an answer 
to that. All I know is that Nigerians are relieved that somehow 
he has shown courage. For the first time, he has shown a lot of 
courage and he has redeemed his image and he has put this 
government on the run. The government now is in quandary. The 
government is in chaos. 
  [Odunfa] What will happen now? 
  [Fawehinmi] Anything can happen in Nigeria now. Just 
anything can happen because there is no stability. [end 
recording] 
  Now, today was supposed to mark the start of protests by the 
prodemocracy groups in Nigeria, who are calling for the military 
government to step down. On the line to Lagos, Robin White 
asked Sola Odunfa what sort of response there had been to the 
call for a stay away: 
  [Begin recording] [Odunfa] There wasn't much response on the 
island. Most people went to work. All government offices were 
conducting normal business. All business houses on Lagos Island 
operated normally. The only problem was on the mainland where 
many markets and several shops did not open. All along Agege 
motor road which is a very long stretch of road, about 5 km, not 
a single shop opened when I went there at about 2 P.M. this 
afternoon. 
  [White] What about elsewhere in the country? 
  [Odunfa] The reports I have got so far are that in the north 
everybody went to work normally; the same thing in the east. In 
the west, there was some demonstration, people staying away from 
work, especially in Ogun State, the home state of Chief Abiola. 
But on the whole, it has not been a successful thing as was 
done last year. 
  [White] So it has been a bit of a damp squib, everything? 
  [Odunfa] It looks like that so far. 
  [White] And what about Abiola declaring himself as 
president? 
Has that been a damp squib too? 
  [Odunfa] No, it was definitely not! Although people went to 
work, you find that at least in Lagos about 90 percent of the 
residents still support Abiola. 
  [White] There have been suggestions, I think coming from the 
police force, that there was no swearing-in ceremony at all; 
that it was all a makeup by his supporters. 
  [Odunfa] I read the statement by the deputy inspector 
general 
of police in charge of operations. The statement would be 
correct insofar as he said that there was no swearing in. There 
was, in fact, no swearing in. What took place was that Abiola 
addressed the people and proclaimed himself president of the 
Federal Republic of Nigeria. And it took place, the event took 
place about 100 meters behind my office here. I can still see 
the sports hall which was used. It is a modern sports center 
owned by the Lagos Island local government and Abiola came there 
at about half past seven in the evening, went into the club 
house on the premises, and by eight his supporters had informed 
people around that Abiola was around and that they should come 
and see him. And it was a huge crowd here. The entire street 
was blocked by people. 
  [White] [words indistinct] absolutely clear, you have spoken 
to a lot of people who saw him declare himself. 
  [Odunfa] Yes, everybody, in fact people in my building here 
and people on the street, everybody was there. [end recording]

  [Text] The police say that they are continuing their effort 
to locate Chief M.K.O. Abiola's whereabouts. In a statement in 
Lagos yesterday, the police said that security arrangements in 
Chief Abiola's house were intact. According to the statement, 
there was no evidence that the Saturday [11 June] self 
declaration purported to have been made by Chief Abiola (?was 
made) in Lagos. The police also said that since the release and 
court bail of Chief Segun Osoba, they have not seen him despite 
repeated visits to his known address.

<F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] After the extraordinary events of the weekend in 
Nigeria with Chief Abiola, the man widely believed to have won 
last year's elections first proclaiming himself president then 
slipping into hiding, it is too far from clear what the 
implications of his move will be. Reports from Nigeria suggest 
that his calls for mass protests have not been heeded and he is 
still being hunted by the authorities. On the line to Nigeria, 
David Sted asked the chief of the Nigerian police, (Suleman 
Lao), how the search was going. 
  [Begin recording] [(Lao)] The search for Chief Abiola is 
still progressing well. We have asked all people or everyone 
who knows his whereabouts to report it to the police immediately. 
  [Sted] Do you think that he is still Lagos? 
  [(Lao)] That we cannot say, but we have every reason to 
believe that he is still here in Lagos. I may also ask whether 
you know where he is now? Can I ask that question? 
  [Sted] You can, but I shan't be able to help unfortunately 
because I don't know either. 
  [(Lao)] Thank you. 
  [Sted] There is some suspicion that he might be in the U.S. 
Embassy in Lagos. Have you heard that at all? 
  [(Lao)] I have heard that rumor but I don't think the United 
States of America would do that type of thing. 
  [Sted] Have you checked the embassy? 
  [(Lao)] We have not yet checked the embassy because we don't 
believe that. We have excellent relationship with the American 
Embassy. 
  [Sted] Chief Abiola had been placed on house arrest before 
the weekend. How was it that he was able to slip past your 
officers? 
  [(Lao)] That is what we don't know. That happens everywhere. 
You try to put people in the most safest area that you believe 
it to be as such and they do escape. It is not only here in 
Nigeria, you see. 
  [Sted] There is still some debate over whether or not Chief 
Abiola did in fact attend a meeting to announce that he was 
going to be the president. Is there any evidence that such a 
meeting actually took place? 
  [(Lao)] We have not had any evidence that a meeting did 
actually take place. I don't know quite honestly. 
  [Sted] If and when you find Chief Abiola, what will you do 
with him? 
  [(Lao)] Well until we have found him, we cannot predict what 
we will do with him yet. 
  [Sted] But will he be charged with some offense? 
  [(Lao)] We are still looking for him and we will....[pauses] 
You see, Nigeria has a very good legal system. We don't charge 
people like that until we ask them questions, until they say 
yes, this and this. So we have one of the excellent legal 
procedures here in this country. Abiola is declared a wanted 
person to answer some questions. 
  [Sted] Could I just ask you what he is wanted for? 
  [(Lao)] Yes. He is wanted for some alleged statements that 
he has made. As I said, we haven't yet established that until 
we have found that from him, whether he did in fact make those 
statements. [end recording]

  [Text] Nigerians residing in border areas of the country 
have again been assured of their safety. The director of 
defense information, Brigadier General Fred Chijuka, gave the 
assurance today in an interview with a Radio Nigeria 
correspondent. On alleged invasion of parts of Borno State by 
the Chadian Army, the director said that the report was not 
true. He explained that what happened was that Chadian forces 
clashed with Chadian rebels near the border with Nigeria. 
Brig.-Gen. Chijuka asked people living in the border areas not 
to panic, as the government would ensure adequate protection for 
them at all times.

  [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] continues with its warmongering pretensions all 
over Angola. This morning it once more tried to storm and take 
over the city of Malanje, but was promptly repelled by 
government troops. Our correspondent Francisco Curingana reports 
from the area: 
  At dawn today, at 0200, a group of UNITA armed bandits who 
tried to murder civilians and loot their property fled in 
disarray when the civilians and the civilian defense members 
responded to the attack. In its flight the enemy left explosive 
devices, destroying three abandoned houses. This kind of action 
has been occurring frequently, shows the desperation of the 
enemy, since they are failing to justify to their commanders the 
failure in the operations against Malanje. Thirteen UNITA 
rebels were put out of action on 11 June in Lombe, west of 
Malanje, and the government forces recovered eight AKM weapons, 
two RPK machine guns, 1,368 rounds of ammunition, and three 
South African made antitank mines. The government forces regret 
the death of two of its valorous combatants. 
  In the south in Quitapa, 18 km from the city of Malanje, the 
situation is calm and under the control of the government forces 
and life in the city is going on normally. All institutions are 
running smoothly, despite shortages of commodities in local 
markets and soaring prices.

  [Text] In the city of Kuito, in Bie Province, the military 
situation has worsened over the past 24 hours, with hand to hand 
clashes throughout the city. Troops from the National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] have so far fired about 
10,000 shells over Kuito. Our correspondent Abel Abraao reports. 
  [Begin Abraao recording] Since 2000 yesterday fierce clashes 
have been taking place between government troops and UNITA rebel 
forces. The hand to hand clashes which began last evening, are 
still continuing, at an intensity never seen before, in the 
southern part of the city, where government forces are 
inflicting heavy defeats on Jonas Savimbi's men. The situation 
is very tense here in Kuito, following the resumption of 
shellings, after the apparent calm registered yesterday morning 
and early afternoon. 
  The Black Cockerel's men have been firing shells of various 
of calibers, including 120-mm, 106-mm, and [words indistinct], 
on Kuito. It is thought that more than 10,000 shells have been 
fired on the city since 2000 yesterday, the time when UNITA 
intensified its attacks and shellings. 
  What is more, the mortality rate continues to increase 
because of the shortage of food and medicine [words indistinct] 
provisional hospital to assist the wounded. [end recording] 
  There is also tension in Malanje Province. UNITA rebels 
continue to carry out actions against civilians and military 
targets. Government forces have not been folding their arms and 
in the past days, many rebels were put out of action. Our 
correspondent Francisco Kuringana reports from Malanje. 
  [Begin Kuringana recording] UNITA rebels in the service of 
Jonas Savimbi continue to carry out actions against civilians 
and positions defended by the government forces defending the 
city of Malanje. For example, Jonas Savimbi's men tried to 
infilitrate into Canambua Ward at 0800 yesterday but the [words 
indistinct] thwarted the action, resulting in the death of three 
rebels and the wounding of several others, as well as the 
capture of a quantity of war material. At this moment, clashes 
continue in different corners of the city of Malanje. The 
government forces' intend to expand the city's defensive cordon 
in order to reestablish tranquility and happiness of the these 
people affected by war. Meanwhile, the situation continues 
under the control of government forces. Institutions and [words 
indistinct] despite present difficulties. [end recording]

Council members to whom I briefed on the peace process. After 
what happened in Angola, Somalia and Rwanda, the international 
community, Europeans, and Americans are not interested in 
investing in countries where [words indistinct] so it was 
necessary for me to guarantee that war will not be resumed in 
Mozambique. So, I am happy because I achieved my aims in both 
New York and Washington. 
  Moreover, the people there were not well versed on the 
situation in Mozambique. They were misinformed. Renamo is a 
movement that fought for democracy and freedom, and due to this 
struggle, the Mozambican people will for the first time have a 
democratically elected president. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Did you happen to meet high 
level U.S. officials? 
  [Dhlakama] Yes, I was received by U.S. Assistant Secretary 
for African Affairs George Moose and the [word indistinct], so I 
was well received [words indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] Is there a possibility that Renamo will 
receive financial assistance from the United States? 
  [Dhlakama] Yes, they have pledged to assist us. [end

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama </F>
with unidentified correspondents in Maputo on 13 June; 
italicized passages recorded] 
  [Text] Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader 
Afonso Dhlakama returned to the country yesterday after a visit 
to the United States. Speaking at a news conference in Maputo 
this afternoon, Afonso Dhlakama said the Clinton administration 
supports his desire for the formation of a government of 
national unity, regardless of the results of the first 
multiparty elections in October this year. Dhlakama said that 
to guarantee national unity, the party that wins the coming 
elections should form a government where the winner and the 
losers would be represented. He said the United States promised 
him to intercede so that the president of the republic will 
accept the proposal. 
  Asked by journalists what would happen if the Mozambique 
Liberation Front [Frelimo] won the elections and refused to form 
the so-called government of national unity, which he advocates, 
Afonso Dhlakama said: 
  [Dhlakama] There will be no problem. There will be no 
problem. If Frelimo wins the elections and it does not accept a 
government of national unity, there will be no problem. You 
should realize that when Renamo advocates a government of 
national unity, it is not doing it from a position of weakness. 
On the contrary, our position is good compared to any other 
party, including Frelimo. However, we think that as these are 
the first elections after the war, there is a need for the 
winner and the losers to come together. This is very important. 
It is very important, particularly considering that these are 
the first elections and they are being held after the war. 
There is a need to know the future of the winner and losers. 
There is a need to know how the winner will treat the loser. 
  We are not insisting on a government of national unity 
because we are worried that we are going to lose the elections, 
and we want to rule. Americans told me that it was a good idea. 
Thus, I requested them to assist Mozambicans to work in this 
direction because this is part of the spirit of national 
reconciliation, to calm down other political forces, and to 
jointly study our country's future and development. They told 
me that they would convey the message to President Chissano. 
  The Renamo leader said at the news conference this afternoon 
that the voter registration process preparing to hold the first 
multiparty elections is facing many problems caused by what he 
described as cadres of the ruling Frelimo Party. 
  [Dhlakama] This has already taken place in Gaza, 
Manica. Even today I received information that two Tanzanians 
who registered as voters were detected in Cabo Delgado Province. 
The two are already under police detention. There are many 
Tanzanians who are registering as voters in northern provinces. 
All this is a violation of the electoral law. We shall discuss 
the issue with our brothers. I do not know why the government 
is doing this. 
  Asked why he is always affable shortly after his regular 
meetings with the president of the republic, Dhlakama said: 
  [Dhlakama] I have always been a good person. My 
brother, I am a good person. There are times when even God 
becomes angry. There is time for jokes and time for 
seriousness. What I am saying here should be taken seriously. 
If there is another war you, as a Mozambican, will be the first 
to suffer. This is what I am saying. I have experience of war. 
I was in the bush for 16 years. I volunteered. If we are able 
to speak here today in freedom -- you call this freedom of the 
press -- it is because of the struggle led by Dhlakama. I am 
not an aggressive man. I am very calm, but when Frelimo plays 
around, I must show that I cannot accept jokes. 
  The Renamo leader said that his visit to the United States 
was a success and that he was able to convey a different image 
of his movement in that country. As a result of the visit, 
Americans changed their attitude toward Renamo, he said. He 
also said that beginning tomorrow, he will hold meetings in 
Inhambane and Xai-Xai to discuss with his cadres the civic 
education of the electorate. On 20 June, the Renamo leader will 
carry out a working visit to the provinces of Sofala, Manica, 
and Tete.

  [Text] The insecure situation in rural Bujumbura has caused 
a sizable movement of the population toward the town of 
Bujumbura. First, the refugees went to Kamenge zone. Others 
went toward the Saint Michel church, the unity monument, and the 
residence of the papal representative. According to the [words 
indistinct] contacted by telephone, the residence of the papal 
representative alone has been housing around 700 displaced 
people for the last two days -- around two-thirds are children. 
The residence is not prepared for this amount of people and was 
obliged to call for help from UNICEF, which has just finished 
distributing protein biscuits.

  [Text] Bujumbura, 13 Jun (PANA) -- Eight Burundian 
opposition parties have threatened to name their own president 
and form a parallel government if the ruling Front for Democracy 
in Burundi (Frodebu) appoints a president in July. 
  "If Frodebu (which is mainly Hutu) names a head of state on 
1 
July as has recently been announced by Jean-Marie Ngendahayo, 
Burundian foreign affairs minister, without the approval of all 
political forces in the country, the coalition of opposition 
parties will not hesitate to do likewise. If they form a 
government, we will form ours," the opposition parties said 
Sunday [12 June]. 
  The announcement was made on Sunday in Bujumbura at the end 
of a big rally originally called to raise funds for the 
displaced persons in the war, by a member of parliament, 
Francois Ngeze (Hutu) of the Union for National Progress 
(Uprona) whose membership is mainly Tutsi. [Words indistinct] 
Ngeze headed a self-proclaimed council of public salvation after 
the killing of President Melchior Ndadaye last October. 
  Ngeze said that the naming of a new president has to be done 
after 12 prerequisites have been met. These included the 
drawing of a timetable for the disarmament of civilians. He 
also called for the suspension of territorial and local 
administration officials involved in the October 1993 genocide 
and the distribution of weapons to the population, the recalling 
of ambassadors "who behave like spokespersons for Frodebu and 
not for the Burundian nation". 
  The opposition is also calling for the dismantling of the 
Presidential Guard, which has been created along the Rwandan 
model and an end to the forceful return of displaced persons to 
their homes before the minimum security and housing conditions 
were met. 
  Responding to the opposition pre-conditions, the Frodebu 
government has insisted that a president nominated from the 
majority party has to be installed first before anything else is 
considered.

<F P=106> [Report by Nina Verhaeghe in Bujumbura] </F>
  [Text] Bujumbura--Tension remains high in the Burundian 
capital due to the political impasse round the appointment of a 
new president. A text circulated political circles this week, 
said to come from the intelligence service. It spoke of the 
preparation of a coup d'etat. 
  The text gave the names of some 25 people who attended a 
clandestine meeting presided by the former president, Colonel 
Bagaza. In addition to seven members of the military, the 
meeting included representatives from the Uprona [Unity and 
National Progress], Raddes, Abasa, and Annade [expansions 
unknown] opposition parties. The text said there was a list of 
300 people who were to be eliminated, mainly from the top layers 
of Frodebu [Burundi Democratic Front]. The first attempt to 
eliminate them was normally to have started on Wednesday (8 
June). But the leaking of the information is reported to have 
prevented the attempt. It has been confirmed that there was 
panic on Wednesday among Frodebu members. 
  The text indicated 28 June as the latest possible date for 
the coup. Given its destabilizing effect, it is unlikely that 
Frodebu would itself deliberately spread false rumors. 
  In recent months there have been various rumors doing the 
rounds in Bujumbura about an imminent coup and above all about 
secret opposition meetings. They are taking place in a general 
atmosphere of considerable political insecurity. This week some 
people died in shooting incidents between armed civilians and 
soldiers, just to the north of the city.

<F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>
  [Excerpts] Kigali, June 13 (AFP)--Rwandan rebel leader Paul 
Kagame said Monday [13 June] that his fighters had seized 
control of the town of Gitarama, where the self-proclaimed 
interim government fled and set up its base in April. 
  The fall of Gitarama, 50 kilometres (30 miles) southwest of 
the embattled capital Kigali, could not be confirmed by UN 
officials in Kigali or government forces. 
  The rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) had been battling the 
army for two weeks for control of Gitarama. "We control 90 
percent of the town, including the centre, and the situation 
will be completely clear this afternoon," Kagame told reporters 
at Kanombe military camp near Kigali airport. "There was a big 
fight yesterday and last night it was taken by our forces," 
Kagame said, adding that the entire town was in rebel hands 
except for "one or two hills" where beleaguered government 
forces were still holding out. 
  "We are following government forces as they are moving 
towards Ruhengeri (a town north-west of Kigali)," Kagame added. 
  Some members of the interim government proclaimed after the 
April 6 death of president Juvenal Habyarimana fled Gitarama 
several days ago, UN spokesman Jean-Guy Plante said. 
  UN officials were unaware of the whereabouts of Prime 
Minister Jean Kambanda. 
  Fierce artillery and small arms battles meanwhile raged in 
Kigali. According to Kagame, the rebels gained ground. 
  Philippe Gaillard, head of the International Red Cross in 
Kigali, said two shells presumably fired by the rebels had 
slammed into the Red Cross hospital compound in a 
government-held area of Kigali on Sunday. Four or five others 
landed just outside. Nobody was hurt, and Gaillard said he had 
lodged protests with both sides. 
  Rebel and army commanders meanwhile resumed UN-brokered 
truce 
talks Monday at UN headquarters in Kigali's Amahoro hotel. 
  Brigadier-General Marcel Gatsinzi, representing the army, 
told reporters he had no information about Gitarama. 
  The rebels control a large section of the road south from 
Gitarama to the town of Butare and the Burundi border. [passage 
omitted] 
  UN soldiers meanwhile resumed the evacuation of civilians 
trapped behind hostile lines in Kigali, but some refused to 
leave rebel-held areas for places they considered less safe. 
  The UN has moved about 2,000 people from rebel-controlled 
areas to government-held sectors and vice-versa. But 
evacuations were suspended last week after a convoy came under 
fire. 
  The UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) decided to 
continue evacuations Monday after both sides agreed to a 
four-hour truce to allow the convoys to get through. 
  A convoy of empty trucks set out Monday morning for the 
Sainte- Famille church, where about 8,000 people are sheltering 
behind government lines. Another convoy went to the rebel-held 
Amahoro stadium. Each was to ferry about 150 people to areas 
the UN considers safer. But none of the 5,000 civilians 
encamped in squalor at the stadium would go. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] After recent fierce fighting, the town of 
Gitarama is entirely in the hands of the Rwandan Patriotic Front 
[RPF]. Our colleague, Jean-Paul Habineza, reports. 
  [Begin Habineza recording] Gitarama is entirely in the hands 
of the RPF. Fighting had been fierce of late in Gitarama. 
After realizing that the RPF had captured Kabgayi, 2 to 3 km 
from the town, government forces reinforced their positions with 
additional troops mostly from Ruhengeri. They even lightly 
pushed back the RPF. The RPF soldiers then surrounded Gitarama 
town and closed all entry roads. The fighting increased. Some 
government soldiers lost their lives while others fled. 
  The chief commander of the Rwandan Patriotic Army, Major 
General Paul Kagame, said it was this morning that the RPF 
clearly captured Gitarama town. Our friend Louise Kayibanda, 
who sent us the news, informed us that she visited Murambi the 
headquarters of the so-called government and said that the area 
looked like a farm, so it is clear that the so-called government 
left the place long ago. On the significance of capturing 
Gitarama, Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame said the meaning was both 
political and military. Politically, it is clear that the 
government, which is continuously on the run, is useless. 
Militarily, Paul Kagame said, this victory, along with others 
shows that the RPF troops are doing well at the front. Paul 
Kagame said the continuing fighting was aimed at stopping the 
killings. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Excerpts] According to news sent to us by our colleague 
Louise Kayibanda in Gitarama the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] 
troops found an enormous hole where many people had been buried. 
Louise Kayibanda says that along the Gitarama-Nyanza road, 
there are many refugees who escaped the killings and other 
refugees who had come from Gisenyi. These had earlier fled the 
fighting and went to Gisenyi, but they were sent back because 
they were Banyenduga. They returned to the RPF area. [passage 
omitted] 
  Government forces are in a critical situation on all fronts; 
those on Kigali hill are counting their days. Those on Jari 
hill may even have fled by now. For the government forces, it 
is as bad to hear about the fall of Gitarama as the fall of 
Kanombe airport area. Gitarama was the second headquarters of 
the so-called government. Shortly, the government will be on 
the run forever. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The first reaction to the Rwandan Patriotic Front 
announcement of the capture of Gitarama was that of the interim 
president, Theodore Sindikubwabo, who is in Tunis. He was 
speaking to Assane Diop: 
  [Begin Sindikubwabo recording] If Gitarama has fallen, there 
are still 10 prefectures, quite a few of them still controlled 
by our armed forces, and we have the choice of working where we 
want. Gitarama is at a crossroads leading to Butare in the 
south, to Kigali. It is also at a crossroads leading to 
Gisenyi, to Kibuye. It is an economically strategic point, it is 
a strategic place for the fighting because, militarily, if the 
government forces are split, those of the south, those of the 
north, those of [word indistinct], this would be extremely 
serious for us. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Theodore Sindikubwabo learned about the fall of 
Gitarama at the 30th OAU meeting in Tunis. A correspondent 
asked him for his reaction. Old Man Sindikubwabo, who has 
started to forget how to count, said it does not mean anything 
as the government still controls 10 prefectures. His counting 
due to advanced age is wrong as Rwanda does not have 15 
prefectures. Rwanda did not grow bigger after his two-month stay 
in power. Rwanda has 10 prefectures and the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front [RPF] controls many of them. Among these are Byumba, 
Kibungo, Kigali, Gitarama and a big portion of Ruhengeri. 
Sindikubwabo no longer controls 10 prefectures, but five which 
he does not control completely. He controls Gisenyi, Kibuye, 
Cyangugu, and Gikongoro. He does not really control Butare as we 
occupy many of the prefecture's communes. 
  By saying that he is just camping in Gitarama and that he 
will continue his journey to other prefectures, Sindikubwabo 
should remember that the liberation campaign is continuing and 
that the RPF is keeping up its campaign to rescue innocent 
people still being killed. 
  In an interview with Radio France International, 
Sindikubwabo 
said the loss of Gitarama is an important setback, politically 
and militarily. No one knows when he became a soldier. 
However, this explains why his troops continue to be defeated 
as though they were not present. 
  In short, Sindikubwabo, with a sad voice, at least accepted 
that if Gitarama has been captured then things are serious. 
Speaking in French, he said it is serious. He said this is 
because troops in all areas -- the south, Kigali, the north -- 
are no longer in contact. [passage omitted].

  [Text] In Zaire, the new parliament, the High Council of 
the Republic - Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT] this afternoon 
initiated the process for the election of a new prime minister. 
Herve de Guelinck reports: 
  [Guelinck] The HCR-PT has accepted the candidature of seven 
candidates for the post of prime minister. Etienne Tshisekedi, 
the opposition leader and the prime minister elected in August 
1992 by the sovereign national conference, is no longer in the 
race: He still sees himself as the elected prime minister and 
not as a candidate. Among the seven candidates which have been 
accepted are three former prime ministers, including Kengo Wa 
Dondo, who has a reputation for being a good manager and who 
would be likely to restore the trust of international monetary 
institutions. According to our information, the introduction of 
the candidates started this afternoon although there is not yet 
a quorum of two-thirds of councillors; some 40 are reported to 
be missing. 
  It must be pointed that Etienne Tshisekedi's friends 
consider 
this election process illegal and are keeping away from the 
session. If there is a quorum of two-thirds this afternoon, a 
vote will be held. Otherwise, it will be necessary to wait 
until tomorrow because the presence of two-thirds will no longer 
be necessary tomorrow in accordance with the internal 
regulations. 
  It must be pointed out that neither the chairman of the 
HCR-PT, Mgr Monsengwo, nor the deputy chairman representing the 
opposition, Social-Christian Joseph Ileo, are present in 
Kinshasa. This is why the HCR-PT office is currently dominated 
by President Mobutu's allies, which may account for the fact 
that, in spite of a lot of criticism, the HCR-PT is intent on 
going forward, even if this means forcing through the election 
of the prime minister.

  [Text] Pretoria June 13 SAPA -- Monday's meeting to discuss 
the Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland] issue had "digressed 
completely" from the spirit and agreement reached two weeks ago 
with President Nelson Mandela, Conservative Party [CP] leader Dr 
Ferdi Hartzenberg said in a statement. 
  Dr Hartzenberg and Freedom Front [FF] leader Gen Constand 
Viljoen met Deputy President Thabo Mbeki at Pretoria's Union 
Buildings on Monday to discuss the formation of a volkstaat. 
  A joint statement issued afterwards said the CP was to make 
direct representation to the Constitutional Assembly regarding 
the formation of a volkstaat. The CP would also pursue the 
matter with the various parties represented in the government of 
national unity. 
  It said the CP's request to negotiate directly with the 
government -- originally communicated to President Mandela -- 
would be conveyed to the cabinet for its consideration. "The 
meeting recognised the fact that the constitution provided for a 
mechanism and a process to address the question of a volkstaat," 
the joint statement said. 
  But in a separate statement issued later, Dr Hartzenberg 
said 
the discussions had "digressed completely" from the spirit and 
agreement reached two weeks ago with Mr Mandela. 
  During those discussions direct negotiation between the 
CP/Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front -- AVF] and the 
government had been agreed on. Other interested parties would 
be able to take part and a forum would be established for this 
purpose, Dr Hartzenberg said. "Today the standpoint was taken 
that all negotiations must be done through the volkstaat council 
[VC]. This is unacceptable to the CP and the AVF because the VC 
has been appointed only by the Freedom Front and because it is 
inherently limited by the... constitution as well as the 
agreement between Gen Viljoen and the ANC." 
  Dr Hartzenberg said these limitations precluded full 
political independence for Afrikaners and a further interview 
would have to be held with President Mandela. 
  In order to ensure a permanent solution and lasting peace it 
was essential the agreement already reached with President 
Mandela be honoured and executed, he said.

<F P=106> [By Sven Lunsche] </F>
  [Text] Almost R65-billion [rand] will be spent on social 
services in fiscal 1994/95, most of it coming from existing 
programmes, according to preliminary estimates. The share of 
total state spending going to social services has risen markedly 
over the past few years. In the 1993/94 Budget 44 percent of 
spending was allocated to social services. 
  If a similar percentage is applied to this year's 
R125-billion Budget then social services will cost about 
R55-billion. 
  Such spending should go a long way in helping the government 
get its reconstruction and development programme (RDP) off the 
ground. Included in the funds is money earmarked for spending on 
education, housing, social security and welfare, health 
facilities, electrification, small business and job creation. 
  The government has announced the establishment of a 
R2.5-billion RDP fund as part of the 1994/95 Budget, jointly 
administered by Minister without Portfolio, Jay Naidoo, and 
Finance Minister Derek Keys. Money from this fund is to be used 
as "seed money", says Bernie Fanaroff, an adviser to Mr Naidoo. 
  Mr Fanaroff sees the two main functions of the RDP fund as a 
kick-start for development projects and reemphasising spending 
priorities within existing government departments. He says the 
government will be looking at the provinces to provide "coherent 
and integrated projects within the RDP". 
  Analysts say that the key to the success of the RDP will be 
a 
shift in spending priorities within government departments. If 
previous trends are maintained this year, less than 10 percent 
of this amount will be capital expenditure, but analysts point 
out that salaries of teachers, for example, are a key to the 
success of education projects. 
  Billions of rands in development finance have also been set 
aside by parastatal institutions. The largest of these, the 
Development Bank, financed projects valued at R1.75-billion in 
1993/94 and arranged an additional R750-million from other 
borrowers. 
  A spokesman says that similar amounts could be expected this 
year. 
  Jolyon Nuttall, communications director of the Independent 
Development Trust (IDT), says that the IDT plans to disburse 
over R530-million for calendar 1994. 
  The provision of electricity to 350,000 homes, one of the 
short- term objectives of the RDP, could cost up to 
R1.5-billion, but Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission] has 
stated that it will be able to meet this target. 
  The biggest question mark hangs over foreign aid. 
Provisional figures released by the Department of Foreign 
Affairs show that almost R4-billion in aid and concessionary 
loan finance had been guaranteed by foreign governments soon 
after the elections. 
  Most of this money will be spread over a period of up to 
three years and at most a third will be available this year. 
  Mr Fanaroff says only grant aid would be added to the RDP 
fund and that the government was drawing up guidelines to 
evaluate foreign aid.

  [Text] Johannesburg June 13 SAPA -- A rise in inflation 
would negate the success of the new government's Reconstruction 
and Development Programme [RDP], Deputy Finance Minister Alec 
Erwin warned Monday [13 June]. "Its (the RDP) effect will be 
retarded if inflation erodes the real income earned in newly 
created jobs or micro and small enterprises, areas which are 
most vulnerable to inflation," he said. 
  Consequently, President Nelson Mandela and the cabinet were 
"unquestionably" committed to ongoing monetary and fiscal 
discipline. "We all agree that we need reconstruction... but, 
in government we accept that we cannot spend our way to these 
objectives," he told the opening of the new headquarters of the 
International Bank of Southern Africa in Johannesburg. 
  A ballooning fiscal deficit would likely increase 
inflationary pressures and thus would also harm the ability of 
South Africa's industries to restructure in a highly competitive 
global environment. "It (industry restructuring) will not 
succeed if domestic prices rise more rapidly than international 
prices," he said. 
  Mr Erwin said a comprehensive and precise white paper on the 
RDP was being prepared for tabling in Parliament, which would 
include proposals on the RDP fund. 
  Government would Allocate R2.5-billion [rand] in the 
upcoming 
budget to the fund, and it could be supplemented by 
international grant aid and private sector assistance. The 
state's committment would be derived from departmental savings 
and re-allocations in the budget to be presented on June 22. 
  "These funds will go back through government line 
departments 
at national, provincial and local level to kickstart the 
reordering of priorities in the areas indentified in the 
president's state of the nation address," Mr Erwin said. 
  The government also intended to augment domestic savings 
with 
foreign capital resources once the preparations for a 
comprehensive RDP had been completed. 
  The government is awaiting an international credit rating 
assessment before approaching global capital markets to raise 
financing. 
  "(In addition), there is likely to be a considerable 
increase 
in demand for corporate, trade and structured financing and we 
welcome the role that international bank and the three major 
European banking houses it represents will play in this regard," 
he said. 
  Germany's Dresdner Bank AG, France's Banque Nationale de 
Paris and Belgium's Banque Bruxelles Lambert are the three 
shareholders in the Johannesburg-based international bank. 
  The opening of the bank's new premises was attended by 
senior 
executives from all three financial institutions. 
  "We hope to play a role in facilitating SA's re-entry into 
the global financial community, working alongside established 
local banks," Dresdner Bank AG international head Volker 
Burghagen told reporters earlier. 
  "Sa needs international investment and we hope to be a link 
in the chain that brings it... We are also ready to serve 
leading SA companies in their domestic markets and as they take 
advantage of new international opportunities."

  [Text] Cape Town June 13 SAPA -- Diverting resources from 
defence to the government's Reconstruction and Development 
Programme [RDP] would enhance rather than undermine South 
Africans' security, military analyst Laurie Nathan said on 
Monday. Mr Nathan, director of the Cape-Town based Centre for 
Conflict Resolution, said a number of arguments had been 
presented in recent weeks for maintaining or increasing the 
defence budget. 
  The argument that it was necessary to maintain a credible 
defence capability was correct as a general principle, but its 
application depended on circumstances. South Africa was 
over-armed in the regional context as none of the Southern 
Africa Development Community states was capable of posing a 
military threat. There was no foreseeable military threat from 
outside the region. 
  "The potential in fact exists for a high level of political, 
diplomatic and security co-operation in the post-apartheid 
southern Africa," he said. 
  "Disarmament in South Africa would facilitate disarmament 
throughout the subcontinent, releasing resources for development 
and potentially leading to greater internal stability." 
  In South Africa the greatest threats to citizens' security 
were non-military problems such as poverty, unemployment and a 
lack of adequate social services. 
  "The bottom line is that money spent on defence could 
otherwise have been used for development programmes and welfare 
services," Mr Nathan said. 
  To argue that South Africa's foreign policy, particularly in 
southern Africa, would depend heavily on a military role was 
dangerously close to South Africa's regional policy under 
apartheid and would undermine regional confidence. 
  To claims that the defence budget, at 2.6 per cent of gross 
national product, was not high by international standards, Mr 
Nathan said the United Nations and World Bank considered two per 
cent an acceptable figure for developing countries. 
  "This benchmark should be regarded as a general guideline 
rather than a fixed rule," he said. "It may in fact be too high 
in the case of South Africa since current defence spending is 
several times greater than total military expenditure in the 
rest of the region." 
  Noting that in 1992/93 Armscor [Armaments Corporation of 
South Africa] had made R110 million [rand] from domestic and 
foreign sales and received a state subsidy of R10 million, he 
said it was "untenable" to say ethical considerations should 
play no part in the arms trade. 
  Weapons were not a neutral commodity and it was not "overly 
pious" to ask whether South Africa wanted to boost its economy 
through killings in other countries. 
  The defence establishment could not seek to maintain a large 
budget on the grounds of international instability and 
simultaneously contribute to that instability through arms 
exports. 
  Mr Nathan said South Africa had to establish clear foreign 
and national security policies and conduct a transparent 
investigation of its arms industry before it could make rational 
decisions about the defence budget. 
  It required a clear policy on arms exports and a way of 
overseeing whatever criteria were laid down. Ways to cut the 
defence budget should also be investigated. 
  All of these objectives should be open to public debate, he 
said.

  [Text] Cape Town June 10 SAPA -- The positive response of 
South African business to the Reconstruction and Development 
Programme would hasten lifting exchange control regulations, 
Trade Minister Trevor Manuel said on Friday [10 June]. Speaking 
at a press conference at the World Economic Forum summit in Cape 
Town he said the African National Congress' economics department 
and Finance Minister Derek Keys believed the controls should be 
lifted as soon as possible. The way South African Business 
responded to the political transition was going to be a key 
determinant of this. 
  Mr Manuel welcomed their response to the programme and their 
willingness to establish a fund for it. "I think political 
certainty will also see more investment by South African 
corporations in new opportunities. All that will hasten the 
date by which we will be able to announce the lifting of 
exchange controls. It is a matter under discussion." 
  Vice-chairman of the United States-based Citicorp and 
Citibank Bill Rhodes told journalists he was "very impressed" 
with the realism of the new government. South Africa needed to 
demonstrate it would continue to show fiscal and monetary 
discipline to obtain a positive credit rating in international 
markets. He said Citicorp had recently been granted a licence 
to open a representative office in South Africa and hoped to be 
able to do so in the next few months. It was already allocating 
funds to trade finance facilities. He sensed a strong 
recognition by the South African Government that they needed to 
maintain the balance between economic reforms and providing 
social necessities. 
  Mr Manuel said funds raised by merchant banks in the US for 
investment in South Africa had done exceedingly well. "They've 
surpassed expectations. That must say something about the way 
people are reading the moment in South Africa."

  [Text] Cape Town June 10 SAPA -- There could be room for 
privatisation in South Africa but it should not be regarded as a 
panacea, minister of trade and industry Mr Trevor Manuel said on 
Friday [10 June]. Addressing a press conference at the World 
Economic Forum summit in Cape Town he said that for a number of 
people in the world privatisation was an ideological instrument. 
"If that is the objective then clearly it has no future and 
clearly it is going to come unstuck in the same way 
nationalisation came unstuck," he said. If any of South Africa's 
commercialised institutions could be disposed of for specific 
objectives, such as raising capital or advancing affirmative 
action, this would have to be looked at on merit. But we don't 
believe in magic wands," he said. 
  He indicated that bodies such as Eskom [Electricity Supply 
Commission] and the South African Commuter Rail Corporation 
could not be privatised because they were needed as parastatals 
to address imbalances caused by years of apartheid. However, 
there could be other entities that might garner a different view 
from the government. 
  "I've said before, I don't feel passionately attached to 
Mossgas [Mossel Bay Gas Project]. The problem is that those 
offering privatisation as a method is that they are not 
interested in Mossgas because it is a loss-maker," he added.

  [Text] Trade and Industry Minister Trevor Manuel has said 
in Cape Town that trade agreements between South Africa and its 
neighbors will have to be renegotiated. Addressing a news 
conference, Mr. Manuel said that this did not mean that existing 
contractual agreements with neighboring countries like Botswana, 
Lesotho, and Swaziland in the Customs Union will have to be 
neglected. Existing structures like the Customs Union and the 
Preferential Trade Agreement with Zimbabwe would not necessarily 
be changed or phased out. Mr. Manuel said emphasis in this 
exercise will be on consultation and on the harmonization of 
existing and new trade links. Mr. Manuel said South Africa was 
almost certain to join the Southern African Development 
Community, SADC, during the organization's summit meeting in 
August.

<F P=106> [By Farouk Chothia] </F>
  [Text] New Minister of Land Affairs Derek Hanekom has said 
he favours the implementation of a land tax and will be setting 
up a committee in the next two months to investigate its 
feasibility. He said that although a land tax would not provide 
a source of central state revenue, it would encourage farmers to 
use land productively. "If they do well, the percentage of 
income which goes to tax would go down. This would encourage 
people to either produce more efficiently and increase their 
income...or, if they can't do this, it will be an incentive for 
them to sell or lease. Such a tax would provide revenue for 
local government." 
  He conceded that although he personally favoured a land tax, 
its benefits had to be weighed against administration costs and 
resistance to it from farmers. 
  This weekend, the new minister and his department are to 
hold 
a workshop to identify key problems facing them and what 
restructuring will be necessary to meet the challenges ahead. 
  An obvious one is managing the land reform process so that, 
as Hanekom put is, "we succeed in meeting our objectives without 
threatening farmers". The objectives, according to the RDP 
[Reconstruction Development Plan], are to address land claims 
resulting from apartheid dispossession and dating from 1913, and 
to redistribute 30 percent of South Africa's productive land 
within five years. 
  Hanekom has identified the land restitution leg of land 
reform as a priority. He said his department already had 90 
rural restitution cases which are not being handled by the 
Commission on Land Allocation. They are dealing with these, and 
others which are with the Commission and which can be resolved 
through negotiation. Cases where there is no prospect of a 
local solution will have to wait for the Land Claims Court. 
  He also wanted his department to take responsibility for the 
rural development aspects of the RDP and to link this to 
restitution cases for the rest of 1994. "The RDP won't 
immediately be able to deliver mass basic services to rural 
areas. But rural people who get back their land need basic 
infrastructure such as water and roads." 
  Hanekom's department's current budget is R68-million [rand], 
but he said he'll be asking for another R250-million to carry 
out land reform for the 1994/1995 financial year. 
  A White Paper on Land Reform would come out early next year, 
detailing the government's overall land reform programme.

<F P=106> [Report by Louise Marsland] </F>
  [Text] The boundaries of towns and suburbs in and around 
Johannesburg are to be redrawn in a bid to create new nonracial 
municipalities for the region, but recommendations put forward 
by the statutory and political bodies involved differ 
substantially. A common theme in creating the new towns, 
however, is that emphasis has firmly been placed on 
socio-economic and demographic considerations. The new 
municipal areas have to be economically viable and represent a 
fair population mix of both rich and poor, thereby equally 
distributing the burden of reconstruction, according to sources 
within the Central Witwatersrand Metropolitan Chamber 
negotiating forum. 
  A transitional metropolitan council (TMC) for the central 
Witwatersrand area is due to be in place within weeks to oversee 
the creation of non-racial town councils in the area and prepare 
for local government elections next year. Johannesburg and 
Soweto are one of several major urban areas which will have a 
metropolitan council to assist in the integration and 
co-ordination of urban economies. It will legislate over the 
town councils in its metropolitical jurisdiction. 
  The Metropolitan Chamber negotiating forum is busy drawing 
up 
the internal and external boundaries of the TMC, which will 
legislate for the present areas of Greater Johannesburg and 
Soweto. 
  In the next few weeks there will be intense debate on the 
proposals handed in by the city and town councils, and on the 
proposals to be handed in next week by the ANC and its alliance 
of civic organisations. 
  There are two major points of departure that have to be 
ironed out before a final constitution for the TMC and its 
metropolitan substructures (municipalities) is mapped out. One 
is the power to be vested in the metropolitan authority, 
including who gets to redistribute the revenue generated in the 
region, and the other is the size of the new municipalities. 
  The statutory side have proposed that the present racially 
fragmented system of local government in the province be 
rationalised by establishing eight local councils on the basis 
of redrawn boundaries. The approximate size of each new 
municipality would be 400,000 people per local council, although 
they would differ in size. 
  Dr Harry Formanek, who represents several Randburg ratepayer 
and resident federations and sits on the Metropolitan Chamber 
committee responsible for investigating new boundaries, warns 
that the maps being released now are merely scenarios and will 
still change significantly. "There are maps floating around all 
over the place and everyone has a different idea. These are 
proposals based on economic reality and boundary reality," he 
says. 
  The city and town councils also want future local councils 
to control their own budgets, subject to the obligation to 
deliver the minimum standards of service set out by the 
metropolitan government; separate administrative infrastructure 
for the metropolitan government and the local councils to 
perform the powers and functions allocated to them; and a single 
metropolitan-wide property valuation roll. 
  It is known that the non-statutory bodies on the 
Metropolitan 
Chamber believe that all revenue generated by the new municipal 
areas should be given to the TMC on the basis of one 
municipality, one tax base, to redistribute the money where 
needed. 
  The ANC and its alliance partners in the Metropolitan 
Chamber 
are expected to table the creation of more than 12 new 
municipalities under the Witwatersrand metropolitan council, 
each with about 200,000 people within their boundaries. They 
also want "all powers currently exercised by apartheid local 
authorities and bodies to the immediately transferred to the 
TMC". The ANC and its partners also believe that attacking 
poverty and deprivation will be the first priority of the TMC. 
  The statutory side also propose that "administrator bodies" 
be appointed for the existing local authorities to oversee the 
transfer of assets, rights and obligations to the TMC and 
relevant local councils, oversee budgets and ensure the 
continuation of services while the existing segregated councils 
are being dissolved. It has also been proposed that a 
reconstruction and development programme be agreed on for 
immediate implementation and a strategic management team be 
appointed to look after the metropolitan change-management 
process. 
  Once the transitional metropolitan and municipal structures 
are in place in the Witwatersrand area -- hopefully before the 
end of the year -- the boundaries will be finalised and 
preparation for elections will begin. The holding of elections 
and the setting up of final structures is expected to take place 
in the second half of next year. 
  The statutory bodies propose that 30 members be nominated by 
the Central Witwatersrand Metropolitan Chamber negotiating forum 
for each local council in the transitional phase and 60 members 
nominated for the TMC, with 10 elected for the TMC executive 
committee. 
  Formanek urges all community organisations to get themselves 
involved now by attending the Metropolitan Chamber subcommittees 
on boundaries. "We need meaningful input and there is a 
distinct lack of community-based organisations on these forums. 
We need people to become involved now."

  [Text] Johannesburg June 11 SAPA -- There could be 
countrywide unrest in mines, after the accusation by black 
mineworkers that white workers were hoisted to the surface 
before them after a shift, the white Mineworkers' Union said on 
Friday [10 June]. 
  The union's general secretary, Mr Peet Ungerer, said that at 
several mines, white workers had been threatened, assaulted and 
prevented from going to work. He said the union rejected the 
allegations of racism. 
  It had been the custom for many years for workers with 
higher 
grades to be hoisted to the surface first because they had to 
discuss production reports with senior officials, he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Lulama Luti] </F>
  [Text] Hundreds of refugees fleeing civil wars and famine 
in most African countries are streaming into South Africa, 
penniless, and many are roaming the streets without any place to 
stay. 
  The Department of Home Affairs is presently processing 
application from more than 2,000 refugees seeking political 
asylum in the country. 
  The flood of refugees is causing serious problems for the 
South African authorities, who are still grappling with the 
issue of displaced people from violence-ravaged areas such as 
Natal and the East Rand. 
  There has been a steady increase in the number of people 
seeking refuge from wars and famine in Africa in the past few 
months. 
  Some have found their way to centres for the homeless such 
as 
the Welcome Home Centre in Doornfontein, Johannesburg. 
  The centre, which is home to about 300 homeless people, also 
houses about 70 refugees from countries such as Somalia, 
Ethiopia, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique 
and Tanzania. 
  The refugees included five Ethiopian dissident boxers who 
fled from a Mauritius-bound aircraft at Jan Smuts Airport on May 
15 while en route to a boxing tournament in Mauritius. 
  Most of the asylum seekers had letters from the United 
Nations High Commission for Refugees and the Department of Home 
Affairs, identifying them as people applying for refugee status. 
  The director of the centre, Mrs Imelda Damane, said the 
UNHCR 
[UN High Commission for Refugees] sent refugees to the centre 
without providing them with money for food and shelter. 
  "How do they expect us to cope with this flood of people 
when 
we can't provide for local people who have fled their homes 
because of violence"? Damane said. 
  A spokesman for the UNHCR denied that the organisation 
referred people to the centre. He said the name of the centre 
was one of several appearing on a list supplied to refugees to 
help them find food and shelter. 
  According to an agreement with the Government, asylum 
seekers 
are allowed to look for employment while their applications are 
being processed. He said the UNHCR did not have any direct 
assistance programme for refugees. 
  The Department of Home Affairs said a total of 2,146 persons 
from various countries had applied at its Johannesburg office 
for asylum on the grounds that they were refugees. 
  Such applicants were issued with temporary permits pending 
the outcome of their applications. If successful, the refugees 
were granted temporary residence. 
  The department said it was impossible to give exact figures 
of refugees because many entered the country clandestinely.

  [Text] Cape Town June 10 SAPA -- Deputy President F W de 
Klerk said on Friday [10 June] that after he had been given 
certain assurances by President Nelson Mandela he was convinced 
the government would be able to reach consensus on the issue of 
amnesty and indemnity for political crimes committed in the 
past. In response to questions at a press conference at the 
World Economic Forum [WEF] conference in Cape Town, he said the 
proposed "truth commission" as announced this week by the 
Minister of Justice Dullah Omar had not been "agreed- upon 
policy". He, Mr de Klerk, had not been consulted about the 
announcement. But ministers in the government of national unity 
had been charged with looking at the matter from all angles and 
had to "come up with a co-ordinated approach". 
  Mr de Klerk said Mr Omar's announcement should be seen as 
"part of growing pains", but it should be remembered that Mr 
Omar had said he was putting on the table a basic approach. Mr 
Omar had made it clear a final decision would be taken only 
after all views had been gathered and presented to the 
government. It was not a sign of tension in the government, Mr 
de Klerk said. 
  Mr Omar had also said in Parliament that the government was 
not looking for a witch-hunt or Nuremburg-style trials. 
  Mr de Klerk said he had spoken "cursorally" to Mr Mandela 
and 
Mr Mandela had given him certain assurances about details "which 
convinces me we will be able to reach some kind of consensus on 
this issue". 
  Mr de Klerk said he would be telling a WEF open session on 
Friday night that South Africa's past would have to be dealt 
with in such a way that "we don't get involved in vendettas and 
witch-hunts". 
  Asked about possible pitfalls, Mr de Klerk said a truth 
commission would not promote reconciliation if double standards 
were applied. But he did not wish to enter into a debate 
through the media while negotiations on the issue were under way. 
  "Whatever is decided must promote reconciliation."

  [Text] Cape Town June 10 SAPA -- First Deputy President 
Thabo Mbeki publicly took his colleague F W de Klerk to task on 
Friday [10 June] for suggesting a truth commission could 
undermine the goodwill and sense of national unity which had 
begun to take root since President Nelson Mandela's inauguration. 
  Addressing the World Economic Forum summit in Cape Town, Mr 
de Klerk told international business leaders that South Africa 
would be foolish if it "precipitately tore out the stitches from 
wounds which are only now beginning to heal". 
  But Mr Mbeki, speaking from the same platform, said his 
sister-in-law was still looking for her unionist husband who had 
disappeared without trace in Durban about seven years ago. "We 
are trying to find him and we are hoping somewhere in South 
Africa there is somebody who knows what happened, who will come 
and say I am sorry...because of the particular times in which we 
were, we took him and because of who he was and what he was 
doing, given those times, unfortunately we got rid of him. 
That's why you can't find him. Because then his wife and two 
children can at last say he is dead and do whatever custom and 
tradition demand they do in the circumstances. It's that kind 
of truth, (Deputy) President de Klerk, that we are looking for." 
His sister-in-law could then become part of the process of 
national reconciliation, Mr Mbeki added. 
  Earlier, Mr de Klerk said South Africa had to be very 
careful 
how it approached sensitive questions relating to the past, 
particularly with regard to amnesty, indemnity and the truth 
commission. "We agree that processes have to be developed to 
put the political crimes of the past behind us once and for all, 
that the wounds of the past must be healed. But such a process 
cannot be allowed to develop into a tug of war or even a running 
sore which might continue to suppurate for years." The reality, 
he said, was that during the past conflict, unacceptable crimes 
were committed by followers of all sides and factions. "We have 
just completed four years of hard negotiation aimed at resolving 
that conflict. We would be foolish if we precipitately tore out 
the stitches from wounds which are only now beginning to heal." 
  Mr de Klerk also said it was important that South Africa 
"build well" and not make basic errors that could weaken its 
national structure in the future. He had no problem with 
affirmative action, but the country should be very careful about 
the way it implemented such programmes, and dared not throw 
merit out of the window. "Instead of drifting into new 
state-sponsored discrimination against some members of our 
society, we should redouble our efforts to remove any vestiges 
of discrimination against any South African." 
  Other issues that would have to be handled with sensitivity 
and care were land ownership, financial discipline, the size of 
the civil service and the funding of the Reconstruction and 
Development Programme.

  [Text] The SANDF [South African National Defense Force] 
says that almost half of the MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of 
the Nation; ANC Military Wing] members who reported to the 
Wallmannstal assembly point north east of Pretoria had to be 
turned away. 
  The SANDF said that their names had not been on the list 
provided by Umkhonto we Sizwe. In terms of constitutional 
discussions, this list was to have been provided by each armed 
movement including MK and the former TBVC [Transkei, 
Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] countries. Earlier, the ANC 
criticized the chief of the defense force because MK officers 
had not been accepted by the SANDF. Two-hundred fifty youths 
claiming to MK members demonstrated in front of the ANC 
headquarters in Johannesburg because the SANDF had turned them 
away.

  [Text] Pretoria June 10 SAPA -- Minister of Defence Joe 
Modise on Friday [10 June] backtracked from further action 
against the WEEKLY MAIL newspaper, saying he would decide on 
future steps about a possible report by the publication after he 
had studied all aspects. 
  The tabloid was served papers on Thursday informing it of Mr 
Modise's intention to seek an interdict to restrain it from 
publishing further stories on the South African Defence Force's 
former Directorate of Covert Collection (DCC). The story, 
published for the first time last week, deals with 23 former 
members of the directorate who were dismissed by former State 
President F W de Klerk in 1992. 
  Responding to the furore over the legal action, Mr Modise 
said he was approached on Thursday by SANDF [South African 
National Defense Force] head Gen Georg Meiring for permission to 
serve an interdict on the paper. "I granted this permission 
because I did not wish to read in newspapers about covert 
matters pertaining to my department about which I had not yet 
been briefed. The reason for this decision was so I could call 
for reports, both from the Defence Force and the respondents. 
Only when I have all the relevant information laid before me 
will I be in a position to decide what steps I will take," he 
said in a statement from Pretoria. 
  Earlier on Friday, the African National Congress criticised 
the minister for launching legal action against the WEEKLY MAIL. 
"ANC policy is unequivocally for full disclosure of past covert 
action and exposure of dirty tricks against the democratic 
movement," the organisation said in a statement on Friday. "We 
have conducted our struggle to achieve a democratic and open 
society. South Africans voted for a fully transparent process 
of government. We are, therefore, concerned that this principle 
is being compromised by the minister of defence's attempt to 
interdict the WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN," the statement said. 
  Urging the ministry to withdraw the interdict and drop the 
case in the Pretoria Supreme Court "without delay", it said no 
further action should be taken using the defence of freedom of 
information acts until the acts had been re-evaluated.

  [Text] Defense Minister Joe Modise is to have last week's 
interdict against the WEEKLY MAIL withdrawn. 
  The court interdict was to prevent the paper from publishing 
information about former members of the defense force's 
Directorate of Covert Collection. The information concerned 
allegations that certain members of the ANC alliance, the PAC 
[Pan-Africanist Congress] and others had acted as informants of 
the apartheid state. Mr. Joe Modise said the information can be 
published as it doesn't pose a threat to the democratic 
transition. In a statement, the minister reiterated his 
commitment to the principle of press freedom.

<F P=106> [Report by Gallie van Rensburg] </F>
  [Text] President Nelson Mandela has decided to take up 
permanent residence at Libertas in Pretoria. 
  This means that Deputy President F.W. de Klerk will have to 
find a new residence. 
  According to information released to BEELD, Deputy President 
de Klerk will occupy Overvaal, the former administrator's 
residence in Pretoria. 
  Mr. Joel Netshitenzhe, President Mandela's spokesman, 
yesterday confirmed that President Mandela had decided on 
Libertas. President Mandela temporarily stayed at the 
Presidency on the Bryntirion Estate while he was considering a 
house in Pretoria. 
  Mr. Netshitenzhe said it would depend on discussions between 
Mr. Mandela and Mr. de Klerk when Mr. Mandela would move into 
Libertas. 
  It could perhaps happen around the end of the year, after 
the 
close of the parliamentary session, BEELD was told. 
  Deputy President Thabo Mbeki still lives in Johannesburg. He 
is considering various options in Pretoria. One of them is 
Goede Hoop, also on the Bryntirion Estate, a spokesman from his 
office said. 
  The Presidency had earlier been the official residence of 
the 
state president in the days when South Africa still had a state 
president and a prime minister. The prime minister then lived 
at Libertas. 
  When President P.W. Botha became the first executive 
president, he stayed on at Libertas. 
  The Presidency had thereafter been used as a state guest 
house and a conference center. 
  People who have been in both say the Presidency is a 
"coldish 
place with large rooms," while Libertas is a "warm and 
comfortable house." 
  Mrs. Marike de Klerk, De Klerk's wife, helped to restore 
Libertas. Earlier this year the house was declared a national 
monument.

Minister Winnie Mandela has hit back at allegations of 
overspending during her stay in Cape Town for the opening of 
Parliament. 
  According to newspaper reports, her hotel bill came to more 
than 12,000 rands. Mrs. Mandela said that by asking the state 
to give a ruling on who should pay the account, Education 
Director Bernard Louw was trying to undermine her position and 
embarrass her. Mrs. Mandela said the newspaper reports were 
incorrect, but did not elaborate other than to say that she had 
been accompanied by four bodyguards, and not eight.

<F P=106> [By Farouk Chotia, Chris Louw, and Mondli waka Makhanya] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Democratic Party [DP], still reeling from its 
April election disaster, is facing a fresh wave of ructions and 
defections in its ranks that threaten the party's survival. 
  In the past week: 
  -- It has had to disband its caucus in the Cape Town city 
council, it lost a key member to the ANC and will have to face a 
challenge from a new coalition being formed to fight the 
upcoming local authority elections. 
  -- In Natal, five Durban city-councillors resigned from the 
DP's regional executive committee in protest against the 
nomination of Eastern Cape farmer Errol Moorcroft as senator for 
KwaZulu/Natal. 
  -- And in Johannesburg, DP management committee chairman Ian 
Davidson was caught in a bruising fight with Premier Tokyo 
Sexwale over the destruction of squatter shacks on a cold winter 
day. The incident was enough for party stalwart Helen Suzman to 
criticise the DP-controlled city council harshly. 
  These setbacks in three of the DP's strongest regions follow 
a bruising in the April election. The DP had hoped to hold the 
balance of power in the 42 member Western Cape provincial 
legislature but in the end only managed to get three seats. 
This led to the resignation of party leader Zach de Beer and 
the election of the controversial Tony Leon as interim leader. 
  It now risks being obliterated in Cape town and Durban when 
municipal elections take place in a year's time. "Its white 
support base is eroding and they haven't even started making 
inroads into areas where most people live," notes one observer. 
  In KwaZulu/Natal the unhappiness about the election of 
Moorcroft as the single DP senator for the province has led to 
rumours that the "old boys club" was in action again. It is 
suggested that Moorcroft has suffered financial losses through 
investments in the Lloyds insurance company and that he had the 
active help of DP federal chairman Ken Andrew -- who lost money 
in the same way -- to be elected into his position in order to 
bail him out. Andrew and Moorcroft are known to be close 
friends. 
  Andrew denied he took part in any "concerted effort" to get 
Moorcroft elected. He insisted Moorcroft was chosen on merit, 
but admitted that it was he who had suggested to Moorcroft that 
he made himself available as Natal senator. He said though it 
was true that both Moorcroft and he had lost money in Lloyds -- 
and that there may be a "fair" overlap in the agencies handling 
their affairs -- neither was in financial trouble. [passage

  [Text] The leadership of the National Patriotic Front of 
Liberia [NPFL] says one of its ministers in the transitional 
government is continuing to undermine the goals of the NPFL. 
The NPFL says it has identified this minister, who continues to 
(?propagate) lies and deception against the interests of the 
organization. 
  The NPFL says this minister in question has been 
collaborating with ECOMOG [Economic Community of West Africa 
States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] to carry out a diabolical 
plan to arrest NPFL officials in Monrovia, exposed the minister 
involved [sentence as heard]. Although the minister was not 
openly identified, last week press reports in Monrovia quoted 
Internal Affairs Minister Samuel Dhokie opposing the calls by 
the leadership of the NPFL for the formation of a transitional 
army to defend the sovereignty of Liberia in the wake of threats 
by Nigeria-dominated alien army. 
  Minister Dhokie said he is opposed to the idea of the 
formation of a national army until disarmament and internment 
are completed. Political observers are questioning the motive of 
Minister Dhokie in opposing the idea of a national army [words 
indistinct] for an organization he represents. The observers 
say Minister Dhokie must be clear on who he represents in the 
LNTG [Liberia National Transitional Government], as his 
pronouncements can only make anyone to believe that he is 
representing himself. 
  Meanwhile, the leadership of the NPFL has expressed alarm 
and 
concern over the sweeping wave of arrests of Liberians in 
Monrovia by ECOMOG. The citizens are being subjected to forced 
labor by ECOMOG in Monrovia.

  [Text] Bujumbura, 13 Jun (PANA) -- An armed attack on 
Monday [13 June] morning killed fifteen civilians and seriously 
wounded five in the center of Kayanza, a town in the central 
Burundian province of Kayanza, at the border with Butare 
(southern Rwanda), Burundian radio announced on Monday. 
  Quoting the Kayanza District commander, the radio added that 
the streets of the town were deserted. The inhabitants who were 
surprised in their sleep by the attack remained at home waiting 
for calm to return. 
  A similar attack occurred last weekend when grenades were 
thrown into a pub, seriously wounding eleven people, one of whom 
died in hospital and two are still in a critical state, medical 
sources said. Since Friday, violent clashes have been taking 
place between the regular Army and armed gangs based on the 
hills around Bujumbura, the Burundian capital. 
  Burundian radio, quoting military sources, said the death 
toll was six among the assailants and two among the military. 
  Interim president Sylvestre Ntibantunganya is currently in 
Tunis attending the 30th summit of OAU heads of states and 
governments.

  [Text] Pretoria June 13 SAPA -- The Conservative Party [CP] 
is to make direct representation to the constitutional assembly 
for the formation of an Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland]. This was 
agreed to on Monday [13 June] when CP leader Dr Ferdi 
Hartzenberg and Freedom Front leader Gen Constand Viljoen met 
First Deputy President Thabo Mbeki in Pretoria. 
  A joint statement issued afterwards said the CP would also 
pursue the matter with the various parties represented in the 
government of national unity. 
  It said the CP's request to negotiate directly with the 
government -- originally communicated to President Nelson 
Mandela -- would be conveyed to the cabinet for its 
consideration. 
  "The meeting recognised the fact that the constitution 
provided for a mechanism and a process to address the question 
of a volkstaat," the statement said.

  [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] is moving its troops from Huambo to the martyred 
city of Kuito. Our correspondent Abel Abraao reports from Kuito: 
  [Abraao] The Black Cockerel troops, in a vain attempt 
to storm and take over the city of Kuito before the Lusaka talks 
are concluded, once again shelled with heavy artillery all parts 
of the capital of Bie Province, at the same time launching a 
direct attack on the positions of government forces. A reliable 
and well informed source from the operation command in Bie today 
told our newsdesk that over the past few hours Jonas Savimbi's 
organization sent five container trucks with troops carrying 
long-, medium- and short-range weapons to the outskirts of 
Kuito. The same source added that over the past 62 hours the 
government forces killed 43 UNITA rebels and captured six AKM 
weapons, two PKM's, an N-79 weapon, and an assortment of 
ammunition and anti-tank mines. 
  At present clashes are under way in the south of the 
city, with government forces inflicting heavy losses on Jonas 
Savimbi's UNITA. The Kuito residents did not go to the streets 
searching for food, wood and water this morning because UNITA 
soldiers have been shooting at everything and everyone. Thus, 
as well as civilians dying due to military activities, the 
number of people dying of famine is also growing, having reached 
alarming proportions. 
  On the southern front the situation has been described as 
stationary, judging by the movements of the UNITA rebels all 
over the region. Colonel Antonio Alberto Manuel, spokesman for 
the Southern Military Front has said these movements are taking 
part in the north of Matala District, particularly in the 
Cuvelai, Cai and Mufa areas. Our correspondent reports from the 
Huila Provincial Station in Lubango: 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The spokesman of the 
Military Southern Front says that there are three battalions of 
the rebel movement in Quilengues and two in Matala District. 
Questioned about whether the situation may become serious, Col. 
Antonio Alberto Manuel stressed that everything is serious for 
the soldiers and that everything is being done to contain this 
wave of movements. In operations mounted by government forces 
in response to UNITA attacks, a number of Jonas Savimbi's troops 
were killed, and an unspecified number of others were taken 
prisoner. 
  The Ebo District in Cuanza Sul Province is still under the 
control of the government forces despite the enemy's attempts to 
take over the city. Operation Command Spokesman Colonel Calado 
says that UNITA lost 40 soldiers when trying to carry out yet 
another criminal action against defenseless civilians. Our 
correspondent reports from Cuanza Sul: 
  [Correspondent] The Angolan Armed Forces [FAA] senior 
officer, who was speaking to our correspondent in Gabela, said 
that the dead include a lieutenant colonel who had been head of 
the Black Cockerel forces in the Eastern Front. He said violent 
and bloody clashes took place in the Canhembe, Bengo and Serra 
do Camuco areas, in which the government soldiers captured an 
assortment of war materiel, notably 13 RPG-7 weapons, eight 
AKM's and ammunition of several calibers. Colonel Calado 
concluded his interview with JORNAL DE ANGOLA by saying that 
government forces are totally in control of a radius 40 km from 
Ebo and continue with what he described as punitive attacks on 
Jonas Savimbi's soldiers in Waku Kungo, Quilenda and Ebo. 
  In Malanje, government forces this morning repelled a group 
of UNITA soldiers whey they tried to infiltrate a position of 
government forces in Cambondo. Our correspondent Francisco 
Curingana reports from the area: 
  [Curingana] On that occasion the rebels left on the 
ground 14 of their dead soldiers, 10 AK weapons, as well as an 
anti-tank missile, eight 81 mm mortar shells, and an unspecified 
number of infantry ammunition. Today, following an offensive by 
government forces, yet another eight Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola [FALA] soldiers deserted their 
colleagues and turned themselves over to government forces with 
their weapons. Over the past two days, government forces put 
out of action 151 rebels and captured seven bandits, and 39 
others turned themselves in with their weapons. FALA 90th and 
Intervention Battalions were totally defeated and withdrawn from 
the theater of war.

since the Black Cockerel troops, who have failed to take over 
the city, are now bent on transforming the city into dust 
through intense shellings into Kuito and outlying wards over the 
last 72 hours. Meanwhile, the number of victims of the shootings 
and shellings is still rising and it is estimated that more than 
500 civilians died and 800 others were wounded since 26 May. 
There is an increased number of people facing malnutrition due 
to food shortages.

  [Text] The situation has not altered in the city of Kuito. 
Clashes between government and Black Cockerel troops intensified 
since the afternoon of 12 June when about 800 men of the rebel 
organization coming from Ukuma, Huambo Province, arrived in this 
city. An Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola soldier, who 
has also come from Ukuma and asked to not to be named after 
turning himself over to government forces, due to worry 
concerning the security of his family, said the 800 soldiers of 
Jonas Savimbi have brought an assortment of war materiel carried 
by five container trucks.

international experts to look into the situation. The UNITA 
doctor pointed out that there are no doubts that the Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA] is using chemical 
bombs. He has also invited Professor (Hendrick) from the [name

victims. 
  Proof that the MPLA-Labor Party is using chemical bombs 
could

  [Text] The Supervision and Control Commission [CSC] met in 
Maputo today. It discussed incidents at assembly areas and 
freedom of movement throughout the country. At the end of the 
meeting, we spoke to Deputy Minister Tomas Salomao, who headed 
the government delegation. 
  [Salomao] The CSC approved a timetable on the closure 
of assembly areas. The government intends to complete the 
demobilization of its on troops on 15. [sentence as heard] 
The government will decide what assembly points should be 
closed down. 
  On the freedom of movement in Renamo [Mozambique 
National Resistance] areas, yet another appeal was made to 
do away with rhetoric and adopt practical solutions. We ought 
to be pragmatic. Renamo leaders have already said the areas have 
been opened. So citizens and election registration teams must 
not face problems. As a whole, this has been a constructive and 
positive session. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] At the end of a Cease-Fire 
Commission [CCF] meeting yesterday, it was reported 
that the government would confine its troops by 28 June. That 
would represent an average of 700 men daily. Do you think the 
government can do that? 
  [Salomao] It is possible. As you know, we have a 
proposal in that regard. One should take into consideration 
that there are assembly points in (?areas where troops are 
based). 
  Raul Domingos, head of the Renamo delegation, says his 
movement has once again reiterated its commitment to UN 
resolutions on the confinement and demobilization of troops. 
  [Domingos] Specifically, the meeting discussed and 
ratified a number of documents that had been dealt with by other 
commissions -- namely, the confinement and demobilization of 
troops and closure of assembly points. Renamo remains committed 
to fulfilling UN resolutions in terms of which troops should be 
confined by 1 June and demobilized by 15 July. All our troops 
have already been confined to assembly points. Our troops will 
be demobilized by 15 July [words indistinct] it is up to us to 
issue the lists. So far, the names of over 3,000 men have 
already been selected for demobilization. 
  UN Secretary General representative Aldo Ajello says the 
adoption of a timetable on the closure of assembly points was an 
important step in the timely completion of the peace process. 
  [Ajello] It has been a very positive meeting. It has 
been decided to adopt a timetable [words indistinct]. 
The timetable sets dates for the closure of assembly 
points. That is a very important step in the completion of the 
peace process as scheduled. 
  [Correspondent] The government says it will confine its 
troops by 28 June. That means the government will have to 
confine 700 men daily. Do you think the government will be able 
to meet the deadline? 
  [Ajello] It is possible. If they want to do it, then 
it is possible. If logistical conditions permit, I think it 
will be possible. I think the accord that has been signed 
reflects a commitment to confining troops as scheduled. 
  Over the past weeks the commissions did not meet 
because the government was meeting with its internal organs to 
discuss the implementation of the last phase of the peace 
process. Important decisions have been made. There is a new 
element which is very positive. The process had slowed down, 
but as of now we will see it moving rapidly. I think it will be 
possible to comply with the timetable. 
  [Correspondent] The CSC session dealt with the eternal 
problem of Renamo areas and the freedom of movement. What are 
the developments? 
  [Ajello] The information we have on freedom of movement 
in Renamo areas, particularly by electoral registration teams, 
says Gaza Province is the only area facing problems. There are 
several logistical problems -- not political problems -- in 
other parts of the country. The question of Gaza Province was 
discussed by the commission. I will gather all the necessary 
information (?from the) Renamo delegation to settle the 
dispute.

  [Text] In Maputo today, the government and Renamo 
[Mozambique National Resistance] agreed to send their men to the 
various barracks where they will wait for the start of the 
second phase of training of Mozambique Defense Armed Forces 
[FADM] personnel. 
  Sources with the Joint Commission for the Formation of the 
Mozambique Defense Armed Forces [CCFADM] say the decision is 
designed to speed up the closure of government and Renamo 
assembly points at a time when idle troops are mutinying. A 
senior government army official says that is an important 
decision and will be implemented through the creation of 
logistical conditions to receive and select personnel for the 
FADM. The sources noted that once the troops enter the 
provisional barracks, they will cease to belong to the warring 
armies and come under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Command of 
the FADM. While waiting for specialized training, the troops 
will undergo basic training provided by Mozambican instructors, 
probably advised by foreigners. 
  Today's session of the CCFADM named the first officers from 
the two sides and specified who will join the various branches 
of the FADM Supreme Command. The officers have completed a 
leadership course given by Portuguese experts. 
  Government and Renamo officers have not ruled out the 
training of the new army's 30,000 men after the October 1994 
elections. They noted, however, that a clear program has been 
adopted for the training of troops within a reasonable period. 
Renamo Major General Herminio Morais said his movement has 
already submitted the list of Renamo men that will undergo navy 
commando training at Catembe. The group will be sent to Catembe 
by UN Operations in Mozambique. The government's personnel for 
the course have already arrived in Maputo. 
  The role played by Italian military experts in the training 
of the new army will be clarified over the next two weeks.

<F P=106> [Article by AIM correspondent Santos Nhantumbo in Lisbon] </F>
  [Text] In Lisbon, Finance Minister Dr. Eneas Comiche has 
denied allegations that former Portuguese proprietors are 
repossessing their property within the framework of the 
(re)privatization process under way in Mozambique since 1987. 
  The Mozambican state has now (re)privatized about 300 small, 
medium, and large scale enterprises since the reintroduction of 
the market economy in 1987, replacing the centrally controlled 
one which was in place until 1986. 
  Eneas Comiche, who has been on a working visit to Portugal 
for two weeks now, told AIM [MOZAMBIQUE INFORMATION AGENCY] that 
current legislation practically rules that out because it puts 
foreign investors, including former Portuguese proprietors, on 
equal footing. 
  He said everyone expressing an interest in investing in 
Mozambique have been doing so under the terms of the current 
law, through tenders. He noted that potential Portuguese 
investors, including former proprietors, understand this factor. 
  The finance minister recalled Law 13-91, which confers on 
former share-holders and proprietors of enterprises the means to 
apply for the cessation of state intervention, with justifiable 
reasons of a financial, technological, or commercial nature, 
which they may be willing to render. They may be able to 
propose the continuation of its activities in association with 
Mozambican businessmen. 
  He said, "those who had any reason to benefit from what has 
been stipulated in the current law certainly did so at an 
opportune time." 
  Eneas Comiche said he expects Portuguese businessmen to be 
more effective and that they will take advantage of their 
knowledge of Mozambique and the common language, so that 
Portugal may once again become the main investor in Mozambique. 
  He recalled that "a number of Portuguese nationals have been 
involved in a study on agricultural and mineral resources among 
others, to which we have no access," noting that "this study is 
valuable." 
  Available figures state that the main foreign investor in 
Mozambique is Great Britain, followed by South Africa and 
Portugal. About 25 countries invested $700 million in Mozambique 
over the past few years, of which some $27 million is Portuguese 
capital. 
  Italy and France are also ahead in economic cooperation, and 
Eneas Comiche argues that Portugal is not taking courageous 
steps to advance further, that its political willingness has not 
been characterized by concrete actions, but he believes that the 
peace process will dissipate some concerns. 
  Comiche believes that South Africa, which occupies the 
second 
place in terms of the volume of direct investment in Mozambique, 
could do much more if there were no foreign exchange 
restrictions. 
  He said investors from that neighboring country, although 
willing to invest in Mozambique, are unable to get authorization 
from financial institutions for exporting capital. 
  The minister said this issue was discussed with South Africa 
before the democratic transition and will still be discussed 
with the South African authorities, particularly with the banks 
so that restrictions on the transfer of capital, particularly 
for investment in Mozambique are removed. 
  In terms of commercial transactions, Comiche said over the 
past few years there has been an increase in trade with South 
Africa, and there has also been an increase of imported goods 
from South Africa, but, "unfortunately, not in exports to South 
Africa." 
  He said, "it will be necessary to guarantee that there is 
not 
a big imbalance between what we are exporting and what we are 
importing from that country." 
  If from a political standpoint the success of the democratic 
process in South Africa confers stability to Mozambique and 
southern Africa, it is also true that from an economic point of 
view that historical event also creates conditions for a new 
plan of regional development and integration. 
  Similar to what is happening all over the world, Eneas 
Comiche gives priority to partners from southern Africa, "an 
area of enormous future regarding natural resources and 
competitive laborers, so that it may have a say in the continent 
and the world." 
  He said the economic situation in the country was recovering 
following the launching of the Economical Recovery Program in 
1987 which sort to correct the decline in production which was 
especially apparent between 1981 and 1986. The worst year was 
1992 when GDP was only one percent. In 1993 GDP increased by 19 
percent, the biggest rate since independence. Growth of more 
than 6 percent of GDP between 1994 and 1996 is expected. 
  Comiche also said that a restrictive policy is underway to 
reduce inflation from 44 percent in 1993 to 30 percent this year 
and 15 percent in 1996. 
  This will also include products which are not traditionally 
exported, such as electricity, which is scheduled to be supplied 
to South Africa from 1996, and the production of natural gas in 
Pande from 1998. 
  The finance minister also mentioned the National 
Reconstruction Plan, which is aimed at strengthening national 
reconciliation and democracy until 1994, and the normalization 
of the lives of the refugees, displaced people, and demobilized 
soldiers, for a period of about three years. 
  The minister says that it is estimated that $400 million 
will 
be spent per year on the National Reconstruction Plan. 
  Eneas Comiche has been in Portugal for about two weeks now 
and has already attended two seminars in Lisbon and Porto on 
opportunities for investment in Mozambique. 
  The focus of these meetings with Portuguese financial 
institutions and businessmen has been the restructuring of the 
business sector in Mozambique and the opening to the private 
sector of agriculture, tourism, mines, and banking, as well as 
the reduction of bureaucracy in the process of decision-making 
on foreign investment and the establishment of fiscal incentives 
for private investment within the framework of the economic 
opening underway in Mozambique.

  [Text] More than 300,000 Mozambicans of electoral age have 
already registered for the upcoming election in Tete, Nampula, 
and Sofala Provinces since the process began on 1 June. By 
registering, they acquire the right to participate in the first 
general multiparty elections scheduled for October. Meanwhile, 
the World Food Program has announced it will grant 330 tonnes of 
foodstuffs to assist about 7,000 electoral officers throughout 
the country. 
  Antonio Mateus Luis, Tete Provincial Elections Commission 
chairman, told NOTICIAS yesterday that 12,262 people have been 
registered for the election in the province in preparation for 
the first general multiparty elections in Mozambique. 
  Mateus said the figures could have been higher, however, 
some 
electoral teams have not yet begun functioning due to a lack of 
material conditions. He added that out of the 83 electoral 
teams established in the province, only 61 are operating due to 
problems of transportation and food faced by the electoral 
officers. Some roads are also inaccessible. 
  Luis Mateus added that in Zumbo, Magoe, and Chifunde only 
two 
electoral teams are operating. Efforts are being made, however, 
to acquire road and air transportation so that the remaining 
electoral teams can leave for areas that are difficult to access. 
  He said, "we are very worried since we do not yet have 
solutions for this problem. We are awaiting the arrival of a 
light aircraft from Maputo, and we have been contacting various 
organizations so that they can assist us with transportation." 
  He said that food and subsidy problems for the electoral 
teams are still the main "Achilles' heel" in this process, and 
according to him, the Provincial Electoral Commission is still 
awaiting the funds to be channeled by the National Elections 
Commission [CNE] according to recent pledges by that organ. 
<H5>  Nampula Records About 300,000 Citizens </H5>
  Meanwhile, eight days after the electoral registration 
began, 
Nampula Province recorded 293,795 citizens who have already 
received their voter registration card at a time when, contrary 
to what happened early, the electoral registration posts are 
experiencing an unprecedented turn out of voters, although the 
centers are still facing a number of problems. 
  All the districts in Nampula Province have given their 
report 
on the electoral registration process. The current figures, 
which refer to registration up to 8 June, do not include all the 
numbers for Monapo, Moma, and Namapa. 
  Furthermore, as a result of this, the number of electoral 
registration centers has increased from 157 on 4 June to 266, 
and another one which was not scheduled may be opened. 
  This one will operate in a Renamo [Mozambique National 
Resistance] area between Nacaroa and Memba District. The 
necessity of this was realized only now. 
  Pedro Fernandes Tauelia, a member of the Statistics 
Department of the STAE [Elections Administration Technical 
Secretariat] in Nampua said, "only lately did Renamo tell us 
that in this area many people live far from the electoral posts 
in both areas." 
  Moreover, Moma District has temporarily ceased being the 
biggest electoral registration post. As of 8 June Memba 
District became the biggest one, recording 137,878 registered 
voters, followed by Meconta District which has already 
registered 40,411 people. 
  Mozambique Isle is replacing Lalaua as the district with the 
smallest number of registered voters. It recorded 780 people 
who registered for the election. 
  Meanwhile, our newspaper has learned that the province has 
just received a light aircraft to assist in the electoral 
process in the north of the country. 
  The shortage of law and security personnel affecting the 
area 
has been overcome. A number of law and security personnel were 
sent to Ribaue and Lalawe Districts today. 
  About 30,000 people have registered for the election in 
government areas of Sofala Province, according to latest figures 
of the Provincial Elections Commission. This number does not 
include the Caia, Chemba, and Machanga Districts where voter 
registration began late. There is no information on the 
development of the process in those areas. 
  Reports from Beira say that the elections commission in this 
city has decided to close down the registration post in 
Chipangara ward, one of the most densely populated areas in the 
capital city of Sofala Province. 
  The temporary closure was caused by the disappearance of two 
inscription bulletins on 4 June, which were recovered on 6 June, 
and the disappearance of 14 other bulletins, two of which were 
also recovered on 6 June. 
  Dr. Samuel Elias, chairman of the Beira Elections 
Commission, 
said after the papers went missing for the first time "we 
replaced the electoral team, thinking that it was their 
negligence. On 7 June, however, the new electoral team was 
physically and verbally assaulted by a group of five outlaws who 
said: `Take all this rubbish. These are Renamo's maneuvers, 
otherwise we will assault you.'" 
  Dr. Elias said, "this is happening because the police team 
assigned to operate in that post is not operating. I spoke to 
the head of the General Staff Police of the Republic of 
Mozambique, and we hope they will investigate the issue and 
inform us." 
  More than 10,000 people have already registered for the 
election in Beira, excluding the figures from the Nhangau 
administrative region, where the electoral registration process 
has not yet begun due to transportation problems. 
  Available reports say that following Beira is Nhamatada, 
which has registered more than 6,500 people in the nine posts it 
established in the area (three in Renamo areas, where nothing 
has been done yet), according to statements by District 
Elections Commission Chairman Ernesto Sinamana. 
  Speaking to NOTICIAS in Nhamatanda, Ernesto Sinamana said a 
huge number of citizens were flocking into the electoral 
registration posts, and it is expected that a large number of 
people will register over the next few days. 
  Regarding areas under the control of Afonso Dhlakama in 
Nhamatanda -- namely, Mucombezi, Nhamphoca, and Chirassicua, and 
others -- the process has not yet begun. It is expected that it 
will begin as soon as the necessary security conditions have 
been created. 
  Besides this security crisis, there is also the issue of 
transportation, since some of these areas are very far. 
Chirassicua, for instance, is 60 km from the capital of 
Nhamatanda District. 
  Meanwhile, the World Food Program [WFP] will grant food aid 
to more than 6,672 electoral officers all over the country, 
according to the WFP Director Philip Clarke.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Rafael Omar in Nampula] </F>
  [Text] The voter registration process in Nampula Province 
is experiencing problems. The Mozambique National Resistance 
[Renamo] Party has been complaining about an alleged presence of 
Tanzanian citizens in Matibane and Cabeceira posts in Mossuril 
District, as well as at Mozambique Isle. 
  A communique issued by the Renamo provincial branch in 
Nampula accuses the Mossuril district government of interfering 
with the voter registration process by illegally establishing 
mobile voter registration centers in the district when, 
according to it, there should only be fixed centers. 
  The Renamo political leadership in Nampula says the acting 
Mossuril district administrator has been diverting the attention 
of people by announcing the distribution of food in voter 
registration centers, allegedly to prevent them from registering 
as voters. 
  The Renamo communique sent to our news desk says government 
officials have been exacting taxes from civilians in voter 
registration centers. It cited as examples the areas of Gelo, 
Larde, and Gaone, in the districts of Angoche, Moma, and Rapale, 
respectively. In Rapale, these alleged tax collectors were 
deployed by the Rapale town council mayor. Renamo also says in 
its communique that two men belonging to the State Information 
and Security Service [SISE], carrying pistols and bayonets, were 
recently beaten up by civilians when they tried to kill two 
Renamo election monitors. Renamo also says that voter 
registration teams at Mapipine Ward, on the outskirts of Rapale 
city, have not been registering Renamo members. 
  The Renamo communique also says that at voter registration 
centers in Anchilo, also in the city of Nampula, voter 
registration photographers have been repeatedly and without 
controls photographing some people, particularly the head of the 
administrative post and the Mozambique Liberation Front 
[Frelimo] Party representative. Renamo cited photographer Jose 
Lopes Sumbana as having said that the pictures were just a 
remembrance. With regard to the uncontrolled taking of 
pictures, Renamo has warned that there should be no uncontrolled 
distribution of voter registration cards, since photographers 
say the uncontrolled taking of pictures has no particular 
purpose. 
  In the communique, Renamo says the presence of Frelimo Party 
secretaries and other government elements in voter registration 
posts are a clear violation of the electoral law. 
  In conclusion, Renamo calls on the Nampula Provincial 
Elections Commission to take necessary measures with regard to 
these issues. 
  Our reporting team contacted Aurelio Monteiro das Neves, 
chairman of the Nampula Provincial Elections Commission, who 
said there is no evidence of the presence of Tanzanians in voter 
registration centers, despite the presence of large number of 
foreigners in the province. Monteiro das Neves said Renamo 
should come up with at least one case where a Tanzanian citizen 
has been registered. 
  On other complaints in Mossuril, Moma, and Angoche, our 
source said it has sent a team to Mossuril District to 
investigate Renamo's complaints. 
  On the alleged presence of SISE men beaten up by civilians 
in 
Rapale, the chairman of the Nampula Provincial Elections 
Commission, said he received information that the two were just 
drunks and were not even armed. 
  On the alleged presence of ruling party members in voter 
registration posts, Aurelino Monteiro das Neves cited Article 50 
of the electoral law which says that any legal political party 
can cooperate with voter registration teams, although it is up 
to the latter to define, without discrimination, the need for 
and the sphere of that cooperation. The provincial elections 
commission chairman said he was not informed about the issue of 
photographs in Anchilo, but promised to bring up the case with 
election officials in that administrative post. 
  This is the second time here in Nampula that Renamo has been 
complaining about an alleged presence of Tanzanian citizens in 
the province, connected with the electoral process in Mozambique.

  [Text] The National Elections Commission [CNE] has decided 
to use computers in the electoral process. This was revealed by 
CNE chairman Dr. Brazao Mazula. He said the CNE's decision is 
irreversible and does not depend on the political parties' 
approval. Many opposition parties publicly opposed the use of 
computers in obtaining election results, alleging that they 
could be manipulated and that Mozambicans did not have enough 
experience in their use. In an interview with DOMINGO, Brazao 
Mazula said the political parties have been briefed on the CNE 
decision.

<F P=106> [Article by Tom Minney] </F>
  [Text] Namibians who served with Koevoet [crowbar -- 
counterinsurgency group] and the South West African Territorial 
Force [SWAFT] can return to Namibia from South Africa. At a 
recent meeting of Cabinet it was resolved they can come home 
"through normal channels". 
  The same welcome is not extended to any who are not 
Namibians 
and they "will not be allowed to return" according to a Cabinet 
announcement yesterday. 
  Last month, Namibia's representative in Pretoria Joshua 
Hoebeb said he had been approached by representatives of 550 
former Koevoet members, who wanted to come home with 1,100 
dependents. They were apparently fearful about their future in 
the new South Africa and the issue was urgent as they were due 
to be evicted from their settlement at a disused mine in 
northern Transvaal at the end of last month. 
  The Cabinet decision could also open the door to some 5,000 
former Bushmen soldiers who were taken by the SA Defence Force 
to a camp at Schmidsdrift, northwest of Kimberly. These are 
reportedly unhappy and keen to return. 
  Former Koevoet members in other parts of South Africa may 
also want to come back. Callers to radio chat shows have asked 
where the returnees would settle and how they would support 
themselves if their only skills are fighting, including against 
civilians. The Cabinet decision makes it clear that only those 
who can prove they are Namibians will be able to return. 
  Yesterday's announcement reads: "All ex-Koevoet/SWAFT 
members who are stranded there are advised to contact the 
Namibian Embassy in Pretoria for registration before 
repatriation." 
  Many other nationalities including Angolans and Zambians 
fought alongside the Namibians and South Africans in the SA-led 
armies. Most of them will have been issued with SWA [South-West 
Africa] identity documents or SA passports, but some may be 
genuine Namibians and find it difficult to produce their birth 
certificates and other documentation necessary to prove this. 
  Cabinet says "it is absolutely vital that all those involved 
give correct information to the registration officials." 
  Most of those now in South Africa travelled there around the 
time of independence, or were taken by the former SA Defence 
Force. They did not trust promises they would not be victimised 
under Namibia's national reconciliation policy. 
  Only now do they see that overall former soldiers of both 
Swapo [South-West African People's Organisation] and its former 
enemies are in the Namibia Defence Force and some have been 
helped with resettlement and other projects. 
  Meanwhile they are concerned about their future as aliens 
under an African National Congress, especially as Koevoet was 
sometimes accused of 'third force' activities in South Africa's 
townships in recent years.

  [Text] Zambia has mobilized 800 troops to help the United 
Nations in Rwanda, where more than 500,000 civilians have been 
slaughtered in a two-month civil war there. Defense Secretary 
Brigadier General Jack Mwaanga said in an interview with ZNBC 
[Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation] today that the 800 
soldiers are ready to leave for Rwanda any time. He said the 
contingent is on standby on the Copperbelt but cannot leave 
without special equipment which the Zambia Army has requested 
from other countries. Gen. Mwaanga said because of the 
difficult nature of the operation in Rwanda, the Zambian troops 
will need special equipment.

  [Excerpts] Harare June 10 SAPA -- The Zimbabwean Government 
has confiscated 17 commercial farms in terms of its 
controversial land acquisition act to redistribute land to black 
peasants. No arrangements for compensating the owners has been 
made, officials of the Commercial Farmers' Union (CFU) said on 
Friday [10 June]. They said government officials had since 
mid-May been posting or hand- delivering letters to farmers 
stating: "The president has acquired this land." The farms 
became the property of the state on March 16 and the owners were 
given three months to leave. "In other words, the owners have 
been farming on property not belonging to them for three 
months," CFU Director David Hasluck said. [passage omitted] 
  A few of the 17 farmers have had government valuers on their 
properties, but the government committee dealing with 
compensation had not yet convened, CFU officials said.

  [Text] Cape Town June 10 SAPA -- Zimbabwe's land 
redistribution programme was driven by humanitarian and moral 
considerations, and was not concerned with the political views 
of individual farmers, the country's president, Mr Robert 
Mugabe, said on Friday [10 June]. Speaking at a press 
conference in Cape Town, where he is attending the World 
Economic Forum Southern Africa summit, he said former Rhodesian 
Prime Minister Ian Smith could carry on farming as his land was 
not needed for resettlement purposes. 
  Mr Mugabe said there were 10.5 million Zimbabweans, most of 
them rural people who because of a land shortage had to lead a 
subsistence existence. Most arable land was in the hands of a 
mere 4,500 people. "Naturally we have to correct this position. 
What morality would we find more impelling than that which 
demands that the few, 4,500 people, must surrender it to the ten 
million people?" 
  Some land had to remain in the hands of the commmercial 
farming sector, and agro-industrial sugar, citrus, timber and 
wattle plantations would not be interfered with. "But ordinary 
2,000, 4,000 hectare pieces of land, some of these we say must 
come to the communal sector. Not all of it. We are not 
depriving all the farmers of their land. Mr Ian Smith's farm is 
not in question just now, because we regard it as not lying in a 
region where land must be acquired for resettlement purposes." 
Mr Smith was "free to continue farming on his land whatever his 
politics might have been in the past or still might be at 
present". 
  Mr Mugabe said his government did not care about the 
political thinking of an individual. "But we care about the 
human question, the humanitarian question, the moral question of 
doing justice. Justice will have to be done."

<F P=106> [Interview with President Robert Mugabe by Leslie Mashokwe </F>
in Cape Town; date not given; on the "Newsline" program -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Mashokwe] Mr. President, thanks for honoring us 
with this interview. I would like to ask you one very personal 
question. You studied in South Africa. You were at Fort Hare 
University, and you have been avoiding coming to this country 
for very a long time. With the demise of apartheid how do you 
feel being back in the Cape? 
  [Mugabe] It's a great feeling to be back to South Africa. I 
was back actually at the time of the inauguration, to attend the 
inauguration of President Mandela, and that was a great feeling, 
a great feeling indeed because I had last been here in 1952, 
only when I came back for graduation. I stayed in South Africa, 
I think for two years up to 19...[pauses] end of '51, in the 
Eastern Cape. A lot of things have happened since then, when I 
was at Fort Hare, and apartheid was just beginning to be 
implemented, and I remember the students who belonged to the 
African National Congress Youth League planning real action by 
way of demonstrations, sit-ins, and passive resistance, but 
after that the struggle took other dimensions, and there was 
armed struggle. 
  It was during that period -- we were in exile together with 
the ANC and the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], and together we 
planned the strategies to defeat colonialism in whatever form, 
whether it was in the form of apartheid or in form of UDI 
[Unilateral Declaration of Independence], as in southern 
Rhodesia then. And we got our independence in 1980, 14 years 
before South Africa got its freedom and democracy. 
  Of course, when we got our own freedom, we never regarded 
that as complete freedom of Africa, and we had always worked on 
a program, yes, for us to get our own freedom in what was 
Rhodesia, but also for others -- Namibia to get its own 
independence; South Africa to get its own freedom and democracy, 
and that was a long, long wait, a very long wait indeed. We all 
longed for a day when apartheid would go, when we could interact 
with South Africa, and we could visit South Africa and the South 
Africans could visit us. The day has now come, so it's a 
tremendous joy. 
  [Mashokwe] Were you at all surprised by the turn of events 
come February 1990, when President De Klerk then announced these 
changes? 
  [Mugabe] Yes, a mixture of both surprise and disbelief. 
Surprise, because we never expected that the leader of an 
Afrikaner Party, the National Party, which in fact had been the 
initiator of apartheid, could one day reverse it in that 
dramatic way. It was indeed dramatic, too dramatic for us to 
believe, but there it was. 
  When it was first announced, we thought it was just 
palliative, the statement was just palliative in that apartheid 
would not really go, but when one measure after another was 
taken to undo it and completely eradicate it from the statute 
book, then we started to believe. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. President, do you ever regret the stance that 
you took? You were known to be very vocal against apartheid. 
You didn't mince your words on this. When you look back, your 
country suffered a lot of economic ills. You were destabilized 
in the process. When you look back, do you have any regrets? 
  [Mugabe] We don't regret having taken the steps that we 
took. 
In fact, a country like Zimbabwe, who did not go the full length 
in opposing apartheid -- we wished we could have done more, but 
it was not possible because of the linkage between our economies 
-- the South African economy and Zimbabwe, a linkage that was 
consolidated by Ian Smith during UDI, and when Rhodesia was made 
to depend on South Africa. But politically, diplomatically we 
took quite a rigid stand, and we were not to have anything to do 
with those who were in charge of apartheid here and in 
government, therefore, because we held them responsible. We 
don't regret having taken that rigid stand at all, but we regret 
the loss of life that ensued, the sabotage that was carried out 
in Zimbabwe, destruction of ANC property and the loss of life 
that followed that destruction of property. That we regret. We 
still have those wounds. We still have the scars, the damaged 
buildings. They still are there, and in fact we still have 
prisoners we have arrested--people we have arrested for 
committing those acts of sabotage. But all that was really the 
amount of sacrifice we were called upon to make in order for us 
to have the day that now we have. In order for us to return to 
South Africa, we had to do all that. 
  [Mashokwe] The prisoners -- are they going to be released at 
any stage? What are the possibilities? 
  [Mugabe] Well, we are reviewing their cases. There are only 
five in our prison, and one of whom is a South African, 
(?called) (Zwayo), and the other four were South Africa's agents 
from white Rhodesia -- Rhodesians who worked with South Africa, 
but President De Klerk and now President Mandela have all 
appealed to me for possibly their release, but their death 
sentences had been commuted to life imprisonment, and therefore 
they are not going to die, but we are reviewing their cases. 
  I consulted with the Minister of Justice the other day, and 
we thought we should review their cases in the same way as we 
review the cases of our own, but now that here people have been 
pardoned, people who were guilty of what one might call 
political crimes, and had been pardoned, except a few, we might 
very well review their cases in a favorable way. 
  [Mashokwe] In South Africa we talk of this truth commission 
where South Africans are saying: Let's know what happened in the 
past. Let's pardon people, including right-wingers probably. 
  [Mugabe] Pardons, sure, must be granted. The past must go. 
Bygones must be bygones, and this is what I said in March 1980, 
when I appealed to both the black and white community to work 
together. They had to forget the past. They had now to 
recognize that whether yesterday they had fought as enemies or 
as allies, they could no longer actually do without each other, 
whichever way things go. We shall live side by side with each 
other, and therefore, there had to be a recognition of that 
common belonging, a common denominator that came about as a 
result of our independence. 
  The same with South Africa. There is that common denominator 
and your situation here is even much more complex than our own. 
We are only 10.5 million. You are 40-plus million, and 
therefore it's a big population you have, but apart from that a 
population that also subdivides itself into various races, 
various tribes, people living in various regions and a number of 
religious affiliations, and so it's a much more complex 
situation, and I admire the stance that President Mandela and of 
course the ANC have taken in demonstrating that this is now a 
new South Africa, which requires a new ideology, a new political 
outlook that binds everyone together and makes the people of 
South Africa have a common destiny, which means there is that 
greater sense of belonging to South Africa, greater sense of 
nationality than there ever was before. At least that's what is 
being cultivated and we admire that. 
  [Mashokwe] We talk now of the conference that you attended, 
on the threshold of the new era. Many critics say that this 
threshold never really reaches the ordinary people of southern 
Africa, of Africa. What is your comment on this? 
  [Mugabe] No, it does reach to the ordinary people of African 
grassroots, and we are always talking about the grassroots. 
True, when policies are first enunciated they don't 
immediately....[pauses] They don't go down to the masses until 
they have been explained, but this is the work that our 
subordinates must be doing in the regions and at various levels, 
to tell the people that we are now one, but of course it will 
take time for some of our people to forget and to forgive and 
forget, but the leadership, if it does continue to preach 
national reconciliation and national unity, national harmony, 
the message will get through. I assure you. 
  [Mashokwe] Unemployment in Zimbabwe is said to be about a 
fifth of your people there. We have the same kind of problems. 
Is there no danger, not just in Zimbabwe -- South Africa has 
the same problem -- is there no danger of unemployed people 
overturning political gains? 
  [Mugabe] No, I think the numbers are exaggerated. We have 
quite a lot of youngsters, yes, who are unemployed but our 
situation is quite different from yours. We are less urbanized 
than South Africa, less industrialized than South Africa. In 
industries -- we have in Harare, Bulawayo, Gweru, Mutare, yes -- 
but over 70 percent of the people, between 70 and 80 percent, 
are over [sentence as heard]. And the youngsters who are 
unemployed by and large are people with roots back in the rural 
areas. They come into urban areas to seek employment, but when 
they can't get that employment they go back to the rural areas. 
There is hardly a Zimbabwean who says Harare is his home. None. 
  We all have our roots where people can do agriculture, and 
this is a solution that really, that we find amongst us -- that 
is, if the going is not that good in town, people can always go 
back to the rural areas and eat, provided of course we have not 
been struck by droughts, and so there is that aspect. People can 
do agriculture, and our youth, we are now trying to mobilize so 
some of them, I hope a substantial number, can pursue 
agriculture you see, as a way of life. But this is not to say 
we don't have a sizable number of people unemployed. Yes, the 
reason they are unemployed is not because there had been any 
mismanagement of the economy, but rather that colonial -- the 
colonial legacy that we have has been that of underdevelopment 
in what was regarded as the African sector in the rural areas 
and also the development of skills was delayed or denied in some 
cases. 
  Therefore, even though the jobs are there but they are jobs 
for skilled men, and these cannot be found in every case. With 
jobs in industry, even in the public service, you see, we have 
jobs, but they require skilled people. In some cases the white 
employers go out of Zimbabwe to get skilled personnel, people 
with high skills whom they want to be managers or to be highly 
trained technicians operating in the -- I mean, to undertake 
operations in their industries. So that is one reason, but of 
course we are now engaged in trying to transform the system and 
opening it up to investment, encouraging existing investment to 
expand and, thereby, create more jobs. It will take us time, 
but we are doing that. 
  [Mashokwe] What role, Mr. President, do you see for South 
Africa in the Southern African Development Community? 
  [Mugabe] Oh, a tremendous role. South Africa will now come 
with its heavy muscle and join us. Heavy muscle, because it is 
a highly developed country. It has its own problems, of course, 
of underdevelopment in certain sectors, but you have highly 
developed industries and that gives South Africa quite a muscle 
with which it can interact with us as we relate to it, both 
multilaterally within the region, and also bilaterally. 
  We trade with South Africa. Zimbabwe is the largest trading 
partner South Africa has in Africa, and 20 percent of our 
imports come from this country, and so we are quite a market. 
Botswana gets about 80 percent of its imports from this country 
and so also is a good market, and now what we want to see is an 
economic order that binds us together in a cooperative way, and 
of course the benefits must be reciprocal. We must open up our 
borders, remove tariffs, or lower them for a start, and trade 
with each other as freely as we can. 
  [Mashokwe] Is there no fear of this big brother image which 
could probably bring about concern or suspicion? 
  [Mugabe] Oh, no, no, no. We are very happy. In fact we are 
encouraging countries whom whenever we speak and this subject 
arises, we always encourage countries to help South Africa at 
this stage. South Africa will need a lot more of aid by way of 
investment, even grants for a start. We had that kind of, you 
know, boost at the beginning of our independence, and at least 
to get us...[pauses] to get our economy to be reconstructed and 
rehabilitated, and South Africa needs that kind of assistance 
from the whole of the international community. 
  Yes, when one looks at Cape Town and Johannesburg, Durban, 
and the other big cities one is impressed by what happens there. 
But one must look also, even within those cities, at the 
depressed areas, you see, the townships, that has been 
neglected. One must look at the systems, social systems that 
operate and see whether these systems are equitable or 
inequitable. Look at the educational system. A lot needs to be 
done really to rehabilitate, to reconstruct and restructure it 
in such a way that it is the education that formally on the 
blacks [as heard]. 
  Education systems can be boosted, can be qualitatively 
transformed and brought to the level of the education that was 
obtained on the European side, and this is what we had to do in 
our own country -- remove the inequities of the past, all the 
inequalities. 
  That will require some funding, a lot, lot more funding and 
investment is required in order for the economy to continue to 
grow, and if South Africa prospers that way they will get the 
benefits as well, by way of the new technology which has come to 
South Africa. 
  There would be companies that will come to Zimbabwe, to 
Botswana. We already have lots of South African companies in our 
country and the technology that their parent companies acquire 
here will be technology that the subsidiaries elsewhere will 
require, but of course, within the system of our interaction, 
cooperation, the benefits by way of technology will be our 
benefits. The benefits by way of capital goods will also be our 
benefit. We will use machinery for our mines from South Africa. 
South Africa will sell them much more cheaply that Britain or 
Germany, for obvious reasons, are likely to sell those same 
goods to us. So, there is that benefit to be derived and we 
don't think that money that comes to South Africa is money that 
would have come to us, necessarily, no. 
  [Mashokwe] Fourteen years of Zimbabwe's independence. What 
lessons are there for South Africa -- for this new emerging 
democracy? 
  [Mugabe] Quite a number of lessons, and I don't think they 
are lessons necessarily for the government or for Mandela. They 
are lessons for the community. One, independence does not usher 
in an era of manna falling from heaven. Never will there be 
gifts the Almighty will shower down on the people of South 
Africa. The people of South Africa have got to sweat, to work 
hard. Now the environment is there. We must ask for the 
opportunity, you see, for them to work. The opportunity for 
them to have the necessary skills, the opportunity to be 
appointed, given they have those skills, to jobs that they were 
denied yesterday, and this is what the outlook must be on the 
part of the people -- patience. They will require a great 
amount of patience because delivery of benefits is a process, a 
function really, of the development of industries. 
  Then there is the second aspect which has to do with racial 
harmony. That has got to continue. If that fails then the 
country is ushered into an era of conflict and a country as 
large as South Africa, if it develops conflict you know what the 
consequences will be and there will then be a spill over into 
neighboring countries. One we would hope that doesn't happen. 
We are glad that the policy that has been adopted by President 
Mandela is one of racial harmony and one, of course, that seeks 
now to get rid of the conflict between Inkatha and the ANC, the 
conflict between the whites and the blacks, and if only the 
people will heed that lesson, then we will have a very peaceful 
and stable South Africa, but it will take time. 
  It has taken a long time for our own whites to adjust to the 
new situation. Yesterday they were the leaders, they were, 
well, the policy makers, and now that we are the policy makers 
some of them find it extremely difficult to adjust. 
Economically, they are still bosses in our country, the whites, 
and they have not, you know, as it were, reoriented their 
thinking. They have not fully adjusted. Some have adjusted but 
they are only a small number. 
  Ian Smith is still talking the same UD language ... UDI 
[Unilateral Declaration of Independence] language as in 1965. 
He hasn't adjusted, but we didn't have to adjust. We adopted 
the policies that we espoused, even during the liberation 
struggle. We said to ourselves we are not fighting the white 
man because he is white. We are fighting his policies. Once 
those policies have gone the white man becomes acceptable, but 
he will have to accept the new order, but you have people like 
Ian Smith. You have your own Ian Smiths here who will continue 
to fight for the old order, even though it's a futile struggle, 
but it will continue until [laughs] death takes them, and so 
really, we have got to be patient, and I would hope that my 
brother President Mandela will be patient with them and not get 
annoyed. We have been patient with Ian Smith. He still runs 
his farm. We have not confiscated it in any way. We ... 
sometimes you feel... [pauses] you feel the man is completely 
unrepentant. Why continue to treat him justly, but then sense 
and I think, magnanimity bids that, well, that the man is 
harmless anyway. Let him have his outpourings and they won't do 
anyone any harm. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. President, I'm running out of time. 
  [Mugabe] Yes? 
  [Mashokwe] The issue of the Frontline States, will it still 
be there as the OAU has been accused of not being able to 
address its own socioeconomic and political problems. Let's 
look at Rwanda for instance? 
  [Mugabe] Yes, the Frontline States no longer have a front 
line, and we do not regret that the front line has gone. I was 
joking with former President de Klerk yesterday, when he asked 
me whether South Africa was a member of the Frontline. I said 
yes, and he said where is the front line? I said if the FL 
still exists it's now the fishing line along the coast. And so 
that's why we wanted the Frontline to (?leave) and that's where 
we now are. So we can go fishing now, but we are looking at how 
we can transform the Frontline into an organ that will be a 
watchdog one, and come to the assistance of countries or a 
country that will have lost control because of some instability 
that has been triggered by lawless people. 
  And we have the example of Lesotho, what's happening in 
Lesotho, and really Lesotho requires friends now. Friends who 
believe in democracy. Not long ago they had elections there in 
order to transform the military experience there, which the 
people of Lesotho were forced to embrace for so long a time, 
into a new democratic order, and the elections were won by the 
BCP [Basotholand Congress Party]. But some people are opposed 
to that experience. And we feel that Lesotho is really to be 
allowed now some period of rest from military rule, and anyway, 
a period it deserves, because everybody in our region is going 
democratic. They will possibly be assisted. 
  And so the Frontline States, as a spearhead of the OAU, and 
also of course as an organization of our own region, can be 
transformed so it embraces not just the countries that fought 
for Zimbabwe, Namibia, and South Africa, but others also in our 
region. Possibly the role of SADC [Southern African Development 
Community], and has this political agenda, but not an agenda to 
interfere in the domestic affairs of a country, an agenda really 
to salvage a country, to save it from being torn apart by forces 
that are inimical to progress and democracy. And that's the 
role we hope those of our experts we asked to look at how the 
Frontline States can be transformed, and the new look Frontline 
States might be able to do. 
  But you made mention of the OAU and Rwanda. Well, the OAU is 
a much larger organization than the Frontline States, and of 
course the larger an organization is then the more complex and 
the more problems, and in some cases the more contradictions it 
embraces. And it's true that in Rwanda we have a situation that 
should have been controlled long ago, but this is not to say 
nothing was being done, President Mwinyi was working with our 
encouragement on a program to get the leaders to agree to 
proceed to elections, and in fact there is already an Arusha 
Agreement. 
  Unfortunately, the incident of an air crash reversed the 
process that was underway, but we hope we can once again, if we 
send troops, as some of us have committed ourselves to do, and 
bring the situation under control, and President Mwinyi can 
start the exercise from there. He left it off where the air 
crash and the events that followed disrupted it. So it's not 
that nothing was being done in Rwanda, it is only that when the 
event or the tragedy of the air craft that crashed happened, and 
the subsequent developments, the Hutu rising against the Tutsi, 
and we were not poised immediately to go into Rwanda and help 
solve the situation, that was unfortunate. 
  [Mashokwe] In conclusion Mr. Mugabe, what do you want to do 
when you stop being a politician? 
  [Mugabe] What do I want to do? I want to teach again. I 
want to go teaching. When I retire from politics, obviously, I 
want to do a little more reading, more writing especially, and 
bring you into another focus of our people, and some of my 
experiences in getting them to read and evaluate my experiences. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Mugabe, thanks for your time and for honoring 
us with this interview. 
  [Mugabe] Thank you.

  [Text] Up to now Burundi has been spared the murderous 
folly rocking Rwanda, but clashes have been reported, which 
leads to fears of contamination. Here is the interim president 
of Burundi, who is president until 1 July. Sylvestre 
Ntibantunganya spoke to Dominique de Courcelles: 
  [Begin recording] [Ntibantunganya] [passage indistinct] 
Burundi is necessarily affected by what happens in Rwanda, all 
the more so because (?we have always regarded Rwanda as our 
twin), and you know that with twins, when one suffers, the other 
(?follows) and [words indistinct], and we are catching the [word 
indistinct] of the Rwandan crisis today. So we are very much 
involved for two reasons: First, what is happening in Rwanda is 
a humanitarian crisis, and we can see its consequences, and we 
can also see its seriousness, given what we [word indistinct] a 
few days ago. 
  Second, what is happening in Rwanda, (?if we don't find a 
solution) could have negative repercussions, not only on 
Burundi, but also on the subregion. 
  So, what are we suggesting? We are suggesting that the two 
sides should sign and implement a cease-fire very quickly. 
Second we are suggesting that the two sides should return to 
the Arusha accords. There is no other [words indistinct]. 
Neither the Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF] nor the Rwandan 
government can govern Rwanda today without reference to the 
Arusha peace accords, which have to be modified today, given the 
rather unusual context. What struck me is that everyone is 
concerned that peace must return to Rwanda quickly. 
  [De Courcelles] [passage indistinct] 
  [Ntibantunganya] Yes, why not? After all, we do have easier 
contacts with (?that) country. The Burundian Government is very 
well acquainted with the different sides in the Rwandan crisis, 
and we think that we can have contacts at a deep level, based on 
diplomacy [passage indistinct]. 
  [De Courcelles] Specifically? 
  [Ntibantungyana] Specifically, (?I mean), we know the 
Rwandans, we know the people in the government and we know the 
ones in the RPF. (?What we are going to try) to do is to make 
deep level contacts with them. 
  [De Courcelles] Here? 
  [Ntibantungyana] Here, and in our subregion, and we have 
already started, in fact. 
  [De Courcelles] Telling them what? 
  [Ntibantungyana] Telling them: Stop. First because, if you 
continue to fight, it is a [word indistinct] (?of your people), 
and second, if you continue to fight, you are in danger of 
setting the whole of the subregion on fire, and you will bear 
the historical responsibility for it. [end recording]

  [Text] Government troops are far from stopping their 
barbaric acts. Today at around 0600, while representatives of 
the two armies were meeting at the UN Assistance Mission in 
Rwanda [UNAMIR] headquarters, government soldiers and Republican 
National Movement for Democracy and Development-Coalition for 
the Defense of the Republic militias abducted 32 people from 
their refuge at the Saint-Famille parish in Kigali. When this 
information reached the Rwandan Patriotic Front representatives, 
they left for the Saint-Famille parish in the company of UNAMIR 
officials to obtain details of the incident. This doubtlessly 
forced the abductors to release their victims. Evacuation 
operations, which were affected today by the barbaric acts of 
government soldiers, will resume tomorrow.

<F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>
  [Excerpts] Kigali, June 14 (AFP) -- Truce talks between 
Rwandan rebels and the government broke down Tuesday [14 June] 
after militiamen abducted and probably killed between 30 and 40 
people, many of them children, who had been sheltering in a 
Kigali church, the UN said. 
  UN officials in the capital said the group was abducted from 
the Sainte Famille parish and was feared dead. 
  "When they take them away they usually kill them," said 
General Henry Anyidoho, the deputy commander of the UN 
Assistance Mission (UNAMIR) here. The news came hours after 
reports of a fresh massacre of Tutsi civilians in a refugee camp 
in neighbouring Burundi. 
  The rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) broke off 
UN-sponsored peace talks with the government when news of the 
abductions filtered through. 
  Rebel negotiator Frank Mugambage warned the incident could 
jeopardize the future of the talks, adding that if government 
soldiers were not responsible then they were accomplices to the 
act. The RPF added it was seeking clarification from the UN 
mission here of unconfirmed reports that Tutsi civilians had 
been killed in the church. 
  Mugambage said his superiors would decide whether the RPF 
would attend the scheduled resumption of the talks Thursday. 
  Anyidoho said the abduction was reported by the priest in 
charge of the parish, which is in the government-controlled city 
centre and where some 3,000 people have taken refuge. Earlier in 
the day Hutu militiamen had prevented members of the tiny UN 
presence from evacuating civilians from Sainte Famille, said 
UNAMIR military spokesman Major Jean-Guy Plante. Meanwhile 
reliable sources in Burundi reported that more than 100 Tutsis 
were slaughtered overnight Monday in a refugee camp at Bugabira, 
northeastern Burundi, by a band of Rwandan Hutus who stole 
across the border between the two countries overnight. 
  Burundi has the same ethnic mix as Rwanda, which in April 
was 
plunged into an inter-ethnic bloodbath that has claimed up to 
500,000 lives. 
  At least 515,000 Rwandans have also fled the country, 
including 414,000 to Tanzania, according to census figures from 
the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). 
  The UNHCR said Tuesday in Geneva it was searching for new 
sites for refugee camps with Tanzanian authorities as current 
facilities near the Rwandan border were now overstretched. 
[passage omitted] 
  Questioned earlier about latest developments in Gitarama, 
the 
headquarters of the interim government south of Kigali which the 
RPF said it had captured Monday, General Marcel Gatsinzi, the 
head of the government talks delegation, simply confirmed that 
"there is fighting over there." Mugambage, however, said the 
town was "under total (RPF) control." 
  A UN military spokesman said he had been told by an RPF 
officer that the United Nations could visit Gitarama, which lies 
50 kilometres (30 miles) southwest of Kigali, probably Thursday. 
  Rebel radio claimed RPF rebels "now controlled many of 
Rwanda's prefectures, among them Byumba, Kibungo, Kigali, 
Gitarama and a big portion of Ruhengeri." 
  Meanwhile in Tunis, South African President Nelson Mandela 
pledged to send aid to Rwanda, but remained torn over UN calls 
for Pretoria to dispatch 50 armoured personnel carriers there. 
  The vehicles would pave the way for the long-delayed 
deployment of thousands of UN troop reinforcements there, UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali told AFP at the weekend.

  [Text] Tunis, June 14 (AFP) -- A Rwandan rebel official 
said here Tuesday [14 June] his forces and the government had 
agreed to an immediate ceasefire. 
  The official, Pasteur Bizimundu, said the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front would order its fighters to hold their fire Tuesday 
evening. 
  He said Rwanda's interim government had made the same 
pledge. 
Officials from both sides were in Tunis on the sidelines of an 
Organization of African Unity summit. 
  The ceasefire was reached in a meeting with the presidents 
of 
Zaire, Tanzania, Uganda and Burundi. 
  Ceasefire talks collapsed earlier in the day in the capital 
city Kigali after Hutu militiamen abducted and probably killed 
between 30 and 40 people, many of them children, who had been 
sheltering in a church, the United Nations said. 
  The rebel army is dominated by the minority Tutsis.

  [Excerpts] We have just learned from REUTER that fighting 
resumed in Kigali shortly before dawn this morning. [passage 
omitted] 
  Pasteur Bizimungu, one of the representatives of the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front [RPF], in Tunis [for the OAU summit], announced 
a cease-fire last night. He gave his reaction to Dominique de 
Courcelles: 
  [Begin recording] [Bizimungu] Yes, we allowed ourselves to 
be 
swayed by considering that if the massacres were to stop 
simultaneously with the fighting, we would not get anything. 
[sentence as heard]. 
  [De Courcelles] Nevertheless, is the mediation mission going 
to continue? 
  [Bizimungu] The mediation mission is going to continue, 
together with the mediator. So this will be a dialogue between 
the parties affected by the implementation of the Arusha accord. 
  [De Courcelles] Where? How? 
  [Bizimungu] This will happen in Arusha, I think [word 
indistinct] the mediator. The problem is solved. As for the 
mediator, he has obtained a cease-fire and what will come next, 
as was the case in the past, will be in the hands of the 
mediator. [end recording] 
  This mediator is Tanzanian President Ali Mwinyi. [passage 
omitted] 
  In France, Interior Minister Charles Pasqua is in favor of 
international intervention in Rwanda in view of the shame and 
scandal caused by the massacres, including those of children. 
This is a scandal, he said. The international community should 
be ashamed of itself. How can the leaders of the world still 
look at themselves in a mirror? This is what Charles Pasqua 
said. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Kigali, 15 Jun (AFP) -- Rwandan rebels and the 
Army fought with heavy artillery and small arms in the bloodied 
capital Kigali overnight and early Wednesday [15 June], despite 
the announcement of a two-month ceasefire. The ceasefire was 
announced Tuesday by a rebel official, Pasteur Bizimungu, who 
told the Organization of African Unity in Tunis that the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front (RPF) would order its fighters to hold their 
fire as of Tuesday evening. He told reporters that Rwanda's 
interim government had also pledged to observe a ceasefire. He 
said the truce was reached in a meeting with mediator Mobutu 
Sese Seko, the autocratic ruler of Zaire, and the presidents of 
Tanzania, Uganda and Burundi. 
  Meanwhile, UN-sponsored talks in Kigali which have been 
under 
way for two weeks have not yet led to a military settlement, 
while the rebels have been gaining ground. The head of the RPF 
delegation at the negotiations said Tuesday that the kidnap and 
presumed assassination by Hutu militiamen of 30 to 40 people, 
many of them children who had been sheltering in a church in 
Kigali, could scuttle these talks. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] is conducting 
elections of local leaders in Prefecture Byumba. The exercise 
started on 12 June 1994 in Mukarange and Muranda sectors, in 
Prefecture Byumba. The elections were conducted democratically 
and (?peacefully). After the elections, the RPF officials 
explained the RPF political approach to Rwanda's problems. The 
delay in the implementation of the Arusha peace agreements and 
why the RPF has been forced to resume fighting were also 
explained to the gathering. The officials of the RPF repeated 
the call on the people who have fled their homes to return and 
settle down, for the RPF has re-established security for all 
persons in the areas under their control. The RPF chairman, 
Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, has said that even the Republican 
National Movement for Democracy and Development militias, who 
will lay down their arms and stop committing atrocities, will be 
free to go home and settle down.

  [Excerpt] In Zaire, the deputies of the new transitional 
parliament have started voting in the election of the new prime 
minister. Yesterday, the two-thirds quorum failed to 
materialize. But the surprise came from Brussels this afternoon. 
Herve de Guelink reports: 
  [De Guelink] Zairean Parliament Speaker Mgr Monsengwo and 
his 
first deputy, the Social-Christian Joseph Ileo, are in Brussels. 
In a joint communique, both refused to endorse what is going on 
at the Zairean parliament at the moment. They in fact think the 
election of a prime minister by the parliament is contrary to 
the new Zairean constitution which came into force on 9 April. 
It took months of bargaining between the opposition and the 
allies of President Mobutu to agree on this document. The 
speaker of the parliament and his deputy, Mgr Monsengwo and 
Joseph Ileo, have therefore refused to endorse what they 
consider as illegal and they have appealed to President Mobutu 
to fully respect the new constitutional act of transition.

parliament named moderate opposition leader Joseph Kengo Wa 
Dondo Tuesday [14 June] as prime minister. 
  The vote was 332 in favor and 133 against.

longtime military ruler Mobutu Sese Seko dropped out and threw 
their support behind Wa Dondo.

  [Text] Zaire has a new prime minister. The High Council of 
the Republic-Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT] today appointed 
Mr. Kengo Wa Dondo as prime minister. Andre Mounyinga, an 
active member of the French branch of Mr. Tshisekedi's Union for 
Democracy and Social Progress [UDPS], has reacted to Mr. Kengo 
Wa Dondo's appointment. He does not seem at all happy about it. 
Mr. Mounyinga was interviewed by our correspondent in Paris, 
Mohamed Youssouffou Saliou. 
  [Begin recording] [Mounyinga] It is an unacceptable 
violation 
because it does not comply with the transitional text based on 
the agreements signed with them. The text does not indicate 
that a prime minister should be appointed by the HCR-PT. It is 
a violation we are not prepared to accept. We will fight it 
just as we fought the violations in the cases of Nguz 
Karl-I-Bond, Birindwa, and many others. 
  [Saliou] How do you see Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi's political 
future? 
  [Mounyinga] That is not the point. The question that needs 
to be asked is: How do we see the country's political future? 
I can only tell you that the whole population continues to 
rally behind the ideal of change which Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi 
and all the UDPS activists initiated a long time ago. You can 
be sure that this popular support will continue all the way.

  [Excerpt] President Isaias Afwerki today met and held talks 
with President Clinton's special envoy to Sudan. During their 
meeting, President Isaias and Melissa Wells, President Clinton's 
special envoy, extensively discussed the situation in our region 
-- and in particular the situation in Sudan. Mrs. Wells noted 
that the U.S. Government supported the Intergovernmental 
Authority on Drought and Development [IGADD] member countries' 
efforts to bring lasting peace to the Horn of Africa, and in 
particular to resolve the Sudanese problem peacefully. She also 
briefed President Issaias on the U.S. Government's readiness to 
cooperate with IGADD member countries in bringing lasting peace 
to the region. President Issaias noted that the appointment of 
a special envoy to Sudan by the U.S. Government clearly showed 
their desire to solve the problem. [passage omitted]

OPDO candidates, denying all the 32 independent candidates who

independent and 13 organization-based candidates took part, all 
13 seats were taken by the Amhara Nationality Democratic

the other seat. In this constituency, eight candidates were 
sponsored by organizations and there were 24 independent

  [Excerpt] Kampala, 14 June (PANA) -- More than 2,000 
Sudanese refugees are now camped in Bibia in northern Uganda 
after fleeing intensified fighting between government forces and 
the rebel Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) in 
neighboring Sudan, the state-owned NEW VISION newspaper reported 
today. 
  It said the town of Nimule in southern Sudan was last week 
tense as residents feared an attack from government troops. 
This followed the dropping of leaflets by government troops 
advising the civilian population to quickly vacate the town as 
bombing was imminent. Thousands of civilians were seen walking, 
carrying personal belongings away from Nimule. Trucks of the 
United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) were by 
Tuesday [14 June] still ferrying fleeing Sudanese between Nimule 
and Bibia. The refugees were later being transferred to refugee 
camps in Moyo District, north-western Uganda. 
  As the war for control of Nimule intensified, there is 
apparently no hope of SPLA troops resisting the seemingly well 
organized government troops, the NEW VISION said. The newspaper 
said refugees were moving in tribal groups. The Dinka, who 
consider themselves a higher class, refuse to share camps with 
other tribes. Dinkas are camped at Lobone camp in southern 
Sudan bordering the Ugandan District of Kitgum. Most 
non-government organizations that had operated in the rebel-held 
southern Sudan had also fled the area for northern Uganda.

  [Text] Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals says South Africa 
must reduce its budget deficit as a matter of urgency if it 
wants to avoid a crippling government debt level. Speaking in 
Switzerland, Dr. Stals said the new government would find it 
difficult to reduce expenditure while seeking to deal with 
poverty and helping low-income groups. Excessive government 
debt would also exert upward pressure on long-term interest 
rates. Dr. Stals disclosed, however, that the outflow of 
short-term capital in the run-up to the elections has reversed 
itself. Since the elections the Reserve Bank had become a net 
buyer of American dollars.

<F P=106> [By David Greybe] </F>
  [Text] Cape Town -- The new provinces were expected to get 
some of their powers only at the end of next week, after central 
government delayed last Friday's planned implementation, the 
Office of the Public Service Commission said yesterday. But 
they would have to wait even longer before they got some of the 
more substantial powers listed in the interim constitution, 
commission deputy director-general Johan Grabe said. 
  "The first batch of provincial powers will comprise all the 
powers and functions contained in the ordinances and statutes of 
the four old provinces, plus those of the former TBVC [Transkei, 
Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states and self-governing 
territories," he said. 
  Specific powers listed in the constitution, but excluded at 
this stage, included housing, agriculture, trade and industry, 
financial borrowing, land affairs, education, and provincial 
service commissions. 
  Grabe said the enormous workload encountered in preparing 
the 
first batch of legislation, particularly the need to get the 
technical details correct, had been the main reason for the 
delay. Government departments, assisted by state law advisers, 
had begun work on the second batch. 
  Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi warned at the 
weekend that the success of the government of national unity 
could be in jeopardy if the constitutional deadlock with the 
Inkatha Freedom Party over provincial powers, particularly in 
KwaZulu/Natal, was not resolved soon. 
  He said Inkatha's qualified support for the reconstruction 
and development programme [RDP] was contingent on the autonomous 
implementation by provinces of RDP chapters in their 
jurisdiction. 
  After meeting provincial leaders last week, Deputy 
Provincial 
Affairs Minister Valli Moosa said a proclamation returning about 
half the provincial powers to the regions would be published in 
last Friday's GOVERNMENT GAZETTE. He said provincial powers 
would be phased in, but there would be provincial differences as 
each province had its own peculiarities. 
  Grabe said the desire to proceed in an "orderly manner" had 
also slowed down proceedings. "It has been a hell of a 
process." However, the first batch of "quite substantial" 
legislation would be ready for signing by President Nelson 
Mandela on his return from the OAU summit in Tunis. It would 
then take a few days to prepare for publication in the GAZETTE. 
  Grabe said a "realistic" publication date was Friday next 
week. If government wanted it published earlier, a special 
GAZETTE would have to be prepared. 
  Nearly two weeks ago provincial powers were temporarily 
transferred to central government, which said they would be 
passed back once provinces demonstrated their ability to 
administer them.

  [Text] Durban June 13 SAPA -- A tripartite alliance in the 
KwaZulu/Natal Midlands at the weekend called on African National 
Congress MPLs [member provincial legislature] and MECs [member 
executive council] to boycott any meetings of the provincial 
legislature at Ulundi. Dr Blade Nzimande, spokesman for the 
ANC/Congress of South African Trade Unions/South African 
Communist Party alliance, on Monday [13 June] said a weekend 
congress had voted for Pietermaritzburg as the provincial 
capital. 
  The province's Executive Council holds its weekly meeting at 
Ulundi on Tuesday. If the three ANC MECs attend it will be their 
first official visit to the former homeland capital and 
traditional seat of the rival Inkatha Freedom Party. 
  Dr Nzimande said the congress had called for a referendum on 
the siting of the capital, a suggestion once made by IFP 
President and Minister of Home Affairs Mr Mangosuthu Buthelezi. 
  Both the IFP's rivals in the provincial legislature, the ANC 
and the National Party, favour Pietermaritzburg for the capital. 
  The ANC says political intolerance is rife in Ulundi. The 
organisation cites the murders there of three ANC election 
campaigners in April. 
  Premier Dr Frank Mdlalose's office could not be reached for 
comment. 
  The Executive Council has still to make proposals to the 
legislature on the siting of the capital.

  [Text] The National Party [NP] has intervened in the 
dispute between the ANC and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] in 
KwaZulu/Natal, calling on the IFP to show commitment to 
democratic decision-making. The ANC and IFP have clashed on the 
question of a capital for the province, with the IFP favoring 
Ulundi, while the ANC and the NP favor Pietermaritzburg. The 
ANC has gone so far as to urge members of the Executive Council 
to boycott meetings held in Ulundi. 
  The leader of the NP in the province, Mr. Danie Schutte, has 
accused the IFP of adopting a one-sided attitude towards 
decision-making and said the IFP and the ANC have not yet proved 
that they can work together in a provincial government of 
national unity. Mr. Schutte also attacked the call by IFP 
Transvaal leader Themba Khoza for the immediate lifting of the 
state of emergency in KwaZulu/Natal and described it as 
arrogant. Citing the deaths of 45 people last week and more 
killings at the weekend, he said a decision to lift the state of 
emergency could not be taken lightly.

  [Text] The choice of a capital for KwaZulu/Natal has 
resulted in a new political dispute. The three ANC members in 
the executive committee of KwaZulu/Natal today agreed to boycott 
meetings of the provincial legislature in Ulundi. 
  This follows the Inkatha Freedom Party's choice of Ulundi as 
capital. The ANC alliance and the National Party prefer 
Pietermaritzburg. The province's premier, Mr. Frank Mdlalose, 
said the problem will be discussed at a session of the 
provincial parliament later this month in Ulundi. 
  [Begin Mdlalose recording, in English] It will not be the 
determination of a capital itself on those days, but it will be 
the way to go about it. You will realize that there could be a 
number of things, for example, it could be by referendum which 
would have, of course, its own implications. It could also be 
by way of a commission that would look into the whole issue and 
report back either to the cabinet or to the parliament of 
KwaZulu/Natal. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Comment and Opinion" page: "Put the past to </F>
rest"; article published in English] 
  [Text] The posturings of the ANC Government, and statements 
by the new Minister of Justice, Mr Dullah Omar are foolish and 
will infect the spirit of goodwill and reconciliation which have 
up until now been so evident. 
  This posturing takes the form both of a proposed Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission, and the freezing of amnesty granted 
to certain categories of criminals by former President F.W. de 
Klerk. 
<H5>  NO SYMPATHY </H5>
  This newspaper has little sympathy for those who committed 
heinous crimes with political motive. Murder is murder, and it 
does not take on a more acceptable hue because it is political. 
  However if amnesty is to be provided this must be done on an 
even-handed basis. To do otherwise creates the wholly justified 
perception that the Government is prepared only to protect those 
murderers and criminals with which it was once associated, and 
with which it continues to be associated. 
  The amnesties were stopped, reportedly, because those 
indemnified need to confess all their sins first. However, let 
it be borne in mind that many indemnified ANC leaders have not 
yet confessed their sins, and are unlikely to ever do so. 
<H5>  SELF RIGHTEOUS </H5>
  The ANC labours under the mistaken impression that its 
murderers are morally superior to those associated with the 
former Government. 
  It is this kind of bizarre thinking which prompts the ANC, 
smugly convinced of its self-righteousness, to proclaim the need 
for a "Truth and Reconciliation Commission." 
<H5>  DANGEROUS </H5>
  This kind of delusion is dangerous for a party, which has 
amongst its ministers a kidnapper, an alleged diamond smuggler, 
persons implicated in bomb blasts, and a foreign minister, 
Alfred Nzo, who is on public record as supporting the burning to 
death of other human beings. 
  The term "Truth and Reconciliation Commission" is itself 
something of an Orwellian invention, the kind of spurious 
semantic facade which so appeals to those on the left. For the 
same reason the new Government has decided to call the Ministry 
of Police, as it is called in most other countries, the Ministry 
of Safety and Security. For its part, the proposed Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission is a grand name for what is no more 
than a political inquisition. 
<H5>  SPURIOUS </H5>
  We all know that this has little to do with reconciliation. 
And though it would be interesting to know which ANC leaders 
ordered Robert McBride's grisly murders, the commission is 
unlikely to be this even-handed in its investigations. 
  The Justice Minister has already stated there should be no 
moral comparison between ANC murder and brutality, and that of 
the former government. 
  According to this logic Robert McBride's mutilation and 
murder of innocents is not evil because it was done for a good 
cause. Acts are not inherently evil because evil is primarily 
identifiable with the choice of one's cause. 
<H5>  MORAL RELATIVISM </H5>
  This moral relativism is itself evil, and leads to evil. It 
is this logic which says that the Nazi Holocaust was despicable, 
whilst the Stalinist Holocaust was merely unfortunate. Indeed 
the latter event should be swept under the carpet and studiously 
ignored because the Soviet concentration camps were created in 
the name of humanity. 
<H5>  TWO COMMISSIONS? </H5>
  If we are to have inquisitions let us put both the NP 
[National Party] and the ANC in the dock. Better that two such 
commissions are established both with similar resources and with 
a similar will to uncover evil, one for each organisation. Then 
later we can compare the tally sheets and decide which side was 
worse, relatively speaking. 
  Instead we are likely to end up with just another propaganda 
forum, which even if it displays half the selectivity of the 
Goldstone Commission, will generate more heat than light about 
the nature of political evil in South Africa. 
  So, in the best Orwellian tradition we are likely to have a 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission which offsets reconciliation. 
  The Truth Commission says Dullah Omar, will complete its 
work 
in eighteen months to two years. 
  Let us hope it does so more quickly. Because then the 
central state can get on, more seriously than before, with its 
stated goal of reconciliation and nation-building.

<F P=106> [From the "Comment and Opinion" page: "Lest we forget"; </F>
article published in English] 
  [Text] If the African National Congress is to establish a 
so-called Truth Commission, then we hope it will turn its 
attention to matters which have thus far confounded the 
Goldstone Commission. 
  Both the President and the Minister of Justice have said 
that 
people who come forward to confess their crimes will be granted 
indemnity. 
  We hope that amongst the people who come forward to confess 
will be those responsible for the serial murder of more than 350 
leaders of the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and thousands of its 
supporters. 
  The President of the ANC and current State President, Mr 
Nelson Mandela, went before the United Nations and labelled the 
IFP a surrogate of the former South African Government. 
  If one were to believe him, then one must logically assume 
that the former government would not have murdered IFP leaders. 
  Now, logic compels one to conclude that the IFP cannot be 
guilty of murdering its own leaders. So, if the former 
government was not murdering the IFP, must one conclude that it 
was the ANC? 
  Mr Justice Richard Goldstone, a strong supporter of the 
proposed Truth Commission, was seemingly unable to cast any 
light on the matter. Under the circumstances, what hope is 
there that the identity of the murderers will be brought into 
the light? Are they likely to confess to the truth commission? 
One would have to believe in miracles to expect that. 
  We repeat -- the murder of the IFP leaders and its 
supporters 
is a crime of monumental proportions against the people of this 
land. If those punting a truth commission want to be taken 
seriously, they should tell the loved ones of those that have 
been murdered how they intend going about solving these murders. 
  After all one of the two -- the former government and the 
current one -- must either know something about these dastardly 
crimes or at least know how to go about solving them.

  [Excerpts] South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo has 
emphasized that the conditions in his country are stable in 
comparison with earlier conditions. He attributed this to the 
recent introduction of political reforms, which have contributed 
to easing the violence and calming the tension that prevailed in 
the country during the apartheid era. 
  In an interview with AL-SAFIR on the sidelines of the 
Nonaligned Conference last week, Nzo said that the political 
situation in his country will improve once the five-year 
transitional period is over. Then political and economic 
institutions will be reformed and human rights will be 
respected, he added. He pointed out that the South Africans are 
thirsty for freedom and democracy and that everyone is serious 
about proceeding toward democracy and eliminating apartheid. 
[passage omitted] 
  Nzo stressed his country's support for Arab rights at 
international and regional forums. He added: "We support steps 
to restore all the Arab rights and occupied territories and back 
the Arabs' endeavors in this area, particularly the 
Palestinians, because the policy of occupation has been rejected 
by us. Recently we have curtailed South Africa's relations with 
Israel and have suspended all previous cooperation activities 
with that country in the political, economic, and military 
areas. This is in line with the instructions and clear policy 
adopted by the current government of President Nelson Mandela, 
who has voiced support for the Palestinian people and those 
whose lands are usurped and who live under oppression and 
dictatorship and strive to regain their full rights." 
  The South African minister disclosed that his country has 
expelled dozens of Israeli experts and military personnel who 
were working in Johannesburg and some other districts. They 
were replaced by blacks, who had been banned from working in 
those areas in the past, he added. He pointed out that when the 
Israeli Government tried to sneak back into the country through 
back doors, these doors were slammed shut in its face and it was 
told that bilateral relations had to follow a certain course and 
that they must not come at the expense of relations with 
neighboring African or Arab states. He added: Thus, now there 
is no military or nuclear cooperation with Israel, as in the 
past. South Africa has become a state committed to 
international legality and policies or relations that do not 
enjoy international acceptance cannot be pursued. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Commentary" column] </F>
  [Text] During the penultimate congress of the old National 
Party under the premiership of Dr. Malan there were extensive 
discussions about the "native problem" which the National Party 
had to resolve. The "natives" political attitude, preferences 
and problems were tabled. 
  Until a young delegate from the western Transvaal, who was 
attending his first NP congress, stood up and questioned whether 
we were not looking for the solution to the "problem" in the 
wrong corner. The big "problem" and the source of the problems 
was not the "natives" themselves, but the English -- the 
missionaries, the professors and the politicians. Solve the 
English "problem," get rid of the English and Anglicized 
missionaries, professors and politicians, and the "native" 
problem would solve itself. 
  Dr. Malan did not respond to the question but Adv. Strydom, 
through the delegate's MP, let him know that he agreed with him, 
even though he could not talk about it at the congress. The 
"natives'" politics were the hand of Esau, but the voice was 
that of the English Jacob. 
  Mr. Jaap Marais echoed Adv. Strydom's sentiment at the HNP 
[Reformed National Party] congress last week and at a conference 
the night before. The whole black politics, the black majority 
in the government, the human rights argument, the entire 
integration and handover politics are a British-American weapon 
against Afrikaner nationalism which stands in the way of the 
British- American political plan in Africa. 
  This political trend has continued since the days before 
Milner -- who did not want the franchise, but instead the 
Afrikaner's country -- right up to the ANC-dominated new South 
African Government, a product of relentless interference by 
Britain and the United States. It has been coming since Mr. 
F.W. de Klerk's officiousness to serve British interests, until 
current attempts to cripple the Afrikaner's politics and to 
restore British domination by means of cunning methods so as to 
bring about and maintain a British-American "peace" under a 
communist umbrella. 
  Our priority right now should be to frustrate 
British-American meddling in white politics and to bind the 
Afrikaners together against this government. We will deal with 
the blacks ourselves.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Prison `Mayhem' -- The Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 
14 
June in a page-16 editorial criticizes the South African 
Prisoners Organization for Human Rights, SAPOHR, for its role in 
the recent prison riots. It is "worrying" that SAPOHR "launches 
campaigns and then washes its hands of the consequences. Mass 
action may have been justified during the apartheid years, but 
SAPOHR's mobilisation tactics now border on the irresponsible. 
It should rather focus on prison conditions alone. Calling for 
a general improvement there is a legitimate pursuit; promoting 
lawlessness and intimidation is not." Turning to the 
government, the editorial then states that "both the 
Transitional Executive Council, before the election, and now the 
Government have vacillated in dealing with the causes of this 
year's prison protests. Instead of establishing a moral, 
ethical and legal basis for dealing with the franchise and 
amnesty issues, the authorities appear to have made concessions 
because of a lack of resolve. This kind of expediency sets a 
dangerous precedent. It is something the country may yet come 
to rue." 
<H8>  CITY PRESS </H8>
  Government Urged To Resist SAPOHR -- The Johannesburg CITY 
PRESS in English on 12 June in a page-14 editorial states that 
SAPOHR's Golden Miles Bhudu "must be told that he is playing 
dangerous games by inciting prisoners to embark on so-called 
rolling mass action to force the new government to grant amnesty 
to the prisoners. The government must stand firm against any 
attempts by SAPOHR to blackmail it. Any wholesale release of 
prisoners would seriously undermine respect for the law." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  RSA Aid to Rest of Africa -- "Perceptions in the rest of the 
continent, rightly or wrongly, are that South Africa is a honey 
pot," begins the Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 14 June in a 
page-6 editorial. "It is therefore inevitable, now that the 
country has `opened up,' that people from more depressed 
circumstances elsewhere will head for our borders." The SOWETAN 
states that the government's approach to "economic refugees" 
should be "threefold": first, treat refugees with "compassion 
and humanity," second, get involved in resolving political 
disputes "without becoming the `policeman' of Africa," and 
third, "guard against using its economic strength to exploit 
countries on the sub-continent." "Balanced economic growth 
ensuring job opportunities and development for all in the region 
is the most potent counter to the refugee problem." 
<H8>  THE CITIZEN </H8>
  Government's "Race Classification" Criticized -- "Strange, 
isn't it? The previous Nationalist government got rid of race 
classification three years ago. The new ANC-dominated 
government intends to bring it back," states the Johannesburg 
THE CITIZEN in English on 13 June in a page-6 editorial. The 
government "is going to introduce race monitors -- defined as 
`affirmative action monitoring mechanisms' -- to ensure that 
affirmative action is carried out in the government and private 
sectors. In some cases, according to the ANC, firms may be 
required to keep records of the race of employees and even of 
consumers." "Since race is no longer required to be stated in 
identity books, one wonders how race will be established under 
the ANC rules." Banks, businesses, and the civil service will 
be brought under analysis. The editorial supports its 
contention by quoting passages from the Reconstruction and 
Development Program. "We hope the ANC will realise that any 
form of race monitoring or classification is a throwback to a 
system that could not be tolerated when it was enforced 
previously -- and cannot be tolerated if it is imposed now. 
Not, unless the ANC wants to destroy its nonracist image and 
plunge the country into a new racial morass."

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  BEELD </H8>
  Prison Riots -- The government must act firmly says a page-8 
editorial in Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 13 June in its 
reaction to the prison strikes. "The bloody uprising and 
hostage drama at the Modderbee Prison and the millions of rands' 
worth of damage caused by protesting inmates in at least eight 
prisons are indications of a very disturbing development." The 
spate of violence and vandalism in the latest so-called 
"peaceful" protest is "unacceptable and inexcusable under any 
circumstances. Such behavior should not be tolerated." 
According to the editorial, the organization claiming to 
represent the prisoners, the South African Prisoners 
Organization for Human Rights, "has this time either overplayed 
its hand, or it has no control over its members....The decision 
by the government to give all prisoners a six months' remission 
is a mistake." It is high time the government sent out a loud 
and clear message: "The season of violence and lawlessness is 
gone for good." 
  Help for Africa -- A second editorial on the same page of 
the 
paper notes: "It is becoming all the clearer that African 
countries, especially those south of the Sahara, are waiting 
with optimism that South Africa will rescue them from the 
economic quagmire in which they find themselves due to 
corruption and bad management....Western countries have written 
them off. The former Communist Bloc has forgotten about them 
and are themselves in economic misery. South Africa must now 
jump to their rescue." According to the paper, President Mandela 
is handling this sensitive issue "well." At the recent World 
Economic Congress in Cape Town he assured African countries that 
South Africa did not intend to dominate them, but as a 
copartner, wanted to play a role in trying to reconstruct and 
develop Africa south of the Sahara. The editorial goes on to 
suggest: "If South Africa could help its neighbors in creating 
jobs for themselves, for instance, its own problem with illegal 
immigrants could be minimized." There must be caution against 
too big expectations. "The government's task of upliftment lies 
here first of all, and only thereafter can it direct its efforts 
elsewhere in Africa. There is little money." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Government Action -- An editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in 
English on 15 June on page 10 warns that "people are starting to 
loose patience" with the slow pace of government action on its 
promises. "Most people are reasonable and do not expect the 
Reconstruction and Development Programme to take off at once. A 
start, however small, has to be made. The important thing is to 
place some projects physically on the line. For instance, even 
if one area is prepared for housing, the streets tarred and the 
infrastructure put in place, people will be mollified. The 
trick is to show physically that the intention to make the plans 
work is there."

  [Text] Muslim worshippers at the Abobo Banco II Mosque were 
honored with the visit of an emissary from the head of state 
following the incidents that occurred there on 10 June between 
the security forces and worshippers during an identification 
check. On the instructions of the president of the Republic, 
Security Minister Gaston Ouassenan Kone visited the scene 
yesterday to reassure the Muslims on behalf of the government. 
Here is the message he had for them. 
  [Begin Kone recording] President Henri Konan Bedie, who was 
informed about certain incidents that occurred here, has asked 
me to bring you his greetings and to express his distress over 
the incident. I am therefore here to convey his message and to 
assure you that the incident will not be repeated. It will not 
be repeated because in this country, which was built by 
President Houphouet- Boigny who sought to make it a country of 
peace and hospitality, it is not normal for such incidents to 
occur. 
  We know that certain measures have been taken concerning 
resident permits. As you know, the present head of state has 
taken over a mandate which he has to complete so, obviously, not 
everything can be changed during this period. We are examining 
the issue of resident permits, but action will be taken on it in 
future. What I can tell you now is that President Bedie has 
decided that henceforth resident permits will no longer be 
checked on Fridays. I have also asked the Abobo mayor to 
provide me with all the information he was able to gather here 
so that when I return to my office I can take the necessary 
disciplinary measures. As you know, we do not trifle with such 
matters when the country's interest is at stake. [end recording]

<F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan with </F>
domestic correspondents in Abidjan; monitored in progress -- 
live] 
  [Excerpts] ...before we start analyzing the first details 
of the results of this measure in the current economic context, 
and last, touch on some economic prospects. First, concerning 
the backup measures, the main objective of this CFA franc 
adjustment was the restoration of our economies' 
competitiveness, which should significantly increase exports and 
investments. However, in order to ensure the success of the CFA 
adjustment and achieve the objectives that we sought, it was 
absolutely necessary to adopt a set of backup measures, which 
government endeavored to implement after the decision was 
announced. The government's first objective was to check 
inflation and uncontrolled price increases. Thus, the machinery 
to control price increases following the devaluation was 
immediately set up. On 13 January, a decree was signed by the 
president of the Republic aimed at freezing, for a maximum 
period of three months, the prices of 34 items which were 
considered essential. [passage omitted] 
  What is the bottom line on the devaluation at the end of 
these first five months? On the whole, the balance sheet could 
be said to be positive. First, the results obtained in the area 
of inflation are very encouraging, since the rate for the first 
four months of this year stood at about 21 percent. Even 
better, the monthly consumer price index trend since the 
devaluation shows a downturn in the inflation rate. For 
example: The consumer price index for an African household 
headed by a workman registered a monthly increase of 8 percent 
in January -- the month of the devaluation -- 6 percent in 
February, 5 percent in March, and down to 1 percent in April. 
Similarly, the consumer price index for an African household 
headed by a professional also showed a monthly increase -- of 9 
percent -- in January, before falling gradually to 1.5 percent 
in April. The index for a European household, which, as 
everybody knows, involves more imported goods, registered a 
17-percent upturn in January -- before stabilizing at about 7 
percent in February and March, and then falling to 2 percent 
between March and April. 
  The obvious result is that we are winning the battle with 
inflation, and this is thanks to the support of the entire 
private sector and all the different social categories of the 
population. Already we can see that the prices of certain 
specific items have stabilized, or even dropped. This 
significant progress made in the area of prices shows that the 
devaluation is being well managed, and that, for the moment, it 
is a success. It is a success for everyone, Ivorians and 
resident businessmen in Cote d'Ivoire, who have shown a great 
sense of responsibility on this issue. I would therefore, on 
behalf of the head of state and the government, like to thank 
them for the efforts and sacrifices they made in managing the 
devaluation. 
  The second area of satisfaction concerns the trend in public 
finance. Looking at the trend in revenue and expenditure, we 
can say that the primary balance -- the balance between revenues 
and primary expenditures -- of the state's financial operations 
has improved significantly, and stands at a very positive level 
of about 100 billion, as against the 57 billion projected under 
the program. This trend is expected to continue in the coming 
months and years, and should enable a gradual reduction in the 
payment of mostly domestic arrears, which is a vital factor for 
economic revival. 
  The third area of satisfaction is the resumption of economic 
activities. Of course, it is early yet to talk of very 
appreciable growth. However, the blossoming of activities that 
we have observed indeed confirm that there is a reversal of 
trends. The reasons for this phenomenon are many: The 
restoration of the Ivorian economy's ability to compete, the 
gradual return of the private sector's confidence in the 
post-devaluation running of affairs, political stability, and 
the social peace prevailing in Cote d'Ivoire, despite the 
considerable shock caused by the devaluation. 
  All these factors explain the changes currently taking place 
within our economy. Thus, for the first quarter of this year, 
the index for industrial production increased by 5 percent; for 
agro-industry, it rose by 15 percent; and for the electricity 
and water sector, by 8 percent during the same period. This 
favorable development is even more evident in the area of the 
country's external trade. The restoration of competitiveness 
led to a 13- percent increase in the volume of exports during 
the first quarter of this year resulting mainly from a 
substantial increase in the export of food crops to other 
countries, rough and processed timber, and especially industrial 
goods, whose volume increased by about 34 percent for the same 
period. This really shows that the devaluation has opened up 
new development prospects for our goods in external markets. 
  Concerning imports, the trend is also encouraging. The 
volume of food imports decreased by about 3 percent during the 
first quarter of this year, which also shows a gradual change in 
eating habits of Ivorians, who now tend to consume more locally 
produced goods, thus reducing the need to import foreign goods. 
  As for the monetary situation in our country, the process 
is going smoothly and positively and it is marked by a money 
supply worth 112.04 billion CFA francs which is an increase 
amounting to 149 billion CFA in terms of external assets. For 
the money supply, this evolution is characterized essentially by 
an increase in bank deposits worth 106.03 billion due mainly to 
the progress made in increased assets in the private sector 
amounting to 14 billion CFA francs. This, in conjunction with 
the return of private capitals, added to the automatic effect of 
the devaluation on the upturns of export goods. As for external 
assets, the 149 billion-increase is the result of the loans by 
the Central Bank of West African States of 49.9 billion CFA 
francs and the reorganization of the banks' external statements 
of 99.1 billion CFA francs. The Ivorian banks have now become 
creditors vis-a-vis overseas banks. 
  As for internal debts, they are now reduced to 75.5 billion 
CFA francs, compared with December 1993. This reduction is 
achieved through joint government's aid that has also been 
reduced to 21.8 billion, and economic loans that have been 
reduced to 57.3 billion CFA francs. [passage omitted] 
  The devaluation should enable us to start afresh. The first 
indicators I briefly presented showed that we are on the right 
path. Indeed, much remains to be done. We should therefore 
make more efforts to achieve economic growth and significantly 
reduce unemployment, particularly within the ranks of the youth. 
The palliative measures aimed at rural areas should continue. 
The productive sector should be more dynamic in order to 
integrate this new environment by seeking new markets by 
increased production. Efforts are to be still made at the level 
of interest rates which should be reduced. The banking system 
should play a leading role in the financing of investments 
necessary for economic revamping. [passage omitted] 
  In conclusion, all this is aimed at achieving an increase in 
the kind of economic growth we enjoyed in the past and at making 
Cote d'Ivoire -- like the Asian dragons -- an African elephant 
of which Ivorians and Africans would be proud. An African 
elephant, that is, a country with a solid, sound, and 
diversified economy, capable of efficiently and victoriously 
resisting the various economic storms. An economy with an 
agriculturally and industrially diversified basis and a sector 
of functional services immune to variations in agricultural 
product prices. All these efforts would yield results only if 
peace prevails as President Henri Konan Bedie stressed on May 
Day. A peace that was dear to our founding father, late 
President Felix Houphouet-Boigny. Therefore, we must continue 
to work together under the high authority of President Henri 
Konan Bedie for a better future for Cote d'Ivoire and in order 
to see this great Ivorian dream come true. Thank you. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] The government has announced its intention to 
station a permanent battalion in the north-eastern part of the 
country. This is to enable the military to be in a better 
position to quickly respond to future conflict situations in the 
area. The minister of defense, Alhaji Mahama Iddrisu, announced 
this in Parliament today, during a brief on the inter-ethnic 
conflict in the Northern Region. 
  Alhaji Mahama, who is also the chairman of the National 
Emergency Committee, said it is the view of the committee that 
the stationing of such a battalion will ensure the traditional 
presence of the Army in this conflict-prone area. 
  As a temporary measure, the defense minister said, even 
though the military will hand over to the police in the conflict 
zone, it will continue to maintain a limited presence at places 
it considers as priority areas. These include Salaga, Yendi, 
Krachi, and Saboba districts. 
  The House approved the appointments of Major Emmanuel Tetteh 
as the Eastern Regional minister and Mr. Sam P. Yalley as deputy 
minister of environment, science, and technology.

  [Text] The authorities in Guinea say several senior 
military officers have been detained for allegedly plotting to 
overthrow the government of Lansana Conte. The president 
himself is out of the country, attending the OAU summit. From 
Conakry, Foday Fofana telexed this report. 
  According to relatives and colleagues, Commander (Keida 
Kourouma), head of the Parachutist Battalion and Commander 
(Ouphara Oulare), deputy chief of staff of the Air Force, were 
picked up on Thursday [9 June] and Friday last week, 
respectively. Both men are now held in open detention at the 
National Gendarmerie Headquarters in Conakry. Although an 
officer there denied they were holding (Kouroma) and (Oulare), a 
colleague and myself spotted (Kouroma) in civilian clothes 
entering the room where he is being held. 
  Meanwhile, tension is believed to be mounting inside the 
Alpha Yaya military base here following an attempted mutiny by 
soldiers there yesterday. An eyewitness told me last night that 
soldiers loyal to the detained officers had wanted to storm the 
ammunition depot, arm themselves, and move on the Gendarmerie 
Headquarters in the heart of the capital to free their 
superiors, but the timely intervention of other senior military 
officers succeeded in calming down the situation, the eyewitness 
said. 
  The arrest coincides with the retirement of some 200 senior 
officers ordered by President Conte last Saturday. Defense 
Minister Colonel Abdourahmane Diallo was not available for 
comment but his permanent secretary, Captain Camara, could only 
say that the judicial arm of the Army is still investigating. 
  Despite reports that the detained officers were not being 
tortured, Mr. Christian Sow of the Guinea Human Rights 
Association has said the best guarantee is to have access to the 
detainees in order to ascertain that they were not denied food 
or medical treatment if need be.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program, hosted by Alice Martin] </F>
  [Text] In Guinea-Bissau, it is three weeks until 
presidential and parliamentary elections are due to be held. 
Following a number of delays and what appeared to be 
considerable reluctance on the part of the head of state, 
President Nino Vieira, to endorse the electoral process, a 
census was finally held last month. An electoral list has been 
drawn up and a new date, Sunday July 3, has been fixed. The 
election campaign officially opens today, but it seems 
campaigning has not got off to a good start. I asked the 
British honorary consul in Bissau, John Van Marnan, who is an 
observer of the electoral process, if he thought the parties 
were ready for electioneering. 
  [Begin recording] [Van Marnan] Most of them are....[pauses] 
The thing is that, apparently, there are already rich parties 
and poor parties, and some of the rich parties consider 
themselves to be big parties. There is a subsidy of state worth 
a total of $400,000 to be divided among the parties, and they 
desperately need the funds to actually start the campaign. As 
far as I know, the government hasn't paid this money yet, but I 
have information that payment will be made on Monday [13 June] 
or Tuesday next week. The parties will need vehicles, and 
transport, and bicycles, and all that to meet the electorate, 
and it is already a small setback on the campaign because of the 
lack of funds that the campaign can't really start today. 
  [Martin] And which parties are asking for more money? When 
you refer to rich parties and poor parties, who are the ones you 
think are rich and who are the ones who are demanding more 
facilities? 
  [Van Marnan] Well, as far as I know, the PCD [expansion 
unknown] party, for example, is supported. The president of the 
PCD party is a big businessman in Bissau. So, probably, a lot 
of private money is pumped into this party. Also, Guinea-Bissau 
Resistance-Bafata Movement has a fairly strong support, as far 
as people say, from the Guineans living in Portugal. The PAIGC 
[African Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape 
Verde] doesn't seem to have too many lacks of funds. On the 
other hand, the smaller parties that lived off contributions 
from their friends, they really have difficulties to get ends 
meet as far as money is concerned. [sentence as heard]. 
  [Martin] Who is going to resolve the issue of the money? Is 
it up to the National Electoral Commission? 
  [Van Marnan] Well, I know there is going to be an emergency 
meeting on Monday to decide how to divide the $400,000 made 
available by the government, and it seems the most logical 
division of the money will be that everybody sort of receives 
the same amount. 
  [Martin] You suggested that the PAIGC, the ruling party, 
were 
in a strong position. Obviously, they have been in government 
and they have a certain hold on the administrative structures in 
the country. Are there any other reasons why you feel that they 
are strong? 
  [Van Marnan] Well, we just watch television, and we see that 
every time there is a public speech by the president, there are 
an awful lot of people there, and the whole town is already 
covered by big posters of head of the president and Vote for 
Nino Vieira, and that also gives the impression that they have 
done a lot already, and it gives an impression of being there, 
while many of the other parties haven't put any poster up yet. 
(?Also) I have seen Bafata posters and I have seen PCD posters, 
and there is this other independent candidate for the 
presidency, (Carlos Gomez), and he is there with big posters, 
but from all the others I haven't seen anything yet. [end

  [Text] There are reports of intensive fighting in Harbel 
Firestone between the so-called Liberian Peace Council [LPC] and 
the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia]. According to 
the commander in chief of the NPFL, Charles Gankay Taylor, the 
renegade LPC assisted by Nigerian soldiers attacked NPFL 
positions in Compound No.2 in Grand Bassa County and the 
Firestone areas over the weekend. The NPFL leader said it is 
clear that the NPFL will not accept the blatant abuse of 
peacekeeping by ECOMOG in Liberia and its continued acts of 
destruction and killings of Liberians. 
  Since recent pronouncements by the U.S. Government 
confirming 
that Nigeria has been aiding and abetting armed groups, 
particularly the LPC and ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for 
in Liberia] against the NPFL, ECOMOG is continuously escalating 
the war in Liberia. 
  According to citizens fleeing out of the area, the rage of 
terror has hit the Harbel Firestone and Kakata areas with ECOMOG 
arresting citizens and skinning them alive, and selling human 
parts for meat in Kakata area and other areas. The NPFL leader 
is calling on the international community and the United Nations 
to immediately conduct investigations into the behavior of 
ECOMOG in Liberia and enforce measures that could make them 
desist from such practices.

  [Text] The NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] says 
the Nigerian contingent of ECOMOG [Economic Community of West 
African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] is continuing its 
disrespect for the Government and Constitution of the Republic 
of Liberia. 
  According to an NPFL press release, the arrest and 
imprisonment of thousands of Liberians by ECOMOG on grounds of 
merrymaking and curfew violation shatters the pride of the 
Liberian people. The NPFL release says ECOMOG cannot be 
permitted to play the role of being a judge, jury, and 
executioner in the Liberian conflict when there is a 
constitutional government to give clearly-defined instructions. 
  The NPFL is, therefore, calling on the people of Liberia, 
especially those in Monrovia, to be vigilant in protecting the 
civil liberties of the nation.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of resolution adopted by National Assembly on 13 </F>
June -- read by Assembly member Abucar Anga Toure] 
  [Text] Considering the state of insecurity in the northern 
regions of our country, considering that it is public knowledge 
that the integrated soldiers and the grassroot combatants are 
the cause of this unstable climate, considering the creation of 
new movements based on a self-defense policy, considering the 
need to prevent social troubles that could be triggered by this 
new trend, the National Assembly hereby demands that the Unified 
Movements and Front of Azaouad take control of the grassroot 
elements. The assembly calls on the government to use all legal 
means possible to put an end to the insecurity prevailing in the 
north by deploying special units, reinforcing military presence, 
and training the Armed Forces and security forces so they may 
fulfill their mission. 
  Th government should redeploy the integrated combatants 
throughout the national territory and set up camps to train them 
to observe strict military discipline. This means that any other 
combatants should be evacuated from cities and villages. The 
destruction of all combatant bases should be done concurrently 
with the integration of the combatants into the government 
forces.

  [Text] The Supreme Court's constitutional chamber has 
handed down its verdict concerning the request made by the 
parliamentary opposition about the lifting of its deputies' 
parliamentary immunity. In its 10 June verdict, the 
constitutional chamber said that the National Assembly's 23 
April Resolution No. 004AN on the lifting of some deputies's 
immunity is unconstitutional. This is because it is not in 
conformity with Article 70, paragraphs 1 and 3, of the 
Constitution as well as Articles 43 and 44 of the National 
Assembly's rules of procedure. The chamber also said that the 
way the National Assembly's request was made was in defiance of 
the Constitution's Articles 79 and 89. It, therefore, declared 
the resolution null and void.

  [Text] The Federal Military Government says it has 
uncovered plans to incite violence in parts of the country. A 
statement from the office of the chief of general staff today 
stated that reports have reached the government that some 
disgruntled elements [words indistinct] to champion the cause of 
12 June elections, have been hatching plans to precipitate 
sectional violence. It said that the (?elements) had disbursed 
large sums of money to recruit touts and miscreants in the 
western part of the country for an instruction to attack 
innocent people. The government stated that the aim of these 
disgruntled elements was to provoke a retaliation to such an 
attack in a bid to create a nationwide chaos. It said that law 
enforcement agencies had taken measures to track down those 
responsible and their collaborators. 
  The law enforcement agencies have (?therefore) been directed 
to beef up security in the western part of the country and to 
deal decisively with any person or group [words indistinct]. 
The government reassured the public of protection of lives and 
property and asked Nigerians to feel free to go about their 
lawful pursuits in any part of the country they live. It 
expressed appreciation of the mature understanding and 
cooperation so far demonstrated by Nigerians in ensuring the 
failure of the devilish schemes of troublemakers going about as 
democrats. The government reaffirmed that its decision to 
establish an enduring democratic order was not negotiable and 
asked all Nigerians to remain vigilant.

  [Text] Lagos, 14 Jun (PANA) -- Two federal courts in Lagos 
on Tuesday [14 June] gave separate rulings ordering Nigeria's 
military government to produce a civil rights activist and a 
newspaper editor detained over the country's current political 
crisis. 
  In one of the cases, Justice Victor Egbedon ruled that Beko 
Ransome-Kuti, detained chairman of the anti-military pressure 
group, Campaign for Democracy (CD) must be produced before the 
court on 22 June, the day he fixed for the case's next hearing. 
  The CD called a largely ignored week-long sit-at-home 
strike, 
which began on Monday as part of pro-democracy moves to force 
the military to surrender power. 
  Beko's lawyer, Gani Fawehinmi, submitted in court that his 
client's arrest and detention on 19 June was a violation of his 
constitutional rights. He also described as illegal, the 
security search carried out in Beko's residence, adding that the 
court should allow a doctor to see his client. 
  In the other case, Justice Tajudeen Odo o, of another 
federal 
high court in Lagos, ordered the government to produce in court 
on June 20, Bola Bolawole, the detained editor of 
privately-owned PUNCH newspaper. 
  The suit was filed on behalf of Bolawole by the same Lagos 
lawyer Fawehinmi, who also urged the court to declare illegal, 
the sealing off of the PUNCH newspaper premises by security 
agents last Saturday. 
  The Nigerian police have accused some local newspaper houses 
of "storing arms". The second newspaper organisation, Concord 
Press, shut down over the political crisis, has also filed a 1 
billion naira (22 naira: 1 U.S. dollar) suit challenging the 
government action. Hearing in the case was fixed for 27 June. 
  The CONCORD is owned by millionaire Moshood Abiola, who is 
wanted by the Nigerian police after he proclaimed himself 
president last Saturday, based on the 12 June 1993 presidential 
election, which was annulled by former military ruler, Gen. 
Ibrahim Babangida. Abiola claimed he won that election. 
  A number of pro-democracy activists have been arrested, 
released or charged [word indistinct] government activities in 
the past week in the West African country. 
  In another court case Tuesday, Justice Babatunde Belgore of 
a federal high court in Lagos, [words indistinct] senators of 
Nigeria's aborted Third Republic. The judge said the 
prosecution had failed to prove to him that his court had 
jurisdiction to try the accused persons for the alleged offense. 
  Former senators Maconyemechi Nwalu, Onyeka Amadi Okorafor 
and Abu Ibrahim, were arraigned on two-count charges of felony 
and alleged "intention to remove the head of state, Gen. Sani 
Abacha, through unconstitutional means". The three pleaded not 
guilty to the second charge and were later granted bail. Their 
case was adjourned until 22 june.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] The escape of Chief M.K.O. Abiola, the former 
presidential candidate of the defunct Social Democratic Party, 
SDP, from his domain, continues to receive attention from the 
newspapers. One of them, the DAILY SKETCH, reports that the 
Nigeria police have explained Chief Abiola's escape, in which 
the force denied any complicity in the event. The paper notes 
that this angle to the political situation calls for explanation 
in order to disabuse the minds of those who believed that 
policemen were in Chief Abiola's house when he escaped. The 
SKETCH quotes the police as saying that Chief Abiola, who was 
alleged to have declared himself president of Nigeria on 
Saturday [11 June] disguised as a woman and escaped from his 
Ikeja residence in Lagos. The paper reports that this incident 
happened before the arrival of the police. 
  Although the police refuted the story that Chief Abiola 
declared himself president on Saturday, THE GUARDIAN on his 
front page has a picture of Chief Abiola and his agents at 
Ekpetedo in Lagos, where he was purported to have announced his 
presidency in respect of the annulled 12 June presidential 
election last year by the former military regime. 
  In a related story, the SKETCH reports that some eminent 
Nigerians have called for dialogue as a positive means of 
resolving the political situation in the country. It quotes the 
Archbishop of Lagos, Dr. Anthony Olufomi Okoje, as stating that 
democracy could not be achieved through violence, force, or in a 
chaotic situation. Rather, it would be achieved in an atmosphere 
of peace. 
  Reporting on the same story, THE GUARDIAN has it that the 
Nobel laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, wants the Abiola and 
Abacha camp to use dialogue instead of confrontation to achieve 
peace in Nigeria. On its part, the LAGOS HORIZON described the 
situation in Lagos yesterday, Monday, in its lead story as that 
of an uneasy calm in the state. It adds that workers were at 
their duty posts even though transport was light because many 
transport operators stayed off the roads, and the petrol 
stations were locked up to avoid molestation by some 
pro-democracy groups. 
  However, the DAILY TIMES reports that there were pockets of 
protests in some parts of Lagos by pro-democracy activists who 
called on the military to quit politics in Nigeria. According 
to the paper, these were peaceful as some security agents were 
able to control the situation.

  [Text] Cape Town--The building of about 156 much-needed new 
schools for black children and extension and renovation work on 
hundreds of hospitals, clinics, schools and roads for this year 
are to be suspended so as to pay for the election. The 
government has instructed that all state budgets this year 
should be cut by 4 percent to recover election costs, BEELD 
discovered yesterday. 
  The total election costs that have to be recovered, 
including 
the expenses of the Independent Electoral Commission and DEBI 
[Democratic Electoral Broadcasting Initiative], amount to about 
2 billion rands. 
  As part of the state cutbacks, which affect all the regions 
and state departments in the country, state subsidies to all 
universities and technikons have been trimmed for the current 
financial year. 
  State and provincial budgets for among others education, 
health services and roads have also been trimmed down. 
Government orders for these cutbacks come in the wake of 
announcements by the government that a thousand additional posts 
for civil servants are to be created as soon as possible. 
  These cutbacks also occur at a time when cutbacks in the 
Cape 
health services are unavoidable and educational services 
countrywide are experiencing lean times. These cutbacks are 
unique and are the sacrifices which have to be made for South 
Africa's first democratic election, Western Cape MEC [Member of 
the Executive Council] for finance, Mr. Kobus Meiring, confirmed. 
  By virtue of the fact that these cutbacks are unique, mainly 
capital expenditures and maintenance costs will have to be 
trimmed dramatically. 
  The Western Cape provincial authority will, like other 
provincial and central authorities, do everything in its power 
not to trim any personnel posts due to the cutbacks, Mr. Meiring 
said. 
  The country's total education budget has been cut back by 
about 200 million rands, Western Cape MEC for education Martha 
Olckers said in response to a question. Most of the money is 
being deducted from mainly white education. However, 41 million 
rands also has to be taken from schools in colored residential 
areas. 
  Although everything possible is being done countrywide to 
cut 
the budget for black education as little as possible, the 
cutback will affect the building of about 156 new schools in 
black townships. The building of these new schools has been 
postponed from last year to this year due to a budgetary 
shortfall. 
  There are indications that renovation and extension work to 
schools and classrooms of most schools will have to be put on 
hold.

  [Text] Eight public enterprises, including Transnet 
[Transportation Network] and Eskom [Electricity Supply 
Commission] have been identified as likely to play a key role in 
rebuilding and revitalizing the economy. The enterprises are 
said to be substantial earners of vital foreign exchange. 
Zinhle Fithane reports. 
  [Begin recording] [Fithane] Addressing a media conference at 
the Union Buildings in Pretoria today, Public Enterprise 
Minister Princess Stella Sicgau said Eskom's primary role was to 
provide electricity in the rural areas. Eskom has already 
incorporated all the electricity facilities previously run by 
the TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states and 
are confident that they will have the ball rolling by the end of 
the year. 
  [Eskom spokesman Bongani Khumalo] We are rolling. We are 
rolling now, and by the end of this year we will be fully in 
motion. We are talking to people in the past TBVC countries with 
a view to eventually taking over the supply of electricity. We 
are looking at the best options possible and we would like to 
see people in those areas electrified. You will be mindful of 
the fact that those people are mostly in the areas that could be 
classified as rural areas and this is a priority, as it is the 
priority of the new government -- that we should electrify those 
people. 
  [Fithane] Meanwhile, Public Works Minister Mr. Jeff Radebe 
has given a progress report on the implementation of a public 
works program. 
  [Radebe] The responsibility now rests on the government to 
ensure that the broad parameters and the contents of this 
important piece of work by the National Economic Forum is 
actually adopted by the government with the specific purpose of 
implementing it so that we start the process of solving the 
unemployment problem in our country. 
  [Fithane] In a lengthy report, the minister outlined the 
National Economic Forum's three-phase plan for a public works 
program. The three phases indicate how the program will be set 
up, but it will be at least another year before the program 
actually begins to create jobs. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Fidele Djessa] </F>
  [Excerpts] The recent vast movement of nominations that 
took place at the Paracommando Rapid Intervention Force [GATL] 
was not to the liking of some soldiers who expressed their 
displeasure in a leaflet that was not at all in favor of their 
new commandant. The government, which has turned a deaf ear to 
all unpleasant comments, has not hidden its intention to 
continue to "reorganize" the Army which it suspects is 
"unfaithful" on several accounts. 
  On 6 May at 1000, General Abdoulaye Coulibaly, former GATL 
commanding officer at the Abidjan Port-Bouet Air Base, handed 
over to Lieutenant Colonel Ettien Koffi, who was promoted to the 
rank of GATL commandant by President Henri Konan Bedie on 29 
April. [passage omitted] 
  "This promotion smells badly of tribalism," an officer who 
sought anonymity said. "Why didn't President Bedie chose 
Colonel Adama Dosso who, according to the hierarchy, is second 
to Gen. Coulibaly?" To substantiate his assertion, the officer 
gave the following explanation: "In case you do not know, in 
regard to hierarchy, after Gen. Coulibaly, there are Colonels 
Vassanoussi Bamba, Adama Dosso, Ettien Koya, and Leopold Guidi. 
Following them are Lieutenant Colonels Fofana Bourgoin and 
Boubacar Kouyate. All these officers come before Lt. Col. 
Ettien Koffi. 
  It is not surprising for one to evoke tribalism when things 
are not done the right way. Frankly, although I agree that it 
was time for Gen. Coulibaly to leave after such a long time as 
GATL commandant -- although I think his dismissal was done in a 
gross manner -- I cannot accept the fact that the Army is being 
politicized with nominations that are not in line with military 
order and discipline. In my opinion, the Army should put itself 
above all political maneuvers for the security of the country." 
[passage omitted] 
  These allegations are false, counterattacked "strategists" 
from the Presidential Palace who agreed to talk to us 
unofficially on the real reasons for the appointment by the head 
of state. They said, right after the appointment of the 
general, we were confronted with a regional problem that was 
threatening the security of the state. We absolutely agree with 
those who expressed their discontent, saying that Gen. Coulibaly 
is followed by Col. Vassanoussi Bamba and Col. Adama Dosso. 
However, what people pretend to ignore is that to giving the 
command of the GATL to one of these two would mean concentrating 
the command of two major units -- and we are talking about the 
Armed Forces here -- in the hands of two officers from the same 
region, namely Touba. Colonels Vassanoussi Bamba and Adama 
Dosso, like the commanding officer of the national Navy, are 
both from Touba. This fact could not be overlooked in a context 
such as ours." [passage omitted] 
  All these real or supposed conflicts make the Armed Forces 
of 
Cote d'Ivoire a powder keg that could explode at any moment 
because of the deteriorating social structure. 
  [Abidjan LA VOIE in French adds the following in its 9 June 
edition: "The news which was being kept secret has finally 
leaked out. Col. Faizan Bi Sehi has been dismissed from the 
command of the Paracommando Rapid Intervention Force. On 
reasons behind the dismissal, various versions have been 
advanced including a story on high interest loan repayments 
deducted at source from soldiers' pay by someone close to Col. 
Faizan Bi Sehi. In fact, this measure is nothing compared with 
rumors of forthcoming measures on the punitive transfer of 
officers, which are masterminded by the strategists and other 
advisors of President Bedie the self-proclaimed president of the 
Republic of Cote d'Ivoire.]

  [Excerpts] The proceedings of the 30th OAU summit ended at 
noon today. The final session was distinguished by the keynote 
address given by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, the current 
president of the OAU. The president confirmed that Tunisia 
would spare no effort during its OAU presidency to serve the 
interests of the continent. He expressed his firm hope that our 
continent would be saved from the destructive conflicts with 
which it is burdened. He pointed out that the steps taken by the 
Tunis summit to settle the conflict in Rwanda were a good sign 
of hope for all similar issues. 
  President Ben Ali stressed that the consensus shown by the 
African continent over the charter of honor [mithaq al-sharaf] 
proposed by Tunisia was a civilized commitment arising from 
African civilization values based on tolerance and emphasizing 
the need for communal joint work. 
  He lauded the eagerness shown by the delegations to 
implement 
the strategy of the Abuja agreement on African economic 
integration. The president insisted on the need for 
self-reliance in our African countries in order to get out of 
our current situation, stressing the need for Africans to 
establish their ability to be partners of advanced states and to 
deal as equals with all countries if they wanted those countries 
to be at their side. 
  The president lauded the firm determination shown by our 
African countries in supporting the OAU in serving the 
continent's issues. [passage omitted] 
  President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali officially announced the 
closing of the 30th OAU conference at noon. 
  Yesterday afternoon's session continued until late at night. 
During the session the African leaders completed their 
examination of all the points on the agenda.

<F P=106> [Speech by Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in </F>
Tunis on 15 June--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. Your majesties, your excellencies, ladies and 
gentlemen: We are now, with God's guidance and blessing, about 
to conclude our 30th regular summit meeting following three days 
of constructive talks and in-depth consultations on the 
situation on our African continent and on its future. [passage 
omitted] 
  Ladies and gentlemen: Thinking of a way to achieve the 
difficult balance between peace, security, and stability on the 
one hand, and development on the other, was at the focal point 
of our interest during this entire session. This was out of our 
belief in the tight link between these two elements. This has 
been reflected in all the results of our proceedings, as we 
exerted a large part of our efforts in examining ways to 
entrench the foundations of peace, security, and stability on 
our continent, not only by endeavoring to resolve tensions, but 
also by working to prevent any reasons that are likely to cause 
them. 
  Therefore, in our multilateral or bilateral talks, we 
devoted 
a great deal of interest to the settlement of conflicts raging 
in some of the African countries. We have been pleased at the 
first signs of detente that have begun to show in some of them. 
We have also tried as best as we could in some other cases to 
bring the conflicting sides closer and to urge them to look at 
the interests of their peoples before any other mutual and 
temporary considerations. 
  In this context, we have been satisfied with the cease-fire 
agreement reached by the two conflicting sides in Rwanda and 
their agreement to resort to dialogue and negotiation to settle 
the conflict between them. We consider the agreement reached 
here in Tunis on the occasion of this summit as a sign of hope 
with regard to similar issues. We have no doubt that your 
unanimity in adopting the honor charter--proposed by Tunisia as 
an additional tool to organize the links between our 
countries--constitutes a civilized commitment stemming from the 
deep-rooted heritage of our continent, which is based on the 
values of brotherhood, solidarity, and forgiveness. 
  Also, the eagerness shown by our states to support a 
mechanism to prevent conflicts and to manage and resolve 
them--and their readiness to participate in providing what is 
necessary to enable them to fully play their role--embodies the 
determination of all of us to rid our continent of the causes of 
conflict and its tragic consequences. [passage omitted] 
  Your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, in light of the 
profound changes witnessed in our contemporary world, it has 
become generally accepted that devoting ourselves to development 
is the only means of preparing to face the challenges of the 
next century. 
  Our realization of this fact was behind the special 
attention 
that we have given to the issue of development in our continent. 
[passage omitted] 
  We would like, in this context, to stop at two fundamental 
observations, the first of which is reflected in the keen 
interest shown by all the delegations in finalizing the Abuja 
treaty, which created the African economic community and the 
resolve to implement the strategy it had drawn within the 
framework of the endeavor to achieve more African integration 
and unification. 
  The second observation, which is closely linked to the 
first, 
is related to the necessity for coordinated, collective work to 
adapt to the new world market that will emerge in the shadow of 
the world trade organization. Undoubtedly, this market--which 
will be dominated by competition--will not be compassionate 
toward the weak. Therefore, we are called upon to carry out 
organized and patient work--not only to tackle the current 
situation, but also to look to the future and its possibilities 
in order to avoid being surprised with more pressures and 
restrictions that could be applied on us and could increasingly 
prevent our peoples from enjoying their resources. 
  Your majesties, your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen: We 
cannot, at the end of our speech, help but praise our countries' 
firm determination to bolster the OAU and its structures and to 
furnish it with the necessary human and material means to carry 
out its tasks and services to our continent. 
  We would like to thank the OAU secretariat and all those who 
are working there for their tireless efforts. We would like to 
reiterate to them our total support. Also, we would like here 
to thank the media organizations and journalists for their 
coverage of this summit. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In its 30th session, the OAU summit endorsed a 
number of draft statements and decisions in connection with the 
political conflicts in some African countries and the economic 
and social conditions in the continent. Among the documents 
which the summit endorsed are the following: 
  1. The Tunis declaration on AIDS and child in Africa. 
  2. A declaration about the adoption of rules of behavior 
in relations between African countries. 
  3. The declaration of the heads of states and governments 
on the situation in Angola. 
  4. The special declaration on the population and 
development in Africa. 
  5. A declaration on social development. 
  6. The Tunis declaration on the OAU's agreement of 1969 
which defines specific aspects of the problems of refugees in 
Africa. 
  7. A decision on terminating the work of the OAU's 
liberation committee. 
  8. A decision on assessing the results of the Uruguay 
round of the GATT multilateral trade talks. 
  8. [as heard] A decision on the African committee for 
human and peoples' rights. 
  9. A decision on the African economic community. 
  10. A decision on the issue of the Comoros Mayotte island. 
  Regarding the Tunis declaration on children and AIDS in 
Africa, African states stressed their commitment to take a 
series of measures to protect the youth against the contagion of 
this disease through strategies based on moral values of African 
society and proper education at schools as well as necessary 
health care and specially promoted legislation. 
  Regarding the declaration on the situation in Angola, 
African 
states welcomed the acceptance by the Angolan Government of the 
proposals on national reconciliation and the efforts and the 
initiatives made by the United Nations to build trust between 
the parties and put forward proposals to reach compromise 
solutions on highly sensitive matters to both the parties to the 
conflicts. 
  In the declaration on the population and development in 
Africa, African countries confirmed their commitment to making 
utmost efforts to allow women to assume their full role in 
society and ensure a comprehensive dealing with the issue of 
promoting youth activities. African leaders asked the African 
population committee to cooperate with similar establishments 
regarding the implementation of population activities in Africa. 
  In the declaration on social development, African countries 
stressed the need to bolster democracy based on the principle of 
participation, encourage initiatives and forms of organization 
which would allow African societies to influence development and 
rely on their own abilities, a factor which would immunize them 
against all kinds of violence, extremism and discrimination. In 
the sphere of the protection of refugees, African leaders 
highlighted the continuing displacement crises in the African 
continent and confirmed their genuine determination to eradicate 
the cause of the phenomenon of influx of refugees in Africa 
which is home to the highest number of refugees and displaced in 
the world. 
  African leaders, in the resolution in connection with 
terminating the work of the OAU liberation committee, expressed 
their deep appreciation for all the OAU member states and the 
international community as a whole and the good role the 
committee had played during the struggle against colonialism and 
apartheid. The summit issued its directives to convene a 
one-day extraordinary OAU summit in Tanzania at the beginning or 
the end of next August for this purpose. 
  In the decision on the results of the Uruguay round, the 
African summit expressed its concern over the possibility of 
decreasing to a great extent the priorities which most African 
countries have enjoyed until now. The summit appealed to the UN 
development program and GATT, and other donor institutions, to 
provide necessary financial aid technical assistance to this 
purpose. 
  In its resolution regarding the African human and peoples' 
rights committee, the African summit stressed the emphasis which 
should be put on the importance of the OAU member states 
observing human and peoples' rights as a further guarantee to 
achieve peace, stability, and development in Africa. The summit 
called on member states to take tangible arrangements to put 
into practice the provisions of the African charter on human and 
peoples' rights. 
  In its resolution in connection with the African economic 
community, African countries reiterated their determination to 
implement the constituent agreement of this community and their 
commitment to it throughout all the phases stipulated in the 
agreement.

  [Text] In response to President Ben Ali's appeal in his 
opening speech of the 30th OAU summit, in which he called for 
the drawing up of a code of conduct to organize relations 
between the African continent's countries on the basis of their 
commitment to the principles and goals of the Organization of 
African Unity and the United Nations -- for this is of great 
importance for preserving the security of African societies and 
their stability. 
  At the end of its meetings in Tunis today, the 30th OAU 
summit approved a declaration that included a set of rules in 
this regard and in which African countries stressed the 
following: 
  1. Their intention to intensify political consultations and 
to broaden the scope of cooperation in order to sort out 
economic, social, environmental, cultural, and humanitarian 
difficulties. 
  2. Their will that Africa be a source of peace and be open 
to 
dialogue and cooperation with the rest of the world, supportive

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by OAU Secretary General Salim </F>
Ahmed Salim with unidentified correspondents in Tunis on 15 June] 
  [Excerpts] At the end of OAU's 30th summit the 
organizations' secretary general held a news conference at which 
the Tunisian minister of foreign affairs was present. Our 
correspondent prepared this report. 
  [Correspondent] The news conference held by Mr Salim Ahmed 
Salim, the OAU secretary general, ended a short while ago and 
was attended by Habib Ben Yahia, the minister of foreign 
affairs. [passage omitted] 
  The secretary general said the summit had seen the 
participation of all the heads of state in the discussions, 
either during the plenary sessions or the closed ones. The 
African leaders discussed the points on the agenda, focusing 
mainly on solving conflicts and disputes--especially events in 
Rwanda. The summit was crowned with considerable achievements 
in this regard. Some delegations expressed their readiness to 
send peacekeeping contingents to this country. 
  Among the important results achieved in Tunisia's summit, 
the 
OAU secretary general said, a body, entrusted with settling 
conflicts, was set up. This body will hold regular meetings to 
take preventive measures against conflicts and problems and will 
consist of Tunisia, Cote d'Ivoire, Mauritius, Benin, Nigeria, 
Egypt, Ethiopia, and Chad. 
  Among the results, there is also the holding of an 
extraordinary summit to discuss economic issues. 
  In reply to a question on why democracy and human rights 
issues were not discussed in this summit, the secretary general 
said the OAU was committed to these issues as they are issues of 
international interest. He stressed that establishing democracy 
and the respect of human rights in Africa was of paramount 
importance and a matter of principle to his organization. 
  Regarding the financial status of the OAU, Mr Salim Ahmed 
Salim said there was a number of countries who have not payed 
their financial commitments to the organization which is 
experiencing a critical financial situation. He called on the 
member states to pay their contributions so the OAU can carry 
out its role and duties, pointing out that the summit stressed 
the importance of preventive diplomacy, which requires regular 
payment of financial contributions. He said that during 
Tunisia's summit some member states paid their contributions. 
[passage omitted] 
  The next OAU summit will be held in the Ethiopian capital, 
Addis Ababa.

  [Text] Tunis June 15 SAPA -- South Africa has been 
nominated to serve on a high-profile committee which will steer 
the Organisation for African Unity's mechanism for conflict 
prevention, management and resolution, OAU Secretary-General 
Salim Ahmed Salim said on Wednesday [15 June]. At a press 
conference to mark the end of the two-day heads of state summit, 
he said the committee would deal with African conflicts at 
ambassadorial, ministerial and summit levels. 
  It would implement an early-warning system to identify 
potential flashpoints and introduce measures to manage and 
resolve conflicts throughout the continent. 
  Other African states serving on the committee are Tunisia, 
Ivory Coast, Mauritius, Benin, Chad, Egypt and Ethiopia. 
  Dr Salim said the mechanism, established in Cairo last year, 
needed financial support to function efficiently. 
  He said conflict resolution and peace-keeping had enjoyed a 
high priority in the leaders' summit. 
  "There was a clear determination to see an end to the 
conflicts plagueing Africa. This culminated in the significant 
achievement of the agreement by both parties in the Rwanda 
conflict to introduce an immediate ceasefire." 
  Dr Salim said the Rwanda Government and rebel forces were 
both committed to ending the devastating civil war and allowing 
the United Nations troops to provide protection and humanitarian 
assistance to refugees displaced by the conflict. 
  Zimbabwe, Ghana, Ethiopia, Senegal and Zambia have each 
contributed a batallion of 800 men to the UN mission in Rwanda 
while Mali, Nigeria and Congo would send about 100 soldiers each. 
  South Africa had pledged humanitarian assistance and 
possibly 
logistical support in the form of approved personnel carriers. 
  Dr Salim also praised South Africa for paying its OAU 
membership subscription in full and called on member states who 
are in arrears to emulate their example. 
  He said the best contribution South Africa could make to 
Africa was to remain a united, stable and peaceful society. 
  In the long term, South Africa would contribute 
significantly 
to the OAU and Africa, particularly in the sub-continent. 
  "We can expect South Africa in the future to play a major 
economic, political and security role in the continent," he said.

  [Text] Tunis -- The South African [SA] Government would 
give serious consideration to requests for reparations from 
countries that had suffered damage from the actions of previous 
governments, President Mandela said in Tunis yesterday. 
  And it emerged that Mandela is being seen by fellow African 
heads of state as a key to mediating in the Rwandan and Angolan 
wars. Mandela's spokesman, Joel Netshitenzhe, said yesterday 
both Rwandan government and rebel representatives had asked to 
meet Mandela to seek his help in resolving the bloody conflict. 
He said Mandela would meet the two parties. 
  Addressing a press conference at the SA embassy in Tunis 
yesterday, Mandela also revealed he had discussed the Angolan 
war with President Eduardo dos Santos of Angola and President 
Mobutu of Zaire during the Organisation of African Unity summit 
in Tunis. 
  He reiterated his willingness to meet UNITA [Total 
Independence for the Liberation of Angola] leader Jonas Savimbi 
to help resolve the Angolan dispute. 
  On possible reparations by South Africa to African 
countries, 
he said no compensation would be offered to countries that had 
helped in the liberation struggle because they had done it not 
for reward but from a sense of duty. 
  Mandela was asked how the Government would respond to 
requests for reparations in the light of indications that the 
Angolan government might seek such payments. 
  "We are prepared to discuss issues with the aim of resolving 
past differences, and if we have the resources and there is a 
demand that we should make reparations we will have to consider 
that matter seriously". 
  He said that if a complaint was made by a neighbouring 
country about damage done by the previous government "we cannot 
take the attitude that, look this was a minority government, we 
are not responsible for its crimes. 
  "But the matter will have to be discussed very carefully. 
  "We too were involved in the struggle as organisations and 
as 
people not affiliated to any particular organisation. 
  "Now that we are free we are not going to give any material 
resources to the people who took part in the struggle other than 
to help to raise their living standards to ensure that they have 
a secure future. 
  "It was in that spirit that the continent of Africa helped 
us." 
  Asked whether Deputy President F.W. de Klerk's failure to 
attend certain recent functions indicated a split between him 
and the president, Mandela said both he and De Klerk at times 
had to miss functions because of the pressure of other duties.

  [Text] Bujumbura, June 15 (AFP) -- Fears that ethnic 
fighting in Rwanda is spreading to neighbouring Burundi 
increased Wednesday [15 June] as aid officials questioned who 
was to blame for a massacre of 100 refugees in the north of the 
country. 
  The massacre Monday in Bugabira, in the northern province of 
Kirundo, was initially reported to have been carried out by 
Rwandan Hutu militants on Tutsi refugees. 
  But UN High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] envoy here 
Shelly Peterman said there were signs that the victims of the 
slaughter were Hutus. Other aid officials allege the killings 
were carried out by members of the Tutsi-led Burundi army. 
  Peterman said UNHCR staff had attended the arrival at 
Bugabira of some 500 Rwandan refugees fleeing their own country. 
The following day the staff returned to find 100 of them dead, 
he said. 
  He declined to speculate who was responsible, saying that 
was 
for the official investigation to determine. 
  Military authorities meanwhile reported clashes between 
armed 
gangs at Kayanza in northern Burundi, with about 20 people dead 
in the last few days. Some observers dispute the figure, saying 
the toll was higher. 
  Clashes were also reported in the hills to the east of 
Bujumbura, where armed forces are fighting Hutu extremists 
chased out of the suburb of Kamenge about two months ago.

  [Text] Tension suddenly rose at the Libreville University 
campus this morning with cases of violence reported. The 
rector's office was completely ransacked and computer equipment 
destroyed. The rector was molested while an Africa No. 1 
correpondent and a lecturer were severely beaten up with the 
lecturer presently in hospital. These unimaginable acts took 
the place of a referendum scheduled on the campus for students 
to decide whether or not they agree to resume lectures, which 
they have boycotted since 26 May. 
  Meanwhile, students of Omar Bongo University, Libreville, 
have embarked on a strike to back up a demand for a 19-percent 
increase in their stipends to cushion the effects of the 
devaluation of the CFA franc, which will bring their monthly 
stipend from 63,000 to 75,000 CFA francs. The Government of 
Gabon, which is currently engaged in negotiations with the IMF 
and the World Bank for the redress of the economy, says it 
cannot go beyond the 14 billion CFA francs allocated for 
stipends. It says the best it can do is to raise the stipends 
from 63,000 to 66,000 francs, and to reduce rents on campus by 
2,000 francs. Students find these measures ridiculous. 
  Apparently, following this morning's violence on the campus, 
chances for the continuation of negotiations between the rector 
and students have practically evaporated, and it quite likely 
that the university will be closed down before the end of the 
academic year.

  [Text] Kigali, June 15 (AFP) -- The guns fell silent in 
Rwanda's capital Kigali on Wednesday [15 June] after rebels and 
the government agreed to a ceasefire, a United Nations spokesman 
said. 
  Rebel artillery pounded central Kigali on Wednesday morning, 
but the fighting ended in the afternoon, UN spokesman Pierre 
Mehu said. 
  Some shells fell near a crowded market, and UN officials 
said 
they feared 60 adolescents had been abducted from a church 
compound and slaughtered Tuesday. 
  Mehu said he did not know whether the ceasefire was being 
respected, but no gunfire had been heard for two hours at 5:45 
p.m. (1545 GMT). 
  "It's been quite a while since there's been such a long 
pause 
in the fighting," Mehu said. 
  An immediate ceasefire was announced by Tunisian President 
Zine El Abidine Ben Ali at the closing session of the 
Organisation of African Unity summit in Tunis on Wednesday. 
  Ben Ali said Rwanda's bloodbath, in which up to half a 
million people have been slaughtered in two-and-a-half months, 
could be halted only through "dialogue and negotiation." 
  A mini-summit on Rwanda held on the sidelines of the meeting 
asked Tanzania to organise negotiations between the two sides on 
implementing peace accords signed in the Tanzanian town of 
Arusha last August. 
  The UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda expressed fears 
Wednesday 
that 60 adolescents had been massacred after being kidnapped on 
Tuesday, presumably by extremist Hutu militiamen, from a Kigali 
church where some 3,000 civilians are sheltering from the 
fighting. 
  "We understand that these people were led away and probably 
executed and buried," UN military spokesman Major Jean-Guy 
Plante said. 
  Militiamen blamed for much of the slaughter in Rwanda 
threatened to kill UN soldiers on Tuesday and prevented them 
from evacuating civilians to safe areas. 
  Mehu meanwhile confirmed that the rebels had captured the 
town of Gitarama where the interim government was formerly based. 
  "Gitarama is in the hands of the RPF," Mehu said. 
  The capture of Gitarama puts all-out victory within the 
rebels' grasp after a two-month offensive, analysts said. 
  Gitarama was the seat of an interim government proclaimed 
after the April 6 death of President Juvenal Habyarimana in a 
suspected rocket attack on his plane. The RPF seized the town 
from army soldiers and militiamen on Sunday. 
  Habyarimana's death rekindled civil war that had halted with 
last year's Arusha accord, triggering ethnic and political 
massacres in which up to half a million people were killed. 
  The outgoing UN special representative to Rwanda on 
Wednesday 
accused rebels and the government of genocide against their own 
people. 
  "The reality is that the RPF and the Rwandan Government have 
prepared for war and not peace and will have to bear their 
responsibility in history for the genocide they are inflicting 
on their own people," Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh said after 
resigning his post. 
  "In this context of widespread hatred and violence, the 
peace 
mission of foreigners and the UN seems out of place and very 
risky," he said. 
  "The solution to the Rwandan drama will come neither from 
abroad nor from the United Nations. After the continuing 
bloodbath, I think it is already too late for the Rwandans to 
extricate their country from the present chaos by themselves," 
he said in a statement issued in Nairobi. 
  He dismissed rebel accusations that he had backed the 
government as an attempt to "find scapegoats to justify an 
insane war which they are pursuing against all good sense." 
  Booh-Booh said he was happy to leave Rwanda, where the 
people 
"do not like each other." 
  UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has appointed a 
Pakistani diplomat, Mohamad Sharyar Khan, to replace Booh-Booh, 
from Cameroon, whom he praised for his "devotion to peace in 
Rwanda." 
  The UN withdrew all but 470 of its 2,500 peacekeepers from 
Rwanda after bloodletting engulfed the small central African 
country and 10 Belgian soldiers were killed. 
  Relief operations to millions of displaced people have 
ground 
to a halt and imminent famine threatens Rwanda. 
  UN military commander General Romeo Dallaire said earlier 
this week that a ceasefire was essential to getting desperately 
needed food and medicine to the needy.

    [Editorial report] (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura in French 
to Rwanda at 1030 GMT on 15 June reports that 40 children, ages 
10 to 14, who were abducted yesterday by MRND-CDR (Republican 
National Movement for Democracy and Development-Coalition for 
the Defense of the Republic) militias, have been killed. The 
children were reportedly taken from the Sainte-Famille Church in 
Kigali, where they had been sheltered. The radio says that, 
upon hearing of the abduction, UNAMIR (UN Assistance Mission in 
Rwanda) -- which was mediating talks between government forces 
and Rwanda Patriotic Army representatives -- sent government 
soldiers to investigate the incident. "Upon their return, they 
lied that the abductors had returned their victims," the radio 
said. "The truth is that after the abduction, the children were 
taken to a swamp. There were some shots. Not one child 
survived. They were killed because they were Tutsis."

  [Text] Nairobi, 15 Jun (AFP) -- The outgoing UN special 
representative to Rwanda on Wednesday [15 June] accused Rwandan 
rebels and the government of genocide against their own people 
in an ongoing ethnic bloodbath. "The reality is that the RPF 
(rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front) and the Rwandan Government have 
prepared for war and not peace and will have to bear their 
responsibility in history for the genocide they are inflicting 
on their own people," Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh said after

  Up to half a million people have been killed in 
two-and-a-half months of ethnic and political carnage unleashed 
by the April 6 death of president Juvenal Habyarimana in a 
suspected rocket attack on his plane. "In this context of

he said. "It is with sadness and pessimism that I leave the 
Rwandans reduced to this state of extreme distress through the 
fault of unscrupulous and short-sighted politicians," he said in 
a statement issued in Nairobi. 
  He dismissed accusations from the rebels, drawn from the 
minority Tutsis, that he backed the Hutu-majority government as 
an attempt to "find scapegoats to justify an insane war which 
they are pursuing against all good sense." Booh-Booh said he 
was happy to leave Rwanda, where the people "do not like each 
other." 
  UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has appointed a 
Pakistani diplomat, Mohamad Sharyar Khan, to replace Booh-Booh, 
from Cameroon, whom he praised for his "devotion to peace in 
Rwanda." 
  The United Nations posted troops to Rwanda to monitor a 
ceasefire and political accord -- now in tatters -- reached 
between the government and RPF in August last year. The UN 
force was drastically reduced to just 450 men after Belgian 
peacekeepers were slaughtered in April. UN Secretary-General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali has for a month been seeking to boost it to 
5,500 troops, mainly from other African countries.

  [Text] Nairobi, June 15 (AFP) -- A UN spokesman on 
Wednesday [15 June] confirmed that Rwandan rebels had captured 
the town of Gitarama where the interim government was formerly 
based. 
  "Gitarama is in the hands of the RPF (the rebel Rwanda 
Patriotic Front)," UN spokesman Pierre Mehu told AFP by 
telephone from Rwanda's capital Kigali. 
  The capture of Gitarama puts all-out victory within the 
rebels' grasp after a two-month offensive, analysts said. 
  Gitarama was the seat of a rump government proclaimed after 
the April 6 death of president Juvenal Habyarimana in a 
suspected rocket attack on his plane. The RPF seized the town 
from Army soldiers and militiamen on Sunday. 
  Habyarimana's death rekindled civil war and sparked ethnic 
and political massacres in which up to half a million people 
were killed. 
  The guns fell silent in Kigali on Wednesday after a 
ceasefire 
announcement, but Mehu could not confirm whether the truce was 
holding.

  [Excerpts] Nairobi, 16 Jun (AFP) -- Sporadic gunfire 
resumed in Kigali overnight after a lull of several hours 
following a ceasefire announcement, a UN spokesman said Thursday 
[16 June]. "There was sporadic firing during the night and a 
few rounds of artillery fire at five this morning (0300 GMT)," 
UN spokesman Pierre Mehu told AFP by telephone from Kigali. 
  Mehu said the guns had fallen silent for about five hours on 
Wednesday afternoon after Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben 
Ali announced at the end of the Organisation of African Unity 
(OAU) summit in Tunis that Rwanda's government and rebels had 
agreed to an immediate ceasefire. Gunfire resumed at dusk, Mehu 
said. 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe called in Paris 
Wednesday 
for western intervention to stop the ethnic bloodshed in Rwanda 
if the latest ceasefire there fails. He said he had suggested 
to UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali that UN troops from 
the 18,000-strong force stationed in Somalia could be diverted 
to Rwanda, if fighting there continues. 
  If the ceasefire is not respected and the massacres 
continue, 
"I say today that France would be ready to mount an intervention 
operation ... with its European partners or African countries 
to protect groups threatened with extermination," he said. "If 
we learn over the next few days that there are massacres of 
dozens, of hundreds of men, women and children, we will not be 
able to tolerate it for much longer. [passage omitted] 
  Juppe, speaking after a cabinet meeting with French 
President 
Francois Mitterrand, said the situation in Rwanda was "already 
unacceptable and that could lead us to mobilize France's 
partners to intervene" without delay. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The cease-fire concluded in Rwanda should have 
already come into effect. Until now the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic 
Front] was hostile to the principle of a truce: it considered 
that the fighting and the massacres had to be stopped at the 
same time. [passage omitted] 
  Dominique de Courcelles met with Theodore Sindikubwabo, the 
interim president of Rwanda. She asked him how this cease-fire 
will be implemented: 
  [Begin recording] [Sindikubwabo] The peace agreement was 
proposed by a facilitator and a mediator assisted by the OAU 
secretary general. So it is for them to announce it -- the OAU 
or the United Nations. 
  [De Courcelles] Today? 
  [Sindikubwabo] Today or perhaps tomorrow. They must announce 
that there is a cease-fire that has been agreed on. So they are 
to show the instruments of the cease-fire, in other words the 
documents, countersigned by both sides. Then we, as the 
government, will give orders to our troops and orders to the 
members of the government to ensure that this peace agreement is 
respected. [end recording]

  [Text] Government backed militias, Interahamwe, have 
extended their killings to neighboring countries. The militias, 
apart from the killings within Rwanda, are now also killing 
people in refugee camps, mainly in Tanzania and Burundi. The 
militias have organized gangs with code names and use whistles 
as their signals when carrying out their murderous plans. 
  Before the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] took up control of 
areas bordering Tanzania, the militias killed thousands of 
people, mainly the Tutsi and some Hutu in the opposition. Those 
who managed to escape these killings took refuge in Tanzania, 
making the first batch of refugees going to Tanzania since the 
war resumed in the month of April. When the RPF forces advanced 
and took over the areas of Kibungo, the militias also took to 
their heels, and sought refuge in Tanzania as the second batch 
of refugees. Thousands of pangas [machetes] that were used for 
killing were abandoned by the militias at Rusumo on the Rwandan 
side. The militias came to live in the same refugee camps with 
people who ran away from their acts of murder. Known militias, 
like Gatete, the former leader of Commune Murambi, and Mpambara, 
of Commune Rukara, who fled after untold mass killings in 
churches, are among the people who went to the refugee camps in 
Tanzania, and the Tanzanian authorities know very well that 
these militias are in their country. 
  The Tanzanian Government should be able to give security to 
the refugees and stop the killings done by militias in the 
refugee camps. Militias have killed people in the refugee camps 
at Ngara, but surprisingly the district commissioner of Ngara, 
Brigadier Alexander (Henedi) refuses to accept this. The UNHCR 
should do everything possible to save these people whose lives 
are threatened in countries of asylum. Occasionally, the 
refugees in Tanzania have been stopped by local authorities 
there, to go back to their country. Some have had to pay bribes 
and others robbed, so as to be allowed to cross the borders to 
return home. It is a right of every person who seeks asylum in 
another country to go back to his own country the moment he 
feels that his life is no longer threatened. The Tanzanian 
authorities therefore and the UNHCR should facilitate people who 
want to go back to their country, instead of leaving them to be 
killed by the very people they ran away from. The killing of 
the Tutsi in refugee camps in neighboring countries is a plan by 
the Hutu exteremists who through their radio RTLM 
[Radio-Television Libre Des Milles Collines] call for the 
extermination of the Tutsi and Hima [Tutsi clan] people in the 
region. The authorities in refugee camps in Tanzania and 
Burundi should crack down on these gangs of militias, apprehend 
them, and bring to justice the criminals.

  [Excerpts] Joseph Kengo Wa Dondo was appointed prime 
minister of Zaire yesterday, an appointment that was immediately 
disputed by the opposition--or at least that part of the 
opposition that still supports Etienne Tshisekedi. [passage 
omitted] 
  The opposition did not take part in the appointment of the 
new prime minister. Monsignor Monsengwo, chairman of the High 
Council of the Republic--Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT], was 
in Europe at the time. Herve de Guelink in Brussels asked him 
to comment after this decision: 
  [Begin Monsengwo recording] Adopting a position like this, 
in 
fact, falls within the competence of the High Court of Justice, 
and not of the Presidency of the HCR-PT. We refuse to give it 
our backing. The event you have referred to is the kind of 
thing that drives certain persons into illegal acts and illegal 
procedures. So we warned everyone against actions that might 
compromise the social peace. 
  We did not take any liberties since we were not involved in 
this action. We were both abroad, so what has happened has 
happened. The legality or constitutionality of the proceeding is 
a matter for the Supreme Court, and not for the chairman of the 
High Council of the Republic. [end recording]

  [Text] Yusuf Jama Burale, the Somaliland minister of 
resettlement and reconstruction, has briefed a Radio Hargeysa 
reporter on his ministry's work. The minister reported in 
general on the tasks and plans of the ministry, most of which 
have not been realized due to relations with the international 
community, which need to be set straight. The government is 
arguing that the international community should contact the 
government directly about activities in Somaliland. The 
minister went on to say that the plans include action on 
reconstruction and resettlement affairs in the country and ways 
of repatriating refugees. He said these things would be 
stressed. 
  On refugees from Somaliland in neighboring countries, Mr. 
Burale said that discussions have been held in the last eight 
months with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] and 
host countries on the most appropriate way of repatriating them. 
The minister said the government has told the UNHCR how the 
refugees should be repatriated and has explained the plan for 
preparations for resettling them before their arrival in the 
country. The government has requested that the basic 
necessities should be made available for resettling the refugees.

<F P=106> [Address by President Nelson Mandela in Soweto on 16 June; </F>
issued on the SAPA PR Wire Service] 
  [Text] Master of ceremonies, honourable ministers of the 
government of national unity, honourable provincial premiers and 
cabinet members, leaders of political parties, leaders of the 
various youth organisations, comrades, and friends: 
  When the tragic events of 16 June 1976 erupted in Soweto, 
the 
question posed itself to the whole of South Africa: So whereto 
now? 
  In the sacrifices that were borne by Hector Peterson and 
many 
other young people, there seemed to lie an answer. That the 
destiny of the youth was the grave and the hangman's noose, 
detention and long terms of imprisonment, exile and banishment. 
  That is what those who arrogated to themselves the status of 
slave-master sought to achieve. In the false comfort of their 
ill-gotten power, they convinced themselves that the answer to 
South Africa's problems was to murder, to maim and to persecute. 
  But they had typically closed their eyes to the historical 
truth that it is a God-given right that the slave should revolt. 
To the question, so whereto now, the answer of the youth and 
people of South Africa was: to battle, to struggle, to more 
bravery. 
  Today, we mark the 18th anniversary of June 16th as a free 
people, proud and full of joy for taking the resistance of that 
generation and others before and after it to its final 
conclusion. 
  Yet we mark this day also with a feeling of sadness: that 
the 
thousands who deserve to be here with us today are no more. We 
salute them all. 
  We commemorate this day, not with the song of defiance on 
our 
lips. This is no longer a day of protest by an excluded 
majority. 
  We have elected a government of our choice, at the head of 
which is the African National Congress. 
  The brave young people of that generation are today eminent 
premiers, ministers and members of national and provincial 
parliaments. They are taking their rightful place in the ranks 
of the new South African National Defence Force and other 
institutions of state and civil society. 
  Our presence together here--as representatives of the 
government of national unity, various political parties, youth 
organisations and structures of workers and 
communities--symbolises the fact that this is truly a national 
day. 
  The government is reviewing all South Africa's holidays, to 
ensure that our calendar is reflective of the total experience 
of all the people. And to us it is patently clear what the 
mandate is from this gathering and many others throughout the 
country. With regard to today, in particular, we urge that 
employers honour agreements with workers regarding June 16th as 
a paid holiday. 
  But we would be misrepresenting the sentiments of the class 
of '76 if our only concern was that this day should be declared 
a national holiday. 
  Rather, we should first and foremost, approach it from the 
point of view that the heroes of those struggles had a noble 
mission. They were inspired by a thirst for knowledge: knowledge 
which knows no colour; knowledge acquired through persuasion and 
hard work; knowledge that taps talents and releases creative 
energies; and knowledge that puts South African youth on par 
with the best in the world. 
  As we enter the new and glorious epoch that June 16th helped 
to usher in, we will do well to emulate that heroism and turn it 
into an asset for the tasks that lie ahead. 
  We have achieved our freedom. But formal liberation will be 
an empty shell if we do not immediately start addressing the 
social conditions bred by apartheid. The Reconstruction and 
Development Programme must be implemented without delay. 
  It is therefore fitting that youth organisations of various 
persuasions have adopted the theme: youth united for 
reconciliation, education and development - as an embodiment of 
the spirit of this commemoration. We also acknowledge the 
presence in our midst of eminent representatives of the United 
Nations International Children's Education Fund; and express our 
confidence that your presence in our country will, in more ways 
than one, assist our programmes to improve the conditions of our 
youth. 
  The government is convinced that among the first challenges 
that we need to address in this regard is to inculcate the 
culture of learning and teaching in all schools. 
  No matter what the origins of the profound education crisis 
might be, the fact is that this has become our collective 
heritage. We are no longer petitioners, exerting pressure from 
the sidelines. We have to roll up our sleeves and together 
tackle the problems. 
  I am personally encouraged by reports of a return to 
normality in the schools, since the elections. This does show 
the commitment on the part of teachers and students to expend 
their energies in ensuring that we truly become masters of our 
own destiny. 
  The problems wrought by apartheid education have lately been 
compounded by such terrible tendencies as the proliferation of 
criminal gangs, weapons and drugs in some of our schools. This 
cannot be allowed to continue. All-round discipline, within an 
education strategy involving all players, is fundamental to the 
solution of these problems. 
  In order to address the root causes of the education crisis, 
we intend to table a bill in Parliament soon, to eradicate 
discrimination and take the first major steps towards ten years 
of free quality education. 
  For these changes to be effective, there has to be close co- 
operation between government and organisations of teachers, 
students, parents, workers and the business community. The task 
to make South Africa a learning and learned nation belongs to 
all of us. 
  The culture of teaching and learning means also that there 
should be a culture of rights in the schools. Teachers deserve 
to be treated with respect by students, society and government. 
In turn, they will enjoy such respect if they act responsibly, 
appreciating the central position that their fraternity occupies 
in society. 
  With regard to this year in particular, we fully support the 
initiatives to make up for the time lost during recent national 
events. We hope that the intensive learning effort will 
constitute the beginning of a nation-wide and continuing 
campaign. 
  The opening of doors to the world offers more than just new 
opportunities for the youth. It is also a great challenge for 
us to improve our standards to match those of other nations. 
  I wish to use this opportunity to send out an invitation to 
the youth of our country to be a full part of the exciting 
transformation that we are engaged in. The government is 
involved in discussions with different youth organisations on 
how they can best make their contribution to the nation-building 
and development effort. 
  During the address at the opening of the last session of 
Parliament, we announced the decision to establish a national 
youth commission. We have now gone a step further and 
established a cabinet committee on youth under the supervision 
of minister of sport and recreation. We further wish to welcome 
the progress being made by the youth formations towards the 
setting up of a youth parliament in the form of the national 
youth council. 
  In these endeavours, political youth organisations in 
particular need to address the problem of their functioning 
simply as duplicates of their mother bodies. Needless to say, 
what is needed are creative programmes which promote the 
interests of all youth and involve African, coloured, indian and 
white youth in so far as government is concerned, the aim is not 
to attend to the youth as if you were some separate and special 
species from outer space. Our central approach is to ensure 
that young people are fully integrated into the social, economic 
and political life of society. 
  Our policies must turn into reality the principle that every 
child deserves to have a decent home and be brought up in the 
loving care of a family. The terrible legacy of street children 
has to be attended to with urgency. A collective effort has to 
be launched by the government, civil society and the private 
sector to ensure that every child is looked after, has 
sufficient nutrition and health care. The government has 
already started taking steps in this regard. 
  We have, further, taken steps to ensure that within the 
shortest possible time, we empty our jails of children. The 
process of finding alternative centres for them is under way. 
  Personally, I regard this as an urgent priority. In a humble 
attempt to contribute to this effort, I am consulting with 
relevant individuals and bodies, for me to set up a presidential 
trust fund representative of people beyond the ANC and the mass 
democratic movement, to specifically deal with the problems of 
street children and detainees. I intend to make a contribution 
of R150,000 [rand] a year to this fund - irrespective of the 
decision that Parliament will make about the salaries of elected 
representatives. Further details will be announced in due 
course. 
  The fund I have referred to will assist in alleviating these 
problems. But I do recognise, as all of you do, that a lasting 
solution lies in comprehensive socio-economic upliftment 
programmes. At the same time, the youth, especially from 
disadvantaged communities, need to realise that we cannot rely 
only on governmental programmes and charity. We also have to 
take initiatives in our communities to pool our meagre resources 
for projects such as bursaries and skills upgrading. 
  One of the most important problems facing the youth and 
society is the AIDS epidemic. We can no longer afford to hide 
behind tradition and embarrassment, pretending that this problem 
does not exist. To do so is to consign our nation to certain 
disaster. We need to join hands now to ensure that the 
campaigns launched make the maximum impact. 
  It serves no purpose to continue blaming the past for these 
problems, including drug trafficking, gangsterism and violence. 
We must all take responsibility by tackling the root causes at 
the same time as we ensure effective law-enforcement. 
  The security forces, working hand-in-hand with communities, 
have an enormous role to play in this regard. 
  The responsibility of maintaining public safety and security 
is not one of the police alone. The people more especially the 
youth should take an active part in the police-community forums 
that are being set up across the country. And, together, we 
must transform the institutions of security to become servants 
of the people. 
  For this reason, we should all condemn in the strongest 
terms 
the shooting and killing of policemen and women. 
  In addition, our communities cannot allow a situation in 
which young men and women continue to harass communities and 
butcher one another in the name of community self-defence. 
  We are convinced that there are many cadres of integrity in 
self- defence units who have played a crucial role in times of 
need. But the true measure of their integrity has been 
displayed in their co- operation with community structures to 
implement a programme that will see to their return to school, 
integration within the security forces or participation in 
skills-upgrading. Those who defy these programmes cannot 
justifiably claim to act on behalf of the community or expect 
community protection for their evil deeds. 
  I call on all youth to join us in the effort to build peace 
and reconciliation in our land. 
  The government of national unity is on course and all the 
participating organisations are co-operating well. As 
demonstrated at the OAU summit from which we have just returned, 
we are, as a nation, making a tremendous impact on the continent 
and the entire world. 
  The manner in which the youth co-ordinating structures have 
organised this event is a clear statement to the nation and the 
world, that the youth is committed to the healing of the wounds 
of the past. 
  With you, we say to all South Africa's youth, black and 
white, including those in the army and police: June 16th is 
your day. You might have been on the other side of the dividing 
line of apartheid. But now is the time to join the majority in 
building a new and glorious future for our country and all its 
people. 
  There is nothing to fear from democracy. The African 
National Congress seeks no retribution. Our message of 
reconciliation is inspired by a genuine love for our country. 
When we call for the truth we do so in order to ensure that all 
of us come to terms with the past. So that we can bury those 
evil experiences secure in the knowledge that future generations 
will recoil from any temptation to repeat them. 
  Let us all rise to the challenge of the freedom that we have 
won. That challenge is to create a better life for all South 
Africans: to create jobs, to provide free quality education and 
open up opportunities for skills training, to build houses, to 
provide health facilities and other basic services. 
  Let us together answer the question, so whereto now, with a 
new youthful determination to learn, to build and to live life 
to the full. The country thirsts for your talents and energy. 
  Together, let us get South Africa working! Thank you.

  [Text] Early reports on the movement of public transport 
indicate that workers in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] Province and in the Durban area are not staying 
away on a large scale to celebrate 16 June. Buses and trains 
are running normally and carrying the normal number of 
passengers. The government decided yesterday not to declare 
today an official public holiday despite trade union insistence. 
The South African Chamber of Business welcomed the announcement 
but asked that the employers be flexible towards workers wanting 
the day off.

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister Without Portfolio Jay Naidoo by </F>
Shaun Johnson and Kaizer Nyatsumba] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  On being Minister Without Portfolio. </H5>
  The RDP [Reconstruction and Development Programme] had to be 
driven by the president, to be made a major flagship of the GNU 
[Government of National Unity]. The president had to be 
assisted by someone of ministerial status to ensure the 
programme was implemented -- that's what I wanted to do. 
<H5>  On the Reconstruction and Development Programme. </H5>
  The RDP is an integrated and coherent growth and 
developmental strategy that spans different ministries. My 
function is really to be the back-up for the president in terms 
of making sure that the goals of the RDP are implemented. 
<H5>  On the RDP and the Cabinet. </H5>
  You have a government that has accepted the RDP -- all 
parties in the GNU. We are in the process of finalising an RDP 
Special Committee of Cabinet, which will look at how to ensure 
that we build co-operation in an integrated way. 
<H5>  On the RDP as an ANC policy. </H5>
  The RDP is a programme. The document as it developed is not 
a Bible. What the ANC agreed was a framework: a million houses 
over five years; two-and-a-half million jobs through a public 
works programme; 10 years of basic, high-quality education; and 
so on. The Government has adopted that. 
<H5>  On Inputs to the RDP. </H5>
  We are looking at inputs from all government departments, 
parastatals, State institutions, provincial and local 
government, civil society, the private sector, trade union 
movement, etcetera. That process has now started. 
<H5>  On whether he is the RDP's `policeman'. </H5>
  I never wanted to be a policeman in my life, and the way I 
approach my work is that whether you are a National Party person 
or IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] person or ANC, you have been 
elected, so that you deliver the goods and services to the 
people. The only coherent vehicle through which you can deliver 
goods and services is the RDP. 
<H5>  On the RDP and the rest of government. </H5>
  The RDP is not just something located in this office, in 
isolation from what is going on in the rest of Government. Take 
the RDP fund. It has two objectives. One is to leverage within 
government departments the ability of those departments to 
allocate resources to new priorities, and the second is to 
kick-start an RDP programme. Ministers must start defining a 
five-year strategy linked to RDP priorities. I work with a 
number of key Ministers who present on a regular basis reports 
to Cabinet that measure the goals we have set. 
<H5>  On provincial involvement. </H5>
  I am in regular contact with all the premiers. There are 
meetings that I attend with the regional premiers that involve 
provincial affairs and local government, together with Public 
Administration and with Finance (Ministers). The core of the 
RDP is driven by a very tight working together of (the 
ministries of) Public Administration, Finance and State 
Expenditure, the RDP office here and Provincial and Local 
Government Affairs. We include as well the Public Works 
Minister. 
<H5>  On longer-term change. </H5>
  In terms of infrastructural programmes, that requires more 
time (than the 100-day programme). You can't make an ad hoc 
decision about whether you start at Orange Farm or at Tokoza. 
We are ready to put into place a major project and are sitting 
down with local government MECs [member executive council] to 
try and work out some programme. Not all provinces have the 
same priorities. 
<H5>  On whether regular RDP updates will be issued. </H5>
  Absolutely. Part of our duties is communication strategy. I 
am very keen (to see) that there is a public way in which the 
RDP gets assessed. 
<H5>  On the cost of implementing the RDP. </H5>
  People did not understand how we approached this issue. When 
we (the ANC) talked about funding the RDP, remember, we argued 
consistently that the major source of funding must come from the 
way you reorganise government expenditure towards new 
priorities. We are wanting to get away from the idea of the RDP 
being an add-on programme. 
<H5>  On others' role in implementing the RDP: </H5>
  The RDP is not just a Government programme. When it is 
driven by people and centred around people's needs, it will 
succeed. Government needs to build a genuine partnership with 
the trade union movement, organised business, civic movements, 
rural-based movements, women's movements, etc. 
<H5>  On private sector involvement in the RDP. </H5>
  I think we have achieved a great deal of (consensus) that 
the 
RDP represents a coherent and stable strategy towards rebuilding 
the country. The next issue is to put your money where your 
mouth is. The one important area is to get private sector 
investment in the economy. Because the following investment is 
going to come in from overseas (only once) private sector 
investment is coming from South Africa. It really needs to be 
brought to the public's awareness. There is potential for a 
major housing boom, linked to infrastructural development, and 
the private sector really needs to get involved. 
<H5>  On his new lifestyle and position as Cabinet Minister. </H5>
  My current lifestyle is very much like my old lifestyle. I 
spend my time meeting with trade union representatives, civil 
organisations, the different Ministers, etcetera, around issues 
which have always interested me -- developmental issues. In a 
sense it has been quite a smooth transition from running Cosatu 
[Congress of South African Trade Unions], where my major role 
was co-ordination and development programmes, to being involved 
in reconstruction programmes. 
<H5>  On sitting in the Union Buildings. </H5>
  How do I feel about sitting in the Union Building? I feel 
phenomenal. It is an amazing feeling to sit here and think that 
not so long ago there used to be a government that plotted 
against us. It's a really ironic twist of fate. It's an amazing 
feeling that we can now actually do things that Government needs 
to do, and in a way that is democratic. 
<H5>  On his personal relationships with De Klerk and Keys. </H5>
  Obviously my relationship with the Deputy President (De 
Klerk) in the past has been a turbulent one. We were 
protagonists in a battle where we sought to establish democracy. 
But we fought an election and we have agreed on a GNU. And we 
have agreed now on the RDP. At a personal level, I never hold 
grudges against anyone. In fact, among the people I respect 
most are those that have been among my foes. In terms of Derek 
Keys, I never locked horns with him; I locked horns with his 
predecessor (Barend du Plessis).

<F P=106> [Report by Adrian Hadland] </F>
  [Text] Parastatal companies had a special role to play in 
government's reconstruction and development programme and would 
not be privatised, Public Enterprises Minister Stella Sigcau 
said yesterday. As providers of vital foreign exchange and 
suitable conduits for the implementation of affirmative action 
initiatives, parastatal groups falling under Sigcau's 
ministerial ambit, such as Denel, Eskom [Electricity Supply 
Commission], Transnet [Transportation Network] and Safcol 
[expansion unknown] would be commercialised but not sold to the 
private sector. 
  This was a change from the former government's policy which 
was to commercialise public enterprises with a view to eventual 
privatisation, she said in Pretoria. "While we have 
appreciation and understanding for the role of privatisation in 
the more sophisticated economies, we remain justifiably wary of 
privatisation along similar lines in SA's unique context." 
  Privatisation could lead to share ownership being 
transferred 
to "an exclusive group" without granting the nation as a whole 
the opportunity to benefit from the process. For the moment, 
the emphasis would be on commercialisation as well as ensuring 
transparency and accountability in the governing of public 
enterprises. 
  While affirmative action programmes had already been 
instituted in the parastatals, Sigcau said she would be taking a 
keen interest in how these were developed, particularly with 
regard to women. 
  Eskom's objective was to achieve a "fundamental shift" in 
its 
race and gender profile by the year 2000. Until December 1996, 
Eskom's recruitment of employees, bursars and trainees would 
give preference to black South Africans. 
  Transnet's Turn Strategy, which had been in operation for 
two 
years, had similar aims and objectives. 
  Denel had committed itself to training 500 technicians, 200 
computer programmers and had agreed that 30 percent of its 
management would be from under-represented groups within three 
years. 
  Sigcau said affirmative action programmes would have to be 
sensitive to the aspirations of non-black staff. "There will 
still be promotions of white South Africans and no white 
employee will lose his job because of affirmative action." But 
she warned that while every effort would be made to implement 
affirmative action in a sympathetic way "no one will be allowed 
to frustrate its objectives." 
  Sigcau also said government's policy on acquisitions would 
prevent, "if at all practicable", the continuing concentration 
of markets. Competition policy would emphasise the "protection 
of competition, rather than of the competitors."

  [Text] Johannesburg June 15 SAPA -- The National Economic 
Forum [NEF] is likely to become a statutory body, continuing to 
advise government on economic policy and its implementation, 
senior NEF officials said Wednesday [15 June] in Johannesburg. 
NEF labour convenor Jayendra Naidoo told a media briefing a 
final report on the co-operative business, government and labour 
body would be made next month. 
  However, he said key conclusions of the report suggested the 
NEF become a statutory body funded with public money. 
  The report, by a task force formed in February, also urged 
the merging of the NEF with the National Manpower Commission to 
enhance the tripartite role of the current forum in economic 
matters. 
  "Tripartism has a role to play in formulating and 
implementing economic policy," Mr Naidoo said, "it has proved to 
be very useful." 
  NEF government convenor Japie Jacobs, also special advisor 
to 
the finance minister, said the NEF would have to be re-focussed 
but was still a vital body. "I can't see us governing the 
country economically without a body like the nef," he told 
reporters. 
  NEF business convenor Bobby Godsell also expressed his 
support for the body's role, saying it was "an instrument for 
government to govern with civil society".

<F P=106> [Interview with Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Pik </F>
Botha by announcer Jeremy Dawes in the Johannesburg studio; date 
not given; from the "Radio Today" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] As you are no doubt aware, the price of petrol is to 
go up by 8 cents a liter from a minute past midnight tomorrow 
night. Earlier, we spoke to the mineral and energy affairs 
minister, Pik Botha, who assured us that the government has done 
everything in its power to avoid the inevitable. 
  [Begin recording] [Botha] Actually, the increase should have 
been 14 cents per liter, but because of the government's 
sensitivity for the consumer and the problem this will cause, we 
for weeks worked with the National Economic Forum and the Liquid 
Industry Fuels Task Force to achieve this. I am very sorry this 
is the case, but it's like the weather--you have no control over 
it. I trust that our public will understand this. 
  [Dawes] Some of the biggest fuel users or petrol users are 
the taxi operators. Is government promoting the use of diesel 
motor power by taxi operators to minimize fuel usage? 
  [Botha] Well, this matter, together with a lot of the 
fundamental issues surrounding the fuel industry in this 
country, will now be thoroughly investigated and examined by the 
government in conjunction with and with the assistance of the 
National Economic Forum and the Liquid Fuels Industry Task 
Force, and I trust that within weeks we will come up, hopefully, 
with a new mechanism for determining the petrol price. 
Secondly, to look at precisely, aspects like the one you 
mentioned. 
  I am not this morning in a position offhand to say whether 
that is feasible, but certainly we are sympathetic--more than 
sympathetic to the problems of the taxi industry. They are 
carrying almost half, if not more than half, of all passengers 
in this country. They are the single largest user and consumer 
of petrol, and anything that can alleviate their position we 
will support. 
  [Dawes] Mr. Botha, the Automobile Association is in favor of 
deregulation of the whole system. How do you feel about this? 
  [Botha] I am open-minded. I am open-minded, and I am 
prepared to recommend any system that will...that will make 
petrol less expensive for our people, for our consumers, but 
then it must be thoroughly investigated so that it is not a 
temporary...not a temporary, interim reduction that is brought 
about, but that, in the long term, the interest of all the 
parties involved are served. There are 28,000 pump attendants 
spread out through this country. I want to know: Will they lose 
their jobs? If there is what they call, you know, vertical 
integration. I want to know: What about the small operator, far 
away from the major urban areas? Will he survive? We need 
small businesses. Small businesses are the entities that employ 
people and resolve your employment problem, unemployment 
problems, so it is a complicated issue but of course we are 
sympathetic to any suggestion that takes into account a balance 
of interest. [end recording]

  [Text] Pretoria June 15 SAPA -- Iscor [South African Iron 
and Steel Corporation] said on Wednesday [15 June] it was 
entering the titanium and heavy metals industry by acquiring 100 
per cent of the shares and claims in Natal Mineral Sands from 
Shell (South Africa) and Rhoex. 
  Subject to certain conditions, the effective date of the 
transaction would be July 1. 
  The acquisition involves two quality mineral sands resources 
which are located in Natal and Transkei. 
  By taking over Natal minerals sands and the interests of 
Rhoex in Wavecrest (Transkei), Iscor has acquired most of the 
remaining South African titanium reserves with low 
radio-activity levels. 
  "This significant resource of high grade chlorinatable 
feedstock, low in radio activity, will enable Iscor to enter 
this industry," Ben Alberts, Iscor's executive director, mining, 
said. 
  "We are one of the South African organisations with the 
technical know-how, infrasrtucture and ability to develop the 
required smelting technology. We have already done a number of 
successful smelting trials with the mineral." 
  The take over of Natal mineral sands follows on the 
announcements earlier this year that Iscor had successfully 
tendered for coal exploration rights near the town of Moranbah 
in Queensland, Australia and its investment in the Qingdao port 
complex in the People's Republic of China to secure a dedicated 
iron ore storage facility.

  [Text] South Africa's ambassador to the United States, Mr. 
Harry Schwarz, says that although weapons sanctions have been 
lifted there are still restrictions on the weapons trade with 
Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South Africa] and Denel. 
Speaking in a radio interview he said that this was because 
American legislation did not allow American companies to trade 
with companies which had been blacklisted. He said that the two 
South African companies have still not been removed from the 
weapons blacklist despite the lifting of sanctions. Mr. Schwarz 
confirmed that a number of South Africans had been arrested for 
drug smuggling in various American cities and were awaiting 
trial. It's believed that the suspects were acting as couriers 
in the United States and Europe for African drug smugglers.

  [Text] Pretoria June 15 SAPA -- The cabinet committee 
appointed to investigate the controversial transfer of three 
million hectares of KwaZulu land into the trusteeship of King 
Goodwill Zwelithini has recommended he continue as guardian of 
the land. The report of the committee, chaired by Land Affairs 
Minister Derek Hanekom, was submittted to cabinet on Wednesday 
[15 June]. 
  On April 25, two days before the election, the then State 
President F W de Klerk assented to the transfer of the land to 
the trustee of the Ingonyama [King's] Trust, King Goodwill. 
  The transfer, made in terms of the KwaZulu Ingonyama Trust 
Act of 1994, caused an outcry when it was made public after the 
elections, and the cabinet on May 23 appointed a committee to 
investigate the act. 
  Mr Hanekom said in a statement on Wednesday there was 
sufficient common ground between the relevant parties to arrive 
at an acceptable solution and to secure an appropriate role for 
the Zulu king as guardian of the tribal land. 
  The committee found the goals for the establishment of the 
trust were to ensure that land occupied or owned by tribes in 
the affected area would vest in them when the new constitution 
came into effect. 
  "The intention was to create a mechanism to preserve tribal 
interests in the land, within the present framework of 
traditional authority structures. There was no intention to give 
the trust the powers of government. 
  "The act does not make the ingonyama the owner of the land 
in 
the sense that it is his personal property -- he holds the land 
as statutory trustee, subject to existing rights of people," Mr 
Hanekom said. 
  Furthermore, most of the land was already occupied by tribes 
and communities since before 1913 and the act would have limited 
impact on land redistribution and restitution. 
  "However, the act results in an unusual mixture of public 
and 
private law powers and functions. This complicates its 
interpretation and application, resulting in uncertainty and 
administrative problems." 
  The committee recommended the act be amended or substituted 
so that the ingonyama continued his guardianship of the land, 
with his powers and functions described. 
  The act should address issues dealing with alienation of 
land 
and resolution of tribal border disputes, and should govern all 
tribally-owned land falling within the former territory of 
KwaZulu, subject to the existing rights of occupants of that 
land. 
  "Legislation should create a structure for managing the land 
which is sufficiently broadly-based to ensure any unwarranted 
interference by any person or body, or manipulation of the land 
is not possible. This is done to allay any fears of possible 
illicit interference or manipulation," Mr Hanekom said. 
  Legislation to give effect to this decision should be the 
subject of consultation between the national government and the 
provincial government."All parties should agree and undertake 
not to take any action which might pre-empt the implementation 
of this decision." 
  Mr Hanekom said he wished to assure the South African public 
that the cabinet committee, operating within a tight deadline, 
had taken its task "very seriously indeed". All facts and 
implications were taken into account in formulating the 
recommendations to cabinet, he said.

  [Text] Deputy President Thabo Mbeki says the Volkstaat 
[homeland] Council is ultimately responsible for negotiations 
for a volkstaat and self-determination for the Afrikaner. 
  Mr. Mbeki was speaking at the swearing-in of the 20 members 
of the council in Pretoria this morning. Addressing the members 
at the Old Raadsaal at Church Square, he said a volkstaat and 
self-determination should be given attention under the 
guidelines of a democratic South Africa. He commended the 
leader of the Freedom Front, General Constand Viljoen, for 
drawing right-wing Afrikaners towards the constitutional process. 
  General Viljoen said the changes that had taken place in 
South Africa were only the first step. He said it was in the 
interests of the country that the needs of the Afrikaner were 
rapidly identified. General Viljoen said Afrikaners would have 
to realize that they would not be able to live totally separate 
from the country because South Africa had an integrated economy. 
  Mr. Johann Wingaard was elected chairman of the Volkstaat 
Council.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Z.B. du Toit] </F>
  [Excerpt] Amidst criticism from his own ranks, President 
Mandela this week renewed his commitment to negotiations with 
the right wing over a white homeland. His idea is to give the 
right wing enough time to realize that an independent state for 
Afrikaners is unattainable, writes Z.B. du Toit. 
  Proponents of a separate state for Afrikaners achieved some 
measure of success this week when the Volkstaatraad [homeland 
council], whose task it is to formulate a plan for such a state 
according to the constitution, met for the first time. This 
happened amid growing suspicions that right-wingers are the 
target of a long and well-planned maneuver by President Mandela 
to do away with the idea of a volkstaat as well as to defuse the 
threat of right-wing politics. 
  The essence of this is that President Mandela wants 
right-wingers to come to the realization that the establishment 
of a white homeland is an impossible task, or at least to show 
them that the idea is so unfeasible that they will abandon it. 
For a while now, the ANC has apparently carefully been trying 
not to show its strong opposition to an ethnic home for 
Afrikaners, with the knowledge that the current delicate 
constitutional process should not be exposed to the threat of 
disruptive action by right-wingers. 
<H5>  No Feasible Plan </H5>
  What has led to the ANC finally accommodating the right wing 
is the absence thus far of any practical plan for a homeland. 
All the major right-wing political parties, primarily 
established to promote apartheid, were until recently strongly 
opposed to an independent state for Afrikaners. With its 
strategy of accommodating the right wing the ANC will also be 
able to gain the advantage because of the strong differences in 
opinion among those in favor of a homeland. Some are emotionally 
committed to a homeland somewhere in the Transvaal and the 
Orange Free State, while others are dogmatic in their attempts 
to establish one in the northwestern Cape. 
  During negotiations Mr. Mandela and the ANC threw the ball 
neatly into the court of the right wing with their invitation: 
Draw up a plan, put it on the table and let us take a look at 
it. The ANC must realize that any expert investigation into a 
homeland in the north will have to bow down to the harsh reality 
of an overwhelming majority of blacks in the region, and 
Afrikaners totally dependent on an economy dominated by black 
labor. An Afrikaans state in the region will lead to either the 
large-scale movement of people or disenfranchisement, the two 
biggest sins of apartheid. This is of course not practical. 
<H5>  Rejected </H5>
  If the Volkstaatraad had to approach the Constitutional 
Assembly with such a plan, it would immediately be rejected. 
The ANC knows it will have world support when it does this. 
The only remaining option is that a relatively uninhabited 
region of the country be selected in which Afrikaners can 
resettle themselves over a long period so that a white majority 
can be assured and a new country established. 
  If President Mandela wants to do something practical about 
his accommodation politics then he could even suggest that such 
an area, for example Northwestern Cape, be cordoned off 
temporarily as a possible future Afrikaner state. This would 
present a challenge to the far-right to develop the area, 
including setting up basic services which forms part of any new 
state; however, will Afrikaners be able to do this? 
  The impression is created that President Mandela wants to 
find out now if Afrikaners really are in favor of a homeland, if 
one takes into account his reference to a referendum among 
Afrikaners to test support for a white homeland. It is also 
possible that he will wait for the first concrete proposals on 
the homeland to be presented so that all Afrikaners are aware of 
its content, because the ANC apparently reasons that large-scale 
uprooting will be necessary and will not exactly be 
enthusiastically received among the majority of Afrikaners.

  [Text] The HNP's [Reformed National Party] special congress 
on 31 May was held to prepare the party for the new phase in the 
struggle for Afrikaner nationalism. The congress was held in 
the Silverton City Hall and delegates and other members of the 
party turned up in large numbers from all over the country and 
packed the hall for the proceedings. The decision to hold the 
congress on a historic day such as 31 May [Republic Day] met 
with great approval among party members. 
  After leader Jaap Marais's inspiring speech on political 
strategies, party members could again look forward to the 
difficult but exciting road that lies ahead in the future of the 
HNP. Party members once more came to realize that the HNP was 
the only party which had the leader and the commitment to lead 
the Afrikaner people in the dark days ahead. 
  The rest of the day's activities were based on possible 
changes to the HNP's program of principles, the constitution, 
and the party's authority structures in the light of the 
struggle ahead. Changes have been proposed to improve the HNP's 
effectiveness in the changing times in which the De Klerk 
government has plunged us. This will put the HNP in a position 
to oppose the government, as should be the case in a democratic 
order. 
  The HNP is to take the lead in the spirit of resistance and 
opposition against the humiliation and defamation of the 
Afrikaner nation and its language. On the basis of nationalism, 
emphasis in HNP policy will fall strongly on each nation's 
preference for that which is its own. 
  There was a general feeling in the audience that it was only 
a matter of time before HNP policy and principles were regarded 
as the only ones capable of resolving the South African 
situation. Through the funds that have been collected by 
workers in the party, especially in parts of the Cape province, 
it can be deduced that throughout the country the Afrikaner 
nation hungers for truth, and that Afrikaners are once again 
rallying to support the HNP in its struggle against enemies of 
the Afrikaner nation.

  [Excerpts] The HNP's [Reformed National Party] special 
congress rewrote parts of its program of principles to expand on 
previous ideas so that they fit into the current political 
climate. However, not a single principle has been compromised or 
watered down. The amendments were accepted unanimously. 
[passage omitted] 
  Article 3, which deals with the party's objectives, says: As 
a political national front of Afrikanerdom, the party encourages 
the Afrikaner nation to uphold and adhere to -- in politics and 
in other spheres of the nation's existence -- the following 
principles in the Republic of South Africa. 
  On national identity, the right-wing again reaffirms its 
view: "Since it pleased God to create different peoples and 
nations: 

  -  The national identity of the Afrikaner nation and that of 
the other nations in South Africa must be preserved; 
  -  The Afrikaner nation must be bound to its culture; 
  -  The general development of the nation's life must be along 
Christian-national norms, and 
  -  The anti-Christian and antinational pursuit of cultural 
uniformity, ethnic mixing, and the preparation of a world state 
must at all times be opposed, so that the Creator will be 
glorified by a variety of national cultures. 


    The article on population politics has been rewritten as 
follows: 

  -  The HNP's foundation is nationalism. It is based on 
preference for what is your own, a universal right of persons 
and groups. 
  -  Society in South Africa is not one single community, but a 
diversity of communities which differ in race, culture, 
language, and religion. To try to integrate these communities 
into a single nation by means of a general franchise under a 
central authority is unacceptable in the light of the right to 
continued existence and self-determination of the different 
communities. 


    As condition for the upholding of a peaceful order of 
organic 
homogeneousness, and the success of a policy of peaceful 
neighborliness, opposition to mixing and to the elimination of 
national boundaries must be maintained through the upholding of 
separate identities. 
  History -- including that of Africa since the 1960's -- is 
full of failed attempts to accommodate divergent groups in one 
parliamentary democracy. History has confirmed that a 
parliamentary democracy has limited tolerance for racial and 
religious differences. So, too, does the history of the Soviet 
Union and the countries of Central Europe in the 90's indicate 
that cultural, religious, and historical differences are 
destructive in democratically integrated states. 
  Afrikaners and English speakers: Since the Afrikaner not 
only makes up the oldest part of the white population, but is 
also the only white nation born in this country, and since the 
Afrikaner, due to his homogeneousness is not able to receive any 
direct reinforcements from outside, the authorities must see to 
it that the Afrikaans language, culture, and way of life are 
upheld and promoted at all times, so that the national and 
cultural identity of Afrikanerdom is preserved untarnished -- an 
Afrikanerdom which also includes those English speakers and 
other language groups who identify with the historical roots and 
the history of the Afrikaner people. 
  Language: The party recognizes Afrikaans as an indigenous 
language of Africa, as the name indicates, but also a cultural 
language that distinguishes itself from other indigenous 
languages. It is the language in which the struggle for freedom 
against British domination was conducted, and in which great 
political and economic development took place. It is also the 
language that has stamped not only thousands of farms and 
numerous towns and cities in the country, but also the fishes 
and rivers, trees and mountains, birds and other animals of the 
country. This gives the Afrikaans language an inalienable, 
unique right in the country over other languages that are not 
indigenous. 
  The party concedes that English is an international 
language, 
and also that it is the language of a considerable section of 
South Africa's population, and is therefore regarded as a useful 
communication medium. 
  The congress used words such as "race" where applicable in 
its program of principles. 
  Agriculture was specifically singled out for a lot of 
attention. The existence and welfare of the rural population has 
to be seen as very important. The preservation and the increase 
of independent and self-sufficient land owners must be promoted. 
The stifling of the individual farmer by any person or interest 
group who is in a position of power and influence by being in 
control of big capital, must be fought. 
  The HNP's policy on the protection of white land ownership 
and of the farmer's full control over marketing his own 
products, as opposed to the capitalist interests which control 
the "middleman," are also contained in the program. The HNP 
also says there has to be a policy which positively encourages 
the birthrate among whites. White births have in the past been 
discouraged by the state. 
  Significant, too, is the policy to give spiritual and 
physical aid to the needy. Where such help cannot be provided, 
the state should intervene. The church must also play a big 
role in community affairs, as the HNP acknowledges the state's 
Christian commitments.

  [Text] Cape Town -- The ANC national working committee 
decided yesterday to go ahead with a major phased restructuring 
of the party aimed at gaining more effective party control over 
members in government. The committee also agreed to introduce, 
before next week's mini-session of Parliament, a type of 
constituency system to ensure MPs and senators were put to work 
effectively, ANC secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa said 
afterwards. 
  The committee, which met in Johannesburg, also set up a 
subcommittee to investigate the salary structures of MPs, 
senators and Ministers after complaints from ANC local and 
provincial structures that these salaries were too big. 
  Ramaphosa said the ANC's restructuring was aimed at 
"streamlining the party structures to ensure effective 
co-ordination between what happens in Parliament, in government 
and in the organisation". 
  He declined to disclose further details at this stage, 
except 
to say the restructuring would take place in stages. He 
described the plan as "historic and ground-breaking". The next 
stage would be for the ANC regions to discuss the proposal 
before it was debated again. 
  Ramaphosa said the salary sub-committee would analyse the 
report of the Melamet Committee on Remuneration of Politicians, 
which was released in April and led to the row within the ANC. 
The subcommittee would compare the salary structures under the 
previous government and the new ones. 
  The Melamet committee recommended that MPs earn a basic 
salary before tax of R193,200 [rand] while Ministers earn 
R470,400 before tax. 
  The ANC parliament caucus decided two weeks ago that MPs, 
senators, Deputy Ministers and Ministers would contribute 
between R750 and R2,000 a month to the party earning the ANC 
more than R260,000 a month. 
  ANC officials said earlier that they realised the danger of 
ordinary MPs not having much work to do and seemingly being left 
out in the cold on major decision-making. The more than 300 ANC 
MPs and senators would be expected to represent all voters in 
their area and not just their party's supporters. 
  The ANC constituencies -- the old system of constituencies 
fell away when negotiators agreed to implement proportional 
representation -- were expected to be broadly based on SA's 
magisterial boundaries.

  [Text] Bold plans to control violence and crime and to 
rebuild war-ravaged Reef townships were revealed by PWV 
[Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] safety and security chief 
Jessie Duarte yesterday. In a report to the standing committee 
for safety and security at Nasrec [National Exhibition Center] 
near Soweto, Duarte said the creation of peace and the 
rebuilding of communities on the East Rand were high on her list 
of priorities. 
  Other priorities included the establishment of community 
policing forums, car theft, rape, allegations of police torture, 
and gun control legislation. 
  Duarte said the improvement of working conditions for 
policemen and the upgrading of police stations were also 
"absolute necessities". 
  "Job satisfaction is certainly not the motivating factor for 
entering the SAPS [South African Police Service]. Rather, job 
necessity seems to be the factor motivating people." 
  She added that solving the problem of disillusionment, 
without looking at a programme of affirmative action for black 
police personnel in particular, was not possible. 
  Duarte said efforts to stabilise the East Rand had already 
begun, with the creation of an IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]-ANC 
working group to look at the opening of "no-go areas", the 
resumption of train services between Kwesini and Katlehong, and 
the security of residents returning to their homes. 
  She explained proposals to reorientate members of 
self-defence and self-protection units created to protect 
communities and hostels. Duarte said a programme, organised by 
the PWV MEC [member executive council] for education, had been 
established to enable members of the units between the ages of 
13 and 18 to attend six- month "reintegration school programmes" 
to prepare them for admission to ordinary schools. 
  Members between the ages of 19 and 24 would be put through 
adult literacy programmes and be assisted with job creation or 
entrance to tertiary institutions. 
  And older members would be assisted in joining the police 
force as reservists or organised into neighbourhood watch 
programmes. 
  Duarte said that according to the defence force about 20,000 
illegal weapons were in circulation on the East Rand and an 
amnesty or gun collection campaign would retrieve only about 10 
percent of the weapons. 
  One of the problems was community scepticism about the 
police 
force and the number of weapons illegally owned by criminals, 
said Duarte. 
  The "unprecedented" increase in rapes and violent crime 
against women had prompted the urgent need for members of the 
police force to be trained to deal with victims, said Duarte. 
  She also proposed the creation of a commission of inquiry to 
investigate police torture.

  [Text] The PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] 
police force will be completely revamped in the near future and 
will have elements of both the United States and British 
systems. The new force will come into operation after the 
promulgation of the Police Act, which is expected in August. 
Veronica van der Westhuizen reports: 
  The South African Police have long been seen as a 
controversial force in society. They are perceived as 
inefficient and corrupt, and are not trusted by the majority of 
the population. Today a number of recommendations were made at 
a special hearing to address these problems by the PWV's MEC 
[member of the executive council] for Public Safety and 
Security, Ms. Jessie Duarte. The suggestions included the 
control of the traffic department by the national ministry. It 
was recommended that drug trafficking and gun running be dealt 
with by the National Investigation Service [NIS]. The NIS would 
resemble America's Federal Bureau of Investigation. The former 
Internal Stability Unit will now be known as the Public Order 
Unit and will concentrate on visible policing at taxi ranks, 
marches, festivals and soccer matches. 
  Gun control was highlighted as a special area of concern 
which needed urgent attention. It's been estimated that between 
20,000 and a million illegal weapons are available in the PWV 
area. A peace action plan to resolve conflict between hostel 
and township residents was also proposed, as well as the 
promotion of a constructive relationship between the police and 
the community. A program to reorientate self-defense units has 
already been established.

  [Text] PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Premier 
Tokyo Sexwale today said the South African Police Service's 
negative image has to change urgently. He and members of the 
provincial legislature addressed the police in the region. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Veronica Van der 
Westhuizen] 
Throughout the years policemen have been regarded as thugs by 
the majority of South Africans due to the political situation in 
the country. Mr. Sexwale said that policemen had been used by 
politicians to enforce unpopular laws such as the Group Areas 
Act and the Immorality Act. He today asked the police to leave 
politics in the hands of the government and to make the 
protection of the public its primary task. 
  [Sexwale, in English] Let us strategize together. Let us 
begin to find ways of addressing all the problems that we have 
together. I must tell you, you are some of the most underpaid 
people in this country [applause]. 
  [Van der Westhuizen] Mr. Sexwale said the PWV's executive 
council will support the police in all respects so that it can 
regain lost respectability in the region. He spoke out against 
attacks on policemen. 
  [Sexwale] We won't stand back to see policemen being killed 
in the street -- honest, loyal people who are prepared to uphold 
the law as professional police. 
  [Van der Westhuizen] Mr. Sexwale appealed to policemen, and 
to those who, as he put it, did not deserve to wear a blue 
uniform, to create a police service that will be trusted and 
respected. [end recording]

  [Text] The government forces are still blocking the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in 
Malanje. Over the past few days, they have inflicted heavy 
losses on the rebels in various fronts. Our correspondent 
Francisco Curingana reports: 
  Yesterday, civilian defense combatants stationed in Ngumbue 
and Casseve, 17 km from the city of Malanje, killed nine rebels 
and captured 13 AKM weapons. Later on, during follow up 
operations in the area, the government forces killed another 27 
rebels, including a senior officer. Meanwhile, the population 
are still abandoning the rebel areas. Sixty-seven people 
including old people, women and children from Cambaxe presented 
themselves to government forces yesterday afternoon. They said 
the people are facing hardships in UNITA bases.

  [Text] The World Food Program [WFP] has suspended all 
humanitarian aid flights in Angola, because the National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] has not authorized 
the planned flights into areas under its control. The negative 
effects of the WFP's measure can already be seen. Mercedes 
Sayagues, WFP spokesman for the southern African region, says 
that at least two cities are currently facing considerable food 
shortages, but the WFP will only resume the flights if UNITA 
gives security guarantees. 
  [Begin Sayagues recording] Yesterday the WFP canceled all 
its 
humanitarian flights in Angola because UNITA has not authorized 
the weekly flight plan. A document will be presented to the 
government on 15 June and between 15 and 16 June it will be sent 
to Huambo for UNITA's approval. Without this approval the WFP 
cannot sent its personnel or aircraft to war zones, risking its 
personnel and aircraft. [end recording] 
  The aid is still being distributed by road in safe areas, 
but 
Mercedes Sayagues says this corresponds only to a third of the 
needs. This is the first time this year that WFP flights have 
been totally suspended in Angola. This organization is 
supplying about 70 percent of humanitarian assistance 
distributed in Angola.

  [Text] Cabinda Province Governor Augusto Tomas has been 
talking to all and sundry, namely political forces, traditional 
and church authorities, and even youths. The aim is to search 
for a political solution to the Cabinda problem. So far, the 
meeting has gone well except that the FLEC-FAC [Front for the 
Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave-Cabinda Armed Forces] does not 
wish to cooperate. 
  [Begin recording] [Tomas] As you know, efforts have been 
made 
over the past few years to reach internal consensus and make it 
possible for the government and Cabinda political forces to meet 
and find a peaceful solution to the Cabinda dispute. Yet, some 
of the radical wings, namely FLEC-FAC, have not responded 
positively. Right now, FLEC-FAC and the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola are waging hostile actions against 
civilians. The residents have condemned such actions. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] So, FLEC-FAC is the obstacle. 
  [Tomas] Well, I cannot say that. FLEC-FAC is the political 
grouping that has been hindering a rapid solution to the problem 
in view of the interference by foreign forces opposed to the 
general interests of the people of Cabinda. [end recording] 
  Tomas says FLEC-FAC's absence from the talks is not a major 
problem. Sooner or later there will be a solution to the 
Cabinda problem. What matters is for the provincial government 
to convey to the central government proposals that are endorsed 
by the majority of Cabinda residents. Those whom the governor 
has spoken to are for dialogue and reject war. 
  [Begin Tomas recording] We are encouraged by the fact that 
all those we have spoken to believe that dialogue, instead of 
war is the way of resolving the Cabinda problem. Another 
important aspect is that leading forces living in Cabinda wish 
to play an active role in resolving the Cabinda problem. The 
idea is to mobilize intellectuals in Angola, whether they come 
from Cabinda or not, as well as men of goodwill who live in 
Zaire, Congo and elsewhere who are interested in a solution to 
the Cabinda problem. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Angola National Bank [BNA] intends to set the 
dollar rate at 115,000 new kwanzas to bring it closer to the 
black market rate. Meanwhile, Planning and Economic 
Coordination Minister Jose Pedro de Morais has acknowledged that 
the new foreign exchange regulations have fallen short of the 
expectations. 
  [Begin Morais recording] That is due to a considerable 
increase in fixed expenses and the service of Angola's debt. 
So, the sale of foreign currency by commercial banks has not 
had an impact yet. That is due to two reasons. One is the small 
amounts of cash [preceding word in English] sold by the central 
bank. The other has to do with difficulties we are facing with 
credit lines which are drawn on the BNA, though they ought to be 
endorsed by commercial banks. [end recording] 
  Cruz Neto, head of BNA's management and reserves department, 
says the regular devaluations of the currency are designed to 
meet the goals set by the socioeconomic program. [passage

  [Text] The honorable minister of home affairs, Mr. Lesao 
Lehohla, this morning issued a statement clarifying the 
so-called task force which is being reported as preparing to 
come to Lesotho. 
  In his statement the minister said it had come to the 
attention of the government that the publication of news over 
the foreign radio stations and other media, in connection with 
the so-called task force coming to Lesotho, had again spread 
confusion in the ranks of some of the country's armed forces. 
The statement said, as previously, the issue of the task force, 
which resulted from the recent police strike, was a 
demonstration of the enthusiasm of SADC [Southern African 
Development Community] countries to help in the resolution 
through peaceful means, the difficulty of the lack of stability, 
not only in Lesotho but in other countries in the region, in the 
interest of bringing about peace and economic development in the 
region. 
  He said the issue of the task force should therefore be 
understood as a group of people, in the present circumstances, 
foreign ministers who have been charged with the responsibility 
to make an in depth investigation into the cause of the lack of 
stability in Lesotho. [as heard]

  [Excerpts] Mozambique National Resistance Movement [Renamo] 
President Afonso Dhlakama said in the city of Inhambane 
yesterday that the ongoing registration of voters is not running 
smoothly, allegedly because of fraud promoted by the ruling 
party. Afonso Dhlakama was speaking at a news conference 
shortly after the first provincial cadre conference that began 
on 14 June. 
  Afonso Dhlakama said he had information that two Tanzanians 
have been arrested in Cabo Delgado Province. They had been 
registered for the October elections and were going to vote for 
Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front]. Dhlakama accused 
electoral registration officers of furthering the interests of 
the ruling party, noting that they have been trained by Frelimo. 
He said in registering voters, electoral officers show a 
photograph of the president of the Republic, instructing the 
electorate to vote for Joaquim Chissano. 
  Asked to comment on Renamo's plans to (?monitor the 
registration of voters), Dhlakama said members of his movement 
have already been selected for that purpose. He said tomorrow 
Renamo monitors will be assigned to registration centers to put 
an end to irregularities. Afonso Dhlakama also accused the 
government of hindering the electoral process because no 
registration centers have been established in certain 
localities, forcing the residents to walk for miles to register. 
Dhlakama noted that registration teams should meet the 
electorate and not the other way round. 
  Turning to the role of Renamo advisers, Dhlakama said he was 
disturbed with the manner in which they are being treated in 
Inhambane Province. He said the advisers have no vehicles and 
the governor is undermining their activities. 
  Turning to the Renamo conference, which was designed to 
review party activities in the province, registration and 
education of voters, and the adoption of a Renamo election 
strategy, Dhlakama said those goals had been achieved. He 
described the conference as positive. 
  Meanwhile, the command of the Republic of Mozambique Police 
in Cabo Delgado Province has already denied Renamo's claim that 
two Tanzanians had been detained after being registered as 
voters. 
  Afonso Dhlakama has left for Xai-Xai for a meeting with 
Renamo cadres. The Gaza provincial cadre conference was 
scheduled to begin this afternoon, but had to be postponed due 
to Dhlakama's late arrival. [passage omitted] 
  Renamo spokesman (Rehire Khan) yesterday accused the UN 
Mozambique Civilian Police Command [Civpol] of collaborating 
with the Mozambican Government in violation of the General Peace 
Accord. (Khan) alleged that Civpol elements went to Chigubo 
District without informing the Renamo advisers to the governor 
of Gaza Province. (Khan) noted that Chigubo is a Renamo area.

  [Excerpt] Joao Fareia, spokesman for Nampula's Provincial 
Elections Commission, said yesterday that there are many 
Tanzanians who live along Nampula Province's coastal region, but 
they are there purely for commercial reasons and not to take 
part in the Mozambican elections. 
  Fareia, who was speaking at the end of a restricted session 
of the commission, confirmed that two Tanzanians tried to 
register at one of the centers in the capital of Mossuril 
District. They produced their passports, but then changed their 
minds after being briefed on who was supposed to register. 
Fareia's remarks come in the wake of allegations by Mozambique 
National Resistance's political delegation in Nampula that many 
Tanzanians were reporting to registration centers in the Isle of 
Mozambique and Mossuril. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Portuguese News Agency, LUSA, quotes studies 
published in the latest monthly information bulletin of France's 
Medicins Sans Frontieres organization that more than 10,000 
people have been victims of explosive devices in Mozambique 
since the General Peace Accord was signed. 
  The source reports that studies carried out by the British 
humanitarian organization [name indistinct] concluded that the 
number of mines in Mozambique is significantly less than the 2 
million previously estimated. In its report, the organization 
expresses concern over mines in rural areas and added that with 
the return of refugees many land mines are being discovered as 
the land is being burned and cultivated. The Manhica, Moamba, 
and Boane Districts in Maputo Province, and Caia and Nhamatanda 
Districts in Sofala Province, have recorded the highest number 
of victims following mine explosions.

violence have grown after an opposition politician urged his 
supporters to keep weapons to protect themselves from attack by 
members of the ruling party. The leader of the Forum Party, Mr. 
Justice Enoch Dumbuchena, said members of his party would be 
ready to retaliate against assaults by youths who have been 
urged by President Robert Mugabe to launch a house-to-house 
campaign to drum up support for his ZANU-PF [Zimbabwe African 
National Union-Patriotic Front] Party.

  [Text] The Zimbabwean Government has granted large 
allowances and salary increases of between 10 to 23 percent to 
members of Zimbabwe's civil service and Armed Forces. Reports 
said the salary increases would cost Zimbabwean taxpayers about 
217 million U.S. dollars. Low paid workers were given salary 
increments of 23 percent to match Zimbabwe's annual inflation 
rate and others were given between 10 to 23 percent. In 
addition, all government employees were given transport and 
housing allowances. A government spokesman said those working 
in government had been most affected by the high cost of living 
because their salaries and conditions of service had not matched 
inflation. The report said in comparison salary increases for 
private sector workers had been on average around 15 percent.

recent pronouncements by the U.S. Government to cut off all aids 
and diplomatic efforts for peace in the Liberian crisis because 
of continuing setbacks in the full implementation of the peace 
accord. 
  The Transitional Legislative Assembly subcommittee on 
disarmament headed by Dusty Wolokolie, and the committee on 
reconciliation, headed by former Margibi County representative 
under the defunct NDPL [National Democratic Party of Liberia] 
government, David Menyongai, are presently in Gbarnga holding 
talks with the leadership of the NPFL [National Patriotic Front 
of Liberia] in Gbarnga.

  [Excerpts] Dakar, 15 Jun (AFP) -- Three Malian Tuareg 
movements have called on their fighters integrated into the 
Malian Army to quit their barracks following recent clashes 
within the Tuareg community, a reliable source told AFP today. 
  This decision certainly nullifies the April 1992 national 
peace pact signed between the Malian Government and the Tuaregs. 
The pact notably stipulated the incorporation of former rebels 
into the regular national Army. "The risk of an outbreak of 
violence has never been so high since two years but in-fighting 
within the Tuareg community explains the attitude adopted by 
each group toward the pact," the same source added. 
  The 10 and 12 June clashes led to the death of 30 Tuaregs 
belonging to the Unified Movement and Front of Azaouad [MFUA]. 
During the incidents one of the movement's component groups, the 
Popular Movement of the Azaouad [MPA], was targeted by the three 
others and now the MPA remains the only group the government can 
negotiate with. 
  The three other MFUA member groups -- the Islamic Arab Front 
of the Azaouad [FIAA], the Revolutionary Army for the Liberation 
of Azaouad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Azaouad 
have asked their "fighters" integrated into the Army to return 
to their bases in northern Mali. Furthermore, the FIAA's 
representative to the government, Zaha Bi, is no longer in 
Bamako. 
  The Malian Government, which is criticized by the political 
parties for being lax about Tuareg demands, has for several 
months been pressurized by MFUA, notably over the issue of 
integrating former rebels into the Army. [passage omitted] 
  The military hierarchy has always been reticent about 
incorporating Tuaregs into the Army and is opposed to their 
recruitment to the grade of officers. The MFUA puts the number 
of former fighters at 7,000 and says that "massive 
incorporation" is the only way to stop the attacks. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] It will be recalled that three days ago, the 
Nigerian police declared Chief M.K.O. Abiola wanted in 
connection with some alleged treasonable activities. A few 
hours ago, Mohamed Okoija took up the deputy inspector general 
of police, Nuhu Aliyu, on the progress in the police search for 
Chief Abiola. 
  [Begin recording] [Aliyu] Yesterday, we carried out some 
searches of some areas where we suspected he could be found but 
he wasn't there. 
  [Okoija] Now, in the news today, one of his wives, [name 
indistinct], says Chief Abiola is ill and will report to the 
police when he is well. Has this got to you officially? 
  [Aliyu, hesitating] To the police that he is....[pauses] 
Yes, 
it got to us officially, and [words indistinct]. 
  [Okoija] Well, Chief Abiola's camp continues to affirm that 
he proclaimed himself as president, and there were pictures in 
the papers on Tuesday [14 June] which purported that to be so. 
What is the police reaction to this one now? 
  [Aliyu] Our reaction is that that was one of the gimmicks, 
of 
photoplay. We don't believe there was anything like that. 
  [Okoija] Okay. Now, a former senator who is an aide to Chief 
Abiola says that.... 
  [Aliyu, interrupting] Pardon? 
  [Okoija] A former senator who is an aide to Chief Abiola 
says 
Chief Abiola will address his supporters anytime from now, and 
that they have their own strategy. 
  [Aliyu] As soon as we find Abiola, we will pick him up. 
Anywhere, anywhere he shows up, we will pick him up. Anywhere 
we see him. After all, he is a wanted person. 
  [Okoija] Now, what about this threat of chaos in the western 
part of the country? How prepared is the police, knowing that 
the western part of the country is a hotbed of political riot? 
  [Aliyu] As you can see, we have got ourselves well prepared. 
Not only have we mobilized the police within the area in 
question, but we have brought in other policemen, mobile police 
forces from other parts of the country, to beef up security in 
this area. [end recording] 
  [Paris AFP in English at 1212 GMT on 15 June, in a 
Lagos-datelined item, says: "Moshood Abiola, the tycoon who has 
declared himself president of Nigeria, will make a public 
appearance `this week' in defiance of the junta which is hunting 
him, an opposition spokesman said Wednesday. The national 
secretary of the National Democratic Coalition, which backs 
Abiola's claim to power, said Abiola will `definitely (come out 
of hiding) this week.' `It will be a public event, at which the 
press, including the international media, will be in 
attendance,' the secretary, Ayo Opadokun, said as the junta took 
steps to beef up security in the southwestern regions where the 
Yoruba businessman draws much of his support."]

  [Text] It has been an exciting few days for Nigerian 
politician Moshood Abiola. He was the presumed winner of last 
June's aborted presidential election, and on Monday [as heard], 
after escaping from house arrest, he defied General Abacha's 
military government by publicly declaring himself president of 
Nigeria, then went into hiding. But apparently Moshood Abiola 
has now fallen ill. Jeremy Skeet called his home in Lagos and 
talked to his wife, Kudirat Abiola, and asked how her husband 
was. 
  [Begin recording] [Kudirat Abiola] You know, before the 
inauguration, my husband had been ill. He was even 
hospitalized, and as soon as he got out of the hospital, he 
decided to proclaim his mandate. On the day of the 
proclamation, he was down with heavy cold, and since then he has 
been very cold and shivery. 
  [Skeet] Is he bedridden at the moment? 
  [Kudirat Abiola] Yes, he is in bed. 
  [Skeet] Are you in contact with your husband? 
  [Kudirat Abiola] I am in contact with him. 
  [Skeet] How do you contact your husband? 
  [Kudirat Abiola] I do call him over the phone. 
  [Skeet] Where is he at the moment? 
  [Kudirat Abiola] He is in Lagos. 
  [Skeet] But where, exactly? 
  [Kudirat Abiola] No, I want to keep that to myself for now. 
  [Skeet] And you say he is ill, but what is his spirit like 
otherwise? 
  [Kudirat Abiola] His spirit is very high, except that he is 
tired. 
  [Skeet] Now, a lot of his supporters want him to appear in 
public. When do you think he is going to be better and appear 
in public? 
  [Kudirat Abiola] Well, maybe before this week comes to an 
end or early next week. 
  [Skeet] Is that a guarantee? By the end of next week, are 
we going to see Chief Abiola in public? 
  [Kudirat Abiola] Of course, yes. 
  [Skeet] Right, because a lot of his critics say that he is a 
coward and you are just using this excuse of his illness.... 
  [Kudirat Abiola, interrupting] That is not true! He is not. 
My husband is not a coward. He is on the right path. Why 
should he run from anybody? If Gen. Sani Abacha who usurped his 
power, if that one can be moving freely in Nigeria, what stops 
my husband? He is never a coward, and he will never be one.

  [Text] It seems pressure is building up in Nigeria for 
Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of last year's aborted 
presidential elections, to make a public appearance. He's gone 
into hiding since he declared himself a rightful president at 
the weekend, in defiance of General Sani Abacha's military 
government. He is now a wanted man with a price on his head, 
and there are reports that he is also in bed, suffering from a 
heavy cold. But according to the National Democratic Coalition, 
Nadeco, which is backing Abiola's campaign, Moshood Abiola could 
soon be sticking his neck out again. From Lagos, Sola Odunfa 
reports: 
  [Begin Odunfa recording] There are strong indications that 
Chief Moshood Abiola will come out of hiding soon to announce 
his next political action and, consequently, give himself up to 
the police. The National Democratic Coalition, Nadeco, which 
has been actively promoting his cause, said in a statement in 
Lagos today that Chief Abiola was, quote, now hail and hearty, 
unquote. Nadeco said in the statement, which was signed by its 
general secretary, Mr. (Ayo Kpadokun), that Chief Abiola was 
currently holding meetings and consultations, and that he would 
come out to announce his government and the arrangements for his 
sovereign national conference. The statement addressed Chief 
Abiola as president, and it called on the international 
community to accord him and his government recognition. 
  Chief Abiola was declared a wanted person last weekend. The 
police promised a reward of 50,000 naira, which is about 1,500 
pounds sterling, to anyone who can give information on his 
whereabouts. The fugitive political leader is believed to be in 
Lagos, but the security forces have still not got a clue to his 
trail. Political sources hint today that Chief Abiola may make 
his public appearance at a rally late next week. The venue and 
timing are being kept secret. The closest clue I was offered 
was that it would be somewhere in western Nigeria. Chief Abiola 
is from Abeokuta in Ogun State, which is next door to Lagos 
State. Speculations are that he would like to make his arrest a 
public drama, and probably maximize its political benefit to 
himself. [end recording]

  [Text] Following conflicting reports in the local and 
foreign media about Chief Moshood Abiola's whereabouts, Mohamed 
Okoija sought clarification from Alhaji Nuhu Aliyu, deputy 
inspector general of police in charge of operations, who is 
leading the search for him. 
  [Begin recording] [Aliyu] Well, if you can remember clearly, 
in one of the interviews we have had either with you or with 
somebody else, I have always maintained that Abiola is in Lagos, 
and Chief Abiola, you know, is somebody who has a lot of places 
where he can take refuge, and a lot of people know it but they 
are not forthcoming to let us know. It is, in fact, very 
difficult for us to locate him without the cooperation of the 
general public, and this cooperation we are not receiving. 
  [Okoija] Well, perhaps that can be expected because of the 
type of clout that he has. But, one wonders why all this is 
able to beat police network which we know nowadays is very 
sophisticated. 
  [Aliyu] It is not very unusual that a person like Abiola in 
Lagos cannot be located. It is not unusual at all. What is 
very surprising is that in spite of all the efforts we have 
made....[pauses] We have struck a quite a number places, hoping 
that we were going to find him, and up to this moment we have 
not been able to do so. I just want to appeal to the members of 
the general public that as soon as they know or suspect where he 
is they should let us know. After all, he is not the only 
person that was declared wanted by the police, and those who 
were declared wanted by the police earlier than him showed up, 
and they are now in the court of law. If he shows up, he will 
eventually go to the court of law where he can be able to defend 
himself. I am surprised and disappointed why he has not shown 
up. 
  [Okoija] Now, well, maybe the public is not cooperating 
because the price you put on him is not attractive enough. 
  [Aliyu] In fact, to be honest with you, we shouldn't have 
put 
any price on him. The public should -- not only the public -- 
himself, he should have shown up. As soon as it was declared 
that he was wanted, he should have come out and said: Look, I 
am here. What are you looking for me for? And, (?that is how) 
we should now come, take him, take his statement, ask questions, 
and then we shall be in a position to know exactly what is going 
on. 
  As at now, he is leaving everybody in doubt, because a 
person 
of his standing should not leave people in doubt. He should 
come forward and say exactly what it is all about. The 
utterances of the wife and the utterances of the Nadeco 
[National Democratic Coalition], these are just their 
utterances. In fact, they are just compounding issues for Chief 
Abiola, because as far as we are concerned, we of the police -- 
because the Nadeco secretary or the spokesman of the Nadeco, one 
(Ayo), (Bob Ayo) who has been saying that Abiola, they are 
making preparations to receive him in a big way -- well, if they 
are making preparations to receive him in a big way, then we of 
the police, on our own part, we are more than prepared to 
receive him, and I can assure you that as soon as Chief Abiola 
shows up, wherever, whenever, we shall be there to pick him up. 
[sentence as heard] 
  [Okoija] Well, his camp is calling on him to form his 
government. That is a serious development. If he does form a 
government, what do we expect? 
  [Aliyu] Government? I suppose you do understand that it is 
government of the day, and I suppose you know it yourself that 
even Abiola himself has recognized that government. If you 
(?have been) watching the television advert, it has always been 
showing that when Abacha became the president and commander in 
chief of this country, Abiola went to receive him, and 
congratulated him for becoming the commander in chief and head 
of state of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. If he sets up a 
parallel government, or as it is being claimed that he has 
proclaimed himself the president -- because if you read the 
interview or listened to the interview granted by Kudirat 
Abiola, it appears as if she was talking as the wife of a 
president -- that is treason, treason, a felony, a treasonable 
felony. Declaration of a parallel government, or a parallel 
government when in fact there is [a] government of the day, the 
offense is treason. 
  [Okoija] Have you people been able to ascertain whether 
Chief 
Abiola is doing all this because he has encouragement from 
international quarters? 
  [Aliyu] Well, if international bodies are encouraging him to 
commit treason -- a felony in Nigeria, a serious felony in 
Nigeria -- well, that is their own business. As far as we are 
concerned, in Nigeria, a person committing a treasonable felony 
-- if you remember there was a similar incident where a group of 
politicians in Nigeria were tried and convicted of a treasonable 
felony. [sentence as heard] [end recording]

  [Text] Imprisoned chairman of Nigeria's Campaign for 
Democracy, Dr. Beko Ransome-Kuti, says he has begun a hunger 
strike. In a letter from Alagbon Police Station in Lagos to the 
attorney general and justice minister, Olu Onagoruwa, Dr. 
Ransome-Kuti said he had been kept in appalling circumstances 
without food. He said that after reporting to the police last 
week, he should have been kept in court or granted bail. Dr. 
Ransome-Kuti was jailed after the Campaign for Democracy called 
for street protests against the military government, to mark the 
anniversary of last year's annulled presidential elections on 12 
June.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] The SUN RAY, in its editorial, is worried about the 
political situation in Nigeria and says the annulled 12 June 
presidential election result, which is the bone of contention 
for the pro-democracy agitators, should be resolved in the 
interest of the nation. It however says the government of 
General Sani Abacha is doing something in that regard through 
the forthcoming national constitutional conference. The SUN RAY 
appeals to the Federal Government to resist any temptation that 
will make it arrest more members of the pro-democracy groups, 
particularly Nadeco [National Democratic Coalition] leaders, 
unless it has concrete evidence of criminal activities against 
them. According to the SUN RAY, mere opposition to government's 
views about events in Nigeria should not be enough reason.

  [Text] Hundreds of refugees have flooded into Burundi's 
capital, Bujumbura, following an Army crackdown on armed 
civilians and reports of massacres near the border with Rwanda. 
Reports said over a hundred people who fled into Burundi to 
escape Rwanda's bloodbath had been killed at Bugabira in the 
Kirundo Province. An aid worker said all the dead were Rwandan 
refugees, and that at least another 20 people were also killed 
in the weekend violence in the nearby town Kayanza, where 
Burundi's Tutsi dominated Army has launched a counter operation 
against Rwandans entering the country. Aid agencies said between 
1,500 and 2,000 refugees had flocked into Bujumbura following 
several days of fighting in the hills around the city. The 
fighting began last weekend.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] The approval of the document regarding the 
installation of the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] and its senior officials has been postponed due 
to last minute differences. Everything remains the same, since 
at the last minute the UNITA representatives decided to postpone 
approving the document being discussed, alleging that they need 
more time to reflect. UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin 
Beye, who is mediating the Angolan peace process, is trying to 
control the situation by holding constant meetings with the 
UNITA team. 
  Meanwhile, the mediator has decided to release the 
government's negotiating team until 1600 tomorrow. It is 
presumed that by then UNITA may have a concrete and objective 
idea regarding the document still being discussed, which 
well-informed sources say may be approved. If that happens, the 
government and UNITA negotiators will then discuss the 
implementation of modalities on installing UNITA and its senior 
officials.

  [Text] Jonas Savimbi's soldiers are still shelling the city 
of Kuito. Today more than eight civilians were killed and more 
than 20 others wounded. Our correspondent Abel Abraao reports: 
  [Abraao] Today the center of the city was attacked and 
more than 20 civilians were wounded and eight others killed. 
The victims of the shellings and shooting over the past 24 
hours include a child from an orphanage who was mortally wounded 
by National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
[UNITA] soldiers when carrying water. 
  Meanwhile, Antonio Muhongo, provincial delegate of the 
Angola National Liberation Front, FNLA, described the food 
situation of the Kuito residents as catastrophic. The political 
official today told our local newsdesk that famine is killing 
innocent children, women and old people and appealed for an end 
to clashes and the resumption of humanitarian aid operations. He 
said the people's interests should be above individual interests 
and appealed to the international community to urge UNITA to 
accept the government's offer and put an end to the war. 
  In Malanje, the atmosphere is different. The government 
forces have inflicted yet more losses on UNITA. Military 
sources revealed that today more than four UNITA rebels were 
killed in Quemba, along the road linking Malanje to Cambondo. 
Our correspondent Francisco Curingana reports: 
  [Curingana] A well informed military source today told 
the provincial radio station that four other rebels were killed 
in Quemba, along the road linking Malanje to Cambondo. On the 
occasion, the government forces captured two AKM weapons and 
a [word indistinct]. The Angolan Armed Forces 
[FAA], National Police, and the civilian defense 
maintain an active defense of all consolidated positions. The 
environment in the city has not altered, public services, 
markets and schools are functioning normally, and the political 
and military situation is under the control of government 
forces. 
  In Moxico Province, six battalions of Black Cockerel 
soldiers 
are regrouping to attack the city of Luena. These soldiers have 
been expelled from Lunda Sul Province, according to our 
correspondent in Moxico Pedro Sofrimento: 
  [Sofrimento] This was revealed by Colonel Mario Nelson 
Mendes, second in command of the Military Region of Independent 
Moxico, in an exclusive interview with Radio Nacional de Angola. 
The FAA senior officer said this movement of UNITA troops from 
the south to the east of the province is not news and the 
government forces are ready to respond to them. It is this 
fighting spirit of the FAA, National Police, and civilian 
defense that permitted the reoccupation of Camanongue District 
at 1400 on 12 June after hard clashes on three different 
occasions in which 11 rebels were killed and an assortment of 
war materiel was captured. 
  [Mendes] At present UNITA has avoided direct contact 
with our forces in the north, in Lunda Sul Province. Its forces 
fled to Moxico Province and I can say that at present 
[words indistinct] the territory. 
  [Sofrimento] Colonel Mendes concluded his interview by 
saying that while the politicians are involved in talks, the 
soldiers defend the physical integrity of the nation and the 
people.

  [Text] Ouagadougou, June 15 (AFP) -- Authorities in Burkina 
Faso said Wednesday [15 June] that an attack by "Tuareg rebels" 
had been carried out on its territory, the first time such an 
incident has been officially acknowledged. 
  Interior Ministry Secretary General Pascal Benon said the 
group, probably from Mali, opened fire on a coachload of 
passengers on June 9 near Djibo, 190 kilometres (120 miles) 
north of Ouagadougou and injured three of them. The group also 
intercepted an official car, Benon said. 
  Several other clashes have been reported since last 
December. 
  The Tuareg rebellion has been raging in neighbouring Mali 
and 
Niger since the early 1990s, leading some 7,000 people to seek 
refuge in Burkina Faso. 
  Military reinforcements were sent to the area at the start 
of 
the week. Benon said the situation was "very tense" and 
stressed that there was a danger local people might decide to 
"settle their scores with the Tuaregs for themselves." 
  The refugees have gradually been relocated in a camp run by 
the UN High Commissioner for Refugees at the village of Ferrelio 
to the north of Djibo. 
  The authorities in Ouagadougou want the UNHCR to move the 
camp away from the border. However, the UNHCR wants Burkina 
Faso, one of the poorest countries in the world, to pay the 
costs, estimated at 184 million CFA Francs (330,000 dollars). 
  The country's 1,000-kilometre (600-mile) frontier with Mali 
and the 500-kilometre (300-mile) one with Niger are considered 
practically uncontrollable by the Ministry.

  [Text] Nairobi, June 16 (AFP) -- Rwandan refugees rioted in 
a camp in Tanzania and threatened to kill foreign relief workers 
in anger at a ban on suspected mass killers entering the camp, 
aid officials said Thursday [16 June]. 
  About 50 foreign aid workers left the camp after angry 
refugees hurled stones and shouted threats at them on Wednesday, 
a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) said. 
  The rioters dispersed after Tanzanian police went into the 
Benaco Camp near the northern border with Rwanda and fired in 
the air, the spokesman, Panos Moumtzis, said in Nairobi. 
  The trouble started when a well-known Hutu suspected of 
committing atrocities during Rwanda's 10-week ethnic and 
political bloodbath returned to the camp. 
  The man, who was not named, had been arrested by Tanzanian 
police in April with about 15 other Rwandans suspected of 
massacres when they crossed the border into Tanzania along with 
hundreds of thousands of refugees. 
  They were freed a week ago on condition that they stayed out 
of the refugee camp, but one man returned on what he said was a 
visit to his wife and children. 
  A riot erupted when UNHCR representatives went to the camp 
to 
protest against his presence which they feared could spark 
trouble, Moumtzis said. 
  "There were about three thousand people shouting, screaming 
and throwing stones," he said. "They wanted him to stay at the 
camp. They dispersed when Tanzanian policemen went in and 
started shooting in the air." 
  Relief officials say many suspected mass murderers have 
crossed into Tanzania, mingling with civilian refugees from 
fighting. About 300,000 Rwandans including Hutus and minority 
Tutsis are encamped at Benaco. 
  Up to half a million Rwandans, mostly Tutsis and Hutu 
opposition supporters, have been butchered since the April 6 
death of president Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, rekindled the 
civil war between mainly Tutsi rebels and the government, and 
sparked massacres committed mainly by extremist Hutu militias.

  [Text] Kigali, 16 Jun (AFP) -- Nearly 200 Rwandans were 
injured in fierce shelling overnight in the capital Kigali and 
two UN soldiers were seriously wounded in a grenade or mine 
blast Friday [17 June], Red Cross and UN sources said. A Red 
Cross hospital in a government-held sector of Kigali admitted 
180 soldiers and civilians injured in battles between Rwandan 
rebels and government forces, officials of the International 
Committee of the Red Cross said. 
  The two UN officers, one from Bangladesh and the other from 
Uruguay, were hurt in what was believed to have been a grenade 
or mine explosion about 20 kilometres (12 miles) north-west of 
Kigali during a reconnaissance mission on the road to the town 
of Ruhengeri, UN military sources said. No further details were 
immediately available and it was unclear who was responsible for 
the explosion. 
  Fighting erupted despite a shaky two-day-old ceasefire 
between rebel and government forces. Rebel commandos of the 
mainly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front freed about 400 civilians 
in a commando raid early Friday on a church behind government 
lines where militiamen of the Hutu majority are believed to have 
abducted and killed hundreds of people. Other rebel forces 
started firing to create a diversion, and the 180 wounded 
people, including civilians and soldiers, were believed to have 
been hurt in the ensuing fighting.

  [Excerpt] We go back to the Rwandan problem with our guest, 
Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko. Assane Diop met him in 
Tunis this morning. He asked him if he really thought that the 
Rwandan belligerents will respect the cease-fire agreement 
negotiated under the mediation of the Great Lakes countries: 
  [Begin recording] [Mobutu] I think so. The two parties 
promised to respect the cease-fire and its immediate 
implementation unconditionally in the presence of the heads of 
state of the region. 
  [Diop] What will your role be later in the implementation of 
the cease-fire? 
  [Mobutu] In the Rwandan conflict, my role has always been 
that of a mediator. Now, concerning the follow up and the 
supervision of this cease-fire, either all the heads of state of 
the region will go to Arusha for the dialogue that will be 
started immediately, or each of us will send a delegate or a 
representative [to Arusha]. 
  [Diop] And what have you decided about the peacekeeping 
force? 
  [Mobutu] I believe eight African countries have already 
agreed to provide the UN with troops. 
  [Diop] What about France's position on this issue, Mr. 
President? 
  [Mobutu] My deputy foreign minister followed [French Foreign 
Minister] Mr. Juppe's statement on TV. As far as I am concerned 
there are two things: either the two parties [to the Rwandan 
conflict] who have agreed on a cease-fire, behave with honesty 
toward each other or they do not behave with honesty. I think 
France is not the only state [prepared to become involved]. 
Other states are ready to intervene to put an end to this 
horror. As far as Zaire is concerned, had we intervened in 
Rwanda, the situation would be different today. 
  [Diop] Has your meeting here [in Tunis] helped to remove 
suspicion? 
  [Mobutu] I have two answers to your question: First, those 
who have proof that my country supplied arms [to the Rwandan 
Government] should provide it. Second, Museveni was the first 
to congratulate me on the success of the mini-summit of heads of 
state of the region that I chaired on Tuesday. There is no 
problem regarding this issue. [Words indistinct] for the 
liberation of his country. I think that as far as Rwanda is 
concerned, we, the heads of state, absolutely should not be 
hypocritical. It is easy to say Zaire is supplying arms. Let 
me emphasize again that if Zaire intervened [in Rwanda] the 
situation would be different. [end recording] [passage omitted]

union federation, the Nigeria Labor Congress [NLC], this evening 
called on the military government of General Sani Abacha to 
"withdraw totally from the running of the country's affairs in 
the interest of democracy." 
  In a statement issued at the end of a meeting of its central 
committee, the NLC said in view of "the persistent political 
instability," the aspiration to immediate democracy, and "the 
very difficult economic situation" of the country, it has noted 
that "the military cannot resolve these problems."

  [Text] The Federal Government says its attention has been 
drawn to reports saying that a meeting of northern elders forum 
with the elected conference candidates from the northern states 
is to held on Saturday [18 June]. 
  In a press release issued by the chief press secretary to 
the 
chief of general staff, Mr. Tsika Ngwozu, the Federal Government 
restated that the ban on meetings of all political associations, 
regional, or ethnic groupings is still in force, and that any 
breach of the ban will not be tolerated. It said law 
enforcement agencies had been directed to ensure that such 
meeting of the northern elders forum, or that of any other 
political, regional, or ethnic grouping, does not take place in 
any state of the federation.

  [Excerpts] While in Lusaka, the government and the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] are 
negotiating peace, here in Angola things are not going well. 
  UNITA is just showing that it wants to continue the war. 
This is evidenced by the fact that it began to shell the city 
of N'dalatando in Cuanza Norte Province and its outskirts at 
dawn yesterday. According to a military source, this happened 
after government forces repelled an unspecified number of troops 
of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] who 
tried to infiltrate into Catombe de Baixo area. Government 
forces killed more than 10 rebels, took one prisoner, and 
captured a quantity of war materiel. [passage omitted] 
  UNITA rebels are also carrying out actions in Malanje but 
are 
being repelled by government troops. Our correspondent reports. 
  [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] Another three 
rebels were put out of action today, 4 km south of (Caema) and 
14 km from the city of Malanje. Government forces also captured 
a quantity of war materiel from the rebels. This was revealed 
by an authorized military force. Heavy clashes were also taking 
place today between government forces and UNITA rebels in 
Cateve, Bumba, Lao, and Cabindondo. The results of this action 
are not yet known. What is more, four UNITA (?soldiers) have 
presented themselves to government authorities in Malanje. 
Government forces continue to control the political and 
military situation in the city. [end recording] 
  The city of Kuito in Bie Province is in a similar situation. 
UNITA does not want to leave the people of that city in peace. 
It continues to shell it in its plan to overrun it at any cost.

<F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Angola -- where the war seems to have reached a new 
intensity as rebel UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] forces scale up their military 
offensive. At present, this offensive seems to be centered on 
the government-held southern [as heard] city of Kuito, which is 
surrounded by UNITA forces. But to try and get a clearer picture 
of what's happening throughout the country, Emily Kasrils called 
the deputy foreign minister of the ruling MPLA [Popular Movement 
for the Liberation of Angola] government, Jorge Chikoty. On the 
line to Luanda last night, she started by asking him about the 
latest situation in Kuito: 
  [Begin recording] [Chikoty] Well, the latest situation we 
have on Kuito is very, very bad. There are about six UNITA 
divisions that have been shelling the city of Kuito for the past 
few weeks [indistinct words] as many as eight people dead and 20 
people wounded including a number of children. There is still a 
lot of fighting around the city of Kuito, and we are rather 
concerned about this situation. We think that UNITA's strategy 
is to take over the city of Kuito before major steps in the 
negotiations taking place in Lusaka are (?taken). 
  [Kasrils] There also appears to be fighting in the oil 
enclave of Cabinda, where UNITA has reportedly made an alliance 
with the FLEC [Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave] 
group. Now, this is going to have serious implications for your 
funding of your military campaign in Angola, isn't it? 
  [Chikoty] No. What I think is that in Cabinda we do not have 
major military movements from UNITA, but we know that there is 
in fact some kind of a link between UNITA and the FLEC-FAC 
[Cabinda Armed Forces], which is quite an old alliance. But we 
do not think that UNITA has the capacity of taking over the 
(?fields) of Cabinda. 
  [Kasrils] But most of your revenue that you are using to 
fight the war with UNITA is derived from Cabinda and, therefore, 
anything that happens to those oil fields will have implications 
to your ability to fight. 
  [Chikoty] Oil plays an important part in our budget for 
everything -- not only for the war, but also for all the other 
social and economic responsibilities that the government has. 
We are not surprised. This is not a new tendency in the 
Angolan war, but what we can say is that we do not think that 
UNITA has this capacity of taking over Cabinda. We are also 
hoping that there will be peace. The government's global 
strategy is not to go on fighting, but is to find a negotiable 
solution to the Angolan crisis. That is why we have been 
negotiating for eight months with UNITA. 
  [Kasrils] But if things carry on like they are doing at the 
moment, it is just going to be that the killing is going to 
continue. The talks in Lusaka haven't reached any conclusion 
after eight months, and the people in Angola are going to 
continue dying because neither of you are able to come to an 
agreement. 
  [Chikoty] We are saying is that UNITA is fighting for no 
reason. What I am trying to tell you is that UNITA has got to 
stop fighting against the legitimate government. What would you 
expect from us? Do you want us to abdicate from our 
responsibilities? It's not the government that has gone into 
fighting. It's UNITA that went into fighting. So, you cannot 
put UNITA and the government on the same table -- I mean on the 
same level. [end recording]

  [Text] Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] President 
Afonso Dhlakama gave assurances yesterday that his party will 
take part in elections scheduled for October this year, even if 
the money donated by the international community is not enough. 
Dhlakama said that Renamo's electoral campaign will not require 
a lot of funds, adding that "what we want is transportation to 
be able to move about." 
  The Renamo leader, who was speaking at a well-attended news 
conference, said during his visit to the United States he 
informed UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali about this. 
Afonso Dhlakama also said that during his meeting with 
Butrus-Ghali, they also discussed the peace process in 
Mozambique, the confinement and demobilization of troops, the 
training of a single and nonpartisan army, and the difficulties 
that "we are facing." He also said he held meetings with 
members of the UN Security Council during which they discussed 
the issue of the "trust fund." He said there were problems 
because the figures allegedly announced by the media are not 
correct. Afonso Dhlakama said, however, that "modalities are 
being studied to find a solution to this issue of the trust 
fund." 
  Dhlakama, who described his first official visit to the 
United States as successful, stressed that Renamo is ready for 
the October general elections, "although we do not possess 
material resources." He said: "We cannot say that we will not 
take part in elections because of lack of material resources". 
  According to Renamo leader, the United States promised to 
contribute $1 million for his movement's "trust fund". Asked 
whether he was happy with the U.S. contribution to his movement, 
Afonso Dhlakama said yes. He stressed however that the money 
was not enough but then said "a donation is never little." 
  The Renamo leader still advocates the establishment of a 
government of national unity and said that he had presented his 
proposals to the U.S. Administration. "They said it was a good 
idea, and they even promised to convey the message to President 
Joaquim Chissano," Dhlakama said. 
  On the disappearance of 12,000 troops from the government 
army, the Renamo leader said the U.S. Administration accepted 
his request for greater monitoring of the situation and the need 
to "warn the government led by the Mozambique Liberation Front 
[Frelimo] Party." He said the "disappearance" of these troops 
was a "serious" issue and not a problem of arithmetic "as the 
government tries to explain it." 
  Dhlakama said his movement thinks these troops were 
transferred to the Police Force, since a similar situation took 
place in Angola, where the Government led by the Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola diverted 80,000 troops to 
the Police Force. 
  During his recent visit to the United States, the Renamo 
leader was confronted with accusations that his movement used 
children during the war against the Mozambican Government. In 
reply, Dhlakama said he told Americans that in Africa it is a 
common to use children in war. As examples, he said liberation 
movements such as the African National Congress, the South-West 
African People's Organization, the Zimbabwe African National 
Union, and Frelimo also used children during war. Afonso 
Dhlakama clearly admitted for the first time that his movement 
used minors during its war against the government led by 
Frelimo, when he said that "all parties use children." 
  At the news conference, the Renamo leader also referred to 
the voter registration process now under way in the country. He 
said foreigners have already been detected registering as 
voters. Dhlakama said that in Cabo Delgado Province two 
Tanzanians were detained by police for trying to register as 
voters. 
  The Renamo leader also said he was going to register as 
voter 
in Maputo today and then leave for Inhambane Province, where he 
will preside over a conference of Renamo cadres. He also 
revealed he will visit the provinces of Sofala, Manica, and Tete 
beginning 20 June.

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos Mhuia] </F>
  [Text] (Xai-Xai)--Afonso Dhlakama has once again accused 
the electoral registration teams (in Sofala, Tete, and Gaza) of 
favoring the government. 
  "They bring two photographs -- one of Chissano's and another 
of mine -- and then say: `Those who are going to vote for 
Chissano step to this side, and those voting for Dhlakama step 
to that side.' Those who will vote for Chissano are the first to 
be registered." 
  That accusation was made yesterday at an informal news 
conference during Renamo's [Mozambique National Resistance] Gaza 
provincial conference, which Dhlakama is chairing. According to 
Dhlakama, Renamo made a mistake by approving the section of the 
Electoral Law that entitles government to establish registration 
teams. 
  Dhlakama said right now the struggle is "political" and not 
an "armed one," adding that Renamo is getting ready for the 
"second victory," the "first phase of which is the registration 
of voters." He said Renamo members should be encouraged to 
regard civic education "as an immediate step." 
  He told MEDIAFAX: "We have never prevented registration and 
civic education teams from entering our areas. It is a 
government ploy to prevent people living in Renamo areas from 
being registered, because the government knows that they will 
vote for Renamo. In fact, we are forcing the government to 
register people under Renamo control." 
  Dhlakama, who says he is involved in a preelectoral 
campaign, 
criticized Chissano for campaigning for Frelimo [Mozambique 
Liberation Front] in his capacity as head of state. Chissano 
has been declaring "days off so that managers and students 
attend his rallies; factories have been closed down." He added: 
"That is a violation of the Rome accord." 
  At the Renamo conference, delegates asked for financial 
assistance and transportation. Renamo "is going to give them 
bicycles, motorcycles, and money for bus fares." No automobiles 
will be provided "because we lack them for every district."

  [Text] The [word indistinct] repatriation IOM 
[International Organization for Migration] exercise for 24,000 
registered Mozambican refugees by the United Nations have been 
completed. 
  In an interview this morning, the resident high commissioner 
for refugees, Mr. Gary Perkins, said the exercise was completed 
on the 3d of this month. United Nations hired train coaches 
last year to transport the refugees with effect from last 
August. The train services to Maputo have been operating once a 
week since then. Out of the 24,000 registered Mozambicans, only 
a few are still in the country and will be taken back by bus 
shortly. 
  Thousands of unregistered Mozambicans are still all over the 
country. Mr. Perkins said they are at liberty to contact his 
office if they need assistance to go back to their country. He 
said the secondary school in Ndzevane refugee camp, built by the 
United Nations for the refugees who arrived in the country more 
than 17 years ago, will continue to operate since many Swazi 
nationals have already taken advantage of its presence in the 
area. The primary school in Malindza camp will be [word 
indistinct] between government and the United Nations office in 
Mbabane. 
  Meanwhile the kingdom now has a total of 40 new refugees 
from 
Somalia.

  [Text] The Zambian Government has frozen salary increments 
for politicians and top civil servants to help improve the 
country's economy. Zambian President Frederick Chiluba has also 
asked the international donor community for $10 million to 
supplement Zambia's Public Service Wage Bill. 
  President Chiluba told an International Monetary Fund 
representative in Lusaka that Zambia was looking for additional 
funds to increase the salaries of poorly paid civil servants. 
President Chiluba said the decision to forego salary increments 
for top politicians and civil servants was a demonstration of 
his government's commitment to the country's economic 
restructuring program.

<F P=106> [Report by Stephen Laufer and Anton Harber] </F>
  [Text] The aborted attempt by Minister of Defence Joe 
Modise to censor the WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN [WM&amp;G] last 
week 
revealed a titanic struggle between Modise and Defence Force 
chief General Georg Meiring for ultimate control of the armed 
forces. And a major element in this battle is information that 
Military Intelligence [MI] operatives claim to have that would 
compromise individual ANC leaders. 
  Meiring took the initiative last Thursday when, with some 
last-minute arm-twisting, he pushed Modise into the interdict 
against this newspaper. Sources close to the Ministry of 
Defence say the general won Modise over with the threat of major 
political damage to the ANC and the government through the 
revelation of highly placed South African moles in the ANC, 
dating back to its period in exile. 
  This has raised fears that such information could give the 
military a hold over some ANC leaders, including ministers and 
deputy ministers. 
  Said one intelligence source: "Meiring is a sharp 
strategist. 
He would have known all the implications of the interdict and 
may have been testing Modise." 
  But neither of them banked on the strong reaction they 
faced. 
In a move unprecedented in South African politics, the 
minister's own party, the ANC, and its alliance partners, the 
South African Communist Party and COSATU [Congress of South 
African Trade Union] all criticised him sharply and publicly. 
  Modise won back some ground in a crisis meeting on Monday 
morning when he ordered Meiring to withdraw the affidavit, 
blamed him for the criticism he had faced and over-rode Meiring 
when he did not want to concede the newspaper's legal costs. 
Modise is now taking steps to surround himself with civilian 
and political advisers, such as his long-standing colleague 
Ronnie Kasrils, to ensure he does not rely directly and solely 
on Meiring's advice. 
  Observers are now watching to see if Modise is able to 
follow 
this through and assert his authority as civilian and political 
leader of the military. 
  This leaves the question of what, if any, compromising 
information the military gathered in its decades of fighting the 
ANC that it can now use. Government and ANC intelligence 
operatives believe a decades-long programme to recruit agents 
inside the ANC by the South African spy services was ultimately 
successful in penetrating the top echelons of the political and 
military wings of the organisation. 
  The South Africans allegedly used "false-flag operations", 
in 
which they pretended to be British, American, Israeli or Soviet 
agents gathering information and won over ANC leaders 
sympathetic to those governments. At a later point, they would 
reveal to their source that they had been supplying information 
to the apartheid government, thus compromising them and forcing 
them to continue supplying material. 
  The South African intelligence operation was allegedly so 
successful that at least one cabinet minister and one deputy in 
the present government are alleged to have been South African 
informants. This newspaper is aware of the alleged identities 
of the two, but will not publish their names without conclusive 
proof of any collusion with the apartheid authorities. 
  Intelligence analysts are sceptical about claims from the MI 
operatives interdicted along with WM&amp;G last week. "They are 
too 
junior to have run or even had knowledge of really senior ANC 
figures working as agents for the other side," said one. Modise 
appears to have acted with little reference to his advisors, 
instead trusting Meiring's advice. Contacted by this newspaper 
on receipt of the interdict last Thursday, the minister's 
political advisor asked somewhat sheepishly to have a copy of 
the court papers faxed to the ministry. 
  The debacle, commented Institute for Defence Policy 
director Jakkie Cilliers, "illustrates the need for the Defence 
Ministry to seek policy advice from outside, from a 
parliamentary defence committee, from civil society, and other 
advisors. The minister should not depend solely on the generals 
for guidance." 
  The interdict debacle was a prime argument for the rapid 
establishment of the truth commission, argued several government 
sources. "It will create an ordered framework for dealing with 
the past and reduce the risk of blackmail to the government or 
leading political figures," said one. 
  It is understood that President Nelson Mandela received an 
extensive counter-intelligence briefing by the ANC's security 
department prior to choosing his cabinet. Sources refused to 
divulge what the president was told, but said "he is a lawyer. 
You must be careful not to come to him with circumstantial 
evidence, he demands proof". 
  And one cabinet insider said: "Craig Williams left a network 
behind inside the ANC (when his cover was blown). Some might 
now be in politics and positions of influence. The way out for 
poor Modise is to recommend to the president the publication of 
the Steyn report" into the DCC's [Directorate of Covert 
Collection] activities. 
  Mandela angrily told viewers during his televised 
pre-election debate with FW de Klerk that the then president had 
refused to show him the Steyn report. Repeated requests to the 
President's Office this week failed to produce clarity on 
whether Mandela had seen the report since coming to power. 
  Modise has been criticised for going into overdrive in 
implementing Mandela's reconciliation policies within the 
Defence Force at the expense of senior Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear 
of the Nation, MK -- ANC armed wing] cadres waiting to be 
appointed to the Defence Force. He is known to have built a 
close relationship with Meiring and other senior staff members 
through months of integration talks. 
  Besides spending hours together at the negotiating table, 
the 
former adversaries visited submarines and soldiers, had braais 
and beers together. Some angry MK cadres this week pointed to 
Modise's failure to get a single senior ANC military officer 
appointed to the top echelons of the SANDF [South African 
National Defence Force] since taking office. 
  Among those waiting in the wings is MK chief of staff 
Siphiwe 
Nyanda, tipped to take Lieutenant General Pierre Steyn's old job 
as chief of staff. Expected during Modise's first week in 
office, it is understood Nyanda's appointment has been delayed 
by resistance from Meiring and his colleagues, who say the MK 
man is not qualified. 
  Modise's critics counter that he should nevertheless have 
shown sufficient resolve to appoint Nyanda, even if only to send 
him for advanced staff officer training. They believe Modise is 
reluctant to ruffle the general's feathers not least because he 
has been seduced by the status and privileges available to the 
minister of defence.

  [Text] Pretoria June 17 SAPA -- Executive powers were being 
transferred to South Africa's nine provinces with immediate 
effect, Public Service and Administration Minister Zola Skweyiya 
said on Friday [17 June]. 
  The administration of almost 800 regional laws was involved. 
The transfer included almost all laws dealing with housing and 
health. The provinces would also receive almost all the laws 
administered by the now-defunct TVBC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, 
Venda, Ciskei] states and self-governing territories. 
  "The transfer of such major executive powers to provincial 
governments represents a significant step towards bringing 
government to the people," Dr Skweyiya told a press conference 
in Pretoria. 
  All the powers vested in the administrations of the four 
former provinces, the TBVC states and the self-governing 
territories were temporarily transferred to the central 
government two weeks ago. 
  The constitution lays down that the provinces will execute 
certain exclusive powers in the areas of urban development, 
local government, nature conservation and roads, among others. 
It is these powers that are being transferred. In addition, 
there are other powers which are exercised jointly by the 
provinces and central government, such as policing powers. 
These second-phase powers would be transferred to provincial 
governments as soon as possible, Dr Skweyiya indicated. 
  He said education laws were in the process of being revised 
and that the education powers of the former provinces were not 
yet being transferred to the provinces. However, the education 
powers of the former TBVC states and self-governing territories 
were being transferred. 
  "The remainder of the executive powers to be executed by the 
new provincial governments will be transferred to them as soon 
as possible. Substantial amendments to these laws, however, are 
required before any transfer can be affected. Significant 
progress has been made in this regard. "The transfer of these 
executive powers to the new provinces will have to be 
accompanied by a restructuring of the relevant government 
administrations. This is being attended to." 
  He said the deployment of powers between national and 
provincial governments constituted one of the fundamental 
aspects of the new constitution. 
  Dr Skweyiya has been consulting provincial premiers and 
public service corps around the country for the past month.

  [Text] Durban June 16 SAPA -- The African National Congress 
in KwaZulu/Natal will boycott the first sitting of the 
Provincial Assembly if it is held in Ulundi, ANC Legislature 
Member Mike Sutcliffe said on Thursday [16 June]. He was 
responding to a recent decision by the Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP], which holds the majority in the legislature, to hold the 
sitting in Ulundi between June 28-30. 
  Dr Sutcliffe said the interim constitution designated 
Pietermaritzburg as a provisional capital, and "under no 
circumstances are we going to Ulundi". He said it was 
"unconstitutional and unilateral" of the IFP to decide on Ulundi. 
  Earlier this week, the three ANC MECs [members of the 
executive committee] boycotted an Executive Committee meeting in 
Ulundi, following calls by their organisation to refrain from 
acknowledging Ulundi. 
  Dr Sutcliffe said the capital issue, and the ANC's full 
response to the IFP decision, would be discussed at an ANC 
caucus meeting on Friday. He said legislators should decide on 
the capital in an unemotional way, and consider what was in the 
best interests of the people and the province. 
  Earlier the ANC warned of a constitutional crisis in the 
province if the capital issue was not resolved. The ANC said 
the province could not be governed effectively without 
"provincial unity".

  [Text] Durban June 16 SAPA -- The African National Congress 
was determined to rule every part of the country and would use 
its national majority to break the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], 
ANC MP Peter Mokaba warned on Thursday [16 June]. Addressing 
hundreds of supporters at a June 16 commemoration rally outside 
Durban City Hall, Mr Mokaba issued the warning in response to a 
dispute about the siting of KwaZulu/Natal's capital. 
  The ANC would use its national majority to "break" the 
Inkatha Freedom Party if the IFP tried to do the same to the ANC 
in the province, he said. It should co-operate with the ANC if 
it did not want to see its leader, minister of home affairs Mr 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, "packing his bags for home". 
  "We were determined to march to Ulundi...but not as the 
capital." 
  The problems of KwaZulu/Natal were of national importance 
and 
the ANC was "determined to rule every part of the country". 
  ANC MEC [member of the executive committee] for roads, 
transport and traffic control Mr S'bu Ndebele told the crowd 
Ulundi was impractical as a capital because it was far from 
major urban areas. 
  The ANC favours Pietermaritzburg. 
  Local South African Communist Party leader Dennis Nkosi told 
the crowd: "Every student, every worker, every man and woman, 
young and old, must become part of the fight to make sure 
Pietermaritzburg becomes the capital." 
  Three ANC MECs boycotted an Executive Council meeting at 
Ulundi this week and the party has vowed to boycott a month-end 
meeting of the provincial legislature. 
  Durban Management Committee chairman Mr Peter Mansfield 
suggested his city as a temporary capital until the dispute was 
resolved, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio 
news reported.

  [Text] Pretoria June 16 SAPA -- The newly elected Volkstaat 
Council Chairman Johan Wingard said in Pretoria on Thursday [16 
June] the inauguration of the council was one of the most 
important milestones in the history of the Afrikaner people. "A 
statutory body has been constitutionally created by law to 
reconcile the Afrikaner's quest for freedom and 
self-determination with the realities of the social, economical 
and political environment of southern Africa," he said in his 
inauguration speech. 
  He told the 20-member council that the constitutional 
development and democratisation of the sub-continent would not 
be complete until the self-determination aspirations of the 
Afrikaner people had been resolved in an acceptable manner. 
"The council is not a divisive organisation aimed at upsetting 
the relative peace and harmony that currently exists in the 
country. On the contrary, its key function will be to remove 
the uncertainties that exist with Afrikaners, political parties, 
the state and...the local and international community," he said. 
  He said the council had no alternative but to fulfil its 
task 
in delivering meaningful recommendations for new legislation, 
"so that internal peace would exist and the Afrikaner could 
reach its full potential in Africa in the fields of defence, 
agriculture, medical services, mining, engineering, law, 
finance, education, and science. 
  Mr Wingard said the whole community would benefit by an 
"acceptable political solution for the problem of the 
Afrikaner's claim to self-determination". 
  The council -- which would be independent of party political 
organisations -- requested all parties, societies, bodies and 
individuals to make written or oral submissions to it. "The 
process will be open and transparent," Mr Wingard said.

  [Text] Cape Town June 16 SAPA -- Azapo [Azanian People's 
Organization] will not hesitate to take up arms against the 
government of national unity if it restricted political freedom, 
said Jomo Kwodi, deputy president of the Azanian Students' 
Congress, the student wing of the Azanian People's Organisation. 
Mr Kwodi was addressing a small crowd of supporters at Azapo's 
June 16 commemoration rally in Guguletu in the Cape peninsula on 
Thursday. 
  Many of the speakers at the rally condemned the government 
of 
national unity and committed Azapo to struggle for what they 
termed true political rights, Cape-based TANIS [expansion 
unknown] news agency reported. 
  Another speaker at the rally, Azapo's political commissar Mr 
Mzukisi Madlavu, condemned salaries that were paid to members of 
parliament. "MPs have no right to earn wages that exceeds those 
of skilled public servants, while some of them have no specific 
duties." He said the money could be effectively used to help 
the Reconstruction and Development Programme.

  [Text] Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi will 
today personally investigate statements about the police made by 
Winnie Mandela, deputy minister of art, culture, science, and 
technology. 
  A statement released by Mrs. Mandela's office said that she 
had received an offer of protection from the old apartheid 
structures, but that she preferred to be protected by ANC 
bodyguards. She did not want entrust her life to a system that 
was out to destroy her. 
  A spokesman from the Ministry of Safety and Security 
yesterday said in response to a question that the process was 
underway to resolve Mrs. Mandela's issue. Since Mr. Mufamadi 
had been at a cabinet meeting yesterday, he would only be able 
to handle the matter today. 
  Responding to questions of whether the safety of President 
Nelson Mandela and other ministers could be left in the hands of 
the police, whose effectiveness a deputy minister was disputing, 
and whether the police were completely exempted from all 
responsibility regarding Mrs. Mandela's safety, the spokesman 
said he did not have the authority to elaborate on the matter.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H8>
  Defense Minister's Actions -- The Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL 
&amp; 
GUARDIAN in English uses its editorial on page 30 of its 17-23 
June issue to draw conclusions from Defense Minister Joe 
Modise's recent attempts to interdict a WEEKLY MAIL report. The 
first conclusion is that military intelligence "is riddled with 
some of the country's most unsavoury characters" and that change 
in the military must start with "the exposure of their past so 
that these operations can be cleaned up and put on a new 
footing." A second conclusion is that Modise "is going to have 
to assert his civilian authority and end his reliance on advice 
and information from the defence force chiefs." The editorial 
also notes that the episode shows the danger that some 
politicians and members of the new government may be subject to 
pressure from the military, which has been collecting "dirt" on 
them for many years. "This provides a strong argument for a 
Truth Commission that forces into the open any information which 
may compromise individuals and institutions." The editorial 
concludes with the argument that "these events should make us 
less complacent about allowing old censorship laws to remain on 
the statute books.... Reform of these laws is a matter of 
urgency." 
<H8>  NEW NATION </H8>
  Steyn Report on Intelligence Activities -- "An intriguing 
and 
worrying web of secrecy is being spun around the investigation 
conducted by General Pierre Steyn into the activities of the 
SADF's [South African Defense Force] military intelligence arm, 
the Directorate of Covert Collection." So begins an editorial 
on page 8 of Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on 17 June. The 
editorial says it does not understand why the whereabouts of the 
report should be kept secret. "This week it was almost 
impossible to establish for sure whether in fact a written 
report exists at all. Former president FW de Klerk's office 
tells us it certainly does not exist. It was an internal 
investigation that did not warrant a written report, he said." 
The editorial goes on to note that "it is almost 18 months 
since General Steyn completed his investigations. And there has 
yet been no finding one way or another on the contents of the 
report. Neither the police nor the Attorney-General has 
commented on its contents -- whether it contained baseless 
allegations or whether it added weight to suspicions about third 
force violence....It is about time we are told where 
investigations are -- whether they have ceased or whether they 
are still continuing. Without openness and transparency in 
matters such as these, there can be no basis for reconciliation." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  New Homeland Council -- An editorial in the Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on page 10 on 17 May considers the 
establishment of a homeland council: "The establishment of a 
Volksstaatraad [homeland council] and the presence of First 
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki as a speaker at its inauguration in 
Pretoria's Ou Radsaal yesterday were an encouraging sign that 
South Africans are beginning to come to terms with their 
diversity....The ANC, in going along with the Volkstaat council 
idea, might be stalling for time in the hope that fears and 
prejudices will abate as the country prospers. Mbeki played his 
part yesterday in a generous acknowledgement of Afrikaners' 
patriotism. Such conciliatory gestures could bear fruit while 
the council searches for a formula to provide some sort of 
Afrikaner autonomy that would not compromise the integrity of 
the South African state." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  16 June Holiday -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English in an 
editorial on page 10 on 17 June argues that "June 16, 1976, 
taking everything into account, should be a public 
holiday....The sad truth is that whether you were the oppressor 
or the oppressed, this day affected all of us in the same 
drama-filled fashion. Its effects will also not disappear 
because they are part of South Africa's history." The editorial 
concludes by saying that although the current period of 
transition may not be the right one in which to declare the day 
a holiday, "any incumbent regime must be convinced that June 16, 
1976, was a turning point in the history of South Africa" 
  Fuel Price Increase -- "The remarkable thing about this 
week's petrol price increase is the equanimity with which it has 
been accepted by all," begins another editorial on the same page 
of the SOWETAN. "The question remains: Who is taking up the 
cudgels on behalf of the working people and consumers who will 
bear the brunt of the increase?" 
<H8>  BEELD </H8>
  Mandela's OAU Speech Praised -- A "new voice...on behalf of 
Africa" is how the editorial on page 8 of Johannesburg BEELD in 
Afrikaans on 15 June sums up President Mandela's recent speech 
at the Organization of African Unity summit in Tunis. "It is a 
voice that puts forward Africa's case to the world, but also one 
that castigates and speaks candidly about the continent's 
glaring offenses and shortcomings." It is a long time, says 
BEELD, since someone directed such a frank address to the 
continent as when Mandela said there is nothing wrong with the 
people of Africa, but with its their leaders. "In Mr. Mandela, 
Africa has a leader with stature, one who is governing the 
country with a potential for success. This new situation could 
indeed become the catalyst to reverse Africa's image as a 
marginalized continent which risks being written off." South 
Africa, therefore, will have to prove that it will not end up 
the same way as so many African countries have. "To set that 
example to Africa presents an exceptional opportunity to every 
South African." 
  Right-Wing Politics -- Another editorial on the same page of 
the paper notes: "The latest dispute between the Freedom Front 
and the Conservative Party [CP] over the manner of negotiations 
for an Afrikaner homeland [volkstaat] comes as no surprise. 
The agreement before the election on establishing a volkstaat 
council -- entrenched in the Constitution -- has been one of the 
most significant breakthroughs which made the participation of 
the Freedom Front in the election and in the constituent 
assembly possible. On that basis the majority of right wingers 
rejected the CP and voted for the Freedom Front, giving General 
Constand Viljoen a mandate to bargain for a volkstaat through a 
volkstaat council. Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg and the non-democratic 
diehards again want to hijack the negotiation process -- spurred 
on by the unfortunate kiss of life given to them by President 
Nelson Mandela....The rejected CP leaders should not be allowed 
to hijack the negotiation process for their own racist, 
political gain." 
  PWV Premier Praised -- Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans 
publishes an editorial on page on 14 June that says: "Since 
becoming premier of the Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging 
[PWV] province six weeks ago, Mr. Tokyo Sexwale has not made one 
wrong step. He has not been put off by the fact that his 
government has no budget and fundamental executive powers. 
Especially impressive was his action last week at Modderbee 
Prison when he went in alone to negotiate with the rioting 
prisoners.... During the past weekend Mr. Sexwale, in shirt 
sleeves and no tie, paid a second visit to the violence ravaged 
East Rand residential area. He is on the right track; he must 
keep it up."

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko by </F>
unidentified correspondent on 16 June; place not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Correspondent] The country is 
currently headed by an interim head of state whose term of 
office has only three months to run. The three months are about 
to end on 12 July. What will happen if the choosing of the new 
head of state takes longer? Has any other path been planned? 
  [Kanyenkiko] The Constitution provides for that. The first 
term ends on 12 July, however, should any problems arise, we 
hope that the concerned parties will have reached an agreement 
before that date. If that proves impossible, the Constitution 
provides that the Constitutional Court can prolong the current 
term. However, in view of the way things are progressing, we 
believe that we shall not have to do that. 
  [Correspondent] There has been tension here in Bujumbura 
recently. Some people believe this is because there are weapons 
in the country, while others think it is due to the absence of a 
head of state. What are your views? 
  [Kanyenkiko] The two things have nothing in common. You are 
aware that the people in possession of weapons should know that 
the government is currently in the process of disarming them. 
That is the way to restore peace in the country. Currently, as 
we have heard, whether in rural Bujumbura or Kayanza, the 
security forces are disarming them and the security forces are 
winning. For example, today those who fled rural Bujumbura are 
returning home. The other thing that everyone should know is 
that anyone bringing weapons into your vicinity is your enemy if 
he shoots at security forces attempting to disarm him, 
especially if a shootout ensues between them and some people are 
killed in the cross fire. What we would like people to know is 
that their enemies are those who bring weapons into their 
vicinity; that when there is fighting, people die or flee and 
their homes, are burned or destroyed. The people must denounce 
them and report them. They are their real enemies.

  [Text] The eight Guinean senior officers who were arrested 
at the end of last week were released, today, Thursday. 
According to the Guinean interior minister, the reports of a 
coup bid are totally unfounded. We have a report from Nicolas 
Balique: 
  [Balique] Official sources in Conakry said this morning that 
the reports of a coup bid were, I quote, totally unfounded. On 
the other hand, the arrest a week ago of a dozen or so senior 
officers was confirmed, without the reason behind this being 
given. Among these officers was Commander Oulare, the deputy 
chief of staff of the air force, and Captain (Noumbouya), in 
command of the battalion of airborne troops. They were released 
today, Thursday, and it has even been pointed out that this 
afternoon one of them was due to lead the battalion with the 
task of welcoming President Lansana Conte back from the OAU 
[Organization of African Unity] summit. 
  In fact these arrests are reported to have followed a secret 
meeting held by the group of officers, the subject of which was 
basically political, while it is noted in Conakry that a 
military man has an obligation to remain apolitical. It is 
impossible to establish whether a coup plan was indeed being 
considered. The release of the eight men may confirm the 
regime's desire to take the heat out of the situation 
[dedramatiser la situation] and to avoid the sound of boots 
being heard in Guinea once again.

  [Text] Pretoria June 16 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela 
was "not keen to be an additional person" trying to resolve the 
conflict in Rwanda, he told a media conference at the Union 
Buildings in Pretoria on Thursday [16 June]. With three 
experienced presidents already trying to mediate in the conflict 
it was not advisable to bring in a newcomer, he said. It had 
not been possible for him to mediate in the situation because of 
the large number of bilateral meetings in which he had 
participated while in Tunisia for the Organisation of African 
Unity's summit. However, he would like to hear what the various 
Rwandan parties had to say. 
  Mr Mandela said the cabinet had decided to provide 
humanitarian aid to Rwanda through medical assistance and funds. 
  South Africa had been asked to supply 50 armoured personnel 
carriers with drivers to the United Nations for use in Rwanda 
"but this will have to be investigated", the president said. 
  Several churches in South Africa had raised supplies for 
Rwanda. 
  Referring to Angola, President Mandela adopted a similar 
stance to that on Rwanda, saying "as a newcomer I cannot take 
over initiatives started by others". President Joachim Chissano 
of Mozambique had already assisted Angola. 
  Mr Mandela said he had met Mr Chissano, Angola's President 
Eduardo dos Santos and President Mabuto Sese Seko of Zaire on 
Wednesday. "It seems there is a realisation that they (Angola) 
should form a government of national unity," he said. 
  Intervention in Lesotho was also being investigated by a 
task 
force appointed to investigate the situation in that country. 
"We are discussing the matter and co-ordinating with the 
secretary- general of the UN, the secretary-general of the 
Commonwealth and the OAU," Mr Mandela said. "As soon as our 
investigations are completed we will announce the decision," he 
said.

  [Exceprt] Bujumbura, 17 Jun (AFP) -- A French soldier was 
shot dead overnight by a guard on duty in front of the former 
royal palace here, Burundian military sources said Friday [17 
June]. The death of the unidentified non-commissioned officer, 
who was killed overnight Thursday, was confirmed Friday by the 
French defence attache's office here. The office said a probe 
had been opened. It refused to give details of the shooting but 
stressed it had been "neither a political nor an anti-French 
act." 
  The Burundian sources said the soldier was a training 
advisor 
for the Burundian presidential guard and had been killed after 
failing to heed warnings from guards as he headed toward the 
palace in a drunken state. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Gabonese Government has taken tough measures 
against Omar Bongo Univeristy students, who have been on strike 
since 26 May. On 14 June, this strike degenerated into acts of 
violence, during which the students molested the rector as well 
as his deputy, and ransacked the rector's office. Reacting to 
this situation, the government, through Higher Education 
Minister Rene Ndemezo'Obiang, announced various measures. It 
closed down the university as of this morning, expelled four 
students, and ordered all students to vacate the campus. The 
striking students, who belong to the Front of Radical University 
Students and Gabonese University Students Union, are considered 
the organizers of the recent acts of violence. The government 
has also decided to prosecute student leaders and revise the 
university franchise laws. These measures were taken to avoid 
the recurrence of such acts of aggression on the campus in the 
future.

  [Text] In Rwanda, the fighting has resumed, though it is 
reported to be less intense. The calm we reported yesterday in 
fact only lasted for a few hours. Monique Mas asked Paul 
Kagame, the RPF's [Rwandan Patriotic Front's] chief of staff, 
why the cease- fire has been violated. 
  [Begin Kagame recording, in English with superimposed French 
translation] The cease-fire that was discussed in Tunis was 
broken just a few hours after it was announced. This is because 
we had agreed to stop shooting on the condition that the killing 
stop and that the government forces stop holding the civilian 
population hostage. 
  The cease-fire was therefore violated because it had been 
barely announced when government forces and militiamen abducted 
children from the Sainte Famille church and murdered them. I do 
not know what cease-fire we are now talking about. [end

  [Excerpts] The French foreign minister, Mr. Alain Juppe, 
yesterday announced that France is going to intervene militarily 
in the Rwanda conflict, together with its European and African 
allies. Mr. Juppe announced that France will send in 2,000 to 
3,000 of its troops currently in Somalia. This, he said, will 
be done ostensibly to stop the massacres in Rwanda, and in the 
event the OAU brokered cease-fire is not implemented. 
  Mr. Juppe's utterances have left the whole world wondering 
whether France has taken over the role of the United Nations and 
the OAU, because the action seems unilateral. What has surprised 
the world even more, however, is the irony of this pretend 
action by France, since the French Government is directly 
responsible for the massacres and genocide that have taken 
place, and are still taking place, in our country. In the past 
and in the present, France has aided the Rwanda dictatorial 
clique directly. The very people who are killing men, women, 
and children in Rwanda have got the support of the French 
Government. 
  Even before the armed conflict in Rwanda broke out, France 
was training the Rwanda Government forces, who have had a major 
role in the killings in Rwanda. Mr. (John Kabonera), a 
Frenchman and human rights activist, recently lamented that it 
was shameful for France that its Rwandese military cadres were 
the very ones who killed, raped, and looted in Rwanda. To use 
Mr. (Kabonera)'s words, it is a pity our students are the ones 
doing all this. 
  Immediately after the outbreak of the war in 1990, France, 
committed to the murderous regime, sent to Rwanda troops to prop 
up the regime against the onslaught of the superior, better 
organized RPF combatants, who not only had a just cause, but 
were sure to expose the French backed dictatorial clique to the 
Banyarwanda [Rwandans] and the rest of the world. Alongside its 
legionnaires, France supplied millions of dollars worth of arms 
and ammunition to the Kigali clique, but all this to no avail. 
France went into an all-out diplomatic war against the RPF on 
behalf of the Kigali murderers and lobbied for the Kigali 
clique, but as expected the Rwandese people and the 
international community did not pay heed to France's 
machinations on behalf of the murderers. 
  The French troops in Rwanda then intensified their military 
campaign on the frontline alongside the Rwanda Government 
forces, but lost heavily at the hands of the RPF combatants. 
The French legionnaires in Rwanda man roadblocks in the 
country, identifying Tutsis, anti-government Hutus, or arrests 
and harrassments. 
  The French troops in Rwanda, along with government forces, 
trained the dreaded Interahamwe [Republican National Movement 
for Democracy and Development, MRND, militia], armed them to the 
teeth, and posted them throughout the whole country in 
preparation for the present day holocaust. The French 
legionnaires in Rwanda raped Rwandese women and were allowed to 
carry themselves around in the undisciplined manner that 
characterizes them, as if it is the payment for the support of 
the murderous clique of MRND-CDR [Coalition for the Defense of 
the Republic]. It is common knowledge that French troops in 
Somalia, who Mr. Juppe claims will come to Rwanda, raped and 
misbehaved in Somalia and may be responsible for the animosity 
accorded to UN troops by Somalis. 
  Despite its obvious support for the murderous clique, the 
French Government pretended to moderate talks between the RPF 
and the Rwanda Government. But because the French Government 
was not genuine, the talks failed, until finally the OAU and the 
rest of the international community openly categorized France as 
a party to the conflict, and therefore not credible as a peace 
talks organizer. The talks were then organized by the OAU, with 
the blessing of the UN. France was not, of course, happy, and 
although it had observer status at the Arusha peace talks [words 
indistinct] in August 1993, France backed the late Habyarimana 
in all his moves to block the implementation of the Arusha 
accord. 
  France helped to arm and train Interahamwe militias, and 
supplied millions of dollars worth of arms and ammunition to the 
Habyarimana clique, and this is what facilitated the murderous 
Interahamwe to carry out the genocide and massacres in Rwanda. 
Even after the death of Habyarimana, France rushed to evacuate 
the family and close associates of the late president. 
  France was the first country to recognize, and granted visas 
to, Jerome Bicamumpaka and Jean-Bosco Barayarwiza, who are known 
killers, and who had left instructions at home that hundreds of 
thousands of innocent lives [words indistinct]. 
  France is still supplying arms through the Rwanda Embassy in 
Cairo to the murderous clique in Rwanda, as evidenced by fax 
messages from Cairo to Rwanda. [passage omitted] 
  Having said this, it is very clear that France is incapable 
of making the situation in Rwanda better. The only thing it can 
achieve is to aggravate the situation. France cannot stop the 
genocide and massacres it has helped to put in action. France 
is the mentor of the very clique which is carrying out the 
killing. 
  The only way it can stop the killing is to [words 
indistinct] 
its support for the murderers. Why should France undermine the 
UN and OAU? The UN and OAU should make their stand clear, and 
show that they are world bodies with authority. They should not 
allow France to marginalize them. The intentions of France are 
very clear. France intends to fight for the murderous extremist 
clique calling itself government, which is on the run, in the 
pretext of stopping massacres. 
  After hundreds of thousands of innocent lives have been 
lost, 
the French Government, which is responsible for this loss of 
life, now claims it will send in troops to stop the killings. 
The intention is clear: The French troops will come to protect 
the murderers. The French minister claims that France will come 
with its European and African allies. One wonders who these 
allies are. 
  France has always been alone and on the wrong side as 
regards 
the Rwanda question. It is not about to get allies now. 
Whatever allies it will get, it cannot in any way replace the 
UN and the OAU. It will still be a unilateral action by France. 
Whatever action [word indistinct] France takes, will not 
absolve France from its contribution to the genocide and 
massacres which took place, and are still taking place, in 
Rwanda today. France has no moral authority [word indistinct] 
to intervene in the conflict in Rwanda.

  [Text] Kigali, 17 Jun (AFP) -- Rwandan rebels captured 
Kigali's key Sainte-Famille church complex from government 
forces early Friday [17 June] after an intense battle, a UN 
military spokesman said. The Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic 
Front (RPF) rebels took control of the church from Hutu-led 
government soldiers and Hutu militia, said Major Jean-Guy Plante 
for the UN mission here. The RPF success came after intense 
fighting despite a ceasefire announced Wednesday in Tunis at the 
closure of the Organisation of African Unity summit.

  [Text] Nairobi, 17 Jun (AFP) -- Rwandan rebels freed about 
400 civilians in a commando raid early Friday [17 June] on a 
church behind government lines where militiamen are believed to 
have abducted and killed hundreds of people, a UN spokesman 
said. A spokesman for the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) 
said initial reports by a UN spokesman that the rebels had 
captured the Sainte- Famille church complex were based on "Army 
propaganda". "They want to massacre everyone there so that's 
why they're saying we're in control," said the spokesman, 
Colonel Frank Mugambage. 
  UN spokesman Pierre Mehu said a commando group of about 10 
RPF fighters had freed 400 civilians trapped in the church for 
more than two months around three A.M. (0100 GMT) Friday while 
other rebels created a diversion nearby. Mehu confirmed that 
the rebels had not, as initially believed, captured the church, 
where several thousand more civilians, including minority Tutsis 
and Hutus, are still stranded. 
  Hutu militiamen have abducted from the church and murdered 
hundreds of Tutsis and Hutus suspected of backing the opposition 
or the mainly Tutsi rebels. In the latest atrocity, militiamen 
abducted and probably killed 60 children and adolescents from 
the church Tuesday after preventing UN soldiers from evacuating 
them to safety. Up to half a million people have been butchered 
in Rwanda's 10-week bloodbath, triggered by the April 6 death of 
president Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, in a presumed rocket 
attack on his plane.

  [Text] In Rwanda, very violent fighting broke out in the 
capital, Kigali, this morning. There were exchanges of 
artillery, mortar, and machine-gun fire between the government 
army and the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] rebels. The UN 
soldiers on the spot were forced to suspend the evacuation of 
civilians trapped by the fighting. Talks on a cease-fire were 
expected to resume today. 
  In the capital, Kigali, eyewitnesses say that there is 
hand-to-hand fighting in the city centre. The RPF has in any 
case taken control of the Sainte Famille Church. Earlier, a 
shell hit the church, injuring 40 people. It was in this church 
that 60 adolescents took refuge and from which they were 
abducted [on Tuesday] and probably massacred by Hutu militiamen.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interim President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya </F>
by unidentified correspondent; place and date not given -- live 
or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Interim President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya has 
returned from Tunisia, where he took part in the OAU meeting of 
heads of state and government. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Concerning the authorities that you 
met--these included the Rwandan authorities. Does meeting the 
Rwandan Government authorities mean recognition by Burundi? 
  [Ntibantunganya] Burundi is trying to find ways to bring the 
warring parties together because we know that the two sides are 
fighting. What we want is for the two sides to understand one 
another. We also asked for a meeting with the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front [RPF], but a meeting was not possible. What we want is to 
listen to all sides, and then to try to discover what can help 
them understand one another, in order to end the war. No one 
can support massacres. 
  The second thing is that if the war in Rwanda continues, it 
could adversely affect our region. No leader in our region can 
overlook this. At the meeting of the heads of state of our 
region we invited all the parties, the RPF and the Rwandan 
Government, in order to listen to them. Even at the OAU level, 
there are heads of state who expressed the wish to come so that 
we could listen to them, but that wish was not realized.

  [Text] Kigali, 17 Jun (AFP) -- About 30 Hutu militiamen on 
Friday [17 June] attacked a hotel housing hundreds of Tutsi 
refugees and sprayed gunfire into the rooms after chasing UN 
troops away, a UN military spokesman said. The attack on the 
Milles Collines hotel by extremist gunmen from the Hutu majority 
came hours after the mainly Tutsi rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front 
launched a commando raid and brought some 400 people out of a 
church where hundreds of people have been killed by Hutus. The 
UN spokesman, Major Jean-Guy Plante, said he could not give any 
casualties from the raid on the hotel, but said it was "probably 
murderous". 
  Both the hotel and the church are on territory in the 
embattled capital held by Hutu pro-government troops and militia 
forces. In the Tutsi raid on the church, other rebel forces 
started firing to create a diversion, and 180 wounded civilians 
and soldiers, believed to have been hurt in the ensuing 
fighting, were admitted to a Red Cross hospital. 
  Two UN officers, one from Bangladesh and the other from 
Uruguay, were hurt in what was believed to have been a grenade 
or mine explosion Friday about 20 kilometres (12 miles) 
north-west of Kigali during a reconnaissance mission on the road 
to the town of Ruhengeri, UN military sources said. No further 
details were immediately available and it was unclear who was 
responsible for the explosion. Fighting erupted despite a shaky 
two-day-old ceasefire between rebel and government forces.

  [Text] One UN soldier was killed and another one wounded on 
Friday [17 June] when they were traveling near Shyorongi where 
fighting was taking place between Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] 
forces and government troops. 
  The RPF had earlier warned the UNAMIR not to use 
Kigali-Ruhengeri road without the consent of the RPF forces, but 
contrary to the warning the UN officers went through the roads. 
Their vehicle ended up landing in an ambush where fighting was 
taking place. The RPF soldiers fired at the vehicle and on 
coming closer found it was UN soldiers. 
  One officer, a major by rank, died instantly and one more 
was 
injured. The injured was given first aid and later taken to 
hospital.

  [Excerpt] Kigali, June 19 (AFP) -- A young Rwandan woman 
was killed and three others were injured when three shells fell 
on the Red Cross hospital in the centre of Kigali Sunday [19 
June], as France continued preparations for sending an 
international intervention force to protect civilians from the 
conflict. 
  Philippe Gaillard, head of the Kigali delegation of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), said one shell 
fell on a hospital building, another one near by and a third 
close to a wing where 50 orphans were sheltering. 
  The hospital, the only medical centre in the government-held 
sector of the city, has around 600 patients -- "injured people 
who can't walk and can't be moved," Gaillard said. 
  The Tutsi-led rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) 
intensified 
its shelling of the town centre Sunday, a UN spokesman said. 
The rebels had seized control of Mount Kigali, a hill 
overlooking the south-west of the town, he added. 
  Wounded men, women and children lay helpless on stretchers 
or 
plastic sheets outside the hospital Sunday. The medical team of 
three Doctors and five nurses is running out of bandages and 
places to put their patients, Gaillard said. 
  Gaillard said he had pleaded with the RPF to stop shelling 
the hospital but was rebuffed. The RPF told him the hospital is 
within the government-held zone and that government forces are 
in position in the hospital's immediate surrounds, he said. 
  The rebels continued their advance in the rest of the 
country 
Sunday towards Butare in the south and Kibuye in the west. 
General Romeo Dallaire, commander of the UN Assistance Mission 
in Rwanda said he was "surprised" at the speed of the RPF's 
advance. 
  The rebel movement seized the town of Gitarama, a former 
government hold-out situated between Kigali and Butare, a week 
earlier. 
  In Kigali, the UN had attempted to persuade the warring 
factions to observe a truce for a few hours to allow the 
evacuation of civilian refugees from the Sainte-Famille church 
building. The evacuation of displaced persons in the rebel-held 
sector was set to occur simultaneously. 
  On Saturday, the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) 
had 
stepped up its evacuation of civilians trapped in Kigali on 
either side of the front line, with six convoys from the 
Mille-Collines hotel in the government-held sector and from the 
King Faisal hospital in rebel territory. 
  The Mille-Collines hotel is now empty and UNAMIR now plans 
to 
resume evacuations from the hospital as well as the 
Sainte-Famille church, UN spokesman Major Jean-Guy Plante said.

<F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>
  [Excerpts] Kigali, 20 June (AFP) -- Fierce battles raged on 
in the Rwandan capital Monday [20 June] as France stepped up 
diplomatic efforts to persuade rebels not to oppose planned 
French-led military intervention to end the carnage. "There is 
a lot of fighting, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) is putting 
the Army under heavy pressure but it is defending itself very 
well," UN military spokesman Major Jean-Guy Plante said. 
  In France, military sources said that the Central African 
Republic, located to the northwest of Rwanda across Zaire, would 
serve as an operational platform for the operation France hopes 
rapidly to mount. The RPF strongly opposes French intervention 
in Rwanda, arguing that Paris armed the government army and 
helped train extremist militias from the Hutu majority accused 
of slaughtering hundreds of thousands of minority Tutus. 
  The mainly Tutsi rebels are laying siege to Army positions 
in 
Kigali, but Plante said the United Nations Assistance Mission in 
Rwanda (UNAMIR) had "not noted a significant change in the 
positions of one side or the other." The fighting was 
particularly intense in Kigali city centre, in the southwest of 
the city and around two military camps in the north and east. 
On Sunday night, the sky over the city was streaked with flares 
and tracer bullets, while the sound of rocket launchers 
thundered from the surrounding hills. 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Sunday that French 
officials would begin contacts this week with Rwandan Government 
officials and with Rwandan guerrilla representatives in New 
York. He told French television station TF1 on Sunday that "we 
are making a great efforts to convince the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front that this operation is not aimed against them." Juppe has 
also stressed that his plan was humanitarian and ruled out going 
alone or without backing from the UN Security Council, but so 
far only Senegal has made a concrete pledge of sending troops to 
join the French. 
  Italian Defence Minister Desare Previti headed for Paris on 
Monday, as the daily REPUBBLICA published an interview in which 
he said Rome would join in a military operation in Rwanda, but 
only if the deployment was based on an international accord. 
  Military sources in France said French troops, numbering 
from 
1,000 to 2,000 men, would be stationed in countries bordering on 
Rwanda, probably Zaire and Tanzania, but would not fly into 
Kigali for security reasons. The sources said the operation 
would be "strictly neutral" and also ruled out neighbouring 
Burundi for the deployment of troops, since it too has a Hutu 
majority and Tutsi minority, with a history of ethnic strife. 
[passage omitted] 
  An informed source in Paris said the planned French 
operation 
would begin in an area where Tutsis are under threat. Tutsis 
were said to make up about 15 percent of the population of some 
7.5 million before the latest bloodletting claimed up to 500,000 
lives. The United Nations said Monday it was hoping that 
fighters would observe a truce so that civilians sandwiched 
between the front lines could be evacuated. Such operations 
were interrupted Sunday because of ferocious fighting. 
  A UN plan to reopen Kigali Airport, closed for the past two 
weeks, on Sunday came to nothing after officials failed to 
obtain written security guarantees from the government forces, 
Plante said. Last month, the RPF seized the airport which is 
also the base for the Ghanaian contingent of the UN mission, 
which is currently using Uganda's Entebbe Airport to receive its 
supplies and humanitarian aid which is then trucked into Rwanda. 
[passage omitted] 
  Juppe and other French officials have indicated that any 
French- led operation would be a limited one preceding the UN 
redeployment. Military sources said troops would come from 
France and from French bases in the Central African Republic, 
Gabon, Cote d'Ivoire or Djibouti.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Paul Kagame, leader of the rebel </F>
Rwandan Patriotic Front, by Renaud Girard in Byumba; date not 
given: "Kagame Still Distrusts France"] 
  [Text] [Girard] Alain Juppe is envisaging French 
intervention. What is your reaction? 
  [Kagame] I have heard your minister's statement. I do not 
understand exactly what he is demanding. I do not see how an 
intervention of the kind he is considering could improve the 
situation. If France wants to do what we are doing itself, it 
would be better if it left us to do it. 
  [Girard] Do you not actually fear that the arrival of French 
soldiers might prevent you from continuing your action? 
  [Kagame] France's involvement in the Rwandan conflict has 
been proved. It has clearly shown that it is partisan. The 
return of its soldiers here would merely complicate matters. 
  [Girard] French policy has nonetheless changed from 
Mitterrand to Balladur. 
  [Kagame] In Rwanda, France has taken sides since the 
beginning of the war in 1990. This partisan spirit has 
continued over the past few months. I have not noticed any 
change of French policy. It has given its support to the 
so-called interim government, this regime of militiamen, and 
Rwandan officials have recently been received in Paris. France 
has not openly condemned the interim government for the crimes 
it has committed in Rwanda. And if France now wants to do 
something here, it would do better to wait for us to invite it. 
  [Girard] The French are nonetheless not responsible for the 
genocide of which Rwanda has been the theater since 7 April, 
when President Juvenal Habyarimana was assassinated? 
  [Kagame] It is obvious that the French are partly 
responsible 
for what has happened. France trained the militias and the 
Army. It has not condemned the assassins. 
  [Girard] What role would you agree to the United Nations 
playing in your country? 
  [Kagame] The United Nations can pursue its humanitarian 
mission, its aid to the populations that have survived the 
massacres. This is the maximum that the United Nations can 
achieve here. The Blue Helmets have shown themselves to be 
incapable of protecting the civilians who are being murdered by 
the militias. At present, I do not see who they could aspire to 
save by military means. 
  [Girard] Do you support the Security Council's decision to 
send 5,000 additional Blue Helmets to Rwanda? 
  [Kagame] It is a question which still has to be debated. 
First, the United Nations must clearly define its mission. Only 
then will we be able to tackle the question of the number of men 
likely to accomplish that mission effectively. 
  [Girard] But once the United Nations has clearly defined its 
humanitarian mission, you would not oppose the dispatch of these 
reinforcements? 
  [Kagame] General Dallaire (head of UNAMIR, the UN Assistance 
Mission in Rwanda) is in fact demanding 5,500 Blue Helmets. We 
think that is a large number. We are currently negotiating to 
arrive at a reasonable figure. 
  [Girard] What figure do you advocate? 
  [Kagame] The same sort of number that UNAMIR had when the 
war 
resumed in April, in other words, around 2,500 men. But the 
United Nations must first have a clear humanitarian mandate. 
What it lacks in this crisis is not numbers but a mandate. 
Otherwise the United Nations would have been able to protect 
the civilians from the start of the massacres. The Blue Helmets 
have always told us that they did not have a mandate to do so at 
the time. 
<H5>  `Minimizing Losses in Our Ranks' </H5>
  [Girard] Your movement, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], 
was known for its discipline. But the archbishop of Kigali was 
murdered by the RPF men who were guarding him. What is your 
explanation? 
  [Kagame] We still maintain very strict discipline in our 
movement. But this does not rule out some loss of control, 
individual crimes. You have blunders of this kind in all 
armies, even those of the developed countries. 
  [Girard] Will those responsible be prosecuted? 
  [Kagame] Of course. One of the assassins was killed when 
resisting arrest. Three others are on the run. We are actively 
seeking them. I will arrest the officer commanding the unit in 
question. He is not directly responsible for what happened, but 
as chief he is responsible. 
  [Girard] What is stopping you from capturing Kigali? 
  [Kagame] We are taking our time. We are making plans to 
minimize the losses in our ranks. 
  [Girard] Do you still refuse to negotiate with the interim 
government while agreeing to have discussions with the military? 
  [Kagame] Yes. But the FAR (Rwandan Armed Forces) have 
disappointed us. They do not keep their promises. Scarcely was 
the cease-fire signed than the massacres resumed and the 
civilians were prevented from going to the area of their choice. 
The general staff told us that they did not control the 
militias. But how can anybody think that professional soldiers 
are unable to control militiamen armed with machetes?

  [Excerpts] Following a short lull yesterday, fighting 
resumed at dawn today in the center of Kigali with RPF [Rwandan 
Patriotic Front] forces shelling several positions held by 
government forces. [passage omitted] 
  The RPF has repeated its position that it opposes French 
intervention in Rwanda. Paul Kagame, the RPF military leader, 
said this earlier this morning when he spoke to Christophe 
Boisbouvier: 
  [Begin Kagame recording, in English fading into French 
translation] We intend to oppose the French intervention in 
this conflict by all means available to us because of the role 
played in Rwanda by the French in the past. We believe that 
they want to intervene for reasons other than those they claim, 
and we believe that UN forces on the ground can fulfill the 
mission the French want to carry out. 
  I think their presence here is going to have an escalating 
effect on the conflict; they are claiming that militias and 
government forces are murdering civilians, but they supported 
the so-called interim government responsible for all the 
massacres, so they are simply coming here to protect these 
people. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The French Government is once again ready to add 
to her acts of perfidy in the Rwandan tragedy. [passage omitted] 
  During the whole genocide process, which began on 7 April 
with the genocide perpetrated by the students of the French 
Army, the French Government kept silent. Here she is now 
shouting massacre, at a time when genocide has already been 
committed. 
  For those who know the harmful consequences which always 
come 
with the cruel intentions of so-called cooperation -- if not the 
complicity of France with the bloody Rwandan regime, there is no 
possible doubt that the French Government is once again 
attempting to give active military support to the Rwandan 
Government Army's acts of genocide. The French Government has 
certainly noted that defeat was shame for the Rwandan Government 
Army, so France wants to give a helping hand to this Army. 
  The RPF, with the backing of Rwandans tired by dictatorship, 
is determined to fight anyone who sheds and continues to shed 
Rwandan blood. Should the French Government cling stubbornly to 
its backing for the criminals, the Rwandan people and the RPF 
are determined to defend themselves until victory is reached. 
We really think that the French people will not stay idle for 
long in the face of the countless evils committed by their 
government against the Rwandan people.

  [Excerpts] A French delegation made up by Bernard Kouchner 
and Gerard Larome was in Byumba yesterday, and held talks with 
General Paul Kagame, commander in chief of the Rwandan Patriotic 
Army [RPA]. At the end of the meeting, the French Government 
representative, Mr. Larome, gave an interview to our colleagues, 
(Innocent Huhito) and (Tito Mbasha). The Paris envoy begins the 
interview by explaining the purpose of his mission: 
  [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Unidentified 
correspondent] You said that your mission was to see how to 
assist orphans, and to meet with General Kagame. However, I 
would like to ask you about France's present role -- what is the 
exact role of France over the Rwandan issue? 
  [Larome] The first role is, as far as is possible, to press 
the United Nations to intervene on a larger scale and in a more 
consistent manner in Kigali, to stop the massacres of children, 
women, and civilians, who have been killed with impunity. 
Minister Juppe made a declaration yesterday in France, after 
having agreed with his (?European counterparts), with Mr. Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali of the United Nations, that we press for a rapid 
intervention, if the need arises, under the aegis of the UN flag 
in Kigali. 
  [Correspondent] With a humanitarian mission or intervention? 
  [Larome] The troops must first be on a completely 
humanitarian mission, that is to say they should be able to 
protect the people they are guarding and to supply them with the 
food and drug convoys which we are already managing to bring to 
Kigali, though under extremely difficult conditions. 
  [Correspondent] Is this in the framework of the United 
Nations, or will it be at France's own initiative? 
  [Larome] The role of France on the present issue [word 
indistinct] usual African partners, is to press the United 
Nations to intervene in the most efficient manner possible. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Brussels, June 18 (AFP) -- Rebels of the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front (RPF) called on Rwandans at home and abroad 
Saturday [18 June] to "mobilise" against a French initiative to 
send a humanitarian intervention force to Rwanda. 
  "Mobilise to bring down the French treason plan. You are 
Rwandan, you must live or die in Rwanda and not elsewhere," RPF 
politburo member Jacques Bihozagara said in a statement issued 
here. 
  The appeal to "general mobilisation" also called on "African 
countries which want to follow France in carrying out its 
sinister plan" to think again. 
  "Maybe you have debts to France, but find other ways to 
repay 
them than with Rwandan blood," the statement said. 
  Earlier in the day, French President Francois Mitterrand 
told 
a meeting of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organisation in Paris that the setting up of the "humanitarian 
protection force", proposed by France, was a matter of "hours 
and days". 
  France also wants to involve other African countries in 
sending to Rwanda a peace-keeping force of some 1,000 to 2,000 
soldiers under UN guidance. 
  "Today, France, rounding off its plan, flies to the rescue 
of 
the executioners on the run," the RPF statement also said, 
speaking of France's alleged support for the embattled 
Hutu-dominated Rwandan government. 
  The head of the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] bureau in 
Brussels, James Rwego, said the text was a "call to take up arms 
against France on Rwandan territory." 
  If French troops went to Rwanda, they would be considered "a 
hostile force," he told AFP. 
  He said the statement had been drawn up after consulting RPF 
officials in Rwanda.

  [Text] Mortar fire resounded across Kigali before dawn 
today. Heavy fighting has resumed, and small arms fire can be 
heard in the streets of the Rwandan capital. The RPF [Rwandan 
Patriotic Front] rebels are currently aiming for the 
administrative district of the city. They already hold part of 
the capital, and they are resuming the offensive to control the 
whole country. This is how we will protect the Tutsis: we do 
not need France, they repeat, even threatening France. This is 
what Jacques Bihozagara, RPF spokesman in Brussels, had to say 
to Anne-Marie Mouradian: 
  [Begin recording] [Bihozagara] The RPF agreed to 
humanitarian 
intervention, but we do not want a mission which is imposed upon 
us. For a long time, we have been opposed to a French presence 
among the blue helmets. We now see that France has decided on 
war. 
  As you know, there was a Security Council resolution that 
defined the framework for intervention by the international 
community. Now France wants to go in alone, or with its friends 
or its acolytes. France is currently mobilizing African 
countries, in particular French-speaking countries, some of 
which are not all that independent from France. We consider 
French intervention as an act of provocation, and therefore we 
will meet it with the appropriate means. 
  [Mouradian] By armed force? 
  [Bihozagara] Yes, of course. We are quite ready for a trial 
of strength, and, as I said, we are prepared to make use of all 
the means at our disposal. If we must all die, then we will 
die, but I think France will also have to pay a heavy price.

<F P=106> [Interview with RPF spokesman Dr. Jacques Bihozagara by C.B. </F>
in Brussels; date not given] 
  [Text] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] is opposed to 
France's planned intervention. RPF Political Bureau Member Dr. 
Jacques Bihozagara, whom we questioned, repeated that to us 
bluntly: 
  [Bihozagara] The answer is no! France is not qualified to 
carry out this kind of operation for several reasons. First, 
because we think that France was aware of, if not an accomplice 
of, the plans for genocide: The training of the commandos was 
carried out by the French, it is they who supplied them with 
weapons; 80 percent of the weapons we have seized from the 
government forces have been supplied by the French. 
  The Interhamwe [Coalition for the Defense of the Republic 
Militia] were divided into three categories: Demobilized 
members of the Presidential Guard, who had kept their weapons, 
commandos, trained by French soldiers, and ordinary peasants who 
had been given weapons. Today the genocide plan has been 
carried out: Two thirds of Rwanda's Tutsis have been 
exterminated as well as 90 percent of the Hutu intellectual and 
political elite. 
  We also think that France is not qualified because we have 
information that it participated in the attack on the 
president's plane. From the start, we said that the plane's 
black box was in Paris and nobody has denied this. But the 
information from the black box has never been analyzed or 
released. 
  [Braeckman] Are there still civilians to be saved? 
  [Bihozagara] Yes, and the RPF is capable of doing it. We 
also note a change in the Rwandan Army's attitude to the 
militias: When the latter burst into the Hotel des Milles 
Collines, it was the government army which intervened against 
them. In addition, we have noted conciliatory remarks about the 
RPF from the chief of staff and we know that the government 
troops are demoralized. We have the feeling that the Rwandan 
Army is not ready to do what is necessary to release the 
hostages and it is at this precise moment, when things could be 
resolved, that France wants to make a gesture. 
  [Braeckman] How can this attitude be explained? 
  [Bihozagara] There are several reasons: The first is that 
France feels a moral debt toward Rwanda, and that the government 
feels urged to do something, including to launch into the 
adventure. But we also think that among the scattered troops 
there are embarrassing witnesses who could call France into 
question and who ought to be eliminated. I would also like to 
tell you that the UN special representative who is in Rwanda 
might, during his investigations on the ground, be forced to 
implicate members of the Akazu (the president's entourage -- LE 
SOIR editor's note) who are currently in France. 
  [Braeckman] Do you have information that French soldiers are 
in Rwanda and are trapped alongside the government forces? 
  [Bihozagara] Yes, we also have reports that some French 
soldiers have been discovered in military camps in Kigali and we 
think that the current operation also has the aim of bringing 
them out. We even think that this is the decisive reason for 
the operation planned, and this is why it is necessary to move 
so quickly. France wants to cover its tracks and we oppose 
that. We have asked all Rwandans in Europe to return to the 
country to oppose this action. 
  [Braeckman] Bernard Kouchner [French state secretary for 
humanitarian affairs] is currently in Rwanda, and has passed 
through RPF lines. In what capacity? 
  [Bihozagara] When I saw him in Geneva and he told me he 
wanted to make another visit, I suggested that he went to the 
government side to plead with the militias to release their 
hostages. He had tried previously but the militias had refused 
and he returned empty-handed. 
  He has now returned to Rwanda, passing through the North, 
but 
he was there on a private basis and was accompanied by Mr. 
Larome, who is in charge of humanitarian operations. 
  If we refuse France's intervention it is also in memory of 
our country's countless victims. We also refuse the 
intervention of former French colonies with excessively close 
ties with Paris, like Togo for instance. As for Senegal, we 
agreed to its participation in a UN intervention, which we still 
accept, but if the Senegalese return alongside the French, as 
[French Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe is asking them to do, that 
is a different matter.

  [Excerpts] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] chairman, 
Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, has just addressed a message to the 
Rwandan people, to the friends of Rwanda and the entire 
international community, to brief them about the situation 
currently prevailing in our country, particularly the 
interference of France, which has decided to send an occupation 
force to our country. Please listen to the message of the RPF 
chairman, Col. Alexis Kanyarengwe on the matter. 
  [Begin Kanyarengwe recording] Rwandan ladies and gentlemen, 
since 6 April 1994 Rwanda has been living in an unprecedented 
tragic situation. Unbelievable criminals from the Republican 
National Movement for Democracy and Development [MRND] and the 
Coalition for the Defense of the Republic, and their respective 
militias the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi, with a faction of 
the government forces, including the Presidential Guard, 
inflicted on the Rwandan people unimaginable atrocities. 
[passage omitted] 
  The RPF would like to stress that it is not against the UN 
efforts for humanitarian assistance to Rwanda. We, however, 
make it clear that the RPF must be associated in the choice of 
countries participating in the UN mission. No country can 
participate in the said mission without prior acceptance by the 
RPF, otherwise it would be considered as an enemy. It is also 
important to note that the humanitarian mandate of the UN 
mission as provided for by Resolution 912 of the Security 
Council must be clearly defined and strictly respected as such. 
  Concerning the recent statement of the French minister of 
foreign affairs on the French intervention in Rwanda, we are 
surprised that France has decided on military intervention in 
our country, while knowing very well that the RPF has always 
opposed the presence of French troops under whatever pretext. 
After the general outcry and indignation caused by the 
statement, the French government (?is busy) seeking the approval 
of the Security Council and of the various partners, by 
disguising its project as so-called humanitarian intervention in 
Rwanda. But this can fool nobody. The French president wants 
at all costs to save those responsible for the crime of genocide 
under the guise of a humanitarian action. [passage omitted] 
  Once more, the RPF strongly protests this French initiative, 
which it considers as a provocation. And in the event of such 
an intervention, we reiterate our firm determination to defend 
ourselves against what we consider as an enemy aggression. 
[passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] The leaders of political forces of change, 
Republican Democratic Movement [MDR], Liberal Party [PL], Social 
Democratic Party [PSD] and Christian Democratic Party [PDC] have 
sent an open letter to the French president, Francois 
Mitterrand, condemning the decision of sending French troops to 
Rwanda. 
  In the letter, the political leaders said they were 
surprised 
by President Mitterand's decision of sending French troops in 
Rwanda at a time when the United Nations has been trying to 
expand its force in the country. The president was reminded that 
when French troops were sent in Rwanda in 1990 when the war 
between the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and government forces 
had just begun, they did not stop the imprisonment of over 
10,000 innocent people and that at that time, killings of Tutsi 
were sanctioned in almost all prefectures especially Ruhengeri, 
Gisenyi and Kibuye, and the French troops did nothing to stop 
the killings. 
  The letter goes on to say that since 1973, the French 
Government has supported the dictatorial regime in Rwanda which 
is responsible for the killing of hundreds of thousands of 
Rwandan people, including opposition leaders. France is the 
only country supporting the illegitimate government which 
assumed power on 9 April this year, and the French Government 
has refused to accept that the leaders of this illegitimate 
government are the ones responsible for the killings, when human 
rights organizations have already condemned these killers, the 
politicians told President Mitterrand. 
  The letter goes on requesting the French president to 
abandon 
sending troops to Rwanda on the note that the French troops 
presence will be aimed at supporting the killer government and 
that France will have shown betrayal to the Rwandan people and 
the international community. France should instead help in 
setting up an international tribunal to bring to justice the 
criminals and should also avail the black box of the late 
President Habyarimana's plane to help in carrying out 
investigations. 
  The letter to the French president was signed, on behalf of 
the PSD by the party president, Rugenera Marc and Rwangabo 
Pierre-Claver, for PDC Nayinzira Jean-Nepomucene, first vice 
president, for PL Joseph Nsengimana, and for MDR by Sixbert 
Musangamfura.

<F P=106> [Article by Colette Braeckman: "The Rwandan Plane Shot Down </F>
by Two Frenchmen?"] 
  [Text] While French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe is saying 
that France is prepared to mount an intervention on Rwandan 
soil, "to protect the groups threatened with extermination," 
information has reached us casting suspicion on two French 
soldiers in the attack on [former] President Habyarimana's 
plane, which took place on 6 April. 
  A report from Kigali, which is consistent on some points 
with 
the current state of the investigation being carried out in 
Belgium by the military prosecutor's office and which is 
consistent with other information in our possession, asserts 
that the plane carrying President Habyarimana and Cyprien 
Ntaryamira, his Burundian counterpart, was shot down by two 
French soldiers from the DAMI [Military Training Assistance 
Detachment], serving the CDR [Coalition for the Defense of the 
Republic]. The CDR are the extremists of "Hutu power" accused 
of having spearheaded the subsequent massacres. It was French 
soldiers from the DAMI who remained in Kigali until last 
December, before being replaced by the UNAMIR [UN Assistance 
Mission in Rwanda] Blue Helmets which include 450 Belgian 
paratroopers. However, some DAMI members were seen in Kigali 
again in February. 
  The report states that these two French soldiers put on 
Belgian uniforms to leave the area and were seen by two soldiers 
of the National Guard. Hence the official accusation, 
reiterated by the Rwandans, against the UNAMIR Belgians who were 
present at the airport. Only four CDR officials were informed 
of this plot against President Habyarimana's plane. This report 
is consistent with other information, gathered in Rwanda during 
the withdrawal of expatriates and in Brussels where the 
investigation of the military prosecutor's office, opened after 
the death of 10 Belgian paratroopers, is being continued. 
  It now seems almost certain that the plane was shot down by 
a 
portable missile, probably a Soviet-made SAM of the Strela 
series. Such weapons are not rare in Africa, they are found in 
Uganda, but also in Angola, and others, from Eastern Europe, 
have been sold on the private market. However, all the Belgian 
and foreign aid workers and observers think there is no question 
that the two rockets which downed the plane could have been the 
work of Rwandan soldiers: They have never been trained in that 
kind of exercise. The hypothesis most frequently cited so far 
was that of unidentified "mercenaries." It also seems, and we 
were confirmed this on the spot, that the fire came from a place 
called "Massaka," which is situated behind the Kanombe military 
camp, where the Presidential Guard was posted. In the three 
days which followed the attack, all possible witnesses were 
liquidated. More than 3,000 people were thus eliminated in the 
area around Massaka by the Rwandan paratroopers from Kanombe 
camp. 
  How could the perpetrators of the missile fire have procured 
Belgian paratrooper uniforms? As easily as anything, 
apparently: The Belgian Blue Helmets were in the habit of giving 
their laundry to the Hotel Meridien and they were often 
surprised to find that pieces of their uniform were disappearing. 
  Other indications seem worrying to the investigators, for 
instance the fact that when the plane from Dar es Salaam was 
approaching Kigali, the control tower several times asked who 
was on board the plane, notably finding out about the presence 
of the Burundian president. 
  However, it must be pointed out that the airplane crew was 
French and that Major Jacky Heraud, Colonel Jean-Pierre 
Minaberry, and Chief Warrant Officer Jean-Marie Perrinne, the 
mechanic on board, perished alongside the two heads of state and 
their fellow passengers. 
  This possible involvement by two French soldiers in the 
attack on [former] President Habyarimana's plane raises 
essential questions: In what framework did they act? Did they 
operate as mercenaries? What was the motive for such an act, 
which launched the killings, plunging Rwanda into an 
unprecedented tragedy? 
  Given the present information, it is virtually certain that 
the Rwandan president, who was under strong pressure to accept 
the Arusha agreements, had finally given way during the meeting 
held in Dar es Salaam by President Mwinyi, Tanzanian "mediator," 
and was preparing to deliver a speech on radio on his return to 
Kigali, announcing the formation of a broadly based transitional 
government, including five Patriotic Front ministers. This 
implementation of the Arusha agreements, making provision for 
power sharing, annoyed the regime's "hardliners" who had long 
planned [former] President Habyarimana's elimination if he 
showed weakness. 
  There have also been questions about the extent to which the 
president's family, and more especially his in-laws, were 
informed of these plans by the extremists. The report we have 
received from Kigali states that the president's family was not 
informed.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 17 Jun (AFP) -- Rwandan Interim President 
Theodore Sindikubwabo stated today in Kinshasa that there were 
no "militiamen" in Rwanda, but rather "resistance fighters" 
fighting invaders. 
  One of his advisers also stated at a press luncheon that 
what 
"the Western media are calling militia," comprise "resistance 
forces, like the one in France, which just celebrated the 50th 
anniversary of its liberation." 
  Mr. Sindikubwabo, the ministers of foreign affairs and 
health 
who accompanied him, and several advisers, stated that Rwanda 
was the victim "of Ugandan aggression," which according to them, 
is supporting and arming the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF, Tutsi 
minority rebels). They also accused "certain Western press" of 
taking only the viewpoint of the RPF into account. 
  The participants also said Belgian troops from the United 
Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) were present at 
Kigali airport during the 6 April attack on the plane carrying 
the Rwandan and Burundian presidents. 
  "Kigali airport was in the hands of UNAMIR and other 
elements, most of whom were Belgian troops," Mr. Sindikubwabo 
stated. He pointed out that the aircraft's black box "could not 
be found by the Belgian troops, and that it was not in the hands 
of the UNAMIR," without giving further details. Mr. 
Sindikubwabo and his delegation, who were on their way back from 
the OAU summit in Tunis, also expressed satisfaction with that 
meeting, as well as their desire to see the establishment of "a 
frank and sincere dialogue" with the RPF, so as to find a 
"political compromise" to the Rwandan situation.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 18 June (PANA) -- Rwanda's interim 
president, Theodore Sindikubwabo, said Friday [17 June] in 
Kinshasa that the current "activism" of the Rwandan militia is a 
"resistance movement by the youth and the whole population 
against foreign aggression". 
  Sindikubwabo, who was the guest of the Press Club of the 
Zairian section of the International Union of French-Speaking 
Journalists (UIJPLF), however, acknowledged "the possibility of 
extortion and murders" by the youth, adding that his government 
has taken all precautions to "control the resistance and avoid 
aggression". 
  Explaining the reason that led "the Rwandan youth to defend 
themselves", the Rwandan president alluded to a secret document 
by rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) calling for "the 
demolition of broad-based institutions to install the RPF, and 
the elimination of all republicans". 
  For the Rwandan president, back from the 30th OAU summit in 
Tunis, the government he leads came in to fill the vacuum left 
by the death of President Habyarimana. 
  The government, he added, is working for an end to the war. 
He said this would allow for a dialogue on the basis of the 
Arusha political compromise, humanitarian assistance and the 
setting up of institutions. 
  Speaking about the situation on the ground, he expressed 
reservations about reports that the RPF had taken the town of 
Gitarama. Intense fighting is taking place in the area but 
there is no proof that the town has fallen to the rebels. He 
blamed the multiple violations of Rwanda's cease-fire on RPF 
elements whom, he said, are "massively supported by Uganda. The 
truth cannot be otherwise," he said, "given that the Tutsi are a 
minority and can only fight on foreign support". 
  To questions on his relations with President Yoweri Museveni 
of Uganda, he replied that he "just shook hands with the Ugandan 
head of state in Tunis". "The only time we spoke was when I 
asked the Ugandan president for his guarantees to the 
effectiveness of the cease-fire at the meeting of the committee 
of the 11 states of the sub-region. He replied that the 
cease-fire should not be subject to conditions" 
  On a new foreign intervention to try and end the crisis in 
Rwanda, the president [words indistinct] "give priority to 
dialogue", and called for "moral and diplomatic aid". 
  "Any intervention is welcome if it allows a cease-fire and 
does not punish some (Hutu) and save the Tutsi (minority)," he 
added.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 19 June (PANA) -- High-ranking Burundi 
Government officials, mainly from the majority Hutu ethnic 
group, spend the night in Uvira, a small town in the Zairian 
province of South Kivu, near Bujumbura. 
  "Early in the morning, these officials return to their 
offices in Bujumbura to perform their duties", the ZAIRE NEWS 
AGENCY (AZAP) correspondent reported from Uvira Friday [17 June]. 
  The influx of Burundian refugees to the small town near Lake 
Tanganyika has created an acute shortage of accommodation. 
Hotels of the area are overbooked, said the local correspondent 
of AZAP who also spoke of insecurity problems arising from the 
presence of the top Burundi Government officials in Uvira. 
Reports indicate that up to 10,000 Rwandan refugees and 70,000 
from Burundi have flocked into South Kivu so far.

  [Text] Pretoria -- Defence Minister Joe Modise had met some 
of the former Military Intelligence [MI] agents who had 
threatened to divulge sensitive information and was considering 
their demands for restitution, Military Intelligence Acting 
Chief of Staff Maj-Gen Dirk Verbeek said yesterday. 
  The agents, calling themselves the Group of 23, were gagged 
last week by the Transvaal Supreme Court following an urgent 
interdict by Modise against them and the WEEKLY MAIL. The 
interdict was withdrawn by Modise this week. 
  According to court papers, he feared that the disgruntled 
former Directorate of Covert Collection spies would make public 
names of their former informants. These were believed to 
include senior Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC 
military wing; MK] officers who are in line for high-ranking 
posts in the new SA [South Africa] National Defence Force 
[SANDF]. 
  In an earlier letter to President Nelson Mandela, the group 
urged government to redress their "unfair dismissal" from the 
former MI front company Pan Afrik Industrial Investment 
Consultants (PAIIC). They asked that they be re-employed by 
the SANDF, or that they be paid compensation, despite having 
received retrenchment packages equivalent to 18 months' salary 
tax free. 
  The former spies also wanted to be cleared for any alleged 
third force activities following a Goldstone commission raid on 
PAIIC's offices and a subsequent statement by former President 
FW de Klerk in 1992. De Klerk's statement resulted in 11 MI 
members being placed on early retirement and the closure of the 
front company. Forty-nine PAIIC employees were retrenched and 
the front company closed. 
  Verbeek said Attorney-General Jan D'Oliveira's 
investigations 
after Goldstone's raid had failed to produce any evidence of 
criminal activities in the ranks of the directorate. 
  He said that only four of the spies had identified 
themselves. 
  Verbeek said that although MI was still involved in covert 
operations outside SA, the directorate no longer had any front 
organisations in SA.
