<F P=106> [Article by Louise Flanagan and Chandre Gould] </F>
  [Text] Defence Minister Joe Modise has inherited a covert 
intelligence-gathering unit -- the Director of Covert Collection 
[DCC] -- riddled with dirty tricks operatives from the total 
onslaught era. 
  Last week Modise moved to interdict the MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN 
[WM&amp;G] from publishing further details about the workings of 
the 
DCC, which was partially purged after being raided by Mr Justice 
R Goldstone in late 1992. 
  Since last week Modise has improved on his technique in 
dealing with the press. When the WM&amp;G asked the military to 
confirm that 62 people had been members of the DCC he both 
responded to our request and called a press conference on 
Thursday after the newspaper's deadline. 
  A long-term investigation has established that: 

  -  The DCC's director is Brigadier Horace William Doncaster, 
alleged former head of the Johannesburg City Council spy ring. 
  -  Second in command Colonel Gerry Borman was the handler of 
former CCB [Civil Co-operation Bureau] Transvaal chief Staal 
Burger. 
  -  Two of its operatives were still collecting information on 
the 
ANC and the Pan Africanist Congress as late as March this year. 


    The DCC contains former Rhodesian security agents, one of 
whom worked for the South African Military Intelligence [MI] 
unit responsible for running Renamo [Mozambique National 
Resistance] and Unita [National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola]. 
  -- One of its key front companies, Pan Afrik Industrial 
Investment Consultants (PAIIC), is apparently still operating, 
despite South African Defence Force [SADF] assurances a year ago 
that it was being de-registered. 
  A Defence Ministry spokesman said the company was currently 
in the final stages of being wound up, but did not explain the 
delay. 
  The Goldstone raid unmasked the DCC head office front 
company 
Africa Risk Analysis Consultancy (Pty) Ltd (Arac). A year later 
the M&amp;G exposed PAIIC, which was used to employ 62 DCC 
members. 
As happened with the military's now disbanded Civil 
Co-operation Bureau [CCB], these people were ordered to "resign" 
from the SADF and work for PAIIC so that their connection with 
the SADF would be hidden. 
  About 20 former CCB members were hired by PAIIC. This 
enabled the 62 to operate within South Africa's borders, which 
was not part of their brief as MI agents. PAIIC catered only 
for those operating within South Africa. Operatives based 
outside the country would have fallen under other front 
companies which are still unknown. The use of front companies 
was an officially authorised strategy. 
  Former DCC member Jan Anton Nieuwoudt stated in court 
documents filed during 1993 that he joined PAIIC on the orders 
of General Joep Joubert, General Witkop Badenhorst and Brigadier 
Tolletjie Botha. 
  Immediately after the Goldstone raid then-president FW de 
Klerk announced that 23 officers had been suspended from duties 
and might face charges in relation to criminal activities. 
Despite promises by De Klerk, few further details were revealed 
and the 23 -- about half of whom have never been named, despite 
De Klerk's assurances that they would be -- simply lost their 
jobs and dropped out of sight. 
  The results of inquiries by both General Pierre Steyn and 
Judge Goldstone into DCC were never made public nor handed to 
the attorney-general's office. Nobody from the organisation was 
ever charged. At least two former DCC members, Nieuwoudt and 
Commander Jack Widdowson, sued the SADF for unfair dismissal and 
won substantial settlements. Some have quietly been given their 
jobs back. 
  A group of 23 of the PAIIC members are appealing to 
President 
Nelson Mandela to clear their names. It was the representatives 
of this group, Gerhard Jansen van Rensburg and Clive Brink, that 
Modise briefly interdicted from speaking to the press. Van 
Rensburg and Brink have emphasised that their aim was never to 
expose either their fellow officers or their sources as Modise 
claimed in the interdict. 
  "Contrary to the allegations contained in the SANDF's [South 
African National Defense Force] application for the interdict, 
we have not revealed the names or identities of sources, 
collaborators or informers of former colleagues, neither is it 
our intention to do so now, or in the future," said the PAIIC 
group. 
  "We joked about contacting our old sources (now) in senior 
positions and asking them for jobs, but decided against it 
because it's an issue that needs to be dealt with by the new 
government," said PAIIC group member Wally Wilsenach this week. 
"We are not prepared to sacrifice them for our own selfish 
gain." 
  As Wilsenach was not affected by the gag, he was able to 
talk 
to the press. He also emphasised that he would not identify 
colleagues. The PAIIC group believes their dismissal points to 
a conflict between intelligence agencies within the country. 
They allege that the Counter-Intelligence directorate 
identified them as a way of shifting attention from themselves. 
  Wilsenach claimed Counter-Intelligence had information about 
DCC members' links with MI6 and Zimbabwean CIO [Central 
Intelligence Organization] as well as information about illicit 
diamond deals and fraud. 
  The Defence Force has restricted access to the public files 
on Arac and PAIIC -- a restriction which still seems to be in 
force. More ominously, PAIIC appears to be operating despite 
official SADF claims that it closed down in February 1993. 
  Goldstone found that Arac was set up in 1988 with the sole 
director an Eric Johan Pelser. The address Pelser gave turned 
out to be false. A public register indicates that PAIIC was set 
up in January 1986 with the sole member a Ernst John Panzhorn, a 
name interestingly similar to that of Arac's director. 
  This week Penzhorn, a Pretoria lawyer, denied having any 
links to the Defence Force or any of its front companies. He 
said his legal firm had registered PAIIC during the 1980s: "If 
I am indicated as a director/member it could have been for 
purposes of initial registration only, as often happens, 
whereafter the interest in the company or CC is transferred 
after registration," he said, adding that he could not say 
whether PAIIC was still in business. 
  The public records clearly indicate that, although the PAIIC 
file is restricted, the corporation is still in business. 
Penzhorn is also named on public records as linked to MI front 
Global Capital Investments cc, which was finally deregistered in 
1992. Penzhorn says he sold Global Capital Investments as a 
dormant company during the 1980s and no longer had any interest 
in it.

  [Text] In a major blow for openness this week, the MAIL 
&amp; 
GUARDIAN [WM&amp;G] forced the South African National Defence 
Force 
[SANDF] to confirm the names of members of the shadowy 
Directorate of Covert Collection [DCC]. 
  The WM&amp;G sent the military a list of 62 individuals 
with the 
request that they should reveal their present and past 
relationship with the DCC. Yesterday the SANDF confirmed that 
11 were still working for DCC and that 36 others had been 
employees. 
  In court papers justifying the interdict against the 
WM&amp;G, 
SANDF chief General Georg Meiring last week cited the need to 
protect the identity of intelligence operatives. 
  The following are DCC members: 

  -  Director Brigadier Horace William Doncaster, who once 
allegedly headed the Johannesburg City Council spy ring. 
  -  Second in command Colonel Gerrie Borman, the senior staff 
officer for the East Front, which includes Swaziland, Tanzania, 
Uganda, Lesotho and Zimbabwe. 
  -  Pat Keyser, SSO West Front -- Botswana, Namibia, Angola, 
Zaire 
and Zambia. Kayser was formerly with the Rhodesian Central 
Intelligence Organisation [CIO] which initiated Renamo 
[Mozambique National Resistance]. He moved to SADF [South 
African Defense Force] MI's [Military Intelligence] Directorate 
of Special Tasks, responsible for running Renamo in Mozambique 
and Unita [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] 
in Angola, and later to DCC. 
  -  Colonel Gert Pretorius, SSO Foreign Intelligence Services, 
whose job is to identify threats from foreign intelligence 
agencies. 
  -  John Maudsley, now believed to be running Internal 
Collection. 
  -  Sandra Nolan. 
  -  Leon Nefdt. 
  -  Terry Scallan, based in the Eastern Cape. 
  -  Lieb Venter. 


    Also understood to be in the DCC's employ is Henri van der 
Westhuizen, responsible for intelligence on the ANC until March 
this year. After the WM&amp;G sent its list of suspected DCC 
members to the military this week, Van der Westhuizen assaulted 
a former SADF [South African Defense Force] officer he believed 
to be one of our sources. 
  Past employees of the DCC: 

  -  Brigadier Tolletjie Botha, former DCC director who lost 
his job after the Goldstone raid. 
  -  Colonel At Nel, one of Botha's deputies, who also lost his 
job. 
  -  Jean Blignaut. 
  -  Ferdi Bernard, the former CCB [Civil Cooperation Bureau] 
member 
hired by DCC between May and December 1991. 
  -  Warrant Officer Clive Brink, who once worked in Ciskei for 
Military Intelligence front organisation International 
Researchers/Ciskei Intelligence Services, whose task was to prop 
up the Gqozo regime. 
  -  Lucas Delport, now possibly working as a diplomat. 
  -  Jose D'Oliviera, an Angolan Portuguese who ran the DCC field 
office in Rundu, Namibia, and was allegedly an ivory smuggler. 
  -  Pamela du Randt, arrested by British police while allegedly 
on 
a mission to kill Dirk Coetzee. 
  -  Leon Flores, arrested along with Du Randt. 
  -  Tony Oosthuizen, who until March was responsible for 
intelligence on the PAC. 
  -  Mickey Geletti. 
  -  Deon Gerber. 
  -  Gerhard Jansen van Rensburg lost his job after the Goldstone 
raid. 
  -  Koos Louw, now a naval commander in Saldanha. 
  -  Alec West, ex-Rhodesian CIO, Colin Evans and Albie Botha, all 
rehired after the Goldstone raid. 
  -  Leon Nefdt. 
  -  Jan Anton Nieuwoudt, who trained Inkatha members at the 
Caprivi 
Strip in the 1980s and later ran the International 
Researchers-Ciskei Intelligence Services operation in Ciskei for 
DCC. He won a R220,000 [rand] payout from the SADF shortly 
before the elections. 
  -  Sandra Nolan, the administrative officer responsible for 
running key front companies. 
  -  JP Opperman, now based in the Durban field office. 
  -  Eugene Riley, who was recruited to DCC by Ferdi Barnard. He 
died under mysterious circumstances. 
  -  Jim Ross, who moved on to track down illegal diamond dealers 
for Anglo American Corporation. 
  -  An Askari [former ANC member working for the South African 
police] formerly employed by Vlakplaas commander Eugene de Kock, 
Chris Makgopa. Another Askari hired by DCC, Glory "September" 
Sedibe, died mysteriously. 
  -  Stephan Snyders, who was accused of criminal activities after 
the Goldstone raid and lost his job. 
  -  Philip Steenkamp. 
  -  Rick Verster, who was accused of criminal activities after 
the 
Goldstone raid and lost his job. 
  -  Wally Wilsenach, who lost his job after the Goldstone 
raid. 


    Army Intelligence members were also attached to DCC.

<F P=106> [By Jimmy Steepe] </F>
  [Text] The first glimpse into the report compiled by former 
South African Defence Force [SADF] General Pierre Steyn into the 
activities of the Military Intelligence's Directorate of Covert 
Collection [DCC] points to high level collusion between the 
police and the defence force. And the common link between the 
two is former Vlakplaas commander, Eugene De Kock, who is named 
in reports of the Steyn investigation as well as the Goldstone 
Commission. 
  The Attorney General of the Transvaal, Dr Jan D'Oliveira, 
told NEW NATION that De Kock's name appears in Gen Steyn's 
report as well as the Goldstone Commission reports dealing with 
Third Force violence. Gen Steyn was appointed by former 
President F.W. de Klerk to investigate the DCC following a 
Goldstone Commission raid on the directorate's offices in 
Pretoria in 1992. 
  D'Oliveira also said that activities to which De Kock had 
allegedly been linked included train and hostel violence. De 
Kock gained notoriety when he was charged with training of 
Askaris [former ANC members working for the South African 
Police] at the Vlakplaas base of the South African Police in the 
1980's. 
  "We are investigating various incidents of violence in the 
train and hostels that could be tied-up together with De Kock's 
activities," D'Oliveira said. 
  "There are certain similarities appearing in the Steyn and 
Goldstone Commission reports which we are investigating". 
  "We have a large number of things which we are looking at 
which De Kock might have been involved in," he said. "Incidents 
of train and hostel violence feature high up in the 
investigation". 
  Meanwhile, mystery surrounds the whereabouts of the complete 
report compiled by Steyn into the DCC. Lawyers say that in 
terms of procedure the report should have been handed to the 
then State President F.W. de Klerk. 
  But De Klerk's spokesperson, Richard Carter, told NEW NATION 
that no such report existed in the Deputy President's office. 
Carter said the former president was briefed "verbally" about 
the findings of the commission but because it was an "internal 
matter" it did not warrant a written report. 
  Questions about Steyn's report first came to light when 
President Nelson Mandela asked De Klerk to hand him the report 
during a television debate shortly before the elections. De 
Klerk, who appeared embarrassed, told Mandela that he could not 
hand him the report because he felt it did not contain any 
sensitive information that warranted his attention. 
  However, almost 18 months after the report was handed to De 
Klerk, there has been no subsequent finding from either the 
police or the Attorney-General's office on the relevance of 
Steyn's findings. 
  Asked about the report, Steyn said he did not think it 
appropriate to comment. 
  What is known, however, is that a number of senior officers 
were suspended from duty following the report. Lawyers for 
Human Rights spokesperson, Jody Kollapen, told NEW NATION that 
he found it difficult to believe that De Klerk, who had asked 
for the investigation, did not get a copy of the report. 
Kollapen said he thought it was "standard government procedure 
that after every commission a report should be handed to the 
state president for consideration. 
  "If General Steyn was commissioned by the state president to 
conduct the investigation, De Klerk should have been the first 
person to have received his report." "I find it strange that 
someone who had commissioned a report would feel it was not 
necessary to study the finding even when further investigation 
was necessary," said Kollapen. "I do not believe that De Klerk 
was not given a copy of the report." 
  The DCC members were sacked by De Klerk following the 
Goldstone Commission raid on their offices and the subsequent 
investigation by General Steyn.

  [Text] A spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, Dr. Das 
Herbst, has denied allegations of a power struggle between the 
minister of defense, Mr. Joe Modise, and the chief of the 
National Defense Force, General George Meiring. Dr. Herbst was 
reacting to a report in the WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in which 
it 
was alleged that General Meiring had asked Mr. Modise to request 
and interdict against the newspaper. General Meiring apparently 
warned Mr. Modise that the government could be harmed if the 
names of spies in the ANC were revealed. The newspaper says it 
has forced the army to confirm the names of 47 former and 
current employees of the Directorate of Covert Intelligence.

<F P=106> [Article by De Wet Potgieter] </F>
  [Text] The ANC's determination to find out which of their 
own members spied on the movement has led to a big search in the 
shadowy world of South African spies. This could have 
disastrous consequences for the country and could prove to be a 
big embarrassment for the ANC because heads could roll in top 
government structures. Such an embarrassment could also prove 
to be a serious setback for the South African National Defense 
Force's [SANDF] three-year plan to integrate the various armed 
forces. The first visible signs of nervousness in the 
intelligence community were evident a week ago when Minister of 
Defense Joe Modise obtained a Supreme Court interdict to silence 
the WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN and two former spies of the 
Directorate of Covert Collection's (DCC) disbanded front 
organization PAIIC [Pan Afrik Industrial Investment 
Consultants]. Earlier this week, Mr. Modise withdrew his 
application. 
<H5>  Talks </H5>
  Last week, Mr. Modise held talks with the PAIIC group. 
High-level secret talks are also taking place between ANC 
intelligence officials and members and former members of SANDF 
and police concerning the sensitivity of information on the 
identity of spies in the ANC and its military wing, Umkhonto we 
Sizwe [Spear of the Nation]. The planned Commission of Truth 
and Reconciliation hangs like a sword over the heads of 
thousands of policemen and soldiers. Deputy President F.W. de 
Klerk has already publicly warned "that old wounds should not be 
scratched open." The anxious policemen are now waiting to see 
what effect Commissioner General Johan van der Merwe's 
comprehensive document on the issue to Safety and Security 
Minister Sydney Mufamadi will have. "We know that we kept the 
apartheid government in power," says a senior officer to RAPPORT 
this week, "but the ANC has also committed acts of terrorism and 
we know what they did. They also know what we did." 
<H5>  `Unacceptable' </H5>
  He added that someone like Judge Richard Goldstone would be 
totally unacceptable to the police as chairman of such a 
commission of truth. Meanwhile, the continuing rumors 
surrounding the identities of spies and former spies of the 
defense force have taken a serious turn with indications that 
former members fear that the lives of their families are in 
danger because several former informants are becoming very 
anxious, fearing reprisals. Mr. Clive Brink, spokesman for the 
PAIIC group who believe that they were unfairly dismissed, told 
RAPPORT this week: "We made it clear from the very beginning 
that we will protect the identities of these people and we even 
went as far as protecting it with our lives." This was soon 
after the acting chief of staff intelligence of the SANDF, Major 
General Dirk Verbeek, said at a news conference that the SANDF 
would have to consider taking former spies to court if they 
continue with their threats. He alleged that this group, 
serving members of the SANDF and the DCC, are making threatening 
telephone calls day and night.

<F P=106> [Article by De Wet Potgieter: "Police Boss Warns Government </F>
About Truth Commission; High Ranking Officers Probably Guilty"] 
  [Text] You are digging a hole for others. Watch out -- you 
will also fall into that hole. 
  This is the implication of a serious warning delivered by 
Police Commissioner General Johan van der Merwe this week to the 
ANC-controlled government over the planned Commission of Truth 
and Reconciliation. The commission's task is to hear 
confessions from "criminals" of the apartheid era. This could 
lead to top members of the ANC's National Executive Committee 
[NEC], as well as members of cabinet, being scorched as a result 
of terrorist activities during this period. This could be a big 
embarrassment for the ANC. 
  RAPPORT is in possession of a harshly worded document in 
which General van der Merwe issues a stern warning to the 
government over the establishment of the planned commission. 
The general also deals sharp blows to the Goldstone Commission. 
According to him the Goldstone Commission has come forward with 
wild allegations against the security forces which still cannot 
be proven in a court of law. 
  General van der Merwe also points out to government that the 
Skweyiya Commission of Inquiry warned back in August 1992 that 
"no one guilty of crimes should ever again be allowed to occupy 
an official post. If the ANC is not willing to take definite 
steps in this regard then the risk of repetition will always be 
present." 
<H5>  Names </H5>
  The document, handed to Minister of Safety and Security 
Sydney Mufamadi on Wednesday, names among others Defense 
Minister Joe Modise, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, PWV 
[Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Premier Tokyo Sexwale, 
Ministers Joe Slovo and Mac Maharaj, and Mr. Jacob Zuma, Mr. 
Siphiwe Nyanda, and Ronnie Kasrils as "the prominent members of 
the ANC implicated in certain acts of terror." 
  The commissioner's document mentions a firm commitment to 
see 
to his men in the police service. The sharp words of warning to 
the government is regarded as an urgent attempt to defuse the 
explosive situation behind the scenes and to prevent any 
irresponsible actions. 
  Certain former members of the disbanded security branch and 
serving members of the Criminal Investigation Department were 
involved in the struggle against the ANC under the old 
dispensation. All parties who participated in the struggle may 
be involved in the scuffle, to the embarrassment of all 
concerned, especially the current government of national unity. 
According to General van der Merwe, police investigations, 
evidence heard in court cases, as well as other available 
information, indicated that members of the ANC and Umkhonto we 
Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing], involved in 
the gruesome violation of human rights, did this under the 
orders of the National Executive Committee of the ANC. 
<H5>  Acts of Terrorism </H5>
  "During the 1976-1990 period at least 623 acts of sabotage, 
terrorism, murder, car bomb explosions, and landmine explosions 
can be directly linked to the ANC. In these acts of terrorism 
153 people have died, 1,158 people were injured, and more than 
20 million rands of damage caused." 
  Some of the attackers were caught and charged but others hid 
outside the country's borders. In some cases there was 
overwhelming proof that certain acts of terrorism were carried 
out by senior members of the ANC's NEC abroad, or approved by 
them. "Today these individuals occupy senior positions in 
government," according to the document by General van der Merwe. 
(The implication is that they are occupying these positions in 
contradiction with the above mentioned quote by the Skweyiya 
Commission: "No person guilty of crimes ... should ever again 
be allowed to occupy an official post.") 
  The commissioner mentions individual examples of the most 
gruesome cases: 

  -  25 January 1980 -- Silverton bank siege; 
  -  20 May 1983 -- Church Street bomb in Pretoria; 
  -  3 April 1984 -- Durban car bomb; 
  -  23 December 1985 -- Amanzimtoti bomb; 
  -  9 January 1986 -- landmine explosion in Durban; 
  -  14 June 1986 -- Durban car bomb; 
  -  Several landmine explosions in the rural areas of Transvaal 
during 1986; 
  -  20 May 1987 -- landmine explosion at the Johannesburg Court; 
and 
  -  Several attacks in restaurants and shopping centers. 

<H5>  Temporary Indemnity </H5>
  Members of the ANC's NEC are enjoying temporary indemnity 
until 17 May next year. If no amnesty is granted by 17 May then 
civil or criminal charges could be laid against alleged 
criminals. "The members of the NEC have never publicly 
apologized for the crimes they were responsible for. These 
people are, therefore, legally responsible for these acts even 
if it is just as accomplices, and in many cases as co-accused," 
says Gen. van der Merwe. He adds that it should be emphasized 
that not a single member of the ANC's NEC has thus far applied 
for indemnity, but have only been granted temporary indemnity 
from prosecution. 
  "The Commission (of Truth and Reconciliation) will lead to 
further mistrust in the South African Police Services and an 
increase in acts of violence against its members. An atmosphere 
of mistrust will prevail, affecting prominent individuals 
occupying senior positions in government. Steps will have to be 
taken to ensure that the amnesty process is not politicized and 
does not result in renewed racial conflict and acts of 
terrorism." 
<H5>  General Amnesty </H5>
  RAPPORT was told that before the elections, police officers, 
who insisted behind the scenes that government grant general 
amnesty, are waiting to see how the government reacts to the 
commissioner's report before further action is decided upon 
concerning the establishment of the Commission of Truth and 
Reconciliation. 
  General van der Merwe's document also refers to the Douglas 
Commission and the Motsuenyane Commission, who both heard 
evidence on terrible violations of human rights committed by ANC 
members while they were outside the country's borders. "These 
violations of human rights include murder, serious attacks, and 
torture," according to the document. The names of Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Alfred Nzo, Mr. Joe Slovo, Mr. Modise, Mr. 
Kasrils, and Mr. Nhlanhla, implicated in the reports of the 
above-mentioned commissions, are mentioned.

  [Text] Justice Minister Dullah Omar says plans for a Truth 
and Reconciliation Commission will go ahead despite opposition 
expressed by the commissioner of police. Police Commissioner 
General Johan van der Merwe has submitted a document to the 
safety and security minister in which he warns that the 
commission could bring about the downfall of top ANC members. 
  Johannesburg's BUSINESS DAY newspaper quoted Mr. Omar as 
saying that the government was not worried about this 
possibility and that it was no reason to suppress the truth. He 
said the ANC accepted that its members might have to appear 
before the commission.

<F P=106> [By Peter De Ionno] </F>
  [Text] Talks between Defence Minister Joe Modise and SANDF 
[South African National Defense Force] chief General Georg 
Meiring about high-level command posts for Mr Modise's former MK 
[Umkhonto we Sizwe; Spear of the Nation--ANC military wing] 
comrades-in-arms have deadlocked. 
  The impasse is embarrassing Mr Modise by frustrating the 
expectations of his closest supporters, who see the SANDF 
opposition as a last-ditch attempt to retain white control of 
the military command structure. 
  Calls for Mr Modise to exert his political authority over 
the 
generals are rising as he faces a personal test this week with a 
bid to persuade government leaders to appoint a deputy minister 
to help him restructure and re-orient the defence force. 
  Ronnie Kasrils, Mr Modise's long-term MK ally and confidant, 
is favoured for the post, if the minister can break through the 
ceiling of 12 deputy ministers. 
  Mr Kasrils, who has been attending official briefings at Mr 
Modise's side, favours moves to change the complexion and image 
of the SANDF with the appointment of black generals. He would 
give powerful support to Mr Modise in forcing the generals to 
compromise. 
  The headquarters generals are insisting on pre-election 
agreements that appointments and ranking of MK officers could 
only be based on internationally accepted military standards. 
This would exclude many veteran MK commanders. 
  Senior MK officers can claim 30 or more years of guerrilla 
warfare experience and training in African and Eastern Bloc 
military doctrine. But many do not have academic qualifications 
and the breadth of command demanded for high office by a modern 
conventional defence force. 
  A Defence Ministry source confirmed this week that an MK 
list 
suggesting 17 names for leadership posts had been sent back by 
the SANDF with a demand that it be cut to seven names. 
  While the arguments are centred on two vacant positions at 
SANDF headquarters -- chief of staff (effectively second in 
command) and chief of staff intelligence -- the outcome will 
have a direct effect on the ranking of all MK cadres being 
integrated into the defence force. 
  MK officers fear that assessment boards will not recognise 
ranks and commissions awarded in the guerrilla army. 
  The chief of staff position, vacant since the retirement in 
November of Lieutenant-General Pierre Steyn, has been widely 
expected to go to Siphiwe Nyanda, who succeeded Mr Modise as 
commander of MK. As chief-of-staff he would be heir apparent to 
General Meiring. 
  Mr Nyanda, 43, a former sports journalist who returned from 
exile in 1988 to head Operation Vula, has spent the past two 
years guiding MK towards integration, but senior SANDF sources 
reject him because "he is not qualified". 
  Similarly, attempts to moot MK's head of operations Lambert 
Moloi for the SANDF intelligence chief's post (which also 
carries the rank of lieutenant-general), are being dismissed 
"because he does not have the right background". 
  "The generals do not realise that there is a political 
imperative to make provision for our people if the military is 
to be seen to change and be seen as legitimate by the whole 
country," said a ministerial adviser. 
  "The SANDF command just cannot remain lily-white. There has 
to be political intervention and acceptance of affirmative 
action." 
  Meanwhile, initial hiccups at the Wallmannstal assembly area 
for MK soldiers being prepared for integration appear to have 
been overcome. 
  The number of MK cadres listed for integration has been 
settled at 26,864, more than double the 12,000 originally 
expected.

<F P=106> [By Cherilyn Ireton and Edyth Bulbring] </F>
  [Text] South Africa's fledgling government this week 
resisted insistent demands to become embroiled in foreign 
conflicts that would detract from its priority of domestic 
reconstruction. At the Organisation of African unity summit in 
Tunis this week, President Nelson Mandela was embraced by fellow 
African leaders as the continent's miracle-maker, forcing his 
aides to squash "exaggerated" hopes for financial aid and 
intervention in conflicts and requests that the president take 
sides in international disputes. In developments this week: 
  -- Mr Mandela resisted pressure to send SANDF [South African 
National Defence Force] troops to Rwanda or to mediate between 
the representatives of the warring government and rebel forces. 
Instead, South Africa donated R1-million [rand] to the OAU peace 
fund, and will support church efforts to deliver supplies to 
Rwanda. 
  -- South Africa declined to send troops to Lesotho despite 
three separate demands that it do so by the Frontline States, 
led by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. Mr Mugabe argued for 
military intervention at the OAU meeting, at the meeting of the 
Frontline States in Harare, and at the World Economic Forum in 
Cape Town last week. 
  -- Hopes that South Africa would mediate in the Angolan 
conflict were also squashed when Mr Mandela declined a leading 
role in this initiative. 
  -- South Africa rebuffed approaches to immediately cement 
full diplomatic ties with North Korea after the Asian country 
sent an urgent mission to the Tunisian capital. North Korea is 
teetering towards a military clash with the U.S. over its 
nuclear programme and is anxious to have South Africa on its 
side. 
  -- Officials said reparation in cash, requested by the 
Frontline States for their assistance in the war against 
apartheid, would not be forthcoming. Instead, South Africa 
would enter joint projects aimed at developing the region. 
  -- Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo tried to avoid a motion 
backing Libya in its dispute with the U.S. and the United 
Kingdom over the Lockerbie bombing being tabled at the OAU 
meeting. 
  A presidential aide said that, apart from wanting to avoid 
being drawn into energy-sapping disputes in Africa, the new 
government was also aware that, as a "newcomer", it had to be 
sensitive to other African leaders. The aide added the 
government also had to be aware of is own domestic demands 
before it committed huge resources to the rest of the continent. 
  In an interview this week, Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz 
Pahad 
outlined a pragmatic, interest-driven foreign policy with the 
chief priority of securing resources for the country's 
Reconstruction and Development Programme. 
  Addressing a press conference on the issues of Rwanda and 
Angola on his return from the OAU, Mr Mandela said: "It appears 
that leaders of countries where there is conflict would like to 
exploit the experience we have had, but I feel we will achieve 
better results if we fit in with the strategies already started, 
instead of starting our own independent initiatives." 
  He said he was willing to consider a possible meeting with 
the warring Rwandan parties -- but to listen, rather than to 
mediate. There were three other "perfectly competent" African 
leaders who were already involved in mediating the conflict, he 
added. 
  On the Angolan issue, Mr Mandela said that, while he had 
been 
asked to meet President Eduardo dos Santos and Mobuto Sese Seko, 
he would prefer to support an initiative started by Mozambique 
President Joaquim Chissano. 
  After the joy at admitting South Africa as the 53rd member 
of 
the OAU subsided, disappointment surfaced that Mr Mandela had 
not done more to bolster the finances of the OAU or the 
economies of its members. However, Mr Mandela made it clear 
that South Africa would not hand out material resources except 
to help raise living standards. 
  On several occasions he was forced to remind journalists and 
delegates that he was not the Messiah and that no individual 
would solve Africa's economic and social problems. 
  Foreign Affairs director-general Rusty Evans said in an 
interview in Tunis: "Of course they (African countries) have 
expectations...of course, in their misery, they look at South 
Africa as something that might suddenly bring relief of sorts. 
  "At the same time there is a sense of realism. The South 
African delegation has been warning against expecting too much." 
  OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said people were 
being unfair to South Africa in questioning what it would to 
strengthen the African economy. "The best contribution South 
Africa can give is to become stable and strong and it will then 
gradually impact on the continent," he said. 
  However, leading Africa analyst John Coker was critical. He 
said South Africa's R1-million contribution to the OAU peace 
fund was insignificant, in dollar terms, compared to the amount 
of funds the OAU and its members had spent aiding the struggle 
against apartheid.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad </F>
by Edyth Bulbring; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Aziz Pahad was running an hour late. He was tied up 
with representatives from the German government's development 
wing, and then another man, Mr Gopichand Hinduja, who also 
appeared to have lots of money, an aide explained. The new 
deputy foreign minister's willingness to make time for wealthy 
and influential people like Mr Hinduja -- said to be the 
10th-richest man in the world -- became clear as he explained 
the new government's pragmatic and interest-driven foreign 
policy. 
  Simply put, it entailed being very nice to the rich and 
powerful, nice to the potentially rich and powerful and kind to 
old friends who were neither. Although Mr Pahad would blanche 
at such a crude assessment, he agreed that gone were the days of 
making friends for friends' sake to further partisan objectives. 
  It is a whole new game for a man who spent a good part of 
his 
ANC career trying to isolate South Africa, and a department 
which devoted itself to sanctions-busting and forming ties with 
everyone that would have it. 
  Like all the other ministries under the new government, 
South 
Africa's foreign policy priorities are dictated by the need to 
ensure the Reconstruction and Development Programme's [RDP] 
success. 
  "Our priority is making sure that the country has a 
sustainable, growing economy, otherwise the Reconstruction and 
Development Programme will remain an empty theoretical concept," 
Mr Pahad said. 
  The job of the Foreign Affairs department was to promote and 
sell this programme abroad to secure foreign resources as 
swiftly as possible. 
  Mr Pahad firmly ruled out the sale of grand embassies and 
art 
works as mooted by Minister Without Portfolio Jay Naidoo. The 
resources he speaks of are investment, favourable trading terms, 
development aid and soft loans. 
  Given South Africa's sanctions-battered past, the focus will 
be to increase favourable economic relations with its 
traditional trading partners -- the United States and the 
European Union. But, Mr Pahad said, South Africa would also be 
looking beyond traditional partners to expand economic relations 
with, among others, Canada, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, India, 
the People's Republic of China and Latin America. 
  Another area where links were unexplored was the Middle 
East, 
not only for trade, investment and tourism but for oil, he said. 
  There were also important new friends to consolidate 
politically in the context of being the new government. These 
would include China, which was sympathetic to the ANC as a 
liberation movement, and Russia, whose relationship with the ANC 
changed with the collapse of communism at the turn of the 
decade. Both these countries are permanent members of the UN 
Security Council. 
  As there were scores of other developing countries on the 
lookout for favourable relations with the most important 
economic and political blocs -- the EU, NAFTA and the 
Association of South East Asian Nations -- SA [South Africa] had 
to capitalise on the enormous goodwill that existed since the 
successful elections, and keep it going, said Mr Pahad. 
  South Africa had two aces to play in this regard. The first 
was its moral status in the world. The second, its position in 
an increasingly marginalised continent. 
  Despite all gloomy predictions, South Africa became the 
example of the "best miracle of the century". "We have captured 
the moral high ground in non-racialism, democracy and conflict 
resolution to become the world leader in this arena." 
  But, more importantly, it had become imperative for the rest 
of the world that this success story continued. For if South 
Africa were to fail -- and its success depended on consolidating 
democracy with economic growth -- there would be serious 
consequences for other countries' internal policies on democracy 
and racism. 
  "They see our success as a godsend to a more healthy 
approach 
to politics. They want us to succeed." Another ace was South 
Africa's position in the continent of Africa. "If we don't 
sink, they see the hope that the region won't sink, and if the 
region doesn't sink they see some hope of a breakthrough in the 
development of other parts of Africa." 
  This brings him to South Africa's second foreign policy 
priority -- its relationship with the southern African region, 
which, he says, is fundamental to South Africa's broader 
interests. 
  President Nelson Mandela's reception at the OAU summit this 
week as the messiah of the continent highlighted the important 
role that South Africa could play in the continent. However, 
South Africa will have to be careful to straddle the demands and 
expectations of the rest of Africa with pragmatic policies. 
  Mr Pahad once again has a realistic attitude towards 
relations with Africa. "Unless we can achieve mutually 
beneficial development in our region, we will not be able to 
tackle effectively our international or regional challenges," he 
said. 
  This translates into developing regional co-operation by 
joining the SADC [South African Development Community] and 
rationalising the many regional institutions like the SA Customs 
Union and the Preferential Trade Agreement. 
  He stops at integration. This was a long-term vision and 
would be dictated by the process of co-operation. It would 
also be in South Africa's interests to ensure stability in both 
the region and the continent. A lot of time would be spent 
strengthening OAU mechanisms for conflict resolution. 
  Mr Pahad sees regional cooperation extending not only to 
areas of economic development but to basic issues like 
gun-smuggling, drug-peddling, refugees and illegal immigrants. 
  He distinguished between illegal immigrants and refugees, 
the latter which South Africa would deal with according to 
internationally accepted conventions. "But we cannot turn a 
blind eye to illegal immigrants. We are going to have to deal 
with this in a way that protects the interests of our country. 
We must have an effective immigration policy and apply it 
justly and humanely." 
  It was in this context that regional development became a 
priority for SA. "If you don't have mutually advantageous 
regional development, illegal immigrants will come to South 
Africa. And, given that our borders are so big, we will not be 
able to prevent it". 
  On the question of the country's role in the OAU, Mr Pahad 
said that with its expertise in many fields South Africa could 
help the organisation become a more effective body on the 
continent and in the United Nations. 
  Implicit in this is South Africa's desire to be the first 
African country to take a permanent seat on the UN Security 
Council. 
  The government's policy of making new friends and extending 
South Africa's profile into uncharted territories would not mean 
establishing diplomatic missions everywhere in the world, he 
said. This would be dictated by the budget and the national 
interest and would entail downscaling some embassies, having one 
diplomatic representatives serving several countries, upgrading 
priority areas and establishing links with countries with 
perceived potential. 
  One example under debate was the policy towards the People's 
Republic of China and Taiwan. He pointed out that, should South 
Africa establish diplomatic ties with the PRC, it would have to 
forego long-established diplomatic ties with Taiwan. The PRC 
was important for South Africa not only because of the enormous 
trade potential, but also because it was a permanent member of 
the UN Security Council. Taiwan was however, one of South 
Africa's largest trading partners. 
  "In the final analysis, our decision will be determined by 
our own interests and international precedents." 
  Mr Pahad stressed that foreign policy would not be dictated 
only by South Africa's interests. 
  However, establishing friendships and coming to the rescue 
of 
friends did not necessitate establishing embassies in these 
countries. "There are other forms of interaction and 
co-operation."

<F P=106> [Report by Nick Bezuidenhout] </F>
  [Text] Approximately 11,000 posts in the civil service are 
being advertised countrywide today at all government offices as 
part of the government's plan to introduce affirmative action in 
the public service. These include several new posts for people 
who have to oversee this affirmative action program. This 
follows the announcement, barely a week ago, of a short- and 
long-term plan for affirmative action in the civil service. In 
terms of the short-term plan, all vacant civil service posts 
will be advertised. Posts where recommendations for 
appointments have already been made will have to be advertised 
again. 
  Part of the long-term plan is to appoint people in every 
department at national and provincial level to oversee the 
affirmative action program in the departments. The majority of 
the posts advertised in the document of approximately 800 pages 
are existing vacancies or posts where recommendations for the 
filling of those posts have been withdrawn in line with the 
policy of affirmative action. Altogether 246 of the 11,000 
vacant posts are for the management sector of the civil service 
(directors and higher). 
  The new posts for people overseeing affirmative action are 
posts for a chief director, director, deputy director, four 
posts for senior administrative officials, and two secretaries. 
These people will work in the office of the Public Service 
Commission. According to the advertisement the duty of the 
chief director is, among others things, to give advice on the 
collection of information on the composition of the civil 
service, concerning steps for a more representative civil 
service and negotiations on policy for a more representative 
civil service. 
  An unknown number of posts for role interpreters in all 
departments at national and provincial level are also 
advertised. The duties of the people in these posts are 
described as, among other things, the introduction of steps to 
make the civil service more representative and the delivery of 
support services to people belonging to the "under-represented 
groups." A spokesman for the office of the Public Service 
Commission said upon enquiry that the new posts will only be 
filled if suitable candidates apply.

  [Text] Cape Town -- ANC proposals to institute race 
monitors to ensure "affirmative action" in the public sector 
would result in anti-White discrimination, and increased 
emigration of the country's skilled personnel, the Freedom Front 
[FF] said yesterday. Mr Joseph Chiole, Freedom Front spokesman 
on state administration, said elements of the ANC's affirmative 
action proposals "spell serious danger that the greatest racial 
discrimination in South Africa's history -- against Whites -- is 
now being planned". 
  This was indicated by the fact that the recommendations of 
the Public Service Commission on the filling of vacant posts, 
including recommendations made after merit determination, had 
been withdrawn. This had to be seen against the fact that the 
government proposed to institute race monitors to ensure that 
affirmative action took place, not only in the civil service but 
also in the private sector. 
  "The fact that in some instances undertakings will have to 
keep records of the race of their employees as well as their 
clients will increase the level of racial tension in South 
Africa. It would also increase bureaucratic red tape, which 
could have serious financial repercussions for businesses." 
  Referring to the statement last week by Public Service and 
Administration Minister Mr Zola Skweyiya that "monitoring 
mechanisms" would watch developments in every department of 
state, Mr Chiole said that, in simple terminology, this meant 
preferential treatment for blacks. The implication was that 
appointments would not necessarily be made on the basis of 
merit, and that qualified Whites faced blatant racial 
discrimination.

  [Text] Pretoria June 16 SAPA -- Agriculture Minister Kraai 
van Niekerk has approved a broad plan for the implementation of 
tariffs on agricultural products, the Agriculture Department's 
chief marketing director Attie Swart announced on Thursday [16 
June]. Mr Swart said the plan was drawn up by the department in 
consultation with the Board on Tariffs and Trade and the 
Department of Trade and Industry. 
  The implementation plan provided for differentiated action 
to 
be taken on each of four categories of product grouping. The 
first category included all tariff products already identified 
and to which qualitative import restrictions no longer applied, 
or whose quantitative restrictions would be removed at a 
determined future date. The second category covered products 
with reasonable tariffs already in place but in respect of which 
quantitative import controls still applied. The third category 
included products to which certain tariffs and import controls 
currently applied. The fourth category includes products in 
respect of which specific statutory marketing measures were in 
place. 
  According to the statement, the successful outcome of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's Uruguay Round of 
multilateral negotiations obliged South Africa to put tariffs on 
all agricultural products and to lift remaining quantitative 
import restrictions before the agreement's implementation date 
on January 1 next year. "Starting from that date South Africa 
will have six years to phase- in its implementation commitments 
according to predetermined formulas," Mr Swart said. 
  "Notwithstanding South Africa's obligations under the GATT's 
Uruguay Round, it has been the official policy of the Department 
of Agriculture to move away from a policy of quantitative import 
control in favour of a tariff protection-only approach," the 
statement said. 
  The successful implementation of the Uruguay Round had not 
brought about major changes in departmental policy, but had 
rather placed an urgency on its implementation. 
  The statement said the Department of Agriculture was in 
favour of the abolition of surcharge on agricultural products.

  [Text] Pietermaritzburg June 18 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP] leader and Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi on Saturday [18 June] accused the African National 
Congress of using the KwaZulu/Natal provincial capital issue to 
try and "demonise" him and his party. Speaking at an IFP 
victory rally at Taylor's Halt near Pietermaritzburg, Mr 
Buthelezi said: "If the people of this province wish to have 
Ulundi as their capital, Ulundi shall be the capital". 
  He said the ANC's opposition to Ulundi as capital was rooted 
more in political anger and resentment than in rational and 
sound political argument. 
  He said the attitude was "extremely destructive, 
counter-productive and contrary to the spirit of provincial 
reconciliation". 
  According to Mr Buthelezi, the Ulundi controversy was a 
smokescreen which the ANC was using for a new campaign to try 
"once again to demonise me and demonise the IFP". 
  He added if the people chose Ulundi as the capital and this 
created administrative problems, corrective compromises and 
interim measures would be sought to solve them. He said the 
resources in administrative offices and infrastructures 
available in pietermaritzburg would be fully utilised, 
irrespective of where the seat of government would be. 
  Turning to problems within the IFP, Mr Buthelezi said there 
were certain party members who were also trying to boycott 
provincial Premier Dr Frank Mdlalose "because of their own 
personal convenience". 
  "I wish to warn these members of the IFP and remind them 
that 
their primary responsibility is to serve those who elected them 
into office. 
  "They were put where they are by me and the IFP. There is 
such a thing as party discipline. 
  "They should therefore not force us to ask them to resign", 
he added.

  [Text] The National Party [NP] has warned that 
KwaZulu-Natal could suffer untold harm to its economy unless the 
question of a capital for the region is handled responsibly. 
This follows reports of an ANC plan to boycott a provincial 
legislature meeting in Ulundi. Mr. Tino Volker of the NP called 
for a special sitting of the provincial legislature to appoint 
an advisory committee on the site for a capital. 
  Meanwhile, the ANC has confirmed it will boycott the next 
sitting of the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature which is scheduled to 
be held in Ulundi at the end of this month. The ANC said it was 
politically wrong to hold the meeting in the IFP stronghold.

<F P=106> [Article by Farouk Chotia] </F>
  [Text] Having lost his stranglehold over Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini, Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi last weekend issued thinly veiled threats to the 
monarch, questioned his loyalty to the Zulu nation and projected 
himself as being more powerful than the king. 
  By contrast, the ANC rallied to the defence of Zwelithini, 
promising to protect him in the face of Buthelezi's "insults" by 
enshrining his rights in the national constitution -- including 
a guarantee that the IFP-controlled KwaZulu/Natal provincial 
legislature would not have power to withhold his salary. 
  The 24-year relationship between Zwelithini and Buthelezi 
has 
reached a turning-point, with the nephew finally elbowing his 
uncle off the royal throne in Nongoma. 
  Informed sources painted a picture of Zwelithini as fearing 
Buthelezi. Said one source: "The king told the ANC delegation 
at one of their meetings that he does not want to return to the 
tyranny and terror he has faced. Those were his exact words." 
  An elated ANC Natal Midlands spokesman Blade Nzimande said 
this week that Buthelezi has lost his two "main pillars of 
support" -- the KwaZulu government and the king. 
  Buthelezi denied there was "any clash or argument of any 
kind" between himself and the king. But he went on to accuse 
the ANC of trying to "worm its way into the king's confidence". 
  Observers believe that without Zwelithini's backing, the 
IFP's hand in upcoming constitutional talks will be considerably 
weakened. 
  At a watershed rally in Umlazi last weekend Buthelezi 
downplayed the significance of the monarch. 
  "The only way forward for the Zulu kingdom and for all the 
people in KwaZulu/Natal will come from you, the members of the 
IFP," he said. 
  Buthelezi revealed that the former KwaZulu government had 
spent almost R7-million [rand] on Zwelithini's five palaces, 
more than R2-million to provide him with labourers, more than 
R500,000 to assist him in developing "modern farm undertakings" 
and "to date we have actually spent over R4-million on securing 
His Majesty's personal position and on supplementary 
requirements around his person". 
  Stoking emotions of betrayal among IFP supporters, Buthelezi 
told the crowd: "In a very real sense, this was your money. It 
was the people's money ... It was money you, as ordinary people, 
gladly forewent in favour of that money being spend on schools, 
hospitals and health." 
  Buthelezi projected himself as being more powerful than 
Zwelithini, saying he had "elevated" the monarchy to a position 
"other Zulu kings have failed to achieve". 
  He added that he was also "behind the fact that Zwelithini 
has emerged as a "modern" king. Buthelezi also raised the 
possibility of another king in his lifetime, even though he is 
65 years old and Zwelithini is 20 years younger. "I am loyal to 
His Majesty and I will die being loyal to whichever Zulu king 
walks in the footsteps of great Zulu kings ...," he said. 
  He also reminded the monarch that he would be reliant on the 
KwaZulu/Natal provincial legislature for the "large budgets" he 
would need to maintain his "kingly way of life". 
  To overcome the loss of the monarch, observers believe the 
IFP could attempt to rebuild an alliance with the National Party 
-- particularly its Western Cape region -- to demand greater 
federal powers. Observers believe that the IFP's chances of 
winning local government elections next year have also been 
significantly reduced. 
  As a counter-strategy, Buthelezi may fight Zwelithini for 
the 
loyalty of chiefs through IFP-control of the KwaZulu/Natal 
provincial legislature. 
  Sources said Zwelithini was determined to ensure that his 
chiefs adopted a non-partisan role in the ANC-IFP conflict. He 
fired the first salvo in this direction when he attended the 
inauguration ceremony of a chief in Mtunzini shortly after the 
April poll and voiced concern that some chiefs were "abusing" 
their powers. 
  Sources revealed that moves were afoot to convene a private 
meeting between several chiefs -- including ANC KwaZulu/Natal 
parliamentarian chief Zibuse Mlaba and chief OT Xolo, a former 
KwaZulu deputy minister who has ditched the IFP -- and 
Zwelithini. 
  Sources said Zwelithini might also call a meeting of his 
chiefs to encourage them to adopt a non-partisan role. Sources 
also said that while Zwelithini had no plan to publicly denounce 
Buthelezi, he would strip him of his status as "traditional 
prime minister" by excluding him from the Royal Council he plans 
to form to advise him on political and other issues. 
  The sources said a senior prince who has played a pivotal 
role in encouraging the king to break away from Buthelezi was a 
strong candidate for the post of traditional prime minister. 
  But Buthelezi has strongly suggested that even if the king 
sacks him, he will continue to perform this function. At the 
Umlazi rally, he claimed he was "born" to inherit the post. 
  To boost his claim, Buthelezi is increasingly interfering in 
the politics of KwaZulu/Natal in his capacity as "traditional 
prime minister", giving orders to the elected premier, Frank 
Mdlalose. He has brought Gideon Zulu, a prince loyal to him, 
into the provincial cabinet and pushed for Ulundi as the 
province's capital with far greater vehemence than Mdlalose. 
  By having Ulundi as the capital Buthelezi hopes the IFP will 
retain its image as a Zulu traditionalist party at a time when 
Zwelithini has ditched them. Observers believe Zwelithini has 
indicated his preference for Pietermaritzburg by attending the 
opening of the provincial legislature in the city while 
boycotting a ceremony where Buthelezi was to have "presented" 
the KwaZulu/Natal cabinet to him. 
  At the weekend Buthelezi also set out to smash the king's 
credibility among IFP loyalists by questioning Zwelithini's 
decision to replace his KwaZulu bodyguards with members of the 
Defence Force. 
  Sources said Zwelithini's changing of the guard had stung 
Buthelezi the most: he has lost his eyes and ears in the Royal 
House, making it possible for the monarch to convene what 
Buthelezi called "clandestine" meetings with ANC leaders and 
surround himself with non-IFP princes. 
  Buthelezi said the move had taken place before the election 
when Zwelithini told him of a phone call he received from 
ex-minister of foreign affairs Pik Botha, warning of "threats of 
his life" and the need to "tighten up" security. Buthelezi 
suggested that the King's life was now in danger.

  [Text] This grave matter of a split reportedly being 
orchestrated by some people between his majesty and the 
[traditional] prime minister of the Zulu nation, the prince of 
Phindangene, is a great tragedy for the entire nation. 
  Several times the prime minister has voiced his concern as a 
Zulu about this issue that he finds so distressful. Whenever 
such things happen the Zulu nation reads between the lines that 
something is brewing within the royal house. We know that the 
prince would not shed tears over nothing. We also believe it is 
because of the bitter distress he feels about what might befall 
the Zulu nation if this conspiracy succeeds. 
  We want to put it plainly that the majority of Zulus are 
greatly distressed by these alarming reports concerning renewed 
attempts to put a wedge between the prince and his majesty. 
  The big question people are asking is, since the prince has 
time and again stated that he is unhappy about the machinations 
of some to cause a split between him and the king, what is his 
majesty saying about all these reports, and how does it all 
affect him? 
  The people of KwaZulu now know the adverse effects that 
might 
result from a misunderstanding or a split between the king and 
the prince of Phindangene. The people of KwaZulu now know that 
if the campaign to cause a split between a them succeeds, the 
royal house and the Zulu monarchy will be immeasurably damaged, 
and the very authority of the office of the king will be greatly 
compromised and endangered. This is what preoccupies the Zulu 
nation on buses, trains, taxis, at markets, shops, church 
gatherings, and even at wedding celebrations. 
  People are saying they want his majesty to come out in the 
open because his continued silence over these reports is causing 
confusion in his people about where their king stands on a 
matter that is causing them such grief.

  [Text] Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini will remain the 
official trustee of all land belonging to the formal KwaZulu 
homeland, but will not own or have governing rights over the 
land. This is the result of a report made to the Cabinet this 
week by Land Affairs Minister Derek Hanekom, who chaired a 
commission to investigate the implications of the Ingonyama 
Trust Act. 
  The Act, which makes the king a trustee over about 
three-million hectares, was singed by former State President 
F.W. de Klerk two days before the April 27 elections. The Act 
came under wide criticism because neither the Transitional 
Executive Council (TEC) nor the ANC had been consulted before it 
was passed. 
  Hanekom said that the Act would need to be amended or 
substituted to clarify that as a trustee, the king is not the 
sole owner of the land, nor is he able to act in any governing 
capacity over the affairs of the people living on it. 
  For example, issues of tribal disputes would not be decided 
by the King purely because he is the trustee. Hanekom also said 
that the Act would be amended to ensure that amenities for 
public use as well as urban areas that fall under the territory 
will not be under the control of the King, but will instead be 
governed by the provincial government. 
  Furthermore, the people living on the land will be 
guaranteed 
security of tenure, and will be able to convert that tenure to 
ownership if need be. 
  Land Affairs spokesperson Helmuth Schlenther said that 
although the King was vested with "thousands" of hereditary 
powers as King, he would not, as the trustee, be able to use 
these powers over the Trust land. 
  He stressed that all of the people living on the land were 
the official beneficiaries of the Trust, and could thus veto any 
decision made by the King concerning the land or its inhabitants. 
  "Basically, the King can't do anything without the consent 
of 
the people living on the land," Schlenther said. 
  This erases concern by some sectors that the King, as 
trustee, would be able to appoint or remove chiefs if they fell 
in or out of favour. It also means that because of the King's 
lack of control, other than ceremonial, over the land, attempts 
by the Inkatha Freedom Party-dominated provincial government to 
use the King's power over the land and its people to gain 
political support will be unlikely.

<F P=106> [Article by Mondi waka Makhanya] </F>
  [Text] A leadership tussle within the ANC's Western Cape 
region has precipitated the first real confrontation in the 
regional cabinet. 
  The skirmish between ANC ministers and premier Hernus Kriel 
was the first real test for the provincial administration, with 
hard words being traded publicly for the first time since the 
elections. 
  It appears the timing for the challenge on Kriel was a ploy 
to underscore the anti-National Party credentials of regional 
minister of the environment Lerumo Kalako, public works minister 
Leonard Ramatlakane and ANC chief whip Chris Nissen in advance 
of elections at next month's crucial ANC regional congress. At 
this, the trio are expected to mount a challenge to ANC regional 
chairman and regional economic affairs minister Allan Boesak. 
It is seen as significant that the attack on Kriel coincided 
with an overseas trip by Boesak. 
  Boesak has his back to the wall as pressure mounts for his 
replacement from elements blaming him for the ANC's poor showing 
in the April election. There are indications he may step down 
ahead of the regional congress to avoid the humiliation of 
almost certain defeat. Should this happen he will most probably 
take up an ambassadorship to Washington, a post for which he is 
being considered. 
  Although there are several contenders for his position, the 
most likely successor is health and welfare minister Ebrahim 
Rassool, who has no political baggage and no major enemies. 
  At issue are accusations that Kriel breached protocol by not 
consulting the ANC before last week's premiers' summit with 
Public Administration Minister Zola Skweyiya on the issue of 
provincial powers. Kalako, Ramatlakane and Nissen 
unsuccessfully tried to get central government to delay 
conferring powers on the Western Cape on grounds that Kriel had 
violated protocol. Notably missing from the altercation was 
Rassool. 
  The issue was resolved when -- after Boesak's return -- the 
ANC accepted Kriel's explanation that the disputed ordinances 
had been drawn up by central government and not himself. 
Nonetheless Nissen was adamant that the skirmish had sent a 
message to Kriel that he should consult. 
  The dispute forced Kriel to make his first public attack on 
the ANC, calling on Boesak to "discipline" his troops. 
  Minor as it was, the dispute highlighted a debate in the ANC 
about how to deal with the Kriel government. The ANC is caught 
between not wanting Kriel to take too much credit for successes 
of the Reconstruction and Development Programme in the region 
and their insistence on its implementation. This is another 
issue likely to dominate the congress as the ANC defines its 
role as junior partner for the next five years. 
  Observers inside and outside the ANC see the challenge as a 
muscle-flexing exercise, which could have only happened in 
Boesak's absence. 
  "Various people are trying to establish themselves for 
Boesak's position, and the best way do that is to show you are 
not going to listen to what the Nats have to say," said an 
observer. 
  He added: "I pray the congress does not fracture us too 
much. The last thing we need is to be divided in the NP's 
backyard. But the way things are going now, we might need to 
call those internal stability `manne' [men] to be on standby."

  [Text] The ANC is experiencing serious financial problems 
largely due to its extravagance. The property it is now 
planning to sell will not be able to cover its total debt, which 
means it is technically bankrupt. These developments naturally 
place a serious question mark over the ANC's ability to control 
the country's economy. According to sources within the ANC the 
movement has a huge debt to settle. In selling its foreign 
assets, the value of which is estimated at 20 million rands, 
only part of that debt will be paid. In order to lighten that 
debt burden even further the ANC will possibly have to lease 
some of its office space at its headquarters, Shell House, in 
Johannesburg. Some members even suggested putting the entire 
building on the market and then leasing space in the building 
for the organization. 
  One of the projects to which the ANC is paying attention is 
the compulsory payment of levies by their officials. An 
ordinary ANC MP will apparently have to pay 750 rands per month 
to the ANC, while a minister will be asked to pay 2,000 rands. 
This technical bankruptcy explains why it was decided to give 
such high salaries to politicians. Before the election Mr. 
Mandela said that the time for "fat pigs" [preceding two words 
in English] was over, while it now appears that that time has 
only just arrived. If the politicians do not receive those high 
salaries then they will not be able to help the ANC out of its 
misery. 
  These salaries are paid by the taxpayer, which means that 
the 
ANC is indirectly being lifted out of its bankruptcy by the 
taxpayer. This is the first scandal to confront the Mandela 
government. Meanwhile, a second scandal has also come to light. 
Minister of Land Affairs Mr. Derek Hanekom initially indicated 
that he was not interested in one of the expensive official cars 
because his portfolio only requires a pickup truck for the dirt 
roads of the rural areas. Now it appears that his truck is an 
expensive imported model costing as much as the official cars, 
if not more. With this sort of financial discipline (or rather 
the lack of it) the fears of economists for the future of the 
country are not unfounded.

<F P=106> [Report by labor correspondent Jovial Rantao] </F>
  [Text] The ANC has advised most of its head office staff to 
seek work elsewhere or opt for voluntary retrenchment as jobs 
will be lost when the organisation begins restructuring on 
October 1. 
  ANC sources said party secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa 
held 
a staff meeting yesterday -- the second in two weeks -- at which 
he spelt out the situation. 
  Documents leaked to WEEKEND STAR show that the decision to 
reorganise the party's head office, which employs more than 
1,000 people, was taken on Tuesday by the ANC's national working 
committee. 
  The committee decided that voluntary retrenchment, at the 
discretion of the organisation, would be effected on July 1. 
Retrenchment packages of four months' salary plus an amount for 
each year of service would be offered. 
  Staff who did not opt for voluntary retrenchment and were 
not 
appointed to new positions would be retrenched on October 1 with 
two months' salary plus an amount for each year of service. 
  Employees at the ANC's headquarters said yesterday that they 
were saddened by the development. Most had hoped to be 
integrated into the public service. 
  Ramaphosa would not comment yesterday. A news briefing would 
be organised next week to outline the reorganisation, he said.

<F P=106> [By David Breier] </F>
  [Text] Cape Town -- The ANC wants to increase the number of 
parliamentary select committees amid accusations that it is 
creating the illusion that hundreds of bored backbenchers are 
gainfully occupied. Parliamentary sources confirm the ANC wants 
to set up 26 select committees in the National Assembly -- one 
for each portfolio in the Cabinet. 
  But National Party [NP] chief whip Fanus Schoeman says the 
NP 
believes 19 select committees will be sufficient as various 
portfolios can be grouped -- such as water affairs, forestry and 
agriculture. 
  He says experience has shown that some portfolios produce 
only one or two Bills a year and do not justify a select 
committee of their own. Parliamentary officials confirm that 
the number of select committees has not yet been finalised. 
  Some MPs say the ANC's move to increase the number of select 
committees is to ensure that all the members of its massive 
caucus belong to a committee to give them some work to do. The 
ANC has 252 National Assembly members and 60 senators. 
  By comparison the NP, which has the next biggest caucus, has 
far fewer MPs -- meaning that they will be relatively busier 
with committee work. The NP has 82 MPs and 17 senators. 
  The smaller parties will have their work cut out keeping up 
with committee work, with MPs having to sit on several 
committees. 
  The Inkatha Freedom Party has 43 Assembly seats and five 
senators, the Democracy Party has seven Assembly members and 
three senators while the Pan Africanist Congress has just five 
Assembly MPs and the African Christian Democratic Party two MPs. 
  Taking into account the growing backlash against the huge 
salaries being paid to politicians -- backbenchers are to earn 
R193,000 [rand] a year -- any sign that MPs are idle is bound to 
increase public anger. 
  Since the abolition of the constituency system in favour of 
proportional representation, MPs are no longer directly 
responsible for a specific seat. This has created concern that 
many ANC backbenchers in particular are going to be grossly 
overpaid and underworked. 
  However, both the Nats and the ANC are setting up structures 
to make MPs responsible for specific areas to increase their 
workload. 
  Schoeman says Nat MPs will be even busier than in the past 
as 
the party structure will keep a watch on the amount of work they 
do, whereas in the past MPs could "bury themselves" in their 
constituencies without anyone really knowing how much work they 
did. 
  There have been calls on Cabinet Ministers to use 
under-employed MPs more constructively instead of employing 
outsiders at taxpayers' expense. In one case, former CAPE TIMES 
editor Tony Heard is to be appointed senior adviser to Water 
Affairs and Forestry Minister Kader Asmal. An MP could to the 
job without further pay. DP Natal Senator Errol Moorcroft 
predicts that many backbenchers from the biggest parties will be 
"bored with life" as they will have little to do. On the other 
hand, MPs from smaller parties such as the DP will be inundated 
with work, he says. 
  MPs now have to pay for their own expenses -- even stamps -- 
which will cut the effective pay of the busier MPs from the 
smaller parties, while those from the bigger parties with a 
smaller workload will increase their "profit" margins. 
  Up-country MPs complain that their salaries are justified by 
the expense of running a second household in Cape Town. As long 
as Parliament remains in Cape Town, the best-off MPs will be the 
Cape ones who have no need for a second home. Should Parliament 
move to Pretoria, it will be the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] MPs who will coin it.

  [Text] Johannesburg June 18 SAPA -- President Nelson 
Mandela on Saturday [18 June] stressed it was necessary to bring 
the Conservative Party [CP] under the leadership of Dr Ferdi 
Hartzenberg into the democratic process in South Africa. He made 
this point during an address at a conference of the Congress of 
Traditional Leaders of SA (Contralesa) in Johannesburg. 
  Saying the creation of the volkstaat [homeland] council was 
aimed at resolving the question of an Afrikaner state in a 
responsible manner, Mr Mandela said discussions with Dr 
Hartzenberg had already seen the CP leader shift away from the 
Afrikaner weerstandsbeweging [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance 
Movement]. 
  "We want to bring the right wing into the same process that 
the National Party finds itself in to prevent bloodshed in our 
country. 
  "As a result of our discussions, we got General Constand 
Viljoen to move away from the rigid position of the Afrikaner 
volksfront. Similarly, we have been able to get Dr Hartzenberg 
away from the Eugene Terreblanche's AWB," he said to loud 
applause. 
  "We as a government of national unity have to be responsible 
when we deal with their (the Afrikaners') demands. If the 
Afrikaners decide they want a volkstaat, we will deal with it in 
a particular manner. 
  "But before that, we want to know whether they do represent 
all Afrikaners in our country," Mr Mandela said. 
  Regarding structures for traditional African leaders, the 
president said it was imperative greater urgency was given to 
creating the bodies catered for in the interim constitution. 
  "I refer to the setting up of the houses of traditional 
leaders in the provinces where this is required; the 
constitution of the National Council of Traditional Leaders and 
the drafting of legislation regarding the functioning of these 
institution. 
  "In consultation with the provinces, we shall ensure that 
the 
relevant ministries as well as the commission on provincial 
government immediately set this process in motion." 
  Mr Mandela added that his government recognised the equality 
of all traditional leaders and kings. 
  "Whilst we do acknowledge that there are regional varieties, 
this cannot be interpreted to mean that traditional leaders in 
any given area should occupy a rung above the others. No king is 
above other kings in our country. All our kings will enjoy the 
same status," he said. 
  Also present at the conference were Minister of 
Constitutional Affairs Mr Roelf Meyer, his deputy Mohammed Valli 
Moosa and Deputy Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and 
Technology Mrs Winnie Mandela.

  [Text] Pretoria June 18 SAPA -- Renewed rightwing terrorism 
would hit South Africa unless the government agreed to amnesty 
for rightist political prisoners, Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging 
[AWB, Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene Terreblanche 
said on Saturday [18 June]. "The pre-election bombing blitz on 
the Reef proved that there were people who know how to plant 
bombs. No force in the world will be able to stop rightwing 
terrorism if the government does not accede to our demands", he 
told SAPA in Pretoria. 
  He was speaking after a protest march in the city centre by 
about 120 rightwingers demanding the cut-off date for political 
crimes be set at April 27, 1994. 
  In a memorandum handed to an official of the Justice 
Department, the rightwingers also said Justice Minister Dullah 
Omar was biased against the rightwing in his definition of 
political prisoners. 
  "Mr Nelson Mandela's conciliatory statements must be 
translated into conciliatory actions," the memorandum stated. 
  The march was held under the banner of the political rights 
organisation, established last year to campaign for the release 
of "conservative political prisoners". 
  Well-known rightiwngers such as Mr Barend Strydom, Mrs Gaye 
Derby-Lewis and Mr Piet Rudolph took part in the protest. 
  Conservative Party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg could not attend 
because of "over-commitments", local Afrikaner Volksfront 
[Afrikaner National Front] leader Jan du Toit said. 
  The group, led by an AWB band, marched from the Pretoria 
city 
hall to the corner of Paul Kruger and Pretorius Streets, where 
the memorandum was handed to justice official Dr Flip Jacobs. 
  Mr Terre'blanche told a small crowd the government had to 
release rightwing leaders if it was really interested in peace. 
  "Today we came in peace to put our request. The next time we 
may not be so peaceful as our leaders in prison cells will start 
calling for revenge," he warned. 
  Referring to the small number of rightwingers who turned up, 
Mr du Toit said numbers were not important. "We don't force or 
pay our people to take part in protest marches."

  [Text] A Dutch mercenary and former member of the French 
Foreign Legion, recruited during the civil war in Bosnia to 
fight for the far-right in South Africa, has surrendered 
recently to the police in Pretoria. He is in protective custody 
and is giving valuable information to the police concerning the 
activities of the far-right and plans to establish an 
underground "people's army" of international freedom fighters 
with close neo-Nazi links in South Africa. 
<H5>  German Recruits </H5>
  The 46-year-old Ronald Deuster arrived in the country from 
Europe two months ago with two German recruits. He was not 
pleased about the amateurish way in which right-wing extremists 
tried to get their underground struggle off the ground and 
decided to reveal everything to the police. Before the election 
Deuster converged with other foreign mercenaries and far-right 
South Africans on a farm outside Brits, but since then everyone 
has dispersed. A former member of the AWB, Mr. Eddie MacIntosh, 
owner of the Silkaatsnek Nature Reserve near Brits, this week 
confirmed that Deuster was employed there and that he had 
surrendered to the police. 
<H5>  Fought in Bosnia </H5>
  "According to his documents Deuster was in the French 
Foreign 
Legion and he also fought in Bosnia, where he heard of the 
possibility of coming to fight in South Africa," says Mr. 
MacIntosh. "However, the AWB's [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] 
war games did not impress him. He complained that there are too 
many generals and not enough foot soldiers in the AWB." 
Brigadier John Wright, executive director of Interpol's 
National Central Bureau in Pretoria (Interpol NCB), this week 
confirmed that his unit is playing a leading role in the 
identifying of international neo-Nazi suspects in South Africa. 
Brig. Wright specifically referred to the two New Zealand 
mercenaries, the twins who acted as bodyguards for AWB leader 
Eugene Terreblanche, and the latest breakthrough concerning the 
arrest of a French citizen in KwaZulu-Natal.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  SUNDAY TIMES </H8>
  Putting Domestic Problems First -- "As the facade of 
Nationalist power is stripped away," weekly revelations show how 
"South Africa subsided into the parlous condition which now 
confronts the government"; "islands of privilege have been 
preserved for officialdom in the sea of poverty that covers most 
of South Africa," notes an editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY 
TIMES in English on 19 June on page 22. "If the waste and 
corruption can be eliminated, the cost of government can surely 
be reduced, and resources may be diverted to meet the more 
urgent needs of the people." "Next week's budget will be heavily 
burdened by the profligate mismanagement of the past. Vested 
interests -- civil servants in Pretoria, bantustan 
bureaucracies, the armed forces, the armaments industry, the 
artsy- craftsy establishment -- that grew fat in the imperial 
years" are fighting "to preserve such elements of the old system 
that can be snatched from the revolution." Internationally "it 
does not seem possible even to explain to foreigners that the 
Nationalists have left South Africa very largely a run-down 
slum." While South Africa has an interest here, it "cannot carry 
this continent, and it serves Africa best by working toward its 
own restoration." "The first, overriding need is to restore our 
economy to health; the second is to attend to the needs of our 
own people; after that, we may lift our eyes to a wider horizon." 
<H8>  RAPPORT </H8>
  Pressure on Finance Minister--"When Minister Derek Keys 
delivers his budget speech on Wednesday he will be closely 
watched to a greater extent than he or his predecessors have 
ever experienced," begins a page-20 editorial in Afrikaans in 
the Johannesburg RAPPORT on 19 June. "Not only is he acting as 
minister of a government of national unity, of whom the main 
role player, the ANC, has a controversial economic policy, but 
he will have to find some balance between what is expected and 
what is possible. On the one hand, he will have to try to boost 
the struggling economy -- a task that has given several of his 
overseas counterparts sleepless nights during a worldwide 
recession. On the other hand he will have to find considerable 
sums of money to finance the reconstruction program." "The 
ambitious Reconstruction and Development Program will result in 
higher state spending." "The promised large numbers of houses, 
schools, and hospitals to be built through increased taxation 
could have a far reaching negative effect on the economy, which 
could in turn affect both rich and poor alike. If extreme 
caution is not applied the internal demand for imported goods 
will rise, followed by a drop in foreign exchange reserves, a 
further weakening of the exchange rate, higher inflation, and 
increased wage demands by unions." "Mr. Keys only has one way 
of narrowing the economic gap: He will have to ensure economic 
growth. South African products will have to be more competitive 
in foreign markets so that it can expand its exports in order to 
build up its foreign exchange reserves." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Petrol Price Increase -- "The consumer is again left 
wondering about the truth behind last week's increase in the 
price of petrol. The Government, now composed of some of the 
people who were very loud in their opposition to the last hike, 
tells us that the increase was unavoidable," notes an editorial 
in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 20 June on page 8. "What 
then confuses us is the Government's attack on people who say 
they can continue selling petrol at the old price," surely "the 
Government should be wishing them good luck and ignoring them." 
Energy Affairs Minister Botha's "argument that deregulation must 
be introduced in an orderly way, sounds too much like old 
National Party language." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Public Broadcasting -- "The SABC's [South African 
Broadcasting Corporation] suggestion to the Independent 
Broadcasting Authority that it be funded by taxation rather than 
by licence fees has merit, but only if it is introduced as part 
of a total change to the country's broadcasting industry and to 
the management of public broadcasting," notes an editorial in 
Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 20 June on page 4. 
"Under the present ANC-led government, the public broadcaster 
has become more democratic. However, with many ANC members in 
management positions, the SABC will have to guard against 
slipping back into its former role as the exclusive voice of the 
regime." "Before any decision is taken on the SABC's funding, 
the broadcaster's role needs to be defined, as does management's 
financial accountability." "What is needed is a full appraisal 
of what services the SABC should most appropriately provide, who 
should be accountable and how they should be transmitted. Only 
then can the queation be addressed of how the public broadcaster 
is to be financed."

  [Text] Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, chairman of the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], reiterated 
in the city of Huambo yesterday that his party is committed to 
searching for a longlasting peace in Angola. The UNITA chairman 
met with UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye. 
However, the contents of the meeting are not known. At the end 
of the meeting, which lasted more than four hours, the UN 
official addressed the Huambo residents who welcomed him 
joyously. Our correspondent Lourenco Bento reports from Huambo: 
  His excellency Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, chairman of UNITA 
and supreme commander of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of 
Angola, has reiterated his party's wish to continue negotiating 
for peace. Addressing thousands of Huambo residents on the 
afternoon of 18 June at the end of his meeting with the special 
representative of the UN secretary general, Dr. Jonas Malheiro 
Savimbi said a true peace representing freedom and dignity was 
necessary. In an allusion to what is delaying the advent of 
peace and reconciliation of Angolans, the leader of the largest 
democratic opposition party in Angola stated that whenever UNITA 
attempted to achieve peace, the Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola [MPLA] responded with war. 
  After noting the need for unity and trust among the people, 
Dr. Savimbi addressed a message of faith and hope to Angolans, 
quote, the difficult days can never be eternal, there will be a 
way out, the day when we shall be happy will come, the time will 
come when the MPLA will accept that it cannot govern this 
country without UNITA, unquote. 
  Meanwhile, the senior UNITA leader stressed the need for 
cooperation between his party and the MPLA for peace to prevail 
in Angola. Dr. Savimbi stressed that the MPLA must understand 
that for peace to prevail in the country, for us all to leave as 
free citizens, it is necessary that MPLA cooperate with UNITA, 
and no one can ignore this. 
  In turn, the UN secretary general's envoy, who held a 
meeting 
with the UNITA leadership for more than four hours, addressed 
the Huambo residents after the meeting.

  [Text] UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye, who 
held a meeting with the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] leadership for more than four 
hours in the city of Huambo, addressed the following words to 
Huambo residents: 
  [Begin Beye recording, in French fading into Portuguese 
translation] Dr. Savimbi, chairman of the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], and residents of Huambo: 
on behalf of the team accompanying me, ambassadors of the United 
States, Portugal, and the Russian Federation, I thank you for 
welcoming us. We are trying to help solve all the difficulties 
you and all other Angolan populations are facing. We have been 
meeting in Lusaka for seven months now, trying to achieve a 
peaceful solution for the Angolan crisis. Quoting the words of 
Dr. Savimbi, we have already gone 90 percent of the way. 
Following the fruitful talks we held this morning, we believe 
there will be a way out of the current situation in Angola. We 
know that you have no food, that there is war in Angola, and 
that everyone wants peace. If you support your leaders, we 
believe we will soon achieve peace in the country. 
  I thank you very much for your presence here this morning. I 
am aware that you have faced innumerous hardships, you have been 
brave, since you have been keeping us company the whole day. 
Thank you very much. [end recording]

  [Text] The United Nations special representative in Angola, 
Alioune Blondin Beye, is in the capital, Luanda, for talks with 
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos after visiting the UNITA 
[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] stronghold 
of Huambo yesterday. Speaking on arrival, Mr. Beye said there 
was no deadlock at the peace talks he has been chairing in 
Zambia for the past seven months. He declined to discuss the 
possibility that the UN might withdraw from Angola at the end of 
the month if no settlement was reached. The government and 
UNITA delegations at the talks have returned to consult with 
their leaders in Angola. A government minister, Albino Malungo, 
has appealed to UNITA to allow the resumption of aid flights, 
which were suspended last Monday [13 June], saying food stores 
could otherwise deteriorate.

  [Text] Luanda June 17 SAPA -- Fighting intensified on 
Friday [17 June] in the Angolan town of Kuito, with government 
forces reportedly gaining control of the southern and western 
parts. State-run radio reported UNITA rebels had deployed two 
commando battalions (about 300 men) to take the town. 
  Government forces this week claimed unidentified aircraft 
had 
dropped supplies for UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] near Chipeta in the Catabola area. 
  The Angolan News Agency ANGOP said UNITA rebels were also 
trying to capture Malanje town in northern Angola, where heavy 
fighting has killed scores of civilians. 
  Peace negotiators meeting in Zambia are still arguing about 
accommodation for UNITA officials throughout the country if a 
peace settlement is achieved. Reports from Lusaka said UNITA 
wanted the government to provide more than 1,000 houses for its 
officials.

  [Text] The military situation in the city of Kuito remains 
unaltered. Clashes are under way and the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] forces are being reinforced 
with contingents from Huambo and Cuando Cubango Provinces. Many 
people are still dying in the Bie capital. The atmosphere of 
war in Kuito is characterized by gunpowder, blood and hunger, 
and the main victims are civilians whom the UNITA rebels have 
decided to strike with their Machiavellian actions with the aim 
of taking over the city at all costs.

  [Excerpts] The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] has once again begun to intensify the shelling of 
the Kuito and Kunje in Bie Province. About 200 wounded people 
could die in the coming five days because of a lack of medicines 
and medical care. [passage omitted] 
  What is more, Jonas Savimbi's men continue to shell the town 
of Tchindjenje in Huambo Province. The aim is to take 
Tchindjenje District, but government troops are preventing the 
rebels' advance. Apart from shelling the town, UNITA is laying 
mines on paths leading to peasants' farms.

  [Text] The political and military situation is still 
critical in N'dalatando where more than 100 civilians have been 
killed. Our correspondent Abilio Correia reports from Cambambe: 
  [Correia] Various commando platoons and special 
battalions of the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] coming from Huambo once again attacked 
N'dalatando on 16 June where violent clashes took place with 
government forces, National Police, and civilian defense. 
Lieutenant General Manuel Jose Nego, commander of the Cuanza 
Norte military region, today told our reporters that the clashes 
lasted more than five hours, and that Jonas Savimbi's soldiers 
had already occupied part of the city. In response, the Angolan 
Armed Forces [FAA] caused considerable losses to the 
enemy who fled in disarray. In their flight, the rebels left on 
the ground more than 37 of their soldiers dead. Eight prisoners 
were taken, and huge quantities of war equipment, such as 
mortars, antitank missiles, automatic machine guns, and an 
assortment of ammunition were also seized. 
  Our source revealed that the UNITA rebels are still 
shelling the city with 32 mm and 85 mm long-range guns although 
with reduced intensity. N'dalatando, which was recovered on 4 
May, is still under the control of the government after 18 
months of UNITA military occupation. Meanwhile, the FAA, 
National Police, and civilian defense are defending the city 
successfully, giving new lessons to the Black Cockerel 
soldiers. 
  The situation in Cuanza Sul has also been described as 
worrisome. Cuanza Sul Provincial Governor Francisco Jose Ramos 
da Cruz says heavy clashes are taking place in the outskirts of 
Cela District between government forces and UNITA. Our 
correspondent Joao Pedro reports from the area: 
  [Pedro] Jonas Savimbi's soldiers are currently moving 
all over the area. UNITA intends to militarily occupy the 
capital of Cela District, Waku Kungo. Governor Francisco da 
Cruz said these attempts and dreams will be neutralized and 
noted that the FAA are consolidating strategic positions in the 
outskirts of Ebo District. He said despite this the military 
situation is still very critical. 
  Clashes are still taking place in Kuito, and the number of 
the dead increases each minute. Abel Abraao reports: 
  [Abraao] UNITA is still killing residents of the 
martyrized city of Kuito. Over the past few hours 39 civilians 
were killed, mostly old people, children and women, and there is 
an unspecified number of wounded. The UNITA rebels intensified 
the shellings in the afternoon yesterday, focusing their attacks 
on the (Fasiang) building and other large centers of 
concentration used as refuge by the residents. 
  Besides indiscriminate raids on the defenseless 
population, the Black Cockerel soldiers attacked various 
positions of the FAA, National Police, and civilian defense 
without success. 
  Despite heavy shelling this morning, a number of people 
were buried in yards. At present there are shellings almost 
everywhere in Kuito. Clashes are increasing, and government 
forces are still inflicting heavy losses on Jonas Savimbi's 
soldiers, who are desperately trying to recover positions lost 
over the past few days. 
  Meanwhile, the situation in Huambo is different. Jonas 
Savimbi's soldiers stationed in Ukuma, Huambo Province, have no 
morale to fight against the FAA. This was revealed by Commander 
Acaba Gozo of the FAA Detachment in Ukuma.

further details. 
  A total of 48 civilians who fled from areas controlled by 
the 
rebels today presented themselves to the government forces 
stationed in Quemba area, 14 km east of Malanje. These 
civilians said Zairian citizens not only fight alongside UNITA 
forces but also carry out trade activities in Caculama District 
and accord logistical assistance to Jonas Savimbi's men.

<F P=106> [News conference by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos in </F>
Niger on 15 June--recorded, in French with Portuguese subtitles; 
translated from the Portuguese] 
  [Text] Speaking at a news conference in the Republic of 
Niger yesterday, President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos 
Santos said the Angolan Government is still committed to 
searching for peace in Angola. In view of that, he has made 
additional concessions to UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola]. The head of state once again expressed 
his dissatisfaction with foreign interference in Angola's 
domestic affairs. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent, in French 
fading into Portuguese translation] Mr. President, you have just 
attended the 30th OAU summit. The Angolan issue was one of the 
points on the agenda. What is your opinion about the manner in 
which the Angolan issued was dealt with? 
  [Dos Santos] The question of Angola was analyzed, first at 
Ministers Council level, and afterward by the summit. The 
Angolan delegation gave an exhaustive briefing about the 
prevailing situation in our country. Our country has been at 
war for 30 years, first against colonialism, then to cope with 
South African aggressions, and lately, after the elections, 
UNITA contested the election results by force of arms. So, we 
are in a state of civil war. We dealt with elements regarding 
the correlation of forces in the military field. 
  We also briefed the summit about the ongoing Lusaka talks 
between the government and UNITA delegations. We have made 
important progress at the talks. The summit adopted a 
declaration on Angola, saluting the efforts that have been made 
by the government in view of its flexibility and sense of 
responsibility to bring peace to the country and create 
conditions for national reconciliation. 
  We raised the question of foreign interference -- namely, 
military assistance that UNITA continues to receive from certain 
countries, from Zaire in particular. We have stated our 
willingness to discuss this issue at length with our brother 
from Zaire, His Excellency Marshal Mobutu. Preparations are 
under way for a meeting between the presidents of Angola and 
Zaire. This morning I spoke to him on the phone and reiterated 
our desire to talk with him [President Mobutu] as brothers and 
as a family to find a solution to the problem. 
  [Correspondent] It is known that the Angolan Government and 
UNITA have been in negotiating in Lusaka. How has the situation 
developed in your country? 
  [Dos Santos] As you know we have been at war since the 
elections because the Bicesse Accord signed in Portugal on 31 
May had shortcomings in terms of monitoring and verification. 
As you know there was not a significant UN role because the 
number of observers that monitored the cease-fire was 
insufficient. But right now, after a year and a half of war we 
can say that the military situation has evolved in the 
government forces' favor. We have coped with the vacuum created 
by the demobilization of government forces. UNITA had hidden at 
least 20,000 men. It did not demobilize its army. At the onset 
that enabled UNITA to control about 70 percent of Angola. 
Nonetheless, people continue to abandon the zones occupied by 
UNITA guerrillas. 
  Like I said, right now the situation is evolving in the 
government forces' favor. I can add that right now UNITA only 
controls 40 percent of the territory. That means that there is 
a continual and positive evolution. 
  We ought to uphold the will of the people who elected the 
government and opted for democracy. Power is not attained 
through the force of arms as used to be said in the past. Now 
the ballot is the weapon people use to uphold their interests 
and aspirations. [end recording]

hostages since Wednesday [15 June] in Huambo. UNITA insists 
their exit from Huambo has to be well organized. UNITA 
Spokesman Jorge Valentim made the announcement when reacting

Nations relating to the situation of 56 foreign nationals who 
have been held in Huambo under unexplained circumstances. 
Huambo has been under UNITA control since March of last year.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Barnaby Philips in Maputo] </F>
  [Text] In Mozambique, the Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation 
Front] government and the former Renamo [Mozambique National 
Resistance] rebels have overcome a major obstacle to the holding 
of elections in October. The two sides have been quarreling 
over the size of the Frelimo army. The government declared 
64,000 men in its forces, a figure that surprised both Renamo 
and the UN peacekeeping mission, as they had been working under 
the assumed figure of 76,000 men for Frelimo. Renamo cried foul 
and accused the government of secretly withdrawing thousands of 
soldiers from the current demobilization process. But, as 
Barnaby Philips reports from Maputo, the two rivals have now 
patched up their differences. 
  [Begin Philips recording] Last night Renamo signed an 
agreement accepting that the government's army does in fact 
number only 64,000 men. Renamo's grudging acceptance of the 
downward-revised figure came with one condition, that they would 
be no final confirmation of the government's military strength 
until a further inspection has taken place in the near future, 
but it seems the hurdle has been overcome much to the relief of 
the United Nations. 
  In Maputo last week Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama said the 
issue was worrying and serious and reminded him of the run-up to 
Angola's ill-fated elections. The government has escaped only 
with a degree of embarrassment about not appearing to know how 
many soldiers it possesses. It is assumed that the 
discrepancies in numbers were due to inefficiency and corruption 
in the Ministry of Defense. 
  Meanwhile, attention is now focussed on the ongoing voter 
registration process approaching its third week. All has not 
gone smoothly. Registration teams complain of a lack of 
transport. Many remote areas have still not been reached, but 
across the country, Mozambicans are registering with enthusiasm. 
  Last week I traveled across the central Province of 
Inhambane. In tiny villages long queues had built up outside 
registration posts. One elderly man clutched his voter's card 
with joy. I asked him who he was going to vote for? Politics 
is like marriage, he told me. You stick with an old partner 
even when times are bad. So, I will stay with Frelimo. [end

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Edmundo Galiza Matos] </F>
  [Text] Dr. Aldo Ajello, representative of the UN secretary 
general in Mozambique, says that he is going to apply pressure 
so that the confinement of troops and their subsequent 
demobilization can be completed as soon as possible. Speaking 
at his usual Friday news conference this morning, Ajello said 
both the government and the Mozambique National Resistance 
[Renamo] have been making positive statements in this direction, 
but there is a need to turn statements into concrete actions. 
  The Italian-born UN official said the movement of people to 
assembly areas should not be delayed because of political 
differences since the confining of troops has been secured 
technically and logistically. Aldo Ajello said that in various 
meetings he held with both the government and Renamo during the 
week, he noticed progress in the process. He added that a 
solution to the problems involved in confining troops and 
demobilization will be found soon. 
  Butrus-Ghali's representative in Mozambique has revealed 
that 
the government has so far demobilized 17,889 troops, while 
Renamo has demobilized 3,123. The government has still to 
demobilize 31,580 men, while Renamo must demobilize 3,630 
guerrillas. Aldo Ajello feels that if these men are not 
demobilized as soon as possible there will certainly be 
difficulties in concluding the closing down of all assembly 
areas by 15 August. 
  He was satisfied, however, with the approval of a timetable 
of the activities of the Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] until the 
holding of elections in October. The timetable includes, among 
other things, the conclusion of the confinement of troops from 
the government and Renamo, the closing down of assembly areas, 
the conclusion of the demobilization of troops from both sides. 
The timetable also provides for the presentation of the final 
report on the national mine disarming investigation on 20 June 
and the conclusion of the collection of weapons, ammunition, and 
war materiel in government and Renamo depots on 10 August. 
  Aldo Ajello says he believes that both Renamo and the 
government agree that this timetable, which he described as very 
important, will be fully implemented. Regarding the training of 
the new army, Ajello said that despite the progress already 
achieved, there are serious problems in convincing people to 
join the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces because they believe 
they will be badly fed and accomodated and receive low salaries. 
  The UN Operations in Mozambique currently has 364 observers 
and 4,560 blue helmets in the field. The UN Civil Police is 
made up of 729 men deployed in 24 posts.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Rafael Omar in Nampula] </F>
  [Excerpts] Carvalho Pensado, political adviser to the 
Mozambique National Resistance's [Renamo] president, has accused 
Eduardo da Silva Nihia, first secretary of the Mozambique 
Liberation Front [Frelimo] in Nampula, of helping 34 Tanzanian 
citizens to register as voters in the city of Nampula. Carvalho 
Pensado told Radio Mozambique recently that he received reports 
that Eduardo da Silva Nihia had taken 34 Tanzanians to a voter 
registration center [words indistinct] Ward on 15 June. [passage 
omitted]. 
  Our reporting team this morning contacted Eduardo da Silva 
Nihia, and he had this to say: 
  [Begin Nihia recording] Pensado is a Mozambican. As a 
Mozambican, when he receives information, he must, first of all, 
examine it. He must try to obtain the truth before running to 
the media. It is a citizen's right to register as a voter. I 
come from this province. When I came here from Maputo, I asked 
my relatives whether they had registered. They said: No, we 
were waiting for you because we do not understand how it is 
done. I explained them what it means. I told them it was a 
citizen's right and duty to register. So, we all went to 
register at the voter registration center. The voter 
registration officials are Mozambicans. They spoke with each 
one of my relatives in Macua and Portuguese. I do not know 
whether a Tanzanian could speak Macua or Portuguese [words 
indistinct]. [end recording] 
  Radio Mozambique then visited the Election Commission 
headquarters in the city of Nampula to obtain more information 
from [words indistinct]. Team supervisor Mahomade Yusufu said 
although he did not like Nihia's attitude, he cannot confirm 
that the people who were with him were Tanzanians. [passage

  [Text] Manica Province Governor Artur Canana has described 
as inconceivable the allegation made by the National Democratic 
Party, Panade, that the provincial government is infiltrating 
foreigners into Mossurize, Manica, and Barue Districts to 
register and vote for the Mozambique Liberation Front in the 
upcoming multiparty elections. Artur Canana said the government 
is not interested in promoting such infiltration, reiterating 
that it wants peace. Panade issued a communique two weeks ago, 
accusing the Manica Province government of allowing foreigners 
to enter the country and register in those districts.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Joaquim Chissano by announcer </F>
Leslie Mashokwe on the "Newsline" program; place and date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mashokwe] The first question I would like to ask 
you is: The days before the end of apartheid -- Mozambique's 
contribution. How would you sum it up? 
  [Chissano] Well, you know, we started the struggle together. 
Actually, I must say that the ANC inspired the struggle for the 
liberation of the whole of Africa when it was created in 1912. 
We in Mozambique were also inspired by that although our 
liberation movement started much later, but not to go far back 
in history I would say -- speak to you about the years ... the 
'60s. In '61 we started organizing our liberation movements 
with the support of all the freedom fighters of the region, 
including South Africa. Around '63 we were training together 
with South Africans, Mozambicans, Angolans, Ghanaians, in 
Algeria, when all these countries came to the conclusion that 
the racist regimes in South Africa and Zimbabwe and the 
Portuguese colonies didn't want peaceful change towards freedom 
and independence, so our contribution for the eradication of 
apartheid starts from that cooperation of the liberation 
movements. 
  We got independence before South Africa and we continued to 
offer our support, to struggle together. We made analysis on 
the forms of the struggle, the tactics to be applied as times 
were changing and we came to certain conclusions which led us in 
Mozambique to be in contact with the regime, to confront the 
regime directly here in South Africa, while the ANC and the 
other liberation movements were continuing to press -- put 
pressure through the armed struggle and other forms of struggle, 
but we continued together in the diplomatic field and political 
field, both individually and through the Frontline States, and 
in multilateral organizations like OAU and Non-Aligned Movement. 
We were very much active. We ... the ANC didn't have to be 
present in order to put forward the case of South Africa. We 
were always there and we put always, as a first priority, the 
liberation of South Africa -- well, I'm speaking after the 
independence of Zimbabwe because before it was Zimbabwe, 
Namibia, and South Africa. 
  [Mashokwe] Is there a feeling of achievement? Is there a 
feeling in your heart as president of Mozambique that you have 
contributed to a worthy cause? 
  [Chissano] Yes, in my heart, as a person I have no doubt 
that 
I have given all my best, because when I speak about 
coordination during the arms struggle I am one who was lucky to 
be together with my Comrade Modise, in the offices of the ANC in 
Lusaka, or elsewhere, and to coordinate and to plan, even to see 
how could smuggle in weapons and so forth with Modise. 
  [Mashokwe] These are stories in the old South African terms. 
  [Chissano] In the old South African terms and Portuguese 
terms, but we ... it was a challenging aspect, and also it 
happened that I was the first prime minister in Mozambique at 
transition period and I had to deal, at that time of transition 
with the racist regimes, both in South Africa and in Rhodesia. 
Then I became foreign minister. As a foreign minister my task, 
primary task, was to support international forums -- the cause 
of liberation -- whether its OAU -- in many occasions I had to 
forget about the problems of Mozambique, to concentrate on this, 
because we did not feel free in Mozambique without the freedom 
of South Africa -- or there to offer Zimbabwe, in fact 
Mozambique has suffered the most ruthless destabilization and 
destruction by direct invasions from the South African forces 
and also the Rhodesian forces and later by the utilization of 
Mozambican artificially created movements. And we had a lot of 
destruction, so it was very much logical that we should be keen 
to work for the freedom of our brothers in South Africa and in 
Rhodesia. 
  [Mashokwe] What do you expect, Mr. President, from a free 
and 
a democratic South Africa? What do you expect that South Africa 
to do to small Mozambique, in terms of economic power? 
  [Chissano] To say the truth we expect the same thing -- that 
we join hands and we cooperate the same way. We plan knowing 
that the success of one is the success of the other, and we 
should wish to bring success to the other. Who can more, should 
help, who can less as we have done in the past. [sentence as 
heard] So, we hope that South Africa will be a spokesman, not 
only for South Africa but also for the other countries in the 
region, so that we have, will fulfill our plan of creating a 
region which cooperates towards integration, which brings a 
harmonious growth of the economies of the countries in benefit 
of all in the country. 
  We will not demand that the countries which are more 
advanced 
should slow the pace, but we will demand that those who are more 
developed help give a hand to the others and help them to grow 
until we can reach a certain balance, which is a necessary thing 
to create an internal market in the region, so that we, from 
that point, we become competitive as a region in the world and 
we assume our rightful place in the world -- a rightful place 
which is given to us, is there for us, because we have a big 
potential of resources. 
  Our resources pooled together make of our region one of the 
richest regions in the world, and therefore, we must know how to 
coordinate. This is why we expected that South Africa is going 
to join SADC [Southern African Development Community]. Already 
we are cooperating with South Africa within SADC -- with this 
constructive spirit, without the aim of competition but with the 
spirit of complimentarity. [sentence as heard] 
  [Mashokwe] Would you be surprised if it was the South 
African Government, Mr. President, that would have wanted to 
kill President Samora Machel then? 
  [Chissano] I would be surprised if it was the South African 
Government, but I would not be surprised if it were anyone in 
the armed forces of South Africa. The reason for me to say this 
is because when the war came to an end in Zimbabwe, for 
instance, we had a talk with Mr. Peter Ells and with Mr. Ken 
Flower, and we agreed on certain issues, and one of the issues 
was that the Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] people who 
were serving there should not be allowed to cross the border 
into Mozambique, and that they should be handed over to us with 
an agreement that we would not ill treat them, and we also would 
not smuggle in weapons for ZANU [Zimbabwe African National 
Union] into Mozambique. But what Peter Ells did was to bring 
these people into South Africa and to reorganize their fight 
from here, and together with the South African officers who paid 
the Renamo people -- so the Renamo fight was led actually by 
officers from the South African defense forces. And there are 
some who did not believe in change even after the change of 
government here. There are some who continued giving headaches 
to De Klerk and his friends, therefore whether it was condemned 
by government or not, the possibility of having South African 
security forces -- whether they or the intelligence services, 
this is a strong possibility. 
  [Mashokwe] In conclusion, Mr. President, was it worthwhile 
to 
have signed the Nkomati Accord? 
  [Chissano] Yes, I think it was worthwhile, because first of 
all it has decreased the direct participation of the South 
African defense forces in the war in Mozambique. Secondly, it 
has created a new atmosphere in the region, including in the 
minds of the whites in South Africa themselves. They started 
thinking about change in South Africa and thinking about 
business with the neighbors. There was a conflict created 
within the white community in South Africa because they had to 
judge the validity of the Nkomati Accord. That's when they 
started thinking about how to deal with the people in prison and 
Robben Island, and all this -- the Nkomati Accord was a ferment 
for us for many things. There was a big discussion in the 
world, and the fact that there was a big discussion about that 
in the world, even in the ranks of the ANC, PAC [Pan-Africanist 
Congress] and so forth, our friends and so forth, it was good 
because it was focussed more and more on the struggle in South 
Africa and the measures to be taken both by the Western 
countries, the Eastern countries, and it came at a time when the 
Eastern countries, who were the backbone of the support to the 
struggle for independence and freedom, were becoming weakened, 
because they were weakened. And so the tactics of struggle had 
to change, and so the Nkomati Accord was a culmination of the 
change of tactics of struggle against apartheid. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. President, thanks for talking to us, and 
thanks for giving us your time. 
  [Chissano] Thank you. You are welcome. 
  [Mashokwe] The bandits in your area, as they are termed, 
have wrecked everything. Do you have hope that that will be 
corrected and how will that be corrected? 
  [Chissano] Well, we have started already the work. We have a 
program of national reconstruction which is aimed at rebuilding 
all what have been destroyed, starting from the social services, 
health centers, hospitals, schools, and coming to the commercial 
network, shops, and going to roads, in order to facilitate the 
life of the citizens, especially in the countryside, in the 
rural areas, then we also ... we will pay attention to the 
reconstruction of factories, like sugar factories, tea 
factories, which were destroyed and the reopening of mines which 
were closed during the war, gold mines, marble mines, graphite 
mines which are being reopened, and other ... other activities. 
  We are also reopening the traffic through the railroads 
towards the interland countries like South Africa, which is 
somehow an interland country in some regions, Zimbabwe, Zambia, 
Malawi, and also we are serving a bit of Botswana, and Swaziland 
and Lesotho. So we are going to call for investments. We are 
calling for investments, for internal investments of nationals, 
trying to create conditions so that we create new businessmen, 
which is African, black businessmen in Mozambique and other 
Mozambicans who are not black, because even those who are not 
black -- and not many who were businessmen in Mozambique in the 
past, but we are also going to attract as we are doing already, 
the foreign investment, and through all this process we are 
going to create jobs for the lots of unemployed people. 
  As you know we have more than 1 million people who were 
refugees outside the country and more than 3.5 million people 
who were displaced inside the country, therefore, these people 
have got no jobs -- about 4-5 million people who are ... have no 
real jobs. So we aim at creating conditions for self-employment 
in some projects but also through these investments we are going 
to create jobs. The process of national reconstruction itself 
will create some jobs, but most important thing will be the 
training of personnel. The human resources development program 
is very important. The integration of the demobilized soldiers 
in the civil life is very important and again here it's about 
creating jobs or self-employment by helping them to start their 
own projects, their own initiatives. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. President, there is no peace yet -- total 
peace in Mozambique. We know of efforts, we know your 
government's position, but why should a South African business 
person go and invest in an unstable area now? 
  [Chissano] To say the truth, we have peace. There are some 
acts of criminality which are here and there, the same way as 
they exist in London or in Chicago or in Washington, or even in 
South Africa, Johannesburg, but we cannot speak about war. We 
cannot speak about the same amount of instability. 
  In fact, three weeks ago, I have inaugurated these graphite 
mines in which there is a South African company which is 
participating, and that graphite mine is placed in area which 
was dangerous in the past. We had started work. We had to put 
a battalion to protect the area but now that battalion is not 
there. We don't have soldiers there. We have taken them all 
away and so the mine is operating without need of special 
security. It has got the normal security which all mines have 
and there is a factory there. The people are living in the 
area, the workers and ... it's very active -- we have started 
exporting now this graphite, so it means that we have peace 
since October 1992. 
  We have peace so small incidents of criminal nature, of 
course, these exist, but we have a program. After we finish 
demobilization we will concentrate on the process of collecting 
unlawful weapons which are enabling these hooligans to create 
some trouble here and there. This is a process which we are 
going to undertake in cooperation with South Africa because in 
South Africa you have the same problem. You have too much 
weapons in the hands of people, but we cannot speak now of war. 
  I can say there is peace and economic activity has started 
and many investors, Americans, and Ireland investors are there 
with big projects. Some other British have investments. South 
Africans themselves have in tourism and many other aspects, so 
investments are already there. 
  [Mashokwe] Is it the old Lorenco Marques that South Africans 
used to know or this the Maputo -- the new Lorenco Marques? 
  [Chissano] No, Maputo is not the new Lorenco Marques because 
Lorenco Marques was a time of apartheid without the name of 
apartheid. I may say even that it was worse than apartheid 
because the Portuguese used to say that they didn't have 
racialism and discrimination and so forth, but in fact it was 
worse, because as far as I was informed, apartheid meant 
separate development, but in Mozambique blacks didn't have 
development. [60-second advertising break] 
  [Chissano, in progress] ... and our government informed the 
other parties that the government was not satisfied and the 
government wanted that this question and the other questions 
which were not answered that they should be addressed, 
therefore, that inquiry would give us just a lead to proceed the 
inquiry, and we hope that if there is still possibility that the 
inquiry can be made. Not that we want to accuse someone but we 
want to be satisfied that the inquiry has been concluded and 
that questions have been answered. If we find that was it 
someone outside South Africa we will be glad.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Between 1,000 and 2,000 men 
are needed for the operation in Rwanda, the French foreign 
minister said during his visit to Cote d'Ivoire yesterday. 
Alain Juppe reaffirmed the strict humanitarian character of the 
operation proposed by France. He also insisted that France will 
not and cannot go alone to Rwanda: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] We have said very clearly that our 
intervention should be given the green light by the United 
Nations. We are examining the type of resolution that could give 
a mandate to member states to intervene to save the population, 
which is the prime concern. Several European countries that we 
have contacted have told us, some publicly, that they approve of 
the principle of the operation. I spoke to my Italian, Spanish, 
and British colleagues, and other contacts have been made in 
Paris. Several African countries have also expressed their 
support in principle. 
  We are now examining the concrete modalities of the 
operation, whose duration should be limited; it should have 
precise objectives and should be exclusively humanitarian. The 
aim is to save people who might be wiped out within the next few 
days. It should be carried out by several countries. To avoid 
any ambiguity, France does not wish to go in alone. [end

  [Excerpts] French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe left our 
country this morning for Dakar, the Senegalese capital. 
  The foreign minister arrived here yesterday afternoon and 
was 
received by the president of the Republic with whom he mostly 
discussed post- devaluation issues and the regional conflicts in 
Africa. During the news conference he gave last night after his 
meeting with Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan, Mr. Juppe 
expressed satisfaction at the post-Houphouet-Boigny political 
situation and the strengthening of the friendly ties of 
cooperation between France and Cote d'Ivoire. To this end, he 
disclosed the imminent visits of President Bedie to Paris and 
French Prime Minister Balladur to Cote d'Ivoire. On the 
post-devaluation situation, the French foreign minister 
expressed confidence in the actions undertaken by our country to 
deal with it. On Rwanda, Mr. Juppe expressed satisfaction at 
the political support France has just obtained from Cote 
d'Ivoire in its quest to bring the civil war in that country to 
an end. [passage omitted] Yesterday, after his audience with 
the prime minister, preceded by the one granted him by the 
president of the Republic, Mr. Juppe spoke to our correspondent 
Pierre Adipo. Let us listen to him. 
  [Begin Juppe recording] First, I would like to thank the 
prime minister for devoting some of his time to me, despite his 
heavy schedule. In coming to Abidjan, you know it is my first 
official trip to francophone Africa, I wanted to demonstrate all 
the importance we attach to what happens in this country. The 
success of the economic reforms under way in the whole region 
will be staked here, and after this first series of meetings I 
must say that I am confident about the future. Courageous 
measures have been taken, they are being applied with a lot of 
determination, and the initial results are emerging. This is 
what I was discussing with the prime minister, but, of course, 
we also discussed cooperation between France and Cote d'Ivoire. 
You know that your country can count on my country's 
friendship. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] French President Francois Mitterand, in an 
address to a conference held at UNESCO on development, said that 
the sending of humanitarian troops by France to Rwanda is just a 
matter of hours and days. [passage omitted] 
  In a statement to the press this morning, Foreign Minister 
Essy Amara said that our country supported France's initiative. 
  [Begin Amara recording] What is certain is that, at least, 
this initiative has the merit of existing. I think Cote 
d'Ivoire, after all the explanations, fully supports this 
exercise, especially as it does not contravene the resolutions 
adopted in Tunis. The Tunis resolutions underscored the urgent 
need to bring an immediate end to the systematic massacres and 
killings and also called for an immediate end to these heinous 
crimes, which constitute a crime against humanity. I also think 
that another conclusion from Tunis is the urgency in finding a 
solution to these massacres, and it is from this perspective 
that we must consider the French initiative, which consists 
above all in stopping the killings and protecting the people 
assembled in the various camps. As you know, the UN resolution 
-- the UN Observer Mission for Uganda and Rwanda II -- calls for 
the sending of 5,200 troops, but from what we have learned, so 
far, there are only 2,900, which shows the difficulty in 
establishing this force. This is why I believe that in view of 
the urgency of the situation, it is necessary to initiate an ad 
hoc operation. [end recording]

  [Text] Lagos, June 19 (AFP) -- Informal contacts are taking 
place between the federal military government and opposition 
members in an attempt to find a solution to Nigeria's political 
crisis, a member of the opposition told AFP Sunday [19 June]. 
  The contacts were being held ahead of a meeting military 
ruler General Sani Abacha is expected to hold this week with 
traditional monarchs and selected politicians from all parts of 
the federation, observers noted. 
  "We are not opposed to any form of dialogue aimed at 
resolving the crisis. Nobody wants the nation to be on fire. 
Nobody wants a deadlock or a political logjam," the opposition 
member said in a telephone discussion. 
  He said however that neither the National Democratic 
Coalition (Nadeco) nor its affiliated bodies would compromise on 
the issues of "actualisation of the verdict" of last June's 
annulled presidential election, a quick return to democracy and 
restoration of political structures dissolved last November when 
Abacha came to power. 
  "We have told our leaders and representatives to respond to 
government offers on quick return to democracy any time they are 
made," said the source who asked for anonymity. "Nobody would 
refute the efficacy of dialogue...the survival of Nigeria is 
paramount to all of us." 
  While contacts between the two parties are going on, the 
government has stated its determination to forge ahead with its 
plan to convene a constitutional conference, beginning June 27 
in the capital Abuja. 
  Problems confronting the nation, including those that 
threaten its unity, are expected to be discussed at the 
conference, scheduled to last three months. The report of the 
conference would be submitted to the Provisional Ruling Council 
for ratification.

  [Text] The Federal Government has reaffirmed the specific 
dates for elections at various levels and the terminal date for 
handing over power to a democratically-elected civilian 
government will be announced on 16 January next year. The 
minister of information and culture, Professor Jerry Gana, 
stated this in Abuja yesterday while receiving the new British 
high commissioner to Nigeria, Mr. Thorold Masefield, in his 
office. 
  He said the announcement would mark the commencement of the 
second phase of the political transitional program of the 
present administration. Prof. Gana said government commitment 
to a return to genuine democracy was total and irrevocable. 
  The minister pointed out that the government believed that 
the transitional process should be peaceful, orderly, and 
implemented in accordance with the popular will and not the wish 
of a minority however vocal. Prof. Gana solicited the 
understanding and support of Britain in view of her importance 
in world affairs. 
  Responding, the British high commissioner, Mr. Masefield, 
expressed the hope that the forthcoming national constitutional 
conference would be able to solve the country's political 
problem. He said it was in anticipation of this that he donated 
books recently in support of the conference.

  [Text] On the political scene in Nigeria, the SKETCH 
reports that the meeting of the Northern Elders Forum scheduled 
to take place tomorrow, Saturday, in Jos, Plateau State of 
Nigeria, may not see the light of day because the police have 
been urged to stop such political meetings in all parts of 
Nigeria. It notes that the Federal Government is taking this 
measure because all political groupings remain banned in the 
country for the time being. The paper however reports that the 
police and the security agents are still searching for Chief 
M.K.O. Abiola, who is declared wanted by the police for 
allegedly declaring himself president last week. 
  This time, the DAILY TIMES and the TRIBUNE report that 
Abiola 
has escaped arrest again. The two papers say an informant told 
the police that Chief Abiola was having a meeting with his aides 
in the Surelele area of Lagos but on getting there they were 
informed that he had left for an unknown destination 30 minutes 
before the security operatives arrived at the meeting venue. 
  In another story, the TIMES reports that General Sani Abacha 
has restated his regime's efforts to bequeath a new democratic 
system to the nation through the Constitutional Conference, 
which will begin on June 27. The paper says the Nigerian leader 
has urged the organized private sector to solicit the support of 
the international community to enable the government achieve its 
objective towards a new democratic and economic order in Nigeria. 
  The GUARDIAN, reporting in the same vein, says Gen. Abacha 
may have meetings with various interest groups next week to 
discuss the political situation in the country and find a means 
of resolving it through dialogue.

  [Text] Lagos, June 19 (AFP) -- Pro-democracy students in 
western Nigeria Saturday [18 June] staged a violent campus 
demonstration, shattering the windscreen of the state military 
administrator's official car, press reports said here Sunday. 
  About 2,000 students of the Federal University of Technology 
in Akure chanted slogans calling for an immediate end to 
military rule and installation of Chief Moshood Abiola, who 
recently proclaimed himself president and commander-in-chief of 
the armed forces of Nigeria, the reports said. 
  The stone-throwing students barricaded the way to the 
convocation hall and prevented the state military administrator, 
Colonel Mike Torey, from leaving the hall until he addressed 
their demands, the reports said. 
  The students smashed the windscreen of his official car and 
wrote Abiola's name on the sides of the vehicle. 
  Torey, who came to represent President Sani Abacha at a 
convocation ceremony, later addressed the students, promising 
that the government would address the issue of last June's 
annulled presidential election during a constitutional 
conference scheduled to begin June 27 in Abuja. 
  That election, claimed to have been won by Abiola, was 
annulled by the regime of General Ibrahim Babangida for alleged 
irregularities.

  [Text] Lagos, June 17 (AFP) -- Nigerian leader General Sani 
Abacha urged the Nigerian military on Friday [17 June] to 
"distance themselves" from what he called "disruptive elements 
within our society," the NEWS AGENCY OF NIGERIA (NAN) reported. 
  Abacha said at a passing-out ceremony of military students 
Nigeria "must not continue to wallow in parochial loyalties 
which have impaired the growth of a genuine and selfless 
leadership." 
  Abacha, who was paying his first visit to Lagos since the 
start of Nigeria's latest political crisis, said "every 
patriotic Nigerian must see as highly reprehensible any unguided 
acts capable of derailing the government's democratic process." 
  He said his administration could not be blackmailed into 
abandoning the "noble cause" of establishing the foundation for 
a lasting democracy in the country. 
  The general added that a constitutional conference, 
scheduled 
to open on June 27 in Abuja, was a "Nigerian conference by 
Nigerians for Nigerians to discuss Nigeria's problems," NAN 
quoted him as saying. 
  The opposition has dubbed the conference, which will last 
three months, a "ruse" by the military to hang onto power. 
  Security in Lagos was beefed up Friday for Abacha's visit, 
with groups of armed policemen stationed at strategic points, 
NAN said. 
  Police Deputy Inspector General Nuhu Aliyu said security was 
also tightened following a report that Moshood Abiola, the 
presumed winner of presidential elections in June last year, was 
going to address a meeting in Mushin, on the outskirts of Lagos, 
to coincide with Abacha's visit. 
  The West African country has been in a state of crisis since 
General Ibrahim Babangida, then head of the military junta, 
annulled the June poll. 
  Abiola escaped a police dragnet last weekend and declared 
himself president and commander-in-chief of Nigeria's armed 
forces. 
  Aliyu alleged the millionaire politician had planned to 
recruit local thugs, known as "area boys" to cause unrest during 
the general's visit, NAN added.

  [Text] Dakar, 19 Jun (AFP) -- French Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe today strongly commended Senegalese President Abdou Diouf 
for having agreed to "involve himself in the French humanitarian 
mission in Rwanda and provide Senegalese soldiers." 
Reiterating "the excellent" nature of Franco-Senegalese 
relations, the French minister, at the end of a 24-hour visit to 
Senegal, added: "Senegal has given the example," hinting that 
other African countries could take part in the French mission, 
which, according to Mr. Juppe, could "take place next week." He 
however refused to specify the number of Senegalese soldiers who 
"will be operating alongside the French soldiers." 
  Authorized sources in Dakar have advanced the figure of 300. 
Senegal has already agreed to provide 800 soldiers for the UN 
Observer Mission for Uganda and Rwanda. During his visit, the 
French foreign minister was received by President Diouf, Prime 
Minister Habib Thiam, and his counterpart Moustapha Niasse. He 
left Dakar late this morning for Paris.

  [Excerpts] In line with their regular consultations, the 
president of the Republic and the prime minister held talks 
yesterday in Lome II. The topics discussed at this meeting 
notably centered on measures taken to ensure security in our 
country, rigor in the management of public funds and ensuring 
regular payment of workers' salaries, negotiations with 
international financial institutions, and the outcome of the 
30th OAU summit attended by the president of the Republic from 
13 to 15 June. On this specific point, the president of the 
Republic and the prime minister reviewed developments in the 
Rwandan situation and the reconciliation in Tunis on 14 June 
between the leaders of Nigeria and Cameroon. [passage omitted] 
  On the situation in Rwanda, the president of the Republic 
and 
the prime minister regretted the nonobservance of the cease-fire 
reached between the warring sides which has unfortunately led to 
the continuation and intensification of the deadly war in the 
past few days. They also deplored this situation, which does no 
honor to the African continent, and expressed their support for 
the French proposal for a humanitarian assistance to bring 
relief to the suffering people of Rwanda.

  [Text] Pretoria June 17 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela on 
Friday [17 June] said a cabinet decision giving effect to 
amnesty for about 100 political prisoners and people awaiting 
trial, granted by former State President F W de Klerk, had been 
taken in his absence and he had yet to be briefed on the move. 
  Mr Mandela said he had been in Tunis attending a gathering 
of 
the Organisation of African Unity on Wednesday when the cabinet 
took the decision. "I'm not very clear on the actual decision 
that has been taken," he said. "I will be briefed on this on 
Monday." 
  He added the cabinet was trying to resolve the matter in a 
way that would do justice to all the parties and unite the 
government. 
  The people indemnified by Mr de Klerk include former Civil 
Co-operation Bureau head Maj-Gen Eddie Webb. 
  Minister of Justice Dullah Omar said earlier this month the 
amnesties had been "frozen" and the matter was being handled by 
Mr Mandela. 
  Lawyers for Human Rights National Director Brian Currin on 
Friday distanced himself from the cabinet decision. Mr Currin 
is chairman of an advisory committee set up by Mr Omar to review 
about 800 applications for indemnity. 
  He said: "We understand that this decision was taken on the 
basis of a legal opinion received from the state law advisers. 
It was apparently not based on an assessment of any of the 
cases under scrutiny. I wish to place on record that the 
advisory committee chaired by myself had made no recommendations 
whatsoever as at Wednesday, June 15, regarding the 
indemnification or release of the persons under consideration. 
As chairman of this committee I wish to state that I therefore 
had nothing whatsoever to do with the release process now under 
way."

  [Text] Nairobi, June 19 (AFP) -- Nineteen Somali clan 
leaders in the lower Juba region supporting two main warring 
factions in the area signed a nine-point peace pact in southern 
Somalia after a three-week peace conference at the port of 
Kismaayo, a UN source said here on Sunday [19 June]. 
  The accord, aimed at strengthening the ongoing ceasefire 
accord, was signed on Saturday at Luglw-Goobweyu, some 20 
kilometres (12 miles) outside Kismaayo. 
  The pact was endorsed by leaders of two warring factions in 
southern Somalia, General Mohamed Said Hirsi Morgan of the 
Somali Patriotic Movement (SPM) and Osman Atoo, a representative 
of General Mohamed Farah Aidid's Somali National Alliance (SNA). 
  The two leaders were cheered when they shook hands and 
hugged 
one another after the signing ceremony, which was preceded by a 
peace march by residents of the area. 
  The two were due to endorse another nine-point statement 
either on Sunday or Monday which would further pledge support 
for Saturday's nine-point agreement, the source added.

  [Text] A spokesman for the Somali National Alliance, SNA, 
has said that these days armed terrorist groups are emerging. 
The terrorists, which are supported and spearheaded by foreign 
and Somali individuals, commit murders and kidnap innocent 
people. The spokesman described the terrorist acts as 
anti-human rights and anti-international terrorism laws. He 
said the SNA was strongly opposed to any form of terrorism and 
supported international agreements on terrorism and banditry. 
  The spokesman went on to say that the SNA was making 
comprehensive investigations to bring to justice those 
responsible for the banditry and kidnappings which had been 
committed in the country this year. In the investigations, the 
SNA had already got answers to several terrorist incidents and 
the identities of those responsible had been submitted to 
international organizations dealing with the fight against 
banditry and terrorism. The SNA spokesman said the Somali 
people had just adopted the course of unity and coexistence. He 
finally called on peace-loving Somali people to jointly counter 
those opposed to peace who were busy committing terrorism to 
harm peaceful coexistence.

  [Text] Tina Susman, who works for the AP news agency, has 
been kidnapped in Mogadishu. She was in a four-wheel-drive 
vehicle, with a police escort, when she was stopped by a group 
of men who forced her to get out of her vehicle and enter 
another car. 
  According to investigators, she was kidnapped for a ransom. 
The police think she was kidnapped by the crew of a car she had 
rented, and who were then fired because she was about to leave. 
She managed to contact some people and said she was being 
treated all right.

  [Text] The refugee camp at Benaco in Tanzania, is faced 
with lack of order and security caused by notorious militias 
like Gatete who have assumed the leadership of the camp. The 
president of Medecins sans Frontieres, (Bernard Grandjean), said 
that people have been killed and activities paralyzed in the 
camp. Journalists and humanitarian workers have been chased out 
of the camp by the militias. The militias also harass and stop 
people who want to come back to Rwanda and instead argue with 
them to stay in camps in Tanzania so that they can be trained 
and armed to attack Rwandan Patriotic Front forces in Rwanda. 
The Tanzanian authorities and the UNHCR should come to the 
rescue of the people in this refugee camp and also be able to 
control the activities of the militias who take the law into 
their own hands.

  [Text] Good afternoon! This morning UN Special 
Representative Alioune Blondin Beye left the Zambian capital for 
Huambo and will later leave for Luanda. A source close to the 
mediator told Radio Nacional that Alioune Blondin Beye will take 
this opportunity to hold talks with President of the Republic 
Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi, leader of the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. 
The source said the UN official will discuss two issues linked 
to war in Angola: distribution of humanitarian aid and the 
Angolan peace talks underway in Lusaka. 
  The UNITA negotiating team has also left for Huambo and it 
is 
presumed that this trip in within the framework of the usual 
consultations with its leadership at a time when the Lusaka 
talks are apparently at a standstill due to the intransigent 
positions defended by Savimbi's team on the issue regarding the 
installation of UNITA and its senior officials and the retention 
of 76 foreign nationals by UNITA in Huambo, which over the past 
two days has caused intense diplomatic movement. 
  Taking the advantage of the temporary suspension of the 
talks, the government representatives left for Luanda and are 
scheduled to return to Lusaka tomorrow.

  [Text] Abidjan, June 17 (AFP) -- "Between 1,000 and 2,000 
men" would be needed to try to halt the genocide in Rwanda under 
a French proposal to lead a military intervention in the 
country, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Friday [17 
June] during a visit to Ivory Coast. 
  Earlier reliable UN sources had suggested similar figures. 
Juppe did not indicate how many of these troops would be 
provided by France. 
  Speaking in Abidjan, the minister said the operation would 
only be carried out "under the flag and with the green light of 
the United Nations." He described the effort as "humanitarian 
operation with the protection of force." 
  He stressed that France would require the support of other 
countries "in order that there is no ambiguity over France's 
intentions." 
  US Secretary of State Warren Christopher had expressed his 
country's support for France's initiative earlier the same day, 
Juppe said, adding that it was one of many expressions of 
support. 
  Ivorian President Henri Konan Bedie had also given his 
support, but the question of sending Ivorian troops was not 
discussed. 
  The Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) has 
declared itself opposed to the French initiative, but Juppe said 
France would "try to convince it." 
  "Even if victorious on the ground, the Front will never be 
able to govern alone," Juppe said. 
  In order to resolve the conflict quickly, there should be an 
immediate ceasefire and reinforcements for UN trooops in Rwanda 
should be sent "as quickly as possible", the minister said. 
  He described as a "pure invention" the "most serious 
allegations" reported by the Brussels daily LE SOIR that French 
soldiers were involved in the April 6 attack which killed the 
heads of state of both Rwanda and its neighbour Burundi. 
  Juppe said he had also discussed the economic situation in 
Ivory Coast with President Bedie and Prime Minister Daniel 
Kablan Duncan. 
  He said he was pleased to see that there were encouraging 
signs following the devaluation of the CFA franc last January. 
  "The battle isn't won but catastrophe has not taken place. 
It is necessary to stay on course," the minister said. 
  Juppe was due to leave Abidjan early Saturday for Dakar, the 
last stage on his brief African tour, his first since being 
named head of French diplomacy in 1993.

refused immediate bail. 
  Ransome-Kuti, who was arrested on June 9, heads an umbrella 
group for about 40 pro-democracy and human rights organisations. 
  The Federal High Court rejected on technical grounds a 
charge 
of treasonable felony and intent to remove the head of state by 
unconstitutional means. 
  Consideration of a bail application was postponed until 
Tuesday. 
  Ransome-Kuti has been spearheading a campaign to remove the

<F P=106> [Article by Colette Braeckman: "Rwanda: French Pressure"] </F>
  [Excerpts] A second meeting of the WEU [Western European 
Union] is planned for this Tuesday [21 June]. And the Security 
Council still has to decide on France's military intervention in 
Rwanda for "humanitarian" purposes. Although the UN secretary- 
general is in favor, the proposal has so far met with a mixed 
response from the Security Council. 
  But France has pushed forward without waiting. Different 
sources in the Zairian town of Goma, on the Rwandan border, 
report on the start of a supervised operation on the Zairian 
side by General Baramoto, a regime hard-liner. 
  A C-130 aircraft has apparently already arrived there with a 
cargo of vehicles and other flights were expected during the 
evening and night. There are also reports of air activity in 
Kisangani. The troops sent to Rwanda have to come from Bangui, 
in the Central African Republic, Gabon, and Dijibouti. Other 
reports state that the French have apparently already crossed 
the border and are now in Cyangugu, where the Kamembe runway has 
already been repaired as Kigali airport was considered to be 
impracticable. [passage omitted] 
  This pressure, which threatens to present the Security 
Council with a fait accompli, cannot be solely explained by the 
desire to end a genocide which has virtually reached its 
conclusion. For Paris, it is a question of going to the rescue 
of soldiers who are still with the government forces. But in 
addition to these "lost soldiers" who should be able to free 
themselves from the trap--some of them are West Indian and thus 
more likely to pass unnoticed--certain sources indicate that 
France is seeking to recover from the field certain experimental 
equipment that it was testing in Rwanda and does not want to 
fall into the hands of the Rwanda Patriotic Front: Light 
mountain tanks and combat helicopters with about a dozen rockets 
on each side. 
  According to a source close to the U.S. State Department, 
the 
United States is aware that the French operation is a "cover" 
operation to conceal the rescue of two French groups, one of 
four people and the other of five, who are with Rwandan 
Government forces. They apparently want to get these French 
soldiers out because they "know too much." This source adds 
that the decision to intervene was made at the presidential 
level and not by the French Defense Ministry.

<F P=106> [Article by C.B.: "Four Years of Military Cooperation </F>
Between Paris and Kigali"] 
  [Text] It was after the outbreak of war in October 1990 
that France virtually ousted Belgium as a close partner of the 
[former Rwandan President] Habyarimana regime. It was at that 
time, when Brussels was simply evacuating expatriates and 
suspending deliveries of ammunition already paid for, that Paris 
sent a company of paratroopers to Kigali. The French soldiers, 
who increased in number to 680 men, remained in Rwanda until 
December 1993, their departure coinciding with the arrival of 
the first UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] Blue Helmets. 
  Officially, their mission was to reassure and protect the 
expatriates, particularly French nationals. However, it was 
clear to everybody in Rwanda that the French military 
involvement went much further than this: Lieutenant Colonel 
Chollet, dispatched by the French Defense Ministry, was an 
adviser to President Habyarimana. Also, members of the four 
French companies sent to Rwanda were present at checkpoints and 
were involved in identity checks on the Rwandan population. 
  Two companies were deployed in the north of Kigali, where 
the 
threat from the RPF [Rwanda Patriotic Front] was likely to come 
from. French military advisers also trained Rwandan troops, 
increased from 5,000 to 40,000 men following the outbreak of 
war. French advisers did not only create training centers but 
were also, according to many reports, directly involved in 
fighting by the government army to halt the RPF advance. 
  At the time of negotiations that led to the Arusha accords, 
when there was talk of sending a UN force to Rwanda, France even 
suggested transforming its units already present in Rwanda into 
Blue Helmets, a proposal rejected by the RPF that considered 
that Paris had been the strongest ally of the Habyarimana regime. 
  In addition to this military assistance, Paris also supplied 
the regime with arms and ammunition, and a report published at 
the beginning of 1994 by Human Rights Watch, a U.S. 
nongovernmental organization, stressed that France, together 
with Egypt and South Africa, was the principal arms supplier to 
Rwanda. Human Rights Watch also affirmed that [French Bank] 
Credit Lyonnais had guaranteed Rwanda's purchase of arms worth 
$6 billion from Egypt. The bank subsequently refuted this 
information, stating that it was simply a transfer of funds. 
  Although France's political and military support for the 
Habyarimana regime was evident, many questions remain as to the 
reasons for this involvement. The official argument always put 
forward, in addition to defense agreements concluded between the 
two countries, has always been the excellent relations between 
President Mitterrand and the Rwandan president. Rwanda, where 
fewer than 10 percent of the population speak French, has always 
been seen as part of the French-speaking world, compared to 
English-speaking Uganda and Kenya. 
  At first sight, it is not the natural resources of this 
overpopulated little country that could have explained its 
importance for Paris, but rather its strategic location: Rwanda 
makes it possible to monitor the eastern flank of the huge and 
very rich Zaire and France had allegedly planned to establish a 
military base there linking Bangui and Djibouti. 
  Information given by the "Geopolitical Drugs Observatory" in 
its 1994 report speaks of French soldiers involved in cannabis 
and heroin trafficking. 
  It was only after the outbreak of the present tragedy that 
France attempted to transfer the Rwandan issue to the United 
Nations until [French Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe, due to the 
slowness of the UN procedure, decided to go ahead and launch 
humanitarian aid more than two months after the start of the 
massacres. But this tardy initiative is meeting with a hostile 
response from the RPF which, given the past events, refuses to 
believe in the good intentions of Paris.

<F P=106> [Report by Stephen Smith: "French Army Not Welcome in </F>
Rwanda"] 
  [Excerpts] France is getting ready to intervene in Rwanda, 
despite the declared hostility of the rebel movement which, on 
the ground, is fighting for the survivors of the genocide whom 
it claims it wants to protect. [passage omitted] 
  In a last-ditch attempt to win RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] 
support for its initiative, last night France sent Jean-Michel 
Marlaud, the evacuated ambassador to Kigali, back to Rwanda. 
This triggered a race against the clock, since a favorable vote 
from the UN Security Council, which in principle should be taken 
for granted, can scarcely be envisaged if the Rwandan rebels 
continue to want to fight the "humanitarian protection force." 
It is true that France has requested an offensive mandate 
allowing it "to impose peace by forceful means," in accordance 
with Chapter 7 of the UN Charter. However, after the bloody 
failure of the Americans in Somalia, what country would send its 
men into another "humanitarian war?" Moreover, since they are 
planning to enter Rwanda from Zaire, it is hard to envisage the 
French soldiers entering the hideouts of the "government" forces 
with the acclamation of the authors of the genocide wielding 
clubs, machetes, and nailed boards. These militias believe, as 
do the RPF, that the French have come to "help" them once again. 
  Hindered by this "image problem," the French chiefs-of-staff 
are trying to obtain, for the Senegalese or Italian troops who 
are ready to participate, the right to pass through rebel-held 
territory, entering via Uganda. A military source in Paris 
explained yesterday evening: "For the Italians, we will be 
stressing their Catholicism and the many evangelization 
missions...," although he admitted that "this is far from cut 
and dried." By making a clear distinction between humanitarian 
aid and the envisaged "military-humanitarian" mission, the RPF 
nonetheless authorized the transit of 30 tonnes of emergency 
supplies sent by France from Uganda. Despite the "French 
military threat," the Rwandan rebels have even promised to keep 
this humanitarian corridor open "for regular convoys." 
  A French official yesterday explained: "We have sidelined 
the leading extremists of our former policy, which was totally 
pro-Hutu," quoting the name of General Huchon at the Cooperation 
Ministry. "However, by intervening in the west of Rwanda and 
making the government-held zone, where much of the population 
has taken refuge, a safe area, we will create a kind of Hutuland 
which would otherwise be militarily condemned. It is clearly a 
political maneuver, and, in the wake of the Tutu genocide, one 
that will be completely unacceptable to the RPF." Already, in 
his article printed last Tuesday in LIBERATION, [Foreign 
Minister] Alain Juppe had stressed "the need for a restart of 
political dialogue, irrespective of the situation on the 
ground." Where the massacres were concerned, he also demanded 
that those responsible for "these genocides" -- in the plural -- 
be brought to trial...

  [Excerpts] Within the framework of French diplomatic 
efforts a French delegation is in our country. It includes Mr. 
Gerard Larome who deals with urgent issues at the French Foreign 
Affairs Department. He held an interview with our colleague, 
Emmanuel Mugunga. 
  [Begin recording] [Larome] I also had the honor of holding 
talks with the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] president, 
Kanyarengwe. In Kigali, we met the government Army hierarchy. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Mugunga] What did you discuss with the RPF president? 
  [Larome] I think you should put that question to the 
president. 
  [Mugunga] But you can also answer since you took part in the 
meeting. 
  [Larome] The president of the RPF explained to us his 
concern 
and his position. I gave him a message from Alain Juppe, the 
minister of foreign affairs, and the humanitarian proposals of 
[words indistinct] minister of humanitarian action [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Mugungua] Don't you think the declarations of Mr. Alain 
Juppe, for whom you work, his latest declarations over Radio 
France International will be interpreted by the RPF with whom 
you have just had discussions as a declaration of war? 
  [Larome] No. It is not a declaration of war. I, myself 
informed the president that there was no question of such a 
thing. [Words indistinct] I know the intentions of the minister 
and I know (?that the) president of the French Republic 
expressed himself and that the media often wrongly translate 
what one wanted to say. [passage omitted] [end recording]

it is the same as that of most Rwandans. Given the involvement 
of France in the Rwandan conflict since 1990 up until the 
signing of the peace accord, France should not intervene, even 
if the resolution is presented to the UN Security Council. 
  Second, you yourself know that UNAMIR-2 [UN Assistance 
Mission in Rwanda] exists, in accordance with UN resolution 918. 
This resolution should be implemented. 
  What we might rather ask of France is to supply the 
logistical material so that the 5,500 troops that have been 
agreed on can be in Rwanda. 
  [Diop] In other words, even if the United Nations votes for 
the French resolution to send 1,000 French troops, you will not 
hear of a physical presence of French troops? 
  [Twagiramungu] No, indeed. I believe that there are other 
countries that would be rather interested in intervention, 
countries of the European Union -- there are some of them -- and 
other Western countries such as Canada. But, among European 
countries, for instance, we can cite the Netherlands, Italy, and 
many other countries that are neutral in the Rwandan conflict. 
Given French involvement in this conflict, I guess that it would 
be necessary for France to be able to make this proposal, but it 
should refrain from intervening in any way. 
  [Diop] However, isn't the French proposal in response to an 
emergency? 
  [Twagiramungu] We do not deny that it is important to 
intervene for humanitarian purposes, but for France to take this 
initiative...[pauses], but not only must some clarifications be 
made, we also fear that this might cause us further problems and 
that this might lead us to a conflict of a rather regional 
nature. 
  [Diop] Do you think that this is not negotiable? Don't you 
think that, if you meet French officials...[pauses] won't you be 
able to reconsider this position? Is it an inflexible position? 
  [Twagiramungu] What we also reject is the fact that France 
often takes such decisions without consulting anyone. We 
believe that we are responsible for our country, so, if there 
are decisions which can be taken, we should really be consulted, 
we should know the procedure used by France. 
  [Diop] France is carrying out consultations with the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front [RPF] and seems to intend to do the same with 
the government born from the Arusha accord, that is, the 
government you should have led. Could you possibly reconsider 
your position during negotiations? 
  [Twagiramungu] I have not been consulted and I don't think 
that I can reconsider this decision or this position unless I am 
told what is happening. The RPF, the Republican National 
Movement for Democracy and Development, and the CDR should not 
be the only ones to be consulted: We too are a political force 
regrouping the parties which took part in the peace accord. 
This is why it would be necessary for us to know what France is 
doing. But even if this intervention takes place within the UN 
framework -- given French involvement since 1990 and the fact 
that the peace accord banned foreign intervention -- it is going 
to create many difficulties for us. Other ways should be found. 
A country other than France should be involved. 
  [Diop] Mr. Prime Minister, this will be my last question: 
You are rejecting the French solution; we must perhaps wait for 
other countries to get possibly involved in this military action 
or to make up the 5,500-strong force. Apart from these 
uncertain possibilities, what do you suggest now for an end to 
the bloodshed? 
  [Twagiramungu] First, given that UNAMIR-2 has been accepted 
by the Security Council in accordance with resolution 918, we 
believe that France should rather encourage the other countries 
to provide the logistic means so that those African countries 
which have agreed to send the troops can do so immediately. 
This is what must be done. 
  Second, if France has taken the decision to influence these 
other western countries or even the African countries, it can 
also take the initiative to send equipment, that is, the 
logistic means, and nothing else. 
  Third, I believe that there should be respect for the 
officials so that they can take part in such a decision aimed at 
rescuing the country from the situation where it now finds 
itself.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer Bruno Masure] The tragedy in Rwanda: 
France this evening officially asked the UN Security Council to 
adopt a resolution allowing the use of all necessary means--that 
is, military ones--in order to protect civilians on the ground. 
[passage omitted] Philippe Rochot takes stock of the situation: 
  [Rochot] [passage omitted] The RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] 
men believe that they themselves can rescue the Tutsis and that 
they do not need French troops to return to Rwanda, which may 
jeopardize their military victory. Paris means to show good 
will toward these RPF troops by saving Tutsis--the majority 
ethnic group within their movement--first of all. However, a 
few hours away from the Security Council meeting, the RPF was 
displaying a very harsh position: 
  [Begin Claude Dusaidi, RPF envoy to the United Nations, 
recording, in English, with superimposed French translation] We 
have no contact with the French, and this morning we declared 
that the French ambassador in Kigali will be persona non grata. 
If he comes, we will arrest him and send him back to France. 
We will accept any peacekeeping force, even if it includes 
troops from France or its allies, but we do not want a force of 
aggression and we will treat it accordingly. [end recording] 
[passage omitted] 
  [Masure] Our special correspondent in Kigali, Laurent 
Boussie, is live on the telephone. He arrived in the Rwandan 
capital this morning from Uganda. Laurent, can you hear me? 
  [Boussie] Yes, indeed, Bruno, I can hear you. 
  [Masure] Can you tell us in a nutshell what the situation is 
like in Kigali this evening from a military viewpoint? 
  [Boussie] In Kigali, after 48 hours of shelling and 
fighting, 
today was a rather calm day. This precarious truce allowed the 
humanitarian organizations and UN soldiers to evacuate hundreds 
of wounded people. 
  [Masure] You had the privilege--the journalistic luck--to 
meet the president of the Rwandan Patriotic Front in Kigali this 
morning. He confirmed the hostility of the Rwandan rebels toward 
any French military presence. 
  [Boussie] You know, you know, he is called Alexis 
Kanyarengwe. He is the president of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, 
which has a majority of Tutsis, but he himself is a Hutu. He 
expressed extremely harsh words and his determination seems to 
be very strong. I am going to read to you a sentence he uttered 
this morning: French soldiers are coming here in order to 
protect the torturers. As soon as they set foot in Rwanda, we 
will consider them as enemies and do our utmost to fight them. 
As you can see, he is very determined and his men on the ground 
seem to be, too. 
  [Masure] Thank you, Laurent Boussie, for this report live 
from Kigali.

  [Text] Following the French Government's decision to 
intervene militarily in our country, the Rwandan Patriotic Front 
[RPF] reaffirms its various declarations and informs national 
and international opinion of the following: 
  1. The RPF recalls that the French Government supported by 
diplomatic and financial means the dictatorial power in Kigali 
which planned and implemented the genocide and massacres of 
several hundred thousand Rwandans. The same French Government 
through its instructors and intelligence agents trained and 
armed the killer militias of the progovernment Republican 
National Movement for Democracy and Development-Coalition for 
the Defense of the Republic and the presidential guards who 
perpetrated the massacres in April and May 1994. 
  2. The RPF recalls that during previous massacres French 
troops operated closely with Rwandan troops who played an active 
role in the same massacres in Bugesera, Bogogwe, Kibilira, and 
Mutara. It also recalls that during the resumption of 
hostilities in April, the French forces intervened only in order 
to evacuate French and foreign nationals, abandoning a large 
part of the Rwandan people to genocide and massacres. By taking 
part in adopting resolution (?1918) of the Security Council, 
France preferred to allow the continuation of the genocide and 
criminal massacres, while hiding its so called humanitarian 
rescue plan, which it reveals today. 
  3. The RPF recalls that France is a permanent member of the 
Security Council and that it actively took part in defining and 
implementing the intervention plan of UN Assistance Mission in 
Rwanda-II [UNAMIR-II] which was adopted by the Security Council 
on 16 May. 
  4. The RPF recognizes Resolution Number (?1918) which sets 
up 
the UNAMIR-II and will not recognize any other resolution, even 
an intermediary one, which authorizes intervention in Rwanda by 
French troops. 
  In view of France's past, the RPF believes that the new plan 
for French intervention is indeed dangerous, as it is meant to 
protect the killers of the Rwandan people. Therefore, the RPF 
publicly condemns the new project of cynical and Machiavellian 
intervention. It will oppose its implementation by all means. 
  The RPF once again invites the national community within the 
country and in the Diaspora to mobilize to torpedo the French 
plan, for which the Rwandan people may pay the cost. 
  Finally, the RPF urges the international community in 
general 
and African countries in particular to dissociate themselves 
from the planned aggression against the Rwandan people. It asks 
the Security Council to weigh the consequences which the French 
aggression, even with the Security Council's agreement, may have 
for the people of the subregion.

<F P=106> ["Excerpt" of interview with Gbanda N'Zambo Kwatumba, </F>
presidential special adviser, by correspondent Kimbabi Shitua on 
19 June; place not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Kwatumba] After the murder of the Rwanda and 
Burundian heads of state, the head of state immediately made 
contacts with the presidents of the region, including the 
Kenyan, Uganda, and Tanzanian heads of state. I went to see 
them in order to organize a consultative meeting in view of the 
deteriorating situation that everyone witnessed in Rwanda a day 
after the death of President Habyarimana. 
  Secret diplomatic negotiations were undertaken. I do not 
think I am disclosing a secret when I tell you that this action 
by President Mobutu was countered by some Western countries -- 
you can easily guess who they are -- simply because it was 
Mobutu who made the proposal. So the death of the poor Rwandan 
Africans was not to be taken into account. They did not want 
Mobutu to be the one to put an end to the bloodbath in Rwanda. 
That is why his initiative seemed hesitant at the beginning 
because some Western countries interfered in the process. 
  But, despite all this, President Mobutu redoubled his 
efforts 
and, as you are aware, we succeeded in making the warring 
factions -- that is the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the Rwandan 
Government and the heads of state of the subregion -- sign the 
cease-fire agreement separately. After this, you saw all the 
efforts that were made by other heads of state of the subregion, 
including President Mwinyi who summoned two meetings attended by 
the two warring factions. But these two meetings were a failure 
because both parties refused to come. Therefore, in the face of 
the deteriorating situation and confronted with the role of 
troublemakers played by some countries to hinder the quick 
organization of a meeting to solve the massacres and genocide, 
because the truth is that the horror had overstepped all 
boundaries of the imaginable, we thought that it was time to 
take it a step further. That is why the head of state made 
every effort and used all his diplomatic weight to obtain the 
subregional mini summit that took place in Tunis and led to the 
signing of the cease-fire by the two warring factions and the 
heads of state of the subregion.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 20 Jun (AFP) -- The Union for Democracy 
and Social Progress [UDPS], the main radical opposition party 
led by Etienne Tshisekedi, today strongly criticized any French 
intervention in Rwanda. In a communique published by the 
radical opposition media, UDPS said the humanitarian reasons put 
forward by France are "a mere pretext." "In reality," the 
communique said, "the French, after realizing that their 
protege, the late President Habyarimana's militia, which was 
armed and trained by them, is losing ground, are shamelessly 
preparing to give them a hand in order to recapture lost ground 
and to counterattack the democratic forces which are progressing 
in central Africa." 
  The UDPS added that France is supporting "dictatorships in 
Africa," and declared that it will hold responsible "before 
history, any Zairian who helps in undertaking any act of 
aggression against Rwanda from Zairian territory." 
  The UDPS concluded by saying that any French intervention in 
Rwanda outside the United Nations "would constitute a deliberate 
provocation against the progressive and democratic forces of 
central Africa."

  [Text] Kinshasa, 17 Jun (AFP) -- Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko 
today signed the decree appointing the new prime minister, Kengo 
Wa Dondo, who was elected on 14 June by the High Council of the 
Republic-Transition Parliament, an official source disclosed. 
The ordinance was signed in line with the transitional 
constitution that will regulate the functioning of the Zairian 
institutions up to the adoption of the new constitution which 
will mark the advent of the Third Republic. 
  Mr. Kengo Wa Dondo's election has already been rejected by 
hardliners of the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition [USOR] 
which supports Etienne Tshisekedi whom they consider the sole 
"legal" prime minister of Zaire. Mr. Kengo Wa Dondo belongs to 
the moderate group of the USOR led by the Union for the Republic 
and Democracy.

  [Text] Returning to the country where there have been 
developments in the formation of a new government following the 
HCR-PT [High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament] 
election of new transitional Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo, the 
president of the Republic not only fulfilled his duty by signing 
the ordinance to confirm the election of the new prime minister 
within the deadline prescribed by the law, but he also held 
private discussions with the reelected prime minister. Lumba 
Nakapasa asked Kengo Wa Dondo a few questions: 
  [Begin recording] [Nakapasa] President Mobutu Sese Seko 
received Prime Minister-elect Kengo Wa Dondo only 24 hours after 
the head of state's return from Tunis. Accompanied by his only 
bodyguard, the next tenant of the Hotel du Conseil spent two 
good hours with Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko before sitting down to 
table. These are sure signs that the heads of the two important 
institutions of the transition are prepared to work well 
together. Already, there is every sign that the Mobutu-Kengo 
relations will be cautious and noncombattive. Kengo Wa Dondo 
answers my questions: 
  [Kengo Wa Dondo] As you know, I was elected prime minister 
on 
14 June. Yesterday, the president's ordinance confirming my 
election was made public. It was normal for me to meet him to 
review the general situation in the country and examine the 
prospects for the formation of the government of national union 
that everyone is expecting. 
  [Nakapasa] So there will be a kind of cautious cooperation 
between the two of you, cautious cohabitation, I mean. 
  [Kengo Wa Dondo] No, we constitute...[pauses] by recognizing 
the strengths of everyone and asking for the three institutions 
of the Republic -- president of the Republic, High Council of 
the Republic- Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT], and the 
government -- to be able to cooperate. This cooperation must be 
made through consultation and I think we have to respect the 
provisions of the Constitution. 
  [Nakapasa] So when will the government be ready? After how 
long? Can you give any date now? 
  [Kengo Wa Dondo] First, the peculiar arrangement entitles 
the 
political class to begin consultations at its level, then make 
proposals to the prime minister. Politicians are busy holding 
consultative meetings presently. We hope that over the weekend 
the political parties will submit their first proposals. This 
will enable us to hold discussions with everyone so that we can 
successfully reach the necessary consensus on the formation of 
this new government in which everyone will be involved. 
  [Nakapasa] This includes the ministers from what is known as 
the radical wing? 
  [Kengo Wa Dondo] I have stretched out my hand since my 
election. I will insist that everyone feel concerned about the 
government. It is the only way to form a government that will 
satisfy the public opinion. Where they is a will there is a way. 
If there is the will, I think we will succeed. 
  [Nakapasa] Mr. Prime Minister, you know that the country has 
suffered complete disaster. There is deterioration at all 
levels. At which level will you start restructuring? In short, 
what will be your priorities? 
  [Kengo Wa Dondo] First and foremost, I will try to restore 
state authority. The state is not present everywhere. The 
recovery of the economic and monetary situation depends, above 
all, on state authority. The social aspect depends on the 
economic one. We are first going to begin by reestablishing 
state authority. We will then reorganize the economic, 
financial, and monetary environments, and lastly, rehabilitate 
the basic infrastructure. 
  [Nakapasa] Mr. Prime Minister, I can read a very great 
assurance on your face. What can you do concretely in 12 months 
of transition? 
  [Kengo Wa Dondo] I can do what the time limit permits. The 
deterioration which you now deplore can be traced to the 
beginning of the transition. If everything has been destroyed 
in four years, then you must give minimum time to those who are 
going to redress the situation. We will do everything we can to 
ensure minimum recovery before the presidential, legislative, 
regional, and local elections and install the institutions of 
the Third Republic. 
  [Nakapasa] Mr. Prime Minister, to be successful, you need, I 
think, the contribution of everyone at home and abroad. Is 
external aid guaranteed? We know that at home for example, the 
Union of Employers was very harsh about you. How is that going 
to take place? Apparently, you cannot count on its support. We 
can recall what everyone knows -- fiscal terrorism. 
  [Kengo Wa Dondo] Yes, yes, but well, actions are far from 
words. We are going to invite everyone. The crisis has not 
affected only a small part of the population. It has affected 
everyone, and those who want to work in a sound environment must 
hold dialogue with the government. The government is not 
against anyone, much less the prime minister. If he wants to be 
a man of consensus, he must cast his net wide. I would like to 
be a man of consensus and so with everyone. We can hold 
dialogue on issues on which we differ in order to reach a 
compromise. 
  [Nakapasa] You are said to have external support. Is this 
support simply imaginary or something concrete? What can be the 
contribution of foreign countries by your current presence at 
the head of the government of the country? What can we expect? 
  [Kengo Wa Dondo] First, the foreign countries can only give 
us their assistance if we ourselves make an effort to ensure 
minimum development and show seriousness in the management of 
public affairs. Its assistance can only come as a support 
afterwards. We have to make the greatest effort first. It is 
our country. We must not look directly up to foreign countries. 
This country is capable of being self-sufficient. Let us show 
that we are capable of doing something to draw foreign countries 
to our country, like it is done in other countries today. 
  [Nakapasa] What is the difference between the first 
commissioner of state that you were and the prime minister that 
you are going to be, or rather that you have become since the 
presidential ordinance has been signed? 
  [Kengo Wa Dondo] Well, there is a lot of difference. The 
prime minister is a coordinator of the executive, pardon me, the 
first commissioner of state is a coordinator of the executive, 
but the prime minister is head of the government and he has 
special assignments that the HCR-PT member has conferred on him. 
We expect to exercise all the prerogatives that the HCR-PT has 
conferred on us. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Kinshasa, 17 Jun (AFP)--The government of Etienne 
Tshisekedi, leader of the Zairian radical opposition, today 
termed the election of the new Zairian prime minister, Kengo Wa 
Dondo, as "illegal and unconstitutional." "The only legal and 
legitimate transitional government remains the one that is led 
and should be led by the prime minister who was democratically 
elected at the national conference and confirmed by the 
political class to which the head of state does not belong, in 
accordance with Article 78 of the transition constitutional 
act," the radical opposition pointed out in a communique 
published by the opposition media. 
  Mr. Tshisekedi's supporters feel that he is the only one who 
was mandated by the radical opposition grouped under the 
umbrella of the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition [USOR]. 
However, the moderate faction of USOR, led by the Union for the 
Republic and Democracy [URD], does not share this opinion. The 
URD presented three candidates, including Kengo Wa Dondo, for 
the post of prime minister. These divergent views caused a 
split within the USOR, characterized by the exclusion of 
political parties and personalities from the union. The USOR is 
currently divided into two factions -- a moderate one 
represented by the URD and a "hardline" one led mainly by 
Tshisekedi's Union for Democracy and Social Progress. [passage

<F P=106> [Article by Marie-France Cros: "Government: Limited Options"] </F>
  [Text] The reactions continue to the election on Tuesday 
[14 June] of Zairian Pime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo by the HCR-PT 
[High Council of the Republic--Transitional Parliament]. While 
the new prime minister has announced, apparently without giving 
many details, that he will seek to "restore authority to the 
state," the Permanent Mission of the Tshisekedi government in 
Brussels (a kind of alternative embassy) told LA LIBRE BELGIQUE 
what it sees as Mr. Kengo Wa Dondo's "real strategy." 
<H5>  Personal Fortunes </H5>
  According to Mr. Dungia and Mr. Bakima, the next government 
intends to make a big show in the social and economic fields to 
"counterbalance the popularity of Etienne Tshisekedi" by 
supplying drugs to hospitals (where the situation is critical), 
by paying the military so that they no longer need to plunder 
and demand money from their citizens, and by relieving the 
overcrowding in their camps. "They also want to give $50 
million a year to the [Zairian] president so that he will leave 
them free to run the Central Bank." 
  The two men stated that this money and that to be used to 
pay 
ministers, and pay them well, will come from a fund set up by Mr 
Kengo Wa Dondo's party, the financially well-endowed UDI [Union 
of Democratic Independents], thanks to the personal wealth of 
its members. "In 1991, the UDI claimed it was ready to 
repatriate $900 million to help the (radical) opposition" of 
which it was a member until the spring of 1994, Mr. Bakima 
remembers. 
  And why should such a sacrifice be open to criticism? 
"Because it is an imposture" Mr. Dungia replies. "What they 
really want is to prevent those who have been caught out by the 
"Committee for illegally acquired assets" of the Sovereign 
National Council from being judged. They want an amnesty to be 
able to keep what they have already got." Our interlocutors 
stated that on 8 June, Mr. Tshisekedi was visited by a 
delegation from the moderate opposition which "again asked for 
special guarantees to safeguard its assets. He refused." On 9 
June, officials of the HCR-PT decided that the prime minister 
would be elected. On the 14 June, with Tshisekedi's candidacy 
rejected, Kengo Wa Dondo was elected. 
<H5>  Government </H5>
  Whatever the situation, Mr. Kengo Wa Dondo's first job will 
be to form his government. By the terms of the "special 
arrangement for fair and balanced power-sharing during the 
period of transition," the government will consist of 46 
members: 28 ministers (including four deputy prime ministers) 
and 18 deputy ministers. Ministries must also be shared out "on 
an equal basis" between the radical opposition and the allied 
parties on the one hand, and the presidential party on the 
other, "to avoid a single political group from having exclusive 
control over national interests." 
  The options open to Mr. Kengo Wa Dondo are therefore 
relatively limited, which is not necessarily going to make his 
job any easier as, according to one Zairian observer: 
"Everybody seems to want to be a minister. The wrangling is 
going to increase rivalries within the alliances."

  [Text] Nairobi, June 20 (AFP) -- A Somali group on Monday 
[20 June] assailed Mohamed Farah Aidid's faction for signing a 
peace agreement with the son-in-law of former dictator Siad 
Barre. 
  The Somali Patriotic Movement, which is part of Aidid's 
Somali National Alliance, said that by signing the agreement, 
Aidid contravened the alliance's constitution and objectives. 
  "It is an accord that infringes (on) the principal 
constituency of the Somali National Alliance, conspiring 
(against) the cause and the struggle of its supporters," the 
movement said in a statement. 
  It said the alliance, an umbrella organisation of various 
factions which fought and toppled Barre in 1991, had vowed never 
to associate with members of the former regime, including his 
son-in- law, Mohamed Said Hersi. 
  The peace pact, signed in the southern Somali port city of 
Kismayo on Saturday, was aimed at strengthening an existing 
ceasefire agreement. 
  The accord, signed by 19 clan elders, was endorsed by Hersi 
and Osman Ato, who represented Aidid's group. 
  Omar Jess, the Somali Patriotic Movement's leader and the 
main warlord in the Kismayo region, did not sign the agreement.

embassies in South Africa and Japan. This was disclosed today 
by the minister of finance and economic planning, Mr. Joshua 
Mayanja-Nkangi, when he was presenting the 1994-95 budget in the

he was the one who announced the ban on trade with South Africa

  [Text] The leadership of the NPFL [National Patriotic Front

two separate delegations from the LNTG [Liberian National 
Transitional Government] to Gbarnga. 
  Speaking at a press briefing at the Executive Mansion in 
Gbarnga, former NPRA [National Patriotic Reconstruction 
Assembly] government president, Charles Gankay Taylor, said he 
believed the recent visit of the State Council and TLA members 
to Gbarnga were in line with the search for lasting peace. Mr. 
Taylor also congratulated the acting chairman of the State 
Council, Councilor Philip Banks; State Council first vice 
chairman, (Isaac Missiles); and TLA [Transitional Legislative 
Assembly] Speaker Morris Dukuly for braving the storm to come to 
Gbarnga, despite all the lies and deception.

  [Text] The leader of the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of 
Liberia], President Charles Gankay Taylor, has been giving 
details on results of the talks held in Gbarnga with the State 
Council and Assembly delegations in Monrovia. On the issue of 
two separate currencies in the same Liberia, Mr. Taylor said if 
the State Council cannot resolve the issue now, he will make a 
decision after he is elected president of Liberia on 7 
September. He argued the question of the formation of a 
national army is a constitutional issue, on which Liberians will 
have no choice but to accept: 
  [Begin Taylor recording] We made it very clear that the 
issue of the national army was not an issue that any individual 
or body in this country could object to, because it was a matter 
of the Constitution. No one can violate the constitution. The 
Constitution calls for the Presidency of this country to raise 
an Army. We have no alternative. They don't have a choice. 
  On the currency issue, they explained that in the interest 
of 
peace, they accepted the issue of the dual currency, in order 
that no matter where you are in this country, it will be 
accepted. Well, I view that as having to pass the buck, but if 
they do not solve this issue, after I am elected president of 
this country I will solve it. I can see that we are ready for 
leadership in this country. Others may not be, and we are not 
going to let these issues [word indistinct] them. After I 
become president, I will make the decisions as president of this 
nation on what will happen. [end recording] 
  President Taylor also expresed regret over pronouncements of 
the Tanzanian and Ghanaian Governments to withdraw their troops 
from the ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States 
Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] force in Liberia. He said he would 
personally interact with the United Nations and the two 
governments to ensure their continued participation in the 
Liberian peace process. President Taylor, however, said the 
Nigerian contingent in ECOMOG must be withdrawn from Liberia in 
order to move the peace process forward, but stressed that we 
need the Tanzanians and the Ghanaians here to assist us: 
  [Begin Taylor recording] We regret the statement on the part 
of the Tanzanian defense minister. Also, we regret the 
statement on the part of the Ghanaian foreign minister, Dr. 
Asamoah, on the possibilities of [words indistinct]. The 
Tanzanians are a very fine military group. They are here, we 
meet them. If there is anything that we've said, we've said 
that the Nigerian contingent must go. They have to go. We 
will not work with them. They will go. But for those units 
like Ghana, Tanzania, and Uganda, we will urge the international 
community to assist those troops, because they are here for 
peace. It is unfortunate. I will question them and will, as a 
leader of a major unit in this country, write both the Ghanaian 
and the Tanzanian presidents, and also a letter to the secretary 
general of the United Nations, urging them to do everything 
possible to keep those units here. But let the Nigerians go. 
[end recording] 
  President Taylor outlined details of the visit of the State 
Council and TLA [Transitional Legislative Assembly] delegations 
to Gbarnga. The NPFL leader said the State Council must seek to 
have an effective chairman, saying we only seem to be making 
progress in the absence of Council Chairman David Kpomakpor. 
Chairman Kpomakpor has been attending the OAU meeting in 
Tunisia, while other members of the council took advantage of 
his absence to visit Gbarnga to move the peace process forward. 
Chairman Kpomakpor, while earlier attending the inauguration 
ceremony of South African President Nelson Mandela, other 
council members also sought the opportunity to formally induct 
Mrs. D. Musuleng-Cooper as foreign minister, only to come back 
home later to accept the decision. [sentence as heard] Chairman 
Kpomakpor is said to be ineffective when it comes to making 
decisions of grave national concern, and there are calls for his 
replacement if he cannot (?do) the job.

  [Text] The Liberia Peace Council [LPC] says the first 
national [word indistinct] newspaper must retract its front-page 
story of 18 June [word indistinct] captioned [word indistinct] 
Checkpoint Accusing ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African 
States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] of Transporting Arms for the 
LPC. In a release issued this afternoon, the LPC says the story 
is of blatant lie calculated to lend support for the NPFL 
[National Patriotic Front of Liberia] charges that the ECOMOG 
supports the LPC. The LPC says it has never received arms and 
ammunition from any contingent in ECOMOG, nor has any carrier of 
ECOMOG transported arms for the organization. 
  The LPC in a release states categorically that it has not 
imported any arms into Liberia and the NPFL is its principal 
supplier of arms and ammunition since the NPFL's arsenal in the 
invasion of Sinoe County and the Liberia Agriculture Company, 
LAC, provided enough supplies to the LPC for its advances 
against the NPFL. The LPC further says Mr. Taylor's recent 
national call is part of the NPFL campaign to discredit ECOMOG 
and would not allow its organization to be used by NPFL 
loyalists masquerading as journalists who are supporters of 
ECOMOG. 
  The LPC in the release pledges support for the ECOWAS, 
[Economic Community of West African States], ECOMOG, and all 
international organizations for working to restore peace and 
constitutional democracy to Liberia. 
  Meanwhile, ECOMOG has termed as speculation the front-page 
story in the 11-17 June edition of the [words indistinct] 
newspaper, captioned War in Buchanan, stating that (?10) 
peacekeepers died at the front. ECOMOG says the story was only 
intended to embarass ECOMOG and create unnecessary stampede in 
Buchanan for reasons known to the paper. ECOMOG says there is 
no medical record in ECOMOG headquarters to accord the story any 
credence. ECOMOG noted that the paper did not seek to 
crosscheck facts to achieve [words indistinct] was an important 
element in news reporting. The ECOMOG release is again advising 
the media to always cross check facts, rumors, and speculations 
concerning ECOMOG before publication.

  [Text] The Liberian Peace Council [LPC] is again appealing 
to the West African peacekeeping force, ECOMOG [Economic 
Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], 
to be deployed in areas under the LPC's control. The LPC 
secretary general, Octavius Walker, said the LPC has 
persistently called on ECOMOG to deploy in Rivercess, Sinoe, 
Grand Gedeh, and other areas. He said ECOMOG has refused to do 
so because ECOMOG wants the LPC to declare unilateral cease-fire 
(?even though) it is not a party to the Cotonou Accord. But Mr. 
Walker told LINA [LIBERIA NEWS AGENCY] on Saturday [18 June] 
that he does not understand why ECOMOG cannot take advantage of 
their offer when the peacekeepers responded to a similar offer 
in Tubmanburg, Bomi County, at a time there was fighting in the 
Bomi area. Mr. Walker said since there is no fighting in 
Rivercess, Sinoe, Upper Grand Gedeh, and Grand Bassa Counties, 
ECOMOG should test the willingness of the LPC to cooperate in 
the peace process by deploying peacekeepers in those areas. 
  Meanwhile, the ECOMOG High Command has insisted on the 
cessation of hostilities as a precondition for deployment.

  [Text] In view of the increase in incidents in northern 
Mali and the problems of implementing the national pact, the 
question of redeployment of the army in the region is a 
prominent issue right now. We have the noncommital remarks of 
Malian Defense Minister Diocounda Traore, speaking to Muriel 
Pomponne: 
  [Begin recording] [Traore] The national pact provides a 
unique framework for resolving this crisis in the northern part 
of the country, and we believe there is no alternative. 
  [Pomponne] So there is to be no military management of the 
crisis, but instead political management of it? 
  [Traore] Not exclusively military handling of the crisis, 
but 
basically political handling of it. There is no special 
redeployment of the armed forces in the north. We are still 
occupying the same locations, the same positions. We have not 
occupied any new positions. 
  [Pomponne] Has there been any increase in the number of men 
deployed in the north during the last few weeks? 
  [Traore] Yes, certainly, in line with the strengthening of 
security in the north, it is quite normal that we should 
reinforce the units we have on the spot there to some extent so 
that they can handle their obligations better. [end recording]

  [Text] Lagos, 21 June (AFP) -- Gunmen have assassinated the 
former director of Nigeria's Defence Intelligence Agency, Muftau 
Babatunde Elegbede, in an attack on the outskirts of Lagos, 
Lagos police chief James Danbaba said. 
  According to press reports Tuesday [21 June], Danbaba said 
retired Vice-Admiral Elegbede was cut down Sunday by more than 
70 bullets when the killers armed with automatic rifles forced 
his car to stop on the Oworonshoki expressway. 
  Elegbede, 52, had also served as head of administration in 
Defence Headquarters under former junta leader General Ibrahim 
Babangida, who stepped down in August last year. 
  Police said that they had arrested some suspects over the 
murder, but the motives were not known. 
  Elegbede was shot as he stepped out of his car to find out 
what was amiss, Danbaba said. He ran a few metres (yards) but 
was pursued and sprayed with bullets. The assailants even held 
his throat to ensure that he stopped breathing, the reports 
quoted the police boss as saying. 
  Police officers who arrived at the scene engaged the 
assassins in a shoot-out and injured one of them, Danbaba said. 
But his colleagues were able to carry him into Elegbede's car 
and they drove off. 
  One of the guns recovered from the assassins is suspected to 
be a typical smuggler's weapon and is not part of the armoury of 
the Armed Forces or police, police said.

  [Excerpts] Lagos, 20 Jun (AFP) -- A Nigerian Government 
minister has openly backed opposition leader Moshood Abiola in 
his claim to be the country's president, in the first such move 
by a member of the military-led regime. "We should remember 
that in whatever we do in this country, this nation is more than 
any one of us," Planning Minister Silas Daniyan said, according 
to the daily GUARDIAN newspaper on Monday [20 June]. "If Chief 
Abiola thinks that he can attain his political objectives 
through his present stand, we will be proud of him too," the 
minister said. [passage omitted] 
  "We cannot easily forget June 12, it will serve as a 
constant 
reminder of what happened and which should not be repeated," 
Daniyan said. "I am not against June 12, it has taught us a 
lesson that we should never again in this country cancel a 
well-conducted and accepted election". [passage omitted] 
  Daniyan had been a member of Abiola's Social Democratic 
Party 
(SDP), which was abolished like all the other democratic 
institutions in Nigeria when Abacha seized power. He qualified 
his support for the June 12 election by saying that he opposed 
any move that could lead to the disintegration of the nation of 
some 89 million, which has already seen a bloody civil war.

  [Text] Lagos, June 20 (AFP) -- The National Democratic 
Coalition (Nadeco), an amalgam of pro-democracy groups in 
Nigeria, condemned Monday [20 June] a "campaign of 
misinformation" by the military government and stressed its 
opposition to the convening of a national constitutional 
conference. 
  In an official statement here, the Nadeco said that only 
Chief Moshood Abiola could set up "a legitimate Sovereign 
National Conference". 
  On June 11 Abiola, widely perceived as the winner of 
annulled 
elections held a year ago, proclaimed himself "President and 
Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria." 
  The statement Monday, signed by Nadeco General Secretary Ayo 
Opadokun, said that the Nigerian people "now have in place the 
president they have freely elected to preside over this nation 
who is now the only morally and legally competent authority to 
administer the affairs of Nigeria." The constitutional 
conference, planned by the government to start in Abuja next 
Monday, "can never produce democracy," the Nadeco added. 
  The insistence of the government to go ahead with the 
conference while two constitutions (1979 and 1989) remained 
unused was a "pointer to its lack of programme except the 
perpetuation of itself in office" and a display of 
"insensitivity" of the military to the wishes of Nigerians.

  [Text] The Federal Government and traditional rulers drawn 
from all over the country have today been meeting in Abuja. The 
head of state, General Sani Abacha, is presiding over the 
meeting. State House correspondent Oji Ogbonaya Oji was at the 
opening session: 
  [Begin recording] [Oji] In his remarks, Gen. Abacha said 
that 
the meeting was a followup to the recently concluded nationwide 
tour by the chief of general staff to brief community and 
opinion leaders on a wide range of issues of national 
importance. The arrangement, the head of state explained, was 
borne out of his administration's regard for consultation and 
dialogue as an instrument for the crisis resolution: 
  [Abacha] We invite you as our fathers to join the patriotic 
effort, to resist the tempting design of those who seek to bring 
us back to those uncertain times. No amount of incitement 
should provoke Nigerians to pitch us up against each other 
again. If the experience of our 30-month old war is not enough 
to deter us, the devastation of society in Liberia, Somalia, 
Rwanda, and Yugoslavia should restrain our action in the 
pursuance of whatever causes. 
  [Oji] Gen. Abacha described the constitutional conference as 
central to the administration's program of disengagement from 
politics. He said that the administration has encountered and 
(?promoted) all sorts of criticism but welcomed the ideas of all 
those who have criticized objectively. The head of state, 
however, warned that some self-seeking individuals had embarked 
on dangerous and desperate adventures without any regard to the 
consequences of their action: 
  [Abacha] The Constitution calls for [words indistinct] to 
help serve the cause of democracy with a clear [words 
indistinct]. A true democrat is someone who abides by the rules 
of civilized behavior, the rules which call for dialogue and 
consensus. Our desire to follow this cautious resolve should 
not be mistaken for weakness. The evidence is there for 
everyone to see that the current spate of senseless bravado 
[word indistinct] unbridled attack and smear campaign in the 
entire history of the nation. Democracy is built on the rule of 
law and [word indistinct] sociopolitical order. It should be 
made abundantly clear that the use of organized violence and 
aimless confrontation as choice for achieving democracy as 
become outmoded. Diplomacy and dialogue have taken their place. 
  [Oji] Gen. Abacha stated that the use of organized violence 
and confrontation to achieve democracy was counterproductive. 
He said his administration cannot be blackmailed out of office 
and urged all Nigerians to give the transition program a chance 
to succeed. 
  The meeting is being attended by prominent traditional 
rulers 
from various parts of the country including the Sultan of 
Sokoto, Alhaji Ibrahim Dasuki; the Alafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidu 
Adeyemi; the Obi of Onitsha, Igwe Opala Okagbue; the Shehu of 
Bornu, Alhaji Mustapha El-Kanemi; the Olu of Oyo, Abase Jalo II; 
and Eze Akanu Ibiam from Abia State. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] With just a week to go before the holding of the 
controversial constitutional conference in Nigeria, the 
country's military ruler, General Sani Abacha, has been holding 
talks today with traditional leaders. It is a followup to the 
process started by his number two, Gen. Diya. They have been 
trying to woo supporters away from the pro-democracy movement, 
the National Democratic Coalition [Nadeco]. Nadeco is calling 
for a sovereign national conference and for the installation of 
Chief Abiola, presumed winner of last June's elections as 
president. [passage omitted] 
  And it is not only the traditional rulers in Nigeria who are 
divided over the country's political future. There's talk of 
opposition to the government political program from within the 
military as well. Gen. Muhammadu Buhari is a former Nigerian 
head of state. On the line from Kaduna, Mustafa Ibrahim asked 
Gen. Buhari if he thought Chief Abiola's action in declaring 
himself president would split the Nigerian Army? 
  [Begin recording] [Buhari] No, I wouldn't. The Nigeria Army 
knows that it will be the first institution to lose its job if 
the federation breaks up. So, for their own personal security 
they wouldn't allow Abiola's interest to jeopardize their career 
and their country which they fought for. 
  [Ibrahim] It appears that the politicians are uniting. We 
have heard recently that the National Assembly met in secret and 
endorsed the presidency of Abiola, and asked the Army to quit. 
It is looking increasingly likely that the Army is going to be 
disgraced out of office if the politicians can mobilize 
civilians on the streets. Is this not what is going to happen 
now? 
  [Buhari] No, it is not going to happen, because we have to 
look at the credibility of the politicians and that of the 
soldiers in view of what happened during the last 10 years. I 
don't think the politicians have got anything to show as far as 
credibility and patriotism are concerned, relative to the 
soldiers, of course. 
  [Ibrahim] But the record of the military -- of the eight 
years of Babangida -- and the present regime is so poor and 
dismal that people are tired. 
  [Buhari] Well, it would appear -- that is the personal 
opinion of some Nigerians which I would not quarrel about -- but 
if we were to make a relative comparison of corruption and 
incompetence, the civilians have got nothing to show against the 
soldiers. 
  [Ibrahim] Would you say the national conference, which is 
going to take place later this month is the way out of the 
political crisis in Nigeria? 
  [Buhari] I agree with that. 
  [Ibrahim] Why do you support the national conference? 
  [Buhari] Well, I supported it, because it is the most 
sensible way out now. There seems to be an impasse, and the 
best way is for Nigerians to go to the conference and then go 
through the agenda as objectively as possible with the view of 
keeping the Nigerians together and making a political progress. 
That is why I support it. 
  [Ibrahim] But it appears this conference is going to be 
teleguided by the government. It is not a free discussion. 
  [Buhari] No, I disagree. It cannot be teleguided. Look at 
the type of people that are there, and in any case they have 
been elected, and there would be some government representatives 
there. I think the conference should be given a chance by all 
those who want peace and political progress in Nigeria. [end

  [Text] As the political events in Nigeria unfold, the SUN 
RAY and the CHAMPION chronicle some events by the political 
class and the Federal Government to achieve certain levels of 
expectations. According to the SUN RAY, the government is making 
efforts to transfer some policemen in their security bid. It 
recalls that this follows the escape of Chief M.K.O. Abiola, 
whom the police declared wanted after he was alleged to have 
declared himself president. 
  The CHAMPION, on its part, reports that the Nadeco [National 
Democratic Coalition] has opposed government's transfer of the 
duties of the secretary of the National Constitutional 
Conference to the office of the clerk of the defunct National 
Assembly. The paper quotes Nadeco's spokesman as stating that 
this may not address the issues affecting Nigeria objectively. 
Reporting differently, the TRIBUNE has it that the Nadeco 
spokesman said his association may have dialogue with the Abacha 
regime, provided the democratic wish of Nigerians are [as heard] 
respected. 
  The DAILY TIMES, in a major headline, writes, "Abacha Begins 
Peace Talks," in relation to the meeting the Nigerian leader, 
General Sani Abacha, is expected to have with traditional rulers 
today in Abuja on the political development in the country. The 
paper reports that the Abacha-traditional rulers parley will be 
followed with that of leaders of thought throughout the country 
tomorrow, Tuesday. According to the TIMES report, this is aimed 
at achieving peace and understanding in Nigeria following recent 
political events between the government and the pro-democracy 
activists. 
  In a related story, THE GUARDIAN quotes Nigeria's minister 
of 
national planning as stating that he would not support anything 
that would lead to the disintegration of Nigeria, even though he 
supported the cause of 12 June which should be regarded as a 
process of political development. 
  On its back page, THE GUARDIAN reports that some 
pro-democracy activists have gone into hiding for fear of being 
arrested by the police as they step up their call for the 
release of Dr. Beko Ransome-Kuti, the chairman of the Campaign 
for Democracy, CD, who was detained by the police for calling 
for a civil disturbance against the government because of the 
political situation in Nigeria. 
  The DAILY TIMES, in another story, reports that the wife of 
late Liberian leader Samuel Doe has escaped from custody in 
Lagos. It reports that the lady was earlier declared a security 
risk because of her conduct. Based on this, the TIMES adds that 
36 immigration officials, including a controller of immigration, 
have been suspended indefinitely. 
  The paper also carries a story which says documents 
detailing 
the Bakassi Peninsula belonging to Nigeria is [as heard] in a 
safe custody of a bank in Nigeria. It notes that the document 
carried an 1891 deed of conveyance signed by one British 
resident, Mr. (Alfred Dixon) in Calabar, under the Royal 
Protectorate of East Niger.

the rescheduling of its debt to Portugal. The debt is worth 
more than $1 billion. The accord was signed by Angolan Finance 
Minister Alvaro Craveira and Briosa e Gala, Portugal's secretary 
of state for cooperation. Minister Craveira said the accord 
will ease the pressure on Angola's debt and prevent spending 
scarce financial resources on the payment of debt. 
  [Begin Craveira recording] The debt has been rescheduled on 
a 
short-term basis for seven years. There will be two years of 
grace. On a medium- and long-term basis, the rescheduling was 
for 10 years, with two years of grace. With this accord, we 
have eased our situation in that we will not spend scarce 
financial resources on debt payments. We have secured new lines 
of credit to finance other transactions, amounting to about $60 
million on a short- and medium- term basis. There will be 100 
to settle our accounts with Portuguese exporters with whom we 
could not apply the petroleum (?clause). [sentence as heard] A 
financial package worth $50 million could be signed. [end

  [Excerpts] The capital of Cuanza Norte Province, 
N'dalatando, has once again been transformed into a scene of war 
by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
[UNITA] rebels. Over the past 24 hours, the UNITA soldiers have 
shelled the city with heavy artillery. By now there are more 
than 30 wounded people in the provincial hospital, and there is 
a shortage of medicine. Our correspondent Abilio Correia 
reports from the area: 
  [Begin Correia recording] After a calm day yesterday, the 
UNITA rebels at dawn today began shelling Angolan Armed Forces 
[FAA] positions on the outskirts of the city. Lieutenant 
General Manuel Jose Nego, commander of the Cuanza Norte Military 
Region, has told our reporters that government forces are 
continuing its follow-up operations, causing heavy losses to the 
rebels. More than five Armed Forces for the Liberation of 
Angola soldiers were killed yesterday. The FAA officer also 
said that the eight soldiers captured in N'dalatando recently, 
when UNITA commando and regular battalions coming from Huambo 
tried to take over the city, include a high-ranking officer. He 
said the government forces are in control of the situation. 
Since 15 June, when Jonas Savimbi's soldiers began shelling the 
city with long-range arms, more than 300 C-30 and 85-mm shells 
fell on the city of N'dalatando and outlying areas. About 30 
civilians who were seriously wounded in UNITA shellings may soon 
die due to a shortage of medicine in the local hospital. [end 
recording] 
  The sound of guns is still heard in Kuito. Jonas Savimbi has 
given an ultimatum to his men to take over the city within the 
next few days. Fernando Luis, Radio Nacional de Angola 
journalist in Bie, was seriously wounded following the latest 
shellings of UNITA. Abel Abraao reports: 
  [Begin Abraao recording] Jonas Savimbi, leader of the rebel 
organization, has given an ultimatum to his men to take the city 
of Kuito within the next few hours. To this effect, huge 
military convoys, including some battalions operating [words 
indistinct] carrying highly sophisticated military equipment are 
still arriving in the outskirts of the city of Kuito and Cunje 
commune. In the continuous shelling of the city of Kuito by 
UNITA soldiers over the past 24 hours, more than 50 civilians 
have been killed and 72 others wounded. The wounded include 
Fernando Damiao Luis, Radio Nacional de Angola journalist, who 
is seriously injured in the [word indistinct]. [passage omitted] 
[end recording] 
  The night was also not calm in the city of Malanje. All the 
night UNITA has been shelling the city's outlying areas, but its 
action was unsuccessful. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The artillery fire of Jonas Savimbi's troops, 
determined to occupy the city of Kuito at any cost, once again 
violently shook the most densely populated part of the city, 
causing many victims. The shelling that began at dawn today, 
after a few hours break last evening, are being intensely felt 
throughout the city, following the ultimatum that Savimbi gave 
his men to take Kuito in the coming hours. 
  Thus, many troops, including Jonas Savimbi's personal guard, 
were concentrated on the outskirts of the city of Kuito and 
Kunge over the past few hours. This was revealed by a source 
from the government forces operational command. The source said 
the coming hours will be characterized by gunpowder, bloodshed, 
grief, and mourning, since apart from the shellings, intense 
clashes are already being waged in different parts of Kuito and 
Kunge between the government forces and the Black Cockerel's 
men. The shells fired by UNITA over the past 24 hours killed 83 
people and wounded 127 others, including journalist Fernando 
Daniel Luis, who is in a serious condition.

  [Text] A memorandum of understanding was signed today in 
Lilongwe between the Alliance for Democracy, Aford, and Malawi 
Congress Party, MCP, under which the two parties will be working 
closer together to defend and preserve what they termed the 
endangered national unity and security of the country. 
  Speaking at the signing ceremony, the vice president of the 
MCP, Mr. Gwanda Chakuamba, urged people of this country to 
support the MPC-Aford national security initiative so as to 
achieve the desired result. Mr. Chakuamba gave credit to the 
Aford leadership for what he called their vision that the two 
parties should work together for the sake of national unity. 
  And in his remark at the same ceremony, the president of the 
Aford Party, Mr. Chakufwa Chihana, pointed out that Aford and 
MCP had no intention of derailing the democratic change now in 
Malawi, and called on all the people to work together in 
creating what he called a common security for every Malawian. 
The Aford president said he was mindful that democracy is a 
delicate thing and that his conviction was that this country 
should not be divided just because someone wants to be a leader.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Talks between Malawi's two main opposition parties 
seem to have come to fruition today. The former ruling Malawi 
Congress Party, MCP, which was ousted in last month's elections, 
used to be the bete noire of the Alliance for Democracy, Aford. 
Aford's leader, Chakufwa Chihana, was jailed for several years 
under Dr. Banda and was at the forefront of the campaign for a 
multiparty system, but both lost out to the UDF [United 
Democratic Front], who formed the new government. After weeks 
of talks, the MCP and Aford have signed a memorandum of 
understanding. It was announced at a press conference at a 
Lilongwe hotel this afternoon. Willie Zingane was there. On 
the line Chris Green asked him what the memorandum says. 
  [Begin recording] [Zingane] It appears that the two parties 
in opposition would like to stick together in checking some of 
the issues that maybe the ruling United Democratic Front would 
be following, but the two leaders that signed the memorandum are 
Chakufwa Chihana, president of Aford, and vice president of the 
Malawi Congress Party, Gwanda Chakwamba, said that they saw the 
danger of tribalism in Malawi, and this could spark into 
violence. 
  [Green] What was the atmosphere like in today's 
announcement? 
  [Zinane] Well, from the people who have been at the 
conference, they belong to Malawi Congress Party and Aford, and 
so they were cheering the thing, but from outside, the United 
Democratic Front have also got their side of the story, and they 
feel that the two parties are just coming together to try and 
give them tough time in parliament. 
  [Green] There must be people inside Aford who regard talking 
to the Malawi Congress Party as akin to talking to the devil. 
  [Zingane] Yes, there are. There has been a rumor that some 
senior members of Aford didn't attend today's function because 
they are not happy, because this is the same party that they 
fought against. 
  [Green] Are there specific people that you would have 
expected to be present today who are conspicuous by their 
absence? 
  [Zingane] Well, the vice president of Aford, Reverend Peter 
Kaleso, was not there. The publicity secretary of Aford, Simon 
Pandule, who should have chaired the press conference is in 
Lilongwe, but did not come, and rumors are saying that they 
expressed reservation about this come together. 
  [Green] What do Malawians who don't belong to one of these 
three parties think of the antics since the elections? 
  [Zingane] The Malawians in general are a bit disturbed, 
because they are saying that they voted for change, and they 
have got it in the referendum against the one-party system and 
they won, and the next thing they voted in the general 
elections, and at least an opposition party won, and they are 
saying where is the change, if people are going to waste time 
arguing and quarreling about things they should solve even 
before parliament meets next week. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with President Bakili Muluzi in London </F>
by correspondent Veronica Edwards on 16 June; from the "Network 
Africa" program] 
  [Text] Just yesterday on Network, we were hearing the 
reactions of some people to the departure of Dr. Hastings Banda, 
Malawi's erstwhile life president, from the presidential Sanjika 
Palace in Blantyre, making way for the country's newly elected 
president, Bakili Muluzi. Well, Mr. Muluzi is currently in 
London on his way from the OAU summit. Back home, his United 
Democratic Front [UDF] government has been criticized as being 
selfish in its allocation of cabinet portfolios and not giving 
any of the important posts to the opposition, Aford [Alliance 
for Democracy] party of Mr. Chakufwa Chihana. Last night in his 
hotel room, Veronica Edwards spoke to him and asked him first 
what it felt like to be taking over after so many years of 
one-man, one-party rule in Malawi. 
  [Begin recording] [Muluzi] Let me just mention one thing, 
Veronica. What is important to me is not the presidency at all. 
I think what is important to me is that, for the first time in 
30 years, the people of Malawi had the opportunity to cast their 
vote, choose a government of their choice, and at least they are 
now people living like people. Now, when you ask me how I feel, 
yes I feel very proud, but not proud because of my presidency 
but proud that at last the people of Malawi can express 
themselves. I think that is more important to me. It is more 
satisfying. 
  [Edwards] So, what about the negotiations with Aford. Are 
you still going to try hard to bring them into the new 
government? 
  [Muluzi] We have left the door open. Let me tell you one 
thing. I am one of those who have been saying that a leader 
never closes a door. We have left the door open and we are 
saying to Aford: Anytime they want to join the government, they 
are most welcome. Mind you, we may belong to different parties, 
but in the end, let me emphasize again, we are Malawians. We 
are working together. We should work together for the 
betterment of our people. I think that is more important. So, I 
am saying yes. We had two technical committees to look at the 
issues of, not necessarily collision but of working together, 
accommodating everybody. So, indeed those negotiations are 
going on and in fact there are three ministries which I left 
vacant deliberately, hoping that they would come and join us, 
and they will be welcome anytime. 
  [Edwards] But Aford seems to think that the three ministries 
that you are talking about are of no substance. They think they 
should actually be involved in (?important) ministries in the 
country. 
  [Muluzi] Let them tell me what is important. Is it a 
position? To me, a position does not very much count to me. Let 
me stress one thing. If you ask me, I have never been an 
ambitious person. I have never wanted to be president of 
Malawi. If, for example, Aford had won the election, if my good 
friend Chihana had won the election, I would have extended my 
hand and congratulated him, because I think what is important, 
as I told you, is not the presidency, but that, for the first 
time in Malawi, people are free. I think we should not be 
looking for positions, because if we do look for positions, then 
I think the whole thing is misunderstood. 
  [Edwards] If you can't get Aford, your party's minority 
position in Parliament could damage its legislative program and 
this could further alienate the northern sentiments. You don't 
want this to happen, because right now the people in the north 
seem to think they have been left out and they are angry. They 
are not happy with what is going on. You don't want this to 
happen, do you? 
  [Muluzi] No, I don't think you would say they are angry. Who 
are angry? I don't think you would say that. Mind you, in the 
cabinet we have, there are five ministers from the northern 
region. What you may not say is that they are members of 
Parliament. They are not members of Parliament, but we have 
five ministers from central [as heard] region and in addition to 
this, we are saying that we can offer three, four ministries. 
So, to say that they are angry, I wouldn't want to agree with 
you on that one. I think this question of talking about the 
northern region, the central region, the southern regions, these 
things should go. We are all Malawians, and I am appealing to 
those people who think regionalism--as I said earlier in 
interviews--that there is no place in the new Malawi for anybody 
who would like to divide the country. There is no place for him 
in the new Malawi. We want people who are going to think 
nationalistic, not regionalistic, because if you do that, how 
can you build the country? 
  [Edwards] Finally, I would like to know this: Now that you 
are president and the former president has now finally moved 
away from the political scene. How would you treat him? 
  [Muluzi] Let me just mention that he has not moved away from 
the political scene. He is the president, I am told, life 
president of the Malawi Congress Party [MCP]. Therefore, he is 
the leader of MCP. If the question is: He has ceased to be 
head of state. Yes, he has. What I have done, what my 
government has done is to assure him that we will look after 
him. He has been president of Malawi for 30 years. He has made 
a contribution to Malawi. It is something that we cannot 
forget. We will definitely look after him, give him a pension, 
befitting a former head of state. What we would like to 
actually show to the world and to the politicians that are 
coming in future is to say that there is always life after State 
House. There is always and there has been a tendency in Africa 
that whenever a former head of state has been replaced, the only 
place where he must go is prison. I think we must avoid that. 
I think politicians should have a future. I definitely do not 
believe in retribution. I don't believe in vengeance, because 
where do you stop? So, we will look after him. He is a 
Malawian. [end recording]

Afonso Dhlakama registered as a voter at the Polana Secondary 
School today. Asked whether emigrants would vote, Dhlakama said 
that was a different matter and what was important at the moment 
was for him to register as a voter. Dhlakama once again accused 
voter registration teams of failing to carry out their work 
properly, but pointed out that the situation was not alarming. 
The Renamo leader goes to Maringue today where he will leave 
for Beira, Chimoio, and Tete.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Tome Igreje in Beira] </F>
  [Excerpts] Thousands of Beira residents received Mozambique 
National Resistance [Renamo] leader Afonso Dhlakama at the Beira 
Airport today. In a meeting with local journalists shortly 
after his arrival coming from Maringue, Afonso Dhlakama said the 
aim of his visit to Sofala Province was to familiarize himself 
with the main problems facing the people as well as to determine 
what they would want to see done after the October elections. 
  [Begin Dhlakama recording] Well, I am here to visit Sofala 
Province, because I have already visited other provinces. I am 
here to familiarize myself with the political situation. I am 
here to greet the people, to guarantee the introduction of the 
democratization process. I am here to determine what the people 
want after elections. [end recording] 
  We also asked Afonso Dhlakama to comment on delays observed 
in the voter registration process in areas under his control 
here in Sofala Province. 
  [Begin recording] [Dhlakama] I think the process has begun 
to 
take off. As you are aware, it was only a few weeks ago that 
State Administration Minister Aguiar Mazula visited Maringue, 
Inhaminga, Muanza, and other areas to swear in our 
administrators. I think the voter registration process will now 
move forward. People in those areas must register as voters, 
because only those in possession of voter registration cards can 
vote. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Any comment on the manner you 
were received at the Beira Airport? 
  [Dhlakama] [Words indistinct] you gentlemen of the press 
will 
remember that when President Chissano arrived here, factories 
and schools had to close down to allow thousands of people to 
receive the president at the airport. We did not do that. 
People came here freely, and this clearly shows that they truly 
want to see the Renamo leader, the man who went to the bush and 
brought peace, democracy, and hope. These people's future is my 
hands. [end recording] 
  Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama arrived at the Beira Airport 
at 
about 1200, and he was received by Manuel Pereira, Renamo 
political representative in Sofala, and representatives of other 
political parties. Also present were dozens of traditional 
chiefs. [passage omitted] 
  During his stay in this province, Afonso Dhlakama is 
expected 
to visit a number of districts and hold meetings with 
businessmen and traditional chiefs. He will also visit the port 
of Beira, Munhava Ward, and the Beira Central Hospital.

  [Text] The Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] has 
allowed the reopening of two electoral registration centers in 
areas under its control in Nampula Province's Malema District -- 
namely, (Nicuassula) and (Leia). Benedito Vasco Verde, chairman 
of Nampula's Provincial Electoral Commission, says the delay in 
the reopening of the centers was due to a lack of transport. 
With the reopening of the two centers all Renamo-controlled 
areas in Nampula Province can now be registered.

  [Text] If the Mozambique United Front [Fumo] wins the 
coming elections it will propose to the Assembly of the Republic 
a new constitution which will guarantee "citizens and legal 
national entities the right to own land." 
  Fumo, which will continue to unveil its government program 
during the election campaign, says its constitution proposal 
contains the principle of decentralizing public administration 
-- the introduction of local governments at "district and 
locality levels," elected by direct and secret universal 
suffrage. 
  Fumo says it will reserve the right to hold a referendum "on 
federalism or other systems" in case there is "considerable" 
support for it from "political forces". 
  Fumo says its constitution will contain, among other things, 
the principle of the "right to resist any illegal order or 
command" as well as the right "to use force to repel any act of 
aggression when it is impossible to resort to [words 
indistinct], and the "right of the consumer." 
  At the request of the president of the Republic, there will 
be a "Council of State," which will include the chairman of the 
Assembly of the Republic, the prime minister, the president of 
the Constitutional Court, the attorney general, leaders of 
political parties with seats in Parliament, and the "(?whip)." 
This council will have the task of advising the president of 
the Republic. 
  In Fumo's constitution, the prime minister is appointed by 
the president of the Republic "with advice from the most voted 
for party," while the remaining members of the government are 
also appointed by the president of the Republic "with advice 
from the prime minister."

<F P=106> [Report by Christo Retief] </F>
  [Excerpts] The controversy over the land issue affecting 
the government of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe is likely 
to be repeated in Namibia after government plans were revealed 
yesterday on the proposed awarding of farms to former PLAN 
[People's Liberation Army of Namibia] fighters as a means of 
compensating them for their "services during the freedom 
struggle." 
  Several senior government officials, and especially serving 
officers of the Namibian Defense Force, are also named as 
beneficiaries of the plan in which, among other things, 
provision is made for the "expropriation" of farms being used by 
the National Development Corporation (NDC) in Kavango for beef 
production. The project includes the handing over of altogether 
five NDC farms, comprising more than 24,000 hectares in the 
Kavango Mangetti region, to the Namibian Defense Force to begin 
a farming project. 
  The reason for the army taking over farming activities is 
apparently to make the Ministry of Defense less dependent on the 
private sector for the provision of meat and vegetables to 
military units in the north. Confidential sources in the 
defense force say that the once the development of this gigantic 
farm is completed at state cost it will be handed over to the 
former fighters. 
  According to documents in the possession of DIE REPUBLIKEIN, 
the awarding of farms to former members of SWAPO's [South-West 
African People's Organization] armed wing, PLAN, is taking place 
under the guise of a resettlement project. An inter-ministerial 
pilot committee comprising the Ministry of Land Affairs, 
Resettlement and Rehabilitation, the Ministry of Agriculture, 
Water and Rural Development, the Ministry of Information and 
Broadcasting, and the NDC has already been established to 
finalize the project. The former fighters are represented by 
the "SWAPO Veteran's Trust," who liaises directly with the new 
committee through a representative, Mr. Mzee Kaukungwa, also a 
prominent SWAPO leader and member of the party's Central 
Committee. The SWAPO organization for war veterans, in 
collaboration with the pilot committee, is also responsible for 
the appointment and approval of PLAN members who will qualify 
for farms. 
  An initial list of approximately 200 former PLAN members was 
rejected by the technical committee under the chairmanship of 
the permanent secretary of Land affairs, Resettlement and 
Rehabilitation, Mrs. Ulitala Hiveluah, after members of the 
committee found that names of people on the list included those 
of people who had died under unknown circumstances in the bush 
war. A second list with approximately 100 names is being 
studied by the committee. 
  Several of the former fighters are hailed as "war heroes of 
SWAPO" and are also the relatives or recipients of the so-called 
Ongulumbashe medals. The secret project was approved by the 
cabinet on 18 January this year after which an order, not a 
request, was issued to begin with the identification and 
demarcation of suitable farming land in the Okavango Mangetti 
region. 
  The setting up of infrastructure such as bore holes and 
fences on the farms, the upgrading of roads, the provision of 
accommodation and telephone links, a clinic and even a school, 
will be carried out at an initial cost of approximately 12 
million Namibian dollars before the farms are handed over to the 
beneficiaries. An amount of 1 million dollars has already been 
made available from state funds for the purchasing of livestock 
for the former PLAN members, while an unknown amount from the 
budget of the Ministry of Land Affairs will be contributed 
towards the resettlement fund for the new community. [passage 
omitted] 
  Yesterday the government denied any knowledge of the two 
projects -- which has to be started before the forthcoming 
presidential general and presidential elections (that is the 
former PLAN farms and the army farms) -- at the highest level. 
[passage omitted] 
  The official spokesman for the NDC, Mr. Mathew Gowaseb, 
confirmed the existence of the two projects but referred all 
enquiries to the head of the agricultural department, Mrs. Anna 
Shiwedha. She was not available for comment, however. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Aid organizations say a quarter of Zimbabwe's 
population in remote rural districts is facing food shortages, 
two years after surviving one of the worst droughts in its 
history. The organizations say although Zimbabwe has surplus 
food in reserve, the country's southern areas were running 
desperately short. 
  The provincial administrator for Zimbabwe's southern 
Masvingo 
Province, Mr. Alphonse Chikurira, said some districts had never 
recovered fully from the devastating drought. Mr. Chikurira 
said 20 percent of the 2,100,000 people in Zimbabwe's Masvimgo 
Province had registered for drought relief this year, compared 
with about 80 percent during the 1992 drought. 
  Officials estimated that about $18.5 million would be 
required this year to buy food for the needy in Masvingo, 
southwestern Matabeleland, and eastern Manicaland Provinces.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Wandile Zote from the "Newsline </F>
program; italicized passages in vernacular] 
  [Text] [Zote] This was not a flight over enemy territory by 
SADF [South African Defense Force] war planes, as they used to 
do in the past. It was a fly-past to mark the dawn of a new 
political era in South Africa. This was 10 May this year, 
during the inauguration of South Africa's first black president, 
Nelson Mandela. 
  Not far from the podium where a few minutes ago Mandela had 
taken the oath of office stood the new National Defense Force in 
its new uniform. Next to President Mandela stood the chief of 
the National Defense Force [NDF], General Georg Meiring, the man 
entrusted with the task of molding the new army. In spite of 
his past as the chief of the SADF, which fought viciously to 
defend apartheid, Meiring has earned the respect of some, if not 
all, of his former enemies. 
  His major task of integrating the SADF, Umkhonto we Sizwe 
[Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing; MK], the Azanian 
People's Liberation Army [APLA], as well as the armies of the 
former TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states, is 
a daunting one, indeed. The process got off to a shaky start a 
few months ago, when MK recruits at Wallmannsthal stoned and 
torched the car of their chief of staff, Siphiwe Nyanda. Their 
complaints varied from poor catering services and facilities to 
allegations of racism by former SADF officers. These, however, 
have been denied by MK commanders at Wallmannsthal. 
  [Former MK Commander Stephen Kobe] The company which is 
supplying the food now is a new company. That was from the 
first company which was catering, which was supplying food here. 
  [Zote] Did that have anything to do with racism? 
  [Kobe] No, no. It was just the spoiled kind of food. 
  [Zote] Wallmannsthal is situated north of Pretoria, and it 
is 
here that former MK cadres are assembled in preparation for 
integration into the National Defense Force. On arrival at this 
assembly area, young men and women have their names checked 
against a list submitted by their regional commanders. It is 
this process of registration that has become a source of 
conflict between former cadres and their commanders at 
Wallmannsthal. 
  [First unidentified MK cadre, in English and Xhosa] The only 
thing that can fix this problem is the MK and the 
state president. The commander in chief of the army must 
intervene because we could not have stayed in 
Angola for so many years. The next thing, when we go 
back to the army, awaiting integration, then we find there are 
people who do not appear in the MK list. 
  [Second unidentified MK cadre, in Xhosa] Those that 
have been chased away, what have they come back to do? This is 
not right, these Boers are fooling with us. 
  [Third unidentified MK cadre, in Zulu] My problem is 
that these guerrillas who were sent back home must be taken in, 
and these other recruits should be sent away so that everything 
can run smoothly. Otherwise there is going to be corruption 
around here. 
  [Zote, in Zulu] Which recruits are you talking about, 
sister? 
  [Third unidentified MK cadre, in Zulu] These SDUs 
[self-defense units] all over this place and those trained 
at KwaMashu, wherever, Johannesburg, they should be sent away 
and then all the authentic guerrillas should replace them. 
  [Zote] The task of winning the hearts and minds of the 
soldiers in the new NDF is giving military planners sleepless 
nights. They now admit they knew from the start that 
integration will not be an easy process. Recently about 2,000 
new recruits were dismissed from Wallmannsthal, because their 
names did not appear on the submitted list, and some of them 
were not members of MK. Not willing to accept their fate, the 
recruits, still carrying their personal belongings, marched on 
Shell House, the ANC headquarters in Johannesburg, to register 
their protest. 
  In a bid to appease its members, the ANC accused the 
commanders at Wallmannsthal of high-handedness. This is 
surprising, considering that former MK commanders who are now 
based at Wallmannsthal actually endorsed the dismissals. In 
fact, those commanders have criticized the ANC for politicizing 
what they perceive as a military matter. 
  [Former MK Commander Edward Mabiletsa] The communication 
lines between ourselves as former full-time members of the ANC 
are gradually being eroded, because there is a requirement that 
for us to proceed with the integration of the armed forces, and 
to continue a career as professional soldiers, we have to be 
apolitical. We do not represent the ANC in Wallmannsthal, or 
any other party. So there is a deliberate move on our part to 
erode that kind of link. 
  [Zote] Colonel Terence Murphy is from the old SADF, and Mr. 
Gilbert Ramano is an MK veteran, and they are both at the helm 
of the integration process at Wallmannsthal. They are both 
confident about the success of the process, and they say no 
problem at Wallmannsthal is insurmountable. To underline his 
commitment to the new South Africa, Mr. Ramano says he wants to 
see an end to the singing of freedom songs at the army base. He 
says the songs are no longer desirable in the new army, which 
seeks to be nonpolitical. 
  Meanwhile, political mudslinging between Gen. Meiring and 
commanders of the former liberation armies about how integration 
should be handled have added another dimension to the problem. 
Media reports quote Gen. Meiring as having said a minimum of 30 
years in the army would be required before anyone could qualify 
to become a general in the new army. Both APLA and MK have 
described Meiring's utterances in this regard as irresponsible. 
One may as well ask who should determine the standards for the 
new NDF. 
  [Meiring] There are a number of people in the nonstatutory 
forces that served for a long time. The present minister served 
for more than 30 years in this capacity, so if he were to be in 
the NDF as such, he could be aspiring for such a rank. 
  [Nyanda] Statements which are made about qualifications into 
the general staff, or into the higher echelons of the military 
establishment, may be irritating, but in some instances, in many 
instances, they actually are correct. I think if, for instance, 
there are appointments from our ranks into that general staff -- 
if I am appointed, for instance, into the general staff -- it 
will indeed be a political appointment, but it does not mean 
that we are not equal to the tasks, and of course, it is an 
exaggeration to say 30 years. 
  [APLA Chief Commander General Daniel Mofokeng] Our view will 
be that the issue must be discussed thoroughly with all the 
forces involved, and as you are saying correctly, that is a 
criterion, or the former SADF criterion. But inasfar as the age 
is concerned, that will have to be discussed thoroughly. In any 
case, when coming to the appointment of generals, it is a 
question of the cabinet and the Parliament. 
  [Zote] There is also disagreement about the racial 
composition of the new army, and whether affirmative action can 
be applied without sacrificing the high standards required of a 
modern army. Georg Meiring believes it is not necessary for the 
army to reflect the nature of the South African society in its 
composition. However, Siphiwe Nyanda disagrees, and he feels 
affirmative action is necessary to address the imbalances of the 
past, where the number of blacks in the old SADF was kept down. 
  [Meiring] The NDF will not, of necessity, reflect a specific 
stature of the country as a whole. It will contain the best 
people for the job in a colorless society. 
  [Nyanda] The South African National Defense Force would 
reflect to a large degree South African society. However, the 
echelons, the hierarchy, the top echelons of the South African 
National Defense Force would not in the short term -- we hope 
that in the immediate and long term it will. 
  [Zote] While the integration of all other armies is taking 
place, APLA's position in the new national defense force remains 
unclear. Gen. Meiring says APLA cadres who wish to join the 
army can only do so as individuals. This, he says, is because 
the PAC was not represented in the Transitional Executive 
Council [TEC] subcouncil on defense which drew up the guidelines 
for the integration process. 
  [Meiring] No APLA member was on a list. In fact, APLA didn't 
form part of the process, the TEC process until that time more 
or less, and there was not a list presented by APLA to include 
their cadres to be included into the SANDF. Therefore, the APLA 
members are not automatically members of the SANDF. 
  [Mofokeng] We are still here engaged in the process of 
integrating APLA as an organ, and APLA as a structure, and the 
issue of APLA being integrated is at the level of the 
presidency. I think you will remember that Comrade Makwetu, the 
president of the Pan-Africanist Congress, met the head of state, 
Comrade Nelson Mandela, to discuss about the issue. 
  [Zote] Inspite of all the problems that have occurred during 
these early stages of the integration process, all sides are 
optimistic about its success. The big test, however, will come 
during the second stage of integration when former MK and APLA 
cadres meet their former enemies from the SADF at the barracks. 
In military circles hopes for reconciliation between former 
enemies are in danger of turning into distrust. Since the birth 
of a new South Africa there have been reports of ugly incidents 
at barracks. Whether a solution will be found in time before the 
situation slides further into anarchy remains to be seen.

  [Text] COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions] has 
rejected the criticism by the commissioner of police, General 
Johan van der Merwe, of the so-called truth commission. COSATU 
said that among other things it wanted to know who was 
responsible for the murder and disappearance of trade union 
members during the apartheid regime, and for the explosion at 
COSATU House. COSATU said that Gen. van der Merwe's criticism 
was suspect after the attempt by the head of the SANDF [South 
African National Defense Force], Gen. George Meiring, to obtain 
a court order against the publication of covert army operations. 
It is reported that the minister of justice, Mr. Dullah Omar, 
has indicated that the truth commission will go ahead despite 
Gen. van der Merwe's opposition.

  [Text] The South African Chamber of Business, SACOB, says 
the financial rand and exchange control systems have outlived 
their usefulness and they are sending the wrong messages to 
international investors. SACOB says in a discussion document 
that South Africa's changed international status, and a need to 
create a more favorable climate for foreign investment, make it 
necessary for the government to review its position on exchange 
control. It says the government should commit itself as soon as 
possible to the phasing out of the exchange control system when 
the country's foreign reserves return to satisfactory levels.

  [Text] The dust surrounding the fuel price refuses to 
settle, and it looks as though the government is beginning to 
yield to pressure to deregulate it. 
  Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Pik Botha has announced 
that the government has requested a fuel task force to make 
proposals by August for a new way to determine the fuel price. 
Mr. Botha today said in a media information session that the 
extent to which the government should get involved in the fuel 
industry must also be looked at. The task force will make 
proposals on the degree to which the fund should buy and sell, 
and will also look at the tariff protection of SASOL [South 
African Coal, Oil and Gas Corporation] and Mossgas [Mossel Bay 
Gas Project]. Mr. Botha said the government wanted to 
depoliticize the fuel issue and find an answer that will best 
benefit the consumer. 
  Meanwhile, the director general of Pick 'n Pay, Mr. Gareth 
Ackerman, announced that from Monday the chain store group will 
sell its gas at the recommended price. He said in a message to 
branch managers that he had held discussions with Mr. Botha, and 
progress had been made in efforts to deregulate the fuel price.

  [Text] Cape Town June 20 SAPA -- The National Party's [NP] 
priority was to play a constructive role in the government of 
national unity and make it succeed, NP leader F W de Klerk said 
on Monday [20 June]. Facing questions from the media on his and 
his party's new role at a NP briefing, he said he was impressed 
by the commitment of all the new cabinet members to ensure that 
the government of national unity was a success. 
  He refused to evaluate the performance of individual members 
of the cabinet, but said he had sympathy with any new member. 
"It takes some adaptation--even a change of portfolios makes 
heavy demands in getting to know your officials and to get on 
top of issues." 
  The NP's newly constituted 60-member Federal Council had 
just 
held its first meeting where the party's goals as South Africa's 
second largest party were set out. The NP was still committed 
to the present electoral principle of proportional 
representation but had charged a commission to look into 
possible changes in the electoral system. He hoped the next 
election would be held on the basis of electoral lists compiled 
through proper registration procedures. 
  Asked about charges that he had snubbed invitations to 
attend 
certain functions, Mr de Klerk repeated that he had had prior 
engagements and that he did not believe in cancelling one 
engagement in order to accept another, later, invitation. 
  "But there is an element within the ANC -- and it is their 
right -- who see me as the enemy and will do anything to harm 
me. My co-operation is fully constructive but I am also leader 
of the NP and not invited into the government. I am there 
because I was voted there by four million people and because the 
constitution says I have a right to be there." 
  He was not there as part of president Nelson Mandela's team. 
"I do not think I should attend functions of a party political 
nature of other parties as a regular exercise." 
  He was comfortable with his new role. He had prepared 
himself for it psychologically before the election, "and besides 
it was our party's policy that there should be powersharing". 
  Mr de Klerk gave oblique approval to the removal of the 
Verwoerd name and bust from Cape Town's ministerial headquarter 
buildings. He would personally not like to have his ministerial 
office in a building named after the leader of a political party 
about which he had very negative feelings. Name-changes in 
general should however not develop into a rampage of pulling 
down statues. "Name changes are in general a very emotional 
issue, one cannot write or decide history out of existence."

  [Text] National Party [NP] leader F.W. de Klerk says the 
constitution should be amended to make provision for the 
establishment of a new party without members of parliament being 
forced to resign from their posts. 
  Speaking in a news conference in Cape Town, Mr. de Klerk 
said 
that according to the present constitution a large group within 
a political party was not permitted to break away and form a new 
party. Mr. de Klerk added that although he was in favor of 
proportional representation being retained in the new 
constitution, geographical representation should be incorporated 
as well. He also announced that the NP, until now made up of 
four provincial parties, would become one federal party.

  [Text] Durban June 20 SAPA -- The choice of capital for 
KwaZulu/Natal will be discussed at a Provincial Cabinet meeting 
in Pietermaritzburg on Tuesday [21 June], a day after the 
African National Congress leader in the province criticised the 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] national leadership of "interfering" 
in the debate. The 11-member executive is to meet on Tuesday 
for its weekly gathering, the first since its three ANC MECs 
[members of the Executive Committee] boycotted the previous one 
in Ulundi. 
  On Monday, ANC KwaZulu/Natal leader Jacob Zuma told a Durban 
press conference he would take the opportunity on Tuesday to 
solve the mounting crisis surrounding the choice of capital. 
But, he warned, the province was "heading for trouble" if the 
IFP went ahead with its unilateral plan to hold the first 
meeting of the legislature in Ulundi next week. 
  Mr Zuma repeated the ANC's plan to boycott this meeting and 
he criticised IFP leader and Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi for meddling in the province's affairs. He was 
reacting to Mr Buthelezi's reported threats at the weekend to 
expel IFP members if they favoured Pietermaritzburg over Ulundi 
as the capital. 
  Mr Buthelezi, he said, was behind the move to make Ulundi a 
provisional capital: "He has clearly discussed the matter in 
public and has been openly confrontational on the issue." 
  If "national figures stopped interfering...if we are left 
alone we could work it out," Mr Zuma said, but added that 
central government would be forced to intervene if the issue was 
not resolved. He said that if central government was not 
convinced the region was ready to govern it would withhold 
powers from the province. 
  Mr Zuma said the Transitional Executive Council had decided 
before elections that Pietermaritzburg should act as a 
provisional capital until the first sitting of the legislature 
settled the permanent capital venue. He said the issue should 
be discussed openly by the elected representatives of the 
province and all parties should abide by their choice. 
  KwaZulu/Natal premier Dr Frank Mdlalose said on Monday the 
issue would be discussed at Tuesday's cabinet meeting. Dr 
Mdlalose repeated his personal preference for Ulundi as a 
capital, but added that no final decision had been taken and 
"the IFP will weigh all evidence carefully before making a final 
decision". 
  He suggested a commission should examine the issue and make 
recommendations, which could take up to two months, and then a 
referendum should be held to test residents' support for either 
Ulundi or Pietermaritzburg.

<F P=106> [By Adrian Hadland] </F>
  [Text] PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region 
officials claim that incidents of bureaucratic sabotage by 
employees of the Transvaal Provincial Administration [TPA] are 
hampering efforts to set up the new provincial government. 
  A PWV region source said the offices of newly elected 
legislators were encountering "deliberate resistance", including 
the loss of documents and ignored requests for equipment and 
information from TPA department officials in Pretoria. 
  "We thought at first it was just a few incompetent people, 
but the loss of strategic documents and problems in specific 
areas lead us to believe this is sabotage," the source said. 
  TPA officials, however, claim provincial premiers and 
legislators have been appointing dozens of new people to posts 
not sanctioned by the Commission for Administration. They 
contend the filling of new posts must follow procedures laid 
down in the public service's personnel administration system. 
This involves a work study investigation to evaluate the post 
and its place in the grading system as well as minimum 
qualifications for applicants. 
  TPA officials felt that while they were keen to support and 
assist the new provincial government as apolitical public 
servants, they could not agree to demands from people who had 
not been formally placed in the official structures of the 
public service as laid down in legislation. "Even premiers do 
not have the authority just to appoint people." 
  Commission for Provincial Government chairman Thozamile 
Botha 
said mechanisms were being established that would better 
integrate public servants with newly appointed provincial 
officers and legislators. 
  Strategic management teams were being established in all 
provincial departments to help bridge the gulf between the old 
and new administrations. These teams would assist in 
communications between departmental tiers, improve access to 
information and deal with employee grievances and uncertainties. 
  A TPA official said, however, that new structures could not 
be set up outside the present official structures. 
  The PWV source said the culture of secrecy still 
predominating in the public service, together with uncertainty 
over authority structures, had contributed to the problems. 
"Nobody knows who's the boss or how seriously they should take 
requests from people they have never heard of. Mostly we have 
to rely on goodwill, and this is not always forthcoming." 
  Access to demographic and research information had proven 
particularly difficult. This was having a significant effect on 
the province's ability to get started, the source said.

<F P=106> [Report by Mzimkulu Malunga] </F>
  [Text] Nobody can quantify the actual cost of the 
Government's Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP] says 
the head of the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] 
Commission, Professor Ben Turok. 
  "I think the whole attempt to put a price tag on the RDP was 
a mistake. It is too big a programme for anybody to try and 
quantify," he says, arguing that the RDP should be treated in 
the same way as the Marshall Plan which Western countries put 
into place after the Second World War to help Western Europe 
recover from the war. 
  He is adamant that determining the cost of the RDP does not 
allay investors' fears either, particularly when there is no 
consensus on the actual cost. 
  Turok is confident that the programme can be financed 
through 
savings in both the national and provincial budgets. There are 
a number of items that have been included in the previous 
budgets which can be safely ignored and resources directed 
elsewhere, he argues. 
  At national level, every single Government department is 
being scrutinised to identify possible areas where money can be 
saved to finance the RDP. 
  One saving strategy will be to cut down the bureaucracy and 
increase efficiency. However, he goes on to say that watering 
down the bureaucracy will not amount to large-scale dismissals 
of people as there are already a lot of jobs left vacant by 
people who quit when South Africa's new era unfolded. 
  "These jobs that I am talking about are in the budget so we 
do not need additional money to pay people who will fill them, 
we just need to advertise them, that's all," says Turok. 
  "The problem is not as big as we thought. For instance, I 
was in a meeting with other government officials a few days ago 
and we identified R1 million [rands] within minutes," he says. 
  Turok says there is money that could be found within 
government structures as well; an organisation like the 
Transvaal Provincial Administration [TPA] has a budget of R6 
billion and that money will be going to the PWV government. 
  It is estimated that the eventual budget for the PWV will 
about R12 billion. 
  He says the TPA is likely to be charged with new 
responsibility so that it falls in line with the RDP. 
  Turok says the R2.5 billion which President Nelson Mandela 
announced as initial funding for RDP came from savings. 
  This long-time Pan-African economist is in favour of duties 
on luxury goods such as tobacco and liquor, arguing that the 
money coming from such tariffs could create many more jobs 
elsewhere. 
  As for tax increases, Turok believes the forthcoming budget 
will not see any hikes in taxes. "The key lies with the 
expansion of the economy not in tax increases," he says. 
  While many expect a public works programme to "kickstart" 
the 
economy, Turok says the main focus in the PWV will be 
nonstimulating productive capacity. 
  Many of the projects will be based in and around the 
townships, and black business will play a key role in ensuring 
that this programme bears fruit. 
  As for the role of multilateral institutions such as the 
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Turok says the 
emphasis of the new government is not on borrowing but on 
investment. 
  He says he is happy to see a new sense of realism among 
economic commentators in the country. Prior to the elections 
the mass media were beating the drums of borrowing, but now 
everybody is aware of the consequences of such a move. 
  In the 1970s many African countries went on a borrowing 
spree 
and the debt-accumulated interest rates steadily climbed to the 
extent that by the mid-eighties Africa found itself in a deep 
debt crisis. 
  Today Africa's debt is about a trillion rands. In some 
countries debt repayments swallow up to 40 percent of the total 
value of goods and services produced in any given year. 
  However, this country cannot ignore these powerful financial 
institutions. South Africa could still benefit from the 
analytical studies that these organisations conduct from time to 
time, he says. 
  "At times their recommendations make a lot of sense," says 
Turok, pointing to the fact that in one of its recent studies on 
this country, the World Bank suggests a redirection of resources 
to disadvantaged areas. The study, according to Turok, says 
that the re-allocation of resources from white to black areas 
will mean that no additional money will be needed to finance the 
reconstruction of the townships. 
  On foreign money generally, he says: "We are quite happy 
with 
grants, but a bit cautious with loans."

<F P=106> [Report by Musa Zondi and Mapula Sibanda] </F>
  [Text] A plan for East Rand residents to pay a levy of 
R2.10 [rand] a month for a neighbourhood watch programme by the 
controversial Self-Defence Units [SDU] has been proposed by a 
member of the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] 
legislature, Mr Obed Bapela. Bapela proposed the plan yesterday 
at a meeting attended by more than 200 SDU members. The meeting 
was seeking ways and means of reintegrating members of the SDUs 
into society. 
  Also present were MEC [Member of the Executive Committee] 
for 
Safety and Security Jesse Duarte and Education MEC Mary Metcalf. 
  Bapela said the levy would fall under a general services 
charge to help reinstate "a culture of payment". 
  The campaign is centred on creating jobs for the unemployed 
members of the defence units and to send them back to school 
should they so wish. 
  Speaking yesterday at Katlehong's Las Vegas hall, Metcalf 
told members of SDUs on the East Rand that those who had the 
responsibility of defending the community should be afforded the 
chance to learn. The plan for education rested on two pillars: 
what to do with those who wanted to go back to school or those 
who thought it unlikely they would go back. 
  The education plan would comprise four phases: 

  -  A go-back-to-school programme for those between the ages 
of 13 and 18; 
  -  A programme for the 19-to-25-year-olds willing to go to 
school 
and to integrate those unwilling to return to school into the 
police force or reservists; 
  -  An illiteracy-combating programme which would also involve 
life-skills training; and 
  -  Psychological and counselling support for those plagued by 
many 
years of war in the area. 


    Mr Nazir Carrim of the PWV legislature's education desk said 
support had been received from Dr Saths Cooper of the Family 
Institute, Lloyd Vogelman of Wits University and other experts. 
  For those between the ages of 13 and 18, a school 
re-orientation programme will begin next month and run until 
December with the idea of integrating them into normal schools 
at the beginning of next year. 
  In a frank admission, Duarte said it was true that some SDU 
members had been involved in criminal activities. She said the 
time for action, and not rhetoric, had come. She also said 
police had expressed a willingness to take people into their 
reservist force, but communities had to agree on who would be 
allowed in. Those who were involved in criminal activities 
would be left out. 
  Duarte also said they had consulted with industry on the 
East 
Rand about job creation. Most industries had expressed concern 
at the high level of violence and it was important for the area 
to achieve stability before investment in the area could be 
expected. 
  Housing MEC Mr Dan Mofokeng has identified a development 
plan 
in Germiston, she said. The project could create employment for 
some SDU members. 
  Duarte also announced that Housing Minister Mr Joe Slovo had 
approved PWV premier Mr Tokyo Sexwale's plan to build 150,000 
low-cost houses in the next 12 months.

  [Text] All political parties in the PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Provincial Legislature have 
indicated they will support the choice of Johannesburg as a 
provincial capital. The report in which a special committee 
recommends Johannesburg in preference to Pretoria or Midrand was 
tabled in the Legislature this afternoon. The Freedom Front 
said a condition for its support was that the ANC deal with the 
question of Afrikaner cultural freedom with great 
circumspection. The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] said it 
supported Johannesburg as a short-term choice, but that Midrand 
was more suitable in the long term. The Provincial Legislature 
is to discuss the question tomorrow.

<F P=106> [By Enid Rhodes] </F>
  [Text] Bloemfontein June 20 SAPA -- It would be the painful 
task of the Orange Free State [OFS] Provincial Legislature -- 
within the parameters of the law -- to put an end to the culture 
of anarchy, plunder and murder that began in the old order. Its 
task would be to stop the rotting process from affecting the 
healthy parts of Free State society and then to build on them 
into the future, OFS Premier Patrick Lekota said in his state of 
the nation address at the second sitting of the Provincial 
Legislature in Bloemfontein on Monday [20 June]. 
  Mr Lekota said that since the election there had been a 
pattern of events that suggested there were several conceptions 
of the meaning of freedom. These conceptions differed from that 
of the legislature and of that of the negotiators and authors of 
the interim Constitution and violated the provisions of that 
Constitution. It was a conception that could only be described 
as a "general free-for-all, dog-eat-dog and the devil gets the 
hindmost". 
  That was the only way to describe the wholesale plunder and 
theft of movable public property, the vandalism of immovable 
property, unauthorised occupancy of public buildings, the 
setting up of kangaroo courts in the jurisdiction of recognised 
traditional leaders, the extortion of monetary contributions to 
fake funeral funds by dubious characters masquerading as 
activists of well-known political parties/organisations and the 
commandeering of minibus taxis by groups of thieves, bent on 
selfish motives, said the premier. 
  Mr Lekota said there was deep concern with the wholesale 
occupation of property of individual farmers, property 
developers, church property and that of business. This 
destroyed black and white property owners alike. While 
sensitive to the plight of deprived communities, this approach 
could not be encouraged. It was a violation of rights enshrined 
in the Constitution. 
  He said that in QwaQwa there were people who had occupied 
public homes before the election. Proper rental had not been 
collected from the occupants because of the ineptitude of those 
who had composed the political leadership. This situation had 
been inherited by the new government, but it could not allow it 
to continue. Urgent steps had to be taken by the minister for 
local government to negotiate proper rental and ensure that it 
was paid. 
  A second category of illegal occupants of public property 
were those who took advantage of the uncertainty of transition 
after the election. People who were using public facilities for 
private gain had to vacate these facilities with immediate 
effect or the legislature would be compelled to act against them. 
  It would be a breach of faith and a crime against the people 
if members of the Legislature allowed friends or relatives undue 
access to public property or any other resources. 
  Mr Lekota said he was resolute that his administration 
should 
live up to the standards of public honesty and fairness that the 
people of the OFS deserved. If they "lacked the guts" to 
protect the property of the people against a few individuals 
then they deserved none of the trust placed in them. 
  The OFS administration would not fire anyone from employment 
without proper procedures of hearing. The principle of "audi 
alteram partem" [hear the other side] would guide its actions at 
all material times. But those who, after a proper hearing, were 
found unable to account for their actions could and must expect 
action against them. 
  Mr Lekota made this point in the light of the "nonchalant 
and 
lackadaisical manner" in which sections of the civil service had 
been reported to have approached their work since the election. 
Those who conceived of freedom as a condition of permanent 
holiday, endless drinking sprees, laxity of group and individual 
discipline, salary without service, sluggishness, general 
collapse of order and organisation had to "revisit their 
orientation". They were in the wrong place in the OFS. 
  The OFS intended to deliver on the promises made before the 
elections. This meant hard work and there was no room for the 
lazy or reluctant fellow-travellers. Everyone had to prove on a 
daily basis that they deserved their job. Otherwise the 
deserving unemployed should get a chance to prove themselves.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 21 June (AFP) -- A French military 
"assessment" team has arrived in Goma, in eastern Zaire near the 
Rwandan border, to prepare for a humanitarian mission in Rwanda, 
sources close to the operation said Tuesday [21 June]. The 
sources said that the group of about 15 French soldiers 
preparing for the Rwandan mission code-named "Operation 
Turquoise" were holding talks with ranking Zairian officials to 
decide how the French-led intervention force could transit via 
Zaire. 
  The report came as two Belgian newspapers said Tuesday that 
some French troops had already arrived in Rwanda from Zaire, 
without waiting for the green light from the UN Security 
Council. According to the LE SOIR newspaper, "the French have 
apparently already crossed the border and are at Cyangugu where 
the Kamembe runway has already been repaired, as the Kigali 
airport was judged to be unusable," LE SOIR said. Cyangugu lies 
in southwestern Rwanda, across the border from Zaire. The 
Flemish-language GAZET VAN ANTWERPEN also reported that French 
soldiers were already in Rwanda, quoting reliable sources, but 
did not say where they were or give their number. 
  A French draft resolution introduced in the UN Security 
Council on Monday said the French deployment, expected to 
involve 1,000 to 2,000 troops, would last until the UN mission 
in the central African state could muster reinforcements. It 
would end in mid-August at the latest.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] There's been a serious breakdown in discipline in 
the Djibouti Army, which has been fighting the FRUD [Front for 
the Restoration of Unity and Democracy] rebels in the north of 
the country. 
  The Army have had the upper hand for much of this year, but 
it seems a small group of veterans are not happy about the way 
they've been treated, and there has been a gun battle in the 
capital, Djibouti City, from where Christo Farah telexed this 
report: 
  Yesterday afternoon, an antiterrorist unit attacked a group 
of about 20 discontented soldiers who have been pressing the 
government to accept their financial demands. The incident took 
place in the neighborhood of Belbela on the outskirts of the 
capital. The interior minister, Idris Harbi Farah, said the 
mutiny has posed a threat to security, because they had refused 
to hand in their military uniforms and hand grenades. He said 
the clashes began when one of the discontented soldiers took the 
pin out of a grenade, while his colleagues got into combat 
positions, forcing the police to open fire. Five policemen were 
wounded in the fighting and unspecified number of mutineers were 
killed or wounded. Interior minister has described the 
rebellious soldiers as a handful of demobilized elements from 
the Army who have been manipulated by the opposition. The 
police are now looking for another group of about 30 soldiers 
who were also involved in the mutiny.

  [Excerpts] Abidjan, 20 Jun (AFP) -- The vast majority of 
students enrolled at the University of Abidjan turned up for 
classes today in spite of a new strike call by the Federation of 
University and High School Students of Cote d'Ivoire [FESCI], an 
officially banned organization. About 400 combat-ready 
gendarmes and policemen took up position in the very early hours 
of the day in front of lecture halls and tutorial blocks, AFP 
noted. No incident was reported by 1000. 
  Several leaders of the FESCI, which is composed of the most 
radical students, were present on the campus but they answered 
questions with great caution. "The land is mined," they 
explained, refusing to comment further on the situation. 
[passage omitted] 
  Six students entered the second week of their hunger strike 
today at the country's second university town, Bouake, which is 
290 km north of Abidjan. They were transferred to Bouake 
central hospital on 16 June from the Burkina Faso Consulate 
where they began their strike. "They are still refusing food 
but they do accept water," the hospital director told AFP. "For 
the time being, their lives are not in danger. We cannot 
forcibly feed them but should their condition worsen we will be 
compelled to intervene," he stated. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] After a break in the peace talks at the request of 
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], 
everything indicates that the negotiating teams will resume 
talks tomorrow. Over the weekend, Alioune Blondin Beye, special 
representative of the UN secretary general in Angola and 
mediator in the peace talks, was in Huambo and Luanda, where he 
held contacts at the highest level. He returned to Lusaka last 
evening. 
  The UNITA negotiating team returned this afternoon from 
Huambo, where it held talks with its leader, Jonas Savimbi, and 
its leadership. The government negotiating team, which used the 
break to go to Luanda, also returned to Lusaka early this 
evening. All the people involved in the peace talks are here in 
Lusaka, but it is still not known what the negotiating teams 
will discuss tomorrow. 
  Before the peace talks were interrupted, the negotiating 
teams from the government and UNITA were discussing the 
involvement of UNITA and its senior leaders in the government. 
  Meanwhile, on the occasion of Africa Refugee Day today, 
Angolan refugees here in Zambia called on the government and 
UNITA to speed up the present talks with a view to establishing 
peace in Angola, because they are tired of living as refugees. 
There are 50,000 Angolan refugees in Zambia.

  [Text] Addis Ababa, 21 Jun (AFP) -- The Organisation of 
African Unity (OAU) on Tuesday [21 June] warned of the "dangers" 
of a French military intervention in Rwanda and called instead 
for more African UN troops. The pan-African body supported the 
principle of a French proposal to send troops to Rwanda to 
staunch a 10-week bloodbath, but said that African UN 
peacekeepers would be better because Rwandan rebels opposed the 
French plan. 
  "While the OAU fully understands and appreciates the concern 
of the international community, including France, over the 
carnage that continues to be perpetrated in Rwanda, it is at the 
same time concerned that given the expressed opposition by one 
of the parties to the conflict, there are fears of possible 
complications and indeed dangers of such an action," the 
organisation said in a statement. 
  It said a number of African countries were willing to send 
4,000 troops to reinforce the 495 UN peacekeepers in Rwanda and 
blamed rich nations for failing "to provide the required 
logistical and financial support to enable the troops to be 
quickly deployed in Rwanda." "Any and all actions by an 
individual country or group of countries should consequently be 
undertaken within the scope of that international consensus, and 
of the framework of the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR 
II)," the statement said. "Given Africa's expressed commitment 
to support the efforts of the world body (UN), it is the view of 
the OAU that the best way was to ensure the deployment of these 
(4,000 African) troops under UNAMIR II," the statement said.

<F P=106> [Interview with OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmad Salim by </F>
Werner Bloch; place and date not given: "You in Europe Are Not 
Perfect Either!"] 
  [Text] [Bloch] The representatives in the OAU are national 
governments and not peoples. What specifically can you do if 
some governments are not representing the interests of all their 
ethnic groups? 
  [Salim] The African states are largely the product of the 
arbitrary drawing of borders by the colonial powers. 
Nevertheless, we have decided to retain the territorial 
integrity of our states. Regarding the representative nature of 
the governments, there are a few peculiarities. There has been 
democratization, which is certainly worth being recognized -- in 
Benin, Zambia, the Congo, to name just a few. In Africa, 
democratization means two things: first, that power emanates 
from the people, and second, that we have good, reliable 
governments. I do not know which system is most suitable for 
that. 
  Regarding the problem of tribalism, it has turned out that 
Europe is not free from it either -- the term "ethnic cleansing" 
was invented in Europe. I say this without polemics. It is 
little consolidation if one looks at poverty, misery, and 
violence as they are now in Rwanda -- conditions that shock and 
sicken me -- and then says: You in Europe are not perfect 
either. But no one in the world can claim a monopoly on 
everything good and pleasant. 
  As an international community, we must learn to learn from 
each other -- from the tragedies in Bosnia just as from the 
tragedies in Africa. In particular, we must also solve the 
ethnic and religious conflicts, because otherwise they develop 
such an explosive power that they become nightmares for our 
society. 
  [Bloch] You have repeatedly stressed how important economic 
cooperation among the African states is -- the creation of a 
united economic area. How is this supposed to work among 
countries that are all struggling for survival, since even the 
attempt at cooperation among highly developed industrial states 
in Europe is difficult? 
  [Salim] Quite right, but I would look at it precisely the 
other way round: If the need for cooperation among the 
prosperous former colonial powers is undisputed, how much more 
urgent is this need than for Africa! Precisely because of the 
brittleness of our society and the widespread power, we must 
cooperate all the more closely and effectively. In April, the 
35th member country ratified the agreement on an African 
economic community. It is part of our postcolonial syndrome of 
dependence that we talk much about economic cooperation but have 
done little for it. We have always looked toward the north. We 
need experts -- we look toward the north; we want to buy things 
-- we look toward the north. Even today it is sometimes easier 
to fly from one African country to another via Europe. Or one 
makes telephone calls via Europe -- all these are things that 
must change. 
  [Bloch] How? 
  [Salim] The African countries must finally be able to 
improve 
their foreign trade balance. We have always been told: You 
must simply work harder and produce more. But today everyone 
knows that this does not work. The Africans -- in particular in 
the rural areas -- can work two, three, or four times harder and 
would still get less for it than 10 years ago. The unjust 
imbalance of the international market must make the West think. 
  No one denies that Africa has enormous resources -- 
minerals, 
raw materials, the gigantic hydroelectric volume of our waters. 
People always talk about Africa as the continent of the future. 
I am more interested in Africa as the continent of the present. 
The point is to use our resources in a sensible way. 
  [Bloch] In the German media, Africa is never portrayed as 
the 
continent of the future, not even as the continent of the 
present.... 
  [Salim, interrupting] ...Because there is an English 
proverb: 
"You give a dog a bad name and you hang it." As long as Africa 
is portrayed only as a confused, miserable, vegetating 
continent, whose rulers are entangled in bloody wars with each 
other and cut each other's throats after military coups, 
naturally no one will care for our concerns. However, if one 
explained the efforts of the normal Africans for economic 
improvements and political reforms to the Germans, they would be 
more understanding. 
  [Bloch] What are you relations like with those ruling in 
Europe? Do you not often appear as a suppliant? 
  [Salim] When I go to Europe or the United States or to the 
Gulf states, I never turn up holding out my hand in 
supplication. Rather, I am making propaganda for actively 
understanding our problems. The best support develops if the 
people understand what is going on on our continent beyond all 
cliches. 
  [Bloch] And does such understanding exist? 
  [Salim] There is a lot of double standard and hypocrisy. 
Today some people talk about "Afro-pessimism" and reproach 
Africa for precisely those things for which they are partly to 
blame themselves and which they have partly brought about. Some 
people speak of corrupt, dictatorial regimes -- governments with 
which they have cooperated for decades and with whose help they 
are acquiring advantages. In addition, the Europeans must 
understand that Africa can never be understood as a homogeneous 
mass. This would be as if one were to declare Bosnia a 
typically European phenomenon.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Up to now, the OAU secretary 
general has not said anything. However this is the right time 
to speak out. They should talk so that everyone's position is 
clear. It is clear that some OAU member countries still behave 
like colonized people instead of searching for the truth. These 
are for example countries which agreed to send their troops in 
the campaign to be led by France. The Rwandan Patriotic Front 
[RPF] representatives in Brussels gave them the right message: 
Please find other ways to repay the French debt, not with 
Rwandan blood. 
  The OAU agreed to sit with the leader of the killers, 
Theodore Sindikubwabo, the interim president of Rwanda. This 
has been said and forgotten but the OAU should not add one evil 
to another. The OAU should choose the right path and openly 
denounce the French aggression, because the consequences will be 
many. [passage omitted].

  [Excerpts] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] categorically 
rejects and strongly opposes French military intervention 
throughout Rwandan territory. [passage omitted] 
  In addition to the RPF, numerous countries, notably those in 
the Great Lakes region, have also made public their opposition 
to French military intervention in Rwanda. We have spoken, for 
example, of the reaction of Tanzanian Prime Minister John 
Malecela, who condemned the French intervention in Rwanda, 
because the OAU and United Nations are dealing genuinely with 
the Rwandan issue. [passage omitted] 
  The situation is similar in Zaire. The opposition there 
condemned French military intervention in Rwanda, and asked the 
Zairean Government not to back the French, notably by giving 
them a military base. Another neighboring country is Uganda: 
President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, who is on a visit to the 
United States, has stated that French military intervention in 
Rwanda will be a disaster, as it is opposed by the RPF. 
  It is worth recalling at this juncture that the RPF has made 
this clear, by warning the international community and those 
countries who ally themselves with France. This French 
intervention risks going beyond Rwanda's borders, and might even 
set the whole region ablaze. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Jacques Bihozagara, RPF political bureau </F>
member, by correspondent Quentin Dickinson in Brussels; date not 
given--recorded] 
  [Text] Our interview this evening is with Jacques 
Bihozagara, member of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] 
political bureau and deputy prime minister of the government 
according to the Arusha agreement. Mr. Bihozagara was expected 
in Paris this morning for talks with French officials, but in 
the end he declined the invitation. Quentin Dickinson met him 
in Brussels. He asked him first of all about his feelings, his 
assessment of the statement issued by the OAU this evening 
opposing French humanitarian intervention in Rwanda. Listen to 
Jacques Bihozagara: 
  [Bihozagara] We believe that the OAU, as an international 
institution which was closely involved with the Arusha talks, 
which ended in the signing of the Arusha peace agreement, has 
reacted properly in speaking out against French intervention, 
which in fact goes against the Arusha agreement, and also the UN 
resolution. 
  [Dickinson] Does this decision by the OAU come as a surprise 
to you? 
  [Bihozagara] Listen, it is not surprising, and we believe 
that the OAU has always defended the Arusha agreement against 
those who in fact wanted to (?upset things). 
  [Dickinson] You were due to go to Paris to meet the 
cooperation minister, Michel Roussin, and Madame Michaux-Chevry: 
Why did you not go? 
  [Bihozagara] I believe that this is a misleading report, 
because in fact France was ready to receive me in Paris, but it 
was not a meeting with the people whom you have just mentioned, 
so that is why I did not go. 
  [Dickinson] So, who you were due to see? 
  [Bihozagara] Listen, you know that the Rwandan problem at 
present requires in-depth analysis by political decision-makers 
and I believe that if one has to go to Paris one has to see the 
people who have the Rwandan question among their areas of 
responsibility. 
  [Dickinson] The Rwandan question is part of the cooperation 
minister's brief, though. 
  [Bihozagara] However, the cooperation minister was not 
mentioned as being one of the people that I was due to meet. 
  [Dickinson] You would have met him though, if you were 
invited. 
  [Bihozagara] As far as I know we have always met the French 
authorities -- even last year, when I was the RPF's official in 
Europe with responsibility for foreign policy -- so there is no 
reason why we do not meet the French authorities if this can 
bring about understanding. 
  [Dickinson] You know that the European public are quite 
shocked by the massacres in your country, so how do you answer 
the people here who say we have the impression that for you 
putting an end to the massacres is, in a way, a secondary matter 
compared with the military victory which you are expecting? 
  [Bihozagara] We believe that the RPF was the party most 
greatly concerned about stopping the massacres, and the RPF went 
into action on 7 April after the death of President Habyarimana 
when all the international communities had pulled out of Rwanda 
[as heard], so I believe that if there are people who are 
changing their opinion now it is not because of this 
international community or France, but it is due to the 
intervention of the RPF, which has been able to save various 
people without distinction from the assault by the militias and 
extremists of the Rwandan army. 
  [Dickinson] Do you not think that by the same token French 
intervention or international intervention would make it 
possible to save lives? 
  [Bihozagara] I believe we have spoken out in favor of 
international intervention, but we do not welcome French 
intervention, for the reasons which we have outlined, because 
France has been too heavily involved in Rwanda's affairs.

  [Text] Kigali, June 21 (AFP) -- UN military observers from 
Senegal, Congo and Togo will leave Kigali Wednesday [22 June] 
after receiving threats from Rwandan rebels over France's 
planned military intervention, UN sources said Tuesday. 
  More than 40 out of a total of 124 observers in Rwanda will 
quit the capital city, the sources said. The overall UN mission 
in Rwanda comprises 495 personnel. 
  French-speaking Senegal, Congo and Togo are seen as 
supporting Paris' plan to send 2,000 troops to Rwanda to halt 
ethnic slaughter raging since early April. 
  UN military observers said Rwandan rebels fiercely opposed 
to 
the French intervention plan have agreed to escort the African 
observers to the Ugandan border. 
  The rebels, mainly Tutsis, are wary of France because of its 
past support of President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu whose 
death in an April 6 plane crash touched off the violence.

  [Excerpts] Violence is still prevailing in Rwanda. [passage 
omitted] 
  As for the Rwandan interim government, which was set up at 
the beginning of the wave of violence in Rwanda, it has just 
taken sides. As was expected, this government has expressed 
support for the French initiative through the Rwandan ambassador 
in Brussels. However, Rwandan Ambassador Francois 
Ngarukiyintwali, first clearly denied that there were French

  [Begin Ngarukiyintwali recording] First, I would like to 
recall the allegations made by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] 
about the alleged presence of French troops in Rwanda. The 
Rwandan Government supports the initiative of the French 
Government in launching humanitarian intervention on the ground 
in Rwanda, with a view to protecting and rescuing people who are 
in a dangerous situation. The Rwandan Government believes that 
this humanitarian and [word indistinct] action should cover both 
the zone controlled by the government and that occupied by the 
RPF. [end recording]

  [Text] The new Zairian prime minister has already disclosed 
his intentions even before the formation of his government. 
Kengo Wa Dondo this morning announced the suspension of all 
payments by the state treasury. 
  Meanwhile, the radical opposition continues to criticize the 
new prime minister. Close supporters of Etienne Tshisekedi, 
grouped under the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition, say 
that Kengo Wa Dondo's election was unconstitutional. This is 
what Lambert Mende, communications minister in the Tshisekedi 
government had to say on this issue: 
  [Begin Mende recording] The election of a prime minister to 
head this government is tainted with illegality and 
unconstitutionality. This is the first decision we have arrived 
at. We have also decided, regarding the systematic violation of 
our Constitution by President Mobutu and by some members of the 
bureau of the High Council of the Republic, to intensify popular 
resistance in accordance with Articles 16 and 37 of the 
Constitutional Transitional Act. We have thus decided to 
organize in the next few days a great march of liberation of our 
country throughout all the regions of the Republic of Zaire. We 
have also resolved to intensify the boycott of French economic 
interests in Zaire, as well as the economic interests of members 
of President Mobutu's political class and their allies. [end

<F P=106> [Interview with President Isaias Afwerki by Salih 'Abdallah </F>
in Asmara "last week"] 
  [Excerpts] ['Abdallah] A year after you officially assumed 
power in Eritrea, how do you assess your experience in the light 
of current Eritrean conditions? 
  [Isaias] We are now at the stage of rebuilding what was 
destroyed by war and establishing a future political system to 
run the country. I can say that the setting up of a commission 
for the Eritrean Constitution is an important political 
achievement. It certainly needs to exert tremendous efforts, 
with participation by the people, to draft a constitution. By 
cooperating with states with resources and with UN agencies, we 
are now working on creating government agencies. I can say we 
overcame real difficulties. 
  On the other hand, there are certain problems inherited from 
the liberation war. These are economic and social problems. 
We are trying our best to overcome them by introducing 
practical programs. Because the challenges were great, we can 
say that certain successes have been achieved in certain fields. 
  ['Abdallah] In your speech last year, you set a transitional 
period for your government and said that free, multi-party 
elections will be held. Will you keep to your promise to allow 
free elections? 
  [Isaias] Free elections will be held on the basis of the 
Constitution. The Constitution will determine the political 
system and the form of government in Eritrea. The setting up of 
a commission for the Constitution, is, in my opinion, a first 
step in that direction. Within two years, and with the 
participation of the Eritrean people, this commission will draft 
the Constitution. Within three years after the Constitution is 
ratified, elections will be held according to the approved 
Constitution. This is not only a promise or a commitment, but 
is an imperative thing to do to support the stability that 
prevails in Eritrea right now. I think this is also a historic 
need, not just an act of charity or the decision of a political 
party or government that is in power now, during this 
transitional phase. 
  ['Abdallah] The transitional National Council has an 
overwhelming majority from the Popular Front for Democracy and 
Justice; you are its secretary general. Does this mean you plan 
to tailor an Eritrean constitution to the front's standards? 
  [Isaias] The new structure of the council is considered a 
progressive step. Half the members are not from the Popular 
Front. This means other members are represented in it, unlike 
the first council which indeed had the majority of members from 
the Popular Front. The composition of the current National 
Council is comprehensive at this stage. I think the front's 
role in, and contribution to the government agencies is reducing 
now. On the other hand, government work is now completely 
separated in principle and we are seriously seeking to apply 
this in practice. The front and the government are two separate 
things, and they have different issues to address. The Popular 
Front understands its role in this society and is playing this 
role wisely and carefully. It also gives the opportunity for 
more participation by the people in this country. 
  ['Abdallah] When you talk about participation, do you mean 
the other Eritrean factions? If so, which ones do you mean? If 
that is not the case, then what is the future of the other 
Eritrean military and political organizations? 
  [Isaias] In the march of this country, we are not interested 
in talking about other Eritrean political trends that are linked 
to Arab or foreign regimes. We do not think other countries 
have the right to participate with us in drafting the 
constitution or the political system in Eritrea in any way. Nor 
do we like to interfere in the political affairs of others. 
There is no justification for any state or certain political 
forces to impose on us groups and factions and to appoint 
themselves custodians over our future and bring us a political 
system that suits their own whims. 
  We do not think there are Eritrean political forces outside 
the Eritrean arena. The entire Eritrean people are 
participating in the national action during the transitional 
period, in an atmosphere marked by tranquillity and in which 
there is no suppression or attempts to impose a certain view. 
  The process to draft the Constitution is continuing. Through 
it we will confirm broad-based popular participation. But if 
certain states wish to impose a specific group on us and talk 
about cultural and political differences and a host of past 
disputes, then we are trying to avoid that and not accept what 
they are trying to impose on us from abroad. We are also trying 
not to enter into bargains with certain states or political 
forces so that they give us aid in return for allowing them to 
impose on us certain political forces that will in the end turn 
into a fifth column working inside this country. We say this is 
unacceptable. What is going on the Eritrean arena in terms of 
participation and the steps to establish a democratic system is 
a firm course. It will not be affected by false conjecture: Is 
there participation or not; is there democracy or not. This 
must be made clear to certain people abroad who think that by 
talking about democracy and participation, they can impose a 
group of people or individuals on Eritrean politics. [passage 
omitted] 
  ['Abdallah] Mr. President, many questions have been raised 
about Eritrea's identity. The fact that Eritrea has not yet 
joined the Arab League raises fears among the Arabs that Eritrea 
is distancing itself from its Arab surrounding. What do you 
think, your excellency? 
  [Isaias] We are Africans above anything else. We exist in 
this continent and our geographic position is part of our 
identity. We cannot deny this identity. There is no dualism in 
identity. And, before that, there is one identity; that is, we 
are all Eritreans. [passage omitted] 
  ['Abdallah] There are reports of Sudanese military 
reinforcements on the borders with Eritrea following the Abu 
Jabal [placename as published] incident in which the Eritrean 
forces arrested a Sudanese officer and then the Qarmakiya 
[placename as published] incident in which a camp of the 
Eritrean forces was destroyed. Does this mean there will be a 
potential for tension in the entire region? 
  [Isaias] First, I do not have specific information. However, 
what I would like to say is that we had differences with the 
regime in Sudan over certain issues. I think these are pushing 
in the direction of tension and disagreement with Sudan, but a 
conflict would be too far from the reality. What happened was 
very simple. The border police conducted an operation to fight 
smuggling. There was a shootout, by accident. The incident did 
not have any political nature. This I can say. I can also 
confirm that it was not a political clash, but an incident that 
can happen anywhere. Regardless of how many differences we may 
have with Sudan, I do not think that such differences can reach 
the point of an armed conflict. What are the reasons and the 
motives? If some people tried to interpret this incident as a 
sign of a potential war between Eritrea and Sudan, I can say 
that this is very far from our thinking and strategy. The 
entire subject has been resolved. Such issues are resolved 
through a joint effort by both countries. 
  ['Abdallah] Stories have arisen recently over 
Eritrean-Israeli relations. This issue has been a subject of 
concern. A report by one of the regional organizations that 
monitor Israeli activity in Africa says Israeli promised to set 
up three Israeli military bases in Asmara, Dankalia, and Sakhit 
[last two placenames as published]. What is the true Eritrean 
position on this? 
  [Isaias] All this is a propaganda and media clamor. We 
should not be asked to be in a certain track more than others. 
If some people are trying to find an excuse for their 
psychological complexes by directing the finger of accusation 
toward Eritrea over its cooperation and relations with Israel, 
then I can say that this will not serve that purpose. Even the 
psychological problems and the domestic political problems 
cannot be justified by directing false accusations against 
Eritrea or fabricating scenarios to frighten people in order to 
justifiy certain trends. What will follow such an announcement? 
Who wants to promote the idea that Eritrea is going to give 
Israel bases here and there? What is the purpose? 
Sensationalism? But what will follow? I believe that there 
are certain people who are living in an illusion and excel at 
hypocrisy, instead of dealing with reality in a rational way. 
What they claim may have been possible 15 or 20 years ago. But 
things are different now. The Palestinians have reached an 
agreement with Israel, and those who used to accuse the 
Americans of conspiracies in the past are now extending their 
hands asking for help from the United States to resolve this 
problem. Several events have proved that the rational and 
practical thing to do is to act in a constructive way. I think 
that, regardless of its source, this sensationalism has been 
outdated and there is no need for such a clamor.

  [Excerpt] The Kenya Government yesterday dismissed as 
"trash" reports by the British press that up to 10,000 people 
have been killed in the Turkana region of Kenya by raiding 
parties from the Toposa and Pokot tribes. 
  A report by the DAILY TELEGRAPH says that the future for the 
Turkana people is under threat from the raids and that the 
Turkana have been forced to flee into the central deserts "where 
their cattle die of starvation, leaving the fugitives with no 
choice but to turn to the government for relief". 
  However, when the permanent secretary in charge of internal 
security, Mr. Wilfred Kimalat, was contacted for comment, he 
said: "Why write such trash? There is nothing like that." 
  Quoting correspondent George Monbiot, the DAILY TELEGRAPH 
said: "in the north, the Sudanese Government has armed the 
Toposa tribe with submachine guns and rocket launchers, hoping 
they will fight the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA)." 
  And, in the south, writes Mr. Monbiot: "The Kenya Government 
has supplied automatic rifles to the Pokot people, to cleanse 
their lands of tribes opposed to the administration." [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Tanzania has appealed to the international community 
for assistance in the field of medicine, to be able to cope with 
the problems caused by the influx of Rwandese refugees in the 
Kagera region. The appeal was made in Dar es Salaam by the 
prime minister and first vice president, the Honorable John 
Malecela, who said an outbreak of diarrhoea has been reported in 
Kagera region. The Honorable Malecela made the appeal during 
talks in his office in Dar es Salaam with the representative of 
the World Health Organization to Tanzania and Seychelles, Dr. 
(B. Woring), who paid him a courtesy call. The prime minister 
also appealed for help in enhancing Tanzania's ability to 
provide health centers with essential drug kits. Denmark is 
assisting Tanzania in its essential drugs program and the prime 
minister said it was Tanzania's hope that other donors would do 
the same.

  [Text] Lagos, June 21 (AFP) -- The main Nigerian opposition 
group Tuesday [21 June] ruled out using military means to 
restore democracy to Nigeria, just over a year after the 
military annulled presidential elections here. 
  "We have no intentions whatsoever to seek the interaction or 
assistance of military action in our patriotic pursuit", the 
National Democratic Coalition said. 
  The recently-formed coalition, comprising politicians, 
former 
ministers, ex-state military governors and retired military 
officers, has called on the military ruler General Sani Abacha 
to hand over power to Yoruba politician Moshood Abiola. 
  Abiola was the widely accepted winner of the presidential 
elections, organised last June. The then military ruler Ibrahim 
Babangida banned the publication of the results. 
  The current military ruler, Abacha, took over in November. 
  The pro-democracy coalition has supported Abiola who earlier 
this month proclaimed himself head of a parallel government 
after breaking out of house arrest and going into hiding.

  [Text] The head of state, General Sani Abacha, today 
continues consultations on his administration's political 
program with the meeting with leaders of thought in the country. 
From Abuja, State House correspondent Ojie Ogbonaya Ojie 
reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Ojie] Declaring the meeting open, Gen. 
Abacha said it was part of his administration's consultation 
with various interest groups and certain segments of society on 
the state of the nation. 
  [Abacha] As you are aware of, many thought that the events 
of 
the past two weeks were going to impact so adversely on our 
peaceful progress towards the democratic transition. In any way 
they were right, in that some attempts were indeed made to 
derail progress in the process, and bring the nation back to the 
[words indistinct] from which we pulled it on 13th November last 
year. The (?vigilance) and firm measures taken by security and 
law enforcement agencies, and the refusal of our citizenry to be 
made the cannon fodder for the fulfillment of the individual 
personal ambitions, have combined to foil the plans of those who 
wish to disrupt our national peace and harmony. 
  [Ojie] Gen. Abacha said it was ironical for all and sundry 
to 
hold the military responsible for everything in the society. He 
said as much, as it was not his intention to respond to the 
charges and counter accusations being leveled against the 
military and the process of governance in the country. It was 
on record, he added, that some of the critics were those who 
invited his administration to power. 
  [Abacha] The truth of the matter is that some of you here 
present today, and many who are now pretending otherwise, 
appealed to us to intervene and arrest the drifting of the 
(?dark day). Even the representatives of some foreign 
governments made [words indistinct] appeals to us to save the 
nation from imminent collapse and disintegration. We have 
responded patriotically and in consonance with our professional 
calling. We believe that we have achieved the first major 
objective of our intervention, that of maintaining the corporate 
existence of our country as one and indivisible nation, and 
creating the atmosphere of peace and security in which our 
people can pursue their legitimate businesses without fear of 
what tomorrow may bring. 
  [Ojie] Gen. Abacha emphasized the importance of (?private) 
participation in the constitutional conference, and reaffirmed 
the commitment and determination of his administration to the 
restoration of democracy in the country within the shortest 
possible time. 
  [Abacha] We are now concentrating on (?certain) major 
objectives of our intervention -- the restoration of democracy 
in our beloved country. Let none confuse issues or mislead our 
foreign friends and well-wishers by bringing the (?impression) 
of the nation in disharmony as far as commitment to democracy is 
concerned. Civilians or military, politicians or other 
professionals, we are all as a people yearning for democracy. 
We are all yearning for the rule of law, a free press, and 
fundamental human rights. The (?labor) for democracy is 
nobody's monopoly. It is the wealth of the nation. 
  [Ojie] On the economy, the head of state said that the 
government was prepared to monitor and review the economic 
policies and adopt corrective measures where necessary. He 
blamed the problems facing the implementation of economic 
policies on greed and exploitation by some businessmen. Gen. 
Abacha then gave the assurance that the welfare of the people 
will henceforth remain the main focus of the economic policies 
of his administration. Top prominent leaders were drawn from 
each state of the Federation. Some of them include the former 
vice president, Dr. Alex Ekwueme. [end recording]

  [Text] Three persons -- Chief Segun Osoba, Mr. Jonah David 
Jang, and retired Air Commodore Dan Suleiman -- yesterday 
appeared before the Federal High Court [FHC] in Lagos on charges 
of treason. The chief judge of the FHC, Mr. Justice Mohamed 
Belgore, who was presiding over the case, directed that the men, 
who are on bail should not be rearrested. 
  The defense had complained that the accused persons were 
being harassed by the police and security agents. Mr. Justice 
Belgore ruled that the police or security agents should not 
interrogate, visit, or invite any of the three accused persons 
without specific order from the court, pending the determination 
of the case. He also directed that the bail of the accused 
persons should continue under the present condition till 
tomorrow when hearing of the case would continue. 
  Also, yesterday, Mr. Justice Belgore granted bail to a 
Lagos- 
based medical practitioner, Dr. Beko Ransome-Kuti, standing 
trial for treasonable felony. Dr. Ransome-Kuti was however 
asked to sign an undertaking not to commit the same offense he 
was charged with in the [words indistinct] bail. He was banned 
from addressing any gathering, issuing press statements, or 
participating in any public gathering, and he must remain within 
his locality. In addition, he will produce two sureties and pay 
a sum of 10,000 naira which would be forfeited in the event of 
nonfulfillment of the conditions. Mr. Justice Belgore stressed 
that any breach of the conditions would invalidate the bail.

  [Text] The body of a former Armed Forces Ruling Council 
member, Vice Admiral Babatunde Elegbede, is being buried about 
now in Lagos. He was killed last Sunday [19 June] by a gang of 
attackers in Oworonshoki area of Lagos. The late Vice Adm. 
Elegbede entered the Nigeria Defense Academy in 1962, after 
which he attended military and civil training institutions both 
at home and abroad. He held various command appointments in the 
Nigerian Navy. At the time of his retirement last December, 
Adm. Elegbede was chief of administration at the Defense 
Headquarters. The late naval chief is survived by three wives 
and eight children. His death at the hands of the gang of 
attackers is being investigated by the police. 
  Reports say that the gang had trailed Adm. Elegbede to a 
point where his vehicle was forced to stop, and the attackers 
then opened fire on him. About three weeks ago Adm. Elegbede 
was conferred with a chieftaincy title by the Oba of Lagos.

  [Text] The Transkei Defense Force has denied that SANDF 
[South African National Defense Force] soldiers have taken over 
control of military bases in the Transkei. However, SANDF 
soldiers were deployed at bases at the Transkei's request to 
quell the mutiny. This follows rioting last week when soldiers 
in Port St. Johns and Umtata protested against low salaries and 
held a senior officer hostage. The officer commanding the SANDF 
in the Transkei, Major General Themba Matanzima, said 195 
Transkei Defense Force members were being held in connection 
with the mutiny.

  [Text] Johannesburg June 21 SAPA -- President Nelson 
Mandela appeared on a Johannesburg street on Tuesday [21 June] 
to calm 500 angry aspirant soldiers turned away from an armed 
forces induction camp. Addressing the crowd outside the African 
National Congress headquarters in Plein St, Mr Mandela said he 
would not accept them acting like gangsters. He said he had 
heard that bread had been stolen from a nearby bakery, and that 
a police vehicle had been damaged. Mr Mandela said he did not 
want an army of criminals, but a disciplined force. 
  The would-be army recruits camped outside the ANC 
headquarters on Monday and vowed to stay there until the ANC 
agreed to talk to them. They said they had been turned away from 
the SA [South African] National Defence Force [SANDF] assembly 
point at Wallmannstahl, near Pretoria, after being told they 
were not on the ANC list of recruits. 
  They told SAPA: "We registered. Now suddenly we are no 
longer registered. Some of us left school and our jobs to join 
the army. What are we supposed to do now? We have no money for 
food or accommodation." 
  Bags, luggage and personal belongings were strewn around the 
entrance to the ANC head office. 
  "We have been here since 4AM, and some have been sleeping 
out 
here for the past two weeks, living on handouts." 
  A woman said some of them were Umkhonto We Sizwe (MK) [Spear 
of the Nation, ANC armed wing] members, while others had left 
work or school. "We are not going anywhere until the ANC speaks 
to us. We want to be part of the SANDF," she said. 
  "We can't go back to school or tech because registration is 
over. We left our schools and now we are just dumped," said a 
young man. 
  MK Commissar Andrew Masondo said on Monday the crowd was 
being "impatient". He said MK had submitted a list of its 
members to be retrained at Wallmannstahl for integration into 
the SANDF, which had to be thoroughly checked. 
  When it was pointed out to Mr Masondo that many of the crowd 
were not MK members and had left school or jobs to join the 
army, he said: "The list is for MK members. If the others just 
want to join the army, they should apply like everyone else 
does. You don't have to join the army via MK." 
  Officers said that of the 6,200 people who originally 
reported to Wallmannstahl, nearly 3,000 had been turned away 
because they were not on the ANC's list. 
  On Tuesday, Mr Mandela appeared and urged the crowd to 
follow 
proper induction procedures and to approach regional ANC 
structures for inclusion in the armed forces. 
  More exiled soldiers are expected to arrive in South Africa 
this week.

  [Text] Cape Town June 21 SAPA -- Secret cabinet and 
government decisions came under attack from African National 
Congress members of Parliament on Monday [20 June] who demanded 
a role for themselves in major decisions. 
  In an attempt to accommodate their demands and defuse a 
potential backbencher revolt, the ANC set up a committee to 
re-examine the relationship between the government, the cabinet 
and the ANC. The decision was taken at an ANC caucus meeting 
ahead of a two-week sitting of Parliament called to introduce 
the government of national unity's first budget. 
  A source close to the caucus said MPs had complained about 
being left out of key planning -- the siting of a new 
legislative capital for one. 
  ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa will head the 
committee. Other members are Trade and Industry Minister Trevor 
Manuel, Posts, Telecommunications and Broadcasting Minister 
Pallo Jordan and MP Raymond Suttner. The committee will examine 
the relationship between Parliament and the cabinet, especially 
the practice of cabinet taking decisions and expecting MPs to 
fall in with the decision. 
  Among the proposals was one that ordinary MPs be allowed to 
initiate their own legislation, and that MPs be allowed to vote 
how they wanted on issues, rather than having to toe the party 
line. There was also a proposal that standing committees 
reviewing legislation be open to the general public, not just 
the media. 
  The committee would draw up a discussion document, the 
source 
said. 
  An early issue that had some MPs up in arms was the question 
of a new legislative capital. MPs complained that a cabinet 
committee examining the issue appeared to have made up its mind 
without consulting them. 
  The caucus resolved to demand that the four-person committee 
be expanded to take in MP's views. The source said the 
committee should start its work from scratch. 
  On the introduction of constituencies to be represented by 
MPs, the caucus decided the issue had to be looked at in 
conjunction with the role of provincial legislators representing 
specific provinces. 
  Mr Ramaphosa is expected to outline some of the points 
raised 
by the caucus at a media conference later this week in which he 
is expected to deal with the restructuring of the ANC now that 
it is in government.

  [Text] Johannesburg June 21 SAPA -- PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Premier Tokyo Sexwale on Tuesday [21 
June] warned of people turning away from the African National 
Congress government if premiers were not given their powers 
soon. Speaking after a PWV Provincial Legislature sitting at 
Nasrec [National Exhibition Center] near Soweto he said people 
were expecting him to tackle issues such as housing, health and 
education for which he needed powers stipulated in terms of the 
constitution. 
  He and his 10 MECs [members of the Executive Committee] have 
been given powers equivalent to that of the Transvaal Provincial 
Administration Executive Committee, but many other powers had 
yet to be conferred. 
  Mr Sexwale said people would seek another government if no 
progress was made because he had no power to act. Mr Sexwale 
hoped an announcement on the remaining powers would be made soon.

  [Text] The political logjam over KwaZulu/Natal's capital 
has been broken at a marathon session of the province's cabinet 
in Pietermaritzburg. The issue: Should Ulundi be the capital 
or should it be Pietermaritzburg? The cabinet has agreed to 
hold a referendum on the question within 18 months and to set up 
a special commission to determine which city should be the 
interim capital. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Fawzia Moodley] Today's 
agreement comes in the wake of a major public row between the 
IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], which favors Ulundi, and the ANC, 
which wants Pietermaritzburg as the capital. There appears to 
have been some tough talking during the seven-hour session, but 
KwaZulu/Natal's interests seem to have won in the end. This was 
underlined by an agreement to alternate legislative assembly 
meetings between Pietermaritzburg and Ulundi, while the special 
commission's report is pending. 
  [KwaZulu/Natal Premier Frank Mdlalose] The referendum will 
be 
the one to decide where the capital is going to be. Now for the 
sake of having a referendum naturally we must have a voters' 
roll, which will indicate who are the residents of KwaZulu/Natal. 
  [Moodley] ANC provincial leader Jacob Zuma said a referendum 
was the way forward. 
  [Zuma] The discussions with our colleagues today have made 
all of us to agree to the way forward that we have agreed. 
  [Moodley] The agreement should ease tensions, which reached 
dangerous levels after both IFP leader and Home Affairs Minister 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and ANC MP Peter Mokaba entered the debate 
recently. The first sitting of the provincial legislature due 
to have been held in Ulundi next week has been postponed to late 
July or early August. Dr. Mdlalose said bills which were to 
have been debated hadn't yet been drafted. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Proposal for Truth Commission Backed -- The Johannesburg THE 
STAR in English on 21 June in a page-14 editorial responds to 
the police commissioner's report to Security Minister Mufamadi 
that if a "truth commission" is established it could "seriously 
embarrass the Government and hurt leading members of the ANC, 
including Cabinet ministers." "Since when is embarrassment 
cause to shrink from justice? Since when are people above 
justice simply because they hold high positions?" "What cannot 
be tolerated is that these criminals simply confess in secret 
and are then granted indemnity." Grasping the full significance 
of the effects of a "truth commission", the THE STAR states that 
"embarrassing is hardly the word for the effect of a truth 
commission: it could wreck the reputation and careers of many; 
it will be painful for all; and it will be a searing experience 
for families of the victims. But if this is the only way the 
truth will emerge, then so be it." 
  Winnie Mandela-Falati Controversy -- "Courts are there not 
only to uphold the law, but also to create precedents that will 
best serve the interests of society," begins THE STAR on 22 June 
in a page-18 editorial that comments on the recent overturning 
of a gag order on Xoliswa Falati who has sought to criticize 
Winnie Mandela's past behavior. "In this respect the judge in 
the Falati-Mandela case has done South Africa a service." "This 
is undoubtedly a landmark decision. In a society subjected to 
autocratic abuse for decades, the ground rules need to be 
clearly redefined." "The judge has given credence to a view 
long held by the press: there are cases where private interests 
must yield to public interest." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Finance Minister's Budget Speech Anticipated -- "The wisdom 
of retaining Derek Keys in the finance portfolio will be 
subjected to an acid test today when he presents the 1994/95 
Budget to the National Assembly in Cape Town," begins the 
Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 22 June in a page-10 
editorial. "There is obviously no better qualified person than 
Keys to present a `transition' Budget under the most 
extraordinary circumstances. Contradictions and dilemmas 
abound. While he is a `hangover' from the old order and is 
beholden to the eclipsed minority National Party, he now answers 
to a representative government of national unity." "Keys' 
difficult challenge is to put forward a practical fiscal plan 
able to address the interests and concerns of diverse 
constituencies." The importance of economic growth is conceded 
but the editorial laments certain attitudes that throw this 
concern into the debate on the Reconstruction and Development 
Plan. "It's the haves telling the have-nots changes in their 
lives are only possible if the wealth of the wealthy remains 
untouched. The ANC in particular has been guilty of appeasement 
and underplaying the price that all South Africans will have to 
pay to fix the damage caused by apartheid. Keys' message today 
needs to be blunt and unambiguous -- there will be a lot of pain 
before there's gain and the sooner we get on with it, the 
better."

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] The whole day today, the government and the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] discussed the 
accommodation of UNITA and its senior officials. The UNITA 
negotiating team had been in Huambo last week, where it 
consulted its leadership. However, it has brought nothing new 
to Lusaka, since it is still demanding 1,100 houses. UNITA 
wants houses in good condition and does not want to repair them. 
The government has already told UNITA that it will provide 
houses only for UNITA high officials. It is said that UNITA 
needs only 300 houses, including houses for high officials, who 
number less than 100. The government already has a well defined 
position: Either UNITA accepts what is offered to it within the 
government's capabilities, or nothing will be achieved. Today's 
talks were lengthy and the negotiating teams did not reach any 
agreement. Tomorrow, the negotiating teams will continue 
discussing this issue of housing, in the presence of the 
mediators and observers.

  [Text] The clashes are still on in the country. Kuito, 
N'dalatando, Malanje, and Benguela are the focus of tension over 
the past 24 hours. The shellings are continuing in Kuito, Bie 
Province, and the government forces are still blocking the 
enemy. Our correspondent Abel Abraao reports: 
  [Abraao] The Angolan Armed Forces [FAA], 
National Police, and civilian defense are still scoring 
victories whenever the rebel forces try to break any of the 
government lines. Unable to attack the government positions 
directly, the Black Cockerel soldiers have chosen to shell with 
its heavy artillery the major centers sheltering large crowds. 
Shells of various caliber have been fired since the early hours 
of this morning at the center of the city. The number of 
victims over the past 24 hours is not known, but hospital 
sources say that more than 15 people were killed early today. 
Well informed sources of the FAA Operation Command in Bie say 
that judging by the movements and intensified shelling of the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] 
rebels, the next few hours may hold serious violence, 
pain, and mourning for the martyred population of Kuito which 
has been (?besieged) for 502 days. 
  There is a similar situation in the city of N'dalatando, 
where UNITA is still shelling. After the UNITA rebels were 
repelled by the government forces yesterday, Savimbi's soldiers 
requested reinforcement from Huambo, Uige, and Zaire Provinces. 
Our correspondent Abilio Correia reports: 
  [Correia] Five Armed Forces for the Liberation of 
Angola [FALA] battalions that tried to occupy government forces 
positions in the west part of the city were repelled due to the 
bravery of the valorous FAA combatants, National Police, and 
civilian defense. In their disorderly retreat, 12 UNITA rebels 
were killed, and they abandoned four 82-mm mortars, five PKM 
weapons, seven AKM's, and an assortment of ammunition. 
Lieutenant General Manuel Jose Nego also said that UNITA is 
still moving soldiers and war materiel from Huambo, Zaire, and 
Uige Provinces to reinforce its positions in the outskirts of 
N'dalatando and launch a big offensive over the next few days, 
with the aim of taking the city. Today, the rebels shelled the 
city with more than 80 shells from long-range guns between dawn 
and 0900. The N'dalatando residents yesterday had a bloody day 
because the Black Cockerel shelling killed 50 people, mostly 
children, and wounded 80 others. 
  In the city of Malanje the situation is very different. The 
FAA were able to reverse the situation, killing 54 UNITA 
members. Francisco Curingana reports: 
  [Curingana] Brigadier (Ozoi), commander of the Malanje 
Operation Command, says in the operation an assortment of 
military equipment was recovered, including 39 AKM weapons, four 
PKM machineguns, two G-3 automatic arms, four U.S.-made antitank 
missiles, a radio [words indistinct]. Still at dawn, 
precisely at midnight [as heard], the rebel group was 
repelled by the civilian defense when they tried to place 
dynamite under houses belonging to civilians. Four rebels were 
killed, and an assortment of war materiel was recovered. 
  In Benguela Province, Savimbi's soldiers attacked a convoy 
of 
vehicles carrying foodstuffs for the Ganda District residents. 
The prompt intervention of the government forces blocked the 
rebels' plans. Our correspondent Julio Marinheiro reports: 
  [Marinheiro] The FAA thwarted the plans of Jonas 
Savimbi's men, killing nine rebels and capturing an assortment 
of war equipment. Jose Manuel Moreno, Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola's first secretary in Benguela, who reported 
this in Ganda, said that the UNITA actions are aimed at 
hindering his government's efforts to solve the people's 
problems. 
  [Moreno] UNITA yesterday prevented a food convoy from 
arriving in this district and has been creating obstacles on the 
road linking Cubal to Ganda District, and this hinders any kind 
of assistance the government may eventually plan for this 
district.

  [Text] Fierce clashes are taking place in N'dalatando, the 
capital of Cuanza Norte Province, where Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] troops tried to link 
N'dalatando to Malanje. 
  Over the past few days the Armed Forces for the Liberation 
of 
Angola [FALA] blocked the warmongering adventure of the Futungo 
de Belas, which with impressive war equipment tried to break the 
FALA defensive lines. FALA's prompt response forced Eduardo dos 
Santos' troops to retreat 25 km following hard clashes in Pamba. 
At present, everything is secure in the city of N'dalatando. 
Our correspondent Felix Miranda reports from Soyo: 
  [Miranda] The situation in N'dalatando deteriorated 
over the past few days when an enormous People's Armed Forces 
for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] convoy made up 
of about 105 vehicles, carrying troops and war materiel to 
assist its regiments [words indistinct] with about 15 
armored vehicles. [passage indistinct] 
  The UNITA armed forces over the past few days destroyed a 
war 
helicopter, more than 10 armored vehicles, and captured an 
assortment of military equipment, including 15 troop transports, 
15 radios, and two D-30 guns. 
  Since the Luanda Communist government began intense air and 
ground raids all over the country on 29 May 1994, the residents 
of the plateau city of Bie [Kuito] have never experienced peace. 
Incessant air raids by Eduardo dos Santos' air force have been 
causing numerous victims, particularly in the most vulnerable 
group of the society -- old people, women, and children. The 
situation has grown worse over the past five days. Our 
correspondent Jardo Prata reports: 
  [Prata] Between 16 and 20 June, more than 300 powerful 
bombs were dropped by Sukhoi MiG's [as heard] over Cantifula, 
Fatima, (Quiluto), (Candanga), and (Calumpanga) wards. The two 
last wards are located more than 15 km from the city of Bie. The 
human and material losses are extensive. 
  Meanwhile, Eduardo dos Santos' war aircraft once again 
bombed 
civilian wards and settlements today. 
  [Prata] This morning, Eduardo dos Santos' MiGs once 
again bombed (Tecnicombe) and Popular wards twice. In this 
murderous rampage, at least three people were killed, a 
29-year-old woman carrying her baby and an 18-year-old girl.

  [Excerpt] Bujumbura, 22 Jun (PANA) -- In a statement on 
state television in Bujumbura yesterday evening, Burundian 
Foreign Minister Jean-Marie Ngendahayo dismissed any possibility 
of transit on Burundian territory "for French troops and 
weapons." 
  This has been the first official reaction from Bujumbura 
since France announced its intention to send troops to Rwanda on 
a "humanitarian action." 
  In the view of the Tutsi community -- the minority 
opposition 
group both in Rwanda and Burundi -- this action is not a 
humanitarian one and it shows that France is continuing its old 
policy of military cooperation with the Rwandan Presidential 
Guard, who are now accused of committing genocide in the country. 
  When interviewed on the huge successive street 
demonstrations 
and marches in Bujumbura in the past two days, marking 
opposition to the French initiative, the Burundian minister 
simply said that "Burundi's international policy is not carried 
out on the streets." 
  It may be recalled that in addition to students, the 
opposition coalition urged the Burundians to show their 
opposition to the French intervention in Rwanda. This 
initiative mobilized a crowd of demonstrators of about 20,000 
according to the organizers, and 10,000 according to Burundian 
police sources in Bujumbura yesterday afternoon. 
  The demonstrators brandished slogans denouncing "France's 
cynicism" and urged African countries not to "back France in the 
execution of its sinister plan for the extermination of an 
entire nation." 
  The various party leaders who spoke at the end of the march 
to emphasize its importance expressed fears, which may be real 
or imagined, that the "French Army's next move could be Burundi." 
  According to a Bujumbura parliamentarian, Francois Ngeze, 
"irresponsibility on the part of a certain class of politicians 
could in the future offer the same excuse of internal disorder 
to bring in and justify foreign intervention in Burundi." 
  The parliamentarian who was recently released from the house 
arrest he was placed under following the bloody October 1993 
coup does not think that the real problem in the Great Lake 
Region is an ethnic one "as the outside world very often has the 
tendency of portraying it." Mr. Ngeze stated vehemently that it 
is "not an ethnic problem but rather one linked to politicians' 
amateurism. 
  He, however, did not deny the "Burundian opposition's 
unconditional support for the Rwandan Patriotic Front's struggle 
for democracy and lasting peace in Rwanda and in the region." 
  In the same vein, Mr. Ngeze stated that the Burundian 
opposition coalition was determined to "install a president of 
its choice if the Burundian ruling party enforced such a 
decision without the consent of all the moral and political 
forces in the country." 
  Several observers think that the parliamentarian's 
statements 
is another source of concern in Burundi. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Brazzaville, 22 June (PANA) -- The Congolese 
foreign affairs minister, Benjamin Bounkoulou, has reiterated 
his country's support to the creation of the United Nations 
Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR II) to save lives and put 
an end to the wanton killings. 
  In a press statement released Tuesday [21 June] in 
Brazzaville, Bounkoulou recalled that Congo was not only 
involved in the OAU military observer mission, but also supports 
the further expansion of the United Nations [words indistinct] 
in that war torn country. 
  Congo has accepted to contribute 300 troops to Rwanda within 
the framework of the proposed UNAMIR. One hundred troops 
already volunteered to go to Rwanda while 200 others will be 
chosen by the government. Already, 25 Congolese troops were 
[words indistinct] the UNAMIR. [passage omitted] 
  Congo is among the 16 African countries asked by the United 
Nations to send 5,500 troops to Rwanda to carry out humanitarian 
assignments and peace-keeping work.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer Daniel Bilalian] France is still 
preparing a humanitarian and military operation in order to try 
and put an end to massacres in Rwanda. [passage omitted] 
  Let us now join on the ground the only, or one of the very 
last European journalists there, Laurent Boussie. Laurent, can 
you hear me? 
  [Boussie] Yes, absolutely, Daniel. 
  [Bilalian] Laurent, we have heard that this morning the RPF 
[Rwandan Patriotic Front] rebel forces launched a major 
offensive on the capital, as if they wanted to be ahead of 
France or any foreign action. 
  [Boussie] Listen, Daniel, according to the information given 
to us by the UN officials, this is the largest offensive ever 
against the capital. This offensive woke us at 0300 with very 
intense shelling from RPF positions onto government ones. A bit 
later, around 0500-0530, there was infantry shelling in addition 
to artillery shelling. Machine guns could be heard [words 
indistinct] and shells continued falling uninterrupted. This 
offensive lasted until almost noon today, which means that this 
is an extremely significant offensive, with a lot of firing, 
with a lot of ammunition used. 
  For about 30 minutes now, it seems that a certain calm has 
prevailed: The noise and smoke have slightly subsided, there is 
a bit less artillery firing and, according to the latest news, 
which is reported to have been gathered -- reported only, 
because I have not seen this for myself, obviously, I am not 
directly on the front line right now, but according to the 
latest news -- the RPF, that is, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, is 
reported to have gained ground. 
  [Bilalian] As the possible French intervention in Rwanda is 
drawing closer -- this is still on the cards -- it has been said 
that those francophone African forces with the United Nations -- 
that is, the Senegalese, the Togolese, the Congolese -- have 
received threats from the rebels and that these contingents want 
to leave. Have they left this morning? 
  [Boussie] Listen, they wanted to leave yesterday. This 
morning, the Senegalese and the Togolese left -- or rather, they 
got into trucks and buses. They started to drive off and they 
are reported to have been -- reported only -- stopped outside 
the town. They are reported to have been searched, they are even 
reported to have had some of their belongings taken away. They 
are reported to have then been able to leave and to drive on but 
I have no more news for the time being. What is certain is the 
fact that the francophone contingents have left the UN 
headquarters here, in Kigali. 
  [Bilalian] When we listen to you, we get the impression that 
anyone who is francophone -- whether they are troops, 
journalists, or diplomats in Rwanda -- is now in danger. Are 
you stuck yourself, Laurent? 
  [Boussie] Listen. For the time being, we -- myself and the 
France 2 team, that is, Jean-Marie Lemaire and Gerard Flegeot -- 
are inside the UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] command 
post, that is, the UN command post. We can go out from time to 
time, but we are very careful: When we want to cross the front 
line, we leave with UN cars and I must say that, sometimes, we 
are quite frightened in town. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>
  [Excerpt] Kigali, 22 Jun (AFP) -- Rwandan rebels waged a 
major offensive Wednesday [22 June] to take control of this 
capital city as France pressed ahead with controversial plans to 
intervene in the ethnic civil war. As the fighting intensified, 
the UN mission here sent its French-speaking troops out of the 
capital because of rebel warnings that all French-speaking 
soldiers could be targets in the event of French intervention. 
  The Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) launched the 
offensive late Tuesday, bringing a company of reinforcements 
forward from the northeast of Kigali and pounding the city 
centre with artillery, observers in the UN Assistance Mission in 
Rwanda (UNAMIR) said Wednesday. UN military spokesman Jean-Guy 
Plante said that the fighting in Kigali was so fierce that the 
United Nations on Tuesday withdrew its observers and guards from 
the Mille Collines Hotel, which has become a refugee hostel in 
the centre of the city. 
  The United Nations has also again suspended trade-off 
evacuations of Hutus and Tutsis to relative safety from behind 
the enemy front lines, after a lull enabled the moving of two 
groups of 300 people on Monday. 
  Forty-two UN troops from Senegal, Congo and Togo left the 
capital by road for Uganda, several hours after they had been 
due to leave. Their departure was delayed as the rebels searched 
their luggage before allowing them to go. They planned to fly 
from Uganda to Nairobi. Kigali airport, jointly controlled by 
the UN mission and the rebels, remained closed on Wednesday. 
  General Romeo Dallaire, the UN military chief in Rwanda, 
decided to send the soldiers to safety after the RPF warned that 
if France launched an intervention it bitterly opposes, its men 
might not distinguish between French and French-speaking UN 
troops. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Michel Bellemare: "France's Image Tarnished"] </F>
  [Text] New York -- "What can one do against all these 
powers which have united? There is a complicity, we have seen 
this. We feel frustrated, but we are not for this reason going 
to commit suicide." Faustin Twagiramungu (a Hutu by race), the 
prime minister-designate as stipulated in the Arusha accords 
(footnote) (peace agreement signed in August 1993 at Arusha in 
Tanzania which provided for a transition period until general 
elections) and seen as a moderate, lacked his full verve as he 
waited yesterday morning in his New York hotel room for the 
Security Council decision on France's plans to send a 
humanitarian intervention force to Rwanda. "UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali told me on Monday [20 June] that, even if it 
were the devil, he would send him to Rwanda to save people from 
the situation prevailing right now. As France is presenting 
itself while no other Western capital seems ready to get 
involved, it appears that France will go to Rwanda." 
  Just like the supporters of the Rwandan Patriotic Front 
(RPF), Faustin Twagiramungu and his party, the Democratic 
Republic Movement, are against the sending of a French force to 
Rwanda, without however approving the use of force against 
French Blue Helmets sent to his country. He has been repeating 
this position since his visit to Montreal on Sunday. The fact 
is that he suspects Paris of having a hidden plan which seeks to 
support the Rwandan military. "These soldiers and the 
presidential guard have been trained by France," he said. "They 
have made life difficult for us since the beginning of April and 
are massacring us. Personally, I cannot forget that I only just 
escaped death. The presidential guard came knocking at my door 
to assassinate me, but I had been warned. All my colleagues 
have been killed. I must fight everything which could put these 
soldiers in a position of force." 
  The prime minister-designate's idea was to convince Canadian 
Prime Minister Jean Chretien, whom he was due to meet this week, 
to take the initiative instead of France. Convinced that he had 
lost his battle against the Security Council, however, he 
dropped the idea. "Why is France suddenly interested in 
Rwanda, after three months of fighting? It would be much better 
if countries like Canada, the Netherlands, or Italy, which have 
not been caught up in these neocolonialist stories, were to 
become involved. France does not inspire confidence. It could 
have intervened, with international consent, from the start. It 
could have saved lives. But, now, its image is tarnished and it 
wants to show the rest of the world that it is not the bad guy." 
  In addition to these reasons, which he advances to justify 
his opposition to the deployment of French soldiers in Rwanda, 
Faustin Twagiramungu complains that France did not consult him: 
"Of course, we would have liked to have been consulted. We 
would have asked for explanations. But we learned that the 
French soldiers are going to leave, and that they are already 
stationed somewhere in Zaire. This is a little abnormal. We 
should have been informed... But if the French go there to halt 
the massacres as they say, by attempting to bring to heel the 
soldiers who are doing the killing and trying to gain control of 
the presidential guard which they themselves trained, that would 
finally be a positive step. Obviously, this is a high-risk 
operation. But for us, the important thing is that UNAMIR-2 [UN 
Assistance Mission in Rwanda] be put into place, as well as the 
democratic institutions provided for in the Arusha accords.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with RPF Chairman Alex Kanyarengwe by </F>
Alain Frilet in Mulindi on 21 June: "Paris Wants To Maintain 
the Regime at Any Price"] 
  [Text] Mulindi -- Ten kilometers from the Ugandan border, 
on a eucalyptus-planted hill, is where the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front (RPF) has established its headquarters since the beginning 
of the war in October 1990. The deserted Mulundi village has 
been transformed into barracks. The adobe houses where the tea 
plantation workers used to live are now occupied by RPF 
soldiers, whereas the managers' homes are reserved for the 
general staff. It is in one of these houses that RPF Chairman 
Alex Kanyarengwe received us yesterday, just as he learnt about 
the arrival of the first French troops in Zaire. 
  [Frilet] Do you believe in the sincerity of the French 
initiative intended to bring humanitarian aid to the civilian 
victims of the massacres that took place in your country? 
  [Kanyarengwe] France has been present in Rwanda ever since 
the civil war broke out in October 1990. Right from the first 
few days, it sent a military contingent to evacuate French 
nationals from Kigali, saying that it would withdraw its troops 
as soon as they had carried out their mission. However, it 
became immediately apparent that Paris did not want the RPF to 
win. We had to wait for the Americans to intervene -- upholding 
the implementation of the Arusha peace agreements -- before the 
French accepted to leave. 
  [Frilet] Some analysts think that France's present 
initiative 
is mainly intended to enable it to reestablish itself in a 
neutral position after its neutrality was called into question 
because it supported a regime which is responsible for many 
massacres. 
  [Kanyarengwe] The tragedy we are living through is the 
result 
of all of France's dealings and maneuvers aimed at keeping 
President Habyarimana's ruling party in power. This was a 
completely dictatorial regime which was repeatedly denounced for 
having perpetrated massacres and political assassinations. 
France propped it up by keeping troops and diplomats stationed 
in the country, as well as by providing considerable funds. It 
is only natural for France to feel responsible for this tragedy 
and to try now to prevent the disappearance of the MRND 
[National Revolutionary Movement for Development] (the former 
single party), and, above all, prevent international inquiries 
which might bring to light France's complicity in the actions 
carried out by those in power. 
  However, these inquiries must be conducted normally and 
those 
responsible for the massacres must be brought to trial. Right 
from the beginning of the reprisals, all the other countries 
left once they had evacuated their nationals. France stayed on, 
and it could have appealed to the United Nations not to withdraw 
the 2,500 Blue Helmets. As an influential member of the 
Security Council, it could have demanded a stop to the massacres 
by requesting a strengthening of the UN presence. Furthermore, 
considering that France continued to maintain military, 
political, and diplomatic links with the government, it could 
have asked its "acolytes" to put a stop to the massacres. 
  [Frilet] Therefore, in your view some secret plan lies 
behind 
the French humanitarian initiative... 
  [Kanyarengwe] In the French statements, you can always read, 
behind humanitarian reasons and between the lines, the notion of 
intervention. President Mitterrand himself suggested as much in 
his televised statement on the occasion of the closing of the 6 
June [D-Day] ceremonies. In this way, they want to link the 
fighting between the RPF and the government forces to the 
massacres perpetrated against the civilian population suspected 
of supporting the RPF. 
  [Frilet] From a military point of view, does a link exist 
between the imminent vote in the Security Council and the 
stepping up of your military campaign? 
  [Kanyarengwe] Not in the least. The recent progress made by 
our troops eastward and southward has nothing to do with this 
decision. With regard to the battles we are waging for the 
capital of Kigali, they result from our strategy which is based 
on conducting an attrition war in the urban centers and a 
blitzkrieg in the countryside, so as to save as many human lives 
as possible. 
  [Frilet] If you continue your advance throughout the 
country's territory, of which you now control two-thirds, would 
you be prepared to accept the surrender of the government forces? 
  [Kanyarengwe] We would prefer a measure of consensus on 
their 
part in order to agree on the means to be used to reconstruct 
the country. We are prepared to accept the MRND in the spirit 
of the Arusha peace accords, which constitute a political 
framework for reconstructing our country, provided that the 
MRND's members are prepared to be held answerable for their 
actions. Of course, the MRND's role as defined in the Arusha 
agreements will have to be reviewed in the light of its 
responsibility for the tragedy we are living through. This is 
why we have insisted on an international inquiry being held on 
the crimes that have been committed. 
  [Frilet] France's former ambassador to Rwanda wishes to come 
here to present the French initiative. Are you prepared to 
receive him? 
  [Kanyarengwe] All contacts are interesting. He is scheduled 
to arrive on Wednesday, and I see no objection to receiving him. 
  [Frilet] What would be the consequences if, as you suggest 
may happen, France becomes involved in the war in Rwanda? 
  [Kanyarengwe] If France intervenes militarily, the war will 
change and may become worse. The population, which France says 
it wants to help, will itself become the victim of this 
situation. Moreover, the whole region may flare up. Both Zaire 
and Burundi have the same geographical patterns and the same 
types of population. The whole region would therefore feel 
concerned. 
  [Frilet] In Paris, the RPF is considered a Tutsi minority 
movement, with a 15-percent share of the vote at the most. It 
is hard to imagine that you will hand over power to the winner 
in the elections which you are committed to hold once peace has 
been reestablished. 
  [Kanyarengwe] You Westerners tell us to follow your model of 
democracy. I thought democracy must be judged from actions and 
ideas. Democracy is acquired by adhering to a certain type of 
politics and a social program. We cannot envisage democracy 
under an ethnic mantle which fosters privileges and exclusion. 
This, however, was the situation under the government which 
France supported and is still trying to maintain in power at all 
costs.

  [Text] Kinshasa, June 22 (AFP) -- France Wednesday [22 
June] rushed troops, helicopters and vehicles to central Africa 
in preparation for an intervention to protect Tutsis grouped in 
refugee camps in western Rwanda, witnesses and official sources 
said. 
  French Defense Minister Francois Leotard said in Paris that 
the French troops would launch a limited operation to protect 
the Tutsis and it could begin as early as Thursday, once the UN 
Security Council authorized the intervention. The council gave 
the go-ahead hours later. 
  The commander of the French joint chiefs of staff, Admiral 
Jacques Lanxade, said a first contingent of 600 troops would be 
deployed once the operation got under way. 
  Here in Zaire, two huge French transport planes unloaded 
troops in the towns of Goma, near the Rwandan border, and 
Bukavu, just across the Ruzizi River from Rwanda, sources in 
Goma said. 
  Lanxade in Paris said a total of 200 troops were in these 
two 
towns and a third, Kisangani. 
  In Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic, 
three 
transport planes chartered from the Russian carrier Aeroflot 
began disgorging helicopters and vehicles at the city's airport. 
  At an adjacent French military air base, six other large 
transport planes could be seen, with military vehicles on the 
perimeter of the air field. 
  France has 1,400 troops stationed permanently in the Central 
African Republic. 
  Leotard said 2,500 French soldiers would be involved in what 
he described as a humanitarian operation. Lanxade said 500 
vehicles and 40 planes would be used. 
  Leotard said the French troops would only be deployed in 
parts of western Rwanda controlled by the ethnic Hutu 
government, which has been accused of responsibility for most of 
the hundreds of thousands of ethnic killings that have rocked 
Rwanda for the past 10 weeks. 
  Tutsi-led rebels who control the north of Rwanda and were 
engaged in a major offensive Wednesday to capture the capital 
Kigali have refused to allow French troops into their zones. 
  They blame Paris for supporting and arming the Hutu 
authorities despite evidence they were involved in the 
systematic slaughter of minority Tutsis.

  [Text] Operation Turquoise has started. French troops have 
arrived in Goma in eastern Zaire, and Jaguars have landed in the 
northeast, at Kisangani; but for the moment no troops have 
crossed the border with Rwanda. 
  Several cargo planes are expected at 125 air base in Istres 
in Bouches-du-Rhone: They are to load up with men and military 
equipment bound for Bangui. Francois Lecazeau reports: 
  [Lecazeau] Three large Antonov cargo planes already landed 
this morning at 125 air base in Istres in Bouches-du-Rhone. 
They are to be joined by one or two more. During the day, they 
will take on several tonnes of military equipment, and units 
bound for the Rwandan border, including 80 troops from the 
Mediterranean Air Region. 
  For the moment the authorities are being cagey about the 
exact mission of these men. The planes are to take off at about 
midday for Bangui, in the Central African Republic, and then for 
Goma and Bukavu, on the border between Zaire and Rwanda, to join 
the bulk of the troops of Operation Turquoise whose job is to 
help the people of Rwanda.

  [Text] Back to Rwanda for the second part of this bulletin, 
with our guest, OAU Deputy Secretary General Pascal Ngayama. 
  The Organization of African Unity announced yesterday that 
it 
did not support French intervention in Rwanda. In a communique, 
the OAU--which groups together 53 member countries--says that 
the way this operation is being prepared, including the fact 
that all the belligerents have not agreed to it, is extremely 
risky. Ghislaine Dupont asked Ngayama why the OAU rejected 
French intervention, although it accepted that of UN soldiers: 
  [Begin recording] [Ngayama] What is still rather curious--or 
rather sad, if you like, in that kind of situation--is that 
individual states always find the means to act, but they never 
find any means in a concerted fashion. This is what is 
happening, in a way. We would like more consultations. 
  [Dupont] Do you mean that France has acted alone in this 
venture? 
  [Ngayama] In a way, because one resolution has been adopted 
by the United Nations, and another will most probably have to be 
adopted in order to give the go ahead to the action begun by 
France. However, we would have liked to have as much cooperation 
from the sides as possible. It would, of course, be deplorable 
if one side did not cooperate, because it would have been 
necessary for this side--the Rwandan Patriotic Front, in 
particular--to really cooperate. Having said that, it goes 
without saying that this does not mean that the OAU is 
discouraged or does not wish the [word indistinct] to succeed. 
  It is just the opposite. We think we need to surround 
ourselves with the greatest possible number of precautions, to 
get the greatest possible agreement between all the sides, in 
order to ensure that the action being undertaken can find some 
support from everyone, in order to guarantee the desired success. 
  [Dupont] Do you support the Senegalese decision to agree to 
participate in this humanitarian intervention force? 
  [Ngayama] There is no doubt that any state, any member of 
the 
OAU or of the international community, is perfectly free to 
participate in this action--even if, let me say it again, this 
action is not, let us say, in contradiction with what has been 
done. [sentence as heard] 
  The aim of the OAU and of the international community, we 
are 
sure, is to arrive at a solution in accordance with the Arusha 
agreements and to stop the massacres and end the hostilities. 
There is no doubt about this. The OAU is a bit concerned that, 
perhaps, by acting alone this might be a hindrance. 
  [Dupont] In the end, however, does not this dramatic crisis 
in Rwanda show the impotence of the OAU, which, after all, tried 
to create a mechanism to prevent conflicts more than a year ago 
now? Is accusing France of going it alone not tantamount to 
saying that the continent, the organization of this continent, 
cannot do anything? 
  [Ngayama] No, do not think that. The OAU is working in 
consultation with the United Nations, which has the main mandate 
for maintaining peace and security in the world. There is not 
one specifically African security in which only Africans are 
involved. There is international security for which the United 
Nations has a specific mandate. So we have a mechanism that 
complements that of the United Nations. It is not a parallel 
mechanism. 
  What we have established, in agreement with the United 
Nations, is to supply what we were told the international 
community was not able to supply: troops, for example, to 
implement the decision of the United Nations. We are waiting 
for the logistical support that the African states do not have 
to be supplied by the international community or by the United 
Nations. That is really what it is. 
  What has happened, however, is as if these efforts were 
viewed poorly, or did not deserve interest or consideration or 
to be supported. One individual state preferred to act alone. 
The OAU decries a situation that it would have welcomed 
normally, if it had been integrated into the context of the 
efforts that we have always made with our partners in the 
international community as a whole, including Africa's main 
partners, certain great powers: France, the United States, 
Germany, Belgium, and so on, as has always happened before. [end

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Now SA can get down to business] </F>
  [Text] South Africa's transition to democracy could never 
have been without pain, and there will be those who criticise 
Finance Minister Derek Keys for deciding to load the cost burden 
of that process onto middle-class and wealthy individuals and 
private sector businesses. 
  If the critics ignore other factors and simply denigrate the 
first Budget of a majority government because of the 5 percent 
transitional levy, they will do Keys and his collaborators an 
injustice. Keys has produced a Budget designed to generate the 
soundly based growth we need if the economy is to create jobs 
and allow the fair distribution of wealth and the social 
spending necessary for national stability. He had no choice but 
to put growth above all other considerations, and with this 
year's Budget he should succeed, while helping government avoid 
the temptation of fiscal indiscipline. 
  There will be some gripes about the higher excise duties on 
tobacco and alcoholic products. But the new intention that 
increases in excise duties should match price increases is wise. 
  Keys trod a fine line over VAT [value-added tax]. He appears 
sensibly to have resisted pressures to zero-rate more 
foodstuffs. Variable VAT rates would add to the complexities of 
collecting the tax which is likely to become an increasingly 
important source of government income as economic restructuring 
progresses. But the Finance Minister apparently had to pay the 
political price of that by not increasing the overall VAT rate. 
<H5>  Realities </H5>
  The decision not to change VAT highlights South Africa's new 
political realities. The majority of people who elected the new 
government are relatively poor. Until their standards of living 
are raised, they will continue to oppose taxes like VAT which, 
whatever their advantages, are regressive. Social services will 
continue to be directed increasingly towards the most needy. 
  Some sleight of hand has cut the budgeted deficit before 
borrowing to 6.6 percent of GDP [gross domestic product] from 
last year's 6.9 percent. GDP has been increased by 5.6 percent 
-- an estimate of the contribution of the ill-measured informal 
sector. Calculated on the older, more conventional basis, the 
Budget deficit would have been 7 percent -- visibly higher than 
the 6 percent promised to the IMF but still an acceptable level 
for a Budget that has to put growth above all else. 
  Growth cannot be achieved without investment, and the 
proposed cut in the corporate income tax rate, in part offset by 
the higher 25 percent secondary tax on companies (a tax on 
distributed profits), should encourage it. The scrapping of the 
import surcharge on capital and intermediate goods will also 
help. Investment yields will be enhanced by the lower corporate 
tax rate while companies will be encouraged by the higher STC 
[secondary tax on companies] to retain and reinvest earnings. 
<H5>  Flexibility </H5>
  Keys was right not to introduce a capital gains tax that 
would deter investment. That will be addressed by the new Tax 
Advisory Committee, but it will be addressed in parallel with 
Inland Revenue's proposals to facilitate corporate unbundling 
and rationalisation. 
  The Finance Minister would have done well to eliminate the 
marketable securities tax that is regularly criticised by 
foreign investors. He has, however, made a start on improving 
the flexibility of financial markets with the new public debt 
management proposals. Financing of government deficits as they 
arise should create a more active market in government stock. 
Couple that with the new system of depositing tax and loan 
receipts with the commercial banks, and most of the market 
distortions inherent in the previous system will be eliminated. 
In addition, government funding should become more sensitive to 
market trends. 
  Many investors here and abroad remain wary of South Africa's 
new government. It has still to prove its credentials 
conclusively and, as a result, it is likely to be under greater 
scrutiny than its predecessor. This Budget has set the tone, 
and has shown that government's financial planners believe the 
business of South Africa can be business.

  [Text] Johannesburg June 22 SAPA -- A phased approach to 
financing the government's Reconstruction and Development 
Programme [RDP] was "eminently sensible", the South African 
Chamber of Business [SACOB] said in reaction to the budget on 
Wednesday [22 June]. SACOB welcomed the reduction in the 
standard corporate tax rate, the removal of certain import 
surcharges and the maintaining of the value added tax (VAT) 
rate, saying these would encourage economic growth. 
  "Given the extraordinary increase in expenditure directly 
linked to the transition, the Minister (of Finance Mr Derek 
Keys) has been bold in dealing with the matter directly." 
  SACOB said the appointment of a commission of inquiry into 
taxation avoided immediate tax decisions and prolonged 
uncertainty about a future tax regime. "It is to be regretted 
that the overall effect of the tax changes has been to increase 
the burden on individuals at a time when personal savings are 
still at a low level and the effect of budget creep on 
individuals has not been addressed."

  [Text] Johannesburg June 22 SAPA -- The five per cent 
transition levy had the potential to cause conflict between 
workers and the government, the National Council of Trade Unions 
[Nactu] warned on Wednesday [22 June]. Reacting to the 1994/5 
budget announced by Finance Minister Derek Keys, Nactu said it 
believed the levy, its percentage and period should have been 
negotiated. 
  It was "ironic" the minister could tax workers and companies 
the same levy and the lack of consultation was "business as 
usual from the old apartheid regime style of doing things". 
  "We don't even know how the R4 billion [rand] of 
transitional 
costs was incurred," said Nactu Assistant General Secretary 
Mahlomola Skhosana. 
  Nactu had always stood for a negotiated levy towards 
specific 
programmes such as education and training in the Reconstruction 
and Development Programme. The R2.5 billion kick-start to the 
programme was a "drop in the ocean compared to the general needs 
of people", said Mr Skhosana. 
  Nactu was also concerned the government would settle the R15 
billion debt incurred by the former TVBC [Transkei, 
Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states instead of investing it in 
the development programme, the statement said. 
  Nactu welcomed the establishment of a tax commission, saying 
it was long overdue. "We hope the commission will act with 
integrity and consult every stakeholder and all trade union 
national centres, instead of some and not others."

  [Text] Cape Town June 22 SAPA -- The budget would stimulate 
economic growth while making substantial provision for social 
services, the National Party [NP] said in a statement on 
Wednesday [22 June]. Commenting on Finance Minister Derek Keys's 
budget speech, NP spokesman Danie du Plessis said the budget was 
the product of negotiation within the government of national 
unity and contained sufficient elements to promote growth. 
  However, he expressed reservations about the one-off levy to 
cover the costs of the transition. 
  "The functioning of the Independent Electoral Commission and 
its lack of financial discipline which the taxpayer now has to 
account for is an example of how state expenditure should not 
occur." 
  If the government kept strictly to the budget, South Africa 
would reap the fruits. But if insufficient discipline was 
exercised over state expenditure, taxpayers would face an 
increasing burden. 
  "Extravagant promises by some ANC ministers have already 
made 
the danger lights flicker. All ministers must now realise that 
they can only make promises within the framework of the budget."

  [Text] Pretoria June 22 SAPA -- The Conservative Party [CP] 
on Wednesday [22 June] strongly objected to the five per cent 
levy on income tax imposed on "already overtaxed taxpayers". 
  "The CP strongly objects to the squandering of R4 billion 
[rand] by the Transitional Executive Council and the Independent 
Electoral Commission," the party's finance spokesman Cas Uys 
said in a statement. He said the amount now had to be made up 
for through a five per cent levy. 
  Mr Uys said the insufficient increase in social, military 
and 
civil pensions resulted in a further lowering of living 
standards in a sector of the community which, in some cases, was 
already below the breadline. "The budgeted shortage in the 
current financial year of R29.3 billion will once more result in 
a drastic increase in government debt," he said. 
  He said if the government did not succeed in bringing about 
law and order and stability there would be no influx of capital 
to South Africa and its entrance to international markets would 
fail.

  [Text] Cape Town June 22 SAPA -- Minister of Finance Mr 
Derek Keys unfortunately went primarily for soft targets in 
Wednesday's [22 June] budget, said Democratic Party [DP] finance 
spokesman Ken Andrew. He said in a statement middle-income 
taxpayers would be hardest hit. Individual taxes were up 18.4 
per cent and had more than doubled in the past five years. 
  The R6.5 billion [rand] additional revenue from taxes on 
individuals' incomes was "the highest ever". 
  The government was still living beyond its means. Continued 
budget deficits were mortgaging South Africa's future and 
pushing it ever closer to the debt trap that had financially 
ruined many developing countries. 
  Mr Andrew said the government should have cut defence 
spending, not increased it by 13 per cent. In contrast, spending 
on police was up by only 6.5 per cent, less than the inflation 
rate, at a time when crime was rampant. This made no sense. 
  The DP was not opposed in principle to the one-off levy to 
finance South Africa's transition to democracy but was alarmed 
by the enormous cost of the transition. The party would question 
whether the money had been properly spent and adequately 
controlled.

  [Text] Pretoria June 22 SAPA -- The poor and defenceless 
individual taxpayer, who already carried most of the tax burden, 
would have to cough up yet again, the Freedom Front [FF] said on 
Wednesday in its reaction to the budget. FF financial spokesman 
Dr Willie Botha said most of the transition expenditures which 
the taxpayer had to foot had been been unnecessary. 
  The failed National Peacekeeping Force had cost the taxpayer 
R395 million [rand] and the Independent Electoral Commission had 
overshot its budget by R700 million. 
  Dr Botha added that the measures envisaged to stimulate 
growth would have a negligible impact on job creation. The 
danger existed that those who qualified for these benefits would 
benefit themselves, rather than create jobs. 
  He said it was difficult to imagine how economic growth 
alone 
would meet the increasing demands of the Reconstruction and 
Development Programme. 
  According to Dr Botha foreign investment would probably only 
be realised after the first real african national congress 
budget in 1995, provided the ANC indicated its support for a 
free market economy.

  [Text] Johannesburg June 22 SAPA -- This year's budget is 
"a laudable attempt" to deal with problems head-on and build on 
sound fiscal growth, but financial discipline will determine if 
the shocks have only been delayed until next year, Syfrets 
[financial institution] economist Elmien de Kock said in a 
statement on Wednesday. [22 June] 
  "It is not a redistribution budget; it's a reconstruction 
budget," she said. 
  "It is only by increasing the economic pie that the 
underprivileged can benefit from wealth redistribution...The 
only way the government can sustain an increase in revenue is by 
growing the tax base." 
  The one-off five per cent levy to finance the country's 
transition to democracy would hurt high-income individuals 
without curbing consumer spending because most breadwinners were 
not affected. 
  The deficit before borrowing of R29.6 billion [rand] was not 
onerous because it included transition costs of R4 billion. 
  Mrs de Kock said Syfrets expected a negative reaction 
initially from capital markets but there was potential for lower 
bond yields. 
  The financial rand would not be abolished in the next six 
months, she said. 
  The corporate tax rate cut would offset the transition levy. 
Companies with low dividend cover would most likely be adversely 
affected, while those with average cover would lose about four 
per cent in earnings per share. 
  Beer and tobacco tax rises would not substantially affect 
sales volumes. 
  The construction sector had reacted positively to pre-budget 
announcements on job creation and public works programmes, Mrs 
de Kock said.

  [Text] Japan's ambassador to South Africa, Mr. Katsumi 
Sezaki, says prospects of increased trade between the two 
countries are good but that direct investment is less likely. 
Speaking in Durban he said that at present South Africa had no 
special advantage over Asian countries and that it would have to 
adopt a clearer strategy to attract foreign investors. 
Referring to trade, Mr. Sezaki said a likely upturn in the 
Japanese economy by the end of the year will result in increased 
imports from South Africa. He also disclosed that Japan was 
examining ways of increasing aid to South Africa and said an 
economic cooperation mission would visit the country next week 
for talks with the government on the Reconstruction and 
Development Program.

  [Text] Parliament June 22 SAPA -- Serious shortcomings had 
developed in both the combat and logistical support capabilities 
of the South African National Defence Force [SANDF] because of 
cutbacks in defence spending, the SANDF said on Wednesday [22 
June]. A document released by the chief of the SANDF, Gen Georg 
Meiring, said the defence budget would have to increase in 
future years. 
  The defence allocation had declined by 44 percent in real 
terms during the past five years and was now equivalent to the 
defence budget of the mid-1970s. Capital spending on armaments 
and equipment had dropped from 44 percent of the overall defence 
budget in 1989 to 28 percent last year and the SANDF could no 
longer maintain even minimum strategic technological levels. 
  "The annual reductions in the defence budget not only 
necessesitated a reduction in the diversity of capabilities 
available within the SANDF, but also caused a drastic reduction 
in the quality and depth of combat capability." 
  Gen Meiring said the costs of integrating non-statutory 
forces such Umkhonto We Sizwe [Spear of the Nation, ANC armed 
wing] into the SANDF would increase defence spending in the 
short term, as would the costs of retrenchments resulting from 
such rationalisation. 
  Although defence laid claim to a large proportion of state 
revenue, it also contributed to the national economy through 
production, employment and foreign exchange earnings. He said 
the export of armaments and related equipment had earned South 
Africa R750 million [rands] in foreign exchange between April 
1993 and January 1994. 
  While the conventional threat at present was low, South 
Africa had to maintain all its existing combat capabilities. 
Moderate, expandable force levels were needed to enable the 
SANDF to gear up to war force levels if and when needed.

  [Text] Port Elizabeth June 22 SAPA -- The new Eastern 
Province [EP] Command -- incorporating the old SA [South 
African] Defence Force and the armies of two liberation 
movements and two former homelands -- will be based in Port 
Elizabeth. EP command will comprise the African National 
Congress' Umkhonto We Sizwe [Spear of the Nation], Pan 
Africanist Congress' Azanian Peoples Liberation Army and the 
former Ciskei and Transkei Defence Forces. 
  The structure of the integrated force was outlined by Lt-Col 
J M Swanepoel at a media briefing on Tuesday [21 June] night. 
He said it had been decided early in the planning of 
integration that the new EP Command would cover the former 
Eastern Province and Border/Kei areas. 

  -  EP Command would be divided into five army districts: 
  -  Hantam Army District with its headquarters in Grahamstown; 
  -  Algoa Army District with headquarters in Port Elizabeth; 
  -  Border/Kei Army District with headquarters in East London; 
  -  East-Border Army District with headquarters in Queenstown; 
and 
  -  Transkei Army District with its headquarters in Umtata. 


    EP Command commanding officer Brig Toon Slabbert said the 
SANDF aimed to establish a strong core army, whose primary role 
would be defence. 
  Secondary roles would be to preserve life and the health of 
the population; to assist the police in maintaining order; to 
provide essential services, especially in disaster areas; and to 
support the nation's socio-economic upliftment. 
  The SANDF [South African National Defense Force] would use 
the former SADF as the core around which to develop a strong 
apolitical force with high standards and full-time and part-time 
components. 
  Brig Slabbert said with the integration of the SADF, former 
TVBC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, and Ciskei] armies and 
non-statutory forces, the SANDF could comprise about 130,000 
soldiers.

<F P=106> [Interview with Home Affairs Minister and IFP leader </F>
Mangosuthu Buthelezi by Shaun Johnson and Kaizer Nyatsumba; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  On his home affairs portfolio: </H5>
  [Buthelezi] I find it very challenging in the first place, 
because you have got civic affairs in it and therefore one has 
to do certain things for the whole population. And of course I 
find it amusing (to be Minister of Home Affairs) in view of the 
fact that the former government took away my passport for nine 
years and I am now in charge of the passports! 
<H5>  On the question of immigration: </H5>
  [Buthelezi] The second challenge (to the portfolio) is that 
it has immigration as one of its segments ... in the past there 
was discrimination...people from Europe were allowed to come 
here more easily than black people from other countries. Now 
already there are Africans from some of the southern African 
countries or even from central Africa coming in here in the hope 
of getting a job. How does one deal with that? The handling 
seems to me to be a very sensitive thing because the needs of 
South Africans are so vast...charity begins at home, while (at 
the same time Africans) are our brothers and sisters. Last week 
I had lunch with bankers from Switzerland, and one said he had 
never heard so much French spoken in South Africa. That really 
indicates what is going on now. 
<H5>  On his experience with the new Cabinet: </H5>
  [Buthelezi] I find that the cordiality (among) all of us is 
really quite something because, to be quite honest, I sit there 
facing some people who have really been vilifying me -- but I 
have no animosity towards them and we joke. From that point of 
view I think it is some kind of a miracle, really. 
<H5>  On the Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP]: </H5>
  [Buthelezi] I think it (the RDP) is one of the best (pieces 
of) writing I have ever seen. On the face of it, it has many 
platitudes which no one would have any problem about. And also 
as far as our economic policy is concerned there are many things 
(in the RDP) which are the same. But my worry is: can one 
deliver from the point of view of the fiscus? I have expressed 
this concern in Cabinet, because the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] 
does not like too much intervention by the State in the economy. 
But we are doing the best (we can) together, we are 
co-operating. We'll try to do the best to deliver in terms of 
it. 
<H5>  On the RDP and the Province: </H5>
  [Buthelezi] Responding to the President's speech I did state 
my own feeling about deliver -- that unless these things are 
delivered on the ground, and they can only be delivered on the 
ground by the provinces, (not much will be accomplished). 
That's why I have been fighting all along for the autonomy of 
provinces. 
<H5>  On the Melamet Commission's recommendations: </H5>
  [Buthelezi] From the point of view of our people, black 
people, I would say that they (the salaries) are too high. 
(But) most of the perks are now no longer there. There used to 
be a lot of perks for other Ministers. 
<H5>  On the transfer of land to the Ingonyama Trust: </H5>
  [Buthelezi] The issue that I thought might ruin the 
Government of National Unity [GNU] was this thing of the 
Ingonyama Land Trust. But the way it was handled by President 
Mandela himself, and also by Minister Derek Hanekom and those 
other colleagues who were in that (Cabinet) committee was such 
that, really, I was pleasantly surprised. Because it seemed to 
me that they went out of their way to ensure that it didn't 
ruin the GNU. 
<H5>  On whether IFP structures continue to function: </H5>
  [Buthelezi] There is the issue of local elections, and I 
don't think we should be caught flat-footed if and when that 
comes. So, in fact, when I was addressing a victory rally in 
Umlazi last weekend I stressed that we need to put our 
structures in order. I was very unhappy with our structures. 
<H5>  On mediation: </H5>
  [Buthelezi] Well, there are some very good things in it (the 
Interim Constitution), but I still say it is a flawed 
constitution. And I'm still very concerned that the agreement, 
on the basis of which I went into the election be implemented -- 
that immediately afterwards there should be international 
mediation on the issue of the king and the kingdom. One must 
set that ball rolling because I think that once the 
Constitutional Assembly starts moving it would be impossible to 
then have international mediation. We most definitely still 
want that mediation. 
  I think, for instance, in terms of the RDP, I cannot see 
that 
we can deliver on the ground if we are as centrist as the 
constitution is at present. So, I would really want that 
changed in the constitution. And I was not quite happy with the 
way (legislation on the Constitutional Court was (handled). I 
rally do believe that if we want to deliver, it is really 
essential (that we have true federalism). And I was very 
interested in the meeting that Mr Mandela asked me to attend 
with premiers, because I could see that the very bright people 
who are premiers all over the place want to get on with the job 
with the job to deliver. And that means power. It means 
regional powers. One of them (ANC premiers) even joked with me 
and said: "Why did you fight this issue alone for so long?" 
<H5>  On the election atmosphere: </H5>
  [Buthelezi] In fact, it was a miracle. People queued up 
together, whether they were ANC, IFP, PAC [Pan Africanist 
Congress] or anything, and there was no animosity or anyone 
taunting anyone else. It was extraordinary, and I was 
pleasantly surprised. 
<H5>  On violence levels now: </H5>
  [Buthelezi] Unfortunately, even if the media does not 
highlight it, there is a lot of political killing going on even 
ow. In fact, last weekend one of my first cousins was burying 
his son in Mandeni, and I know of quite a number of people who 
have died since the election, some of them prominent leaders of 
the IFP. 
<H5>  On what can be done to finally eradicate violence: </H5>
  [Buthelezi] I said (in a recent speech) that it is wonderful 
we have got our liberation, but I (also) said there is a dark 
cloud because the state of emergency is still on the 
KwaZulu/Natal, and I resent that very much because I didn't 
think that it should have been imposed. 
<H5>  On whether he has raised the issue with Mandela: </H5>
  [Buthelezi] Let me share with you an informal conversation 
we 
had with him. In Parliament we were standing in the Assembly 
with some of my colleagues, and he came over to our side. One 
of our leaders raised this issue, and he (Mandela) said: "No, 
no, no, that we will discuss with Shenge [Buthelezi's tribal 
name]." He said it was a matter between us. But, of course, I 
don't blame President Mandela that he hasn't (yet) done so. He 
is a very busy person. 
<H5>  On his relationship with Mandela: </H5>
  [Buthelezi] President Mandela has always been very affable. 
I defer to Madiba [Mandela] (because he is older than me). He 
has said things which have hurt me, but I have never responded 
in kind because for me, even before he was President, he is 
still mnewethu [my brother], he is older than me and I respect 
that. In spite of all those things that have hurt me, when we 
are together this warmth surfaces. 
<H5>  On his relationship with F W de Kerk: </H5>
  [Buthelezi] I wouldn't say that we are close, but I think we 
behave towards each other like civilized men, if I may put it 
that way. 
<H5>  On the possibility of a future IFP/NP [National Party] </H5>
alliance: 
  [Buthelezi] Well, I haven't thought of that. The betrayal 
(by De Klerk and his government) came up on issues like 
federation. He and his party say they also believe in a federal 
formula for this country but in terms of delivery, when it came 
to negotiating with the ANC on a trilateral basis, there was no 
evidence of that. And that's what, really, brought about the 
mistrust between us. 
<H5>  On pressure on him to enter the election: </H5>
  [Buthelezi] My good friend, Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl invited 
me to Germany. I have very high regard for Chancellor Kohl, and 
after I had explained my position, he had no problem. But then 
when I went to see his Minister of Foreign Affairs who belongs 
to another party ... it was quite an acrimonious discussion, on 
the basis that he was now seeing me as the fly in the ointment, 
as the person who was blocking things from happening. 
  From there I went to Copenhagen, invited by the Foreign 
Minister there, and it was the same kind of thing. And also my 
last meeting with the Prime Minister of Britain, (John) Major, 
wasn't very cordial. I didn't know him as well as Lady Thatcher 
who really became a friend of mine. But I actually didn't blame 
them myself. I blame the diplomats as a whole. In fact, the 
American ambassador went out of his way to write me a very long 
letter, which personally I wouldn't have thought an ambassador 
should write. 
<H5>  On whether his international relations have improved: </H5>
  [Buthelezi] It is still too early to judge, but there have 
been a number of ambassadors who have come here paying respects 
or just coming to see me in my new capacity. 
<H5>  On whether foreign pressure influenced him: </H5>
  [Buthelezi] No. In fact, whenever there were those 
discussions abroad, I always said to them: you don't have to 
live with it, I have to live with it, which they didn't like 
very much. I said that whereas I don't question the fact that 
they have a right to advise and to help and so on, they are not 
South Africans and in the final analysis I have to live with the 
results of what they were asking me to do. 
<H5>  On when people's standard of living will improve: </H5>
  [Buthelezi] You are asking a very painful question because I 
don't believe that however much we try -- and it's wrong, 
perhaps, for me as a Minister to say so -- but I don't think 
that in terms of the promises of the election and the 
expectations which have arisen as a result of those promises, 
that we can deliver in terms of those promises. I hope it 
doesn't create disillusionment. 
<H5>  On the possibility of an election before 1999: </H5>
  [Buthelezi] I have said that people must prepare for an 
election. If you look in the histories of many countries of 
majority parties, when they cannot deliver sometimes they call 
an election before there is too much disillusionment. 
<H5>  On the IFP's election performance: </H5>
  [Buthelezi] If you look at the vote I had and, of course, if 
you look at the malpractices as well which robbed us of many 
votes, even I was surprised. Not that I didn't know that people 
supported me. It was not even (only) in the so-called Zulu 
areas that I got the vote, but in many parts of South Africa. 
If I had campaigned, It seems that I have a right to say I 
would have done very well. I don't say I would have been 
elected as the government, but I would have done far better if I 
had campaigned. 
<H5>  On allegations of tensions within the IFP: </H5>
  [Buthelezi] It was a figment, really, of the imagination. 
There was no such a thing at all. But I think that there were 
some Members of Parliament that we had inherited that were keen 
to maintain their careers, and they were the ones who were 
feeding this to the press, (probably) to put pressure on me. 
<H5>  On criticism of IFP `hardliners': </H5>
  [Buthelezi] Dr (Mario) Ambrosini even now is very close to 
me, not because he gives me political advice at all, but because 
of his expertise as an international constitutional lawyer. He 
is a very clever and competent person in that field. Mr 
(Walter) Felgate has worked with me for nearly 20 years now. 
This (criticism) of course was also fed to the press by the 
government itself. Also, it is a racist idea that if any white 
person is close to you, then he is your adviser in a sense that 
he is a guru to you. For an old man like myself who has been in 
politics for more than 40 years, to say that either Felgate or 
Ambrosini then became my gurus, really, is laughable to me. 
<H5>  On whether pre-election pressure on him took its toll on his </H5>
health: 
  [Buthelezi] I really don't know. My mother, who died at the 
age of 84, had a very strong constitution. I only say, perhaps, 
I must have inherited my mother's constitution. But many people 
say I am abusing it because of the pace at which I work, and the 
way I work until late at night. I think that the pressure I was 
under was such that I even marvel myself when some of the 
doctors examine me wand say how low my blood pressure is, how 
normal it is. 
<H5>  On people's expectations: </H5>
  [Buthelezi] I can only echo what President Mandela has said. 
Our people, the South African nation, must really understand 
that we do mean to deliver -- even those of us who are not 
members of the ANC. We do mean to co-operate with the ANC in 
the Government to deliver. But even he, President Mandela, has 
said that these things can't be delivered instantly. One must 
warn the nation that in terms of the vast needs, and the extent 
to which the economy itself was damaged by disinvestment and 
other things, people should just be a little patient with us. 
They should not really look to the Government to do it (alone), 
but to the Government to do it with them. I believe the twin 
pillars are self-help and self-reliance.

<F P=106> [Unattibuted editorial] </F>
  [Text] The issue of three ANC cabinet ministers in 
KwaZulu/Natal refusing to attend meetings of the provincial 
Legislative Assembly held in Ulundi gives the impression that 
the ANC is not really committed to peace and reconciliation. 
  We say this because much has already been said by the ANC in 
the short space of time that the issue has come up. Most 
unfortunately its spokesmen are in the habit of using a sharp 
tongue to tackle delicate issues. We do not know if this is 
deliberate, or if it is the result of the hotheadedness of youth. 
  It is not constructive now, and will never be, to speak of 
Ulundi in a manner that even a child can see is not just debate 
on an issue of interest, but that is rather aimed at stirring up 
the cauldron of hate and stubbornly barricading all avenues to 
peace and reconciliation. 
  It is most unfortunate that this is taking place in 
KwaZulu/Natal, a province that lags so far behind others in 
development and needs a new provincial government dedicated 
above all to redressing the situation. The ANC must learn that, 
as the Zulu saying goes, "Don't spit into the wind". We know 
how hard it is for the ANC to swallow all those terrible things 
it said about Ulundi before the election, and that is why it is 
fighting so hard to ensure that Ulundi does not become the 
provincial capital. 
  We admonish the ANC not to be one-sided in such issues. We 
also urge it to accept the fact of its defeat in the provincial 
elections, because we believe that its problems stem from its 
attempts to mentally block out this one fact. It must realize 
that the contribution needed in our region is not its ability to 
hurl abuse, slander, and disparaging remarks whenever it does 
not get its way, but that the spirit of peace and reconciliation 
be nurtured.

  [Text] Durban June 22 SAPA -- While the state of emergency 
in KwaZulu/Natal has lapsed legally, police in the region say it 
still stands, and the national cabinet has yet to decide on 
whether it will be maintained or not. The South African 
National Defence Force, at a media briefing in Durban on 
Wednesday [22 June], said while the security legislation lapsed 
21 days after the new government came to power, the emergency 
had not been lifted. 
  A SANDF spokesman said the implication was that soldiers no 
longer had such wide powers to search and seize. 
  But South African Police Services spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo 
said as far as he was concerned the emergency had not been 
lifted and was still in place. 
  At the end of May, National Defence and Safety and Security 
Ministers Joe Modise and Sidney Mufamadi met KwaZulu/Natal army 
and police chiefs to discuss violence. They promised to make 
recommendations to the cabinet on the continuance of the 
emergency. 
  Safety and security spokesman Craig Kotze said on Wednesday 
certain recommendations had been made to the cabinet which still 
had to make a decision on the issue. When the legislation 
lapsed the Human Rights Committee [HRC] opposed any 
re-enactment, saying it was unconstitutional and appeared 
unnecessary because political violence levels in the province 
had dropped. 
  The HRC said there were also no more detainees under the 
emergency, another reason for it not to be continued. The HRC 
and other human rights watchdogs are afraid police will abuse 
the vast powers they enjoy under the emergency. 
  However, both the HRC and regional peace committee say they 
are in favour of continued troop deployment to deter violence.

  [Text] Parliament June 22 SAPA -- The Senate is to have 11 
standing committees for government portfolios, with 11 senators 
on each committee. This was decided on Wednesday [22 June] by 
the senate rules committee. 
  President of the Senate, Mr Kobie Coetsee, asked the parties 
to submit their members' names to the parliamentary secretariat 
by noon on Thursday. He said experience would guide whether the 
grouping of the portfolios needed to be changed in future. 
  Secretary to Parliament Mr Robin Douglas pointed out that 
according to a press statement by the speaker, debate on 
legislation was due to start next week. 
  The African National Congress is to have six senators on 
each 
committee, the National Party two and the Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP], Freedom Front and Democratic Party one each. 
  Three house committees are also to be formed to deal with 
internal parliamentary arrangements, the library and catering 
facilities. 
  Following complaints from Senator Naren Singh (IFP) about 
"untenable" office accommodation for his party, the committee 
resolved the matter would be addressed urgently by a delegation 
led by ANC chief whip Senator Bulelani Ngcuka. 
  The committee concurred with a decision of the National 
Assembly's rules committee earlier this week that France's 
President Francois Mitterrand be formally invited to address a 
joint meeting of both houses during his state visit to South 
Africa next month. 
  The address is to take place on Monday, July 4, at 11.30AM.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Fair Balance -- "Keys well-balanced Budget should allay a 
lot 
of economic jitters, at home and abroad, while offering a sound 
basis of hope to the deprived. As in the old South Africa, the 
acid test is whether government spending will be kept firgly in 
check," states an editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English 
on 23 June on page 18. The "good news" is that Reconstruction 
and Development Program "is to be financed largely through cuts 
in existing allocations," with no increase in VAT [value-added 
tax] or fuel tax. As for the "widely expected soaking of the 
rich," this takes the form of a "one-off 5 percent tax surcharge 
on individuals and companies with taxable incme over R50,000 
[rand] a year." As "redistribution" had to come, this "is not a 
bad way to approach it." "The Budget's stress on increased 
social spending sends the correct signals to a society in need 
of radical reconstruction," and while much "remains for the 
present in the realm of promise rather than performance, but at 
least the guidelines are firmly set out." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  PWV, KwaZulu/Natal Capitals -- The decision to make 
Johannesburg the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] 
capital "was much easier than resolving a similiar issue in 
KwaZulu/Natal" as "the political dilemna is not as tense," notes 
an editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 23 June on 
page 10. "If a suitable resolution -- the decision has now been 
taken to the people for a referendum -- is arrived at, the 
fundamental political problems of that region might also be 
resolved. For stated simply, it is a political fight for control 
between the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], which runs the region, 
and the ANC which believes it should be running it." 
<H8>  BEELD </H8>
  Television Tax -- "SABC [South African Broadcasting 
Corporation] proposing that part of its income should come from 
increased taxes can bring to an end its license problem." 
Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 17 June says in a page 10 
editorial. "It creates an opportunity to ease the bigger 
problems experienced by the SABC, even though taxpayers could 
resist payment of licenses." "The plan is that a percentage of 
the state's income tax should replace the license fees. This is 
a much more efficient manner of collecting money than the 
expensive and ineffective effort to get television viewers to 
pay license fees every year." "However, the disadvantages of 
this system is that people who do not watch television would 
also be taxed, and that taxpayers could regard such a system as 
being unfair. It could also further undermine the SABC's 
Independence." "As a state-run corporation it enjoys much more 
advantages than the private media. In certain respects it has 
the monopoly, namely, television news programs during the peak 
period, and choice advertising." "The taxation plan provides 
the state with an opportunity to make the SABC less dependent on 
advertisements. It would be practically easier collecting 
increased tax than increasing license fees." "Although 
television tax will ultimately have several advantages, the 
matter should nevertheless be approached very cautiously."

  [Text] It looks as if yet another armed faction has 
surfaced in Liberia, this time in the southeast, where there 
have been ongoing clashes between Charles Taylor's NPFL 
[National Patriotic Front of Liberia] and the Liberian Peace 
Council, LPC. The emergence of the new group is being linked to 
insecurity on the main road into the port city of Buchanan. 
From Monrovia, Nii Nartey Allison telexed this report: 
  Today, ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States 
Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] said it had arrested four rebels it 
said were responsible for an ambush last Thursday [16 June] on a 
car on the Buchanan Highway. Two people were killed in the 
attack and five wounded. The ECOMOG chief of operations, 
Colonel Albert Lamptey, told reporters that posters and 
identification papers found with the four rebels carried the 
insignia of the Bassa Defense Force, BDF, a previously unknown 
armed group. He said the posters called for the withdrawal of 
the Nigerian contingent from ECOMOG. 
  ECOMOG's chief of staff, General Femi Williams [title as 
heard], said the four ambush suspects were still being 
investigated, and warned factions against launching ambushes on 
the highway to Buchanan. Gen. Williams said rebels of Charles 
Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia, NPFL, have moved 
into positions occupied by ECOMOG, adding: These provocations 
are still continuing to force us into battle. 
  Meanwhile, Monrovia is still puzzled over a search operation 
carried out on Monday morning by the African troops, paralyzing 
the entire commercial sector of the city. General Kunle Togun 
of the Nigerian contingent said the search was carried out to 
uncover weapons that may have been smuggled into the city.

  [Text] Monrovia, 22 Jun (AFP) -- Rebels of Charles Taylor's 
National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) attacked soldiers of 
a rival armed group in Louisville before dawn Tuesday [21 June], 
a minister in Liberia's transitional government said here 
Wednesday. 
  Assistant Defense Minister Arthur Dennis said "about 200 
NPFL 
fighters attacked positions of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) 
in Louisville," some 20 kilometers from the port city of 
Buchanan, 90 kilometers (60 miles) south-east of Monrovia. 
  One AFL soldier was "seriously wounded" in the attack, and 
is 
presently receiving treatment at a military clinic, the minister 
said, but he gave no casualty figure for the NPFL. 
  Since the peace accord signed at Cotonou in Benin in July 
1993, no fighting has been reported until now between any of the 
three signatories (AFL, NPFL and United Movement of Liberation - 
ULIMO). 
  Dennis said the situation was now under control, adding that 
everything was being done "to pursue the NPFL fighters to a 
reasonable distance in order to avoid a recurrence of the 
incident." 
  The attack has been reported to the ECOMOG African 
peacekeeping forces and the UN Observer Mission in Liberia 
(UNOMIL), the minister said. 
  The Defense Ministry also said it had received reports that 
a 
3,000-strong party from the neighbouring state of Burkina Faso 
had crossed via Ivory Coast into Gbarnga, the NPFL headquarter 
town 160 kilometers (100 miles) north-east of Monrovia. Dennis 
claimed this was part of plans by Taylor for a new offensive. 
  "Taylor has instructed his men to blast all bridges along 
the 
Monrovia-Buchanan highway," the minister quoted the report as 
saying. 
  NPFL-controlled radio in Gbarnga said Sunday Taylor has 
ordered NPFL fighters to take positions on a highway to 
Buchanan, 90 kilometers (60 miles) south-east of Monrovia, to 
prevent the rival armed Liberia Peace Council (LPC) transporting 
arms to its men. 
  In another incident, fighting was also reported to have 
broken out before dawn Tuesday between factions from the rival 
Mandingo and Krahn clans within the armed United Liberation 
Movement (ULIMO) near a displaced camp in Brewerville, 20 
kilometers (12 miles) north-west of Monrovia. Witnesses said 
Mandingo fighters loyal to Alhaji Kromah attacked rival Krahn 
militia of General Roosevelt Johnson [and] took over the area 
following few hours of fighting.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] There is apparently no end to the fighting in 
Liberia. Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of 
Liberia] seems to be involved in at least two conflicts that 
continue to endanger any efforts to establish peace and hold 
general elections in Liberia. Taylor claims he keeps getting 
attacked by the Liberian Peace Council [LPC] in the southeast. 
At the same time, the Armed Forces of Liberia, AFL, are 
frequently involved in battles with the NPFL. The latest seems 
to be control for the approaches to the port of Buchanan. From 
Monrovia, Nii Nartey Allison telexed this report: 
  United Nations officials say the fighting started yesterday, 
and that by this morning the NPFL had taken control of a section 
of the Buchanan Highway around the Bible Industrial Academy. 
According to ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States 
Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], the highway is now closed to 
civilian traffic. AFL defense spokesman Arthur Dennis says the 
current round of fighting has broken out because Charles Taylor 
has ordered his NPFL fighters to blow up all bridges on the 
Buchanan Highway. Dennis claimed the NPFL had been beaten back 
and he warned: Any further attacks on the AFL will force us to 
pursue the NPFL all the way to their headquarters at Gbarnga. 
Meanwhile, NPFL radio says Charles Taylor has ordered his 
fighters to take up positions on the Buchanan Highway to prevent 
the Liberian Peace Council from using this road to transport 
weapons to its fighters. 
  Well, it is not only Charles Taylor who complains about the 
activities of the LPC, who are not signatories of the Cotonou 
Accord. Taylor claims the Nigerian contingent in ECOMOG is 
supplying the LPC with arms. The human rights organizations are 
unhappy with LPC's operations, and the United Nations' 
representative, Trevor Gordon-Somers, last week expressed 
concern about the LPC. Well, the LPC's chairman, (George 
Boley), called us up and Robin White asked him what he made of 
the allegations against the LPC. 
  [Begin recording] [(Boley)] Robin, let me make one thing 
very clear. First of all, we have never received any supply of 
arms and ammunition from ECOMOG, particularly not the Nigerian 
ECOMOG. These are fabrications that are, you know, calculated to 
destroy the reputation of ECOMOG. We made it clear: Many of 
the weapons we capture are captured from the NPFL. They are our 
main supply of arms and ammunition, seriously. 
  [White] But, it is not just Charles Taylor who is making 
this accusation. Human rights groups are saying the same. 
  [(Boley)] Those human rights groups, Robin, that are making 
these claims, don't know what they are talking about. When the 
lady came, the Gail Fleischman -- whatever she is -- came to 
Buchanan, she never ventured beyond LPC lines. 
  [White] But, even Mr. Gordon-Somers, a special UN 
representative, he has expressed concern about your activities. 
  [(Boley)] Mr. Gordon-Somers is someone who does not know 
precisely what he is doing in Liberia. Let me repeat, Mr. 
Gordon-Somers is somebody who, by my judgment and perhaps the 
judgment of many other Liberians, typically does not even know 
the geography of this country, let alone what his mission is in 
Liberia. 
  [White] So, you are, what, saying he is lying or just 
ignorant? 
  [(Boley)] I think it is both. 
  [White] Have you been to see him? 
  [(Boley)] I have met Mr. Gordon Somers. 
  [White] And, what happened? 
  [(Boley)] Mr. Gordon Somers, as I said, does not seem to 
know what he is doing. The man continues to be a part of a 
propaganda machine against the LPC. We have informed Mr. 
Gordon-Somers on many occasions what we are, and Mr. 
Gordon-Somers continues to tell the world that the LPC continues 
to attack the NPFL, which is not true. 
  [White] A lot of people wonder, Mr. (Boley), now, how come 
it is that you have so suddenly sprung up and that you are so 
well armed? 
  [(Boley)] Look, I have said to you.... [pauses] Let me put 
this issue to rest once and for all, we have never received any 
consignment of weapons from ECOMOG, generally, and from the 
Nigerian ECOMOG, particularly. We are as armed as the NPFL. I 
have told you, Mr. Taylor has been the major supply of our arms 
and ammunition -- we captured his weapons in Greenville, Sinoe 
County, we captured his arsenal in (Olak) -- and every other 
place we have gone, NPFL is going to run, and NPFL has been our 
major supplier. Yes, there is an embargo. How does Mr. Taylor 
continue to get weapons even today? He cannot point any accusing 
finger at anybody because he brought the arms in, we are simply 
recipients of what he has brought into the country. [end

  [Text] Paris, 23 Jun (AFP) -- The Government of Niger and 
Tuareg rebels tentatively agreed here Wednesday [22 June] to 
create "homogeneous" autonomous regions for the country's ethnic 
groups, each with its own elected assembly and governor. 
  Mano Dayak, leader of the Tuareg delegation to peace talks 
mediated by France and Algeria, said the two sides had reached 
agreement "in principle" on most key issues. He said the plan 
was to carve out a new administrative map from the present 
French-style departments taking account of "cultural and social 
homogeneity". 
  Dayak said the two sides "agreed in principle on a fully 
autonomous administration for these regions with elected 
assemblies and governors to be appointed by them, parallel with 
the central government structures." 
  The talks which have been under way for more than a week at 
a 
secret location outside Paris were between the government 
represented by Mai Maigana, high commissioner for the 
restoration of peace, and the Armed Resistance Coordination 
(CRA) comprising Niger's four Tuareg rebel organisations. 
  Dayak said the CRA had argued for "a return to peace and 
reinsertion of ex-combatants with some being absorbed into the 
(national) Army." But he said there were "too many differences" 
and the government would be having more consultations in Niamey 
before a new round of talks in Algiers. 
  The CRA has long sought the right to be able to run its own 
affairs in an area reserved for Niger's estimated 750,000 
Tuaregs, who account for 10 percent of the population. It has 
also called for a quota system guaranteeing Tuaregs a fair share 
of jobs in government institutions and the armed forces. The 
Tuaregs concentrated in northern Niger have been fighting the 
central governments of Mali and Niger for several years. The 
rebellion recently appeared to have spread to Burkina Faso which 
has taken in thousands of Tuareg refugees.

  [Text] Lagos, 22 Jun (AFP) -- Nigerian opposition leader 
Moshood Abiola, sought by security forces since June 11, on 
Wednesday defied the military regime by making a public address 
to more than 2,000 people in the heart of the capital. Abiola 
supporters went wild when the Muslim millionaire tycoon, missing 
since he slipped away under the nose of police earlier this 
month while under house arrest, suddenly surfaced in Lagos. He 
proclaimed himself president and Armed Forces commander-in-chief 
on June 11, saying he was the legitimate winner of the June 12, 
1993, presidential elections later cancelled by the military 
authorities.

  [Text] Nigeria's Chief Moshood Abiola says he is under 
arrest this morning. It appears that he was arrested late last 
night after making a surprise appearance in front of a crowd in 
Lagos yesterday afternoon. That was the first time that he had 
been seen in public since he proclaimed himself president on the 
first anniversary of the annulled 12 June election, which he was 
widely believed to have won. Well, after his proclamation the 
military government offered an award for his arrest and the 
chief went into hiding. As he was being arrested, Chief Abiola 
spoke on his mobile phone to James Sacks who asked where he was: 
  [Begin recording] [Abiola] I am speaking from my car. I am 
being taken to detention. 
  [Sacks] So, where are you being taken to? 
  [Abiola] I understand to Anegbor Close, the detention 
center. 
  [Sacks] And have you been told what exactly you are being 
charged with? 
  [Abiola] They said I have been charged with felony or 
allegation of felony, namely treason. 
  [Sacks] Having spoken to the rally in Lagos last night, is 
this what you were expecting to happen? 
  [Abiola] In Nigeria, even the most unexpected can happen. 
There is no [word indistinct]. [laughs] These things are not as 
bad as they sound. 
  [Sacks] So, now that you are on your way to the police 
station what are your feelings? Are you in any way changing 
your mind about your position? 
  [Abiola] Absolutely not! Absolutely not! I have the 
overwhelming mandate of the Nigerian people to be the president 
and commander in chief. Even Sani Abacha confessed that two 
days ago on television. He said injustice was done by the 
annulment, yet he did not want to correct the injustice. 
Instead, [laughs] his way of correcting this injustice is 
charging me with treason, whereas it is he himself who is 
leading an illegal authority over Nigeria by force of arms. 
  [Sacks] Now, you are on your way to prison at the moment. Do 
you think that you are going to be less trouble or more trouble 
to the military administration behind bars? 
  [Abiola] No it is not, you see.... [pauses] I am not any 
trouble or anything. It is the people.... [pauses] This new 
government is against the people, and they cannot win. They are 
taking me in as the symbol of the people's mandate. The people 
are not going to watch and let an individual override the 
sovereign wish of the Nigerian people. He is about to find out 
how truly important he really is. Just wait and see. I don't 
want to say anymore. Thank you very much. [end recording]

  [Text] The Nigerian police has accomplished a major feat by 
finally tracking down Chief Moshood Abiola who allegedly 
declared himself president of Nigeria about a couple of weeks 
ago. It will be recalled that Chief Abiola, the presidential 
candidate of the defunct Social Democratic Party, was declared 
wanted about two weeks ago by the police to answer a charge of 
treason leveled against him following his self-declaration as 
president of Nigeria. The deputy inspector general of police in 
charge of operations, Mr. Nuhu Aliyu, confirmed the arrest in an 
interview a few hours ago with Mohammed Okoresho. 
  [Begin recording] [Aliyu] The arrest is no longer a rumor; 
it 
is confirmed, yes. We are very positive. 
  [Okoresho] Now, how did it happen? Did he surrender himself 
or he appeared as reported in some of the media, or you sought 
him out? 
  [Aliyu] He did not surrender himself. He appeared, and we 
were very cautious but eventually we arrested him. 
  [Okoresho] Now, before his appearance in public, did you get 
a tipoff of his hideout or that he was going to appear in public? 
  [Aliyu] Yes, yes, yes we got a tipoff that he was appearing. 
  [Okoresho] Now, how come, according to press reports, that 
he 
was able to address a rally and drive through the traffic all 
the way to his own house until he was picked up much later? 
  [Aliyu] It's a strategy; I do not want to explain further. 
  [Okoresho] A foreign radio has been relaying an interview 
with Chief Moshood Abiola while supposedly being taken away by 
his captors. Are people under arrest normally allowed to do 
that kind of interview? It does not seem like a police style to 
me. 
  [Aliyu] Normally, somebody who.... [pauses] whoever is under 
arrest is not supposed to grant any interview. It's very 
unusual. We are looking into this report. 
  [Okoresho] What are going to do with Chief Abiola now? Where 
is he right now? 
  [Aliyu] Chief Abiola? 
  [Okoresho] Yes. 
  [Aliyu] Of course, he is going to be interrogated. You know, 
after accusation he has to sit down with us, we interrogate him. 
He will have to make a statement to us. [end recording]

  [Text] Members of the Armed Forces have again been advised 
to resist attempts by disgruntled elements to cause disaffection 
and discontent in the society. Addressing a combined parade of 
Army, Air Force, and the police in Kaduna, the head of state, 
General Sani Abacha, said some misguided citizens have been 
going round barracks and military formations trying to create 
confusion. He pointed out that such people were using religious 
and tribal sentiments in an attempt to discomfort members of the 
Armed Forces. 
  The head of state, therefore, reminded members of the Armed 
Forces of their responsibility to ensure peace and stability of 
the country. Gen. Abacha then warned the soldiers to shun any 
mischievous characters manifesting themselves as politicians and 
self-proclaimed democrats. He drew their attention to the fact 
that in the event of any crisis, the soldiers would be the first 
victims. The commander in chief assured them that government was 
fully aware of the sacrifices they were making to keep the 
country together. He however warned that the present 
administration would not submit to blackmail from certain 
quarters in subverting the cause of the democratic process being 
implemented by government. 
  On the economy, Gen. Abacha acknowledged that the country 
was 
passing through a difficult period but assured that the 
government would fully implement the measures announced in this 
year's budget to bring relief.

commended the present administration for making the restoration 
of democracy in the country its priority. He was speaking while 
receiving the head of state, General Sani Abacha, at his palace.

  [Text] The Federal Government says no amount of pressure, 
internal threat, or external intimidation will force it to take 
measures that are likely to create anarchy in the country. The 
secretary to the government of the federation, Alhaji Aminu 
Saleh, stated this in Abuja last night at a reception for media 
executives. He said government was determined to put in place a 
genuine democratic government as soon as possible. 
  Alhaji Aminu advised some foreign powers against sponsoring 
terrorism and disorder in the country. He said no country 
should be allowed to impose its political ideas on the country 
since Nigeria has never imposed its ideas on any other country. 
The secretary to the government said the Constitutional 
Conference was at present the only legally constituted body to 
carry out the assignment on behalf of the people of this 
country. He said government would continue to rely on the mass 
media for an objective assessment of economic policies.

  [Text] The Council of Ministers met at the Futungo de Belas 
in Luanda today. In addition to a report on the political and 
military situation and the ongoing Lusaka talks, the meeting 
approved a number of documents. The session was chaired by 
President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos. According to 
Council of Ministers Secretary Carlos Feijo, the General State 
Budget was readjusted. 
  [Begin Feijo recording] The priorities of the General State 
Budget are still the same: defense, public order, health, 
education, and social welfare. The adjustment proposal calls 
for higher allotments to those items. 
  The Council of Ministers also approved a draft law on the 
exemption of customs duties on basic commodities like rice, 
sugar, beans, soap, medicines, and frozen meat. It is now up to 
the National Assembly to ratify the law. [end recording] 
  The law also exempts from customs duties and stamp revenues 
the importation of raw materials, equipment, and spare parts for 
Angolan industry. 
  [Begin Feijo recording] The session also approved the law 
granting mining rights to the National Angolan Fuel Company 
[Sonangol] over Block 15. Sonangol has been allowed to join a 
(?consortium) to operate in that block. The consortium, which 
includes Exxon, British Petroleum, (Statol), and Agip, will 
invest over $100 million in research operations over the next 
four years. Block 15 is the third deep water block the 
government has allocated to Sonangol. It is situated in [name 
indistinct] bay. 
  The session was briefed on the ongoing drafting of the law 
on 
public enterprises. Basically, the law aims at changing the 
organization of such state enterprises and transforming them 
into public enterprises. [end recording]

  [Text] The clashes are still on in the country. The city

Savimbi's troops are suffering heavy losses on the ground. Our 
correspondent Abel Abraao reports: 
  [Abraao] Kuito is still under intense shelling. While 
Jonas Savimbi's rebel organization continues shelling the 
defenseless residents, in the military field they are suffering 
heavy losses because the government forces have had enough of 
the provocations of National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] bandits. This was revealed to our 
news desk by Brigadier Damiano Mocume, second commander of the 
Angolan Armed Forces [FAA] regional command in Bie. 
Brigadier Mocume told Radio Nacional de Angola that over the 
past few hours the FAA intercepted and destroyed four vehicles 
carrying war materiel south of the city of Kuito. In Cuche 
commune, the FAA detachment was attacked but gave a lesson to 
Jonas Savimbi's soldiers, killing seven rebels and capturing 
[words indistinct] five 81-mm mortars with shells. 
  In Ganda District, Benguela Province, UNITA troops yesterday 
burned more than a dozen trucks belon+ging to the World Food 
Program, WFP, carrying food aid. Our correspondent Celestino 
Matos reports: 
  [Matos] More than a dozen WFP trucks were attacked and 
burned by UNITA forces when carrying food aid for Culango 
residents. The attack took place in the Lobito-Culango road, 
where the vehicles were carrying basic commodities for residents 
of that area who face acute food shortages. The extent of the 
damages caused to the convoy, which was unarmed, is not yet 
known. The WFP in Benguela has not yet reacted to the UNITA 
attack. 
  Lunda Norte Provincial Governor Moises Nele has described 
the 
situation as worrisome in his province, taking into account the 
increase in UNITA operations. Our correspondent reports: 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Lunda Norte Provincial 
Governor Moises Nele today described as worrisome the political 
and military situation in his jurisdiction. Nele, who is 
attending the third Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola [MPLA] regional meeting in Saurimo made his 
statements, in response to UNITA operations on the road linking 
Dundo to the diamond areas of Lusage and Lucapa. That official 
accused Zaire of involvement in the Angolan conflict.

Angola] has stepped up its shelling of the city of Kuito and 
outlaying areas. Several people have either been killed or 
wounded. Clashes between government and UNITA troops have also 
been reported. The situation has been worsened by an 
unprecedented shortage of food. An average of 10 people starve 
to death in Kuito daily. Thousands of undernourished people 
could have the same fate in the next few days unless relief 
operations resume. 
  Meanwhile, UNITA continues to move men, including Zairian 
mercenaries, and war materiel to mount a large-scale offensive 
on the city of N'dalatando over the next few hours. Lieutenant 
General Manuel Jose Neco, commander of the Cuanza Norte 
Operational Area, says government forces continue to defend the 
city. UNITA's long-range artillery units are still shelling the 
city. Government forces have killed eight UNITA soldiers and 
captured assorted war materiel. Captured UNITA soldiers 
disclosed that Jonas Savimbi instructed Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola commando units from Huambo to retake the 
city of N'dalatando before the end of the month to further 
complicate the Lusaka peace talks.

<F P=106> [Article by Fernando Veloso and Orlando Muchanga] </F>
  [Excerpts] (Beira)--Afonso Dhlakama, leader of Renamo 
[Mozambique National Resistance], is in Beira. He told MEDIAFAX 
yesterday that he was received by "a large crowd of over 50,000 
people." Independent sources, and others linked to Frelimo 
[Mozambique Liberation Front], without risking giving numbers, 
noted that the reception was "in fact unusual." A Mozambique 
Television journalist commented that "undoubtedly there were 
many more people than those who went to receive Chissano." Yet, 
a Radio Mozambique journalist estimated the number of people who 
went to the airport as 10,000. The same journalist told us that 
at the traditional reception ceremony, in which Dhlakama was 
dressed in a leopard skin, five local traditional chiefs 
attended the event. 
  Commenting on the reception given to Dhlakama, who is 
visiting Beira after a 16-year absence, the sources recognized 
that the security forces were not efficient. "Renamo guards 
even beat up a number of people who could not control their 
desire to see Dhlakama." A journalist commented that the 
government police were apathetic. 
  The level of absenteeism in the companies was enormous. Our 
sources say that this explains why so many people went to 
welcome Dhlakama on a normal working day, although workers were 
not given a day off when Joaquim Chissano arrived in Beira on a 
visit in his capacity as president of the Republic. [passage 
omitted] 
  Commenting on the "passive" attitude of the government 
police 
during the Renamo chairman's arrival in Beira, the Sofala 
Provincial governor said that this happened because "the 
coordination with Renamo was difficult" on security measures. 
  He added: "I do not yet know exactly what happened, but it 
was nothing serious." 
  On several occasions, we asked the Renamo leader and the 
Sofala governor about the controversial issue of woodcutters. 
  Dhlakama says he has no planned meeting with the woodcutters 
"in particular," but with businessmen "in general." 
  The concern of the woodcutters, who are unable to continue 
their activities, has emerged again. Dhlakama began by saying 
that he is "very angry with MEDIAFAX" for not having precisely 
reproduced his ideas in our newspaper recently. He said we 
"misinformed" people when we reported that he said he would give 
priority to U.S. nationals in detriment to Mozambican citizens. 
  He said: "I met with U.S. businessmen from several sectors, 
but I do not know whether there were woodcutters among them." 
  On this issue, concerning Renamo priorities, Dhlakama 
explained that "there is a policy for the woodcutters, be they 
Mozambicans or foreigners. When they cut wood they must plant 
seedlings, otherwise two years from now we will have no trees." 
  We asked him what criteria would be followed to identify the 
Mozambican woodcutters. 
  Dhlakama said: "We have always said that they can cut the 
wood, but with the following conditions: cut one tree and plant 
another one. We know that the Mozambican businessmen do not 
have these facilities because the state does not grant them 
loans and they cannot work just with an axe, a saw, or a hoe." 
  But there are businessmen who have the financial resources 
for that and complain that they are not allowed work. Dhlakama 
replied: "No, there are no such businessmen!" 
  He added: "We understand that the wood cutters want to earn 
money, they want to prosper, they also want to pay their workers 
because they are living in difficult conditions. We know that, 
but it is better to think about the future of our children and 
grandchildren." 
  We asked whether Renamo recognizes licenses issued by the 
government, with whom it signed the Peace Accord. He said: "You 
should know that the Frelimo government is corrupt," and added, 
"in Mozambique a number of licenses have been issued to 
foreigners through corruption which does not benefit the 
Mozambican people in any way." 
  He also said that it is not a matter of Renamo recognizing 
the licenses or persisting in having a dual administration. The 
issue is, although Renamo "is an opposition party and recognizes 
the government, we do not accept the fact that the government 
continues with its corrupt actions and the populations remains 
without land because it is offered to foreigners, and the 
dollars go to the ministers' pockets." 
  Sofala Provincial Governor Francisco Masquil says he does 
not 
know whether Renamo authorizes the woodcutters to work in areas 
under its control, but would like the problem to be solved "as 
soon as possible." 
  We asked Masquil whether Frelimo was becoming alarmed about 
the Renamo leader's visit to Sofala and he said: "This is not 
our concern at present," adding that "we are currently concerned 
about peace." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Government soldiers of the 3d Commando Battalion 
stationed in Bobole, 40 km north of the city of Maputo, have 
erected barricades on national highway No. 1 at 2000 on 21 June, 
preventing the free movement of people and goods. We received 
that information this morning from Maximo Dias, secretary 
general of the Mozambican Nationalist Movement. He was in the 
area while traveling to Bilene, Gaza Province. 
  [Begin recording] [Dias] Feelings are running high. People 
are very nervous. A senior army officer who arrived there at 
2100 was dragged by the soldiers who detained him. His vehicle 
was impounded and the driver assaulted. The situation is 
serious and the residents are traumatized. A solution ought to 
be found at once. It appears that the situation can be resolved 
easily. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What are the troops demanding? 
  [Dias] They want to meet senior officers to discuss their 
immediate demobilization. They have also asked for the UN 
Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] to intervene, but I told them 
Unomoz had no jurisdiction over the matter. I said the matter 
can be dealt with by our armed forces. 
  We have a defense minister and the commander in chief who is 
the president of the Republic. I would like to urge them to 
take immediate action so that the residents are not subject to 
this type of behavior. Whenever salaries are not paid, troops 
barricade roads and begin shooting. Though nervous, the 
soldiers said they did not want to harass travelers. They have 
harmed no one. They merely want to go back home. They have 
families to support. They noted that their pay, food, and 
shelter are not adequate. [end recording] 
  A Defense Ministry source says measures have been taken to 
resolve the matter. The source declined to elaborate, alleging 
that it was a military matter. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] In northern Nampula Province, Islam has been 
experiencing an unprecedented crisis over the past few years. 
It is now clear that there is division among its followers. 
There are three leading sects -- namely, the Mozambique Islamic 
Congress, the Mozambique Islamic Council, and the Muhammadan 
Association (Sunni sect). [passage omitted] 
  Leading Islamic figures in the Isle of Mozambique and in the 
port city of Nacala say: "We are being invaded by Islamic 
fundamentalism. The whole world knows the signs of it, notably 
those relating to radicalism which leads to violence." 
  They made an accusation: "It is the Sudanese who have been 
introducing Islamic fundamentalism here in Nacala and in the 
Isle of Mozambique..." 
  We asked [Mozambique Islamic Council member] Habibo Amade 
for 
an explanation. 
  He said: "As a matter of fact the danger lies in that 
interpretation because it has been fabricated in the West. We 
ought to be very careful and realize that right now, in line 
with what has been reported in the Western press, Islam is 
regarded in the West as more dangerous because communism is no 
longer around. So, there will be new fabrications and subtly 
they will try to infiltrate us." 
  "Why would the West be so interested in, so to speak, 
overthrowing or even weakening Islam?" 
  "The example from Bosnia is more than clear about that. Now 
that there is an arms embargo, the West is doing its best to 
prevent those people from defending themselves because they do 
not want the establishment of an Islamic state in that part of 
the world. They say it is a violent society and make other 
accusations like the ones about Iran, Algeria, and other Islamic 
countries." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] An explosive situation exists in eastern Caprivi 
after details surfaced of an incident involving a strange armed 
force supported by an attack helicopter of unknown origin, which 
apparently attempted to terrorize the Mafwe chief at Linyanti. 
The household of Chief Bonniface Mamili, on the banks of the 
Linyanti River, which forms the border between Namibia and 
Botswana, was allegedly held captive for several hours by armed 
men combing the surrounding areas in search of members of the 
Angolan resistance movement, UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola], while a helicopter equipped with 
weapons circled over the tribal settlement. The president of 
the DTA [Democratic Turnhalle Alliance] in Namibia, Mr. Mishake 
Muyongo, who is presently visiting the eastern Caprivi, 
yesterday described the incident as sufficient proof of SWAPO's 
[South-West African People's Organization] secret missions to 
intimidate political opponents and to fuel chaos in Caprivi 
where SWAPO currently enjoys no political support. 
  Yesterday the Namibian police strongly denied any 
allegations 
of police and army involvement in the alleged incident and 
confirmed that the incident is being investigated at the highest 
level. According to government sources, Minister of Home Affairs 
Lucas Pohamba and Police Inspector General General Raonga Andima 
was kept fully informed yesterday about developments during the 
joint investigation by police, the Intelligence Service, and the 
Defense Force. Yesterday DIE REPUBLIKEIN could not succeed in 
independently confirming the incident but inhabitants and 
community leaders in Katima Mulilo suggested that members of the 
Botswana Defense Force stationed at the Chobe National Park, or 
even a reconnaissance and fighter unit of the MPLA [Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola] army in Angola, could be 
responsible for the incident. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Muyongo said that according to preliminary information 
at 
his disposal, a secret informant of SWAPO notified the police at 
Katima Mulilo that members of UNITA were hiding in the vicinity 
of the chief's residence. In reaction to this information a 
helicopter and at least three land cruiser vehicles full of 
armed "policemen" were sent to the town. The men in the 
vehicles searched the bush around Mr. Mamili's residence in 
military formation after a helicopter circled the house. After 
the unsuccessful search they disappeared and nothing was heard 
from them since. [passage omitted] 
  Inhabitants of Katima Mulilo said yesterday that the 
Botswana 
Air Force operating from the Kasane Airport near Linyanti often 
violates Namibian borders and that these violations are usually 
accompanied by patrols into Caprivi from the Chobe Nature 
Reserve. According to these inhabitants, high-level talks 
recently took place between senior officers of the Namibian 
Police, the Defense Force, and Intelligence, with their 
counterparts from Botswana. The assistant to the secretary 
general of the police, General Martin Pool, yesterday confirmed 
these talks, adding that the group of officers made use of a 
Botswana Air Force helicopter in their investigation. He 
strongly denied, however, that the helicopter entered Namibian 
airspace. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Address by Finance Minister Derek Keys at Parliament House </F>
in Cape Town -- live; italicized passages in Afrikaans] 
  [Text] Madam Speaker, it's my duty and privilege to present 
to this house and to the nation the proposals of the government 
of national unity for the budget for the year ending 31 March 
1995. These proposals have been formulated against the 
background of a sound fiscal performance in the previous year. 
The deficit was virtually as budgeted, and in the knowledge 
that a continuation of the general structure of taxation set in 
place last year puts progressive reduction of the budget deficit 
in the future within our reach. [sentence as heard] 
  For this to come to pass, however, continued control of the 
level of expenditure is vital. Consequently the government has 
taken particular care in deciding on the treatment of two 
issues, which are germane in this respect -- namely, funding to 
spearhead the Reconstruction and Development Program, and the 
treatment of the costs of our transition to democracy. 
  The president's first words to his cabinet emphasized the 
overriding importance of reconstruction and development in the 
work and life of this government, and in his opening address in 
this house he reinforced this. All members of the cabinet 
responded to this message and its challenge. This challenge as 
we now conceive it is much more comprehensive than any 
particular suite of projects and consists of nothing less than 
focussing the nation's efforts on properly meeting the needs and 
aspirations of all its people. Some of these needs are simple 
-- shelter and the basic elements of hygiene. Some are more 
complex -- an education that will allow its subjects to 
contribute for a lifetime in this modern technological world. 
Many are more complex still -- arranging our society in a way 
that offers everyone the greatest freedom of choice and the 
enjoyment of personal liberty. 
  Every part of our society, every citizen, has a role to play 
in this transformation. Every activity needs to be judged by 
its relevance to this process and adjusted accordingly. 
Government is no exception to this. The activities of every 
department need to be rethought and ennobled. This process has 
started. Government must also play a pathfinding role for the 
community, provide the spearhead in the form of specific 
concentrated initiatives, and it is for this aspect that funding 
provision musts be made. 
  As indicated in the president's speech, this year will see 
the allocation of 2.5 billion rand to the Reconstruction and 
Development Program [RDP] Fund, a special instrument being 
created by legislation which will shortly be before the house. 
These funds have been found from decreases within the budgeted 
level of departmental expenditure -- in other words, without 
increasing the planned level of total spending. A list of the 
amounts contributed appears in the budget review. In this 
process the social service departments have naturally been 
largely spared. This diversion of funds represents slightly 
less than 3 percent of the current level of consumption spending 
by general government, and it is our judgment that an additional 
figure of this order can be similarly and additionally diverted 
in each of the next four years without thereby increasing the 
overall level of expenditure in real terms. In the planning 
budgets for those years we have therefore pencilled in the 
figures of 5 billion, 7.5 billion, 10 billion, and 12.5 billion 
for transmission to the RDP Fund, and the appropriations for all 
other departments will be required to adjust downward to 
accommodate this. 
  The steady build-up of these amounts over this extended 
period allows both for the existing government machine to plan 
the adjustments needed, and for the new spending directions to 
be organized effectively and to develop their own momentum. 
Applying even the initial 2.5 billion rand effectively before 
31 March 1995 already represents a real challenge which the new 
government structure is planning to meet in a methodical and 
carefully managed way. 
  As the responsible minister has explained, these fiscal 
injections represent only a part, though a very important part, 
of the program in its entirety. They will be supplemented by 
contributions from other governments and from the private 
sector, while the departments themselves have many programs of 
their own that can qualify as part of the larger program. We 
are therefore justified, we believe, in regarding the process 
set in train, as providing ample ammunition for this long-term 
campaign. There is no further need to pursue calculations 
regarding the ultimate cost of its completion. Instead, we have 
a process in which we can have confidence and which will develop 
as we progress. This process is made possible by a vision of 
where we are heading and how we want to get there. It will 
allow for programs that stretch over several fiscal years. 
Before we pass on from this topic, however, we should note that 
it will be vulnerable to two failures which we must guard 
against. If we allow the overall level of expenditure to climb 
in real terms, we will imperil the allocations which can be 
made. Equally important, if we do not produce a sound, 
effective, and attractive program, nobody will be able to 
motivate the department sufficiently to bring about the future 
diversions of spending which we plan. 
  Now let us turn to the question of the transition costs. In 
order to smooth the path of transition it was necessary -- who 
could deny it -- for us to have a period in which a Transitional 
Executive Council was active at the heart of government, and to 
create and give free rein to an Independent Electoral Commission 
to manage a free and fair election. BotP?&amp;?6?es delivered 
what 
was required of them, but both were operating in unchartered 
territory under extreme pressure from time to time, and most of 
the time, and neither of them, subject to the need to find the 
income needed to cover any items of expenditure they considered 
necessary. [sentence as heard] Through the grace of God we have 
had a wonderful transition, but we incurred costs of 4 billion 
rand. A list of these will be found in the budget revue. From 
the point of view of fiscal discipline this is regrettable. If 
left without response, such a minus could wipe out all the 
pluses that this government deserves for its commitment to the 
responsible economic governance of the country. Worse still, it 
could inhibit us from taking the dynamic growth-inducing steps 
that are called for now that the elections have freed us from so 
many other constraints. 
  We think the citizens of this country look to us to act 
boldly and to free ourselves as soon as possible from the 
consequences of past actions. We also think that every income 
earner in this country can be profoundly grateful that our 
transition has gone so very well. We think, therefore, that we 
should join together in meeting the greater part of this bill, 
put it behind us, and go on unhindered to exploit the exciting 
potential now available to us. In plain language that means that 
the government is proposing to levy individual and company 
taxpayers an amount equal to 5 percent of their taxable income. 
There are some important ameliorations to this. Firstly, all 
taxpayers will have the benefit of an abatement of 50,000 rand. 
Consequently, taxpayers earning less than this, which includes 
paying the Standard Income Tax on Employees or SITE only, will 
pay nothing, while the effective levy on a taxpayer with a 
taxable income of 70,000 rand will only be 1,000 rand. 
Secondly, the adjustment to the Pay As You Earn tables for 
individuals will be such as to recover the appropriate amount 
over the period up to 31 August 1995, rather than over the 7 
months to the end of February 1995. 
  Finally, the abatement for married women will be set at a 
higher level, which will take into account their disadvantage in 
tax rates when compared to other taxpayers. The total yield of 
this levy is expected to be of the order of 3.4 billion rand, of 
which some 2.6 billion rand will fall in this fiscal year with 
the balance being collected in the first half of the next fiscal 
year. 
  Well, I feel that the great majority of my fellow taxpayers 
will agree with this step as a way of putting the past behind 
us. There will no doubt be commentators aplenty to warn that 
such one-time levies are inclined to continue or to recur. This 
will not happen in this case, since at least half the 
expenditure was nonrecurring, and since it is our intention in 
any event to call a streamlined tax commission into existence to 
carry out a swift review of the tax mechanism with a view to 
assessing what improvements are required. It will be chaired by 
Professor Michael Katz, the chairman of the Tax Advisory 
Committee, and fans of Future Imperfect will be pleased to learn 
that Professor Dennis Davis will be a member. [laughter] The 
sessions will be lively. Insofar as it wishes to make 
recommendations for the 1995-96 financial year, it will have to 
report by the end of November 1994. That report will be 
published, comment will be invited, and government will then 
decide the issues during February 1995, in the run-up to the 
next budget in March. A notice announcing the remaining members 
and the terms of reference has been published today. 
  Having dealt with these major issues, we can now turn our 
attention to the discussion of developments leading up to 
today's budget, including the upturn of the 1993-94 financial 
year, the economic and policy environment of the budget, and the 
government's fiscal strategy. 
  The 1993-94 financial year was characterized by a 
commitment to structurally sound policies and to the effective 
implementation thereof. This was achieved mainly as a result of 
proactive tax measures and effective expenditure controls. In 
this latter respect, I wish to pay tribute to former minister of 
state expenditure Mr. Amie Venter and to his department. In 
very difficult times, they established and maintained the 
disciplinary framework which the government of national unity 
has happily inherited. The 1993-94 financial year not only 
represented the closing of a chapter of history, but also the 
start of meaningful progress toward cooperation and 
reconciliation on economic affairs. Many examples manifested 
themselves in this regard. The most prominent ones were 
undoubtedly the negotiation for the final foreign debt 
arrangement, the successful application for an International 
Monetary Fund financial facility, and the formulation of South 
Africa's trade liberalization proposals made to the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  The very important role of the National Economic Forum 
in the GATT initiative, as well as in helping to resolve various 
possible issues of conflict in the management of the economy, 
deserves recognition. These achievements show that the golden 
triangle of government, business, and unions can succeed, and 
that it has indeed laid a foundation for future cooperation and 
consultation. 
  The economic environment and economic policy framework: 
Today's budget is presented against the backdrop of a 
much-improved economic climate. Whereas previous budgets were 
constrained by negative rates of growth and double-digit 
inflation, both these indicators are now moving in the right 
direction. We anticipate positive real growth of some 3 percent 
for the fiscal year, and an inflation rate in the present range, 
figures which are significantly better than those which the 
country has experienced for many years. The economic outlook for 
both the international and domestic economy is encouraging. 
With economic growth gradually picking up in our major trading 
partner countries, commodity prices show some sign of rising. 
Coupled with a higher gold price, a continuation of the solid 
export performance is foreseen, although the livelier domestic 
economy could result in a smaller current account surplus on the 
balance of payments than in 1993. 
  The peaceful conditions after the elections augur well 
for the continuation of the economic recovery. Increased fixed 
investment expenditure, an expected rise in inventories, and a 
further recovery in real private consumption expenditure, 
together with a continuation of the good export performance, a 
significantly less burdensome foreign debt position, improved 
access to foreign markets, greater financial stability, 
improving business confidence, and the present favorable 
agricultural conditions are just some of the reasons for the 
more positive growth prospects for the economy. These factors 
are also being reflected in improved local and international 
business and consumer confidence with each day that passes. 
  In its investor dimension, using this confidence 
requires that South Africa should obtain an international, 
sovereign credit rating -- that is, a formal measure of risk 
associated with the borrower's willingness and ability to 
fulfill the loan obligations. Most institutional investors 
require such a rating as part of their investment criteria, and 
many investors set great store by them. Ratings therefore 
broaden the investor base for debt instruments, thereby 
maximizing investor demand and reducing the cost of funds. South 
Africa has taken the first steps in acquiring such a rating in 
the U.S. financial markets. The process is under way and will 
be completed this year. Success in this challenging 
international environment will require the liberalization of our 
international financial flows as soon as the preconditions 
previously stated by the governor of the Reserve Bank have been 
met. 
  The replenishment of our foreign reserves: These have 
been rising since the inauguration, and we expect the trend to 
continue. The Reserve Bank is closely monitoring developments 
and will make the necessary preparations to enable us to take 
action at the appropriate time. 
  Two important caveats should be mentioned as far as our 
international financial relations are concerned. First, we must 
guard against extravagant expectations regarding immediate 
capital flows into South Africa. Such flows will be slow to 
develop, and the country therefore still faces a balance of 
payments constraint. The need for continued adherence to the 
present responsible monetary policy is thus beyond any 
doubt. 
  A second caveat is that our endeavors to facilitate and 
broaden access to international financial markets should not be 
seen as attempts to find additional sources to finance a larger 
budget deficit, but rather as a substitute for domestic finance. 
This will not only result in a better balance between local and 
foreign debt, but will also ease pressures on the domestic 
financial market to the advantage of private sector borrowers. 
At this point I should like to express the country's thanks to 
the former director general of finance, Mr. Gerhardt Croeser, 
who made a signal contribution to good financial governance for 
many years, and who now represents us in Zurich as we establish 
closer links with the international financial community. 
  In forging these and other close links with the 
international community, we are guided by a clear vision of the 
kind of country we want to become: an open society trading 
freely with all other nations, investing liberally to increase 
our productive capacity, thus creating more and more jobs which 
in turn leads to an ever more attractive growing domestic 
market, and encouraging participation in the benefits of this 
development by our people, by our neighbors in southern Africa, 
and by kindred spirits all over the world. 
  Against this background, we can now move onto the 
fiscal strategy for the 1994-95 financial year and how we plan 
to realize it. 
  The fiscal strategy for 1994-95: This budget is the 
first of a number of budgets of this government that will have 
to meet with three considerations -- first, laying the base for 
public finance to be one of the principal instruments for the 
reconstruction and development of our country; second, 
contributing through fiscal discipline to macroeconomic 
stabilization as a crucial element in economic growth; and 
third, embodying institutional change in the process of 
transition from the old to the new constitutional order. This 
strategy obviously necessitates new policy measures and 
structures to underpin, or where necessary even replace, those 
already in place. Any discussion of the expenditure and revenue 
proposals must take these considerations into account. 
  The format of the budget: Two major changes in the 
budget presentation must be explained. The first is the result 
of constitutional change and involves the incorporation into the 
budget of the national government of erstwhile revenue 
diversions to, and budgetary shortfalls from, former regional 
authorities. The second is the more comprehensive inclusion of 
the informal sector in the calculation of the Gross Domestic 
Product, GDP, which resulted in an upward adjustment of 5.6 
percent in the GDP. Care should thus be taken in analyzing the 
budget figures to ensure comparability and avoid 
misinterpretations. A detailed discussion of the changed budget 
format and various other important matters, which -- due to time 
constraints -- I can touch on only briefly or not at all, appear 
in the budget review. 
  Expenditures: The total estimate of expenditure from 
the national revenue account for the 1994-95 financial year is a 
135.1 billion rands, which now covers all expenditures at the 
national and regional level, except those financed from the 
former regional administrations' own revenues. If we do not 
include the latter expenditure, current noninterests expenditure 
-- in other words, consumption expenditure and current transfers 
-- grow by only 6.5 percent. This figure will not materially be 
affected once allocations from the RDP funds begin to flow and 
we succeed in ridding ourselves from the cost incurred during 
the transition. The increase is substantially below the 
inflation rate, and bears testimony to our commitment to 
continue fiscal discipline. In view of the many and varied 
demands on the exchequer and the relatively small increase in 
estimated expenditures, continued rigorous financial control 
will be called for. The restructured Treasury Committee -- 
comprising the two deputy presidents, the minister of finance, 
and the minister without portfolio, who is also responsible for 
coordinating the reconstruction and development initiative -- 
will have an important role in this regard. 
  The committee's main function is to assist the cabinet 
in meeting the government's budgetary commitments. To that end, 
reordering of expenditure priorities during the course of the 
financial year, which will also involve RDP-related budgetary 
shifts and allocations, is a major element of this committee's 
activities. 
  I should now like to highlight some specific 
expenditures from this year's budget, details of which are 
printed in the budget review. 
  Civil and military pensions: Even in the much lower 
inflationary environment now prevailing, it is desirable to 
adjust pensions on an annual basis. This year's increases in 
civil and military pensions reflect the appreciably lower rate 
of inflation; and they are as follows. Civil pensions will rise 
by 5 percent with effect from 1 April 1994 for pensioners who 
retired on or before 1 July 1993. Those who retired later but 
before the 1 April 1994 will have their pensions raised by 0.56 
percent for each completed month since retirement. Pensions 
which have increased since retirement by a percentage which, 
after taking into account the increase just announced, does not 
yet equal 70 percent of the increase in the Consumer Price Index 
since retirement, will be further increased to that level. 
Military pensions will rise by 5.6 percent with effect from 1 
April 1994. 
  Next, social pensions: An amount of 418 million rands 
is being made available for a general increase in the various 
social pensions and the elimination of the existing backlog of 
potential beneficiaries. Further details will be made available 
by the minister for welfare and population development. 
  Next, employment creation: An amount of 292 million 
rands -- this is quite separate from the RDP fund -- will be 
available for job creation. The improved cooperation and 
participation of communities under the government of national 
unity will enhance the impact of this expenditure. 
  Financial and Fiscal Commission: The 1993 constitution 
makes provision for the establishment of a Financial and Fiscal 
Commission. The aims and functions of the commission are to 
apprise itself of all financial and fiscal information relevant 
to national, provincial, and local government administration, 
and to render advise and make recommendations regarding the 
finances of, and financial relations between, the three tiers of 
government. It is clear that the commission will play a crucial 
role in respect of financial and fiscal matters at all levels of 
government. In this, it will face a daunting task that must be 
tackled with the utmost urgency. I hope to make an announcement 
regarding the appointments to the commission in the near 
future. 
  Revenues: The present level of taxation relative to the 
state 
of the economy can be regarded as adequate. This encouraging 
situation is to a large extent the result of the structurally 
sound tax changes introduced last year. Based on existing tax 
rates, the total consolidated estimate of revenue for the 
National Revenue Account is 104.3 billion rands, 11.2 percent 
above the comparable figure for 1993-94. This figure includes 
all revenue at national and regional level, except the own 
revenue collections of the former regional administrations. 
  Excise Duties: Maintaining our sound tax structure requires 
that we should revise excise taxes upwards, in line with the 
general level of price increases on a regular basis. After 
consultations with the affected industries, the following 
increases are proposed: beer, 6 cents per liter, or about 2 
cents per 340-ml can or so-called dumpy; spirits -- example 
whiskey, brandy, and gin -- about 53 cents per 750-ml bottle; 
cigarettes, about 7 cents per 10 cigarettes; cigarette tobacco, 
about 9 cents per 50 grams; pipe tobacco and cigars, 65 cents 
per kilogram; unfortified wine, 4.5 cents per 750-ml bottle; 
fortified wine, about 5 cents per 750-ml bottle; sparkling wine, 
about 6 cents per 750-ml bottle; other fermented drinks such as 
cider, about 2 cents per 340-ml can; sorghum beer, 1 cent per 
liter. Sorghum beer powder, 5 cents per kilogram; and cold 
drinks and mineral water, about 1 cent per liter. 
  The increases are roughly in line with the rate of 
inflation, 
but where rates have been significantly out of line with similar 
products, the increases attempt to eliminate at least part of 
the discrepancy. The increase in the excise duty on tobacco 
products is a special case. Based on health considerations, 
arguments have been put forward for an increase in the excise 
duty to 50 percent of the retail price, which is the order of 
impost in many other countries. After consultations with all 
interested groups, and taking into account industry's specific 
limitations and market conditions, government has opted for a 
phased approach, which is reflected in the announced increase. 
Future budgets will have to deal with the remainder of this 
issue. 
  The announced excise increases should yield some 525 million 
rands in a full year, and some 350 million rands for the 
remainder of this financial year. These adjustments take effect 
immediately. In accordance with Section 58 (1) of the Customs 
and Excise Act 1965, I now lay the formal tax proposals for 
excise duties on the table for consideration by Parliament. 
  Transition levy: As argued earlier, a levy to defray the 
greater part of the transition costs is called for, and the 
transition levy will be on individuals and companies with 
taxable income in excess of 50,000 rands. 
  Individuals: The levy will be 5 percent, of which 3.33 
percent based on 1995 taxable income is to be collected by 28 
February 1995, and the balance of 1.67 percent based on 1996 
taxable income by the end of August 1995. In view of the 
existing disparity between married men and women, the levy will 
only be imposed on income exceeding 175,000 rands in the case of 
married women. Revised tax tables will be issued in due course. 
Taxpayers of the former TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, 
and Ciskei] states will also be liable for the levy on the 
equivalent of taxable income as defined in the applicable 
legislation. It is expected that this levy will yield an 
estimated 1.46 billion rands for the current financial year, and 
a further 800 million rands up to August 1995. 
  Companies: A rate of 5 percent will apply on taxable income 
of companies in excess of 50,000 rands, in respect of years of 
assessment ending during the period of 12 months up to 31 March 
1995. Assessed losses brought forward from previous years will 
not be set off in determining such taxable income. Companies 
registered in the former TBVC states will also be liable for the 
levy in the equivalent of taxable income before the deduction of 
assessed losses incurred during previous years, as defined in 
the legislation applicable to those countries. This levy on 
companies is expected to yield some 1.116 billion rands during 
this financial year. 
  The General Export Incentive Scheme, GEIS: The GEIS scheme 
is currently under review within the National Economic Forum, 
and proposals for amendment are expected shortly. Payments 
under the present scheme are exempt from taxation, which is 
unsound in principle and of small effect in increasing the 
incentive value of the payments to the recipients. Notice is 
therefore given that we intend withdrawing the tax exemption in 
respect of assistance under GEIS with effect from 1 March 1995. 
  Based on the matters which I have dealt with up to this 
point, the projected budget deficit, which was 6.9 percent last 
year on the updated estimate of GDP, will be 6.3 percent for the 
new year. This is a meritorious decrease in the deficit, which 
becomes more so when we remember that a further almost 0.2 
percent of GDP will be collected in the next fiscal year, as we 
complete our collections of the transitional levy from PAYE [Pay 
As You Earn] taxpayers. 
  Viewing these figures, the government has decided to lose no 
time in taking two initiatives aimed directly at the stimulation 
of investment, growth, and, consequently, jobs. 
  Import surcharge: The first concerns the immediate removal 
of the import surcharge on all capital and intermediate goods, 
that is, all goods carrying the 5 percent surcharge. The cost 
to the fiscus for a full year is some 1.2 billion rands, and for 
the remainder of the financial year some 800 million rands, or 
slightly less than 0.2 percent of GDP. The removal of the 
remaining surcharges will not be considered now, as it may be 
more appropriate to deal with them in the light of 
recommendations made by the tax commission. 
  Income tax, companies: The second initiative is to complete 
the process of structural reform of corporate tax which we began 
last year. This involves lowering the corporate rate from 40 
percent to 35 percent as from 1 April 1994, while partly 
compensating for this by raising the secondary tax on companies 
from 15 percent to 25 percent with immediate effect. 
  The net sacrifice involved this year is some 0.14 percent 
of GDP or 600 million rands. This will be covered in future 
years by the taxation of GEIS payments so that the corporate 
sector as such will be paying the same tax but in a framework 
which is far more favorable for new small and medium companies, 
and for those most capable of generating greater growth through 
heavy reinvestment of profits. The outcome of the tax proposals 
is an estimated net increase on the printed estimate of 1.5 
billion rands, a reduction of 450 million rands for Customs and 
Excise, and an increase of 1.9 billion for Inland Revenue. 
Total revenue for the national government is therefore 
estimated to increase by 11.2 percent to 105.8 billion rands in 
1994-95. 
  Before dealing with the financing of the deficit, a few 
other 
tax issues require brief mention. Firstly, the harmonization of 
the tax systems of South Africa and the former TBVC states will 
be undertaken in phases starting this year. Secondly, the Tax 
Advisory Committee is investigating the taxation of gains and 
losses arising from financial instruments, and plans to issue a 
consultative document in this regard. Thirdly, consideration is 
being given by Inland Revenue to the introduction of revised 
provisions to facilitate unbundling and rationalization schemes. 
Details on these issues are contained in the budget review, and 
more information where applicable will be announced at the 
appropriate times. 
  The budget deficit and public debt: After the tax proposals 
take effect, the final consolidated budget deficit will be 6.6 
percent of GDP by March 1995, or equivalent to 66.4 percent if 
the full collection of the levy is taken into account. This 
compares with 6.9 percent last year on the same basis, and 
confirms that the downward trend as regards budgetary deficits 
is alive and well. Total expenditure, including the 
supplementary proposals, for '94-95 is estimated at 135.1 
billion rands. The estimated revenue, including the tax 
proposals, is 105.8 billion rands, and leaves a budget deficit 
of 29.3 billion rands. Taking into account loan redemptions and 
the balance brought forward from the previous year, the 
financing requirement is 36.5 billion rands. This amount will 
again be financed primarily from the sale of domestic stock, 
although provision is also made for some foreign loans. 
Financing of this magnitude, inclusive of regional finances, 
should not influence the financial markets unduly, or put upward 
pressure on interest rates. 
  As an interim measure, the minister of finance was on the 
27th of April 1994 authorized to take over the debt of some 15 
billion rands of the former TBVC states and self-governing 
territories as debt of the national government. The allocation 
of the asset-related part of this debt to the provinces, as 
determined by the Constitution, will be finalized at a later 
date. It should be emphasized that this is not new debt, and 
that previous budgets provided for its servicing cost. 
  In contrast to the practice last year of funding the deficit 
in as short a period as possible, deficits are currently being 
funded as and when they arise. This approach not only prevents 
the accumulation of large exchequer balances lying idle, but 
also facilitates the development of a more active market for 
government stock. The authorities have also implemented a 
system of treasury, tax and loan accounts since 1st February 
1994, whereby tax and loan receipts are deposited in tax and 
loan accounts of clearing banks and held in the respective 
accounts until the money is required by government. 
  The flow of funds between the private sector and the 
Reserve Bank, which at times in the past has considerably 
disrupted the money market, has now been eliminated, thus 
simplifying money market management and contributing to better 
cash flow management within the government sector, which in turn 
reduces the net cost of financing. 
  I would now like to express my thanks. Budget planning and 
preparation, presentation, and eventual execution involves the 
dedication, cooperation, and plain hard work of many people. I 
pay tribute to the directors general and the staff in the 
departments of finance and of state expenditure, who have made 
this very complex transition budget happen. The cooperation of 
government departments, the various regional authorities, and 
other institutions, especially the South African Reserve Bank, 
was indispensable, and I also thank them. 
  The departments of finance and state expenditure will remain 
separate departments, but their present directors general, Dr. 
Estian Calitz and Mr. Hannes Smit, who remain in their 
positions, now both report to me. We welcome on board Mr. Alec 
Irwin as deputy minister, and at the same time pay tribute to 
his predecessor, Dr. Theo Alant, who was a valued member of our 
team. 
  Another relative newcomer is Mr. Trevor van Heerden, the 
commissioner of Inland Revenue. Mr. van Heerden succeeded Mr. 
Johannes Hattingh, who retired after a distinguished career in 
Inland Revenue. We look forward to working with these 
newcomers, and have confidence that with the continued support 
of the rest of management and the valued advise of Dr. Japie 
Jakobs, my special economic adviser, we hope to be able to serve 
the needs of the people of our country. 
  The success we have achieved and need to achieve with 
budgetary control depends, ultimately, on the support given by 
the head of the government. I am very fortunate to have had 
unstinting support since assuming this position, from my first 
appointment in May 1992, right up to the present day, and wish 
to convey my sincere thanks and appreciation to the leaders 
concerned for this vital factor. 
  The budget in perspective: Building on the sound fiscal 
performance of the past year, today's budget confronts the 
challenges head-on. The reconstruction and development 
imperative is addressed through the first of several allocations 
from existing resources to the RDP fund. The program itself 
will also be bolstered by the existing and substantial 
socioeconomic expenditures which are directly or indirectly 
related to reconstruction and development. 
  Concomitantly, fiscal discipline is being maintained through 
the further reduction in the budget deficit as a percentage of 
GDP. Within that constraint, it was nonetheless possible to 
improve the corporate tax structure, and to take a major step 
reducing the cost of imported capital and intermediate goods. 
The once-off levy in income tax effectively closes the 
financial book on the transition without jeopardizing the fiscal 
progress made thus far. In planning our future strategies, we 
shall be able to draw on the insights of the tax and the 
financial and fiscal commissions. This government has the 
legitimacy, the capacity, and the resolve to succeed. It is 
determined to pursue both social justice and aggressive growth, 
the best of both those worlds, and the budget seeks to embody 
this aim. 
  The members of the government, the members of this house, 
and 
our millions of fellow citizens have spent the past several 
years demonstrating our ability to set the highest goals, and to 
achieve them. This is one more. Let's do it again. Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Derek Keys by SABC </F>
correspondent Leslie Mashokwe in Cape Town on the "Newsline" 
program -- live] 
  [Text] [Mashokwe] Good evening, Mr. Keys, and welcome to 
Newsline. Mr. Keys, what did you intend doing with this year's 
budget? 
  [Keys] We really tried to do two main things. The first one 
is to make sure that the Reconstruction and Development Program 
[RDP] got what it needed to get under way, and that I think we 
have managed to do. The second one was to make sure that we 
did everything that we could to facilitate growth. Now that's 
got two sides to it. First of all, we've got to make sure that 
we've got macroeconomic stability, that we've got reasonable 
inflation rates and interest rates, and so on. Secondly, we've 
got to be sure that we remove any obstacles that there are in 
the structure which hinder growth. That's why we took off the 
import surcharge and changed the corporate tax. 
  [Mashokwe] In balancing that act between not spending too 
much money and making sure that the RDP is implemented, how did 
you manage to balance the books? 
  [Keys] We tried to do what was practical. I've worked a lot 
with large organizations. When you take a large organization 
and you want to turn it in direction, as far as what it's doing 
is concerned, then one knows that making it move 3 percent a 
year is the sort of term which you can manage reasonably easily. 
Two percent a year on our level of consumption expenditure for 
general government is 2.5 billion rands a year. So that's 
really what determined the 2.5 billion. It also happens to be 
the sort of sum that will allow Minister Without Portfolio Jay 
Naidoo to really get under way. 
  [Mashokwe] But they are still saying that you did not give 
any new money to the RDP. Instead, you took some money from 
other departments, as if to say the RDP was a separate animal 
that had to be fed with a few rands and cents in order to bring 
better life to people. 
  [Keys] No, on the contrary, the RDP has to have priority. 
The president has made this quite clear to the cabinet; he has 
made it quite clear to the nation. And I'm perfectly convinced 
that 2.5 billion is going to be an amount that takes a lot of 
managing between now and the end of March next year. The year 
after that, it's 5, the year after that it's 7.5, and so on, 
assuming that we're able to keep everything in place. I'm 
satisfied that as a spear- heading unit, that unit of Minister 
Naidoo's will have all the funds that it needs. 
  [Mashokwe] But the sums that had been bandied around, 
something like 89 billion for the RDP -- you say we should not 
concern ourselves with those figures? 
  [Keys] That's right. It's a mistake. It's.... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] How then will South Africans be 
able 
to get what they were promised? 
  [Keys] Well, they'll get it through this process which will 
concentrate on using the funds that we're giving to the RDP 
fund, to leverage other funds, to make various schemes possible. 
For instance, the mortgage indemnity scheme, the mortgage 
insurance scheme, which is going to make housing finance 
available from the private sector to people who wouldn't qualify 
for it now. That will require a trickle of funds, compared to 
the funds that can be mobilized by putting such a scheme in 
place. So I think we have to see the funds that have been put 
under Minister Naidoo's command, we have to see them as, in a 
sense, seed money, or leverage money, money that can get other 
activities going. 
  [Mashokwe] But if one reads the spirit and letter of the 
RDP, 
it's almost like saying these are things that the previous 
government should have done. Now the ANC was on that ticket, 
saying: We promise you a million houses and all sorts of 
things. But you're treating it as if the RDP is a separate 
animal, with separate funds, and one has to ask the question, is 
this an ANC government and an NP [National Party] budget? What 
are we talking about? 
  [Keys] No, it's a budget of the government of national 
unity, 
I'm happy to say. No, there's nothing separate about it. As 
you know, Minister Naidoo is right in the president's office, so 
he's at the center of the entire government machine. He's a 
member of the treasury committee, on which the other members are 
myself and the two deputy presidents, which is the central 
committee as far as allocation of spending and so on, and 
changes in the allocation of spending are concerned. So his 
activities and those of the machine are intermeshed to the 
greatest possible extent, and one must remember that there are 
many programs in the existing level of spending of government 
departments which -- perhaps with a slight change of emphasis, 
perhaps with a little modification here or there -- are 
admirably suited to be part of the RDP program. 
  [Mashokwe] What does this budget mean to the ordinary South 
Africans? It would appear there's nothing for the poor, for 
instance. No relief for them. 
  [Keys] The poorer have to be helped, basically, on the 
expenditure side of the budget, because you can't do much with 
tax concessions for people who don't pay taxes. So poor 
assistance has to come on the expenditure side. The RDP, of 
course, is concerned with uplifting the poor, so that they're 
right in the target areas as far as that's concerned. The 
president in his speeches has already started that process 
going, with feeding at schools, with free medical services, and 
so on. So the poor have to look to what's being spent for 
alleviation of their position. 
  [Mashokwe] We have 292 million for job creation. Is 
government creating these funds, or are you creating a climate 
conducive for spending? 
  [Keys] The 292 is really a hang-over from last year. You 
remember the government last year started a program in 
cooperation with the National Economic Forum, and the funds, 
most of those funds, hadn't been allocated by the time the 
change of government took place. So those funds were rolled 
over into this year, and that 292 is really the funds which the 
National Economic Forum has used as part of its program, which 
it's now successfully allocated, and they will be spent this 
year. 
  [Mashokwe] We also hear every year that a certain amount of 
money is being put aside for use in a particular field, yet the 
bureaucracy, the big bureaucracy that we have, the civil service 
that we have, big as it is, does not seem to be able to deliver 
the goods, as it were, to people. How are you going to do it 
differently this time? Those people are still in place; the 
structures are still intact. 
  [Keys] Yes. I don't think it's those people, as such, that 
were the problem. In certain instances it may be, but I think 
that the fundamental problem was that that kind of spending had 
tremendous political overtones, at a time when the previous 
government was in power. That ought to have changed now, and 
I'm very much looking forward to seeing whether it has changed, 
and the extent to which that now facilitates the delivery. 
  [Mashokwe] I'm still surprised that we heard nothing about, 
you know, the much-publicized wish of the African National 
Congress then, in wanting to make a smaller, more efficient 
civil service. Instead, we seem to be having a bigger civil 
service, with all nine provinces and all departments in those 
areas. 
  [Keys] Yes. Don't forget that the nine provinces replace 
16 other administrations which were there before, and they ought 
to be very much more effective and very much better connected to 
the center. All of their civil servants will be members of one 
civil service organization. I think the whole thing is going to 
be potentially much easier to control. But there will be 
transitional problems, where you have the old administrations 
which have to function for a while, where functions have to be 
transferred, where there's a certain amount of hang-over in the 
system, and so on. So short term, we're going to have problems, 
but longer term, I think we're in a position to run a more 
efficient ship. 
  [Mashokwe] I'm not minimizing the amount of passengers that 
we had -- that's the bottom line -- we're still stuck with a big 
infrastructure, a big bureaucracy. Nothing has changed. 
  [Keys] Yes, it's quite a big country, but the constitution, 
you know, guarantees all the civil servants their positions and 
their pensions, and everything else, which is a necessary step 
when you go through a big change like this. 
  [Mashokwe] Let's talk about the transitional levy, 5 
percent, 
that I have to pay. One would ask a question like: Did this 
government, the past government, not know that we were going to 
go through a transitional period? Did you not have any 
contingency plans? Why should we be taxed for a transformation 
that was so necessary? 
  [Keys] Well, the transformation was necessary, but it cost 
money. If we simply borrowed the money that it cost, then we 
would run a bigger deficit than we ran last year, and we'd be 
branded as spendthrifts. 
  [Mashokwe] But you knew you were going to go through a 
transition, Mr. Keys. Was it not necessary to have made a 
contingency plan then, rather than moving to a levy that is 
going to carry into the next financial year? 
  [Keys] My contingency plan was the levy. 
  [Mashokwe] Okay, let's talk about issues like social 
spending. You are saying you're going to level the playing 
fields now -- no more blacks getting fewer pension pay-outs. 
Does this mean that there won't be any increases for those who 
were already on a particular benchmark in terms of their 
payments, civil service payments, social spending? 
  [Keys] The social pension? You mean the old-age pension? 
There is a proposal which has been approved by cabinet, but it's 
got to be announced by the minister of welfare, dealing with the 
improvement of those pensions. 
  [Mashokwe] Black people will get the same pensions like.... 
  [Keys, interrupting] They already do, and they will in 
future, of course, as well. 
  [Mashokwe] Okay. Let's talk about the other points that we 
need to be looking at. What about the fact that you have not 
announced any relief? You said there will be job creation for 
292 million rands. Any relief for people in distress? No 
contingency there as well? 
  [Keys] The people in distress are, as I say, on the spending 
side of the budget. It has to be taken care of in the RDP 
program. The president has already started that process. 
  [Mashokwe] What about the most contentious issue -- elderly 
people are worried about the fact that they were not given free 
medical attention. Is anything going to be done in that regard? 
  [Keys] Well, I think you will have to talk to the 
responsible 
minister as far as that's concerned. 
  [Mashokwe] But you hold the purse strings. 
  [Keys] Well, I don't hold the purse strings, in the sense 
that everybody, the whole cabinet, understands and accepts that 
what we spend has to come out of limited resources, and so we 
now going through a process of reprioritizing different types of 
expenditure, and this is something....[pauses] You can't go 
through that process as a minister unless you know your 
department rather well. So this will take a little while. 
  [Mashokwe] What about the nine provinces that we have? Are 
you going to spend more money there? Are you going to spend 
less money there, as opposed to the TBVC [Transkei, 
Bophuthatswana, Venda, and Ciskei] states that we had in the 
past? 
  [Keys] We're going to spend, overall, the same amount of 
money. That's what keeping the level of consumption expenditure 
in real terms means. But I hope it's going to be a more 
effective system. 
  [Mashokwe] I'm still wanting to understand exactly how we're 
going to say this budget benefits the ordinary person in the 
street. You removed import surcharges, for instance. What does 
it mean to me and you? 
  [Keys] The benefit to the man in the street in this budget 
will have to come from the way in which government spends the 
money that it is spending. It can't come in the income side. 
  [Mashokwe] Creating a climate for economic growth? Are we on 
course? 
  [Keys] Yes, absolutely. That's why we've reduced the cost of 
investment goods, and we've made it easier and profitable for 
companies to keep their profits and reinvest them, rather than 
declaring them as dividends. 
  [Mashokwe] Explain to me exactly what you meant when you 
explained the tax on married wives. How are they going to 
benefit? 
  [Keys] They'll benefit through not paying the levy, 
fundamentally, and that will largely redress any disadvantage 
that they have. Their disadvantage is a historical thing. It's 
developed out of the fact that for generations, almost, there 
was no such thing as separate tax for married women. They were 
simply bundled into the income of their husbands and taxed as a 
unit. A process then started, as a result of women's lib -- 
perfectly understandably. A process started to have separate 
taxation, but in the course of that we've ended at a point where 
they actually pay slightly higher tax than they ought to. Now 
we've taken care of the situation in this year by exempting -- 
largely exempting -- them from the levy, unless they earn more 
than 175,000 rands. Next year the matter will be taken care of 
by the recommendations of the tax commission. 
  [Mashokwe] While speaking about tax, we notice that you have 
reduced tax on companies again, yet tax on individuals is not 
reduced. 
  [Keys] I haven't reduced tax overall on the corporate 
sector. 
We are taxing GEIS [General Export Incentive Scheme], we are 
taxing dividends more heavily, and that's paid by the companies. 
This is not a tax that's paid by the recipients. Those two 
things balance out the lower corporate rates, so what we've 
actually done is, within a fixed amount of income that we get 
from the corporate sector, we've made a rearrangement which 
induces growth to a greater extent than the previous arrangement. 
  [Mashokwe] But you know for a fact that South Africans are 
complaining that they are heavily taxed, with the 5 percent levy 
and the heavy tax that you have not reduced. How do you hope 
that they are going to survive? 
  [Keys] Well, you know, one has to survive by giving a 
certain 
priority to the payments that need to be made, of which tax is 
one. So one accepts that there's a certain amount of hardship 
involved. We've done our best to make that very light, make the 
burden very much lighter at the lower income levels than at the 
higher income levels. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Minister, it's almost like the more you earn, 
the more you get taxed, as if it's a sin to earn more in a 
capitalist country, so to say. Where are we headed for? 
  [Keys] Almost every country's taxation system is 
progressive; 
the more you earn, the more you pay. That's based on the 
principle of ability to pay and a certain amount of social 
equity. 
  [Mashokwe] Talk about the new tax structure. We had the Mago 
Commission, now another commission. Seemingly we're into a 
business of commissions, and we the taxpayers foot the bill. 
  [Keys] This is a commission with a difference. To the extent 
that it wants to make recommendations about changing the 
taxation system, it has to do so by November this year, and that 
report will be immediately published. It will be available for 
comment by everybody who's interested, by every taxpayer, and 
it's only in February of the next year that the government will 
take the decisions on the recommendations, after it's had all 
this comment. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Minister, thanks for your time, and thanks 
for 
talking to us. 
  [Keys] Thank you very much. I enjoyed it.

  [Excerpts] Gabonese Prime Minister Casimir Oye-Mba has 
been in parliament since this morning to present his general 
policy program, in line with Article 28-A of the Gabonese 
Constitution. Casimir Oye-Mba's policy statement centered on 
several very important issues: the consolidation of democracy, 
the affirmation of state authority, the economy, foreign policy, 
and national solidarity. On the issue of state solidarity, 
Casimir Oye-Mba focused on the need to bridge the social gap, 
notably in housing and living standards. He stated: 
  [Begin Oye-Mba recording] One of the conditions for ensuring 
the well-being of the people is to ensure that every citizen 
lives under acceptable conditions, that is, that every citizen 
has decent accommodation. So, the government's action in this 
direction will center on a more rigorous policy, which will 
ensure that every Gabonese has access to better living 
standards. [end recording] 
  Prime Minister Casimir Oye-Mba also defended the amended 
budget, and said it was needed to win the confidence of 
creditors and reduce state spending. He added: 
  [Begin recording] The amended budget is based on the 
following premises: About 16 million tons of oil production, at 
$13 per barrel and at the rate of 600 CFA to the dollar. After 
balancing revenues and expenditures, the amended budget is fixed 
at 716 billion CFA, as compared with 415 billion CFA in the 
initial budget. Concerning expenditures, there is a clear 
increase in the recurrent and capital budgets. The recurrent 
budget increased from 246 billion CFA to 305 billion CFA. The 
59 billion CFA difference, which resulted from the effects of 
the devaluation of the CFA franc, is disbursed as follows: 15 
billion to cover the increase in the total wage bill; 3 billion 
for goods and services -- with nearly 80 percent of the amount 
earmarked for the social sector -- notably national education, 
health, higher education, and social affairs. This special 
effort naturally aims at checking falling educational standards, 
halting the disruption of the health care delivery system caused 
by mounting drug prices, and safeguarding our social assets.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] Good evening! In Lusaka, there is much expectation 
on the debate regarding the installation of the National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] and its high 
officials. Despite the fact that their differences have been 
narrowed, the government and UNITA negotiators are still meeting 
alone in the search for a solution for accommodations for Jonas 
Savimbi's organization and its senior leaders. This afternoon's 
meeting began at 1700 and has not yet been concluded. That is 
why there is great expectation about the meeting. We may give 
more details about the meeting soon. 
  Meanwhile, UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye 
and 
members of the troika of observers are ready to leave for Cape 
Town, South Africa. They will leave the Zambian capital early 
morning tomorrow. In South Africa, the special representative 
of the UN secretary general in Angola and his team will request 
assistance from President Nelson Mandela with the Angolan peace 
talks, taking advantage of his influence and the prestige 
enjoyed by the new president of that country.

  [Excerpts] Kampala, 23 Jun (PANA) -- The global Pan-African 
Movement (PAM) has reacted angrily to Wednesday [22nd June]'s 
endorsement, by the United Nations Security Council, of France's 
initiative to lead a humanitarian force into Rwanda. "It is with 
horror and shocked disbelief that we heard that the UN secretary 
general, Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, has recommended to the UN 
Security Council to accept the French offer of military 
intervention in Rwanda supposedly to stop the continuing 
massacre of civilians," said a statement issued by PAM 
secretariat Thursday in Kampala. 
  The statement dated 22nd June and signed by Dr Taj al-Din 
'Abd- al-Rahim, the PAM general secretary, said the organization 
is horrified because it could not believe that Ghali [as 
received] could recommend the intervention against the 
background of "similar unilateralist military intervention by 
the United States in Somalia and the tragic consequences of that 
misadventure." 
  "It will seem to us that both Dr. Ghali and the United 
Nations cannot learn from one mistake. Maybe the UN secretary 
general thinks two tragic mistakes are better than one. But at 
what cost?" The statement asks. 
  The release says PAM is shocked because the secretary 
general 
is an African with decades of political experience both as 
foreign minister and prime minister of Egypt. "With that 
experience one would have thought he would be better informed in 
advising the United Nations and the Security Council to be 
cautious and sensitive to the needs and concerns of Africans." 
[passage omitted] 
  PAM accused the UN secretary general of taking decisions on 
Africa saying "his stewardship at the United Nations so far, has 
witnessed the most insensitive and outrageous decisions on 
matters concerning Africa, of which his current endorsement of 
French military intervention in Rwanda is a tragic example." 
  The statement says there are many Africans who think Ghali 
has been exercising his powers, without any sense of 
responsibility." The ease with which he seems to accede to any 
Western unilateral designs on Africa makes it very difficult to 
refute such critics. He seems unable to ask why each time the 
United States and her Western allies order him to jump, his only 
query seems to be: How high?" 
  PAM believes that the historical link between France and 
Rwanda would compromise "any moral or political concern that 
France may now be feigning". It blamed France and Belgium for 
"perpetration of brutal rule and systematic genocide in Rwanda." 
  In the three-page statement, the Kampala-based organization 
said it believes that France has a hidden agenda to repossess 
the Central African state as a French colony, prevent the rebels 
of Rwandan Patriotic Front from military victory and create 
another Liberia type of stalemate in that country. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] The skirmishing in Liberia seems to go on every day 
without a break. ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for 
Democracy in Liberia], Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic 
Front of Liberia], the ECOMOG [Economic Community of West 
African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] peacekeeping force, 
all seem to be involved in shoot-outs in various parts of the 
country. Now an unknown group has tried to launch a raid by sea 
on Monrovia. From Monrovia, Nii Nartey Allison telexed this 
report. 
  According to a spokesman for the African peacekeeping force, 
more than 100 people suspected of trying to launch a nighttime 
seaborne attack on their headquarters on Tuesday [21 June] had 
been arrested. Details surrounding the incident remain scanty, 
but the spokesman for the peacekeepers, Major Edema Syllo today 
confirmed that some of the suspects had escaped after a heavy 
exchange of gunfire with the peacekeepers' gunboat which had 
moved in from the nearby Free Port of Monrovia. He said that 
those arrested are still being interrogated and that their 
identity had not yet been established. 
  Maj. Syllo said about the same time as the seaborne attack, 
a 
formation of peacekeeping troops in the Harbel area had come 
under fire from fighters of Charles Taylor's NPFL. On the ULIMO 
front, he said that peacekeeping troops had moved into 
Brewerville late on Wednesday [22 June] after a fierce gun 
battle in the area between rival ULIMO factions. He added: 
Seven bodies were discovered in a well there. 
  Meanwhile, the field commander of the African peacekeeping 
force, Maj. General John Inienger, today expressed his 
objections to warring factions using Monrovia as a base for 
their propaganda and for operations. He said: If they go on, 
this could lead to a legal and military problem for ECOMOG under 
the Cotonou Accord.

  [Text] The police today announced the arrest of Chief 
Moshood Abiola. The police public relations officer at the 
(?corps) headquarters said the arrest was effected at his Ikeja 
residence last night when he resurfaced from his hideout. The 
police had earlier this month declared Chief Abiola wanted and 
called for information that could lead to his arrest. 
  The police also said that the activities of Chief Abiola and 
his group transcended the quest for the actualization of the 12 
June phenomenon. It said the activities included well-laid down 
plans to cause a breakdown of law and order as well as the 
forceful overthrow of the Federal Military Government. 
  In a fresh statement today, the police expressed 
appreciation 
to the entire public for the cooperation they received during 
the search for Abiola and assured that the entire activities of 
Chief Abiola from 12 June last year to date were under thorough 
investigation and advised members of the public to go about 
their normal businesses and report suspicious elements to the 
police.

<F P=106> [By Jacques Pinto] </F>
  [Excerpts] Lagos, June 23 (AFP) -- Nigerian opposition 
parties held urgent consultations as international condemnation 
poured in Thursday [23 June] after police arrested Moshood 
Abiola, the opposition leader widely believed to have won last 
June's cancelled presidential election. 
  Chief Abiola was arrested at his Lagos home after addressing 
a rally in the business metropolis and taken early Thursday to 
the federal capital Abuja, his aides said. The Moslem 
millionaire had resurfaced just hours before after escaping 
house arrest and going into hiding 10 days earlier on the 
anniversary of the election cancelled by General Sani Abacha's 
military regime. 
  A leader of the National Democratic Campaign (Nadeco) who 
asked not to be named told AFP the opposition was meeting 
urgently to decide a course of action and would "definitely" 
challenge the arrest. "Street demonstrations either Thursday or 
Friday in Lagos by supporters of Abiola...cannot be ruled out," 
the Nadeco leader said. 
  The embassy of the United States, first foreign power to 
condemn the arrest, declared it raised "very serious questions 
with respect to the Nigerian government's commitment to 
restoring unhindered, civilian democracy and resolving the 
political crisis created by the annulment of the June 12, 1993, 
presidential election". 
  "The United States denounces this action and believes that 
all parties to the political process should be allowed to speak 
freely on all issues," said a statement made available to AFP. 
  In London, the Foreign Office said Britain was "very 
concerned" at the reports from here and hoped the developments 
would "not harm the search" for a way back toward "accountable 
civilian government." 
  Abacha meanwhile pressed on with a tour of Nigeria's main 
military bases begun Wednesday to assure himself of the armed 
forces' loyalty, national radio reported. 
  The tour came ahead of a Constitutional Conference scheduled 
for Monday in Abuja, which he has presented as the keystone of 
his program to give up power by stages but which the 
pro-democracy opposition grouped around Nadeco has dismissed as 
a farce. [passage omitted] 
  He visited the Third Armoured Division stationed in Jos, 
capital of the central Plateau state, and the Second Mechanized 
Division stationed at Ibadan, 140 kilometers (80 miles) north of 
Lagos, the Nigerian press said. The heads of the army, navy and 
air force attended the meetings. 
  Abacha also announced special end-of-service bonuses and 
deliveries of equipment and uniforms to the troops, the daily 
Guardian said. 
  Abiola, who declared himself president and commander of the 
armed forces on June 11 in defiance to the Abacha regime, had 
pledged to some 2,000 cheering people on Wednesday that he would 
present a government. It was his first public appearance since 
he disappeared on June 11. [passage omitted] 
  Other opposition leaders arrested during a month of growing 
resistance to Abacha's regime have been detained in Lagos and 
charged with treason in the federal high court. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Lagos, June 23 (AFP) -- Hundreds of youths chanting 
anti-government slogans and calling for the immediate release of 
Chief Moshood Abiola late Thursday [23 June] held a peaceful 
march along major streets in the commercial nerve-centre of 
Lagos. 
  They carried placards reading "release Abiola our president 
now," "Abacha must go," and "away with military regime." 
  The police did not disrupt the march, which was the first 
physical reaction to the arrest of Chief Abiola in the morning 
hours of Thursday.

  [Text] In Lusaka, Zambia, negotiating teams from the 
government and the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] concluded discussions on the installation of 
UNITA and its senior officials in the government. The document

Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the UN secretary 
general in Angola and mediator at the peace talks in Lusaka. 
Alves Antonio has further details. 
  The leaderships of the negotiating teams from the government

  [Text] [Announcer] The clashes are still on in the country. 
The city of Kuito, Bie Province, is still under intense 
shelling. Jonas Savimbi's troops are suffering heavy losses on 
the ground. Our correspondent Abel Abraao reports: 
  [Abraao] Kuito is still under intense shelling. While 
Jonas Savimbi's rebel organization continues shelling the 
defenseless residents, in the military field they are suffering 
heavy losses because the government forces have had enough of 
the provocations of National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] bandits. This was revealed to our news desk by 
Brigadier Damiano Mocume, second commander of the Angolan Armed 
Forces [FAA] regional command in Bie. Brigadier Mocume told 
Radio Nacional de Angola that over the past few hours the FAA 
intercepted and destroyed four vehicles carrying war materiel 
south of the city of Kuito. In Cuche commune, the FAA 
detachment was attacked but gave a lesson to Jonas Savimbi's 
soldiers, killing seven rebels and capturing [words indistinct] 
five 81-mm mortars with shells. 
  [Announcer] In Ganda District, Benguela Province, UNITA 
troops yesterday burned more than a dozen trucks belon+ging to 
the World Food Program, WFP, carrying food aid. Our 
correspondent Celestino Matos reports: 
  [Matos] More than a dozen WFP trucks were attacked and 
burned by UNITA forces when carrying food aid for Culango 
residents. The attack took place in the Lobito-Culango road, 
where the vehicles were carrying basic commodities for residents 
of that area who face acute food shortages. The extent of the 
damages caused to the convoy, which was unarmed, is not yet 
known. The WFP in Benguela has not yet reacted to the UNITA 
attack. 
  [Announcer] Lunda Norte Provincial Governor Moises Nele has 
described the situation as worrisome in his province, taking 
into account the increase in UNITA operations. Our 
correspondent reports: 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Lunda Norte Provincial 
Governor Moises Nele today described as worrisome the political 
and military situation in his jurisdiction. Nele, who is 
attending the third Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola [MPLA] regional meeting in Saurimo made his statements, 
in response to UNITA operations on the road linking Dundo to the 
diamond areas of Lusage and Lucapa. That official accused Zaire 
of involvement in the Angolan conflict.

  [Text] UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola] has stepped up its shelling of the city of Kuito and 
outlaying areas. Several people have either been killed or 
wounded. Clashes between government and UNITA troops have also 
been reported. The situation has been worsened by an 
unprecedented shortage of food. An average of 10 people starve 
to death in Kuito daily. Thousands of undernourished people 
could have the same fate in the next few days unless relief 
operations resume. 
  Meanwhile, UNITA continues to move men, including Zairian 
mercenaries, and war materiel to mount a large-scale offensive 
on the city of N'dalatando over the next few hours. Lieutenant 
General Manuel Jose Neco, commander of the Cuanza Norte 
Operational Area, says government forces continue to defend the 
city. UNITA's long-range artillery units are still shelling the 
city. Government forces have killed eight UNITA soldiers and 
captured assorted war materiel. Captured UNITA soldiers 
disclosed that Jonas Savimbi instructed Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola commando units from Huambo to retake the 
city of N'dalatando before the end of the month to further 
complicate the Lusaka peace talks.

  [Text] The air force of the Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola-Labor Party launched a strong attack on 
residential areas of the city of Bie [Kuito] on 21 June, killing 
and wounding many people. Several houses were destroyed. In 
addition to the war, many people are dying from famine and 
disease. The situation is worsened by the disruption of World 
Food Program stocks. [preceding word in English] Warehouses have 
either been hit by the regime's air force or plundered by the 
People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola.

  The convoy [words indistinct] in Bocoio District, was

minutes of clashes put the enemy troops to flight, leaving 
behind more than 25 of their comrades dead and many more 
captured. Our forces also destroyed all the vehicles and a 
large quantity of war materiel. The residents in the area have 
been capturing and handing over to our positions FAPLA soldiers, 
who in their shameful flight try to reach safer places.

  [Text] In the city of Kuito in Bie Province, despite minor 
interruptions in the shelling by the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], the situation has not 
improved. More than one dozen people were killed and many more 
wounded in the city today. After the heavy defeats it has 
suffered, it is thought that the rebel army is reorganizing to 
mount another offensive against the city of Kuito and its 
outskirts. Our correspondent Abel Abraao reports. 
  [Begin Abraao recording] UNITA on several occasions 
interrupted the shelling of the city today. This was followed 
by snipers' fire. A source from the government forces' 
operational command views the relative calm in the city of Kuito 
today as a preparation for future actions by the Black 
Cockerel's troops against the city and its outskirts, after the 
heavy defeats they suffered over the past 48 hours. Thus, it is 
expected that the city of Kuito will experience fierce clashes 
and violent shellings at a time when many people are dying in 
the war and from lack of medicine. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The new UDF [United Democratic Front] government in 
Malawi is already beginning to delve into the dealings of 
ex-President Banda, who was defeated in the multiparty elections 
last month. As always, when leaders fall, it is amazing what 
scandals their successors can find to discredit them with. From 
Blantyre, Willy Zingani telexed this report: 
  The rope is getting tighter and tighter around Dr. Banda's 
neck. The new UDF government is trying to discover whether the 
ex-president abused his position to enrich himself. One thing 
they claim to have discovered is that Dr. Banda received rent 
from 11 state houses which didn't belong to him. The new 
minister of information and broadcasting, Brown Mpinganjira, 
says he has documents proving that 2.5 million pounds was paid 
in recent years to Dr. Banda as rent for houses belonging to the 
state. 
  The new state president, Bakili Muluzi, hasn't commented on 
the matter. It is, therefore, not known whether Dr. Banda will 
be asked to pay back the money or be taken to court to answer 
charges. Since Dr. Banda's defeat in 17th May general election, 
Malawians have been shocked by the news that he had spent 8 
million pounds on a new state house in the Malawi capital, 
Lilongwe. Earlier this week, for the first time, journalists 
were allowed to enter the palaces to see how Dr. Banda lived. 
In one room, there were six telephone lines, and all rooms, 
including the garage, were air conditioned.

  [Text] Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader 
Afonso Dhlakama has returned a happy man from his visit to the 
United States where he projected a positive image of his 
movement. 
  On his return to Maputo, smiling broadly to journalists, the 
Renamo president said he now had an aversion to war and weapons. 
  Amid doubts and distrust, journalists insistently asked him 
whether Renamo has been handing over good quality weapons and 
whether he is truly demilitarizing his forces. Dhlakama firmly 
answered that he is no longer interested in taking up arms and 
living in the bush as a guerrilla. 
  "I am a politician," he said, "and I am only concerned with 
organizing my party." 
  He added: "We do not need to hide weapons. If you could 
enter my heart, you would know." Amid journalists' doubts he 
said: "I am speaking from the bottom of my heart." 
  The leader of the former rebel movement said he does not 
want 
war any more. He said in Rome on 4 October 1992 that he avowed 
in his speech during the signing of the General Peace Accord 
that he would never again resume war in Mozambique. Now, he 
said, his major weapon "is the Mozambican people who will defeat 
the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] if it resorts to war." 
  "I would like to see the problem of soldiers resolved as 
soon 
as possible. I would like to see them confined and demobilized 
as soon as possible," Dhlakama said, recalling that he is now 
the president of a party that has placed aside the military 
option. 
  In a meeting with journalists at his residence in Maputo, 
the Renamo leader said his party will not demand money as a 
precondition for taking part in the election. "We need money 
for the election but that is not the most important thing," he 
said. Dhlakama said Renamo only needs money to buy fuel for its 
vehicles, to buy typewriters and paper, to pay telephone bills 
and so on. 
  Regarding areas previously under the control of his 
movement, 
Dhlakama said their nonintegration in state administration so 
far is an act of sabotage by the government. "The government no 
longer needs those areas because it thinks the people living 
there may not be ready to vote for Frelimo." 
  Afonso Dhlakama worked with his cadres in Inhambane and Gaza 
this week, preparing for the electoral campaign.

  [Text] The process of confining and demobilizing troops 
from the government and the Mozambique National Resistance 
[Renamo] continues slowly. According to figures supplied by the 
UN Operations in Mozambique, over the past two days the 
government only confined 421 troops, while Renamo confined 
seven. During the same period, the government demobilized 373 
soldiers, while Renamo demobilized 264 soldiers. So far, the 
government has demobilized about 19,000 troops, while Renamo has 
demobilized more than 3,000. The government still has to 
demobilize about 49 [figure as heard] soldiers and Renamo about 
6,000. International members of the Supervision and Control 
Commission [CSC] in Maputo have expressed the fear that the 
government may not conclude the confinement and demobilization 
of its troops within the deadline.

  [Text] The international members of the Supervision and 
Control Commission [CSC] said in Maputo yesterday that they were 
worried about the possibility of the government not being able 
to complete the confinement and demobilization of its troops 
within the timetable that it agreed to fulfill. A communique 
received in our newsroom says the timetable already represents a 
one-month delay in relation to the dates set by the May 1994 UN 
Security Council resolution. The international members of the 
CSC noted that between 14 and 21 June only 821 men reported to 
government assembly points. Taking into account the personnel 
involved, the joint communique said 11,448 troops still need to 
report to the assembly points. The deadline for the confinement 
and demobilization of troops expires on 30 June.

  [Text] Aldo Ajello, UN secretary general representative in 
Mozambique, is still worried about the slowness in confinement 
of government and Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] 
troops. He said only 655 soldiers have been confined this week, 
a figure which he described as marginal considering that to 
comply with its plan the government should demobilize 1,500 
soldiers per day until 1 July. Aldo Ajello said the government 
pledged to comply with the timetable, though he believes he 
ought to meet the president of the Republic to discuss the issue 
and find satisfactory and realistic solutions. The meeting 
should take place before Chissano leaves for Lisbon where 
Lusophone countries are scheduled to hold a conference. 
  Aldo Ajello said 2,427 soldiers from both sides were 
demobilized this week. It has been estimated that 4,076 
soldiers from both sides will be demobilized next week. 
  He said the 13,776 government soldiers demobilized before 
the 
signing of the peace accord will receive demobilization 
allowances. As of 29 June, they should report to the 
Reintegration Commission [Core] to be registered. At a meeting 
yesterday, the Supervision and Control Commission ratified the 
plan to assist in the reintegration of demobilized soldiers. 
  The plan provides for a minimum income for demobilized 
troops 
to encourage the latter to live in areas of their choice, 
thereby restricting migration into cities. The plan is also 
designed to supplement any other schemes adopted by Core to 
assist demobilized troops with means other than financial ones. 
  The reintegration scheme includes a financial plan that 
provides for fixed monthly payments in local currency over a 
18-month period. Payments will begin three months after 
demobilization and will cover 69,140 government and Renamo 
troops. 
  The overall cost of the scheme has been estimated at 
$19,032,580. The governments of Denmark, FRG, Italy, The 
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and of Switzerland 
have contributed to that fund. 
  Ajello said he was pleased with the Mozambican Government's 
decision to pay pensions to Renamo troops maimed during the war, 
noting that that is a significant sign of national 
reconciliation. He said government teams, with UN Operations in 
Mozambique logistical assistance, have already begun operating 
in centers for war-maimed soldiers.

  [Excerpts] In northern Nampula Province, Islam has been 
experiencing an unprecedented crisis over the past few years. 
It is now clear that there is division among its followers. 
There are three leading sects -- namely, the Mozambique Islamic 
Congress, the Mozambique Islamic Council, and the Muhammadan 
Association (Sunni sect). [passage omitted] 
  Leading Islamic figures in the Isle of Mozambique and in the 
port city of Nacala say: "We are being invaded by Islamic 
fundamentalism. The whole world knows the signs of it, notably 
those relating to radicalism which leads to violence." 
  They made an accusation: "It is the Sudanese who have been 
introducing Islamic fundamentalism here in Nacala and in the 
Isle of Mozambique..." 
  We asked [Mozambique Islamic Council member] Habibo Amade 
for 
an explanation. 
  He said: "As a matter of fact the danger lies in that 
interpretation because it has been fabricated in the West. We 
ought to be very careful and realize that right now, in line 
with what has been reported in the Western press, Islam is 
regarded in the West as more dangerous because communism is no 
longer around. So, there will be new fabrications and subtly 
they will try to infiltrate us." 
  "Why would the West be so interested in, so to speak, 
overthrowing or even weakening Islam?" 
  "The example from Bosnia is more than clear about that. Now 
that there is an arms embargo, the West is doing its best to 
prevent those people from defending themselves because they do 
not want the establishment of an Islamic state in that part of 
the world. They say it is a violent society and make other 
accusations like the ones about Iran, Algeria, and other Islamic 
countries." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Christo Retief] </F>
  [Excerpts] An explosive situation exists in eastern Caprivi 
after details surfaced of an incident involving a strange armed 
force supported by an attack helicopter of unknown origin, which 
apparently attempted to terrorize the Mafwe chief at Linyanti. 
The household of Chief Bonniface Mamili, on the banks of the 
Linyanti River, which forms the border between Namibia and 
Botswana, was allegedly held captive for several hours by armed 
men combing the surrounding areas in search of members of the 
Angolan resistance movement, UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola], while a helicopter equipped with 
weapons circled over the tribal settlement. The president of 
the DTA [Democratic Turnhalle Alliance] in Namibia, Mr. Mishake 
Muyongo, who is presently visiting the eastern Caprivi, 
yesterday described the incident as sufficient proof of SWAPO's 
[South-West African People's Organization] secret missions to 
intimidate political opponents and to fuel chaos in Caprivi 
where SWAPO currently enjoys no political support. 
  Yesterday the Namibian police strongly denied any 
allegations 
of police and army involvement in the alleged incident and 
confirmed that the incident is being investigated at the highest 
level. According to government sources, Minister of Home Affairs 
Lucas Pohamba and Police Inspector General General Raonga Andima 
was kept fully informed yesterday about developments during the 
joint investigation by police, the Intelligence Service, and the 
Defense Force. Yesterday DIE REPUBLIKEIN could not succeed in 
independently confirming the incident but inhabitants and 
community leaders in Katima Mulilo suggested that members of the 
Botswana Defense Force stationed at the Chobe National Park, or 
even a reconnaissance and fighter unit of the MPLA [Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola] army in Angola, could be 
responsible for the incident. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Muyongo said that according to preliminary information 
at 
his disposal, a secret informant of SWAPO notified the police at 
Katima Mulilo that members of UNITA were hiding in the vicinity 
of the chief's residence. In reaction to this information a 
helicopter and at least three land cruiser vehicles full of 
armed "policemen" were sent to the town. The men in the 
vehicles searched the bush around Mr. Mamili's residence in 
military formation after a helicopter circled the house. After 
the unsuccessful search they disappeared and nothing was heard 
from them since. [passage omitted] 
  Inhabitants of Katima Mulilo said yesterday that the 
Botswana 
Air Force operating from the Kasane Airport near Linyanti often 
violates Namibian borders and that these violations are usually 
accompanied by patrols into Caprivi from the Chobe Nature 
Reserve. According to these inhabitants, high-level talks 
recently took place between senior officers of the Namibian 
Police, the Defense Force, and Intelligence, with their 
counterparts from Botswana. The assistant to the secretary 
general of the police, General Martin Pool, yesterday confirmed 
these talks, adding that the group of officers made use of a 
Botswana Air Force helicopter in their investigation. He 
strongly denied, however, that the helicopter entered Namibian 
airspace. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Officials of Region Five [Ethiopian Somali 
region] have noted that with the exception of the prevailing 
natural and man-made drought in the area, peace is prevailing in 
the whole area and the people are leading their lives 
peacefully. The officials, when briefing Prime Minister Tamirat 
Layne who is currently visiting the region, said that what some 
(?newspapers) had related about the region is baseless. Mr. 
Tamirat who met the officials of the Region in Jijiga said that 
a joint effort by the people, their representatives and the 
government was required in order to combat the prevailing 
drought in the region. Teferi Legese has the details. 
  [Begin Teferi recording] During the meeting, the officials 
of 
the region briefed Mr. Tamirat about the prevailing problems in 
the region. [passage omitted] The officials noted that the 
Ethiopian Somalis are trying their best to maintain peace and 
stability in their areas and that in fact, they are at present 
leading their lives peacefully and maintaining peace in the 
region in collaboration with the transitional government's Army. 
What some private newspapers have been saying about the region 
is therefore baseless. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Tamirat, on his part, said that joint efforts have to be 
made by the government, the region's officials, people and 
various nongovernmental organizations in order to combat the 
prevailing problems. [passage omitted] 
  Regarding the security of the region, the prime minister 
said 
that those who are saying there is no peace in the region can 
say whatever they want, but you [the officials] should strive to 
solve people's problems. [end recording]

following congratulatory message to His Excellency President 
Francois Mitterrand of the French Republic which reads: 
  Mr. President and dear friend, 
  We have learned with great satisfaction the French 
Government's historic decision to dispatch troops to Rwanda to 
provide humanitarian aid and to ensure peace there after the 
two-month-old massacres resulting from the ethnic war in that 
African country. This decision, Mr. President, is not at all 
surprising to my government as it is in response to the 
imperative need to preserve international peace as advocated by 
the United Nations, whose (?fundamental) principles have always 
been France's objective. 
  I would like to express to your excellency my government's 
unflinching support for and solidarity with the French 
Government in its efforts to save human lives in Rwanda. This 
initiative should be supported unconditionally by the entire 
international community. 
  Please accept, Mr. President and dear friend, the expression 
of my sincerest support and solidarity as well as my kindest

  [Text] Kigali, 24 Jun (AFP) -- Rebel and Army gunners 
pounded Kigali overnight and sporadic fighting continued early 
Friday [24 June] as United Nations forces prepared to evacuate 
hundreds of displaced people from the airport, a UN spokesman 
said. 
  "The fighting was very intense last night," UN military 
spokesman Jean-Guy Plante told AFP by telephone from Kigali. 
"There was a lot of heavy mortar and machine-gun fire. It's 
still going on this morning but it's sporadic." 
  Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels are pressing their 
offensive to flush remaining government soldiers out of the 
capital Kigali, apparently fearing that French troops may 
forestall an all-out victory by the rebels who control about 
two-thirds of the small central African country. 
  Major Plante said UN troops had established radio contact 
late Thursday with French forces that arrived in western Rwanda 
on Thursday in the first stage of a military intervention to 
stem ethnic bloodletting. He said UN commander General Romeo 
Dallaire planned to meet Army chief of staff General Augustin 
Bizimungu later Friday to discuss the French military 
intervention and the future UN role in Rwanda.

  [Excerpts] French troops have launched their operation to 
save the people threatened with massacre in Rwanda, from their 
rear base on the border in Zairian territory. On the line, 
right away, we have our special correspondents on the French 
side and in the heart of the Rwandan capital, Kigali. 
Furthermore, the only journalist on the spot there is the 
France-2 journalist, Laurent Boussie. [passage omitted] 
  I am now going to talk to the only journalist still in 
Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, Laurent Boussie. Laurent, you 
are in the heart of the country, in Kigali, and this morning a 
fearsome offensive is being carried out by the RPF [Rwandan 
Patriotic Front], the rebels, who clearly wish to take complete 
control of the city very rapidly. Laurent? 
  [Boussie] Yes, Daniel. Last night there was a very big 
offensive, a very big artillery barrage here in Kigali. The 
artillery barrage ended at about 0700 or 0730 this morning and 
the offensive appears to have resumed at about 1100. 
  At this time there is heavy fighting in the city. There is 
very heavy fighting around the Red Cross hospital, where all of 
the medical staff are sheltering. A shell even landed on the 
room where the wounded undergo triage. We have no news at this 
time of the number of people hurt, but it appears in fact -- and 
it is rare for an operation to be taking place in the middle of 
the day, for it to begin in the morning -- it appears that this 
is perhaps not the final assault, but in any case it is a very 
big offensive, only halted from time to time by the weariness of 
the men and the lack of ammunition, because the logistic 
channels for bringing in weapons are experiencing quite a lot of 
difficulty. 
  [Announcer] Laurent Boussie, you are in the company of the 
RPF forces, the RPF being the rebels who are opposed to French 
intervention. Have they referred to the beginning of the 
operation by the French forces? 
  [Boussie] This morning the RPF organized a demonstration -- 
there were about 2,500 people demonstrating against the French 
presence -- at which President Mitterrand was called a traitor, 
a killer, etc. So, you see, they are continuing to demonstrate. 
They are continuing to maintain the pressure against this 
French intervention, which they accuse of being aimed at aiding 
their enemies. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] On the ground in Goma, on the 
Zaire-Rwanda border, we have the first report from our 
correspondent, Nicolas Poincare: 
  [Begin Poincare recording] Operation Turquoise has begun. 
The first French forces are inside Rwanda, but the first 
mission that was due to be carried out today could not, in the 
end, go ahead. The first troops were due to enter Rwanda from 
Zaire to the south, to go to Cyangugu and set up a first 
protection zone. Here in Goma, on the Zairean side of the 
border, where the headquarters of Operation Turquoise have been 
set up, the soldiers now say they are ready for this mission. 
They are just waiting for the green light from Paris. This 
will probably be given tomorrow morning. Around 60 paratroopers 
and marine commandos will go to Cyangugu to protect Tutsi 
refugee camps. The Tutsis number some 8,000 in this region, 
under threat from the Hutu militias. 
  This will be a first intervention to show the RPF [Rwandan 
Patriotic Front] quite clearly that the French have come on a 
humanitarian mission. The soldiers will then try to expand 
their protection zone, but all this will take a lot of time. 
For now, Operation Turquoise is above all a logistical 
operation. Here in Goma, for example, only 150 men have 
actually arrived.

  [Excerpt] Zairian territory is serving as a base for French 
troops in Operation Turquoise, a mission that France has termed 
humanitarian and that it claims is aimed at saving the civilian 
population who are in danger of being exterminated. 
  The French units are based in Goma and Bukavu at the 
Zaire-Rwanda border, from where they have been making incursions 
into Rwandan territory since this afternoon. A third base is in 
Kisangani, where French Army planes are stationed. In all, 
2,500 troops have been mobilized today. A security corridor has 
been established from Goma to evacuate the 8,000 Rwandans 
trapped in (Assiengoungou). France has given assurances that 
its troops will not go as far as Kigali. According to French 
Defense Minister Francois Leotard, the mission is strictly a 
humanitarian and not a peacekeeping one. 
  The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], however, is opposed to 
the 
French intervention. The front says France is using Operation 
Turquoise as an alibi to give the Rwandan Army a helping hand. 
The Rwandan interim government thinks the French intervention 
should cover the entire territory. 
  According to a communique issued by the Rwandan Embassy in 
Kinshasa, the priority concerns for this humanitarian action 
should be to break the war trend which these hardened firebrands 
are bent on pursuing and ensure security conditions which would 
enable displaced people and war victims to get out of the mental 
and financial distress resulting from the continuation of 
hostilities, which RPF sponsors are staking on. 
  The communique further stated that it is absolutely urgent 
for Rwandans to get out of this tragedy and for the 
international community to get mobilized and respond effectively 
to the people's distress calls. It also stated that the 
cease-fire is constantly being violated by this indisciplined 
group under the command of officers who thirst for power and 
blood and who had moved up in rank in Uganda in the Army of, 
quote, the former rebel, Museveni. [no reference to closing 
quote as heard] [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] In the western part of Rwanda, 
which is under the control of the government forces, the arrival 
of the French is welcomed with satisfaction. Jean Helen met 
Jerome Bicamumpaka, the foreign minister of the Rwandan interim 
government, in Gisenyi: 
  [Begin recording] [Bicamumpaka] Our government praises the 
French initiative to mobilize the international community to 
form an expedition force whose aim is to protect the threatened 
Rwandan civilian population. We think that this operation falls 
in line with the aim of establishing peace in Rwanda and 
promoting a fair political compromise in Rwanda, which our 
government has been trying to achieve for two and a half months 
now. This operation will make an effective contribution to the 
efforts aimed at establishing peace in Rwanda as soon as 
possible. 
  If the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] once again refuses to 
budge and cooperate with this force, we think this force should 
have the means to make the RPF comply by force if necessary. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] That is to conduct itself as a 
buffer force or deploy itself in RPF zones? 
  [Bicamumpaka] This force should absolutely be able to deploy 
itself in both government and RPF zones because people under 
threat are not only in our zone, but also in large numbers in 
the RPF zone. [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  This intervention has given rise to mixed reactions in 
Burundi, the neighboring country. The Burundian Foreign 
Minister Jean-Marie Ngendahayo: 
  [Begin Ngendahayo recording] What its neighbor Burundi says 
is that peace should be established in Rwanda and massacres 
should be stopped. Concerning Operation Turquoise, Burundi has 
never been officially consulted, either by France or by the two 
belligerents. Now, in Burundi we say we have to observe strict 
neutrality, that is as long as the two belligerents do not agree 
on this French initiative, French troops and French military 
equipment will not be allowed to transit through Burundi. But 
we think that it is very important that everybody makes greater 
efforts for peace and humanitarian aid for the sake of the 
Rwandan people. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with RPF Chairman Alexis Kanyarengwe by </F>
corrspondent Emmanuel Mugunga "today"; place not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] After meeting Jean-Michel Marlaud, the French 
envoy to Rwanda, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] chairman, 
Alexis Kanyarengwe, today gave an interview to our colleague, 
Emmanuel Mugunga. Let us listen to the RPF chairman who starts 
by giving us his reasons for holding talks with the French envoy. 
  [Kanyarengwe] Indeed, I said last time that it was not 
necessary to receive the French delegation, given that the 
problems at hand were well known and that the RPF position on 
the current situation concerning France's intervention was very 
clear. However, this morning, I met the French envoy in Kigali, 
Mr. Marlaud to know exactly why he insisted on meeting me. 
  [Mugunga] What was the explanation? 
  [Kanyarwengwe] Well, during the meeting, he briefed us on 
his 
government's position concerning the French intervention in 
Rwanda: That it would be a purely humanitarian intervention and 
nothing to do with exerting power. He also sought to inform us 
about the decision of the UN Security Council authorizing the 
French intervention in Rwanda. In reply, I explained that even 
with the UN authorization for the French intervention, the 
French presence was not at all appreciated by the RPF, and we 
considered the presence of these troops a dangerous element for 
the security and the success of operations in our country. 
  [Mugunga] Did envoy Marlaud talk to you about the state of 
progress of the so-called humanitarian mission? 
  [Kanyarwengwe] In fact, a resolution was adopted at the 
Security Council in New York. And you know that even before the 
UN decision, France had already taken the initiative of 
preparing everything, placing all its equipment and troops in a 
country neighboring Rwanda. This means that the French 
operation was already ready at the border, despite our 
apprehensions which indeed persist. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Theogene Rudasingwa, secretary general of the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front, has had very harsh words for France's 
operation in Rwanda. John Maguire met him in Paris this morning 
and asked him what he thought of the UN's vote, giving the green 
light for Operation Turquoise: 
  [Begin Rudasingwa recording, in English with superimposed 
French translation] I do not think the UN decision reflects a 
consensus on the part of the international community, because in 
the post cold war era, to have five abstentions at the UN 
Security Council is very significant. 
  You also know that the OAU, the countries of the region, and 
many international organizations of excellent repute, strongly 
oppose this intervention. So, I think we have witnessed not a 
consensus, but rather the will of the northern powers to 
consolidate a program which counters the interests of our 
people, to save those very groups who are responsible for this 
genocide. These powers at present see that these groups are 
weakened and are losing ground. I think that not only France, 
but also other countries, in particular Zaire, are trying simply 
to see how they can reorganize these groups of people so as to 
give them a place in the future. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Mario Fiorito] </F>
  [Text] Kinshasa, June 23 (AFP) -- Rwanda's ethnic bloodbath 
has enabled Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko, ostracised for 
maintaining autocratic rule, to return to the international 
stage first as an African mediator and then as host a French 
military intervention. 
  The Zairean ruler, out of favour with Paris and his Belgian 
and American former allies for almost three years, was in 
mid-June chosen by his African peers to try and mediate an end 
to Rwanda's strife and this week became crucial to French plans 
for military humanitarian intervention. 
  A ceasefire was negotiated under Marshal Mobutu's auspices 
between Rwanda's Hutu majority government and the mainly Tutsi 
rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) at the annual summit 
of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in Tunis earlier this 
month. 
  The pact did not hold, but France's decision to launch a 
humanitarian military operation from Thursday [23 June] to 
protect ethnic Tutsis at risk of massacre in government-held 
western Rwanda gave Mobutu a second chance to come to the fore. 
  In the face of opposition from the RPF, which accuses Paris 
of propping up successive Hutu regimes in Kigali, the lukewarm 
approval given Wednesday by the UN Security Council to the 
French operation, launched from Zairean territory, amounts to 
recognition of the role the elderly African ruler still has to 
play. 
  It entitles Mobutu to claim that without him as head of 
state, despite the political chaos and economic turmoil reigning 
in his country, the despatch to eastern Zaire of hundreds of 
French troops and Jaguar fighter-bombers would not have been so 
easily negotiated. 
  Paris, which had placed restrictions on Mobutu and his 
family 
and aides to increase pressure for democracy, will now find it 
more difficult to stop him "having his teeth seen to" at his 
residence in Cap-Martin in southern France, a Zairean politician 
joked Thursday. 
  After serious rioting and looting broke out in September 
1991 
in Zaire, leading to an exodus of thousands of expatriates, 
Mobutu was several times refused authorisation to go to France. 
  The radical opposition to the veteran leader, hostile to 
French intervention in Rwanda, will find in Operation Turquoise 
further grist to the mill of its criticism of France, often 
denounced as "Mobutu's accomplice." 
  Anti-French sentiment, strong among those close to Mobutu's 
main rival, Etienne Tshisekedi, who claims to be the country's 
prime minister though the head of state has sacked him, seems 
set to grow. In Kinshasa particularly, Tshisekedi is regarded as 
the charismatic head of the opposition to "dictatorship". 
  The presence of French troops in the vast central African 
nation, some Zairean politicians say in private, is proof of the 
"ambiguity" and successive changes in Paris's policy regarding 
Zaire. 
  "After denouncing Mobutu, in 1991 and in 1993 (following a 
mutiny by troops), France is behaving as if it were at home 
here," one political source said. "Who gave France the green 
light to station troops on our soil and who was asked for the 
authorisation?"

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Up to 150 Zairian parliamentarians have decided to 
end the seven-week boycott of the Assembly. They originally 
walked out in protest at attempts to sideline opposition leader 
Etienne Tshisekedi, who claims to be prime minister. But, last 
week, the parliament chose Kengo Wa Dondo as prime minister, and 
on the face of it Etienne Tshisekedi is out in the cold. On the 
line to Brussels, Chris Greene asked Justine Kasavubu, 
spokeswoman for Tshisekedi's UDPS [Union for Democracy and 
Social Progress] party if the return of the deputies wasn't a 
slap in the face for Tshisekedi: 
  [Begin recording] [Kasavubu] No, no, not at all, not at all. 
You are mistaken. I think you are totally wrong, no. If you 
can remember, the call Mr. Tshisekedi did about on the 5th of 
June for a general strike, it was a massive, a massive support 
in favor of this appeal for Mr. Tshisekedi. So, he still has 
the people on his side. 
  [Greene] But, he is isolated in parliament and the foreign 
donors are no longer interested in supporting him. 
  [Kasavubu] No, no, it is only Paris -- France -- who are 
still corrupting some of our politicians in order to, you know, 
push them and not to support Mr. Tshisekedi, but this doesn't 
come from the people of Zaire at all. 
  [Greene] But, inside, Kengo Wa Dondo must have been boosted 
by all these deputies deciding to return to Parliament. 
  [Kasavubu] No, I don't think so, and please give yourself 
some time in the coming weeks and you will see what will happen. 
I don't think that Kengo Wa Dondo or Mobutu now they can cry 
for victory. Just wait and see and you will see that the truth 
is on Mr. Tshisekedi's side. 
  [Greene] Can you give our listeners a preview of what is 
going to happen in the coming weeks? 
  [Kasavubu] Well, it is going to be more and more civil 
disobedience, boycott of French enterprises, and even Belgium -- 
if ever Belgium happens to change its position in favor of 
Mobutu. So, we think that we have no choice now, it is going to 
be resistance until we get this democratization process under 
way. [end recording]

  [Text] Cape Town June 24 SAPA -- Former Umkhonto we Sizwe 
[Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] intelligence chief Mr 
Ronnie Kasrils has been appointed deputy minister of defence, 
President Nelson Mandela announced on Friday [24 June]. He said 
in a statement that Defence Minister Mr Joe Modise had made 
representations to him about the need for additional senior 
personnel to run his ministry. 
  He had agreed to the request after taking into account the 
important role of the SANDF [South African National Defense 
Force] and the challenges it faced in the vital process of 
integrating the different armed forces. 
  Mr Mandela said Mr Kasrils had experience in military 
affairs 
as a leading officer of Umkhonto we Sizwe. 
  His experience, expertise and skills enabled him to play an 
important role in the defence subcouncil of the Transitional 
Executive Council. 
  "I am confident that he will do the same in his new role as 
deputy minister of defence," he said. 
  Mr Kasrils' appointment brings the total number of deputy 
ministers to 13. 
  He became a member of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) on its creation 
and carried out acts of sabotage before being sent abroad for 
military training. 
  After several years in the ANC office in Dar es Salaam Mr 
Kasrils and his wife Eleanor moved to London where he worked to 
establish underground MK units in South Africa. During this 
period he also co-wrote several books about the philosopher and 
socialist Bertrand Russell. 
  In 1977 Mr Kasrils moved to Angola to become political 
instructor in the MK camps and later political commissar for 
Angola. 
  He was based in Lusaka between 1985 and 1989. He was chief 
of 
military intelligence from 1983-1988 and was a co-opted member 
of the National Executive Committee from 1987. 
  When he returned illegally to the country at the end of 
1989, 
Mr Kasrils was hunted by the security forces for his role in 
Operation Vula and repeatedly escaped arrest before being 
indemnified in June 1991. He was elected to the NEC [National 
Executive Committee] and the National Working Committee and the 
Political Bureau of the SACP [South African Communist Party]. 
  Kasrils' autobiography "Armed and Dangerous: My Undercover 
Struggle Against Apartheid" was published earlier this year.

<F P=106> [By Sylvia du Plessis] </F>
  [Text] Revenue: The total consolidated estimate of revenue 
for the National Revenue Account is R105.8bn [rand], 11.2 
percent above the comparable figure for 1993/94. This figure 
includes all revenue at national and regional level. 
  Expenditure: The estimate of total expenditure from the 
National Revenue Account is R135.1bn, up 10.2 percent form 
1993/94. This now covers all spending at national and regional 
level, except that financed from the former regional 
administrations' own revenues. It includes the R4bn for the 
transition. 
  Finance: The final consolidated Budget deficit will be 
R29.3bn or 6.6 percent of GDP [gross domestic product]. This 
compares with last year's 6.9 percent. Loan redemptions will be 
about R6.9bn, lifting the gross borrowing requirements to 
R36.5bn. Government intends to finance this mainly through 
domestic loans of R34.513bn. Foreign borrowings of R1.8bn are 
planned. 
  Reconstruction and Development: An amount of R2.5bn was 
allocated to the RDP [Reconstruction and Development Program] 
fund, rising to R5bn, R7.5bn, R10bn and R12.5bn over the next 
four years. The initial finance was raised by cuts in 
departments' budgets. 
  Tax Proposals: Individual tax rates remain unchanged, but 
there is a transition levy of 5 percent on individuals with 
taxable income above R50,000, or R175,000 in the case of married 
women. 

  -  Companies with taxable income in excess of R50,000 are 
also liable for the transition levy at a rate of 5 percent. 
  -  The corporate tax rate falls to 35 percent from 40 percent 
from 
April 1994, but STC [secondary tax on companies] will be raised 
to 25 percent from 15 percent with immediate effect. 


    VAT [value-added tax]: Remains unchanged at 14 percent. 
  Customs and Excise: 

  -  The price of a 340ml can of beer rises by 2c (6c/1). 
  -  Spirits rise by 53c a 750ml bottle. 
  -  Cigarettes increase by 7c for 10. 
  -  Cigarette tobacco increases by 9c per 50g. 
  -  Pipe tobacco and cigars increase by 65c per kg. 
  -  Unfortified wine rises 4.5c per 750ml bottle. 
  -  Fortified wine increases 5c per 750ml bottle. 
  -  Sparkling wine rises 6c per ?50ml bottle. 
  -  Other fermented drinks such as cider rise 2c per 340ml can. 
  -  Sorghum beer increases 1c/l. 
  -  Sorghum beer powder rises 5c/kg. 
  -  Cold drinks and mineral water increase by 1c/l. 


    Import Surcharge: The 5 percent imp?rt surcharge on all 
capital and intermediate goods will be removed with immediate 
effect. 
  Pensions: 

  -  Civil pensions rise by 5 percent from April 1 1994 for 
pensioners who retired or before July 1 1993; those who retired 
later but before April 1 1994 receive a 0.56 percent increase 
for each full month since retirement. 
  -  Pensions which have increased since retirement by a 
percentage 
which, after taking into account the increase above, does not 
equal 70 percent of the increase in the CPI [consumer price 
index] since retirement, will be increased to that level. 
  -  Military pensions will rise by 5.6 percent from April 1 1994. 
  -  About R418m is made available for a general social pensions 
increase and the elimination of backlogs. 


    Job Creation: R292m is allocated to job creation, excluding 
allocations from the RDP fund. However, the figure mainly 
represents a rollover by the Manpower Department.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Derek Keys, in the Cape </F>
Town studio, by SABC announcer Max du Preez, WEEKEND STAR 
correspondent Magnus Heysteck, and BEELD economic correspondent 
Curt von Keyserlingk in the Johannesburg studio, on 22 June; 
from the "Agenda" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Du Preez] Good evening and welcome to Agenda. This 
is where we provide the background to the day's news. After 
days of speculation, the government of national unity's first 
budget was announced today. For some it brought good news, but 
for others, definitely not. Earlier, together with two of my 
colleagues in the media world, we spoke to the minister of 
finance, Mr. Derek Keys, on the budget and its consequences. 
With me I have two senior correspondents in the business world, 
Magnus Heysteck from the WEEKEND STAR and Curt von Keyserlingk 
from BEELD. Minister Keys is in Cape Town. Good evening, Mr. 
Keys. 
  [Keys] Good evening, Max. 
  [Du Preez] Mr. Keys, let us begin. My first impression when 
I listened to you this afternoon is that the more things appear 
to change, the more they really stay the same. This is not 
exactly a budget catering for reconstruction. It is not really 
a budget for the poor, is it? 
  [Keys] Of course, it is. There is a large contribution 
towards the Reconstruction and Development Program [RDP]. 
  [First correspondent] Mr. Keys, I do not completely agree 
with Max du Preez. The South African taxpayer is among the most 
heavily taxed in the world. In the past it was said that 
attempts would be made to lower its taxes, in other words to 
lower direct taxation and to increase indirect taxation. Now 
you went in the opposite direction with the financing of the 
RDP...[pauses] of the transitional costs. Why? 
  [Keys] Well, this is an exceptional opportunity, something 
we 
have to deal with once and put behind us. The biggest factor I 
had to contend with was to maintain a healthy structure -- to 
try to accommodate the one-off tax. 
  [First correspondent] But would it not have been better to 
raise revenue though privatization? It is a very healthy 
principle. Throughout the world the emphasis is on 
privatization, even in socialist countries. Why do we not 
privatize, then the taxpayer would not have more burdens placed 
on him? 
  [Keys] Yes, well there are arguments in favor of this and 
there are arguments against. A few of my colleagues have stated 
their opposition to this in the last few weeks. There are 
certain reasons they consider it unwise to privatize at this 
moment. This was not a practical option for me. 
  [Du Preez] Mr. Keys, could I just come in quickly. There has 
been an increase in the defense budget. Why is that? 
  [Keys] Yes, the defense budget is up because it includes a 
large part of the transitional costs, so in other words it is 
just a problem of the transitional costs reflected there. 
  [Second correspondent] Minister, tell us a little more about 
the Katz Committee you have just appointed. What are their 
orders? What are they going to look at? 
  [Keys] Yes, they have a very wide task. One cannot exactly 
restrict experts of that caliber. One should give them the 
widest possible freedom of movement and this they do have. All 
that we have asked them is -- to the extent that their 
recommendations are applicable to the next budget -- they should 
please give us those recommendations towards the end of November 
this year. Thereafter, we will publicize it and then we will 
accept public comment, and then decide in February '95 what 
changes we want to make to the structure. 
  [Second correspondent] Will they, for example, look at 
aspects like retirement planning, which is an uncertain stage 
for many people? 
  [Keys] Yes, they are not prevented from doing this. In terms 
of their brief there is a very wide clause, which almost says 
that anything else they think they want to make recommendations 
on, they should be allowed to do so. That is not excluded. I 
am not sure if they would want to tackle that issue in this 
commission. 
  [Du Preez] Minister, the last few years the general 
complaint 
by the ordinary taxpayer like me has been, that if each of us, 
the ordinary PAYE [pay as you earn] people, if each of us 
employs a tax lawyer then the state income will shrink 
considerably, because the wealthy already have the lawyers. 
Will this problem be addressed in the new South Africa? 
  [Keys] I think we have been addressing this now for a number 
of years. We had a situation that was totally unacceptable, 
with schemes -- I think the schemes concerning film production 
was the scheme that attracted a lot of attention -- and that 
sort of approach towards tax commitments, etc, was totally 
unacceptable. We did a lot of work over the last few years to 
remove those schemes. We have progressed well, and throughout we 
are attempting to put in place the simplest possible system. 
The reason for this is that the more complicated your systems 
get the more opportunities you create for these tax engineers 
who were so successful in the past. 
  [First correspondent] Minister, you said that the additional 
tax is a one-off levy, and you promised that it would not be 
continued. Now your predecessor also said a few years ago that 
the tax on imports would be phased out, and today you said that 
this would also be referred to this commission. This means that 
this is also in the balance. You also spoke about the RDP. It 
seems that there is 8 billion per year, it seems that much will 
be spent annually on the RDP. Where will this come from? Will 
it not come from this tax increase? 
  [Keys] No, the 8 billion is probably the average you have 
taken from this increase in contribution. 
  [First correspondent] Yes, that is so. 
  [Keys] No, this will come from the current level of 
expenditure from the various departments, and since we have a 
long period in which to plan this -- the canceling of funds is 
equal to about 3 percent of expenditure -- it is a very 
practical objective. So this will take place. As far as the 
surcharge is concerned, if I can just answer that question -- 
the reason we left the surcharge on consumer goods, is that if 
you ask a commission to look into the issue of VAT [value-added 
tax], which is imposed to a large extent on consumer goods, and 
where the possibility exists that they could encounter different 
rates on different types of goods, then it is better that they 
also -- concerning the effect of the surcharge on the same type 
of goods -- that they also take that into account. 
  [Second correspondent] Minister, there was a lot of 
speculation that you might have referred to the abolishing of 
the financial rand. You did not refer to it. That is my first 
question. 
  [Keys] I did mention it briefly. 
  [Second correspondent] What is the government's program in 
connection with this? 
  [Keys] The government's program is exactly the same as it 
was a year ago when the president of the Reserve Bank spelt out 
his guarantees, and they are simple: The margin between the two 
types of rands must be narrowed. The finrand's balance in the 
banking system must be narrowed, and the Reserve Bank must have 
certain methods, in the form of foreign reserves, enabling it to 
organize bridging finance. These three guarantees are healthy, 
they are still valid, and our policy is to stay within the 
framework of those three guarantees. 
  [Second correspondent] A second question in connection with 
interest rates. The budget is somewhat surprising in the manner 
in which the budget deficit will be financed. What is your 
opinion about a possible lowering of interest rates seen against 
the background of the relatively low inflation rate and low 
pressure on state finances? 
  [Keys] Well, naturally if one speaks only of our internal 
factors then I would say there should be a slight decrease in 
the interest rate -- the long-term rate -- but we should also 
take into account that we are already part of the international 
world, and in the international world as you well know, the 
interest rates increase in different countries. We cannot 
remain immune as far as those tendencies are concerned, so it is 
very difficult to determine which of those two tendencies will 
actually affect us more. 
  [Second correspondent] A final question, Minister. The 
foreign exchange markets are characterized by a weakening 
dollar, but despite this the rand is terribly weak against the 
British pound and the American dollar. What is the reason for 
this sudden weakening in our currency? 
  [Keys] Well, it is not that sudden. There has been a steady 
decline now for the past few years. There is a basic underlying 
reason -- that is, that for years we have had a higher rate of 
inflation than our trading partners, and this is still true 
today although the difference is, of course, much smaller. That 
is the underlying reason, but added to this there has been a lot 
of speculative activity affecting us, and this has increased in 
the course of the last few years. Those two factors together 
have had this effect. 
  [First correspondent] Minister, if I can come back to the 
Reconstruction and Development Program. It seems as if you said 
-- well, you did not actually say this -- but it seems as if you 
do not want to increase taxes to finance this. This will mean 
then that it will be financed mainly from savings in state 
expenditure. Now state expenditure to a large extent concerns 
loans for state officials. What are your expectations of the 
total number of people in the civil service over the past three, 
four, or five years? Do you think there will be a decline, or 
as is the case in the Department of Defense, it will increase? 
  [Keys] Do you mean... 
  [First correspondent, interrupting] The number of people in 
the civil service. 
  [Keys] I think one must bear in mind that in the program 
managed by Minister Naidoo that there is no question of him 
developing a bureaucracy of his own. In other words, that money 
will be applied in different directions and it could be that the 
current state departments, in many instances, will have to play 
a larger role in this respect. So, while they have to cut down 
on existing, or normal, or routine activities, there will be 
some developments. It is not as if we are going to decrease the 
total expenditure in those two programs together. The total of 
the two programs together, from the RDP and from the normal 
departmental expenditure, will stay the same. As long as there 
is a reasonable measure of flexibility among the personnel, I 
see every possible chance that through reallocation of personnel 
the problem will not be very big. Then one should also take 
into account that we are talking here of an annual decrease of 3 
percent of the total rate. 
  [Du Preez] Can I ask you a general question? Years back in 
the apartheid era we had the expectation that when apartheid was 
dismantled our bureaucracy would be reduced, we would reduce 
wastage because we would not have homelands. Could you tell us 
at this stage if this will really happen or if we have created 
new bureaucracies with the provinces, and will our civil service 
waste just as much money as before? 
  [Keys, laughing] Without answering the allegations hidden in 
your question, I will just say that we are replacing 17 
administrations with a total of 10. I think the nine provinces 
will operate more effectively and efficiently as was the case 
with the old ones, and their relationship with the central 
government will be a healthier one. All the civil servants in 
the provinces are also members of the same public service who 
will lighten the load of management to a great extent. There is 
every reason to believe that the new system will be much more 
effective. 
  Having said this, I do not want to hide the fact that there 
could be transitional problems, where for a while people will 
have to sit with other administrations and where they will only 
be absorbed slowly as time goes by, in compliance with the new 
administration. So in the short-term it may be true that there 
may be a certain measure of ineffective management, but 
long-term I am hopeful that this will not be the case. 
  [First correspondent] Minister, you have made an interesting 
comment in your budget speech, that the needy should not look to 
the budget for assistance but to the RDP. That is an 
interesting statement. When can the destitute look forward to 
assistance from this RDP? 
  [Keys] Well, this can begin immediately through the 
announcements made by the president in his opening debate in 
Parliament. He announced the feeding scheme for schools, 
medical services for certain classes of the needy, etc. So the 
process has already begun, but it is true that assistance to the 
poor will actually have to come from the expenditure side of the 
budget. You cannot help a person not paying tax by giving them 
tax concessions. 
  [Second correspondent] Minister, as you well know, in every 
other country it was proven that indirect taxation is a more 
effective way of collecting revenue. Now I know that there are 
political objections to this but in the future, if tax has to be 
increased, do you think it will be direct tax increases or 
indirect tax increases? 
  [Keys] Well, it is of course a hypothetical question. You 
must remember that the current interest rates, the current 
structure, did bring about a smaller deficit. So in other words 
it is actually very healthy. If we can control the expenditure 
side of it then it will remain healthy. So the chances that we 
will need it is small and we must keep it small. When it comes 
to a choice between the systems of taxation -- these we 
exercised last year already. You remember the VAT rate was 
earlier at 10 [percent]. We put it at 14 because of the reasons 
you mention. 
  [Du Preez] Could I quickly ask you, in terms of the 
corporate 
tax rate being reduced by 5 percent, is it not something of a 
surprise element? 
  [Keys] Well, it is something that worked very well last 
year. 
We noticed that the lowering of the rate from 48 to 40 had a 
very good effect. We are taking it now, if I can put it this 
way, to its limit, or rather, to its eventual resting place at 
35, with the dividend calculated rate at 25. We think it will 
work well. It's very good for smaller companies and for new 
companies and it helps any company wanting to reinvest it 
profits. 
  [Second correspondent] Minister, in relation to that 
question, what do you think foreign reaction will be to your 
budget? 
  [Keys] Well, I think that as far as one can make predictions 
on market developments and so forth, I think that the general 
approach and reaction will be favorable, but there is a measure 
of skepticism. The president spoke about getting rid of 
Afro-pessimism, and I want to add to that Afro-skepticism, a 
very widespread occurrence. We should not expect everything we 
say and do to have an immediate effect. 
  [Du Preez] Minister Keys, in Cape Town. Than you very much. 
Colleagues, thank you for your time.

  [Text] The Joint Standing Committee on Finance has 
questioned the government's assurance that the 5 percent levy on 
incomes over 50,000 rands a year will be a once-off deduction. 
  The minister of finance, Mr. Derek Keys, announced in his 
budget speech that the levy would be used to cover the costs of 
the Transitional Executive Council and the Independent Electoral 
Commission. However, Mr. Ken Andrew of the Democratic Party 
pointed out that next year's municipal elections would probably 
cost more than the national and provincial elections. The 
possibility of a referendum in certain provinces could also 
[not] be excluded. 
  Earlier, Mr. Keys named the members of the commission that 
is 
to review South Africa's tax structure and make recommendations 
on improving it. The commission will be headed by Professor 
Michael Katz, who also heads the Tax Advisory Committee. Other 
members are Professor Dennis Davis, Dr. J. de Villiers Graaff, 
Mr. P. du Toit, Professor P. More, and Miss (D. Moktatle), and 
Mr. J. Njeke. Mr. Keys announced the formation of the 
commission in making his budget speech yesterday. 
  The commission will examine personal income tax, corporate 
tax, VAT [value-added tax] and the income of the tax system on 
small business, savings, investment, foreign finance, and 
collection. Mr. Keys told this Joint Standing Committee on 
Finance that it was in South Africa's best interest to continue 
the Mossgas [Mossel Bay Gas] project. He said that not only did 
the state have major investments in the project but it also 
created job opportunities and was responsible for savings in 
foreign exchange. 
  Mr. Billy Nair of the ANC noted that the government had 
spent 
about 3,000 million rands on the project last year and that the 
work on the project was so specialized that it did not 
contribute significantly to creating job opportunities. He 
called for a viability study of the project.

  [Text] Parliament June 23 SAPA -- The Independent Electoral 
Commission [IEC] and the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] 
had had "an open cheque book" to fulfill their mandates, the 
director-general of state expenditure, Mr Hannes Smit, said on 
Thursday. Appearing before the Joint Standing Committee on 
Finance, he said both the IEC and TEC did not have budgets 
approved by Parliament, and therefore there was no over-spending 
on specific allocations. 
  Mr Smit was replying to a question by Mr David Graaff (NP) 
[National Party] on over-spending by the IEC and TEC. 
  He said the IEC, funded from the budget of the Department of 
Home Affairs, had received R119 million [rand] from the 1993/94 
budget and R128.5 million from the department's 1994/95 
allocation. 
  The IEC had then requested an additional R700 million, 
bringing its total allocation to R948.3 million. 
  The TEC had received R7.5 million from the 1993/94 home 
affairs budget and R8.4 million in 1994/95 -- a total of R15.9 
million.

<F P=106> [Interview with Trade and Industry Minister Trevor Manuel by </F>
SABC announcer Leslie Mashokwe in Cape Town; date not given; 
from the "Newsline" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Mashokwe] Do you think that this budget is really 
going to make you realize the dream of a better life for all 
South Africans? 
  [Manuel] It certainly provides a fairly important start. 
Where do you look? Firstly, the 2.5 billion rand which the 
president raised in his state of the nation address as a 
contribution towards the RDP [Research and Development Program] 
is a small sum. But within all of the budget, within each of 
the programs, certainly where I sit within trade and industry, 
what I need to do is to stimulate those areas that the RDP asks 
of me. Every budget line must be reexamined, and you've got to 
look at issues that relate to the quality of life of people. In 
that way we can address the RDP. 
  It's not going to happen in one year. It's certainly a 
process more than a single event. But I think we're well on the 
way. So clearly within the budget there's sufficient room to do 
that. Take account of the fact that to draw up a budget takes 
about 14 months. You've had your election just two months ago, 
and so all of the inputs aren't there, but within the big 
picture I think there's enough room. 
  There are certain things that we believe are important as 
well. You would have found that in the ANC election manifesto 
there were taxes for people earning less than 4,000 rand a 
month, would be one example. The very unfair burden placed on 
women, especially married women in respect of taxation would be 
another example. Now with this once-off levy to pay for the 
transition costs, and they were fairly high, you would find 
special relief for those two groups of people, so the terms are 
in place. 
  [Mashokwe] Let's look at one relief, one particular relief 
that we think ANC used very strongly -- zero rating on foods 
stuffs. Nothing is coming out of this budget in that regard, and 
one would have expected an ANC government to pioneer at least 
something along those lines? 
  [Manuel] Okay, clearly it is an omission for the moment. But 
in looking at the overall tax structure it's important that you 
don't just do things piecemeal. You don't want to zero-rate 
bread and add 2 percent on the price of the jam that will go on 
that bread. 
  And so the commission that was set up on taxation under the 
chairpersonship, Professor Michael Katz, is actually going to be 
important. All South Africans across the board can then make 
input into that commission. And that commission will advise 
government on a new system of taxation. 
  Overall it will take account of pay-as-you-earn, SITE 
[standard income tax on employees], corporate tax in the longer 
term sense, but certainly also VAT [value added tax]. It is 
important, and I say that unless democracy puts more food of a 
better quality on the tables of the majority of South Africans 
we wouldn't have achieved anything. So that is why the zero 
rating, increasing that basket of goods that could be zero 
rated, is an important issue. But it will come, and I'm sure 
that it would be announced even before the next budget. 
  [Mashokwe] The reason why I'm asking you this is because 
when 
you were not in government you were calling for the scrapping, 
the zero rating of foodstuffs, and now you're not saying 
anything about it. You're saying to me that it's coming? 
  [Manuel] I'm saying it's coming. I'm saying that it needs to 
be done in the context of complete revision of the tax structure 
that obtains -- that commission was announced today -- Michael 
Katz, Dennis Davis, a few other people on that commission, I 
think it will hear what South Africans want, and make the 
necessary input, so government can be advised on the new tax 
system. 
  [Mashokwe] You said earlier that where you sit in trade and 
industry, this budget is of importance. In what way? Import 
surcharge being canceled, what does that mean to me? 
  [Manuel] Well, it means a fair amount to any South African. 
Firstly, the way in which corporate tax, or company tax is now 
structured so that you have a reduction to 35 percent, and then 
the secondary tax on companies which effects dividends 
primarily, being increased, is an important signal to small and 
medium business people because they are the major beneficiaries 
out of this. 
  But what all South Africans need is an economy that grows, 
and clearly this is an investment budget. At a corporate rate 
of 35 percent, investments, new investments are encouraged, 
dividend pay-outs are not encouraged, and so more investment, 
more jobs, all of those issues become important. 
  [Mashokwe] What about reduction of tax on individuals, 
people 
who made an X next to ANC? 
  [Manuel] Yes, I'm saying that one would expect the terms of 
reference of the commission established on taxation to include 
issues of personal income tax.

  [Text] Johannesburg June 23 SAPA -- Fiscal discipline had 
to be balanced against the country's needs rather than the 
International Monetary Fund's prescriptions, the Congress of 
South African Trade Unions [COSATU] said on Thursday [23 June]. 
Reacting to Wednesday's budget, COSATU said in a statement the 
emphasis on fiscal discipline was one-sided. 
  "Fiscal discipline had been repeatedly raised as a virtue in 
itself, without the assurances that this would not be done at 
the expense of economic development or social justice," the 
statement said. 
  COSATU welcomed "without reservation" the five per cent 
transition levy saying it was "the first truly progressive 
taxation measure" which contributed to the aim of the 
Reconstruction and Development Programme. 
  On military spending, COSATU said it was difficult to accept 
that defence spending should increase from R9.3 billion [rand] 
to R10.6 billion in a reconstruction and development budget. 
"While we understand that certain costs have been incurred by 
the process of integration, a democratic South Africa which is 
at peace with the world cannot justify spending such huge sums 
on the military, including R1.5 billion on fighter aircraft. 
  "We are further alarmed to see that vast sums are being 
spent 
on para-military expenditure for the police. In a period when 
the emphasis should be shifting to community policing it is 
difficult to understand why half a billion rand has been 
allocated to buying armoured vehicles for the police." 
  COSATU added it supported the call for an urgent defence 
review, involving all sectors of society, to be completed before 
next year's budget.

<F P=106> [Interview with COSATU official Neil Coleman by reporter </F>
Carol Williams; place and date not given -- from the "Network 
Africa" program] 
  [Text] Now to South Africa where the ANC-led government has 
unveiled its first budget. There were few big surprises and as 
expected the emphasis was on social spending for education, 
housing, and welfare, as well as tax incentives for businesses. 
But with its proposals for a [words indistinct] wealth's tax, 
some have called it a Robin Hood budget -- taking from the rich 
to help the poor. Carol Williams spoke to Neil Coleman from 
COSATU, the Congress of South African Trade Unions, and asked 
him for the union's reaction to the budget. 
  [Begin recording] [Coleman] Well, you know, we are still 
studying it and looking at the full implications of the budget, 
but our initial response would be that it is a budget which lays 
the basis for the implementation of the Reconstruction and 
Development Program which COSATU and the trade unions were a 
very important part of designing. However, we have to recognize 
the fact that we are inheriting an apartheid bureaucracy and 
monetary amounts don't necessarily mean delivery. So, what we 
are already looking at are processes which will result in the 
restructuring of the public sector and ensure that the money in 
the budget actually results in delivery to the poorest 
communities which actually need the services. 
  [Williams] You mentioned that you quietly welcomed the 
budget, but there have been reports in some ANC grass roots 
circles that they are disappointed, that this budget (?isn't 
enough) to actually [words indistinct] apartheid. 
  [Coleman] What we are saying [words indistinct] to a tax 
system is that you have a 5 percent levy which is going to pay 
for the transition costs, but on the other hand there are 
certain areas which we believe could have been addressed better. 
For example, spending on defense has gone up from 9.3 billion 
to 10.6 billion [rand] and we don't believe that in a time of 
peace in which we are reconstructing our country that we can 
justify spending such a high amount on defense. We are calling 
for the government to engage in an urgent defense review. So, 
there are weaknesses in the budget, but for us the critical 
question is to make this bureaucracy, which is attempting to 
implement a reconstruction budget, to make that bureaucracy 
much, much more accountable and receptive to the needs of the 
public. 
  [Williams] And just how can the trade unions actually do 
that? 
  [Coleman] Well, I think we can do that in a number of ways. 
For a start, the problem that we are facing at the moment is 
that we have inherited a public service which is extremely 
stratified. At the bottom you have workers who are actually 
delivering the services, being paid poverty wages, while the 
bureaucrats who are delivering very little at all are getting 
paid fairly high wages. We want to look as a trade union 
movement at (?flexing) the hierarchies to ensure that the 
service delivered are actually remunerated fairly. We also want 
to ensure that we are part of the processes of restructuring 
those departments and making them more accountable to the public. 
  [Williams] I know COSATU and your trade unions have been 
very 
closely aligned to the ANC and also very instrumental in setting 
up its reconstruction program. Yet, this budget is a very, very 
business, corporate friendly budget. Do you think this is in 
any way going to affect your relationship with the present 
government? 
  [Coleman] Well, we are not against a budget which encourages 
investment, encourages business, but the question is at the end 
of the day for us to ensure that the business activity and the 
economic activity benefits everyone in the country and not just 
a privileged few. That is why, as I said, we would have liked 
to have seen much more emphasis on incentives to companies to 
create jobs, to engage in training, and in productive investment 
so that there would be some areas where we think too many 
concessions have been made. But on a whole it's quite a move 
away from the old apartheid South Africa where the only presence 
in the budget were the white minority and the business 
community. Here, clearly you have got the stamp of the majority 
beginning to imprint itself on the programs of government. [end

<F P=106> [By Sean Feely] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg June 24 SAPA -- The economy is unlikely 
to achieve a three per cent growth rate this year because of the 
five per cent transition levy announced in the budget, Standard 
Bank chief economist Nico Cyzpionka said Friday [24 June] in 
Johannesburg. 
  "The levy is going to undermine private consumption 
expenditure and will also have a negative impact on savings," he 
told a SA Chamber of Business [SACOB] seminar on the budget. 
  Standard Bank was therefore downscaling its projection of 
three per cent growth this year to a 2.5 per cent increase in 
real gross domestic product. 
  However, the outlook for the agricultural sector remained 
encouraging and due to the statistical calculation of GDP [Gross 
Domestic Product] the non-agricultural sector only had to 
increase by 0.5 per cent to achieve a three per cent growth rate. 
  Mr Cyzpionka said the budget, presented to Parliament on 
Wednesday by Finance Minister Derek Keys, was a credible effort 
to balance socio-economic development and fiscal discipline. 
  "It's not an add-on budget. They (the government) want to 
cut 
in order to spend elsewhere," he said. "Foreign investors were 
looking for a budget like this, but they're going to see how the 
domestic market reacts." 
  He said the raising of the R2.5-billion [rand] to fund the 
Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP] was admirable but 
warned the government could only perhaps squeeze departments on 
one further occassion. 
  The government plans to spend R40-billion on the RDP over 
the 
next five years and Mr Cyzpionka expressed concern those funds 
would be difficult to find. "You can snip-off from ordinary 
expenditure once, maybe twice, but not beyond that," he said. 
"The RDP expenditures are only feasible if economic activity 
increases and consequently lifts government revenue." 
  However, the budget was inflation neutral, avoiding an 
increase in value-added tax and easing manufacturing input costs 
due to the scrapping of the import surcharge on capital and 
intermediate goods. 
  Mr Cyzpionka said the budget may even push inflation down 
and 
once the Reserve Bank had likely shored up the reserve position 
in october, the Central Bank could cut its key rate by one per 
cent.

  [Text] Pretoria June 24 SAPA -- Members of the African 
National Congress serving in the government should set an 
example by disclosing their role in past acts of terror, nine 
former heads of the SA Police and SA Defence Force said in a 
statement on Friday [24 June]. In the statement issued on their 
behalf, former Police Commissioner Gen Mike Geldenhuys said 
certain principles needed to be followed if Justice Minister 
Dullah Omar was serious in his intention to expose the truth in 
the interests of reconciliation. 
  The first was that members of the ANC National Executive 
Committee, especially those serving in the government, set an 
example by disclosing their roles in the "planning, 
decision-making, policy, approval, instructions and acts which 
led to deeds of terror and death and mutilation of defenceless 
persons, including women and children". 
  Gen Geldenhuys said a second principle was that all parties 
and persons who were guilty of unlawful acts during the 
political struggle be dealt with "in all respects in the same 
way". 
  "The ANC and organisations which supported it cannot be 
excused on the grounds that they were conducting a so-called 
freedom struggle," the generals said. 
  Other principles included that basic justice should prevail 
and that the charter of fundamental human rights be upheld 
properly; that the activities of all organisations that played a 
role in undermining law and order and in promoting terrorism, as 
well as the misuse of funds collected for welfare purposes, be 
investigated; and that the police, defence force and national 
intelligence service disclose all available information and 
documentation they have in that regard. 
  Gen Geldenhuys said it was of vital importance that the 
advantages and disadvantages of the proposed truth commission 
and its contribution to the reconciliation process be considered 
carefully. 
  It needed to be questioned whether the consequences of the 
commission's investigations would bring about division, 
distrust, bitterness and the rejection of political leaders and 
the security forces. 
  The statement was issued by Gen Geldenhuys on behalf of 
Freedom Front Leader Gen Constand Viljoen and Generals J P Gous, 
Gideon Joubert, Gertjie Prinsloo, Johan Coetzee, Hennie de Witt, 
Jannie Geldenhuys and Kat Liebenberg.

Ramaphosa said the ANC's finances were also under scrutiny and 
that levies were being imposed on its paid public 
representatives to help finance the organization.

  [Text] Cape Town June 23 SAPA -- The National Party [NP] 
announced its 34-member shadow cabinet on Thursday [23 June], 
including 10 members who were either ministers or deputy 
ministers in the portfolios they now have to monitor from 
opposition benches. The NP's six ministers, three deputy 
ministers and deputy speaker in the National Assembly were not 
included in the names released by NP leader Mr F W de Klerk at 
the party's weekly caucus meeting. 
  An NP statement said: "The function of these spokesmen will 
include ensuring that the NP's policies are effectively stated 
both within and outside parliament. 
  "Given that the NP is the biggest opposition party to the 
ANC, in spite of being part of the government of national unity 
its spokesmen will have an important watchdog role towards ANC 
and IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] ministers." 
  Shadow "ministers" who previously handled the portfolios to 
which they have been assigned include Dr Piet Welgemoed 
(transport), Mr Leon Wessels (labour), Mr Piet Marais 
(education), Mr Andre Fourie (land affairs), Mr Danie Schutte 
(justice), Mr Wynand Breytenbach (defence), Dr Theo Alant

<F P=106> [Interview with CP leader Ferdi Hartzenberg in Johannesburg </F>
and Freedom Front leader General Constand Viljoen in Cape Town 
by announcer Freek Robinson on the "Agenda" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Robinson] With me here in the studio is 
Conservative Party [CP] leader Ferdi Hartzenberg and, in our 
parliamentary studio in Cape Town, Freedom Front leader General 
Constand Viljoen. Good evening to both of you. Dr. Hartzenberg, 
if I could start with you, what exactly is your objection to the 
Volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] Council? 
  [Hartzenberg] Good evening, Freek. I think we have to look 
first at what our ideal is -- our objective, our mission. What 
are we striving for? Let me sum it up like this: The Afrikaner 
nation may be the nation with the strongest desire for freedom 
in the world -- not at the cost of others, but to be itself, to 
be free in its own fatherland, to coexist and live in harmony 
with other nations in South Africa -- in other words, to have 
political sovereignty, to have its own territorial security, and 
to be able to work with all other nations economically and in 
all other spheres. Our objection to the Volkstaat Council is 
both the constitution and the accord; these limit the Volkstaat 
Council and exclude that possibility because.... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] I'm not sure about that. In any 
case, I have that constitutional principle here before me, and I 
can't see those aspects being excluded, perhaps not exactly in 
the way that you would want. So perhaps you must define exactly 
how you want it. 
  [Hartzenberg] I say, a sovereign state....[pauses] We also 
made proposals at Kempton Park, where we proposed that there 
should be a confederal order in South Africa so that those 
nations that want full self-determination can get it, and others 
that want other forms can also get them, so that all can 
cooperate in a confederation. But we want political 
sovereignty, and economic and other forms of cooperation. The 
constitutional principle there is one of 34. All the other 33 
constitutional principles are compulsory. They stipulate that 
this and that will be like this. The very first one says South 
Africa must be one single sovereign state. In other words, that 
principle already excludes self-determination in the context 
that we want it -- complete freedom. It excludes that. That 
same constitutional principle also says that while South 
Africa's population as a whole must have self-determination, 
there can also be self-determination for any community or nation. 
  [Robinson] That does not rule out the possibility that on 
the 
basis of culture and language there could very well be a region, 
whether inside South Africa or in any other recognized way -- 
another recognized way.... 
  [Hartzenberg, interrupting] The point is, that region and 
that self-determination -- the farthest you can go with it is to 
create a 10th province, in other words, a province which will 
not have complete freedom and complete self-determination. It 
will still be under a central government with a tremendous 
amount of power, which will determine the education policy and 
the economic policy; which will dominate in all aspects; in 
other words, that is the most you can get. 
  [Robinson] Did you discuss that with President Mandela when 
you saw him on the three occasions; and does he agree with the 
fact that there is no way possible for you to establish an 
independent state? 
  [Hartzenberg] I discussed this thing with President Mandela, 
even long before the election, and he knows exactly what are the 
aspirations of our nation. The example which I cited is: If the 
Swazi people can be free and independent, and can live with 
everybody in South Africa in harmony and cooperation, then it is 
also a right to which the Afrikaner nation is entitled. 
  [Robinson] What was his reaction? 
  [Hartzenberg] He said he understands what we mean. But you 
have heard that several speakers in the ANC say no 
self-determination, no volkstaat for the Afrikaner, and that is 
exactly the problem. And that is why we did not support that 
constitutional principle in Parliament, as it does not make 
provision for full freedom and self- determination. That is why 
we did not sign the accord; that is why we did not participate 
in the election. 
  [Robinson] Can we just ask General Viljoen in Cape Town -- 
do 
you also see this principle and the Volkstaat Council's function 
limited, as Dr. Hartzenberg sees it, that you do not have the 
option -- even if you wanted -- to have an independent state? 
  [Viljoen] I want to start by differing with you, Freek, when 
you said that there was a deep-rooted difference of opinion. I 
think there are only differences regarding the way to achieve 
it, but what Dr. Hartzenberg has just explained about the 
striving for freedom, I agree with that. The striving for 
freedom is something that we all agree on, and the ultimate 
objective that we are striving for is definitely also the same. 
I personally did negotiate, and I tried several times to. 
There is probably nobody else who tried harder to negotiate for 
a more positive constitutional principle than number 34. We 
would very much have liked this principle, as Dr. Hartzenberg 
also mentioned....[pauses] Now we come to the question: Is it 
still relevant or not? The fact is, as I see it, that the only 
way -- other than war -- that one can pursue to get a volkstaat 
is to use the constitutionally-provided system for that purpose. 
  [Robinson] I understand that, General. But can we clarify 
this point? Do you believe that this principle is so limiting 
that you cannot really become fully independent, even if you 
wanted to? 
  [Viljoen] I think the difference between this principle and 
the previous ones lies in the fact that the previous ones all 
dealt with negotiated aspects, formulated, and that is why they 
use the word "will." Because -- in the limited time that we had 
available -- we could not finalize this issue of a volkstaat 
concept through negotiations with the different parties, the 
word "will" was not used, but instead the word "can." If we can 
reach such an agreement, I believe it is quite possible to be 
able to resolve this matter. The council says very clearly that 
different forms of self- determination -- and in my opinion that 
does not exclude the full negotiated approval of all the various 
parties.... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] But what is your personal point of 
view? Reading between the lines, it seems you are not 
personally in favor of a totally independent homeland? 
  [Viljoen] I wouldn't put it that way. Let's look at the 
economy. A totally independent homeland would imply that you 
would also be economically independent. And what about foreign 
affairs? In our talks with the ANC, we have discussed the issue, 
and even when we were still in the National Front, we felt that 
foreign affairs was a function which the homeland would most 
probably delegate to the central government. So in these two 
areas it becomes clear that it would be very difficult to create 
such a fully independent homeland immediately. If there was an 
area in South Africa where it was obvious that we had a 
majority, where it was almost a mere formality to draw borders, 
it would be easy. But we still have to form a homeland, and it 
will depend on the Afrikaners themselves, so it may be necessary 
to promote their independent homeland in phases. That is why it 
is important to me that we now stand together to try to get 
started on these phases. 
  [Robinson] Your response, Dr. Hartzenberg? 
  [Hartzenberg] Freek, I also believe that we may achieve our 
freedom in stages, and not in our first attempt. But what is 
important is that one should not accept the first phase as the 
final phase and then enter into agreements which bind one to 
decisions taken, and surrender the right to eventual sovereignty. 
  [Robinson] It seems that the difference between you and Gen. 
Viljoen is that you stand firm on the issue of an independent 
state. 
  [Hartzenberg] Look, that is our goal and we will not rest 
until we have achieved it. I am not prepared to surrender that 
goal. The Palestinians have now reached a settlement with the 
Israelis, but they do not have full sovereignty. They accept 
the settlement; they say it is not their final goal, but that 
they will press on. The unfortunate thing in our case is that 
the agreements and the constitution say the Volkstaat Council 
can undertake research and gather information and give advise, 
but that the Constitutional Assembly will make the final 
decision. It is the same as if you and I agree to a sale, and 
agree that when I have bought the article, I will decide what 
price to pay. If I then offer to pay you one cent for the 
article, you will not be able to claim that you were depending 
on my being reasonable. You will have to accept what we agreed 
upon. That is why we say if we bind ourselves to these 
agreements under the constitution, we will leave the right to 
sovereignty in the hands of the ANC or whoever is governing this 
country. We say we will never surrender the ideal of a free 
Afrikaner nation living in harmony with other nations. There 
will be no solution in South Africa unless the various nations 
have been accommodated according to their wishes. 
  [Robinson] Dr. Hartzenberg, you have established a People's 
Republic Committee. One assumes that the goal of the committee 
is the same as that of the Volkstaat Council, except that 
independence must come first? 
  [Hartzenberg] The function of the Republic Working Committee 
is to make recommendations, investigate, determine strategies in 
the constitutional, economic, social, security, education, local 
government, and other areas, and begin with the practical 
implementation of certain strategies; and to continue until we 
achieve our goal of a free Afrikaner nation in a free republic. 
  [Robinson] It seems logical to me that one would expect this 
committee of yours and the Volkstaat Council to liaise in some 
way. 
  [Hartzenberg] We would want that to be supplementary. We 
will have to ensure that our relationship is not 
confrontational. What is important is that we are operating 
outside the parliamentary system, and we have an important 
function to carry out. Remember, the ANC had never been in the 
parliamentary system. They only entered the parliamentary 
system when they took power. For years the Democratic Party 
[DP] propagated certain things, but they came nowhere, achieved 
nothing, until Dr. Van Zyl Slabbert and Alex Boraine left the 
system and started operating from outside. And they achieved 
more than the DP had intended.... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] But there was also the matter of 
violence, and you said so in public. 
  [Hartzenberg] No, no. It is for that reason that, on the day 
after the inauguration of the state president, I called his 
office and asked for a meeting, because I believe it is possible 
to resolve this issue without violence. 
  [Robinson] Gen. Viljoen, how do you think these two 
committees or councils will liaise? How will they work together? 
  [Viljoen] Let me begin by saying that the achievement of our 
ideal of a homeland, of self-determination for the Afrikaner 
within a homeland, is a matter so closely linked to the future 
constitution of South Africa that the two cannot easily be 
separated. Afrikaners should realize that while we are one 
nation, we have three fairly large parties, and then there are 
many more smaller parties. So we have to find a mechanism which 
will allow us to speak with a single voice on the issue of 
self-determination. If we cannot get that right, we have big 
problems. We must establish a nonpolitical body. I believe the 
various political parties should now remain in the background so 
that we can forget about the contentious political issues and 
continue with the scientific aspects, the feasibility of the 
homeland. 
  [Robinson] But there are two bodies, General. How are they 
going to be reconciled with each other? 
  [Viljoen] No, no, I will come to that. In my opinion this 
means that we should use the Volkstaat Council as such a body. 
It is up to the Volkstaat Council to make scientific studies and 
to present the whole matter. Then from the political side -- I 
have recently made such a proposition to Dr. Hartzenberg -- we 
can form a political plenary committee from among the different 
parties. These ideas, as they are developed by the Volkstaat 
Council, will be analyzed and will give direction. 
  [Robinson] Doctor, what do you say about that? 
  [Hartzenberg] Freek, the Volkstaat Council has this 
limitation: It is limited by the constitution and accords to 
only get as far as a province. And we must be satisfied with 
that, because if we do not accept it, then we must break the 
contract. Then we will be taken to court, and the court will 
find the constitutional body to be right: We have accepted and 
signed a contract, a contract which we would be breaking. We 
would then be defying a court decision. If those limitations 
were eliminated and the Volkstaat Council given an open agenda 
-- so that it could go as far as full sovereignty -- then we 
would consider the thing. At the moment, however, the Volkstaat 
Council is limited. It cannot go past a 10th province, which 
will be just like the other provinces. 
  [Robinson] Now what are you going to do in the future? 
  [Hartzenberg] Through our national Republic Working 
Committee 
we are going to negotiate.... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] With the government? 
  [Hartzenberg] I have discussed the matter with the state 
president. We are going to make proposals. We are going to make 
it known in an agenda -- if you will give us that chance -- on 
all fronts.... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] Directly to him, not through the 
Volkstaat Council? 
  [Hartzenberg] No, because if we go through the Volkstaat 
Council, then we accept the limitations that we can only go as 
far as a province, and our point of departure is: Everybody 
must know -- including the ANC and the whole world -- our 
ultimate goal is and remains sovereignty, and if we achieve 
something along the way, then it will only be a step. It will 
not be left in the hands of the constitutional body to finally 
decide on our behalf. If they give us something, we will decide 
whether that brings us closer to our goal. But we will not 
abandon out goal along the way. 
  [Robinson] In conclusion, General Viljoen, just briefly on 
one issue we have not yet touched: Should there be another form 
of voting just to determine whether there is going to be a 
homeland? 
  [Viljoen] The interesting part is this -- as I have just 
said 
-- we have three fairly big parties. Let us say the proven 
support at the moment of 640,000 on the provincial level for the 
Freedom Front is sufficient proven support. If one should add 
to that the stayaway votes of the Conservative Party, then it 
becomes majority support, and if we further accept.... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] But that support has to be 
demonstrated. 
  [Viljoen] But that is the problem. At the moment 640,000 is 
already sufficient proven support. The point I am making is 
that if one considers that there are also others, and if one 
considers that within the National Party there is considerable 
enthusiasm for the same idea at the grassroots level, then we do 
not only have proven support but majority support. But what is 
very important, Freek -- something that we have to realize -- is 
that there are no limitations on the goal of a homeland. The 
limitations apply only to the process of negotiation. But then 
such constitutional limitations will be exactly the same as when 
one works directly with the ANC. Whether you are negotiating 
inside or outside Parliament, the limitations -- if there are 
any, and I don't think there are -- will be the same. 
  [Robinson] Thank you very much, General. Thank you, Dr. 
Ferdi Hartzenberg. It seems there will still be some wrestling 
in the future to solve this problem. Thank you for your 
participation.

  [Text] Johannesburg June 23 SAPA -- The national violence 
death toll dropped by 60 per cent from April's 487 to 195 during 
May, the Human Rights Committee [HRC] said on Thursday [23 
June]. In its monthly report the HRC said violence in 
KwaZulu/Natal had continued to drop, with the May death toll of 
104 the lowest recorded since January 1993. 
  Despite ongoing tensions in the area, the declining death 
toll supported the HRC's repeated calls for the lifting of the 
state of emergency in KwaZulu/Natal, the HRC said. The 195 
deaths in May were considerably lower than the 1994 monthly 
average of 365 and the 1993 monthly average of 367. 
  There were 73 deaths in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging], 104 in Natal, and 18 elsewhere, bringing the year 
total to 1,826. 
  Of the 195 victims, ten were women and five children. Two 
white civilians were among those killed in May. 
  The 226 incidents of violence in May represented a 65 
percent 
decrease from the April figure of 649. This low level of 
violence had not been experienced since January 1993, the HRC 
said. 
  Only one "major massacre" took place in May -- the 
execution-style killing of 12 people in Thokoza, linked to 
fighting between Self-Defence Units in Katlehong. 
  The right wing, with no deaths attributed to it in May, 
appeared to have been neutralised after it caused 24 deaths and 
184 injuries during its bombing campaign in April. 
  Taxi violence, with 14 deaths, increased for the third month 
in succession. 
  On human rights, the HRC recorded declining figures in 
detentions without trial, deaths in police custody and political 
arrests. 
  It reported as a violation of the freedom of assembly the 
order circulated by Eastern Cape Premier Raymond Mhlaba banning 
civil servants in the province from going on strike.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H8>
  Rattling the Keys -- "The good news in the Budget is that 
there is little really bad news," notes an editorial in 
Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English on 24-30 June 
on 
page 28. "This budget is designed to please the 'golden 
triangle' of business, labour and the state." "In balancing the 
need for social spending against the demand for fiscal 
discipline" Keys has "set solid standards for the future." "If 
there is nothing dramatically stimulatory in the Budget, there 
is nothing particularly dampening either. By lowering the basic 
corporation tax rate while doing nothing to alleviate the tax 
burden of individuals" it "favors investment at the expense of 
consumption." "Some more details on how Budget planning fits in 
with the RDP [Research and Development Program] would have been 
helpful, not only to hesitant foreign investors but to those who 
are monitoring the programme to see if it will really deliver on 
its promises." 
<H8>  NEW NATION </H8>
  New Budget -- There is no doubt that the Budget will be 
assessed on its "commitment to the priorities identified in the 
Reconstruction and Development Programme" as the RDP is the 
"flagship of the new government," notes an editorial in 
Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on 24 June on page 8. 
However, "it needs to be said from the outset that the budget 
was disappointing in the extreme, in that it did not go far 
enough in addressing the plight of the country's estimated 
16-million poor citizens." VAT [value added tax] was not 
mentioned, nor were basic foodstuffs "zero-rated," which means 
"millions of unemployed" pay the "same VAT as the affluent 
suburban elite." And the lower corporate taxation "should not 
be allowed to benefit the corporate sector alone" and "we hope 
that the government's decision to lower company taxation is 
interpreted" as a "desire to see greater job creation in the 
business sector." "We see no logic" in the decision to allocate 
"at least 13 percent more to defense expenditure" as "we are 
committed to moving into a reconciliation mode" when "spending 
on safety and security has increased only 6.5 percent." And the 
"deficiencies in the tax collection system" must be addressed 
and overhauled with "urgency." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Budget To Test Keys' Credibility -- "The Budget has met with 
widespread approval and a great deal of relief," begins the 
Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 24 June in a page-12 
editorial. "But Finance Minister Derek Keys knows that the new 
government is on trial. The real judgment on its performance 
will come next March, when Keys tells Parliament how close he 
came to fulfilling the expectations he raised." "Keys showed 
with his first Budget that the intends to keep his promises. If 
he can do the same with his second under far more difficult 
circumstances, he will have laid the basis for the economic 
transformation he seeks. It will not be easy. Keys has a 
roomful of Cabinet colleagues all itching to spend more than 
they have been allocated." In conclusion the BUSINESS DAY 
writes that "Keys has exceptional credibility for a politician, 
but he is about to be tested. If the new government is to be 
believed in the years ahead, by the businessmen and investors on 
whom depend the growth, jobs and tax revenues essential for 
prosperity and peace, he must ensure the whole Cabinet keeps his 
promises." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Budget Balances Needs of Haves/Have-nots -- "Finance 
Minister 
Mr Derek Keys had to satisfy three major constituencies in his 
Budget and he has done just that," begins the Johannesburg 
SOWETAN in English on 24 June in a page-12 editorial. "Keys has 
carefully balanced the needs of the have-nots, of investors and 
the fears of many white South Africans." The money set aside 
for the Reconstruction and Development Program's "special 
projects" "does not seem to be much. But the truth is the 
Government has paid some attention to the needs of the underdog. 
The test the Government must face now is how efficiently it can 
deliver the promises of the RDP to the people who put them in 
power."

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] Good evening! In Lusaka, there is much expectation 
on the debate regarding the installation of the National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] and its high 
officials. Despite the fact that their differences have been 
narrowed, the government and UNITA negotiators are still meeting 
alone in the search for a solution for accommodations for Jonas 
Savimbi's organization and its senior leaders. This afternoon's 
meeting began at 1700 and has not yet been concluded. That is 
why there is great expectation about the meeting. We may give 
more details about the meeting soon. 
  Meanwhile, UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye 
and 
members of the troika of observers are ready to leave for Cape 
Town, South Africa. They will leave the Zambian capital early 
morning tomorrow. In South Africa, the special representative 
of the UN secretary general in Angola and his team will request 
assistance from President Nelson Mandela with the Angolan peace 
talks, taking advantage of his influence and the prestige 
enjoyed by the new president of that country.

  [Excerpt] At a news conference in Maputo today, Dr. Brazao 
Mazula, chairman of the National Election Commission [CNE], 
spoke of the latest developments on the electoral process in the 
country. Germano de Sousa reports: 
  [De Sousa] This afternoon CNE Chairman Brazao Mazula told 
correspondents that 20 percent of voting age Mozambicans have 
already registered throughout the country. This percentage 
represents 1.7 million voters. Mazula said at the news 
conference that a new timetable will be announced soon for the 
registration of a specified group of voters, who in view of 
circumstances cannot register within the established timetable. 
The people who will benefit from this include refugees still in 
neighboring countries and soldiers confined in different 
assembly areas waiting to hear their fate. 
  Two issues considered important did not have definite 
answers 
at the news conference. They are the issues of emigrants who 
still do not have approval to vote in the election and the trust 
fund for the operation of political parties. Mazula said these 
two issues are discussed in almost all the CNE meetings. Mazula 
also said that the CNE has not yet issued guidelines on the 
operation of mobile voter registration teams, an issue which 
raises doubts about the voting process by the electorate in the 
areas concerned. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cape Town June 23 SAPA -- South African President 
Nelson Mandela has agreed to become involved in international 
mediation attempts aimed at ending Angola's civil war. Mr 
Mandela said at Tuynhuys on Thursday that he was prepared to 
meet UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] 
leader Jonas Savimbi, preferably in South Africa. 
  Speaking after a meeting with United Nations Mediator 
Alioune Blondin Beye and representatives of the United States, 
Portuguese and Russian Governments, Mr Mandela said he would 
first contact Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and then 
Dr Savimbi. 
  "I would be happy to invite Dr Savimbi and to sit down and 
have a discussion with him. I know Mr dos Santos' point of 
view, but I've never had the honour of meeting Dr Savimbi. I am 
prepared to see both parties in the near future," he said. 
  Mr Beye said Mr Mandela had been asked to become involved as 
the leader of a nation that neighboured Angola and also had 
substantial assets there. He said South Africa had 
geographical, historical and political ties to Angola. 
  Mr Mandela said South African companies had invested in oil 
and diamond mining in Angola, and an end to the civil war that 
has raged since 1975 would be a positive advantage to South 
Africa. 
  Mr Beye said the UN's priority was not to bring about a 
direct meeting between Dr Savimbi and Mr dos Santos. It first 
wanted to contact Mr dos Santos and then to set up a meeting 
between Mr Mandela and Dr Savimbi.

  [Text] Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the 
UN secretary general in Angola, met with South African President 
Nelson Mandela in Cape Town today. Present at the meeting were 
six observers in the Angolan peace process, including the U.S. 
ambassador in South Africa. Alioune Blondin Beye briefed Nelson 
Mandela on the development of the peace talks in Lusaka. Manuel 
Augusto, Angolan charge d'affaires in South Africa, told Luanda 
Radio Nacional today that the meeting was positive. 
  [Begin recording] [Augusto] As far as we know, President 
Mandela expressed gratitude for the briefing. He also expressed 
his readiness, at the request of the relevant parties, to render 
his contribution within the framework of the Lusaka talks. In 
other words, President Mandela made it clear that he will not 
take initiatives which are outside the Lusaka spirit or which 
could collide with the Lusaka spirit. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] We have learned here in Luanda 
that President Nelson Mandela has agreed to join the group of 
mediators in the Angolan conflict, that he even expressed a 
readiness to meet very soon with President Jose Eduardo dos 
Santos and Jonas Savimbi, leader of the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. When do you think these 
meetings will take place, particularly with the president of the 
Republic? 
  [Augusto] In my understanding, I think it is not very 
correct 
to say that he agreed to join the group of mediators. In his 
capacity as the head of state at the present, President Mandela 
would not join anyone, because we have no mediators at the level 
of heads of state. It is correct to say, however, that 
President Mandela expressed a readiness to join efforts aimed at 
bringing peace to Angola. 
  President Mandela also said at the end of the meeting this 
afternoon that, at the request of the UN mediators, he is ready 
to meet with all the parties involved in the process. It is 
important to clarify, however, that at no time was it said that 
there would be a summit meeting. As long as he is requested, 
President Mandela is ready to take part in or promote meetings 
with the Angolan Government and UNITA. 
  Regarding the meeting with President Jose Eduardo dos 
Santos, 
President Mandela has just expressed his readiness to meet him. 
So, some contacts will be made through the appropriate levels 
and channels between the South African Government and the 
Angolan Government so that the Angolan Government can tell the 
South African Government in which areas it expects it to render 
its contribution. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] An extraordinary meeting of ministers took place 
between from 23-24 June under the chairmanship of the interim 
head of state, His Excellency Sylvestre Ntibantunganya. [passage 
omitted] 
  Government ministers discussed the question of French troops 
being sent to Rwanda. The Burundi Government stated that it 
would not get involved in the internal affairs of other 
countries, but it asked the Rwandan warring parties to stop 
fighting and to continue peace talks. The government expressed 
its concern over the continuing killing of innocents. That is 
exactly the point which the interim president emphasized at the 
Tunis OAU summit, although according to some rumors in Bujumbura 
the interim president allowed France to use Burundi as a transit 
point for its troops to enter Rwanda. The interim president 
informed the Council of Ministers that this was surprising, 
since he had never discussed the question with the French 
authorities at the OAU summit. However, you should remember 
that some people recently staged demonstrations in Bujumbura 
against the dispatch of French troops to Rwanda. The Council of 
Ministers confirmed that, under a democratic system, every 
citizen is free to stage demonstrations, but should at the same 
time respect the relevant laws. The Council of Ministers took 
the opportunity to call on security services to ensure that laws 
are respected.

  [Excerpts] The interim president of Burundi, Mr. Sylvestre 
Ntibantunganya, today held a press conference at the Novotel 
Hotel for local and foreign reporters. He talked about the 
institution of the president, the pirate radio which can 
currently be heard on the national territory, security, the 
economy, etc. I suggest you listen to the statement he issued 
before allowing journalists to ask their questions. Before 
issuing his statement, the interim head of state said the deputy 
speaker of the National Assembly, Mr. Christian Sendegeya, had 
tendered his resignation to him. Here is President 
Ntibantunganya. 
  [Begin Ntibantunganya recording] [Words indistinct] April 
1994, Burundi is once again at a political impasse without a 
head of state with all the powers invested in him by the 
Constitution. This followed the untimely death of President 
Ntaryamira. Since 12 April, there has been an interim 
presidency which ends on 12 July. 
  Many of you are asking yourselves several questions related 
to the future of this beautiful country which everyone 
cherishes, but which causes concern. One question lingers on 
the lips of everyone: When will we have a head of state with all 
the powers endowed to him by the Constitution. This question is 
even more pressing when one sees what is happening around us, 
first in our country, and then in the neighboring country of 
Rwanda. In the light of this, people are very worried. [passage 
omitted] 
  Besides the serious, shameful and reprehensible interethnic 
massacres, political score-settling, and all sorts of crimes 
which have been committed, the country today is on the verge of 
an abyss. Distrust among citizens, notably with reference to 
their political and ethnic affiliations, has reached its climax. 
[passage omitted] 
  For the last few days, pirate radio broadcasts have been 
heard in some parts of the country. It broadcasts messages 
which are contrary to peaceful co-existence between the various 
groups in the country, notably ethnic and professional groups. 
The government would like the population to note that the radio 
is functioning in violation of the country's laws. The 
government is determined to do everything to cripple it. 
[passage omitted] 
  Peace must be everyone's priority. That is why the 
government has been working hard all week to accelerate and 
finalize, through consultations between the various political 
and social partners, the process of establishing the institution 
of the president of the Republic with all the powers invested in 
him by the Constitution. This is an extremely strategic 
objective for peace and security in the country. That is why 
all the national political partners must combine efforts, show 
proof of good will, and be sensitive to the call issued to them 
by the Burundi people who are concerned about what they consider 
to be stagnation of this process. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bujumbura, 26 Jun (PANA) -- Mr. Christian Sendegeya, 
deputy speaker of the National Assembly, has resigned from his 
post, it was learned here today from an official source. The 
announcement of this resignation, which observers say is a 
surprise, was made by Interim President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya 
during a news conference held to mainly brief the press on the 
presidential investiture expected to take place before 12 July 
-- date on which interim period expires -- in conformity with 
the Constitution. 
  Mr. Sendegaya is the deputy of Kayanza Province -- located 
in 
northern Burundi -- which recently was the scene of armed 
clashes that left dozens of civilians dead. He is also the 
author of the cassette: "Inciting Ethnic Hatred," according to 
the terms of a suit filed in court by Mr. Charles Mukasi, 
chairman of the former sole party, the Unity and National 
Progress Party [Uprona], which is now the parliamentary 
opposition. 
  This unprecedented gesture in Burundian political practices 
will bring back into parliament the 16 Uprona deputies who had 
been boycotting the Assembly's sessions to protest the 
statements made by Christian Sendegeya on his tape, according to 
observers. The Uprona representatives had said they would 
return to parliament on condition that Sendegeya withdraws his 
statements. 
  The National Assembly comprises 81 members, 65 of whom are 
members of the Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU). It is 
expected to appoint by consensus a head of state -- following 
discussions between the opposition and the ruling power -- to 
replace President Cyprien Ntaryamira who was killed on 6 April 
in a plane crash in Kigali. Rwandan President Juvenal 
Habyarimana was also killed in that plane crash. 
  Mr Ntaryamira's predecessor, Melchior Ndadaye, first 
democratically elected Burundian president, was killed on 21 
October 1993 in an unsuccessful military coup attempt.

  [Text] Brazzaville, June 25 (AFP) -- Congo favours sending 
troops to Rwanda to support French troops carrying out a 
humanitarian mission on condition the Union of Central African 
States (UDEAC) asks it to at its meeting Monday [27 June] in 
Libreville, an authoritative source said here Saturday. 
  "We had planned to send troops in the framework of the 
United 
Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda. But because of the size 
of task, if UDEAC decides to speed up this mission with respect 
to the French intervention, we are ready to do it," the source 
told AFP. 
  On Friday, the six UDEAC heads of state welcomed the French 
initiative. 
  Congo has 25 officers in Rwanda as part of the UN operation 
and plans to boost its contingent to 300 men. 
  Senegal is the only African country to have taken part in 
the 
French operation.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Ten thousand people 
demonstrated today in districts of Kigali under RPF [Rwandan 
Patriotic Front] control, shouting anti- French slogans. In the 
meantime, the French soldiers have continued their 
reconnaissance mission in the west of the country, in the zones 
under the control of Hutu-majority government forces. They have 
made progress along the border with Zaire, as reported by France 
Inter special envoy, Nicolas Poincare, who is in southwest 
Rwanda: 
  [Begin Poincare recording] After they arrived in Cyangugu 
yesterday, the French troops moved toward the interior of the 
country today. The commandos have gone up north, toward a town 
about which they know almost nothing. They have been to the 
east, to a forest, where many Tutsi refugees have been hiding. 
Finally, they have been southward, toward Bugarama, where a 
refugee camp housing 15,000 people is reported to have been set 
up. These French soldiers are not in large numbers, they are 
about 200 paratroopers and marine commandos, but they seemed to 
be in a hurry to get on with their job. They have been met with 
exuberant welcome from the Hutus. The Hutu militiamen had 
French flags around their necks. The children carried banners on 
which Vive la France were written. At Nyarushishi refugee camp, 
the 8000 Tutsi refugees have also welcomed the French troops. 
These survivors of massacres were the first to be reached by 
the paratroopers yesterday afternoon. They said they have been 
under threat for weeks. [passage omitted] 
  These refugees are now being protected by 60 heavily armed 
French paratroopers. They said they slept peacefully last night 
for the first time for weeks. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Michel Cariou] </F>
  [Text] Kamembe, Rwanda, June 26 (AFP) -- Crack French 
troops in southwestern Rwanda on Saturday [25 June] set about 
ordering down roadblocks manned by Hutu militiamen accused of 
massacres and atrocities against the minority Tutsis. 
  An eight-man paratrooper team roamed the Kamembe area in a 
reconnaissance vehicle, a machine-gun -- in position and ready 
to fire -- mounted on the roof. 
  The soldiers, from France's 11th Armored Division, are part 
of the first French advance teams sent in from Zaire on Thursday 
on what Paris has said is a strictly humanitarian mission -- 
codenamed Operation Turquoise -- to protect minority Tutsis 
trapped in Hutu zones. 
  They showed no hesitation when they encountered roadblocks, 
and their "determination," as one French soldier put it, made 
Hutu militiamen understand they meant business. 
  The message was the same each time they hit a roadblock: 
"Return to your work, your fields. France is here to ensure 
your safety, the safety of all Rwandans. You must take down the 
barriers." 
  The patrols started combing the roads Friday in the 
southwest 
near the southern tip of Lake Kivu and just over the border with 
Zaire. 
  "All roadblocks held by civilians must disappear," said 
French Colonel Didier Thibaut, who heads the operation in the 
Kamembe zone. "They have no legitimacy. We only want to see 
soldiers and policemen on the road." 
  The firm tone is the same when the team questions the 
manager 
of the local airport. "What are these barrels blocking the 
runway? You think the RPF (rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front) have 
planes?" 
  When the airport manager tries to argue that there "might be 
pirate flights," the French captain's answer is short: "Get 
these out of here." 
  At another roadblock on a route parallel to Lake Kivu, the 
patrol met a civilian armed with a grenade. 
  "Hey you, are you a soldier?" a French troop demands. The 
man, clearly caught off guard, replies that he is not. 
  "Then give me that. A civilian has no business carrying a 
grenade," the French patrol orders, and the man quickly handed 
over the grenade without protest. 
  As they turned to leave, the French patrol left the man with 
a final warning: "We are going to come by here often and we 
don't want to see anyone here and no roadblocks. Understand?" 
  One paratrooper said the French patrols generally "had to 
insist" but said the Hutu militiamen were obeying orders to take 
down the barriers, if slowly, though many still remained 
Saturday. 
  France is committed to sending 2,500 soldiers to take part 
in 
the UN-authorized military intervention, which is to last two 
months. 
  France went ahead with the mission despite warnings from the 
Tutsi-dominated RPF, which blames France for arming and propping 
up Hutu regimes in Kigali whose forces are blamed for most of 
the estimated 500,000 dead since Rwanda slipped back into civil 
war in April. 
  UN spokesman Pierre Mehu in Kigali told AFP Saturday that 
the 
rebel RPF that even if it did not welcome the French troops the 
rebels would not fight them provided they stuck to their 
humanitarian mission. 
  Another 200 French soldiers are in Gisenyi, a key town in 
Rwanda's northwest where the interim government opposed by the 
rebels has set up after fleeing rebel advances. 
  Thousands of residents massed into the town when the French 
troops arrived in Gisenyi from Goma, Zaire, on Thursday, crying 
"Long Live France" and children waved French flags. 
  But an authoritative Rwandan source Saturday said the 
welcome 
had been staged by the local Hutu political leaders.

<F P=106> [Report by Christophe Boisbouvier in Goma] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Boisbouvier] [passage omitted] In Corfu, the 
European Union summit has asked for the trial of those behind 
the genocide in Rwanda. Europe has also expressed its support 
for the French operation. [passage omitted] 
  And now the situation in Kigali: Violent fighting took place 
again this morning, but subsided in the afternoon. However, the 
United Nations was not able to continue its humanitarian 
missions. (Pierre Mehu), the UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in 
Rwanda] spokesman in Kigali, has some explanations: 
  [(Mehu)] The situation is still very tense. [Words 
indistinct] we were not able to evacuate the orphans from the 
Saint-Michel orphanage; we were to take them to the King Faisal 
hospital today, but we couldn't because of the bad security 
conditions. 
  [Correspondent Ghislaine Dupont] Do you have the impression 
that the Rwandan Patriotic Front is still very hostile to the 
French intervention operation? 
  [(Mehu)] I would say that their hostility has subsided. 
Colonel Frank Mugambage, who is the leader of the delegation at 
the cease-fire talks, gave a news conference yesterday. He said 
that the Rwandan Patriotic Front may reconsider its 
position--not renounce, but reconsider its position--if the 
French initiative is limited to the humanitarian side of things. 
  [Dupont] Does UNAMIR have any contact with those behind 
Operation Turquoise? 
  [(Mehu)] Well, telephone contact has been established. The 
commander of the general force, Dallaire, is to meet the 
commander of the French intervention force over the next few 
days.

  [Text] Operation Turquoise, the French military and 
humanitarian mission in Rwanda, has entered its active phase. 
  Yesterday alone, French soldiers officially carried out four 
patrols within Rwandan territory from their Zairean bases in 
Goma and Bukavu. The strategy of the French forces is to 
increase the number of patrols in refugee camps. General 
Lafourcade, the commander of Operation Turquoise, outlined the 
details to Christophe Boisbouvier: 
  [Begin Lafourcade recording] In the north we went to Kanama 
some five km east of (Ndjihi), where we found a camp housing 400 
Hutus. It seems that health conditions there are not 
disastrous, but this remains to be confirmed. We also went to 
(Manyumba). We are now stepping up our effort: we have some 
1,000 soldiers and around 100 vehicles. There are around 40 
soldiers in Rwanda -- we are sending more today on 
reconnaissance missions -- some of them are returning to Zaire 
for the night. They are in the south; I will not tell you 
precisely where because they are on permanent reconnaissance 
missions. They stop at night, usually near a refugee camp. [end 
recording] 
  One thousand French soldiers and 40 Senegalese soldiers are 
already taking part in Operation Turquoise. What are the 
relations between Operation Turquoise and soldiers of the 
Rwandan Army? Gen. Lafourcade gives some more details: 
  [Begin Lafourcade recording] We have very few contacts with 
the Rwandan Armed Forces apart from normal courtesy contacts 
with the authorities to prevent errors. You will understand 
that it is important to avoid confusing government soldiers and 
rebels or poorly organized militiamen under no one's authority. 
So we are simply establishing contacts with the (?local) 
authorities and moving on to refugee camps to protect the 
population. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with French General Jean-Claude Lafourcade, </F>
Operation Turquoise commander, by Benoit Duquesne in Goma, Zaire 
-- live] 
  [Text] [Duquesne] General Germanos said yesterday that the 
situation was delicate because of tension at the roadblocks. Do 
you agree with this description? 
  [Lafourcade] Obviously, Gen. Germanos is speaking of our 
current deployment. It is always a difficult period because we 
are setting up a large force 8,000 km away from France, and you 
must understand that there are grounds for concern in an 
operation of this nature. That being said, let me tell you that 
everything is going well -- you can see this for yourself. The 
UN resolution was adopted last Wednesday [22 June], I believe. 
It is now Sunday, and more than 1,000 soldiers and 120 vehicles 
have arrived here. 
  [Duquesne] Does this mean that this is only the start of the 
operation, that you are carrying out reconnaissance missions in 
Rwandan territory, and that you feel that the situation might 
prove delicate for yourself and for your soldiers? 
  [Lafourcade] We immediately got in touch with the population 
in a difficult situation in Rwanda, with refugee camps, although 
our deployment is not even fully achieved. I believe that this 
decision was the right one, since we have already been able to 
reassure many refugees in a number of camps without going too 
far into the north or the south of Rwanda. 
  [Duquesne] A last question. You are arriving in a region 
controlled by government forces, where there are many Hutus. It 
is known that many Tutsis or moderate Hutus have been murdered. 
Don't you feel that you are coming a little late? 
  [Lafourcade] I will answer you like a soldier: A decision 
was 
made on Wednesday evening and there are already 1,000 soldiers 
four days later; I believe I am not too late. 
  [Duquesne] You were quick, but politically, wasn't it too 
late? 
  [Lafourcade] I should tell you that this is not my problem. 
I believe that our political negotiators who were behind this 
resolution wanted to ensure that the killings would be ended 
before the arrival of UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] 
II.

<F P=106> [Interview with French General Jean-Claude Lafourcade, </F>
commander of Operation Turquoise, by correspondent Patrick 
Poivre d'Arvor in Goma, Zaire -- live] 
  [Text] [D'Arvor] With us is General Jean-Claude Lafourcade, 
who heads Operation Turquoise, that is, the whole of this French 
operation in Rwanda. We get the impression that the first stage 
of your operation is first and foremost, a diplomatic one: You 
have tried to convince the people you met that you were coming 
with good intentions. 
  [Lafourcade] Listen, we have begun to carry out the mission 
entrusted to us by the United Nations, the mission that is to 
put an end to the massacres in Rwanda, and we are also setting 
up a system that, as you can see, is a large-scale one. It will 
take a few days to set up this system, but we did not want to 
wait until we went to Rwanda to go on the first reconnaissance 
missions to refugee camps and start showing our faces in order 
to put an end to the massacres. I believe that this mission has 
been going well so far. 
  [D'Arvor] Do you intend to go further, for instance, as far 
as Kigali? 
  [Lafourcade] My UN mandate--that is, Resolution 929--does 
not 
require me to go to Kigali. My mandate is to put an end to the 
massacres by using force if necessary against those 
troublemakers who carried out all those crimes. I am starting 
by discovering refugee camps. We are seeing what is what there 
so that humanitarian organizations can see what the situation is 
like.... 
  [D'Arvor, interrupting] If need be, could you evacuate them? 
  [Lafourcade] For the time being, there has not been any talk 
of evacuation at my level, but humanitarian organizations in the 
background are going to take care of this problem, and we have 
in our force a unit that is dealing with this problem, together 
with the humanitarian organizations. 
  [D'Arvor] It is obvious that your mission is to be the link 
until the arrival of the UN troops. Is your mandate--the 
precise mandate of the French forces--really going to end at the 
end of July, as has been said, or as the prime minister has said? 
  [Lafourcade] You know that some foreign countries are 
currently willing to take part in this UN force which will be 
called UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] II. In the 
mandate that I have received from the United Nations--that 
France has received from the United Nations--there was a delay 
spanning about two months. I do not know how this increase has 
come about, but I think that, together with General 
Dallaire--who is in Kigali and is currently the commander of the 
UNAMIR I force--we will organize the hand over of the baton. 
  [D'Arvor] Thank you very much, General Lafourcade.

  [Text] Despite the growing hostility of the militiamen, 
French paratroopers have entered Gisenyi unopposed. It is out 
of the question to yield to pressure from the militiamen, 
General Germanos, deputy chief of staff of the French Armed 
Forces, says. 
  [Begin Germanos recording] A certain number of militiamen 
are 
currently manning roadblocks on the roads along which our units 
are driving with the aim of reassuring the population. Faced 
with the very resolute stand adopted by our soldiers, who 
confronted the militiamen, and following a very stern warning 
from our men, the militiamen cleared roadblocks and pulled back. 
What we want, and we said so very firmly, is to prevent them 
from opposing in any way the action aimed at ending the killings 
and at controlling the situation. We will not accept that. [end

  [Text] Fighting has resumed in Kigali. The Rwandan 
Patriotic Front [RPF] rebels this afternoon shelled one of the 
last positions held by the government army, which caused a huge 
fire on Mount Kigali. Major Jean-Guy Plante, the UN mission 
spokesman in Kigali: 
  [Begin recording] [Plante] This afternoon, especially late 
this afternoon, fighting was extremely fierce in the center of 
Kigali. I myself saw explosions in the town of Kigali, but not 
on Mount Kigali. Mount Kigali, it is true, is a strategic 
(?point) which is held by the government forces. The rebel 
forces are trying to get hold of Mount Kigali, and the 
information I currently have shows that Mount Kigali is still 
being held by the government forces. 
  [Correspondent Ghislaine Dupont] Does the UNAMIR [UN 
Assistance Mission in Rwanda] believe that the RPF, the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front, has taken new positions in the capital? 
  [Plante] I would say that, given the information that I have 
and what I saw with my own eyes this afternoon--because I went 
for a walk in the town of Kigali--I would say that the front, 
the front line, the positions are almost the same as they were a 
week or 10 days ago despite the extremely (?fierce) and bloody 
fighting that has been going on over the last few days. [end

  [Text] The Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA] chief political 
commissar, Colonel Frank Mugambage, yesterday held a press 
conference in Kigali. 
  Journalists of the BBC, ABC, Finland, LIBERATION newspaper 
of 
France, and Radio Muhabura attended the press conference. 
  The focal point of the press conference was the presence of 
the French troops in Rwanda. 
  Asked how the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] views the French 
troops' presence in the country, Col. Frank Mugambage said that 
if the French troops came for a purely humanitarian mission, 
then the RPF has no quarrel with the French. But if they came 
with a hidden agenda of involvement in the war, then RPF is 
ready to defend itself. Col. Frank Mugambage explained that the 
RPF cannot stop bring suspicious about the French troops' 
presence, because the French Government has always used the 
pretext of humanitarian missions to intervene in the Rwandan 
conflict while they have other hidden interests. Col. Frank 
Mugambage also said that the French troops know very well that 
their government armed and trained Rwandan Government forces and 
militias, and therefore the French Government is responsible for 
the genocide and massacres committed in the country. 
  Asked what the RPF thinks about the French troops coming to 
Rwanda through Gisenyi and Cyangugu, an area controlled by 
Government forces, the RPA chief political commissar said that 
what is important is to know the actual reason for the French 
troops' presence. 
  Responding to a question on the Arusha peace agreement, Col. 
Frank Mugambage said that the Arusha peace agreement is not yet 
nullified and once the war is over, RPF is ready to respect the 
implementation of the agreement.

  [Excerpts] The French operation in Rwanda, Operation 
Turquoise, continues. This morning, 15 French military vehicles 
entered Rwanda through Cyangugu, in the southwest of the 
country. [passage omitted] 
  The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], one of the sides involved 
in the Rwandan civil war, has reconsidered its position on the 
French intervention, which was initially seen as a declaration 
of war. The RPF has made it known that it will henceforth 
renounce its intention of fighting against French troops if they 
limit their operation to a humanitarian one. The RPF can, 
therefore, be assured of the French military authorities' good 
faith. The military authorities have already met RPF leaders. 
(Jean-Baptiste Ndaumba), the RPF spokesman whom we interviewed 
this morning, explains the situation. 
  [Begin recording] [(Ndaumba)] Following several contacts 
with 
French diplomats, France has reassured us that its presence in 
Rwanda is purely for humanitarian reasons. We would like to 
accept that view, but we would like to countercheck matters on 
the ground. In order to accept France's show of good faith, we 
are demanding that it admits to its mistakes. 
  Second, we are demanding that the criminals who are in 
France 
be prevented from carrying out their activities. Third, we 
would like France to arrest the assassins in the areas that it 
is controlling. On the international level, we would like 
France to call for the establishment of an ad hoc tribunal to 
judge the perpetrators of the genocide. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] When France says that it is 
intervening to save Rwandans whose lives are endangered by the 
war, it is alluding to Tutsis who seem to be the target of 
government forces. Does this not imply that France is siding 
with the RPF? 
  [(Ndaumba)] The French policy in Rwanda to date has been a 
disaster. It is about time France realized this without 
contesting we will be pleased about that. Our point is that it 
is not a matter of going to Rwanda to assist the Tutsis as has 
been said: Our movement is made up of Both Tutsis and Hutus. 
There are moderate Hutus, as well as Hutus in the opposition 
who were massacred just like the Tutsis. This dual view is, 
therefore, [words indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] You are holding government forces 
responsible 
for the massacres in the country, but it seems the RPF is not 
beyond reproach either. 
  [(Ndaumba]) Mistakes may have been made, and there may have 
been blunders. However, we have admitted to them and we have 
pledged to penalize those responsible. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] One of our teams, consisting of Valerie Fourniou 
and Jean-Francois Hoffmann, was in Hutu country today, in the 
Gisenyi area in the north of the country, where what remains of 
the legal government, which fled Kigali, has taken refuge. 
  [Fourniou] [passage omitted] In Gisenyi, the Meridien Hotel 
has become a rear base of the provisional government. All the 
ministers have a room there, and to meet the prime minister we 
will need to be escorted. Far from Kigali, dressed in military 
fatigues and sitting in an armchair belonging to this hotel, he 
will tell us that the aim of his army was never to exterminate 
the Tutsis: 
  [Begin Jerome Bicamumpaka, identified as prime minister of 
Rwandan interim government, recording] There was no deliberate 
desire by the government to exterminate any ethnic group. I 
think this is when people have been talking of genocide. That 
there should be a war, that there should be a war that could be 
described as ethnic or otherwise--this is not the first time 
that such a phenomenon has been seen in the world. So there was 
an ethnic clash, it is true, but there was no deliberate desire 
by one group to exterminate another. [end recording] 
  [Fourniou] Yet, outside the hotel we found men from the 
regime's militia, the Interahamwe, the ones responsible for 
numerous massacres of Tutsis, the personal guard of the minister 
of defense, who has also retreated to Gisenyi. At the head of 
40,000 men, for him the enemy is not only the RPF [Rwandan 
Patriotic Front] and the Tutsis: 
  [Begin recording] [Augustin Bizimana, identified as defense 
minister of the Rwandan interim government] I am not saying that 
we are just fighting the RPF. We are fighting Uganda. 
  [Fourniou] You consider you are at war with Uganda? 
  [Bizimana] With Uganda, yes. As minister of defense I can 
say this quite openly. We are at war with Uganda. We know that 
there is support from Belgium. We know the Americans--initially 
and wrongly, they were mistaken--supported the action by the 
RPF. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Three hundred Senegalese soldiers, who will join 
French troops, have arrived in Goma, the operational base 
established by France in eastern Zaire. The Senegalese troops 
are the first and perhaps the only troops of an African country 
to join the Turquoise force, the operation launched by France in

  [Text] Kinshasa, 25 Jun (AFP) -- Zaire's radical opposition 
and its press organs today continued to sharply criticize French 
intervention in Rwanda. 
  The government team formed in August 1992 by Mr. Etienne 
Tshisekedi, which continues to claim to be the "legitimate 
government of Zaire," published a communique which "strongly 
condemns this criminal and neocolonialist intervention," 
considered "an insult to the whole of Africa." The communique, 
which described itself as a report "on a cabinet meeting held on 
23 June under the chairmanship of Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi, prime 
minister and head of government," also condemns "the violation 
of Zairian territory by French troops." 
  Pro-opposition newspapers have condemned the French 
intervention with very critical headlines and commentaries. 
Writing under the heading, "The Recolonization Has Begun," LE 
PHARE lashes out: "Beware of the Somalia and Vietnam Syndromes." 
LE POTENTIEL reported on its front page: "Invasion of Rwanda 
From Zaire," while LE TEMPETE DES TROPIQUES calls on the 
national and international community not to fall into "the trap" 
(....) of all-out disinformation" and not to see "in French 
fascism a mission of good omen."

  [Text] A spokesman for the United Somali Congress [USC] 
said that today the Somali National Alliance [SNA] soldiers 
loyal to Mohamed Farah Aidid today launched attacks reopening 
old scars in Makka and Madina Districts in Mogadishu. The 
spokesman said the fighting was going on around an area adjacent 
to Gezira Beach and near Madina hospital. 
  The spokesman said that by launching the flagrant attacks, 
the SNA had broken the UN-brokered cease-fire agreement signed 
in March 1992 by the two USC factions and the SNA in order to 
bring peace to Mogadishu, the Addis Ababa agreement of 22 March 
1993, the Hirab community agreement stipulating no further civil 
war and the Nairobi agreement to which 15 Somali organizations 
were signatories. 
  The spokesman wishes to inform officials of UN Operation in 
Somalia II, the USC communities, the Alliance of 12 [Somali 
Salvation Alliance, headed by Ali Mahdi Mohamed], and the 
peace-loving Somali people that the SNA has broken the peace 
agreement, and adds that the SNA will be held responsible for 
any problems arising from the fighting it has sparked off. 
  In light of the fighting, the spokesman has called on those 
forces fighting for the defense of Somalia's honor and 
sovereignty to be extra alert and to prepare to counter the 
SNA's provocation and aggression. Listeners, we will 
communicate to you any new developments in our later bulletins.

  [Text] A spokesman for the Ministry of Information and 
Culture has categorically denied a report broadcast last night 
by the BBC saying the fighting in Mogadishu was sparked off by 
the Somali Salvation Alliance [SSA] attack on the Somali 
National Alliance [SNA]. The spokesman described the BBC report 
as baseless and devoid of truth. He said the BBC had made it a 
habit to broadcast nonexistent stories in order to confuse 
international opinion. 
  The spokesman for the Ministry of Information and Culture 
once again made it clear to the international community and 
peace-loving people that the SNA was responsible for the ongoing 
fighting in some parts of Mogadishu city, namely Makka and 
Madina districts. In conclusion, the spokesman said relief 
operations in the city had not been jeopardized by the fighting 
as claimed by the BBC. He said the BBC had selfish interests to 
fulfill by spreading such a story.

  [Text] A statement issued by the United Somali Congress, 
USC, urged the entire Somali community to collectively confront 
the instability begun by the Somali National Alliance, SNA, in 
Mogadishu town. The USC added that the SNA has made a habit of 
creating friction among the general public living in Mogadishu, 
using ill-informed persons, in order to achieve its objectives. 
The statement further added that the USC constantly opposes 
shedding of blood and creating enmity and confrontation among 
the general public and Somali people. This has become the 
custom of the SNA. 
  The statement appealed to the international community, and 
especially the Somali people, to confront any groups aiming to 
hamper the ongoing reconciliation and peace of the Somali 
people. The USC believes in the principle of searching for peace 
and peaceful co-existence of the Somali people.

  [Text] A spokesman for the Somali National Alliance, SNA, 
has stated that groups of troublemakers opposed to stability and 
peace in the country are busy creating a situation which could 
lead to war. He said these groups are arming themselves in 
preparation for war. The spokesman said the groups were the 
same ones which perpetrated terrorist acts and relied on foreign 
assistance. He said the objectives of the groups are: 
  1. To ensure that pacification does not take place among 
communities in the central regions, including the Hiiraan 
region, and also to ensure that the recently concluded Kismaayo 
agreement, which was signed by communities in the Jubbada Hoose 
region, is not implemented and; 
  2. To create insecurity, with the aim of ensuring that the 
proposed national conference in Mogadishu does not take place. 
The conference was proposed in the Nairobi agreement, was 
witnessed by international organizations such as the United 
Nations, the OAU, and leaders from friendly countries, who would 
like peace and harmony to return to Somalia. 
  For these and other reasons, the SNA spokesman said, the 
groups are trying to bring about a situation in which peace and 
dialogue are not possible. In light of this, the SNA tells the 
world that it will not be responsible for any consequences in 
the country arising from war-mongering and insecurity. The SNA 
once again appeals to the Somali people to guard against being 
used to fight each other, and to strive to maintain peace and 
stability in Mogadishu and throughout the country, the spokesman 
concluded.

  [Text] The Council of State has expressed its horror at the 
news that, during the night of 22 June, a number of innocent 
displaced Liberians at the displaced people's center in the 
vicinity of [place name indistinct] outside Monrovia were 
brutally slaughtered by a group of persons said to belong to a 
faction of ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in 
Liberia]. 
  In a statement on the incident, Councilor Phillip Banks, who 
has [words indistinct] for the Ministry of Justice, condemned 
the killings, noting that such acts not only violate the Cotonou 
accord, but are wanton violations of several international human 
rights conventions to which Liberia has subscribed, as well as 
the violation of human rights of innocent unarmed civilians. 
  The councilman further noted that there can be no 
justification for the barbaric atrocities committed against 
unarmed, helpless civilians. The council, he said, has 
therefore instructed the Ministry of Justice to launch a 
full-scale investigation into the incident, and to promptly 
bring the perpetrators to justice. 
  Inveighing the directives of the Ministry of Justice, 
Councilor Banks stated that the violators must be subjected to 
trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity. He called on 
the Ministry of Justice to put necessary machinery in place for 
that purpose. The council, he noted, will not countenance such 
acts against the citizens of Liberia. 
  The councilor noted further that while the council has not 
pursued persons who violated the human rights of the Liberian 
people prior to the Cotonou accord and since the council's 
seating, it has no intention of permitting the perpetration of 
crimes against innocent Liberians by any person or a group of 
persons, or of allowing those who have committed such crimes to 
go unpunished. 
  Such war crimes, the council emphasized, are not covered by 
the amnesty provisions in the Cotonou Accord and therefore those 
identified as being responsible for the perpetration of such 
crimes must be formally charged, and when convicted should be 
bear the full punishments prescribed by the relevant 
international conventions and the penal laws of Liberia. This, 
he said, includes punishment by death. 
  Meanwhile, the councilman has instructed Justice Ministry to 
have the area where the incident occurred and other areas of the 
city securely covered and monitored, so as to avoid a repetition 
of the incident. The council, he said, is calling upon ECOMOG 
[Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring 
Group] to (?fully) coordinate with and involve Liberians [words 
indistinct], especially personnel of the Liberia National 
Police, to ensure the maximum protection of all citizens and 
residents in areas under the control of ECOMOG and the Liberia 
National Transitional Government.

  [Text] Niamey, 26 Jun (AFP) -- Niger President Mahamane 
Ousmane announced in Niamey today that Niger is prepared to send 
troops to participate in the French military and humanitarian 
operation launched on 23 June in Rwanda if France makes the 
request. 
  At a news conference, President Mahamane Ousmane stated that 
they were prepared to send "a contingent or any other form of 
contribution depending on the exact request that will be made to 
us." 
  He added: "The French initiative deserves to be supported. 
We have given it our moral and political support. At this 
stage, no other request has been made to us." 
  President Mahamane Ousmane made the statement at the 
departure ceremony for Burkinabe President Blaise Compaore, who 
left Niamey this morning at the end of a 24-hour visit. 
  When interviewed on his position on the French operation, 
President Compaore expressed his "support" for the operation but 
explained that Burkina Faso did "not have the means" to 
contribute materially. He said France was "forced" to make this 
decision due to the "resignation of the international 
community," including Africa. 
  He added: "What are Africans doing? People are killing each 
other, but Africans are doing nothing to intervene. That was 
why France was forced to make that decision." 
  He further stated: "Whether the solution comes from Africans 
or from others, we think that if anything can be done to save 
people now, it should be done."

  [Text] Lagos, 24 Jun (AFP) -- Moshood Abiola, Nigeria's 
main opposition figure, today initiated an action at the Supreme 
Court challenging his arrest and demanding his release, the 
GUARDIAN EXPRESS daily newspaper reports. In a statement read 
on his behalf by Gani Fawehinhmi, a renowned Lagos lawyer, the 
Muslim multimillionaire who was arrested in the night of 23 June 
and transferred to the federal capital, Abuja, asked the Supreme 
Court to rule that he be released. He described his arrest as a 
gross violation of his rights to personal freedom as laid down 
by the 1979 Constitution and the African Charter on Human Rights 
and the Rights of Peoples. Moshood Abiola, who declared himself 
"president of Nigeria and commander in chief of the Armed 
Forces" on 11 June, also maintains that his arrest and detention 
interfere with his right to participate in the country's 
political life, the evening newspaper reported. The hearing has 
been set for 26 June.

  [Text] Lagos, 25 June (PANA) -- A Nigerian federal high 
court in Lagos on Friday [24 June] ordered the Nigerian police 
to produce detained millionaire politician, Moshood Abiola on 
Thursday. [sentence as received] 
  The order by Justice Tajudeen Odunowo on the police 
inspector-general, Ibrahim Coomassie, followed an application by 
lawyer Kolawole Ajayi on behalf of Abiola. 
  The judge fixed hearing on the application on the same day, 
Thursday, after he rejected Ajayi's plea to discharge Abiola 
from police custody. 
  Another Lagos federal high court is expected Monday to begin 
hearing yet another suit by Abiola challenging his arrest and 
detention on 23 June. 
  The suit was filed by Lagos lawyer, Gani Fawehinhmi, who 
told 
the court that Abiola's arrest was unconstitutional and a breach 
of his fundamental human rights. 
  Pro-democracy groups in Nigeria, including the National 
Democratic Coalition and the Campaign for Democracy, which are 
leading the campaign for the military to surrender power to 
Abiola, have protested the arrest of the millionaire, who 
claimed victory in Nigeria's 12 June 1993 election, which was 
annulled by the country's military. 
  Meanwhile, there were indications that Abiola, who 
reportedly 
proclaimed himself president of Nigeria on 11 June, could go on 
trial either in Lagos or Abuja, next week. 
  But in an interview with PANA on Saturday, the deputy 
inspector- general of police operations, Nuhu Aliyu, declined to 
confirm the report, but said that the police were trying to 
ensure law and order throughout the country. 
  Aliyu said the police would tighten security against those 
he 
called "paid thugs," who may try to cause a breach of public 
peace. 
  Apart from reported scattered protests in Lagos, especially 
in Ikeja, near Abiola's residence, north of Lagos, on Thursday 
and Friday, no major incidents were reported in the country.

  [Text] Well, all week police were looking for Chief Abiola. 
Now his supporters and family are looking for the chief. His 
whereabouts since his arrest have been unknown. There were 
various reports that he had been flown off to Abuja and that he 
stayed in a police cell in Lagos. On the line, Mary Harper 
asked Chief Abiola's eldest child, Mrs. Lola Abiola Edewo what 
the family's information was. 
  [Begin recording] [Edewo] I have no idea as to where he is. 
The last we saw of him was on the day that he was arrested 
because I was one of the people who escorted him as far as where 
he was taken, which was in Lagos here. 
  [Harper] Where exactly did you follow him to? 
  [Edewo] We followed him to Alagbon, the FIB, which is the 
police-cum-security headquarters. 
  [Harper] And do you have any idea where he was taken to from 
this police headquarters? 
  [Edewo] Even though we were all there, we didn't know when 
he 
was moved. It was much later, about four in the morning, 
because we were all out keeping a night vigil. Then one of the 
police people who had come to arrest him from home said we 
better leave because he is no longer here, that they've taken 
him to Abuja. 
  [Harper] Have you been in touch with the police since his 
arrest? 
  [Edewo] Yes. I was there about half a dozen times yesterday 
to the same site where he was taken where we had followed him to 
just to double check that information. Each time I went I was 
told, he is still in Abuja. On the sixth trip the policeman at 
the reception there said to me, Madam, he is still in Abuja, he 
is not here. Don't bother. 
  [Harper] Do you have any indication when your father might 
be 
brought to trial? 
  [Edewo] Huh, nobody is telling us anything. I have no idea.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Yet another group in Nigeria has come out in 
support of Chief Abiola, the self-proclaimed president who was 
detained on Thursday [23 June] by the military government. This 
is the oil workers union, Nupeng [National Union of Petroleum 
and Natural Gas Workers], who are demanding Abiola's release, 
and are threatening to go on strike. But the ruling council, 
led by General Sani Abacha, is refusing to recognize Abiola's 
claims to the presidency, based on the abortive election held 
last June. On the line, Dan Isaacs asked Nupeng's secretary 
general, Frank Ovie Kokori, how much support there is for the 
strike: 
  [Begin recording] [Kokori] We have been able to go round the 
whole country and got the mandate of all the zonal councils of 
Nupeng saying that if Abiola is not released -- not only just 
being released -- that he should actualize his mandate, and that 
the present head of state, who is the leader the junta, should 
work out a program for handing over peacefully to Abiola within 
the next seven days. 
  [Isaacs] So are you and the union threatening to do if the 
government does not accede to these demands within the seven 
days you talk about? 
  [Kokori, laughing] Normally, as a trade union we only have 
one option: the last option, which is the historical role of 
trade unions all over the world, and that is resorting to 
industrial action. I mean, an industrial action that will be 
sustained by all means until the people on the other side will 
see reason with us in the country. 
  [Isaacs] Why do you think the government should take your 
action seriously? After all, you have taken industrial action 
in the past and been forced to backtrack and give up. 
  [Kokori] No, we never gave up. Nupeng never gave up, you 
know that, and what happened was that the present head of state 
called Nupeng at that time and assured Nupeng that the issue of 
June 12 would be revisited, but the whole thing became a fraud. 
The government deceived every person.... 
  [Isaacs, interrupting] But in reality, you know that 
industrial action like this will (?last) a little while, and in 
the end the government will win because it has the power. 
  [Kokori] Well, that is your own view as a pressman. I am 
laborist [as heard] and I have been in labor struggles for 
years. (?It is only) an industrial union that could paralyze the 
soul of the Nigerian economy. 
  [Isaacs] So (?your main intention) is to bring the Nigerian 
economy to its knees? 
  [Kokori] I don't know. You predict that, but we say the 
people themselves are not happy with....[pauses] A man who is 
given the mandate, he is now being used and he is now being 
tortured as the underdog, whereas people who never had the 
mandate are now enjoying or ruling the country under the barrel 
of the gun. It is unfair. I think you will agree with me. 
  [Isaacs] And your industrial action will continue until the 
government says it will honor the June 12, or until it [words 
indistinct] the June 12 presidential election of last year? 
  [Kokori] If the way you are going [words indistinct], and 
those of us who are speaking to you now, we don't even know what 
will happen to us tomorrow. So we are on a struggle, on a 
historic political struggle. So it is not a [word indistinct], 
you will agree with me. It is a serious struggle we are all in 
(?for). [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The pressure on General Abacha's military 
government in Nigeria from opposition pro-democrat groups is 
beginning to rise. It follows the arrest of self-declared 
president, Chief Moshood Abiola, yesterday. Chief Abiola is 
widely believed to have won last June's annulled presidential 
election. [passage omitted] Now the protests are beginning, as 
Sola Odunfa reports from Lagos. 
  [Begin Odunfa recording] Leading the protests is the 
National 
Democratic Coalition, Nadeco, which has appealed to the 
international community to show and intensify its support for 
the restoration of democracy in Nigeria under a government 
headed by Chief Abiola. [passage omitted] 
  However, the government is not without support. The most 
prominent of its supporters so far is former military head of 
state, Gen. Yakubu Gowon, who was toppled in 1976. He defended 
Chief Abiola's arrest on the grounds that the government had a 
duty to maintain law and order. He appealed to Nigerians to 
support the national constitutional conference opening in Abuja 
on Monday [27 June] as the only way to terminate military rule 
permanently. 
  Meanwhile, the Federal High Court sitting in Lagos has 
ordered that all six former senators charged with treason be 
remanded in police custody. The court revoked the bail it 
granted earlier to three of them, including former Senate 
President Ameh Ebute. Their trial has been adjourned to 6 July. 
The three others, a former civilian state governor, Segun 
Osoba, and two retired air force officers, charged with forming 
an illegal political association were released on bail. Their 
own trial will begin on 12 July. [end recording]

  [Text] Lagos, 24 Jun (AFP) -- Police armoured vehicles were 
posted on main roads in Lagos on Friday [24 June] as authorities 
boosted security following the arrest of Moshood Abiola, 
believed to have won Nigeria's free elections, local residents 
said. Some police armoured vehicles were stationed along 
Ikorodu Road, a main thoroughfare that crosses the city, and in 
the residential Oshodi district, as well as along Western 
Avenue, a major artery into the commercial nerve-centre of the 
city, they said. 
  The move came after Abiola was picked up from his residence 
Thursday by policemen after addressing a public rally in Lagos 
attended by about 2,000 people. Abiola was arrested after 
vowing on June 11 to set up an alternative government, ahead of 
the anniversary of presidential elections of June 12, 1993 which 
were annulled by the military government. 
  Officials said that the extra security might be connected to 
a visit by Nigerian leader General Sani Abacha to military 
officers and men at the Ikeja military cantonment, as part of 
his efforts to rally military support to his government. But 
groups of policemen, armed with guns, teargas canisters and 
batons were also seen Friday morning -- stationed about 100 
metres (yards) apart -- on some other major Lagos streets, 
particularly in trouble-prone areas of northern Lagos, residents 
said. They also noticed a sudden increase in numbers of armed 
soldiers usually deployed to protect government agencies such as 
the central bank, the national radio and television stations, 
and the national telephone and electricity companies. 
  Newspapers here Friday published the photograph of Kudiratu, 
a wife of Chief Abiola, leading a group of peaceful protesters 
on Thursday in some streets around the Lagos residence of the 
politician in Ikeja. The GUARDIAN reported that hundreds of 
people in Ibadan, capital of western Oyo State, on Thursday 
booed and jeered General Abacha. 
  The head of state, accompanied by his service chiefs, has 
been paying visits to other major military formations in various 
parts of the country since Wednesday.

  [Text] The head of state, General Sani Abacha, today 
rounded off his tour of military formations in the country with 
a visit to Lagos State. 
  Addressing members of the Armed Forces and the police at the 
Ikeja Military Cantonment, Gen. Abacha said his visit was to 
emphasize the importance of the forthcoming constitutional 
conference. He said the conference would examine central issues 
such as revenue allocation, alleged cases of marginalization by 
ethnic groups, power sharing, as well as the suitable form of 
government to be adopted. Gen. Abacha said that from past 
experiences, the presidential system of government was very 
[word indistinct] and quite inconsistent with the present 
economic realities of the moment. The head of state assured 
military personnel in Lagos State that urgent measures had 
already been taken to ensure their welfare. 
  On Liberia, Gen. Abacha said Nigeria would soon pull out of 
the West African Peacekeeping Force, ECOMOG, in Liberia. Gen. 
Abacha said now that the United Nations had indicated its 
intention to send peacekeepers to Liberia, it was natural that 
Nigeria pulled out. He said Nigeria had contributed and, 
indeed, sacrificed a lot of human and material resources to 
maintain peace in that country. The head of state confirmed 
that Nigeria had begun the reduction of its military strength in 
the ECOMOG, saying further contingents would not be sent to that 
country. Gen. Abacha expressed optimism that the Liberian 
warring factions would solve their problems in their own way.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Edyth Bulbring] </F>
  [Text] The projects President Nelson Mandela announced to 
kickstart the Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP] 
would be up and running within the target he set of 100 days, 
Minister Without Portfolio Jay Naidoo said this week. Mr Naidoo 
said his RDP team was finalising the planning of projects for 
urban renewal and rural development. 
  He said that while the RDP team had not settled all the 
projects to account for the R2.5bn [rand] allocated to the RDP 
this year, initial figures on some of the expenditure had been 
finalised. 
  These would be released after further consultation with 
other 
ministers involved in the projects. 
  He said the projects needed to be implemented in an 
integrated way involving several other ministries and were not 
piece-meal projects. 
  For example, programmes for urban renewal would involve 
cleaning up the townships at the same time as restoring services 
and putting in infrastructure. The focus was public works 
programmes. 
  The projects envisaged for rural development also included a 
focus on health and education. 
  He had met on two occasions with all the premiers and task 
teams would be sent back to the provinces to hold further talks 
on implementing the projects. 
  In his budget speech, Mr Keys said that the government had 
pencilled in a further R35bn over the next four budgets for 
transfer to the RDP fund. 
  These fiscal injections represented only a part of the RDP 
in 
its entirety and would be implemented by contributions from 
other governments and from the private sector. 
  He warned, however, that the RDP could be vulnerable to two 
failures. The first was if the overall level of expenditure 
rose. The second was that if sound and attractive programmes 
were not produced, the departments would not be motivated to 
bring about future diversions of spending.

<F P=106> [Report by Peter de Ionno] </F>
  [Text] The SANDF [South African National Defence Force] has 
reduced its order for Pilatus trainer aircraft from 75 to 60 in 
a package of cutbacks designed to pay for the defence force's 
R650-million [rand] contribution to the Reconstruction and 
Development Plan [RDP]. 
  No army bases are being closed in the coming year, but the 
rapid reaction force will be cut by at least half, severely 
reducing South Africa's ability to project force in a crisis or 
extend help in the form of foreign peace-keeping missions, say 
defence force spokesmen. 
  Training programmes are being shrunk and annual large-scale 
conventional battle exercises may be cancelled this year. 
  An across-the-board decision to put a hold on major 
equipment- development programmes short of commitment to orders 
will hit the already stressed defence industry. 
  In addition to the R650-million contribution, the SANDF is 
expected to provide a further "in kind" donation to the RDP in 
the form of engineering equipment and training resources worth 
about R350-million. Discussions on these provisions began in 
May, but were postponed because the government could not 
identify specific requirements. 
  The funding cut defied a defence headquarters bottom-line 
spelt out in a crisp policy document issued before the Budget, 
"that a further reduction in defence spending is not feasible". 
The reduction is a clear signal to hawks that they can expect 
their wings to be clipped still further in line with public 
expectations and world trends. 
  In the document, defence force chief General Georg Meiring 
outlines reduced armoured vehicle and unacceptable anti-aircraft 
capabilities, halted production of the G6 cannon and drastic 
cuts in air power were already undermining the SANDF's ability 
to ensure the country's defence. 
  Acknowledging that the absence of a foreseeable threat 
within 
five years only demands low force levels, the SANDF's final word 
is that "defence spending will have to increase in future years." 
  With plans to increase RDP allocations progressively from 
departmental savings coupled to expected integration costs 
remaining at least R1-billion until 1997 and the 
still-to-be-calculated costs of retrenchments at senior level, 
it is difficult to see where the generals expect extra money to 
be found. 
  Lieutenant-General B.S. Raubenheimer, SANDF Chief of Staff, 
Finances, says the funding cuts of 50 percent over the past six 
years have reduced the military to an "affordable force".

  [Text] Durban -- SA [South Africa] should establish a 
reconstruction and development bond to swiftly secure an inflow 
of billions of investment dollars, SA ambassador to the US Harry 
Schwarz said yesterday. 
  He said there would be no flood of US investment into the 
economy or the JSE [Johannesburg Stock Exchange] until SA had 
shown a solid record of growth and stability. 
  But there was burgeoning demand in the US for "socially 
desirable" investments. 
  An RDP [Reconstruction Development Programme] bond--which 
has 
been mooted by government--would provide an ideal channel for 
such funds, Schwarz told the SA Property Owners' Association 
convention. "One fund management institution I spoke to, with 
R500bn [rand] under its management, indicated that R25bn of 
these funds had been marked for socially desirable investments. 
  "I wish I had an SA electrification or housing bond which I 
could market to US investors. I am confident it would attract a 
lot of interest." 
  Trade and Industry Minister Trevor Manuel has said that 
government was considering establishing an RDP bond. The bond 
would not form part of the RDP fund, which currently stands at 
R2.5bn. It is thought that the fund will get about R3bn in 
foreign aid over the next two years. Schwarz said it was 
imperative that foreign exchange controls be scrapped to 
encourage investment. "There will always be a reason not to 
bite the bullet, but if we are going to get the economy right we 
cannot artificially keep funds in SA. The rand must find its 
correct level based on criteria other than political." 
  Overseas investors might prefer entering SA at a discount. 
But on reflection they realised that the vagaries of local 
share and bond prices, and the political and economic situation, 
were enough to handle without a two-tier currency. 
  Schwarz said SA also had to contend with strong opinions in 
the US cabinet that SA should not receive foreign aid. "There 
is a belief that SA doesn't need aid as it is rich, there are 
communists in the government and if aid is forwarded, the US 
should receive mineral or other rights in return." 
  However this view was held by only some members of the 
Clinton administration, which was generally extremely supportive 
of SA's process of democratisation and the economy's 
reconstruction. 
  Rand Merchant Bank executive director Rudolf Gouws said he 
was pleased government had not created an RDP bond. A bond 
formed specifically to raise funds for the RDP would confuse the 
issue. It was clear from the Budget that the RDP was not viewed 
as an "add on", and the diversion of money to fund the RDP meant 
government expenditure was unlikely to soar.

<F P=106> [Article by Greta Steyn] </F>
  [Text] Cape Town -- Government was already in a debt trap 
in terms of the strict definition of the concept, Reserve Bank 
Deputy Governor Jaap Meijer said yesterday. 
  He told Parliament's joint committee on finance SA [South 
Africa] could still find a way out of the trap. "It does not 
matter that much that we have hit our head against the wall of 
the bunker, as it is still easy to get out. There are ways out 
of the bunker." 
  Meijer and Bank Governor Chris Stals appeared before the 
committee to explain the Bank's monetary policy stance. They 
fielded questions on the Bank's conservative position on the 
deficit, IMF conditionality and the reasons behind SA's large 
capital outflows. 
  Stals signalled that a reduction in interest rates was not 
on 
the card in the short term, as SA's balance of payments was 
still too fragile. Capital outflows, low savings and high 
fiscal deficits had recently placed upward pressure on interest 
rates, he said. 
  He expressed concern over the "very high" level of the 
deficit, saying it would start crowding out the private sector 
when the economic upswing gained momentum. This was in response 
to a question from ANC MP Max Sisulu, who questioned the 
"magical" 6 percent of GDP level for the deficit. 
  Stals was encouraged by the reduction in the deficit from 
6.9 
percent of GDP to 6.6 percent, but repeatedly warned that a 
borrowing requirement of 6 percent would become progressively 
difficult to finance once the private sector's demand for credit 
picked up. 
  SA was borrowing to pay interest rather than to invest. 
Government's interest bill was already 5.5 percent of GDP. But 
sluggish economic conditions had added to government's 
difficulties by putting a lid on revenue growth -- a situation 
that would change. 
  On interest rates, he hoped there would be capital inflows 
in 
the second half, so that it would "not be necessary to raise 
Bank rate". If SA experienced a capital inflow over the next six 
months, it could lead to a "slight decline" in interest rates. 
  Stals also disclosed the extent to which SA's foreign 
exchange reserves were threatened in the run-up to the election 
and said the situation remained worrisome. 
  The Bank had arranged R11bn [rand] in shortterm foreign 
credit lines, of which R8.5bn had been used in the first week 
of May. SA's reserves were battered right up to the 
inauguration of President Nelson Mandela. 
  However, there had been a subsequent improvement which had 
enabled the Bank to cut its foreign exchange "overdrafts" to 
about R6.5bn. He hoped the borrowings could be reduced to zero 
by year-end. 
  Commenting on the financial rand, he said deposits of about 
R4bn in the money market would have to be run down before the 
Bank could consider recommending the scrapping of the dual 
currency system. Other prerequisites were a narrowing in the 
discount between the finrand and the commercial rand to 10 
percent from the present level of about 23 percent, and a 
substantial increase in the country's reserves. 
  The finrand deposits had already fallen, from about R8bn 18 
months ago, and the discount had narrowed. He put the finrand 
pool -- non-resident investment mainly in SA gilts and equities 
-- at about $15bn.

<F P=106> [Report by Sven Lunsche] </F>
  [Text] The government's debt-financing policies are under 
the spotlight after the Budget revived fears that SA [South 
Africa] is heading toward a debt trap. 
  Finance Minister Derek Keys received good news from 
taxpayers, whose contributions in April and May -- the first two 
months of the current fiscal year -- were substantially over 
budget. On the other hand he has been confronted with Reserve 
Bank criticism that excessive state spending has pushed SA into 
a "debt trap", a fact which he vigorously disputes. 
  Figures released by the Central Statistical Service on 
Friday 
show that revenues from taxes and customs duties in April and 
May at R14.2-billion [rand] to R20.4-billion, leaving a deficit 
before borrowing of R6.14-billion (1993: R7.84-billion). 
  Mr Keys has budgeted for a 10.2 percent rise in spending to 
R135.1-billion and a 11.2 percent increase in revenue to R105.8- 
billion for the year as a whole. 
  "While there are some technical factors coming into play, 
higher corporate earnings and rising consumer spending should 
ensure that the government's revenue targets are easily met this 
year," says Mike Brown, economist at stockbrokers Frankel Pollak 
Vinderine. He is, however, concerned that the new departments 
will not be able to stick to spending targets, which could raise 
the deficit above the budgeted R29.3-billion (6.6 percent of 
GDP). 
  Financing the deficit, the R15-billion debt of the former 
TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states and 
R7-billion losses related to gold and foreign exchange reserves 
will lift state debt to about R244-billion by February 1995 -- 
just under 55 percent of projected GDP. In March this year the 
debt totalled R192- billion, or 48 percent of GDP, according to 
the Reserve Bank's latest Quarterly Bulletin. 
  The mounting debt burden and the high deficit have already 
placed SA in a debt trap, says the Bank's deputy Governor, Jaap 
Meijer. Using the rigorous IMF formulation of a debt trap, he 
says that the government needs to borrow money to pay the 
interest on its debt burden, which 1994/95 will amount to 
R24.6-billion. 
  Interests payments on government debt have risen by 19 
percent yearly over the past five years and constitute the 
second largest expenditure item in the Budget, after education. 
  If the proportion of interest payment to total spending 
continues to rise, spending on other sectors, such as education, 
health and housing, will have to be progressively reduced. "A 
continuation of this trend is unsustainable and the government 
will have to take corrective measures," Dr Meijer says. 
  Appearing before Parliament's joint standing committee on 
finance on Thursday, Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals also 
warned that the high deficit, capital outflows and low savings 
were placing upward pressure on interest rates. 
  Dr Ernie van der Merwe, head of the Bank's economic 
department, says, however, that government debt has not yet 
reached the levels where a further increase cannot be prevented, 
either by higher taxes or a decline in spending. "I believe 
that Mr Keys' commitment to a restructured tax system and a real 
cut in state spending will ensure that we will not be caught in 
a debt trap," he says. 
  Dr van der Merwe also points out that the ratio of public 
debt to GDP at 54 percent is not excessive in international 
terms. The European Union had prescribed a ratio of 60 percent 
in the Maastricht treaty. 
  Mr Keys dismisses fears of a debt trap. In an interview this 
week he said that international guidelines were not strictly 
applicable in SA, "where a sizeable proportion of the debt -- 
the deficit on the state pension and provident funds -- is owned 
by the civil service".

<F P=106> [Editorial published in English] </F>
  [Text] The Government's decision to raise the fuel price 
has again angered many consumers. 
  The fuel price bears no relation to what its market price 
should be. The reason the price of fuel is so high is because 
it is deliberately inflated by Government, in part to fill its 
own coffers, and in part because it is obligated towards 
protecting inefficient state subsidised industries, such as 
Mossgas [Mossel Bay Gas Project] and Sasol [South Africa Coal, 
Oil, and Gas Corporation]. 
  Rather than preserving an array of indirect or "hidden" 
taxes 
-- such as reflected in the fuel price, amongst other prices -- 
government should make taxes as direct as possible. 
  At least then the taxes would be more visible, and people 
would have a better idea of how much government costs them. 
People would no longer be temporarily confused and anguished by 
such contrivances as a sharp increase in the state determined 
fuel price. 
  The state could then still use its direct tax revenues for 
chosen areas of investment. 
  One of the mandarins of the old apartheid system, Mineral 
and 
Energy Affairs Minister Pik Botha, opposes real deregulation of 
the fuel price because he believes it will lead to job losses. 
  This is, basically, an argument that economic inefficiency 
should be tolerated as long as some people make money and are 
employed as a result. 
  It is a factor which must be borne in mind when approaching 
deregulation. But alone it is not convincing. After all, on 
this basis, any kind of activity may be justified, including 
digging earth works with teaspoons. 
  Job creation must instead take place within a process of 
both 
wealth creation and development. Let the market function 
freely, whilst the state directs tax revenues into development. 
  The fact is that Sasol and Mossgas are white elephants. They 
were strategic industries for an economically isolated apartheid 
state. 
  They are no longer important in the way they were. Like 
other huge, inefficient, state-erected industries elsewhere in 
the world, they must now make the transition towards the market. 
  In doing so they may well have a market edge in certain 
areas, and provide goods and services which consumers want, at 
cheaper prices than competitors. If so they will remain viable 
enterprises -- in these areas. But other functions probably 
deserve to be wound down. The funds released, as stated, could 
then be directed into productive avenues -- avenues which 
provide both jobs and economic growth we need. 
  Concomitant fuel deregulation would mean consumers would no 
longer be subsidising organisations which should not be in 
business. The immediate effect would be a huge drop in our fuel 
bill.

<F P=106> [By Stephen Laufer] </F>
  [Text] Senior government officials are squaring up for a 
battle over control of the intelligence services, ahead of a 
presidential proclamation integrating state agencies with those 
of the ANC and the former homelands. To be called the National 
Intelligence Agency, the new service will operate for an interim 
period prior to a fundamental reorganisation of the intelligence 
services. 
  The high-level political tug of war comes amid reports that 
President Nelson Mandela has agreed to cede control of 
intelligence matters to his deputy, F.W. de Klerk, in an 
apparent barter for ANC control of the police and the South 
African National Defence Force. Senior sources say "De Klerk is 
attempting to grab control of intelligence," with Mandela -- who 
is officially minister of intelligence -- still studying the 
implications of delegating his authority. 
  Intelligence officials familiar with the integration debate 
are understood to have advised Mandela against including 
intelligence in the national unity trade-off. They fear that 
unless the intelligence services report to the president, they 
could continue to function in a partisan manner. Inclined 
towards the NP [National Party] by tradition, they could become 
a powerful weapon in De Klerk's hands in the run-up to the next 
election. 
  Senior ANC officials have indicated that structures 
currently 
being finalised will ensure presidential control of the shadow 
services. The new intelligence dispensation is likely to 
include four agencies. 
  Military Intelligence will return to its classic role of 
information gathering and analysis on potential threats to the 
sovereignty and integrity of the country. Police intelligence 
could be restricted to information gathering on criminals, 
including international gun runners and drug dealers. 
  The current premier political intelligence service, the 
National Intelligence Service, is to be divided into two 
agencies, one responsible for domestic surveillance and 
analysis, the other involved in international work. It is 
unclear whether any or all of the agencies will have police 
powers such as the right of arrest, or whether the German model 
of a strict separation of powers will be followed. 
  A national intelligence co-ordinating mechanism, most 
probably a committee made up of the heads of all the agencies, 
will report to a state secretary for intelligence in the 
president's office. This is likely to be a political appointee, 
possibly ANC security chief Joe Nhlanhla if Mandela holds on to 
intelligence.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Edyth Bulbring] </F>
  [Text] Promotions in the police over the past year are to 
be reviewed in the next few weeks following complaints about 
irregularities and dissatisfaction with standards. The 
discovery of irregularities would lead to the establishment of a 
commission of inquiry headed by a judge to assess, and if 
necessary, reverse promotions, according to the newly 
established police advisory team. 
  One of the irregular incidents known to the advisory team 
was 
a case in which members of the Transkei police force forced 
their superiors to promote them at gunpoint shortly after the 
election. These promotions were suspended, but there were also 
allegations of irregular promotions in some of the other police 
forces. 
  The 10-man advisory team, which met in Pretoria on Friday, 
must amalgamate the 11 police forces into one national police 
service. 
  A key issue which arose at the meeting was the criteria used 
by the different police forces to promote their members, and the 
advancement of members during the year before the election. 
The advisory team will recommend to Safety and Security 
Minister Sydney Mufamadi that these issues be investigated over 
the next few weeks. 
  A member of the team said one of the problems the team faced 
in rationalising the police forces was the different standards 
and criteria employed in promoting members. 
  Following an investigation, the team would finalise new 
standards for promotion. These would include new criteria for 
affirmative action. 
  Should the team discover gross irregularities, President 
Nelson Mandela was empowered by the constitution to establish a 
commission of inquiry to examine all promotions between April 
last year and September this year. The commission would have 
the power to confirm, reverse or amend these promotions.

  [Text] Defense Minister Joe Modise says he is willing to 
testify before the government's proposed commission on 
reconciliation and truth. Speaking in Cape Town, he said the 
ANC had nothing to hide and that everybody who was supposed to 
testify before the commission would do so. However, he added 
that he had said all that he needed to say in testimony to an 
internal ANC commission last year. 
  Mr. Modise was among ANC leaders named in that report as 
having perpetrated or allowed human rights abuses in ANC 
detention camps in Angola. Mr. Modise's statement is a sequel 
to a request by nine former generals of the SADF [South African 
Defense Force] and the police that senior ANC members set an 
example by giving evidence before the truth commission. The 
group, including Freedom Front Leader Constand Viljoen, is 
demanding fairness toward all parties regarding past misdeeds.

  [Text] There's growing concern in right-wing circles to the 
proposed truth commission. A group of former police and defense 
force generals have called on ANC members to disclose their role 
in what they termed past acts of terror. The newly-appointed 
deputy defense minister and former MK [Spear of the Nation -- 
ANC military wing] intelligence chief, Ronnie Kasrils, has 
dismissed the nine generals' call as a red herring. Ronel van 
Zyl reports. 
  [Begin recording] [Van Zyl] Freedom Front leader Constand 
Viljoen, the only one of the group who is in Parliament, 
seriously questions the merits of the truth commission. 
  [Viljoen] We in this regard feel that it is necessary for us 
in the interest of our own people, but also in the general 
interest of the country, for peace for our country, that we 
should warn the people against such a commission which might 
have the opposite effect which the ANC has in mind about the 
commission. 
  [Van Zyl] He said equal treatment should be meted out to 
anyone who committed crimes in the political struggle. Mr. 
Kasrils, who was sworn in as deputy defense minister this 
afternoon, described the general's statement as totally 
irrelevant. 
  [Kasrils] We stood for indemnity. We provided the 
information. Our slate is clean. That's why we've been 
insisting those who served apartheid must do likewise. 
  [Van Zyl] Mr. Kasrils' appointment follows a request from 
Defense Minister Joe Modise for additional senior personnel to 
run the Defense Ministry. Mr. Modise has indicated that he's 
prepared to testify before the truth commission if it's expected 
of him. [end recording]

  [Text] A prince of the Zulu royal family says about half of 
King Goodwill Zwelithini's royal family is currently leading a 
fugitive life, fearing that they will be murdered by the KwaZulu 
Police [KZP]. According to the prince, he has received several 
death threats from the KZP over the last few months. 
  These allegations are the latest development in the war of 
words between Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi and the 
Zulu royal family on the political and financial position of 
King Goodwill in the Inkatha-controlled regional government of 
KwaZulu. 
  Earlier this week members of the royal family issued a 
statement in which Mr. Buthelezi is accused of mudslinging to 
win Zulu support for his coalition with the ANC. 
  In turn, Mr. Buthelezi said that certain members of the 
royal 
family are trying to drive a wedge between him and King 
Zwelithini. 
  Political observers said the king has been trying to 
distance 
himself from Mr. Buthelezi since the April election.

<F P=106> [Report by Janine Lazarus] </F>
  [Excerpts] Police believe agents of Mosad -- the Israeli 
secret service -- assassinated a Johannesburg man because he was 
supplying Middle Eastern countries with hi-tech chemicals that 
could be used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons. The shock 
claim came from a senior police source this week during a 
WEEKEND STAR investigation into the brutal slaying almost three 
years ago of British immigrant Alan Kidger. 
  His horribly dismembered body was found in the boot of his 
luxury car, which had been abandoned in Soweto by car thieves. 
They had stolen the car from a Hillbrow street, unaware of its 
grisly contents. 
  The bizarre circumstances of his death -- the body also had 
been smeared with an oily, black substance -- baffled police. 
Media interest in the mysterious circumstances of the case 
intensified after the car belonging to the police's chief 
investigator was blown up by a limpet mine while parked in his 
driveway at home. 
  But now, for the first time, chief investigator 
Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Landman has revealed the 
internationally explosive nature of his inquiry. He is 
convinced the death had something to do with the murky world of 
secret deals related to weaponry. Kidger's involvement, in fact, 
could have become a threat to the international balance of power. 
  "We believe he was working for foreign governments and the 
nature of that work had something to do with the production of 
arms that required hi-tech chemicals," said Landman. 
  "Alan Kidger was involved in supplying these chemicals to 
Middle Eastern countries. The chemicals are used in the 
production of nuclear weapons. 
  "There is one thing for sure: this guy was dumped for a 
reason. 
  "He wasn't a gambler or involved in drugs. The murder was a 
hit aimed at sending a clear message. Nothing other than a hit. 
"It involved something only a government would be interested 
in." 
  Asked to respond to the claim of Mosad's role, a spokesman 
from the Israel Embassy said yesterday that it was the first 
time he had heard such a story. "It seems to be an imaginary 
story, and I cannot confirm it. I'm sure Mosad is not involved 
in any such activity." 
  Asked if he knew about all activities that Mosad were 
involved in, he replied: "No. Do you? 
  "I can assure you Mosad have not been involved in killing 
anyone in South Africa," he added. 
  South African police have been in touch with detectives in 
Britain, but no arrests have been made. The investigation, said 
Landman, will now switch to Europe and elsewhere. 
  "It is very important that the investigation continues, not 
only in South Africa, but in other countries because Kidger 
travelled extensively." 
  Described by police as one of the most gruesome murders on 
the Reef in years, 48-year-old Kidger was found with his torso, 
buttocks, arms and legs amputated in the boot of his car near 
Orlando Stadium on November 9 1991 -- two days after he went 
missing. 
  Two car thieves who had apparently stolen his white BMW 
728i, 
which had been dumped in Hillbrow, drove it to Soweto to remove 
the radio and speakers. Once there, they opened the boot and 
found the dismembered body. 
  A post-mortem established that Kidger died as a result of a 
blow to the head. There was virtually not a drop of blood left 
in his body. 
  "Who would go to such extreme lengths to do something like 
that?" asked Landman. "And why leave the body in Hillbrow as an 
advertisement? Was it a warning?" 
  The body had been "professionally" dismembered and the oily 
black substance that covered it contained what some chemical 
experts at the time though to be a high percentage of mercury. 
Landman said the substance, according to police forensics 
report, was alkyd resin -- a black substance used as isolator in 
paints with a high lead content. [passage omitted] 
  Kidger, a marketing manager for Thor Chemicals in Alberton 
-- 
an international chemical producing company -- was "high trained 
in the use of chemicals that can be used in the production of 
armaments." [passage omitted] 
  In July 1992 a Government inquiry into Thor Chemicals ended 
dramatically amid allegations that workers at the Cato Ridge 
factory were deliberately poisoned by unknown saboteurs who 
"spiked" breathing equipment with a massive dose of mercury. 
Desmond Cowley, chairman of Thor's parent company, Thor 
Holdings (UK), linked the poisioning to "a long list of events 
which we know were sabotage, including the brutal murder of 
Kidger." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Chris Louw] </F>
  [Text] African National Congress secretary general Cyril 
Ramaphosa this week made his first move to assert his influence 
on government from outside the cabinet, when he announced major 
structural changes in the organisation. 
  During a heated ANC caucus meeting on Tuesday [21 June] 
morning, Ramaphosa's position was strengthened when he was 
elected chairman of a committee to investigate the relationship 
between the cabinet and parliament. Caucus members accused 
President Nelson Mandela's government of taking decisions 
unilaterally and insisted that MPs have greater access to the 
parliamentary processes. 
  Ramaphosa recently refused a cabinet position. Senior 
members of the National Party [NP] expressed their concern at 
the time, arguing that he was planning to frustrate the 
government of national unity by influencing decisions through 
the ANC caucus. 
  According to reports, Ramaphosa was smarting because Thabo 
Mbeki was made deputy president instead of him. Apparently 
offered the portfolio of foreign affairs, by Mandela, he refused 
on grounds that he wanted to focus his energy on strengthening 
the ANC organizationally. He was later elected chairman of the 
Constitutional Assembly. 
  The latest developments were watched with concern this week 
by NP members. They fear that all cabinet decisions may in 
future be subjected to ANC caucus approval, rendering them 
powerless. 
  This, they maintain, will be "contrary to the spirit of 
national unity and nation-building". 
  It was agreed between the ANC and the NP during negotiations 
last year that the new government would function on the basis of 
"power-sharing". If the balance of power is to shift to the ANC 
caucus, the NP will be powerless. 
  The ANC caucus showed its muscle on Tuesday when it decided 
that a cabinet committee looking into the issue of a new capital 
for the country be disbanded. The four-man committee was 
appointed by Mandela and is led by Constitutional Development 
Minister Roelf Meyer. 
  The caucus insisted that a more representative committee be 
appointed, arguing that most members of the present committee 
were biased towards the Transvaal. 
  Objections were also raised to the "untransparent" way the 
cabinet was functioning. MPs wanted the cabinet to seek the 
advice of caucus on policy issues and before any decisions were 
taken. Caucus chairman Mendi Msimanng released an angry 
statement after the meeting, demanding that a new committee 
investigate the location of the capital. 
  ANC MP Raymond Suttner was reported as saying the people 
should be drawn into the decision-making process. "We don't 
want a parliament which is little more than a passive receiver 
of cabinet decisions." 
  Ramaphosa called a media conference for Thursday afternoon 
to 
announce restructuring measures taken to improve the ANC 
organizationally. Details were not known at the time of going 
to press.

<F P=106> [Report by Anne-Marie Mischke] </F>
  [Text] Tension between the ANC parliamentary caucus and 
party leaders in the cabinet could just be the thing that makes 
Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa to say to himself: "I chose well when I 
decided to serve the party rather than to sit in the cabinet." 
  He has been appointed chairman of a committee which has to 
look into relationships between the cabinet, parliamentary 
members, and ordinary ANC members. Amid tension between the 
caucus and the cabinet, he is being regarded by certain caucus 
members as the right man to be their leader. 
  Caucus members this week clearly expressed their discontent 
about cabinet decisions made without consultation with them. 
The days of "Yes Minister, No Minister, OK Minister" are gone, 
one member told RAPPORT. 
  The cause of discontent this week was the fact that only a 
small cabinet committee of four members has been appointed to 
investigate the position of Cape Town and Pretoria as 
parliamentary capitals. The caucus demands that a fully-fledged 
parliamentary committee should investigate the matter. 
  Two weeks ago individual caucus members reacted angrily to 
the cabinet's decision not to declare 16 June, Soweto Day, a 
public holiday. 
  RAPPORT has already earlier reported on discontent within 
the 
caucus because of appointments made by President Mandela against 
the will of the caucus. There was also a grouse over President 
Mandela's failure to attend the first caucus meetings. Ever 
since, say ANC members, he has only attended one caucus meeting. 
  Caucus members are also disgruntled that they were not 
informed that the cabinet had appointed Mr. Trevor Manuel as 
leader of the National Assembly. They maintain not only that 
they should have given some input regarding the appointment, but 
also that they should at least have been informed. 
  The ANC culture that leaders cannot make decisions on their 
own has a long history. Since the organization was unbanned 
four years ago, it has been insisted on that people at ground 
level must be consulted on important decisions. The ANC caucus 
is determined to continue with this culture.

  [Text] There are serious rumors that the ANC and the NP 
[National Party] intend to become one party at a later stage. 
  Perhaps it is only a section of the NP that thinks along 
those lines, or a section of the ANC. Nonetheless, such a 
development is still politically significant. It focuses 
attention on the NP's total opportunism. 
  Firstly, the NP turned its back on the right wing, and then 
adopted the old program of the United Party. But that was not 
leftist enough. It then went on to hijack the political 
platform of the Democratic Party, to a point where there was 
virtually no difference between the NP and the DP. Through the 
referendum, the NP completely swallowed up the DP. It would 
then only be in keeping with the trend if the NP united with the 
ANC. There are no differences in principles between the two 
parties. The difference lies only in color. The ANC is a party 
for blacks and Indians, while the NP is a white-led Colored 
party. 
  There is another reason to lead one to suspect that there 
could be something in the rumor. This is in keeping with plans 
for the left-wing's "new South Africa," concocted since 1973 by 
the ANC and the money powers. The primary objective had been 
the destruction of the Afrikaner's political power. To succeed 
in keeping it powerless, and to prevent any existence of an 
opposition, the new structures have to be made as inclusive as 
possible; not only the new multiracial state, but by implication 
also its governing party. 
  The next logical step will then be to promote an NP/ANC 
coalition, which will eventually lead to the country becoming a 
one-party state.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  WEEKEND STAR </H8>
  Limits of Tolerance -- "It is time to stop talking of `dirty 
tricks'" as it implies "low-scale misbehavior, peccadillos" or 
"at worst, paper burglaries of the Watergate kind. Murder is not 
a `dirty trick'" to be "shrugged off or glossed aside," notes an 
editorial in Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English on 25-26 June 
on page 8. "Now that an inquest court has judicially implicated 
the Civil Co-operation Bureau in the murder of SWAPO [South-West 
African People's Organization] advocate Anton Lubowski after 
five years of rumor, suspicion, slow disclosure and considerable 
hush-up, justice needs to proceed with dispatch and 
determination to an end result." While the "era behind us 
involved a psychosis of war" and "wrongs were done on both 
sides," however "a moral line must be drawn, and the moral line 
can never encompass cold murder." It is necessary to learn who 
committed what crimes "and where the chain of command stopped. 
The Lubowski suspects should be extradited to Namibia. 
Internally the truth commission should become a priority, 
unopposed by anyone with a clear conscience." 
<H8>  SUNDAY TIMES </H8>
  Disclosure -- "A note of desperation has crept into the 
attempts of Mr F. W. de Klerk's government to prevent disclosure 
of criminal actions committed in defense of apartheid." The 
"common feature" of the Windhoek inquest into the Lubowski case, 
the Goniwe inquest, the David Webster case and others "is that 
neither judicial inquiries, nor inquests, nor prosecutions 
succeeded in penetrating the web of deceit woven by the 
Nationalists," states an editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES 
in English on 23 June on page 28. "All these inquiries seem to 
peter out just below the level that would implicate either the 
top officers of the security services, or the politicians who 
guided them. The glue that holds the conspiracy together is 
secret amnesty and secret indemnification, in terms of laws 
crafted by the de Klerk government." "We know that our present 
government includes killers and torturers, and people who sent 
them to kill and torture." "To fix responsibility for crimes or 
atrocities committed in the past, whether in defense of 
apartheid or in the struggle against it, does more than identify 
the guilty: it also exonerates the innocent." 
<H8>  THE CITIZEN </H8>
  Robin Hood Budget -- "It is called the Robin Hood budget, 
Minister of Finance Derek Keys taking from the rich to give to 
the poor," states an editorial in the Johannesburg THE CITIZEN 
in English on 23 June on pages 1 and 2. "However the 5 percent 
transition levy on taxpayers and companies earning more than 
R50,000 [rand] is hardly confined to the rich." The "levy aside, 
Mr Keys produced a somewhat bland budget." He did not remove or 
increase the VAT [value-added tax], "imposed modest increases in 
excise duty on cigrettes, wines, spirits and beer," "cut the 
corporate tax from 40 percent to 35 pewrcent, but raised the 
secondary tax from 15 percent to 25 percent." "This was to our 
minds a sleight-of-hand budget, socking the middle amd 
upper-income taxpayers and giving little to the poor directly in 
pension and other social benefits." "In essence, what his Budget 
has given is fair warning that the redistribution of wealth has 
begun." 
  Their Role -- While the "hand of the ANC" can be seen in 
some 
of the budget decisions, "the government as a whole has to take 
the blame," for "there is joint Cabinet responsibility for all 
decisions taken by the government and all actions by the 
ministers, whatever their portfolios," notes an editorial in 
Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English also on 23 June on page 6. 
With the "overwhelming" ANC "majority of votes and seats in the 
Cabinet, it will increasingly have its way on issues that put it 
into power like the Reconstruction and Development Programme and 
the redistribution of wealth and land. How the National Party 
[NP], as a junior partner in government, handles this situation 
remains to be seen. It can either become a comfortable ally of 
the ANC or a vigorous opposition party in Parliament and outside 
it." IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Buthelezi "has an even 
more difficult task" since "he continues to be under attack from 
the ANC." "As there is no opposition of any consequence in 
Parliament, it is left "to the NP and IFP to be standard bearers 
of opposition politics. Will they, especially the NP, do so? The 
political future of these parties and of the opposition will 
depend on the answers." 
<H8>  RAPPORT </H8>
  Red Recipe -- "Red lights are starting to flicker," notes a 
page-22 editorial in Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 26 
June as it criticizes the appointment of Ronnie Kasrils as 
deputy minister of defense. "The appointment of Ronnie Kasrils, 
a communist activist of the highest degree as deputy defense 
minister, does not only give an indication of the ANC's 
`security course,' but is symptomatic of how the South African 
Communist Party [SACP] is quietly getting its hand on important 
levers of power." Another communist, Mr. Sydney Mufamadi, is 
already minister of safety and security, the former police 
portfolio. The Red recipe is clear for everyone to see: "Get 
control of a country's security apparatus firstly, and work 
further from there on." "The exact same strategy was adopted in 
the former Czechoslovakia, in Poland, in Bulgaria and many 
others." Defense Minister Joe Modise said about the appointment 
of Mr. Kasrils that the ANC has been very generous, as it is 
capable of running the country on its own, but prefers not to do 
it. Mr. Mandela has also referred to Mr. Kasrils as his 
favorite. "Indeed a meaningful remark, to say the least." 
Shortly after his appointment, Mr. Kasrils rejected the nine 
generals' disapproval of the proposed Truth commission as 
"irrelevant," and added that there had always been an "openness" 
in the ANC/SACP freedom struggle. The editorial goes on to call 
Mr. Kasrils a "shadowy figure" who "played a dubious role in the 
Bisho massacre," and concludes by asking: "What has he and his 
party, and by implication the ANC, up their sleeves? And which 
further Red strategy is quietly being devised at the SACP 
headquarters?"

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  ANC Internal Rivalry -- The editorial in Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 27 June on page 8 begins by stating 
that the recent restructuring of the ANC shows that "the 
phenomenon of parliamentary versus extra-parliamentary 
politics...will continue long into the future." The editorial 
suggests that "the development of `people's power' outside the 
Parliament...strengthens the hand of ANC secretary-general Cyril 
Ramaphosa in the contest for ANC leadership" once Nelson Mandela 
resigns. While, noting that the extra-parliamentary forces have 
opportunities "to restrain government excesses," the paper warns 
against efforts "to advance shortsighted, populist causes by, 
say, opposing attempts to impose fiscal discipline or liberalise 
the economy." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  East Rand Violence -- "We urge the PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regional government of Tokyo Sexwale 
to make East Rand townships a top priority in the unfolding of 
the Reconstruction and Development Plan [RDP]." So says an 
editorial on page 12 of Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 27 
June. The editorial charges that the causes of violence in East 
Rand townships are the badly deteriorated infrastructure and 
high unemployment. To combat the problem, the paper urges 
"haste in ensuring that ordinary people begin to see tangible 
results of the RDP." "Upgrading of Reef townships," the paper 
argues, should take priority over projects such as refurbishing 
the Johannesburg City Hall. 
<H8>  BEELD </H8>
  President's Example "Worthy of Emulation" -- "The days are 
obviously past when the ANC pampered rebellious youngsters who 
refused to go to school," says an editorial on page 6 of the 
Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 20 June. "Hence President 
Mandela's blunt words last week to the youth on the anniversary 
of the 16 June uprising: Roll up your sleeves, forget about 
protest, and tackle the country's problems in a culture of 
education and reconciliation. The message is not new. The 
difference is that this time it comes from a democratically 
elected president whose government has to deal with the enormous 
problems arising from the disruption of schools in the townships 
in recent years.... President Mandela emphasized his concern 
over the youth by adding that he will forfeit one-third of his 
salary to a fund to help street children, and children in 
detention, and poor children who wish to study. It is an 
example worthy of emulation by his political colleagues, the 
youth, teachers, and parents." 
  Concern Over Truth Commission `Not Unfounded' -- The 
Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 21 June says in a page-10 
editorial: "The concern of the Commissioner of Police Services 
over the damaging consequences of a Commission of Truth on 
certain ANC members in government will be taken with a pinch of 
salt in some circles....But his opposition to such a commission 
could possibly have more to do with the reasonably general fear 
in the inner circles of the old regime -- in political and 
security circles -- that only the sins of apartheid will be 
exposed, and that they alone will have to pay the price. If 
that is what the commissioner fears, he should say so outright. 
His fears are apparently not totally unfounded. By spelling 
out his opposition to the commission honestly, he will achieve 
more and hopefully ensure that the commission exposes the whole 
truth and, more important, achieves genuine reconciliation. The 
commission will only succeed in its aim if it is seen to be fair 
and just towards all parties, and if it probes in all directions 
impartially. If that is what the police chief is aiming at, 
then he ought to be given support." 
  Child Health and Care -- A second editorial on page 10 of 
the 
same issue of BEELD says: "It is disturbing that South Africa 
has fallen so far behind in the provision of health and other 
care to its children....According to the UN Children's Fund, 16 
African countries have attained a better standard of living for 
their children than South Africa, the continent's most 
prosperous country. Part of the solution lies in the provision 
of more and better health services, particularly among the 
neglected part of the population." But this, together with "the 
provision of specialized treatment where necessary," is not the 
whole solution. "To improve the living standards of the 
children, it is further necessary to persuade parents that 
smaller families are in everyone's interests.... The legitimacy 
of the new government offers it a golden opportunity to tackle 
this sensitive issue."

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Chris Simpson in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] The United Nations special representative, Alioune 
Blondin Beye, has been busy shuttling around southern Africa. 
He has just returned to Luanda from South Africa where he had 
talks with President Mandela. After consultations with 
President dos Santos he is heading back to Lusaka. In spite of 
the snail pace negotiations and the fierceness of the fighting, 
Mr. Beye is apparently not a man to despair. From Luanda, Chris 
Simpson reports. 
  Alioune Blondin Beye reiterated once again that he was still 
optimistic about the prospects of peace in Angola and that the 
Lusaka talks are still moving toward a settlement. He 
acknowledged that Angolans in cities like Kuito and Malanje were 
in a terrible predicament and that the current phase of fighting 
was the worst for months, but he refused to succumb to 
pessimism. Mr. Beye is meeting President Jose Eduardo dos 
Santos this evening and confirmed he will be returning to Lusaka 
tomorrow, which may rule out another meeting with UNITA leader 
Jonas Savimbi in Huambo. 
  Mr. Beye stressed that it was a top priority to get UN aid 
flights back on track, but so far, it has not been possible, 
with UNITA yet to give its approval. The head of the UN World 
Food Program in Angola, Philippe Borel, warned today that cities 
like Malanje cut off for more than a month were likely to slide 
back to the state they were in several months ago, with hundreds 
of people dying. It is a tragedy, he said. 
  There is no hint of any let-up in the fighting inside 
Angola, 
with Angolan National Radio again reporting fierce clashes in 
Kuito, with 30 deaths today.

<F P=106> [Interview with UN representative Alioune Blondin Beye by </F>
unidentified correspondent in Luanda on 24 June--recorded] 
  [Text] President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos 
today received Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of 
the UN secretary general in Angola and mediator at the peace 
talks in Lusaka. He also received the Brazilian Ambassador to 
Portugal. 
  The audience granted to Alioune Blondin Beye lasted about 40 
minutes. Beye arrived in Luanda today from South Africa where 
he received assurances of the personal engagement of President 
Nelson Mandela in the peace process. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent] I would like to know if 
the 
Angolan peace talks will be transferred from Lusaka to any South 
African city. 
  [Beye] It is true that I was in Cape Town yesterday to meet 
with President Mandela. It was, therefore, normal for me to 
come to Luanda today to meet the president of the Republic. Our 
meeting obviously centered on the peace process. 
  [Correspondent] We should not think that the peace talks 
will 
be transferred to South Africa, given the readiness expressed by 
President Mandela? 
  [Beye] As you are aware, I have on several occasions visited 
heads of state of countries neighboring Angola. The visit to 
President Mandela, the president of a democratic South Africa, 
is therefore normal. He can certainly contribute toward the 
peace process. 
  [Correspondent] What will happen after 30 June, that is, 
after the meeting of the UN Security Council? 
  [Beye] At present it is difficult to give a reply, because, 
the UN Security Council is examining the situation in Angola and 
as an international official, I cannot speak about a decision 
that the UN Security Council has yet to take. I can say, 
however, that the international community is concerned with the 
Angolan problem and it will not remain indifferent. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Beye, the war is intensifying in Angola 
at a gigantic pace, while peace talks in Lusaka are moving at a 
chameleon's pace. Is it possible to speak of deadlines in the 
peace talks? 
  [Beye] That is true, but there was a worse situation in 
August and September last year. Despite that, we began talks in 
Lusaka and we have made progress. Last week Dr. Savimbi told me 
that 90 percent of the work has been done. All the same, it is 
also true that in the past days or weeks, the military situation 
has deteriorated and this does not help the peace talks and the 
humanitarian action. 
  [Correspondent] A last question, Mr. Beye. Only 10 percent 
of the work remains to establish peace in Angola. Can we then 
say that peace is a fait accompli, that the 10 percent will not 
make the war continue? 
  [Beye] I am convinced that we can bring peace to Angola 
because the Angolan people want peace. The role of the press is 
to make the Angolan people believe in peace and in that way 
peace will be irreversible. I know that we are facing very 
difficult periods but I known that there will be light at the 
end of the tunnel. [end recording] 
  Alioune Blondin Beye is also expected to meet with Angolan 
Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura. He leaves for Lusaka 
tomorrow.

  [Excerpt] Joao Lourenco, secretary of the Popular Movement 
for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA], has said there was a 
positive development in Lusaka. He was referring to the 
conclusion of discussions on housing. Joao Lourenco said, 
however, that we cannot expect the peace talks to conclude 
anytime soon. Regarding mediators and observers who approached 
South African President Nelson Mandela for assistance, Joao 
Lourenco said all this can be summed in one sentence: Things 
are complicated in Lusaka. 
  [Begin Lourenco recording] I interpret the decision to 
approach South African President Nelson Mandela for assistance 
as a sign that things in Lusaka are complicated. Things are 
complicated. Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative 
of the UN secretary general in Angola, feels that talks are 
dragging on. An agreement should have been reached long ago. 
  Before being sworn in as the president of South Africa, Dr. 
Nelson Mandela expressed interest in assisting the Angolan 
people in the best way possible. I believe it was on the basis 
of that interest that Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye approached 
President Mandela in order to help reach a successful conclusion 
of the Angolan peace talks as soon as possible. [end recording] 
  Nelson Mandela is a well-known figure worldwide, and South 
Africa is a regional power. Joao Lourenco said these two 
factors can help to pressure Jonas Savimbi to lay down arms. 
President Nelson Mandela agreed to cooperate. He will not come 
in with new diplomatic initiatives. He will only reinforce the 
ongoing process. The ruling party is happy with Nelson Mandela's 
readiness. His readiness was welcomed by the MPLA. 
  [Begin Lourenco recording] We welcomed his readiness to 
assist. We think -- we have always said this -- every form of 
assistance, every step that can truly contribute to the Angolan 
people finding a lasting peace as soon as possible is welcome. 
[end recording] 
  Speaking about the Lusaka peace talks, Joao Lourenco said 
that at present there is a positive sign. He said there is no 
information about the accord at the present, however. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent John Mukhela in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] Even as the fighting in Angola has intensified, the 
talks between the government and UNITA [National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola] rebels in Lusaka have continued or 
some might say have dragged on. Once again there were reports 
yesterday of an important agreement at the talks but once again 
it seems to have been a mirage. From Lusaka, John Mukhela 
telexed this report. 
  According to the UNITA delegation leader, Jorge Valentim, no 
factual agreement has in fact been reached between his team of 
negotiators and their Angolan Government counterparts, who are 
led by General Francisco Eugenio. Mr. Valentim told me this 
afternoon that under discussion was what is known as point 16 of 
the negotiations. He said that under point 16, demands had been 
tabled by UNITA to the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation 
of Angola] government, urging it to give UNITA presidential and 
office accommodation for its top leadership. Mr. Valentim said 
the deliberations on point 16 have been taking place for the 
last two weeks. Tentative agreement on point 16 was reached, 
however, only yesterday. He said, however, that the government 
delegation has not been categorical on whether or not it could 
go along with the UNITA demands. 
  As of now, the government delegation said it would consider 
the UNITA proposals on the understanding that only a total of 
124 offices and houses would be handed over by the government to 
the UNITA officials. Of these 124 offices and houses, Mr. 
Valentim said two-thirds were situated right in the Angolan 
capital, Luanda. He said that this was not a happy outcome and 
that the current offer fell far short of what UNITA required. 
It did not match UNITA's status and responsibilities, he said. 
The need for office and residential accommodation was an 
important part of the negotiation process because the government 
had nationalized all UNITA-held property in 1975 when it 
originally came to power. Valentim added: Our leaders need 
proper facilities and they cannot continue indefinitely to 
operate from hotel rooms.

  [Text] Military activities by Jonas Savimbi's men continue 
in the country. In Kuito the calm registered yesterday morning 
and afternoon was interrupted at dawn today with intense 
shellings by the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA]. By midmorning today, more than 200 shells had 
been fired against the city. More than 30 people have been 
killed by these shellings over the past 24 hours. Our 
correspondent Abel Abraao reports. 
  The people are still unable to come out in the streets in 
search of water, food, and firewood for their livelihood. 
Famine, just like the war, continues to kill people in Kuito. 
According to hospital sources, over the past 48 hours three 
children, five old people, and one pregnant women, totalling 
nine people, died of hunger at the hospital. The lack of 
medicines is also another problem facing the local people [words 
indistinct] by snipers determined to kill anyone trying to cross 
the street.

  [Text] The capital of Cuanza Norte is now calm following 
clashes over the past few days. The government forces expelled 
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] 
soldiers from the outskirts of the city to a radius of about 70 
km. During the follow up operations, 400 Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola [FALA] soldiers were killed and others fled 
in disarray. Our correspondent reports from the area: 
  The UNITA rebels are dispersed, that is why they stopped 
shelling the city with long range weapons. The Angolan Armed 
Forces, National Police, and civilian defense are successfully 
conducting the follow up operations with the aim of widening the 
defense cordon for a radius of action over 30 km of the city so 
that the population may search for food in secure conditions.

  [Text] The city of Choa, capital of Cabinda Province, two 
days ago was attacked by the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] armed forces within the framework 
of defensive operations under way in the area. Americo Chivala, 
Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel correspondent in the 
area, says that during 23 June's attack at least 23 Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola soldiers were killed and 
several others wounded. The clashes lasted about 30 minutes and 
were dominated by rocket and mortar attacks. For a month now, 
the troops of the Luanda communist regime have been involved in 
an offensive against areas under the control of UNITA, which has 
already claimed the lives of hundreds of innocent civilians. 
The Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola are carrying out 
defensive operations to protect the civilian population in 
Cabinda.

  [Text] The situation in the city of Kuito has changed from 
critical to tragic. In the military field, there has not been a 
significant alteration over the past 24 hours. Jonas Savimbi's 
soldiers are still shelling the city, the civilians are still 
dying as a result of war and hunger, and people have not been 
buried in the graveyards for a long time. Our correspondent 
reports from the area: 
  [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] The city has 
once again been violently shaken by B-30 and other guns of 
various calibers belonging to the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] rebels. Although the shelling is 
less intense than in the first days of the clashes, between 
yesterday and today more than 10 civilians were killed and 18 
others seriously wounded. Reliable sources of the Angolan Armed 
Forces [FAA] Operation Command yesterday told our newsdesk that 
UNITA rebels are once again preparing to take over the city of 
Kuito. Second Commander Lucume, however, has said the FAA is 
following closely the Black Cockerel's actions so as to respond 
adequately should such an attempt take place. So many people 
have been killed in Kuito that there is almost no place to bury 
the dead. For instance, one of the warehouses that served as a 
cemetery over the past few days has no more place for graves. 
The city of Kuito is facing a tragic situation, with residents 
being killed by war and famine. [end recording] 
  On the battlefront, the government forces are still 
inflicting heavy losses on Black Cockerel soldiers. A source 
from the FAA General Staff says that government forces have 
retaken Mupa and Cuvelai in Cunene Province, and Zela commune in 
Bengo Province. Meanwhile, JORNAL DE ANGOLA quotes the same 
source as saying that in Malanje Province, UNITA guerrillas are 
laying mines over roads leading to farms, particularly on the 
Quessua Road of the city of Malanje. 
  About 700 guerrillas of N'Zita Tiago's Front for the 
Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave-Armed Forces of Cabinda, and 
the Renewed Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave of 
(Jose Pimbursio) surrendered to government authorities in 
Cabinda Province. This was revealed yesterday by Cabinda 
Provincial Governor Augusto da Silva Tomas. Tomas said the 
armed operations carried out by N'Zita Tiago's armed faction in 
the north of Cabinda will not affect the current process for 
future talks on the Cabinda conflict.

  [Text] Jonas Savimbi's National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] has finally launched its attack 
against the defenseless residents of Kunje Commune after 
deploying a large number of men and war materiel around it. The 
rebel attack, which is supported by intense heavy artillery 
fire, began at about 0500 today and has continued unabated. 
Fire is so intense that clouds of smoke and flames can be seen 
from the city of Kuito, suggesting that houses are on fire. 
Clashes are in progress right now. Shots fired by light [words 
indistinct] weapons can be heard very close to the city. There 
are no reports about the outcome of the ongoing clashes.

that the issue of an eventual government of national unity has 
not been definitely put aside. The head of state said what is 
important is that the government to be formed after the October 
elections should be able to maintain stability, peace, and 
correct operation, so that it can build a better future for the 
Mozambican people. President Joaquim Chissano said this in 
Maputo yesterday at a concert on the occasion of the 19th

  [Text] The leader of the opposition Zimbabwe Unity 
Movement, Mr. Edgar Tekere, has proposed the establishment of an 
army to counter possible attacks by the governing ZANU-PF 
[Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front] party in the 
run-up to the country's general elections. 
  Mr. Tekere called on all able-bodied Zimbabweans, 
irrespective of their political affiliation, to form what he 
called an Angels With Swords army to retaliate to any attacks by 
President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF party. He suggested that 
members should be armed with axes, spears, arrows, and firearms, 
but not bombs. Mr. Tekere's call came only days after two other 
opposition parties had told their supporters to arm themselves 
with spears and arrows in case of attacks by ZANU-PF youths. 
  President Mugabe has already sounded a warning that his 
supporters have more and even better weapons that their rivals.

ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African Cease-Fire Monitoring 
Group] force is reported to have been attacked by the Mandingo 
faction of Alhaji Koromah in Brewerville, Montserrado County. 
According to reports, the attack by ULIMO on ECOMOG broke out 
when ECOMOG tried to prevent Koromah's Mandingo fighters from 
killing civilians whom they accused of being members of the 
Krahn tribe, their major rival. ECOMOG soldiers told newsmen 
that they had to fire back at the Mandingo fighters in 
self-defense, and eyewitnesses said Koromah's faction suffered 
heavy casualties. Scores of civilians are reported to have been 
massacred in the clashes. 
  Meanwhile, the Liberian State Council says those responsible 
for the massacre in Virginia and Brewerville areas will be 
brought to justice.

  [Text] Johannesburg June 24 SAPA -- Price stability is the 
overall social and economic strategy of President Nelson 
Mandela's new government, Finance Deputy Minister Alec Erwin 
said Friday [24 June] in Johannesburg. 
  "We're not just grandstanding for international investors 
and 
the IMF (International Monetary Fund). Stable prices are 
fundamental to this government achieving its objectives," he 
told the SA Chamber of Business budget seminar. 
  Inflation would erode the government's Reconstruction and 
Development Programme and impinge more heavily on the people it 
was targetted at, the poor. 
  In addition, industrial restructuring, to improve future 
economic growth, could only be successful in a regime of stable 
prices. "We all know key industries will have to restructure. 
It's not just because we're a member of GATT (the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) but because the economy is just 
not going to grow," he said. 
  He believed the budget presented on Wednesday by Finance 
Minister Derek Keys had illustrated the government's commitment 
to fiscal discipline and a non-inflationary environment. 
  In re-ordering government's spending priorities, the 
government had succeeded in restraining the overall expenditure 
level. "It would have been a fatal mistake to increase our 
expenditure. It's much easier to increase your expenditure to 
meet your objectives. It's a lot more difficult to re-organise 
your current expenditure... But we're not going to spend our way 
out of restructuring." 
  Mr Erwin urged business to now take the lead in boosting 
investment within the disciplined fiscal framework. "If we wait 
for government to do nicer and nicer things, the economy will 
stagnate," he said. You (business) can influence government 
decisions by taking your own decisions. This country is going 
to have to grow and you have to take the lead."

<F P=106> [Report by Reg Rumney] </F>
  [Text] The money in the Budget for job creation 
demonstrates once again the difficulty of spending money 
allocated for certain socially desirable purposes -- and the 
spending constraints faced by Finance Minister Derek Keys and 
his team. 
  R292-million [rand] is allocated for job creation, outside 
of 
any further money for this purpose that might come from the 
Reconstruction and Development Programme's [RDP] R2.5-billion 
fund for this fiscal year. But around R247-million of that is 
rolled over from the last fiscal year, with only R45-million 
being added to the allocation. 
  In general, while the RDP fund gathers steam, non-RDP 
spending in fields where apartheid left big backlogs is 
restrained. 
  Spending on health dropped two percent in real terms at 
R14-billion, although the shift in spending is seen in the rise 
in the primary health care portion to 25 percent of the total 
health care budget at the expense of secondary and tertiary 
health care. 
  Spending on social security and welfare rose 20.5 percent to 
R13,015-billion, yet this translates, according to the South 
African Council for the Aged, to a disappointing R13 a month 
increase in social pensions. 
  Spending on housing is up 15.6 percent above the amount 
voted 
for 1993/94, but at R2.2-billion falls far short of some 
estimates of the kind of money needed to attack the housing 
backlog. Again, the money will have to come from the RDP. 
  To be fair, spending on social services has to be looked at 
over a longer period to get perspective. Spending on 
protection, which includes defence, has declined as a percentage 
of total spending from 21.8 percent in the 1990/91 budget to 
18.1 percent in the 1994/95 budget. 
  Over the same period social spending has risen from 41.3 
percent to 45.0 percent, or 19.1 percent a year to make up 14.3 
percent of gross domestic product. 
  Within social spending education has risen to 22.0 percent 
of 
the Budget, from an already high 20.9 percent -- education 
spending represents seven percent of gross domestic product for 
this fiscal year. Spending by most departments was cut back to 
find the R2.5-billion for the RDP. 
  But transition costs associated with security during the 
election negated any "post-apartheid dividend". The disastrous 
National Peace-Keeping Force exercise alone swallowed up 
R384.5-million. 
  While the defence budget was cut by R650-million, transition 
costs push it up again this fiscal year. So spending on 
protection services actually rises by R2,309-billion, or 10 
percent, slightly above inflation. Within that defence 
spending, widely seen as a source of money for diversion to 
social spending, rose by 13.5 percent. 
  And the South African National Defence Force has released a 
document arguing that the defence budget will have to increase 
in future, and cutbacks have harmed defence capabilities.

  [Text] Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special representative in 
Angola, and the troika of observers have just returned from 
South Africa where they met with President Nelson Mandela. The 
South African leader is willing to help resolve the Angolan 
dispute by peaceful means. 
  Beye is about to leave for Luanda to meet President of the 
Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos, probably this afternoon. Beye 
will go to Huambo tomorrow to meet Jonas Savimbi, leader of the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. 
  A UN Angola Verification Mission source told Radio Nacional 
de Angola a while ago that for the time being there will be no 
summit as was reported. There will be consultations, either in 
Angola or South Africa. 
  Government and UNITA negotiators did not meet this morning. 
They could meet this afternoon to begin discussing the 
application of national reconciliation modalities. These 
include the integration of Jonas Savimbi into Angola's political 
life.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Dias Mahachi in Tete] </F>
  [Text] Afonso Dhlakama's soldiers confined in Sinjale 
assembly area, Mutarara District, Tete Province have barricaded 
the Cambulatsitse-Mutarara road since yesterday demanding food. 
Two vehicles belonging to World Vision International carrying 
seeds and agricultural implements have been held hostages by the 
soldiers as a way of forcing the UN Operations in Mozambique 
[Unomoz] to solve the logistical problems in the center. 
  Antonio Mafutabanda, Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] 
delegate in Tete Province, says that the Sinjale assembly area 
has more than 500 soldiers and was opened on 13 June. On the 
occasion, Unomoz officials pledged to supply to the soldiers 
food and there was none. Unomoz officials in the city of Tete 
told our reporters that a food delivery for the center had been 
planned for 27 June. The Renamo delegate in Tete Province says 
this is contrary to what was agreed upon on 13 June. Meanwhile, 
the blue helmets stationed in Tete to maintain peace, a Renamo 
delegate, and a Renamo adviser to the provincial governor left 
for the Sinjale assembly area this morning to solve the food 
problem the Renamo soldiers face. A Unomoz logistical official 
stated that the Renamo soldiers in Sinjale will receive their 
food ration today. In Tete Province there are two other 
assembly areas for Renamo soldiers, one in Chioco, Changara 
District, and Muchena, Macanga District.

  [Text] Ndjamena, 23 Jun (AFP) -- Chadian President Idriss 
Deby has appointed Noudjalbaye Ngaryana as minister of public 
health to replace Dr. Salomon Ngarbaye Tombalbaye who 
"categorically refused" to enter the government formed on 17 May. 
  Mr. Noudjalbaye Ngaryana, a police commissioner, is a close 
relative of former President Francois Tombalbaye. The post of 
health minister has remained vacant since the decision made by 
the son of the first Chadian head of state, Ngarta Tombalbaye, 
not to be part of "a government that will only increase the 
sufferings of the Chadian people," according to his own 
statement. 
  Meanwhile, Abderamane Dadi, former managing director of the 
National School of Magistrates and Administration, has also been 
appointed secretary general of the government to replace Dono 
Horngar Neldita. The replacement of the government secretary 
general follows the arrest on 18 June of Prime Minister Delwa 
Kassire Koumakoye by the Higher Transitional Council [CST] for 
"anomalies" in the 1994 budget. Some members of the CST, the 
transitional Chadian parliament, had called for the dismissal of 
Dono Horngar, who they charged with "tampering" with the text.

<F P=106> [Report by Michel Cariou] </F>
  [Excerpts] Gikongoro, Rwanda, June 27 (AFP) -- French 
paratroopers Monday [27 June] entered the southwestern town of 
Gikongoro, 100 kilometers (60 miles) inside Rwanda, on a 
reconnaissance mission as five people were killed when a shell 
landed on a Kigali church. 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe meanwhile said that 
France's military intervention in Rwanda, dubbed Operation 
Turquoise, had attained its first objective by restoring 
security to threatened people. 
  More than 200,000 Hutus fleeing the rebel Rwandan Patriotic 
Front (RPF) have found refuge in the Gikongoro region, according 
to local authorities. The town is only 20 kilometers (12 miles) 
from the frontline between the Rwandan Armed Forces and the 
rebel movement. 
  A military spokesman said the 12-man patrol arrived in two 
vehicles amid outbursts of joy from townspeople. It would 
return to the Rwandan-Zairian border later Monday. [passage 
omitted] 
  About 1,200 French crack troops and 300 vehicles were 
deployed on the Zairian-Rwandan border early Monday, or roughly 
half of the troops that are to take part in Operation Turquoise 
before the end of the week, commander General Jean-Claude 
Lafourcade said. 
  In Paris, assistant chief of staff General Raymond Germanos 
said that French troop strength between the two staging posts of 
Goma and Bukavu, in Zaire on the Rwandan border, was being 
progressively expanded to its full strength of 2,500, and would 
reach 1,300 by Monday evening compared with 1,150 Sunday. 
  No incidents had been reported, but the troops had noted 
tensions when they made forays into western Rwanda. "People are 
frightened and don't always show it," Germanos said, "The 
atmosphere is very tense." The town of Kibuye on the shores of 
Lake Kivu was the main seat of inter-ethnic tension between 
Tutsis and members of the majority Hutu tribe, another military 
source said. The source said several hundred Tutsis had taken 
refuge around the town under the protection of nuns and were 
being threatened by Hutu extremists. 
  In the Rwandan capital Kigali five people were killed and 
several others injured when a shell landed on the Sainte Famille 
church. The church and the surrounding area, in a 
government-controlled district of the capital, is home to some 
8,000 largely Tutsi people, the UN mission to Rwanda said. 
  Conditions in the complex are deteriorating and the UN has 
been unable to evacuate anybody for over a week, to the despair 
of the refugees who are now not receiving any aid. 
  About 800 Tutsis are inside the building, remaining there 
round the clock for fear of being killed by the Hutu militia who 
guard the complex and who are said to be responsible for several 
massacres since the conflict erupted in April. 
  Guinea-Bissau said Monday it was willing to send backup 
troops to assist the French military mission in Rwanda and was 
studying the matter with French officials. 
  Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross 
succeeded in evacuating 45 wounded Rwandans from Kigali's 
overcrowded hospital as the capital experienced a lull in the 
fighting. The evacuation was thwarted on Sunday when Tutsi 
rebels pounded Hutu government positions in central Kigali, 
where the hospital is located. 
  In a related development the French daily LE MONDE reported 
Monday that a missing flight recorder from a plane crash that 
sparked the bloody civil war in Rwanda had turned up in Paris. 
  The "black box" is in the hands of former gendarmerie 
captain 
Paul Barril, a member of a disgraced anti-terrorist unit that 
once worked for French President Francois Mitterrand. 
  The box went missing after the April 6 crash of Rwandan 
president Juvenal Habyarimana's Falcon 50 at Kigali airport, 
shot down in a suspected rocket attack. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with UNAMIR commander General Romeo Dallaire by </F>
correspondent Alain Frilet in Kigali on 24 June 94: "In Kigali, 
`The Rwandan Patriotic Front Has Become a Little More Nervous'"] 
  [Text] The arrival of the first French contingents in 
Rwanda within the framework of "Operation Turquoise" has led to 
a large number of disruptions in the daily work of the Blue 
Helmets belonging to UNAMIR (the UN Assistance Mission in 
Rwanda). At the head of the UNAMIR since he arrived in Kigali 
in October 1993, Canadian General Romeo Dallaire today expressed 
his fears and doubts and gave a brief appraisal while awaiting 
the reinforcements promised by UN headquarters in New York. 
  [Frilet] What have been the consequences of French 
intervention in Rwanda for the UNAMIR forces? 
  [Dallaire] None so far, except that the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front (RPF) has become a little more nervous and is trying to 
ascertain the impact that this intervention might have on its 
own situation. As a result, it has reviewed its relations with 
us and affirmed that it can no longer guarantee the safety of 
the UNAMIR elements whose countries of origin announced that 
they would contribute troops to the French initiative. That is 
why I have withdrawn all the Senegalese, Congolese, and Togolese 
military observers. Apart from that, the RPF has also affirmed 
that since the announcement of French intervention, they would 
no longer be able to guarantee the security of Kigali airport, 
which is why we have so far been unable to reopen it. 
  [Frilet] Just recently, you would appear to have interrupted 
quite a number of your observation missions in the capital. Is 
this a direct consequence of "Operation Turquoise"? 
  [Dallaire] We have run up a delay over the past few days 
because of the departure of the African contingents, and because 
the new team designated to replace them has still not arrived. 
Moreover, the delay in replenishing the logistics supplies of my 
own force is also delaying and slowing down our operations. 
Nonetheless, we are still carrying out our reconnaissance 
missions in the capital and shall continue to distribute food. 
  [Frilet] Since Friday, you have set up a permanent telephone 
link with the French commander in Zaire. What kind of relations 
are you going to maintain with him? 
  [Dallaire] Let us rather say that I have his telephone 
number. More seriously, my objective is to establish some form 
of cooperation and coordination with the French commander in 
accordance with the orders I have received from UN headquarters 
in New York so that the two groups of staff can meet. This 
meeting should take place within the next few days. We will 
then discuss what we are thinking of doing, on both sides, and 
see how we can best adapt to these new circumstances. On my 
side there is not a great deal of adaptation to do. As soon as 
I have the men and equipment, I shall continue to fulfill my 
mission here in Kigali, and as far as I know the French should 
be staying in the western part of the country. 
  [Frilet] Why has the arrival of the 5,500 men who are meant 
to reinforce your own troops in Kigali been delayed? 
  [Dallaire] Perhaps Rwanda is regarded as a difficult country 
when it comes to making commitments. The mission that we are 
accomplishing is itself difficult, and we have still not secured 
a cease-fire.

  [Text] French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said this 
morning that the rebels' opposition to French intervention is 
dying down. Monique Mas has just spoken to Major Emmanuel 
Ndahiro, military spokesman of the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic 
Front], and asked him if the RPF has softened its stand: 
  [Begin Ndahiro recording, in English fading into French 
translation] Not at all. We have not changed our position 
toward the French intervention. Considering past French 
actions, we are still opposing it. They were responsible for 
the killings in Rwanda and we have no reason whatsoever to trust 
them. As you know, they have never helped solve our problems. 
We could not prevent them from coming here. What RPF leaders 
say is that if the French limit their intervention to the 
Zairean border and to humanitarian actions we will not clash 
with them. We issue a warning to the French: History has taught 
us that they have not come to rescue 8,000 people, but to 
protect the criminals who have murdered more than 500,000 
people. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] One of the unintended side effects of last week's 
French intervention in Rwanda has been to allow journalists more 
freedom to report on what is going on in the west of the 
country, which is largely under the control of the interim 
government. In the past, journalists who ventured into the area 
have complained of harassment by militias who were widely 
believed to have been trained by the government during the rule 
of President Habyarimana. Rwanda's ambassador to Uganda, Claver 
Kanyarushoki, is in close contact with the interim government. 
In Kampala, Mwambu Wanendeya asked him how they see the French 
intervention. 
  [Begin recording] [Kanyarushoki] The French Government has 
had a long cooperation history with Rwanda in many fields 
including the security [word indistinct], so it is true that 
France had cooperation with Rwanda, and among the fields of 
cooperation were the military and gendarmerie and so on. 
  [Wanendeya] But these allegations that they trained these 
militias who people perceive as being responsible for most of 
the massacres. Is there any truth in that? 
  [Kanyarushoki] I do not believe so. Definitely, they train 
the Army, parts of the Army like the Belgians were doing, like 
the Germans were doing with the gendarmerie, so they trained the 
regular Army, there is no doubt about it, but for the militias, 
I do not think they did unless there is any hard evidence, but I 
will doubt very much that they did ever train the militias 
outside the regular Army. 
  [Wanendeya] Do you think the media coverage of this war has 
been biased in favor of the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]? 
  [Kanyarushoki] Yes, definitely. 
  [Wanendeya] And why do you think this? 
  [Kanyarushoki] I do not know. Perhaps, there might be so 
many reasons including the ground work done by the RPF itself, 
by their public relations, and by their own propaganda. I do 
not know, really. There might be some other reasons, but I 
think those are the ones, which is the fact that they do have a 
good network of public relations and good contacts in the media 
and so on. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, refugees sheltering in a church in the Rwandan 
capital have once again come under artillery fire. The 8,000 
people in Sainte Famille have been waiting for weeks in the hope 
of being rescued by UN Forces. UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in 
Rwanda] has been trying to ferry people across the battle lines 
during the sporadic lulls in the fighting between interim 
government forces and the RPF rebels. On the line to Kigali, 
Raggi Omar asked Serge Arnauld of the French News Agency if the 
church had been badly damaged in the attack. 
  [Begin Arnauld recording] Yeah, it did not hit the church 
itself. It was close to the church, but as there are so many 
refugees -- UNAMIR estimates that there are around 8,000 -- five 
of them have been killed this morning. 
  [Omar] Have you managed to get down to the Sainte Famille 
Church yourself? 
  [Arnauld] Yeah, a few journalists could go there with the 
UN, 
but we came after the shelling so we only saw the impact of the 
mortar shell. We did not see the bodies of the wounded. 
  [Omar] What was the situation at the Sainte Famille Church 
once you were able to get there? 
  [Arnauld] The situation is horrible. I mean there are 
thousands of refugees in the church, which is dark and 
(?stinks). It is really terrible. They are all asking to take 
them out. Now, the UN is... [pauses] It is already 10 days that 
they have not done... [pauses] They cannot do anything for 
these refugees, so the situation of these refugees is worsening 
and worsening. 
  [Omar] Is there any idea as to who might have been 
responsible for the mortar bomb or is that impossible to tell? 
  [Arnauld] There is an idea. It should be the rebel forces 
because they are shelling in this direction. The church is 
located in an area of the government troops who normally could 
be... [pauses] It should be the rebel forces who fired the 
shell. 
  [Omar] Has this been the only incident of its kind today? 
  [Arnauld] It was the only incident of its kind today. The 
fighting was not as strong as yesterday--only sporadic shelling, 
so it was the only incident we know. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Jean Helene on assignment in Kabale, Uganda: </F>
"Where Are the Weapons for Rwanda Coming From?"] 
  [Text] UN officials seem unable to end the arms trafficking 
that makes possible the massacres.... 
  Kabale--"To my knowledge, no weapons have been sent from 
Uganda to Rwanda since the deployment of the UN Assistance 
Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] in August 1993," declares Bangladeshi 
Colonel Asnar, military head of UNAMIR. He adds: "We have 
monitoring posts on all the roads leading to Rwanda, and our 
foot patrols put up mobile roadblocks. Also, ground operations 
are supported by helicopters providing aerial surveillance." 
  Are 80 observers really enough to watch over 170 km of 
border 
winding through hills, forests, and swamps? In private, UN 
officials readily admit the border cannot be hermetically sealed 
with such a small contingent, however well equipped. Moreover, 
UN observers run up against perplexing snags from time to time. 
For example, the fact that sometimes they must wait for days 
before getting approval from Ugandan forces, the National 
Resistance Army (NRA), to inspect a new zone; Colonel Asnar 
blandly calls them "procedural delays." 
  In 1993, UNAMIR personnel had to wait for two weeks for 
permission to monitor the environs of the Kakitumba border post, 
across which all provisions for the Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF] 
allegedly passed on their way into Rwanda (according to rumors 
never confirmed), and until 16 June humanitarian convoys were 
not allowed to use the asphalt road leading down from Kakitumba, 
though it is the most direct route for getting emergency aid to 
the RPF zone. These questions remain unanswered, and one has the 
impression that neither the RPF nor Ugandan authorities are 
being completely candid. 
  Of course, President Museveni tells anyone willing to listen 
that it is no difficult feat to transport arms clandestinely in 
that region. He can (and does) testify eloquently on that score 
from his own experience: When he was chief of a small rebel band 
in central Uganda, in the early 1980's, his men traveled to 
Bujumbura to pick up Libyan arms at the Islamic Cultural Center 
there, bringing them back by truck across Rwanda and Milton 
Obote's Uganda and presenting false documents at every 
checkpoint describing the cargo as Burundian tea! 
<H5>  Clandestine Networks </H5>
  To diplomats posted in Kampala, it seems clear the Ugandan 
Army could seal the border "with 20 men per kilometer" if only 
the political will existed. While some observers concede that 
arms may also be coming in over the Zairian border, Uganda 
appears in reality to be the sole conduit through which supplies 
are reaching the rebels, the lifeline of the RPF, and the means 
by which the latter easily circumvents the embargo decreed by 
the UN Security Council. 
  The provenance of the arms also raises a number of 
questions. 
It is difficult to account, for example, for all the movements 
of the Nigerian airplane that was held up several days in Cyprus 
after a stopover in Israel last month and ultimately landed at 
Entebbe. But it is possible some of the arms, destined for 
rebels in south Sudan, were diverted to resupply the RPF. 
  In the Ugandan capital, debate continues over the extent to 
which Yoweri Museveni is implicated in Uganda's support for the 
RPF, a support that seems only logical given the large number of 
Rwandan exiles who joined Museveni's guerrillas and helped him 
take power in January 1986. Those who discount his involvement 
put most of the blame on members of his entourage (both in the 
military and in government political circles) who collaborate 
closely, unbeknownst to the president, with RPF leaders, either 
because they are ethnically Tutsi or Hima (Museveni's ethnic 
group, the Ugandan tribe closest to the Tutsi), or because of 
the help they received during their own guerrilla years. No one 
here doubts the Rwandan rebels, when they launched their first 
attacks in northern Rwanda (in October 1990), were equipped with 
Ugandan military materiel, but was it slipped covertly to them 
or openly proffered? 
  UN officials at Kabale believe arms were transferred 
continously (i.e., in a series of deliveries) from Uganda to 
Rwanda between October 1990 and August 1993, when UNAMIR was 
deployed. Presumably, the RPF is profiting handsomely from the 
downsizing of the NRA, which is demobilizing nearly one-third of 
its 90,000 soldiers at the "suggestion" of the World Bank. The 
downsizing has freed up a considerable amount of "surplus" 
equipment, and some demobilized soldiers might be tempted to 
join the Rwandan rebels. 
  Another source of provisions: supplies captured from the 
enemy, especially munitions stores and heavy weapons of French 
origin seen in rebel convoys headed for the front. The RPF has 
built up a substantial "war chest" of funds collected from a 
Rwandan diaspora that is very supportive of "the cause," i.e., 
the return to Rwanda. Finally, it is even possible the rebels 
are receiving support from the predominantly Tutsi Burundian 
Army, which turns a blind eye to quasi-overt RPF recruiting 
efforts among Rwandans and Burundians in the refugee camps. Such 
support, though understandable, makes it possible for the RPF to 
persevere in its offensive. "The RPF's clandestine arms network 
has been in place a long time," says one Rwandan diplomat, 
"while we ourselves must rush around to find new suppliers. Our 
normal suppliers, like South Africa, have been told to respect 
the embargo." 
  Is Uganda's at least tacit support for the RPF intended to 
repay the debt Mr. Museveni owes the Rwandan refugees? Or is he 
attempting, as the interim Rwandan government claims, to "create 
a Tutsi empire in the region"? "The president has other 
concerns," explains one Western diplomat, "beginning with the 
south Sudan problem." 
  The imminent arrival of Sudanese Army units on Uganda's 
northern border--up to now in the hands of south Sudan rebels 
backed by Kampala--may well accelerate destabilization of the 
north at the hands of Khartoum, which already is arming a small 
group of guerrillas there who are little more than bandits. 
Uganda's president is reportedly eager to "dispose" of the 
Rwandan exiles by sending them back home. "Back in 1988, I told 
Habyarimana (the Rwandan president killed on 6 April, whose 
death triggered resumption of the civil war) that he should let 
the refugees go back," says Mr. Museveni, probably worried lest 
the opposition capitalize politically on anti-Rwandan 
xenophobia. In fact, Rwandan refugees (the first of whom arrived 
in 1959) have done quite well for themselves in Uganda and have 
often served as scapegoats, notably in 1982 when they were 
literally expelled by then-President Obote to Rwanda, which 
adamantly refused to accept them. The "Banyarwandans" then gave 
their support to Mr. Museveni, who launched his rebellion. But 
after the NRA captured Kampala, anti-Tutsi feeling exacerbated 
the emergence of a veritable "Rwandan mafia" that Ugandans have 
sorely resented. 
  Ever since the start of the conflict, Yoweri Museveni has 
said the Tutsi insurgency was an internal Rwandan problem, and 
he rarely used to criticize the RPF; but recently he has changed 
his tune. Following the massacre of the bishops in Kabgayi, with 
the Ugandan press reporting survivors' accounts of killings 
attributed to the RPF, Museveni has been harshly critical of the 
rebels. 
  The Ugandan head of state seems now to be distancing himself 
from them, and calls publicly on the RPF to accept a cease-fire, 
since "it lacks the means to win the war rapidly." He also 
insists on the need for changes in the current government, as 
envisioned in the Arusha accords and to remove those responsible 
for the massacres. It is said that Mr. Museveni left the OAU 
summit in Tunis in some haste, irritated as he was by criticism 
from his peers over his support for the rebels at a time when he 
was making an all-out effort to help, meeting on a regular basis 
in Kampala with a "crisis committee" composed of the ambassadors 
of neighboring countries and U.S., French, and British 
representatives. 
  While it is obvious in Kampala that UNAMIR enjoys cordial 
relations with the RPF, the same cannot be said for the 
humanitarian organizations clamoring to get into the rebel zone. 
The RPF wants to maintain tight control over the organization of 
emergency assistance to the "600,000 displaced persons in camps 
in the liberated zone," and humanitarian organizations are 
raising a hue and cry about these constraints. 
  Other problems have also surfaced, such as the temporary ban 
on access to some camps, which is still controlled jointly by 
two officials, one political and the other military. For 
"security reasons," it is difficult or impossible to leave these 
camps, where observers have raised questions about "educational 
meetings" which rightly or wrongly, are being described as 
"reminiscent of Cambodia."

  [Excerpt] Paul Barril is back in a tale worthy of science 
fiction: The former National Gendarmerie Intervention Unit 
commander and former star of the Vincennes Irish saga claims to 
be in possession of the black box from the plane in which the 
presidents of Rwanda and Burundi were killed on 6 April. Eric 
Jung has just contacted Captain Barril, who accuses the rebels 
of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] of having carried out this 
attack: 
  [Begin recording] [Barril] I have not only the black box, 
but 
also various other items which go with it. I have three reels 
from the control tower, I have all the recordings, all the 
telexes, all the airport's books, which I went to the spot to 
find myself. No doubt you are going to ask me why, but I will 
tell you that I have been a specialist in the fight against 
terrorism, and that was an attack on two heads of state, which 
also killed three Frenchmen, and this attack was planned by a 
terrorist group backed by a pseudoterrorist state which is also 
responsible for the genocide of the 500,000 Rwandans who have 
died in recent times. 
  [Jung] Here you are referring to the RPF, Paul Barril. 
  [Barril] Yes, absolutely, and I will give you a piece of 
information that is of capital importance to me and to those who 
are listening to us: In an attack like that, with two heads of 
state and three Frenchmen killed, no proceedings, no inquiry, at 
a national level or at an international level, has been launched 
by anyone, and this is a flaw in the system of justice, because 
there is no international system of justice, and the matter has 
not been referred to France, and during the next few days we are 
going to lodge several complaints at an international level to 
attempt to rattle a little those who planned this attack. Those 
who planned it and executed it are responsible for the massacre 
of 500,000 innocent people which followed. These are the people 
who must be tried, and I have done everything I could: I have 
been to the spot, I have been helped by people, I have collated 
eyewitness accounts, to point the finger at these people and 
bring them to trial so that they can be tried by an 
international commission. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Hatred broke out in Rwanda and atrocious 
massacres took place because of an attack on the plane carrying 
the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi in Kigali on 6 April. 
[passage omitted] 
  A former officer [Captain Barril] is reported to have got 
hold of the black box in Kigali, where he went at the request of 
the family, who have found refuge in France, so that he could 
start all inquiries he deemed useful to find the truth about the 
attack: 
  [Begin recording] [Mrs. Habyarimana, Rwandan president's 
widow] You know, inquiries have been started, but I can tell you 
that people said straight away that the RPF [Rwanda Patriotic 
Front] was behind the attack but, since I left the country 
without knowing what people were saying, I can guarantee that 
the Rwandan army did not shoot at the president because the 
Rwandan army did not have any missiles. [end processing] 
[passage omitted] 
  The Dassault-Aviation company has just issued a 
clarification 
that goes against Captain Barril's revelations: According to 
Dassault-Aviation, there was no black box on the former Rwandan 
president's plane, a Falcon-50.

  [Text] Sao Tome, 24 Jun (AFP) -- The political crisis 
between Sao Tomean President Miguel Trovoada and the government 
of Norberto Costa Alegre worsened today with a call by the 
opposition parties asking the head of state to sack the prime 
minister and hold early legislative elections. This request, a 
copy of which AFP received, also asked the head of state to 
appoint international experts to look into the management of 
public finances over the past three years and to bar government 
members from leaving the country for as long as this inquiry 
will last. 
  Yesterday, in a communique the government accused President 
Trovoada and the opposition parties of "causing political 
instability in the country" by trying "to convince the people 
that the government had misused the national budget." "The 
government is responsible for managing budget resources and it 
is answerable in this regard to the National Assembly alone," 
the communique added. Up until now, the government had never 
openly involved itself in this fray, leaving it to the majority 
party, the Democratic Convergence Party [PCD]. 
  This deterioration in relations between the two poles of 
power has continued despite a series of meetings held early this 
week between President Trovoada and the leaders of the various 
political parties, from both the majority and the opposition. 
  The labor unions have in turn entered the fray by calling 
for 
a three-day general strike starting early July, to protest "the 
economic degradation of the country, the misuse of the social 
security budget, and the refusal of the government to negotiate 
with workers' representatives." The government has asked 
workers not to heed this strike call, which was launched by the 
country's largest labor federation, the National Sao Tome and 
Principe Workers Organization. 
  The PCD won the first multiparty legislative elections in 
1991, defeating the former single party -- the Movement for the 
Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe-Social Democratic Party -- 
which now constitutes the main opposition party. The following 
year, Trovoada, contesting as an independent candidate, won the 
presidential election. The mandate of the present National 
Assembly will expire at the beginning of 1995.

  [Text] The head of the Zairian Government, who was recently 
appointed by the High Council of the Republic-Transitional 
Parliament [HCR-PT], has just written to Frederic 
Kibassa-Maliba, chairman of the Sacred Union of the Radical 
Opposition [USOR], asking him to propose to him names of 
opposition members for the formation of the next government. 
HCR and radical opposition member Christian Badibangi is 
unhappy about this gesture, and he spoke to Jean-Claude Medome. 
  [Begin recording] [Badibangi] It is just a gesture for the 
outside world. It is a way of justifying the overture, as Mr. 
Kengo Wa Dondo seems to be saying. However, for USOR, we know 
that Kengo Wa Dondo's election is entirely illegal. USOR and 
Allies have already taken the stand of telling the whole 
national and international community that any existing or 
supposedly existing government does not concern the opposition 
especially as the government or the prime minister must be 
presented by a group other than the one belonging to the head of 
state. 
  [Medome] Some Zairians could nonetheless accuse you of going 
rather too far. Do you not think that it is about time you 
collaborated with Kengo Wa Dondo to enable Zaire to get down to 
work? 
  [Badibangi] We want to establish the rule of law and 
judicial 
security in our country. We must ensure the security of 
everybody. Even the holding of future elections will depend on 
this. 
  [Medome] Why not accept this overture from Prime Minister 
Kengo Wa Dondo, that is, to form a government and prepare the 
elections together? 
  [Badibangi] Indeed, the problem seems simple when it is 
presented at the tail end. To believe that we simply have to 
allow him to form his government with the radical opposition 
without knowing the actual motive of Kengo Wa Dondo, who it 
would seem has assumed the premiership through a personal and 
unilateral move, and to commit the entire radical opposition in 
this manner, I think, is to take the wrong tack. 
  [Medome] What do you have to say to those who feel that USOR 
is promoting the interests of one man, Etienne Tshisekedi, to 
the detriment of the nation's supreme interest? 
  [Badibangi] No, I do not think that's true; we believe that 
there is a popular will. We believe that our people decided 
[words indistinct] of the Republic by the National Sovereign 
Conference and that this prime minister-elect has not been able 
to carry out his functions. Why this injustice especially as he 
has not been able to exercise the mandate entrusted to him by 
the people for two years. That is the reality. [end recording]

  [Text] Low turnout characterized early morning voting in 
almost all the polling stations in Kakamega's [western Kenya] 
three constituencies, where by-elections are taking place today. 
  An early morning survey by KTN in Lurambi, Ikolomani, and 
Shinyalu constituencies revealed that all the polling stations 
opened at 0600. By 1000 very few stations had registered more 
than 20 voters. The three constituencies have between 20,000 to 
30,000 registered voters. Throughout the constituencies, people 
went about their normal activities as if they were not aware of 
the by-elections taking place. However, KTN noted some 
encouraging turnouts in a few polling stations, particularly in 
Ikolomani constituency followed by a few polling stations in 
Kakamega town which is largely in Lurambi constituency. Most of 
the voters seen were women and youth who came trickling in small 
groups or singly. 
  KANU [Kenyan African National Union] and FORD [Forum for the 
Restoration of Democracy]-Kenya officials who had been on an 
early morning roundup of the polling stations in the three 
constituencies told KTN that they were satisfied with the 
polling arrangements except for a few anomalies which they had 
detected in some polling stations. In Kakamega town's 
industrial area, the town's mayor, (Morgan Magaga), alleged that 
FORD-Kenya youth were intimidating voters, asking them to vote 
for their party.

spokesman said personalities who signed the Nairobi peace accord 
on 24 March 1994 and other accords and who called themselves

to divide the Somali people. 
  The spokesman appealed to the Somali people to be on their 
guard against those causing friction aimed at bringing problems 
similar to those of the past. The spokesman said the alliance 
was opposed to the war which was being waged people against 
peace. He said the SNA was not ready to wage war against 
anybody, and appealed to its supporters to desist from taking 
Somali people's lives and committing robbery. The SNA spokesman 
concluded by saying that peace-loving Somalis should unite and 
counter those opposed to peace and coexistence.

  [Text] The Council of State has saluted and applauded 
General Johnson for taking the bold step of inviting ECOMOG 
[Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring 
Group] to take over all areas under his control. The council 
said in its opinion this will not only enhance the peace process 
but will also bring the conflict nearer to the desired solution. 
The council also views this action as a step in support of the 
disarmament process as prescribed by the Cotonou Accord. 
  The Council of State issued the statement yesterday when it 
announced that Major General Roosevelt Johnson of ULIMO [United 
Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] had invited ECOMOG 
to take over all areas under his control. The statement of the 
turnover was made by Gen. Johnson last Thursday [23 June] when 
he presented copies of his letter sent to the field commander of 
ECOMOG and the UNOMIL [UN Observer Mission in Liberia]. The 
council is urging other leaders of warring factions to emulate 
this exemplary gesture by Gen. Johnson, an important development 
for which the Liberian people have been waiting. 
  Meanwhile, the council is calling on ECOMOG to put in place 
all the necessary mechanisms for a smooth transition to enhance 
its peacekeeping efforts. In a related development, the State 
Council says it will shortly appoint superintendents and other 
officials of government to move into these areas to establish 
civil administration.

  [Excerpt] The minister of finance, Wilson K. Tarpeh, has 
been suspended with immediate effect by the chairman of the 
Council of State for his failure to provide weekly financial 
report to the council on the fiscal performance of government. 
  Announcing the suspension Friday [24 June] at the Finance 
Ministry, where he had gone for a brief visit, the chairman of 
the council, His Excelllency David Kpomakpor, observed that for 
the past three months, Mr. Tarpeh has failed to provide the 
council with such report following the [word indistinct] request 
to do so. According to a press release quoting the council, 
Minister Tarpeh shall remain suspended until he has submitted a 
detailed financial report to the council covering the period 
from 7 March to 24 June this year. 
  Meanwhile, Mr. (Josiah Gbon), deputy minister of 
administration at the Ministry of Finance, has been appointed as 
acting minister of finance, with immediate effect. Mr. (Gbon) 
has been instructed by Chairman Kpomakpor to conduct the fiscal 
affairs of the nation until otherwise advised. 
  Prior to his suspension, Mr. Tarpeh briefed Chairman 
Kpomakpor that 22 international financial institutions have 
accepted to convene a donor conference in Liberia during which 
Liberia will have the opportunity to make (?her case) on why she 
continues to remain in arrears of indebtedness to the 
international financial institutions. Mr. Tarpeh noted that 
Liberia has been placed on a critical list which will allow the 
country to benefit from financial aid in the areas of 
electricity and water supply. The suspended finance boss also 
informed Chairman Kpomakpor that paychecks for the month of May 
had been ready for disbursement next week. The council recently 
suspended LPC's [Liberian Peace Council] nominated [word 
indistinct] minister on the job, to allow for an audit into the 
financial operations of that corporation.

  [Text] Members of the Constitutional Conference have been 
asked to evolve a system of government that would guarantee a 
stable society and accommodate all shades of opinion without 
oppressing or marginalizing any section or group. Inaugurating 
the body in Abuja today, the head of state, General Sani Abacha, 
explained that the virtues and disadvantages of both 
parliamentary and presidential systems of government. [sentence 
as heard] He also asked the conference to devise a system of 
checking elected representatives to ensure that participation of 
citizens was beyond mere casting of their ballots. 
  Gen. Abacha also called on the members not to regard their 
appointment as another exercise of constitution making. He said 
the problems facing the country were beyond mere acts of 
constitution making. He lamented how the country spent most of 
its 34 years of independence in the midst of crises of 
legitimacy, secession, and that of national acceptable 
leadership. 
  The head of state also spoke of the need to strengthen the 
judiciary and ensure open scrutiny of the activities of law 
enforcement agencies to enhance and protect fundamental rights 
of citizens. Gen. Abacha told delegates to be cautious on the 
issue of revenue allocation formula, adding that whatever 
recommendation they may come up with must ensure that revenue 
allocation complement rather than substitute revenue generation. 
  On the terminal date of his administration, Gen. Abacha said 
government would fix such date only after making reference to 
the decisions of the conference. He then gave assurance that 
the conference would not only enjoy total freedom but its 
decisions would also be set aside by the government. [sentence 
as heard]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Delegates to Nigeria's controversial constitutional 
conference have met for their first session in the capital, 
Abuja, this morning. It has gone ahead in spite of months of 
criticism by the opposition who boycotted the elections leading 
up to the conference and say they distrust the intentions of the 
ruling military council, led by General Sani Abacha. From 
Lagos, Sola Odunfa reports. 
  [Begin recording] [Odunfa] Virtually all the delegates 
attended the short opening ceremony in a serene but colorful 
atmosphere. Gen. Abacha's address to the delegates was a review 
of Nigeria's recent political history and arguments for and 
against both the presidential and parliamentary systems of 
government. He urged the conference to find and recommend a 
system which would guarantee the nation's stability by 
accommodating all shades of political opinions and ensuring the 
full participation of all parts of the country. He repeated his 
earlier statements that his government was on what he described 
as a rescue mission and that its life span would be determined 
by the decisions of the conference. 
  While he was speaking in Abuja, the union of petroleum 
workers was issuing an ultimatum in Lagos. Addressing a news 
conference at the headquarters of the Nigerian Labor Congress 
[NLC], the petroleum workers union, Nupeng [National Union of 
Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers], gave the military government 
up to this weekend to restore all democratic political 
structures which were abolished last November and to install the 
winner of the last presidential election believed to be Chief 
Moshood Abiola who is now in detention awaiting trial for 
alleged treason. 
  The union said that if the government did not meet the 
deadline, it would call all its members out on strike from next 
Monday [4 July], thereby paralyzing the petroleum industry, 
including fuel supplies. I asked Mr. Frank Kokori, the union 
secretary, why the petroleum workers were acting in isolation of 
all other 41 unions in the Labor Congress. 
  [Kokori] I am acting on behalf of Nupeng. Nupeng is an 
industrial trade union, so there is no question of isolation. 
Other (?people) could come in sympathy with us. 
  [Odunfa] When you say other progressive unions may join you, 
which are these unions? 
  [Kokori] Well, I will not mention them. Those of you who 
have been following the media reports for some time now, 
you....[pauses] People are talking about 13 unions. People are 
talking about 10 big unions. You go and make your research. 
You will know the big unions I am talking about. 
  [Odunfa] Why do you choose to act alone, why not in concert 
with other unions under the umbrella of the NLC? 
  [Kokori] We are thinking that in situations like these, you 
do not just follow conservatives blindly. In situations like 
these, in revolutions all over the world which you know, there 
must be a vanguard that will galvanize the people. Nupeng today 
remains the only viable vanguard in this country that could 
sustain such a revolution. But I assure you, other progressive 
forces will join henceforth from today. [end recording] 
  To get the Nigerian Government's view of events, Robin White 
called up Alhaji Aminu Saleh, the head of the civil service, in 
Abuja, and he asked him if the constitutional conference had got 
off to a good start. 
  [Begin recording] [Saleh] The conference started very well. 
The attendance was beyond what we expected. The enthusiasm of 
Nigerians to see that some element of democracy is coming up is 
so encouraging to those of us in government and outside 
government. 
  [White] You said the attendance was better than you 
expected. 
What kind of turnout were you expecting? 
  [Saleh] We were expecting that the turnout would be only 
those that were elected and their supporters, family, friends, 
etc, but the generality of people are very anxious and they 
turned up, the turnout was very, very encouraging. 
  [White] Did you see any people there who might be considered 
to be supporters of Chief Abiola? 
  [Saleh] Could we say that this is a matter which is more 
regarded as matters arising. The Nigerians have passed beyond 
this. 
  [White] They have passed beyond Abiola? 
  [Saleh] They have passed beyond Abiola with the start of the 
conference. 
  [White] But you think all Nigerians have forgotten him? 
  [Saleh] Well, there may be one or two supporters, but when 
you are working in a democracy and you have the majority going 
one way, you assume that the majority carries the vote. 
  [White] Could I ask you where Chief Abiola is now? 
  [Saleh] Chief Abiola is in the hands of the police, and he 
is 
well, safe, and he will be brought before court. 
  [White] But where exactly is he? 
  [Saleh] He is within Nigeria. 
  [White] Is he in Lagos, or is he in Abuja? 
  [Saleh] He is within Nigeria in the hands of the police. 
  [White] Why are you not prepared to say exactly where he is? 
  [Saleh] Well, he is in the hands of the police. I am the 
secretary to the government. I would not be able to know the 
movement of every Nigerian. 
  [White] But surely, you must know where he is? 
  [Saleh] I know where he is, and I say he is within the four 
walls of the country. 
  [White] Are you not prepared to say where he is because if 
you did, there might be big demonstrations around the police 
station where he is being held? 
  [Saleh] There will be no demonstrations in Nigeria. As I 
said, Nigerians now go on to another agenda. 
  [White] But, surely, he still has massive support in some 
areas of Nigeria? 
  [Saleh] Of course, yes, he is a son of the soil. Not 
everybody will say no, but definitely, the majority of people 
now want to move forward. 
  [White] Do you yourself believe that this Abacha government 
really intends to hand over to civilian rule? 
  [Saleh] I am part of the government. I am the secretary to 
the government and we say... [pauses] Two days ago, I was 
addressing the press representatives and I say we are going to 
act according to what we say, and that is what we are doing now. 
  [White] I wonder if Gen. Abacha might be a little worried 
about a coup attempt against him? He went round last week 
warning the soldiers. 
  [Saleh] Gen. Abacha is the commander in chief, and it 
implies 
that he has a responsibility not only to the civilian community 
but also to the Armed Forces community, so for him as a 
commander in chief to go and see the people he commands is only 
normal. 
  [White] But why was it necessary to warn them? 
  [Saleh] Well, I do not know what to say about this except to 
say it is the normal regimental [word indistinct] to warn your 
officers and your junior officers to be on the alert and to 
behave in a military way. 
  [White] Do you think anybody might be plotting at this time? 
  [Saleh] I think Nigerians are more concerned with the 
progress of their country, to move forward rather than going 
back. 
  [White] What about junior officers? Do you think some junior 
officers might be brewing something? 
  [Saleh] Well, the junior officers, I believe, are with their 
senior officers and what I know from all information is that 
everybody is only interested to see that things go forward. 
  [White] So you think you are over the hill now, and things 
are going to get back to an even keel? 
  [Saleh] I have been in government before for 35 years. I 
worked with every person who was head of the Nigerian 
government, from Azikiwe to Babangida. I worked with Shonekan 
as minister of finance. When I am talking about governments, I 
know what I am talking about. 
  [White] And you think this government is doing well? 
  [Saleh] The government is doing far beyond what people 
expect, except that they do not talk too much, they work more. 
  [White] How do you rate Abacha compared with the other 
people 
you have worked with in the past? 
  [Saleh] Abacha (?listens) very well, and he is very 
decisive.

  [Text] Inadequate accommodation, transportation, and other 
necessary logistics might delay the commencement of serious 
business at the newly inaugurated constitutional conference. At 
the maiden session yesterday, most delegates complained that the 
shortcomings would seriously affect their attendance. 
  Reacting to the chairman's suggestion that the conference 
should reconvene in (?the morning) today, some delegates said 
they could not make it because of various logistic problems. 
Senator Obo Amon from Delta State said that due to lack of 
accommodation within Abuja most members were residing in nearby 
towns like Katsinaja and Kebbi. Also speaking, Joseph Atibi 
Otodo from Rivers State noted that relevant documents such as 
the decree establishing the constitutional conference, its 
agenda, and the inaugural speech of the head of state, were not 
given to the delegates. Alhaji Musa Inusa from Katsina State 
suggested that the conference should adjourn for a few days to 
give the government chance to put things right. 
  Meanwhile, the chairman of the constitutional conference, 
Justice Karibi-Whyte, has described the head of state's 
inaugural address to the conference as reassuring that the 
military will quit the political stage. Also commenting on the 
speech, the Nkene of Nnewi, Chief Odumegwu Ojukwu, commended the 
Federal Government for setting up a framework within which the 
problems of the country would be solved. Chief Ojukwu, who was 
representing Anambra State, pledged to cooperate with other 
delegates in strengthening the unity of the country.

circulated calling on people to stay at home as from today. In 
a statement, the director of defense information, Brigadier 
General Fred Chijuka, stated that there was no one in the Armed 
Forces called Lieutenant Colonel (Mohamed Obanjuma) said to be 
circulating the posters. He also said that none of the three 
arms of the Armed Forces was harboring any organization calling 
itself Freedom Forces or the Patriotic Faction of the Nigerian 
Armed Forces.

about their normal businesses and to give information that could 
lead to the arrest of the said Lt. Col. (Obanjuma). It said 
anyone found to be circulating the posters should be apprehended 
and handed over to the nearest police station or military 
location.

  [Text] Lagos, 28 Jun (AFP) -- Seven women demonstrators 
were wounded by gunfire and hundreds of people arrested during a 
rally in support of opposition leader Moshood Abiola, the 
committee for the defence of human rights said on Tuesday [28 
June]. The women, many of them small-time traders from the 
Ikeja district of northern Lagos where Abiola lives, were 
holding a demonstration Monday when police intervened, firing in 
their direction and wounding seven, the committee said in a 
statement signed by its national secretary Segun Jegede. There 
was no independent confirmation of the incident. Abiola, a 
millionaire tycoon, was arrested on Thursday after declaring 
himself president, a year after the military annulled 
presidential elections he was widely held to have won.

  [Text] Lagos, 27 Jun (AFP) -- Nigeria's powerful oil and 
gas workers' union on Monday [27 June] threatened to call a 
strike from next week unless the country's military government 
handed over power to Moshood Abiola, the imprisoned 
pro-democracy leader. 
  In a statement, the National Union of Petroleum and Gas 
Workers (Nupeng) said it would call a strike from July 4 if the 
military did not meet its demand. The statement said that the 
military should "quit the political stage now, and permanently." 
"The military should restore all the dismantled 
democratic/political structures that were in place in 1993, and 
call on the acclaimed winner of June 12, 1993 presidential 
election to negotiate a peaceful hand-over of the reins of 
government to satisfy the yearnings of the teeming millions of 
Nigerians who voluntarily gave him that historic mandate." 
  Abiola has been imprisoned since last Thursday after he 
declared he was forming a government to coincide with the 
anniversary of the June 12, 1993 elections which were annulled 
by the military government. He is widely believed to have won 
last year's poll. 
  Nupeng said that if the government failed to meet these 
demands, the union would call a strike "pending the resolution 
of the national crisis in order to avoid a situation which may 
lead to a bloody revolt." 
  The strike threat came as military leader General Sani 
Abacha 
said that a constitutional conference, which opened here Monday, 
would determine the date when the ruling military junta will 
turn over power to civilians. "This administration will not 
`perpetuate' itself in power as insinuated by some people," he 
added. "We are committed to a steady process of democratisation. 
We are ready to surrender power through a peaceful and orderly 
process." But the conference, a cornerstone of the 
administration's blueprint for a return to democratic rule, is 
viewed by the opposition as "a ruse" for the military to 
perpetuate its hold on power.

  [Text] Lagos, 27 Jun (AFP) -- Nigeria's Northern 
Universities Students Association today condemned the arrest of 
leading opposition figure Moshood Abiola and called on "all its 
members and Nigerians to fight for the restoration of democracy" 
in Nigeria, a communique from the association disclosed. The 
Northern Universities Joint Campuses Committee [NUJCC] considers 
Moshood Abiola's arrest as "the biggest blunder of the century 
and evidence of the confusion that has hit the ranks of the 
military junta" in power, according to the communique which was 
passed to AFP. 
  The NUJCC voted "unanimously on a motion of defiance to the 
Constitutional Conference" which was inaugurated today in Abuja 
by Nigerian Head of State General Sani Abacha. For the NUJCC, 
it is obvious that the delegates from the 30 states of the 
federation to this conference "were not elected" because the 
people did not take part in those elections. "How can delegates 
handpicked by the government claim to be representing the 
people?," the association queried in its communique, calling on 
the government to put an end "immediately" to the deliberations 
of the conference. 
  The communique was signed by representatives of the 
Universities of Jos (center), Zaria, Makurdi, Kano, Yola, 
Bauchi, Sokoto, Abuja, Minna, and Maiduguri (north).

  [Text] Freetown, June 27 (AFP) -- Clashes between rival 
groups in an armed Liberian faction left at least 50 people dead 
over the weekend on the Liberia-Sierra Leone border, reports 
said Monday [27 June]. 
  Reports reaching the Sierra Leone capital Freetown said 
hundreds in the Tonkia chiefdom, some 260 kilometres (160 miles) 
southeast of the capital, fled and one witness, named as Tommy 
Fefegula, put the number of dead at around 50. 
  Fefegula said the fighting began between United Liberation 
Movement factions belonging to the rival Mandingo and Krahn 
clans in the two Sierra Leone border villages of Njama and 
Tigbema. 
  He said the Mandingo faction Saturday ordered the civilian 
population to leave their villages in order to teach a lesson 
"once and for all" to Krahn fighters. "They then opened fire 
with heavy guns which resulted in many casualties among the 
combatants," he added. 
  A local chief told AFP by telephone that a Krahn detachment 
had earlier crossed into Liberia to fight the Mandingo faction 
at their base in Kawalahun on Friday evening. 
  Last week, tribal leaders petitioned the military government 
of Captain Valentine Strasser in Sierra Leone "to remove ULIMO 
soldiers from the chiefdom." ULIMO troops have been helping 
Sierra Leone combat its own rebels of the Revolutionary United 
Front in the area for over two years. But villagers have 
complained about the ULIMO presence, accusing them of attacking 
villagers and military posts. 
  The acting chairman of ULIMO's military affairs committee, 
Major General David Bropleh, said Monday the incident over the 
weekend was being investigated. 
  Inter-ethnic violence within ULIMO broke out in the west of 
Liberia four months ago, after the Krahn faction complained that 
Mandingos were given most of the movement's posts in 
transitional institutions set up in Liberia since March 7. 
  ULIMO is one of the three signatories to a peace accord 
signed in 1993 to end the Liberian civil war. The agreement
