"Inflation in China -- Because the Central Government's Policy 
of Slowing Down the Booming Economy Is Not Working in the 
Provinces, Inflation Might Again Reach 20 Percent This Year"] 
  [Text] In the spring of 1992, senior leader Deng Xiaoping, 
when he was on an inspection tour of the booming coastal 
industrial areas, called for accelerated reforms to bring about 
the sustained and rapid development of the national economy. 
Since then, the Chinese economy has kept growing rapidly. Its 
real economic growth rate reached 13.2 percent in 1992, and it 
rose to 13.4 percent in 1993. 
  Among Asia's fastest-growing countries, China especially is 
attracting attention because of its high growth rate and its 
huge market -- 1.2 billion people. There is a spectacular 
inflow of foreign money because after the country vowed to 
create a "socialist market economy," foreign investors have come 
to believe that China will not go back to the old-style 
controlled economy. 
  In 1992, direct investment to China amounted to $58.1 
billion 
on a contract basis. It took only one year to exceed the total 
amount of direct investment registered between 1979 -- the year 
the reform process started with the implementation of the new 
open-door policy -- and 1991. In 1993, direct investment almost 
doubled, to $110.9 billion. On a working basis, it was $23.3 
billion for all of 1979 to 1991, while in 1992 alone it suddenly 
jumped up to $11 billion. It rose to $25.8 billion in 1993. 
These figures show how huge is the inflow of foreign capital 
into China. 
  The IMF has calculated purchasing power parity to evaluate 
China's economy. According to the IMF, China's economy already 
ranks third in the world. If its economic development continues 
to progress smoothly, there is no doubt that China will not only 
become an economic power in Asia but also an international 
economic superpower because of its abundant national resources. 
However, whether we will see the advent of such an era during 
the 21st century is still open to question. When we take a 
close look at China's current economic situation, we realize 
there are so many problems that we can hardly say that China has 
a rose-colored future in store. 
  The most critical issue is the aggravation of inflation. In 
the second half of 1992, there were already concerns about 
economic overheating and the surge of inflation in certain 
areas. Inflation suddenly became rampant in 1993. In 1993, the 
national retail price index climbed 13 percent, more than double 
the 6-percent target set in the national program for economic 
and social development. 
<H5>  There Is No Effective Way To Check the Inflationary Spiral, </H5>
Which Is Caused by Six Primary Factors 
  Over the same period, the workers' living cost index rose at 
a higher rate of 14.7 percent, and actual conditions are said to 
be reflected more accurately in the workers' living cost index 
than in the retail price index because the former includes 
prices for services. Moreover, in 35 major cities, the workers' 
living cost index marked a high increase of 19.6 percent. Fuel 
prices, as well as prices for services, rose 40 percent. During 
the first months of 1994, the workers' living cost index went up 
by 23 percent in 35 major cities. China can no longer leave the 
price level as it is. Things are assuming a dangerous 
complexion, because soaring inflation might lead to another 
round of social disorder, as was demonstrated in the case of the 
1989 Tiananmen Square incident. 
  The inflationary spiral has been brought about by various 
combined factors, of which there are six primary factors: 1) 
The central government has accelerated the process of 
introducing a market economy; it has limited the fields subject 
to price controls; it has promoted price liberalization; and it 
has rapidly extended the fields subject to market adjustments. 
These efforts have caused an increase in prices. 2) 
Overinvestment has helped considerably to escalate the current 
economic overheating and inflation. The growth-oriented 
thinking that considers economic development to be an absolute 
truth has brought about overinvestment and booming real estate 
development in the special economic zones. These circumstances 
have led to a sudden rise in energy prices and in prices of 
construction materials such as steel, wood, and cement. 
  The investment boom was also caused by the fact that local 
governments have gained greater autonomy with regard to 
investment activities. Beijing's policy of devolving central 
powers to local governments has brought forth economic dynamism. 
It has promoted economic development, particularly in the 
coastal industrial areas. The problem, however, is that the 
control system to prevent investment from becoming excessive is 
not working properly. (3) Illegal financing and the illegal 
supply of investment capital have added fresh fuel to 
overinvestment. Financial disorganization, which was evident in 
three areas -- fund raising, interbank lending, and bank 
management -- has come into question. The central government 
has repeatedly issued circulars to restore financial order. (4) 
A supply-demand gap, which is caused by a poor infrastructure, 
and more particularly by a lack of transportation facilities, 
has brought on a sort of bottleneck inflation. (5) Both the 
government and the people are devoted to money worship. Traders 
are actively engaging in speculation. In anticipation of a rise 
in prices, some are forestalling, while others are holding off 
selling. Moreover, some are taking advantage of tax reforms to 
raise prices. 
  (6) In January 1994, China unified the exchange rate of the 
Chinese yuan by introducing a controlled floating exchange rate 
system based on the market's supply and demand situation. 
Because the introduction of a single exchange rate virtually 
corresponds to a substantial devaluation of the Chinese yuan, 
there are concerns about a further rise in import prices. 
  China's growth-oriented thinking has also increased for the 
following reasons. The Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-95) has 
projected an annual growth rate of 6 percent until the end of 
this century. However, in October 1992, the CPC's 14th Congress 
gave a strong show of support for Deng Xiaoping's call for 
accelerated reforms and revised the projected growth rate to 8-9 
percent. This upward revision has caused overinvestment and 
financial disorganization because local governments, which have 
obtained greater autonomy with respect to investment activities, 
have striven for economic development and high growth as a 
natural consequence. 
  The central government is fully aware of the growing 
inflation pressures. At the beginning of 1994, it moved to 
check the inflationary spiral by establishing financial order, 
by promoting financial reforms, and by increasing controls on 
bank loans to be used for fixed-asset investment. In May and 
July 1993, it raised interest rates. Under the apprehension 
that people might lose interest in bank savings, the central 
government has decided to provide, from March 1994, interest 
subsidies through the People's Bank of China to enable banks to 
pay attractive interest rates on fixed deposits. 
  The last time that China's economy overheated was in 1988. 
Compared to that time, the central government is now taking 
prompt measures to meet the situation. However, there is no 
system yet in China to control the economy through a bank-rate 
policy. In 1988, when it adopted a financial retrenchment 
policy, the central government carried out a series of direct 
measures to adjust, through its own efforts, the economy. These 
measures included controls on investment projects and measures 
to hold down spending by government organizations and state-run 
enterprises. As a result, the real economic growth rate dropped 
in 1989 to 4 percent from 11 percent in 1988, while fixed-asset 
investment registered negative growth. 
  Having learned a lesson from its previous experience, the 
central government has projected a lower growth rate of 9 
percent for 1994. However, it is not certain whether the central 
government will be able to impose its policy of slowing down the 
booming economy to bring about sustained and sound development, 
because local governments, particularly in the coastal 
industrial areas, are still eager for rapid development. They 
are said to be strongly opposed to economic reforms that seek 
strengthened macroeconomic control by the central government. 
<H5>  Above All Else, There Is the Possibility of a Revolt by </H5>
Farmers, Who Account for Nearly 80 Percent of the Population 
  If the inflationary spiral cannot be checked, and if China 
continues to take growth-oriented measures, the decline in real 
wages will weigh heavily on people's livelihood. If that is the 
case, it might give rise to social disorder. There are 
indications that the market economy system is already at a 
deadlock. In some areas, panics have already occurred, because 
workers are hastily making sundry purchases to hoard essential 
goods. 
  Meanwhile, according to news reports, workers employed by 
foreign companies are increasingly going on strikes in calls for 
higher wages. This give the impression that the open-door 
policy has also reached a deadlock. If inflation rides high at 
20 percent or more even after the summer season, the central 
government will be forced to carry out direct measures to adjust 
by its own efforts the economy, as it did in 1989. 
  Moreover, if the economic gap between agricultural 
communities and industrializing urban areas becomes wider, 
dissatisfaction will grow among farmers, who are unable to share 
in the benefits of economic development, and there will be no 
holding them back. There is a possibility that the central 
government might become unable to control the drift of 
population from farm villages to cities. China's structural 
distinction between agricultural communities and urban 
communities is indispensable for maintaining the socialist 
system in China. A change in the social structure might even 
undermine the foundation of the Communist Party. 
  Even if inflation is curbed to a certain degree, companies 
with foreign-capital affiliations will see the management 
environment deteriorating, because they will be forced to raise 
workers' wages following the adoption of a single exchange rate, 
and the abolition of the maximum wage system, which was applied 
to foreign companies. Until now, the maximum salary of a Chinese 
worker employed by a foreign company was limited to 120 percent 
of the salary of a similar worker employed by a state-run 
enterprise. 
  The procurement of raw materials and locally made parts will 
become more expensive due to inflation, while the Chinese yuan 
will become hardly obtainable due to a credit squeeze. 
  Taxation reforms will increase the tax burden on foreign 
firms. [China has introduced a value-added tax], but it said it 
will take fiscal steps to offer a rebate over a period of five 
years to foreign firms already operating in China. However, the 
new tax will from this point forward handicap new foreign 
companies coming to China. 
  If we take the per capita economic standard into 
consideration, we have to say that China is still a country on 
its way to development. However, its economic development has a 
great influence on the world economy, because it has a huge 
market composed of 1.2 billion people. China will for quite 
some time grope for a new path to balance the central 
government's macroeconomic control with rising economic activity 
in different parts of the country.

<F P=106> [By Joe Studwell] </F>
  [Text] Over the past 18 months, a procession of Hong Kong 
newspaper proprietors, as well as news controllers from the 
colony's two television stations, have been royally entertained 
in Beijing. Invitations to Hong Kong's media grandees to visit 
the Chinese capital were extended by the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, a unit of the Chinese Government with special 
responsibility for Hong Kong relations. The stated reason for 
the visits was to improve contacts and understanding between the 
Hong Kong media and its future overseers in Beijing. 
  In reality, Beijing's agenda was a little broader. The 
actual host of the visits was not the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office but the Chinese Communist Party's Department of 
Propaganda. The underlying objective was to pursue a policy, 
agreed at the highest party levels, to increase Beijing's 
influence and support among Hong Kong's media proprietors as the 
1997 resumption of Chinese sovereignty approaches. 
  The policy has been discussed since at least 1991, when the 
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and senior Chinese ministers 
reportedly identified increasing China's influence among the 
Hong Kong mass media as a key objective. What has surprised 
observers is the rigor with which the policy has been pursued. 
With the exception of the recalcitrant, pro-democracy owner of 
the financial paper Hong Kong Economic Journal, everyone who is 
anyone in Hong Kong media has been wooed to Beijing for talks 
with leaders from President Jiang Zemin down. 
  At Government House in Hong Kong, China's moves have been 
met 
with consternation and muted outrage. Under Governor Chris 
Patten, the Hong Kong Government itself has been conducting an 
effective media campaign in support of its proposals for greater 
democracy. Local journalists, who were once lucky if they ever 
saw the inside of Government House, are now regularly invited to 
the governor's residence for private briefings. Patten's press 
secretary, Mike Hanson, holds court in reception rooms 
redecorated with soft furnishings and soothing pastel colors. 
It is a slick operation and one, backed by Patten's 
man-of-the-people image, that has produced results. In local 
newspapers not directly funded by Beijing, the Hong Kong 
Government aims to have three column inches of copy sourced from 
itself for every one sourced from China's mouthpiece in Hong 
Kong, the New China News Agency (Xinhua). Under Patten, it has 
not had great difficulty achieving this. 
  China's overtures to Hong Kong's media proprietors have, 
therefore, been all the more galling for the Patten regime. The 
Hong Kong Government sees Beijing, unable to persuade local 
journalists of its case, bringing pressure to bear instead on 
their bosses. But it is no surprise. In the struggle for the 
Hong Kong media, China has tried everything from appeals to 
patriotic sentiment, to economic leverage, to measured amounts 
of bullying. The most potent weapon, of course, is the economic 
one. 
  Most of Hong Kong's media proprietors have been sizing up 
the 
China market; many are already in it. The potential rewards are 
dazzling. If China wants to get Hong Kong's media proprietors 
on its side, the best way is to offer its media market to them. 
This is where the problems begin. 
  Hong Kong has a free press. China does not; nor does its 
government want one. So the dilemma facing media owners who 
cooperate with Beijing is that they cannot predict how much 
leeway they will be given in their mainland media ventures. 
They know the downside of working with Beijing--pressure to 
bring editorial policy in Hong Kong in line with China's views. 
But they don't know the upside--how much money they can make in 
China. The situation has produced much maneuvering among Hong 
Kong's media moguls. As you would expect from people in the 
story business, their tales make an interesting yarn. 
  Of all Hong Kong's newspaper proprietors, probably the most 
important to Beijing is Sally Aw Sian. Her Sing Tao group 
controls the colony's third most popular Chinese paper, Tin Tin 
Daily News, the English language Hong Kong Standard, and the 
company's flagship Chinese language dailies: The morning Sing 
Tao Jih Pao and the evening Sing Tao Wan Pao. Together these 
publications are read by a large slice of middlebrow Hong Kong. 
  Aw is also a world leader in newspaper publishing for 
Chinese 
communities in North America, Australasia, and Europe. Sing Tao 
has an overseas edition that is published in nine cities 
worldwide with a circulation of 160,000. Since Beijing is also 
interested in influencing what overseas Chinese read, Aw is 
doubly significant. "Sally can deliver (the overseas Chinese). 
That is why she is important," says a former Sing Tao executive 
who knows her well. 
  When the Chinese Government began to look at ways of 
getting on good terms with Aw, however, it faced a huge 
obstacle. Not only is Aw an important publisher, she is an 
important Nationalist publisher. At least she was. Sally Aw's 
father, Aw Boon Haw, owned several newspapers in southern China 
and Singapore before 1949 and he and his editorials supported 
Chiang Kai-shek in the civil war. After 1949, when the press in 
Hong Kong split into factions supporting either the communist 
winners in Beijing or the Kuomintang losers in Taiwan, she 
remained a stalwart of the Nationalist cause. When Beijing 
first approached Aw in 1991, her Sing Tao daily still carried 
the old Republic of China date at the top of every edition--the 
standard means of identifying a Kuomintang newspaper. (Taiwan, 
or the Republic of China, dates itself from the fall of the Qing 
dynasty in 1911.) Such historical baggage did not bode well for 
relations between Beijing and Sing Tao. Aw's father was 
classified as a counterrevolutionary by the communists after 
1949 and his property was confiscated. For two reasons, 
however, there proved to be a way forward. The first was that 
Beijing was prepared to pay a high price to have Sally Aw as a 
friend. The second was that Aw wanted into China almost as much 
as China wanted to have her. 
  Sing Tao's room for profitable expansion among overseas 
Chinese communities has largely been used up. But Aw remains 
ambitious. "Sing Tao wants to be the biggest Chinese publisher 
in the world," says Alan Ng, media analyst for S.G. Warburg 
Securities (Far East) Ltd. The only place for the group to go 
is China. 
  Encouraged by Sing Tao's board, Aw responded to Beijing's 
early overtures through a newly recruited executive, Ung Gim 
Sei. Ung is the former general manager of Singapore Press 
Holding's Chinese newspapers division and gained experience in 
China when he was asked by Singapore to develop cultural and 
media contacts with Beijing. Ung put this experience to use by 
beginning negotiations for Sing Tao in 1992. Beijing, 
meanwhile, had already shown that it was serious about doing 
business. 
  In 1991, the Chinese Government decided that Aw's father was 
not in fact a counterrevolutionary but a patriot. He was 
rehabilitated. Property confiscated from him in Shantou, Xiamen, 
Fuzhou, and Guangzhou was offered back to Sally Aw. This was no 
small olive branch, as the case of one of the properties 
illustrates. Aw Boon Haw's large, colonial-style newspaper 
office on the banks of the Pearl River in Guangzhou was taken 
over by the Guangdong Provincial Labor Union after 1949. 
Compensation to get the labor union out, so that Sally Aw can 
have the property back, has cost the Chinese $3 million. 
  By November 1992 the stage was set for Aw's first-ever visit 
to China (she was born in Burma and had not lived in China even 
before 1949). The remaining question was how she would be 
received in Beijing. The reception, as it turned out, was 
extremely positive. As Aw's former colleague, quoted above, 
says: "They gave her a lot of face." 
  Aw traveled to Beijing with her mother, now in her 90s, and 
her elder brother's widow--the three Aw family chieftains known 
in their publishing group as "the three ladies of Sing Tao." 
They were housed in Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, normally 
reserved for senior visitors from foreign governments. They 
were met by Premier Li Peng and General Secretary and President 
Jiang Zemin. In a highly symbolic gesture, Li Peng's wife came 
forward to take Aw's mother by the arm and support her. China 
was showing itself more than willing to forget the past. The 
visit was even publicized on national television. 
  By the time Aw went home she had signed the first licensed 
media joint venture in China. It was for a 50-50 partnership 
with the People's Daily in Beijing in a small leisure magazine 
called Xing Guang (Starlite) Monthly. Two other ventures 
followed during 1993: For a television guide in Guangzhou and a 
financial newspaper in Shenzhen. 
  Back in Hong Kong, it was decided that on April 1, 1993, the 
Republic of China dating should be removed from all editions of 
Sing Tao. In the territory, this did little more than raise 
eyebrows. In the U.S., however, an outcry from Nationalist 
Chinese organizations forced the dating to be restored on two 
editions. 
  Editorial changes in the content of Sing Tao's Hong Kong 
newspapers have occurred more slowly but a year later are not 
difficult to discern. "The changes in Sing Tao (daily) can be 
seen by everybody," says the editor of one independent Hong Kong 
magazine. In the [Hongkong] Standard, the coverage of Governor 
Patten's first policy speech in 1992 is far different from 
coverage of his political reform efforts today. Where once 
Patten was in favor with the paper's editors, he no longer is. 
And when human rights group Asiawatch released a report in 
February detailing China's political imprisonments and 
executions, it was emblazoned on the front pages of the South 
China Morning Post and the Eastern Express. But the Standard 
ignored the report entirely. The Sing Tao group's newspapers 
have moved overtly in Beijing's direction. 
  In China, Ung Gim Sei has been joined by another Singaporean 
to negotiate more media ventures for Sing Tao. Aw's latest 
recruit is James Fu, a man with experience in controlled 
media--he was Lee Kuan Yew's press secretary for 21 years and 
director of the media division of Singapore's Ministry of 
Information and the Arts. 
  Singapore's government, besides maintaining close control 
over the local press, restricts the circulation of foreign 
publications that contradict or criticize it, or refuse it the 
right of unedited reply. Schooled in this media environment, Fu 
is undoubtedly someone that Beijing can trust. As Fu's partner 
Ung points out, when negotiating media ventures with the Chinese 
government: "It depends on how much they trust you." That is 
why, he adds: "We have been selected, in a sense, to do this." 
  The bottom line for Sing Tao in China is still unclear. 
There are many obstacles to be overcome before its ventures can 
be profitable. China limits advertising in newspapers to 25 to 
30 percent of their content (Sing Tao in Hong Kong, by 
comparison, is more than 60 percent advertising) and this 
restricts income. There are also caps on advertising rates, 
though Sing Tao may be able to circumvent these. Editorial 
control, in all Sing Tao China ventures, remains in the hands of 
its Chinese partners, making it difficult to serve the real 
demands of the audience. 
  "Theoretically, the China market has much better long-term 
potential than Hong Kong but it will probably be quite difficult 
to make money in the short term," says S.G. Warburg's Ng. 
Nonetheless, Aw has decided there is money to be made in 
Chinese media, and she is improving relations with Beijing. 
Just where those relations may lead is indicated by the fact 
that the Standard has become the Hong Kong carrier of the 
Chinese Government's English language newspaper, the China 
Daily. Thus, every Monday, Aw publishes the official, 
Beijing-censored utterings of the mainland press. 
  Why she would want to do this is unclear. A senior Sing Tao 
executive offers a clue when he gives his view of life beyond 
1997: "It's definite," he says, "there won't be freedom of the 
press any more." Sing Tao, as a commercial enterprise, is 
pragmatically planning to profit from Hong Kong's reunion with 
China. Says Roddy Yu, the group's associate director of 
marketing: "If we had a choice, we'd ask (Beijing) to let us 
freely distribute Sing Tao in China. That's what we want to 
do." In order to get Sing Tao daily and the group's other 
papers into China, however, Aw first has to make her editorial 
content acceptable. Beijing wins. 
  China's success in finding friends among the Hong Kong media 
reached a peak last October when Malaysian tycoon Robert Kuok, 
an official adviser to Beijing on Hong Kong affairs, bought a 
34.9 percent stake in the South China Morning Post. The Post 
and the Hong Kong Economic Journal are the only two papers in 
Hong Kong to have consistently championed Governor Patten's 
democratic reform proposals. Kuok's takeover of the Post was 
seen as helpful to Beijing's efforts to have a uniformly 
sympathetic Hong Kong media. Kuok, for his part, has denied 
rumors of Beijing involvement in the purchase (fueled by the 
fact that the Bank of China has lent him an unspecified 
proportion of the money). He has also stated that the paper's 
editorial policy will remain unchanged and to date it has. 
  The Post takeover, however, proved to be a complication in 
the struggle for the Hong Kong media. Just when Beijing 
appeared to have its people in place, Ma Ching Kwan (C.K.) 
crashed the party. Ma, chairman of the Oriental Press Group Ltd. 
(OPG), is Hong Kong's biggest newspaper publisher. He had long 
been on China's list of proprietors it wanted to talk to and he 
went to Beijing a couple of weeks before the Post sale was 
announced. 
  Ma must have realized his visit was important when he found 
himself sitting next to a senior official from the New China 
News Agency on the flight to Beijing. Ma refuses to discuss 
what happened in Beijing (it is known he saw Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen and Jiang Zemin) but subsequent events make it clear 
he did not see a profit in backing China. Kuok's purchase of 
the Post caused him to decide there was more money to be earned 
from an independent approach. 
  The stock market was also wary of Kuok's long-term plans for 
the paper. Between Kuok's purchase and mid-December, the Post's 
share price underperformed Hong Kong's Hang Seng index by 29 
percent. "The market," says Charles Whitworth, media analyst at 
Wardley James Capel, "is preoccupied with the fact that Kuok 
owns the Post and nobody believes he is not going to change 
anything." 
  None of this would have interested Ma if the Post were not 
immensely profitable. Kuok's purchase valued the entire paper 
at $1 billion, reflecting the high advertising income that Hong 
Kong's English-language print media enjoy. The Post, with 
circulation around 100,000, had advertising revenues of $78 
million in the first six months of 1993. Ma's Oriental Daily, 
Hong Kong's best-selling newspaper with a circulation of 
600,000, managed just $50 million in the same period. Ma 
already had spare office space and printing capacity available. 
He wanted a piece of the English language action. 
  This was the genesis of Hong Kong's third English-language 
newspaper, the Eastern Express. The paper is not Ma's usual 
style. He is a mass-circulation publisher who speaks limited 
English himself. He took over the Oriental group in 1977 at age 
21, after his father and uncle jumped bail on heroin smuggling 
charges and fled to Taiwan. He rapidly expanded OPG's 
blue-collar market, proving himself an astute businessman. 
Having examined the economic argument in favor of cooperating 
with Beijing, Ma has found it wanting. Eastern Express is a 
better deal. 
  "Essentially, it's a profit-generated decision," says Ma's 
deputy Herman Hui, managing director of OPG. "The English 
newspaper business in Hong Kong is very well remunerated." Hui 
points out that while Robert Kuok paid $349 million for 34.9 
percent of the Post, Ma is putting up only about $3.9 million in 
startup costs for 100 percent of the Eastern Express. 
  Asked about the tactics of Sally Aw's rival Sing Tao group, 
Hui says: "How much is she making in China? The profit margin 
of my papers is much higher than hers. She thinks China is a 
gold mine? I don't know. China will be a gold mine? Maybe. 
I'm not going to give up making a profit here now and keep my 
fingers crossed for a possible profit in the future in China." 
  Hui's economic analysis may bring down the wrath of Beijing: 
"Whatever consequences there may be," he says, "we are prepared 
to face them." The group has made a calculated decision: "C.K. 
Ma feels big enough to stand up to Beijing," says one of the 
owners of a rival Chinese language newspaper. "It would be a 
worldwide scandal if they closed Oriental Daily News." 
  OPG also does not have any interests in China to which 
Beijing can apply pressure. The group is sticking to a straight 
Hong Kong operation. This makes it easier to throw down the 
editorial gauntlet to the Post. If the Post gives up its 
pro-democracy line, it will hand its readers to the Express. 
The Post's daily editor, David Armstrong, even found it 
necessary to make a speech to his own journalists reaffirming 
the paper's commitment to doctrines such as democracy and 
freedom of expression. If anything, says one senior Post 
editor, the paper is now trying to sound more pro-democracy than 
the Express. In the English-language market, Beijing's efforts 
to control the Hong Kong media have opened a Pandora's box. 
  Among broadcasters, China has fewer problems. Hong Kong's 
main broadcaster, Television Broadcasts Ltd. (TVB), will this 
year launch a satellite service in China that is entirely 
dependent on the cooperation of government-controlled cable 
networks. TVB, in which Robert Kuok is also a major 
shareholder, needs good relations with Beijing. So far, that 
hasn't been a problem. After it bought the rights to a 
controversial documentary depicting Chairman Mao as a tyrant and 
a womanizer, for example, it chose--apparently under pressure 
from China--not to broadcast the film. 
  TVB's smaller competitor, ATV [Asia Television Ltd], is also 
eyeing the China market. There is some evidence that China 
ambitions have already affected the broadcasters' Hong Kong news 
output. In one incident, both companies last year arranged and 
then suddenly canceled interviews with Chinese dissident Wei 
Jingsheng. Both stations rejected claims that this was the 
result of pressure from Beijing. But neither offered 
satisfactory explanations. TVB said it had already interviewed 
Wei. The interview, though, was not organized by the company's 
news editors but by independent journalists acting on their own 
initiative. One disenchanted Hong Kong television reporter, 
reflecting on the case, claims Beijing already has much 
influence in the industry: "You end up doing New China News 
Agency propaganda," she says. 
  While that may be exaggerated, China's willingness to use 
leverage to influence the Hong Kong media is not. Three and a 
half years before Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese sovereignty, 
just one Chinese language newspaper, the Economic Journal, is 
willing to contradict Beijing on political issues. Its editor, 
George Shen, says simply: "We are the only one left in the 
group." 
  Some observers of the Hong Kong media, however, are not as 
pessimistic. Johnny Lau Yui-siu, deputy editor in chief of 
China- watching magazine Contemporary Monthly, has personal 
experience with the problems China's media regulators face. For 
16 years he was a reporter for the Beijing-funded daily Wen Wei 
Po, until he and his paper published candid accounts of the 
killings of June 4, 1989. In effect, one of Beijing's own 
newspapers in Hong Kong turned against it. As Lau points out, 
controlling proprietors is not necessarily the same as 
controlling journalism: "The thinking of Beijing," he says, "is 
often frustrated." 
  Lau argues that China's media task in Hong Kong is more 
difficult than has been made out: "I think even if the bosses 
are accepting the call of the so-called United Front (in support 
of China)," he says, "if the demands of the audience remain the 
same, new papers will come out." The arrival of Eastern Express 
appears to prove Lau right. 
  Express editor Stephen Vines notes that a key advantage for 
publications that do not toe Beijing's line is that they find it 
extremely easy to recruit good journalists. "It's quite a 
popular option to come and work here given the state of the Hong 
Kong press," he says. The question, of course, is whether his 
journalists will still have a job after 1997.

  [Text] Beijing, June 6 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese assistant 
minister of foreign trade said here today that China regards it 
important to develop further its economic relations with members 
of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation Organization (APEC). 
  At the opening ceremony of the 3rd APEC Trade Promotion 
Training Course and the 4th APEC Trade Promotion Seminar here 
this morning, Sun Zhenyu, assistant minister of foreign trade 
and economic cooperation, said that China's major trading 
partners and markets are in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  China's import and export volume with other APEC members has 
made up 75 percent of its total trade, and 90 percent of foreign 
direct investment China has so far used originated from APEC 
members. 
  The seminar is the first APEC has held in China, which 
joined 
the organization in 1991. 
  At the three-day seminar, Chinese trade officials and 
academics will exchange information, views and experiences on 
trade promotion with other participants.

<F P=106> ["Special commentary" by Fang Ming (2455 2494): "NATO and </F>
Russia"] 
  [Text] While attending the meeting of defense ministers of 
the North Atlantic Cooperation Council in Brussels on 24-25 May, 
Russian Defense Minister Grachev stated that Russia would 
"unconditionally" sign the "partnership for peace plan," but he 
stressed that Russia must first establish a bilateral security 
mechanism with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). 
NATO was not willing to compromise and so the two sides laid 
aside the issue of signing the "plan" once more. 
  NATO's "partnership for peace plan" was put forward in 
January this year. To date, 18 East European countries, 
countries separated from the former Soviet Union, and neutral 
countries of Europe have signed the "plan" with NATO and five of 
the partners have submitted "memoranda of cooperation" to NATO. 
The "Partnership for Peace Plan Coordination Group" formed by 
military officers of the partnership states was set up at NATO's 
Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe on 18 April, the 
liaison group will start work at NATO headquarters on 3 June, 
and the partnership states will carry out joint military 
exercises in the next few months. The implementation of the 
"partnership for peace plan" will undoubtedly strengthen NATO's 
position and role in modeling a new pattern for the future 
security of Europe. 
  However, the plan has also met many problems: a crisis of 
confidence in the "plan" among East European countries; 
different views among NATO member states, difficulties in 
raising the large amount of funds needed for the implementation 
of the plan, and so on. However, the greatest difficulty is how 
Russia should join the "partnership for peace." 
  Since the beginning of this year, many negotiations on 
Russia 
joining the "plan" have been held within NATO and between NATO 
and Russia. Russia has changed its position on several 
occasions and this has greatly troubled NATO. The two sides 
have reached an impasse on the issue of a "special 
relationship." In the beginning, Russia adopted an attitude of 
opposing the "plan" and later expressed on 21 April its 
willingness to sign the "plan" with NATO under the condition 
that NATO should give Russia the "status of a special 
partnership state." Because NATO did not agree to meet Russia's 
demand and other factors, Russia did not sign as scheduled. In 
addition, Russia also formulated a "document on cooperation 
projects" which it intended to sign with NATO. The document 
demands that NATO should inform Russia about bilateral 
activities with other partnership states and that should NATO 
take any action which involves the security and interests of 
Russia or other members of the CIS, it first obtains the 
agreement of Russia, and Russia may carry out joint exercises 
with NATO within the scope of peace-keeping and other 
humanitarian activities, but will not cooperate with NATO in the 
formulation of military strategies, defense budgets, the 
modernization and standardization of weapons, training of 
military officers, and so on. On 6 May, Grachev announced in 
Moscow that Russia had drafted new ideas on the "partnership for 
peace" concerning the security of Europe which would enable 
Russia to "play its role in the establishment of a collective 
security structure in Europe." 
  It appears that the main considerations which have caused 
Russia to change its attitude of opposing the "plan" to joining 
it on certain conditions are as follows: The first is to avoid 
being isolated and to maintain a distance in relations between 
NATO and the countries of central and Eastern Europe. The 
second is to try to establish a special relationship with NATO, 
to jointly manage the countries of central and Eastern Europe 
with NATO, and to gradually turn NATO's plan into Russia's 
strategic idea of a "pan-European partnership relationship" so 
that Russia can play a greater role in any European security 
system in the future. The third is to alleviate differences and 
contradictions on this issue within Russia. 
  At present, NATO can be said to be in a dilemma. On the one 
hand, NATO knows full well that it is impossible to stabilize 
security in Europe without Russia, and it therefore hopes Russia 
will join the "plan." This would make use of Russia's strength 
and influence and could also transform and restrain Russia. On 
the other hand, NATO does not want to give a special position to 
Russia. Otherwise, other partnership states will be disappointed 
and dissatisfied. At the same time, NATO wants to prevent 
Russia from making use of such a special relationship to take an 
equal footing and to change the original objective of the 
"plan." At present, people at NATO's highest level are stepping 
up negotiations with various sides and are striving to reach 
special cooperation with Russia while not openly recognizing 
Russia's special position. Since neither NATO nor Russia wants 
to return to a state of hostility, they may eventually sign the 
"plan" on the basis of compromise, but this does not mean 
differences between the two sides will be removed. Cooperating 
with each other while struggling against each other will be a 
major characteristics of the "partnership for peace" between 
NATO and Russia. As for how things develop, the "plan" may be 
like the Conference on Security and Cooperation of Europe or the 
North Atlantic Cooperation Council and could become merely 
nominal. At the least, the original idea of the United States 
and the NATO states will be changed.

  [Text] Geneva, June 6 (XINHUA) -- The Bosnian cease-fire 
talks between the warring factions started here today following 
a confirmation of total withdrawal of armed Bosnian Serbs from 
the U.N.-declared exclusion zone around Gorazde. 
  The talks, scheduled for June 2, were postponed because the 
Muslim side refused to show up at the talks before the Bosnian 
Serbs withdraw from the U.N.- protected area. 
  Earlier today, the Bosnian Army command and U.N. 
peace-keeping force confirmed the pullout of the Serb troops 
from the zone, clearing the way for the truce negotiations. 
  Akashi met Bosnian Vice-President Ejup Ganic, Bosnian Croat 
leader Kresimir Zubak and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic 
separately today to discuss with them his draft proposal for the 
cease-fire talks. 
  It was reported that Akashi was calling for a four-month 
truce with separation of forces and withdrawal of heavy weapons 
from conflict lines. 
  Face-to-face talks among the warring factions are expected 
on 
Tuesday [7 June].

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Wu Xiaojun and Liu Shun: "Non-Aligned </F>
Movement Seeks To Play More Effective Role"] 
  [Text] Cairo, June 3 (XINHUA) -- Foreign ministers or 
representatives from 109 Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) member 
states gathered in Cairo from May 31 to June 3, discussing 
future role of the NAM under the new world situation. 
  The world has seen great changes since the ending of the 
Cold 
War with the disintegration of the former Soviet Union. How to 
face the new challenges and make NAM become more effective 
through adjustment becomes a focal point of discussion during 
the four-day 11th NAM foreign ministerial conference. 
  U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's envoy to the 
conference spoke on behalf of Butrus-Ghali that the Non-Aligned 
Movement, as other world organizations, came to a cross-road and 
needs to reaffirm its duty in today's world. 
  The envoy asserted that as an inter-continent movement, NAM 
can play a special role in the international political sphere. 
  Delegations to the conference confirmed that as an important 
forum and channel for maintaining the interest for developing 
countries, NAM also has its own function. Its principle of 
independence, self-determination, non-alignment, non-blocking 
and maintaining world peace, disarmament and establishing new 
international economic order still has vitality. 
  The ministers pointed out that the NAM countries should 
strengthen its coordination and take unified stands on major 
international issues, in a bid to produce more voice in the 
United Nations and strengthen negotiating power in dialogue with 
the developed countries. 
  It is widely agreed that peace and development are still two 
major task for the NAM. Egyptian President Husni Mubarak said 
at the conference opening ceremony that facing the challenges 
posed by the changes in the world, the Non-Aligned Movement is 
required to stand up as representative of the whole developing 
world and strengthen its coordination with Group [of] 77. 
  As for security issues, many delegates to the conference 
expressed concern over the fightings and conflicts in some 
developing countries. They called for peaceful and political 
means for solving the conflicts and fightings in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, Rwanda and Yemen. 
  Ministers said the developing countries witnessed sluggish 
economic growth due to historical reasons, unfare trade [as 
received] and debt problems. Thus they should make persistent 
efforts to build a new international economic order. 
  They called on the movement to promote South-South 
cooperation and South-North dialogue and has closer contacts 
with Group 77. 
  Govind Narain Srivastava, Indian delegate to the conference, 
said the end of Cold War does not mean that the Non-Aligned 
Movement has outlived its utility. 
  He said, "It is widely agreed that although political items 
will continue to attract attention of the movement, the major 
focus will, certainly, be on the economic issues." 
  As the gap between the developed and developing world 
widens, 
the movement shall have to assign maximum priority to the 
economic contents and take concerted action for economic 
prosperity, he added. 
  Though the ministers said the movement should strengthen 
coordination among its member states in economic field, most of 
them believed that the NAM would play a greater role in the 
political sphere. 
  The conference concluded with the issuing of the "Cairo 
Declaration," which will be the guidelines for the approach of 
the 109-member movement toward political and economic issues of 
interest to NAM countries. 
  The Non-Aligned Movement was established in 1961. South 
African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo participated in the 
conference and his country was accepted as NAM's 109th member 
state.

  [Text] Washington, June 6 (XINHUA) -- Henry Kissinger and 
Cyrus Vance today hailed President Clinton's decision on 
extending most-favored-nation treatment status for China and 
decoupling that status from human rights issues. 
  The result of this "difficult but correct decision," they 
said, is a New China policy, which "will better serve both 
American interests and those of peace and stability in Asia." 
  The two former secretaries of state made the comments in an 
article entitled "The Right decision", published in the 
WASHINGTON POST Monday [6 June]. 
  They pointed out that America's broader interests in Asia 
"require a reasonable relationship" with China, and that peace 
and economic progress in Asia are in America's interest and 
require Chinese-American cooperation. Stability in Asia is in 
America's interest but is only possible if both America and 
China are engaged in its pursuit. "Withholding MFN would have 
ruptured one of the world's most important bilateral and 
potentially productive relationships," they noted. 
  They went on to say that the United States and China share 
many other interests in the region, which "can best be advanced 
through a regular, comprehensive and frank dialogue at the 
highest levels." they described the meeting in Seattle last 
November between President Clinton and his Chinese counterpart 
Jiang Zemin as "a useful first step," and expressed the hope 
that "with the MFN decision behind us the two leaders will 
establish a strategic dialogue between our two countries." 
  Praising the administration's New China policy for opening 
the door to broadening and strengthening U.S.-China relations, 
they reminded that pursuing better relations with Beijing is not 
a favor which America bestows on China. "It is in America's 
interests. America and China need each other in our mutual 
search for regional stability." 
  Referring to the importance of China's cooperation to the 
United States on a number of major issues, Kissinger and Vance 
warned that China's cooperation on these matters cannot be taken 
for granted. "China will base its decisions on a hard-headed 
assessment of its own national interests, as will we. Settling 
the MFN-human rights issue, vital as it is, does not guarantee 
smooth sailing on other issues." 
  But they stressed in the article that cooperation is more 
likely to be forthcoming "if Washington and Beijing both work to 
strengthen the central strategic relationship between our two 
countries."

<F P=106> ["Round-up" by Wang Nan: NAFTA, Five Months in Effect] </F>
  [Text] Washington, June 6 (XINHUA) -- Uncle Sam's imports 
from Mexico are rising faster than the country's exports to the 
south of its border. 
  And its trade surplus with Mexico, long a pride for 
Washington, is shrinking. 
  Who is to blame? The North America Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA), the sluggish Mexican economy, or the U.S. economy, 
where recovery is steady with growing appetite for anything that 
is foreign? 
  In the first quarter of this year, the Department of 
Commerce 
reported, U.S. imports from Mexico increased by 22.5 percent, as 
compared with the increase of its exports to Mexico, which stood 
at 16 percent. 
  During the same period, the department said, the U.S. trade 
surplus with Mexico declined by 45.1 percent, to 560 million 
U.S. dollars. 
  NAFTA, effective since the beginning of this year, 
eliminated 
the tariffs of half of the goods traded between Washington and 
Mexico city. The tariffs of others are scheduled to be phased 
out in 15 years. 
  Mexico's trade barriers are high. Peso is strong. And it is 
almost the consensus of economists and trade analysts that once 
the tariffs are eliminated, Mexico's imports from the U.S. will 
grow faster. 
  The big three U.S. automakers in Detroit already said that 
they are able to export some 55,000 vehicles to the south of the 
border in 1994. 
  But at the same time, Mexico's car exports to the U.S. 
climbed 48.3 percent in the first quarter to 728 million dollars 
as compared with the same period last year, according to the 
Department of Commerce. 
  NAFTA is expected to create some 200,000 jobs in this 
country 
before the end of 1995, the government said. Some 30,000 jobs 
have been created so far. 
  Speaking over the weekend, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor stressed that the content of the U.S. trade with Mexico 
and the increase in U.S. exports to Mexico are more important 
than the balance of trade. 
  In a recent poll of 1,500 manufacturers across the country 
by 
the Coopers &amp; Lybrand, half of the companies said that they 
are 
considering doing business in Mexico. 
  More than 76 seminars on exporting to Mexico were sponsored 
by the Department of Commerce across the country in the first 
three months of this year, joined by 17,000 enterprises. 
  Observers, meanwhile, argued that the projected job creation 
in the U.S. is based on the continually rising U.S. trade 
surplus with Mexico. 
  Now the trade surplus is declining, the Mexican economy is 
not as good as before, and the growing U.S. imports of foreign 
goods sees no end, the jobs created by a single free trade 
agreement won't be too many. 
  Adding to the complexity, observers noted, are the 
provisions 
of the NAFTA, which, until today, are making many of the 
American businessmen willing to go to Mexico more bewildered 
than willing.

  [Text] Tianjin, June 7 (XINHUA) -- China has just 
concluded exploration in the sea areas 200 km east of Wenzhou, 
Zhejiang Province, marking the successful beginning of the first 
Sino-foreign oil exploration project in the East China Sea. 
  The exploration, jointly undertaken by China National 
Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOC) and Texaco, of the United 
States, started at the end of March, according to a spokesman 
from CNOC. 
  The Sino-U.S. team completed a seismic survey 100 meters 
down, despite harsh weather conditions at the sea. 
  The East China Sea Oil Exploration Project is a new frontier 
for the China National Offshore Oil Corporation in 750,000 
square km of sea. Before this, China had independently 
conducted seismic surveys in 150,000 square km since 1979 and 
drilled five experimental wells, four of which have shown 
excellent oil prospects. About 1,000 oil-bearing structures 
have also been found. 
  To speed up the development of oil exploration in the East 
China Sea, China conducted the Fourth International Invitation 
for bids for 20 locations in 72,800 square km of sea from June 
1992 to June 1993. Some 73 companies from 19 countries competed 
for the projects and 15 oil exploration companies from seven 
countries succeeded in the bidding, with the total risk 
investment of 300 million U.S. dollars. 
  The successful end of this phase of prospecting in the 
contracted area will provide scientific basis for the upcoming 
drilling of the first well this October, the spokesman said. 
  About 21 experimental wells are expected to be drilled by 
the 
end of 1996.

  [Text] Beijing, June 5 (XINHUA) -- The First Sino-U.S. 
Symposium on Environmental Monitoring and Management was 
inaugurated here today to coincide with the "World Environment 
Day". 
  Some three hundred Chinese and American experts, scholars 
and 
government officials attended this morning's opening ceremony. 
  They will hold comprehensive talks on environmental 
monitoring, management and related technology as well as on 
problems confronting them in their endeavors to protect the 
environment, said Wang Yangzu, vice-chief of China's National 
Environmental Protection Agency. 
  Wang, calling the U.S. one of the pioneers in the world in 
environmental monitoring and protection, said the meeting would 
"give a push to China's campaign to monitor the environment.". 
  Si Duk Lee [name as received], the U.S. delegation 
president, 
said that environment-related factors are playing an ever bigger 
role in global economic development. He voiced the hope that 
the two countries' environmental protection departments would 
enhance cooperation.

  [Text] Beijing, June 6 KYODO -- High-ranking North Korean 
military officers arrived in Beijing on Monday [6 June] for 
talks with the chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's 
Liberation Army, general Zhang Wannian, China's official XINHUA 
NEWS AGENCY reported. 
  The delegation from Pyongyang, headed by Choe Kwang, chief 
of 
General Staff of the Korean People's Army, was invited by the 
Chinese General Staff Headquarters. 
  The XINHUA dispatch did not give any details about the 
content of the talks, which were held later in the day. 
  Leaving aside North Korean President Kim Il-song and son Kim 
Chong-il, who holds the post of supreme commander of the North 
Korean Army, Choe ranks No. 2 in the North Korean military 
hierarchy after Armed Forces Minister O Chin-u. 
  Choe's visit to China is the first by a General Chief of 
Staff since August 1989. 
  Given the rising tension on the Korean peninsula with North 
Korea's failure to dispel international suspicion that it is 
pursuing a nuclear weapons program, both sides are expected to 
discuss responses to possible developments in the controversy, 
such as U.N. sanctions. 
  North Korea has warned that it will consider the imposition 
of sanctions a "declaration of war." Political observers said 
the dispatch of a top-ranking military official to longtime ally 
China at this stage of the nuclear row is aimed at demonstrating 
the close relations between Beijing and Pyongyang. 
  As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, China 
can 
wield its veto to block any punitive action against the North, 
which the United States, South Korea and Japan have been urging. 
  In contrast, by initiating talks with the North Korean 
military leaders, the communist country's hard-liners, it looks 
as though Beijing, which has advocated a negotiated solution, 
hopes to sound out whether Pyongyang is keen to diffuse the 
looming nuclear crisis.

<F P=106> ["Evening talk" column by Yang Chu (5017 2612): "Opposing </F>
Imposition of Sanctions; Dispatch of Troops Unlikely"] 
  [Text] "Being Unofficial" 
  The five permanent members of the UN Security 
Council--China, 
Britain, the United States, France, and Russia--began to discuss 
the Korean issue today. 
  Since the DPRK is accused of not cooperating with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] by refusing to accept 
inspections of its nuclear facilities, the United States has 
called for the imposition of economic sanctions on the DPRK. 
  It is said that China is opposed to the immediate 
convocation 
of a full meeting of the 15 members of the UN Security Council, 
therefore, a session of the five permanent members will be held 
first and will be "unofficial." 
<H5>  Being Marathon </H5>
  It is also said that the unofficial meeting of the five 
major 
powers could continue for several weeks. 
  Several weeks are enough time for many things to occur 
outside the meeting. In other words, before the five major 
powers come to a conclusion regarding whether or not they will 
impose sanctions, activities external to the meeting intended to 
alleviate the tension and find a way out may have already borne 
fruit, the economic sanctions proposal may not need to be 
officially proposed, and China may not need to choose between 
vetoing or abstaining from vetoing a decision. 
<H5>  International Meeting? </H5>
  Regarding Russia's proposal to hold an international 
conference to discuss the Korean nuclear crisis, DPRK Foreign 
Minister Kim Yong-nam, who is currently visiting Kiev, Ukraine, 
said: "We are interested in it and studying it." He did not 
say no. 
  As for Beijing, foreign dispatches reported that Chinese 
Foreign Ministry officials say they will seriously consider 
Russia's proposal to call an international meeting. But the 
government's XINHUA News Agency has yet to release such a report. 
  China had favored a quadripartite trilateral [as published] 
meeting of the DPRK, ROK, the United States, and the IAEA to 
resolve the Korean crisis. 
<H5>  Quadripartite Trilateral Meeting </H5>
  Yesterday, Chen Jian, Chinese deputy representative to the 
UN 
Security Council, said in the United Nations: "We think the 
possibility of resolving the problem through dialogue between 
the parties directly concerned still exists." 
  His remarks still mean that China favors a quadripartite 
trilateral meeting to resolve the problem. They did not 
contradict "seriously considering" Russia's proposal and this 
cannot be interpreted as a change in the original stance. 
  "Seriously considering" leaves a little more room for 
maneuver and, when necessary, one more choice. 
<H5>  Choe Kwang's China Visit </H5>
  Another noteworthy news item today is that the DPRK Chief of 
General Staff Choe Kwang is leading a DPRK military delegation 
on a visit to Beijing. At a banquet in their honor, General 
Zhang Wannian, the Chinese Chief of General Staff, mentioned the 
traditional friendship established in blood between the Chinese 
and Korean peoples and between their armies . 
  Earlier, the DPRK announced that if economic sanctions were 
imposed, this meant war. People were therefore prompted about 
whether Choe Kwang's China visit had something to do with 
preparations for war? They were reminded of the movement to 
resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and of the Chinese 
volunteers who bravely and heroically crossed the Yalu River in 
the early 1950's. 
<H5>  Two Will Not's </H5>
  Will such a thing happen? 
  No. 
  We can come to this conclusion now from two things. 
  First, China will not agree to economic sanctions against 
the 
DPRK in the UN Security Council. Second, China will not 
dispatch troops to become involved itself in a "Korean war"--a 
"Korean war which will most probably not occur.

  [Text] Beijing, June 6 (CNS) -- The Chief of General Staff 
of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), General Zhang 
Wannian, met a North Korea military delegation here this morning. 
  The North Korea delegation arrived in Beijing this morning 
for a one-week visit at the invitation of General Zhang. The 
delegation was headed by the chief of general staff who was the 
highest-ranking North Korea military official to visit China 
since 1992. 
  General Zhang gave the delegation a warm greeting and said 
that traditional friendship between China and North Korea was 
forged by the people and the military of the two countries by 
means of blood. He added that North Korea achieved great success 
and that China was pleased to see such achievements. 
  The senior Chinese official said that the visit by a North 
Korea military official of such high rank was significant for 
the military history between the two countries and that China 
highly valued the visit. 
  The visiting North Korea official said that friendship 
between the two countries tended to have better development in 
spite of complicated international situation. He added that 
exchange and cooperation between the military sectors of the two 
countries were proceeding smoothly. He went further saying that 
North Korea would try every possible means to consolidate 
friendship with China as it had done in the past.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "China, ROK Sign Pacts To Promote </F>
Cooperation"] 
  [Text] China and the Republic of Korea (ROK) yesterday 
signed high-profile agreements on industrial cooperation. 
  The two countries plan to join efforts especially in the 
production of auto spare parts and television sets, as well as 
the development of civil aviation and programme-controlled 
switch system technologies. 
  The event in Beijing was hailed by South Korean officials as 
a crucial part of what they billed as the "Kim-Jiang Vision" of 
bilateral economic collaboration. 
  The vision took shape late last year when Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin and ROK President Kim Yong-sam met at the summit of 
Asia-Pacific nations in the United States city of Seattle. 
  And during Kim's visit to China in March, the two 
governments 
agreed to set up the Sino-ROK Industrial Co-operative Committee, 
which seeks mutual benefit from each other's industrial 
priorities. 
  The agreement was signed by Wang Zhongyu, Minister of the 
State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC), and Hwang Pyong-tae, 
the ROK Ambassador to China. 
  SETC is responsible for the macro development of China's 
industries. 
  Wang will lead Chinese officials from nine ministries to 
Seoul later this month to attend the first session of the 
cooperative committee. 
  A memorandum on civil aviation technical cooperation between 
the two governments was also signed in Beijing yesterday. 
  Hwang Pyong-tae said the new agreements would help diversify 
bilateral economic co-operation, which has largely been focused 
on trade only. 
  The Republic of Korea's industrial giants like Hyundai, 
Posco, Daewoo, Goldstar, and Samsung have begun direct 
investments in China in the last few years. ROK investors are 
particularly interested in carving off a slice of the Chinese 
automotive, steel, electronics and telecommunications markets. 
  Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said yesterday that the two 
nations should promote co-operation in industrial development, 
production and sales in a wide range of sectors. 
  SETC officials said the two economies are complementary, and 
enjoy good prospects for further co-operation.

1993, a contract to build a Sino-Korean undersea optical fiber 
cable communications system, the second international undersea 
optical fiber cable system in China, was formally signed in 
Beijing recently. This system will be built in cooperation with 
the directorate general of telecommunications under the Ministry 
of Posts and Telecommunications, the telecommunications company 
of the ROK, and the Alcatel company of France. To satisfy the 
increasingly higher international communications demands of 
China and the ROK, the directorate general of telecommunications 
under the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the ROK 
telecommunications company decided to build a Sino-Korean 
undersea optical fiber cable communications system. It is 
reported that this system links China's Qingdao with the ROK's 
Taean, and its total length is about 550 km.

  [Text] Beijing, June 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin has called on Asia-Pacific countries to strengthen 
contacts and learn from each other's strong points so that the 
countries in the region can realize common prosperity. 
  Jiang made the call at a meeting today with the ASEAN 
Interparliamentary Organization (AIPO) delegation headed by Jose 
C. de Venecia, speaker of the House of Representatives of the 
Philippines. 
  Much potential is yet to be tapped in expanding economic 
cooperation between China and ASEAN countries, Jiang said, 
adding that there is already a sound base for mutual beneficial 
cooperation and the prospect for further cooperation is bright. 
  While extending a welcome to the AIPO delegation, Jiang said 
the speaker and all the parliamentarians in the delegation are 
old friends of the National People's Congress (NPC) and of the 
Chinese people as well. The delegation members have for many 
years done a lot of useful work in enhancing ASEAN-China 
relations and promoting exchanges between AIPO and the NPC. 
  The friendly exchanges between China and the ASEAN countries 
and the friendship between the peoples date back a long time, 
Jiang said. At the moment, he noted, their friendly cooperation 
is deepening continuously, with fruitful results in political, 
economic and scientific and cultural fields. 
  Congratulating China for its magnificent achievements in 
economic development over the past years, De Venecia said China 
has become a "significant force" of stability and development in 
the Asia-Pacific region. He hoped to expand contacts and 
exchanges with the NPC so as to effect a better mutual 
understanding. 
  Present at the meeting were Wang Hanbin, vice-chairman of 
the 
NPC Standing Committee, and Shi Liang, chairman of the NPC 
Foreign Affairs Committee.

  [Text] Beijing, June 6 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
and his Maltese counterpart, Eddie Fenech Adami, today agreed to 
explore further ways of cooperation between the two countries. 
  In their talks, the two prime ministers felt that government 
officials and entrepreneurs of the two countries can use the 
opportunity of the Maltese prime minister's visit to China to 
have discussions on furthering their relations of bilateral 
cooperation. 
  Li noted that great progress has been made since the two 
countries established diplomatic ties 22 years ago. 
  He said the two sides signed agreements on shipping and on 
avoidance of dual taxation. China is keen to explore new ways 
to have mutually beneficial economic cooperation with Malta, he 
added. 
  Adami described Malta-China ties as a fine example of 
friendly cooperation between a big nation and a small one, 
adding that he first visited China in 1978 as an opposition 
leader. 
  After 16 years, he said, he was very pleased to come to 
China 
again and had witnessed the tremendous progress that China has 
made. 
  Adami expressed support for the resumption of China's status 
as a contracting party in the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade, for which Li expressed thanks. 
  Adami invited Li to visit Malta as soon as possible. Li 
accepted the invitation with pleasure. Li said he had planned 
to visit Malta in early 1992, but had not gone because he had to 
attend the summit of United Nations Security Council. Since 
then he had been looking forward to visiting the beautiful 
island of Malta. 
  Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and 
Maltese Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Guido de Marco, who is accompanying Adami, participated in the 
talks. 
  The two prime ministers afterwards answered Maltese and 
Chinese journalists' questions, particularly on economic 
cooperation and trade. 
  Adami said the prospects for bilateral ties are very good. 
Malta had changed its economic development strategy and adhered 
to building the country into a port with services. 
  Adami arrived here at noon today on an official visit to 
China at the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Peng. 
  This afternoon Li hosted a welcoming ceremony for Adami and 
his wife and their party. 
  Among those present were Li Peng's wife Zhu Lin; Qian 
Qichen; 
Zhao Weizhi, vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Jiu 
San (September 3) Society, and Shi Guangsheng, chairman of the 
Chinese Government Reception Committee. 
  This evening, Li gave a banquet in honor of the Maltese 
visitors at the state guesthouse.

  [Text] Beijing, June 7 (AFP) -- Foreigners, including four 
Italians from the same family, two Americans and two British 
nationals were among the 160 victims of a China Northwest 
Airlines plane crash near the central Chinese city of Xian, the 
company said Tuesday. 
  A company spokesman interviewed by telephone from Xian said 
a 
ninth "foreigner" who was killed in the crash early Monday had 
not yet been identified. 
  The crash of China Northwest Airlines Flight WH2303, which 
had been carrying 146 passengers and 14 crew members, also 
killed three Hong Kong residents and a Taiwanese. 
  Chinese sources said the unidentified foreigner was Swiss, 
but the Swiss Embassy here refused to confirm the information 
before formal identification. 
  The Italian Embassy here confirmed that an Italian couple 
had 
died along with their son and daughter in the crash of the 
Soviet-made Tupolev-154 aircraft which was travelling from Xian 
to the southern city of Guangzhou. The father of the children 
was reported to be a professor from the Florence Polytechnical 
School. 
  The embassies of Britain and the United States also 
confirmed 
the presence of four of their nationals aboard China Northwest 
Airlines flight Wh2303. The British Embassy added that both of 
its nationals aboard the flight were male but did not provide 
further details. 
  The accident -- the worst in China's civil aviation history 
-- occurred about 30 kilometres (18 miles) southeast of Xian 
near the Qinling mountain range. 
  The English-language CHINA DAILY newspaper said Tuesday that 
"three eyewitnesses said they heard two loud explosions in the 
clouds and then saw a fireball crashing to the ground." 
  A spokesman for the airline company earlier said the plane 
had taken off in bad weather under heavy rain, adding that an 
investigation was immediately launched into the incident. 
  A Civil Air Administration of China (CAAC) spokesman refused 
to comment on the disaster Tuesday. 
  Xian, the ancient imperial capital some 900 kilometres (540 
miles) southwest of Beijing, is where the terracotta warrior 
statues of the emperor Qin Shihuang were found, making the city 
a popular tourist attraction.

<F P=106> [By Ma Lie and Xie Yicheng: "Jetliner Crash Near Xian Kills </F>
All 160 on Board"] 
  [Text] A TU-154 passenger jet liner of China Northwest 
Airlines with 160 people on board crashed yesterday morning near 
Xian, capital of Shaanxi Province. There were no survivors. 
  By 9 pm last night [1300 gmt], the cause of the crash was 
still under investigation. However, rescue teams have already 
recovered the black box containing the flight recording, which 
is being analysed by experts, according to reports from the 
crash site. 
  A source from the Civil Aviation Administration of China 
(CAAC) said Flight No 2303 took off at 8:12 am on a flight to 
Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province. 
  Eight minutes later, the plane lost contact with the airport 
control tower, the source said, and was seen crashing in 
farmland in Mingdu town of Chang'an County soon afterwards . 
  Reports from the scene were confused but the latest 
information said that all the 146 passengers -- including 133 
mainland Chinese plus four Italian, two American, two British, 
three Hong Kong, one Taiwanese and another unidentified overseas 
traveler -- and also the 14 crew members on board the 
Russian-made jet were confirmed as killed. 
  The death toll included four children, according to airline 
sources. 
  Three eyewitnesses said they heard two loud explosions in 
the 
clouds and then saw a fire ball crashing to the ground. Debris 
was scattered across a wide area. 
  Local officials, aviation experts, and medical personnel 
rushed to the crash site upon hearing the news. 
  Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua and leading officials of CAAC and 
the 
Ministry of Labour, including the newly appointed CAAC director 
Chen Guangyi, flew from Beijing to Xian to investigate the case 
soon after the crash was reported. 
  The crash site was 30 kilometres southeast of Xian and 80 
kilometres away from the Xianyang International Airport, where 
the plane took off. It was near the Qinling Mountains but the 
site of the crash was level ground. 
  The incident was the first air fatality in China since last 
November, when an MD-82 airliner of China Northern Airlines 
crashed while landing in the western city of Urumqi. Twelve 
people died in that accident.

  [Text] Beijing, June 6 (AFP)--A technical problem rather 
than pilot error is likely to blame for the crash of a China 
Northwestern Airlines Tupolev-154, in which 160 were killed, 
airline sources and local officials said Tuesday. An airline 
spokesman, speaking from the central city of Xian, emphasised 
that the pilot "had not committed any mistake" in Monday's crash 
  The English-language official newspaper China Daily, 
meanwhile, reported that three eyewitness said they heard "two 
loud explosions in the clouds and then saw a fireball crashing 
to the ground." 
  A spokesman for the government of Shaanxi province said the 
two explosions were caused by the "breakup of the flight deck" 
but denied there had been a fire. "The aircraft debris and 
bodies recovered on the ground bore no scorch marks," he said. 
  The spokesman said: "It is more likely that it was caused by 
a technical problem affecting the plane's structure." 
  The Tupolev-154 which crashed shortly after takeoff from 
Xian 
on a flight to Guangzhou, is an old Soviet-designed aircraft 
with three turbo-jets.

<F P=106> [Article by Feng Chien 7458 0051: "Deng Xiaoping Talks </F>
Again About Arrangements After His Death"] 
  [Text] Confronted with the actual conditions that capital 
construction has continued to expand, inflation remaining high, 
and living standards of staffers and workers having somewhat 
worsened since the beginning of this year, it is said that the 
CPC top echelon continues to focus in the near future on scaling 
down capital construction, exercising strict control over the 
scope of credit, lowering the inflation rate, and firmly 
grasping agricultural production as well as "non-staple food 
supply engineering" in urban areas. According to State Council 
Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, the key to the success or failure of 
reform and development this year lies in whether or not a good 
job is done of reducing the inflation rate and the scope of 
capital construction, whether or not mass sentiment, especially 
of workers and staffers at state-owned enterprises suffering 
deficits, will be stabilized. With a good job done in those two 
aspects, reform and development in the second half of the year 
will enjoy comparatively smooth progress. To fulfill the 
aforementioned targets, the CPC top echelon is sparing no effort 
to conduct macroeconomic regulation and control by resorting to 
administrative means, while slowing the pace of reform for the 
time being. Economists' estimates show that despite the fact 
that the CPC top echelon continues to adopt a "soft landing" 
policy, which has been in practice since the second half of 
1993, in handling economic issues this year to prevent an 
excessive drop in the growth rate, should economic growth and 
inflation rates remain too high, the CPC top echelon is likely 
to adopt control measures of greater magnitude than last year, 
even though Zhu Rongji himself is unwilling to resort to such 
measures. 
<H5>  Deng Xiaoping's New Instruction on Economic Construction </H5>
  A resourceful figure disclosed that one opinion on the 
mainland believes that responsibility for the economy being 
"overheated" should be assigned to Deng Xiaoping's talks made 
during his southern inspection tour; Deng had approved of a 6 
percent growth rate, which he later contradicted in the wake of 
his talks made during this tour. Furthermore, Deng Xiaoping 
insistently stressed decentralization, "filling ponds with water 
to breed fish" [fang shui yang yu 2397 3055 7402 7625]; as a 
result, central control was reduced, the regional imbalance in 
economic development aggravated, and the momentum of blind 
expansion in various localities went out of control. 
  Such opinion had been collected and reported to Deng 
Xiaoping, who did not say anything about it right away. 
However, not long ago, while talking about other issues, 
Deng Xiaoping said: "Taking economic construction as the key," 
reform and opening up, and "development is the last word" [fa 
zhan shi ying dao li 4099 1455 2508 4289 6670 3810], these three 
points are the essentials of what I have advocated; practice 
demonstrates that there is nothing wrong with those three 
points, which have won popular support. To my mind, no major 
problems will surface should the third generation of CPC leaders 
persist in these three points. As to the question of whether or 
not the central authorities should have greater power or less, I 
have not shaped a clear picture in my mind yet. However, this 
issue should be judged by three criteria, namely, whether or not 
it is helpful to social productive force development, improving 
comprehensive national strength, and improving people's living 
standards. No rules should be generally stipulated. For many 
years, we have not found a satisfactory solution to this issue. 
In his days, Chairman Mao wanted to resolve the issue; however, 
the result was overly rigid centralization which affected 
development. In the wake of the Third Session of the 11th 
Central Committee, we have changed past practice; consequently, 
the economy improved. Today, the issue has once again become 
conspicuous, where lies the knot of the issue? That is a point 
leading members of the third generation must resolve. In my 
opinion, historical lessons and experiences should not be 
neglected; on the other hand, problems should be investigated 
and resolved from the angle of reform and development. I have 
long set out that the central leadership must have authority; 
that is one of our political advantages. The problem today is 
that it does not enjoy sufficient authority; at the same time, 
the enthusiasm of localities has not been given full play. 
Primarily it is necessary to have a clear picture of the 
differences between the two aspects. I do not have much energy 
left now, and other old comrades are not working in the 
forefront. I am afraid all we can do is offer some suggestions, 
and we must rely on younger comrades to resolve the issue. 
Younger comrades should make new accomplishments; it is quite 
beyond us old people to take their place. 
  Regarding Deng Xiaoping's aforementioned words, figures of 
political and economic circles made the following analyses: 1) 
Deng is sober-minded, has his own criteria in understanding the 
situation, and does not fully approve of current practices; and 
2) Deng Xiaoping is, perhaps, still examining "leading members 
of the third generation." However, it is quite beyond him now; 
he pins his hopes on leading members of the third generation 
maturing and growing up as quickly as possible. 
  Some source has it that Deng Xiaoping has recently 
told his family members: Do not see my personal role being so 
great; it is far from being so in reality. When Chairman Mao 
passed away, was it not true that the sky did not fall! Now 
everyday the outside world is saying that I am dead or on my 
death bed. When things like that are repeated too often, people 
will get used to it. The key lies in the fact that we have taken 
the right path and the economy has developed. No matter how big 
my role is said to be, it is merely mediocre?! The sky won't 
fall, even if it should fall, there is always someone to support 
it. 
<H5>  The Present Situation Is Characterized by "Political </H5>
Tightening Up, Economic Toughening Up" 
  To generalize the mainland situation today in a popular 
saying, perhaps it is appropriate to quote the phrase "political 
tightening up, economic toughening up." The CPC top echelon 
have all along persisted in "political tightening up" over the 
past few years. To maintain the CPC status of absolute 
leadership, the top echelon first talked about "reform" of the 
political structure, but now they have confined themselves to 
talking about "completion and perfection" only, and retrogressed 
to canceling the political reform plan characterized by 
"separation of the party and government" formulated at the CPC 
13th Party Congress, while basically resorting to the 
traditional political structure corresponding to the traditional 
planned economy to deal with economic restructuring. It is only 
since the second half of 1993 that the top echelon began to pay 
attention to and augment the policy of "economic toughening up," 
with its fundamental characteristic of augmenting central 
macroeconomic control and regulation as well as a central 
dominant role in finance, with more power relegated to 
localities redistributed in the name of "reform" to undergo 
recentralization. Prior to this, the CPC implemented a "soft 
economic" policy in reform, basically characterized by 
relegating power to localities and enterprises to develop the 
market economy. The simultaneous implementation of "soft" and 
"tough" policies in economic reform has shown that the CPC has 
greater room for choice and comparatively greater freedom in 
reform in the economic arena. Reviewing the entire progress of 
reform over the past dozen of years or so, the basic CPC 
strategy was to center on the traditional political structure to 
push economic marketization and liberalization. Namely, "to 
promote being `soft' [in the economy] with `tightening up' [in 
politics]." More often than not, while augmenting political 
control, the CPC would lift excessive restrictions over the 
economy on a wide scale; and it was comparatively rare for the 
CPC to adopt a policy of "simultaneous tightening up" in 
politics and economics. Even in the wake of the "4 June" 
crackdown in 1989, they implemented the policy of "promoting 
`being soft' with `tightening up'" for approximately three 
years; however, the pace of economic reform in 1992 was greater 
than any time in the past. 
<H5>  Traditional Political Structure Can Hardly Conform to </H5>
Economic Reform 
  As of today, the CPC top echelon believe that a basic 
experience in the success of China's reform is to promote it and 
development in the way of "politically tightening up, with 
relaxation in the economy." However, whether or not such 
practice of giving up political restructuring while augmenting 
political control will continue to be effective has increasingly 
become a question. 
  First, the existing political structure in China and its 
operational form can hardly resolve and remove the political 
perplexity and contractions that have arisen in recent years. 
For example, regarding incidents of workers from state-owned 
enterprises petitioning for failure to receive their wages, 
there are few political means for the authorities to resolve 
worker resentment. At last, they could only resort to relying on 
financial allotments to "extend concern" in dealing with such 
problems. 
  Second, the existing political structure in China can hardly 
overcome the phenomenon of corruption. The phenomenon of 
corruption, basically characterized by bartering power for 
money, has spread and expanded. Consequently, the effectiveness 
of the market economy allocating goods and equipment has been 
seriously jeopardized; in addition, the impartiality and 
authority of the party in office, and its governing in social 
and economic administration are seriously injured. According to 
a mainland statistics, the annual loss in state-owned assets was 
approximately 100 million yuan, and a major channel for the loss 
was precisely through bartering power for money, a universal 
malpractice existing in various economic activities. "The first 
responsible persons" of party and government departments at 
various levels have considerable power in their hands to 
intervene in economic life; a mere note or order they wrote 
would give the green light to the sale of assets worth thousands 
and even a hundred million yuan for which the officials 
themselves would obtain huge sum of "commissions" in return. 
The "double-track system" has cultivated a number of 
bureaucrats who live on "bartering power for money," who hold an 
entirely opposing and resistant attitude regarding such 
political requirements as separation of party and government, of 
government and enterprise, of government administration and 
assets management, and democratic supervision, sharing power, 
and balance in power, which fall in line with the law governing 
the market economy; they are even opposed to the central 
authorities retrieving the power in their hands. These people 
and this social strata have shaped into a strong political force 
impeding reform in China. The CPC top echelon's worries about 
failure to effectively overcome such tendencies as "disobedience 
to government orders," "localism," and "each going his own way" 
are attributed to the resistance of the aforementioned political 
force. 
  An important task in China's economic reform is to 
require governments at various levels to implement separation of 
government and enterprises with regards to state-owned 
enterprises, and for government departments to accelerate 
conversion of functions. However, this task is very difficult 
to fulfill, and one of the causes lies in the unwillingness of 
those officials who have fattened their purses by utilizing 
"bartering power for money" under the "double-track system" to 
give up power. The phenomenon of corruption finds its root in 
the "double-track system." Nevertheless, the merger of the 
"double-track system" with the market economic structure can 
hardly be fulfilled by relying on economic restructuring alone. 
  The CPC top echelon's aim in pushing reform this year is "to 
push forward reform as a whole [zheng ti tui jin 2419 7555 2236 
6651,] make major breakthroughs [zhong dian tu po 6850 7820 4499 
4275,] shape a whole range in coordination [pei tao xie tiao 
6792 1152 0588 6148.]" Such an aim for reform can hardly be 
implemented in practice for lack of a design and arrangements in 
political restructuring. Presently, the CPC top echelon has 
increasingly resorted to administrative means to implement the 
reform plan and to resolve pressing issues existing in economic 
life. There is no signs of conversion of the "double-track" 
situation, but a strengthening momentum of the trend to resort 
to administrative means. The government's role in economic life 
seems to be far stronger than the market's role; however, its 
effective role is markedly reduced. From one angle, such a 
phenomenon shows that China's political restructuring is behind 
schedule, which has brought increasingly marked negative effects 
on economic reform. 
<H5>  The Authorities Confront a Dilemma in Inflation </H5>
  We should say that political restructuring being behind 
schedule is a great hindrance to unfolding comprehensive 
economic restructuring in China; another great obstacle to 
pushing economic reform will be the CPC top echelon's dilemma in 
confronting inflation. What accounts for the inflation in China 
today is largely the following causes: 1) Price hikes 
inevitably resulting from the transition from a planned to a 
market economy. This includes conversion from incomplete to 
complete cost accounting, from welfare to operational service 
undertakings, from "implicit" to explicit government financial 
subsidies. 2) Price hikes resulting from China lifting control 
over prices for grains, energy resources, raw materials, 
transportations and tertiary industries which accounted for 
about 60 percent of the rise in the general price level in 
China. 3) Price hikes resulting from investment expansion and 
excessive money. The increase of banknotes in circulation in 
China exceeded 30 percent in 1993 and over 1992, and the lasting 
effects of this continue to be felt this year. 4) The tax 
reform plan presented this year, especially value-added tax, has 
helped push up prices. Of the aforementioned four major causes, 
1), 2), and 4) will continue to have a comparatively strong 
impact on price rises. Perhaps there is little positive meaning 
to controling price rises of goods in those categories; on the 
contrary, it would result in still greater confusion in economic 
life. Thus, the CPC top echelon has focused work regarding 
control over prices on checking the scope of capital 
construction and controling the excessive money supply, while 
resorting to a series of administrative means such as listing 
scores of commodities under supervision and examination, 
suspending trade in coal and steel futures, and strictly 
controlling circulation funds and loans while adopting such 
measures as putting a ceiling on and freezing prices and 
conducting price checks on a wide scale. 
  Despite such steps being effective to certain degree, the 
negative effects resulting from them were comparatively great. 
First, the losses of state-owned enterprises which rely on 
voluminous low interest-rate loans for their survival continued 
to grow, with chained debts rising to 700 billion yuan. Second, 
unemployment pressure has continued to grow, especially a large 
number of workers of large state-owned enterprise are worrying 
about their livelihood because production has been suspended or 
semi- suspended, with very strong resentments fermenting. And 
third, the trends of governments in various places drifting away 
from the central authorities has further aggravated. The 
central austerity policy and taxation and banking reform 
measures presented have not brought localities any substantial 
benefits and power; consequently, localities paid less attention 
to repeated central orders and injunctions, while utilizing 
various fund-collecting channels to enlarge reproduction in 
pursuit of growth rate. 
<H5>  Experts Have Controversial Opinions on Curbing Inflation </H5>
  Under such circumstances, great disputes have surfaced among 
economists who provide the CPC top echelon with strategic 
advice. A number of economists, with Li Yining as 
representative, believe that only by maintaining a 9-10 percent 
economic growth rate will it be possible to fully mobilize 
existing resources, while avoiding wasting them. For this 
reason, a certain degree of inflation is inevitable; 
furthermore, the process of monetizing economic activities as 
demanded by the building of a market economic structure will 
inevitably be accompanied by a high inflation rate to a certain 
degree, but will yield a system in which effective allocation of 
economic resources will be realized. Thus, it is advisable to 
keep the fight against inflation at a moderate level, the 
implementation of the economic austerity policy should be 
appropriate, and focus must be placed on converting the 
managerial mechanism of state-owned enterprises and removing 
chained debts, while allowing enterprises with high economic 
returns to have more sufficient circulation funds and loans to 
promote development, so that the pressure of unemployment might 
be reduced to a minimum. 
  However, another set of economists, represented by Wu 
Jinglian, believe that any form of inflation will only worsen 
the economic situation and result in recession of the entire 
economy as well as political instability. To maintain abnormal 
state-owned enterprises with low economic returns by increasing 
money issuance would not resolve chained debts, but only make 
more funds flow into capital construction, with greater volume 
of products in storage while stimulating the aggravation of 
inflation. Thus, the pressing matter of the day is to maintain 
the magnitude of economic austerity, strictly control money 
supply and loans, promote the conversion of managerial 
mechanism, bankruptcy, and transfer of abnormal state-owned 
enterprises with low economic returns to curb capital 
construction. 
  It was said that the authorities attached importance to and 
appreciated the latter of the aforementioned two opinions. 
However, in late April, inflation was not curbed in China, and 
the authorities had to adopt the opinion of Li Yining's school 
of economists to appropriately relax the magnitude of economic 
austerity and change the targets of circulation fund loans to 
take into consideration the demand of those enterprises with 
better economic returns. However, economists indicated that the 
authorities must raise loan rates again if they wanted to keep 
the general scope of money supply under control while showing 
consideration for the pressing needs of circulating funds for 
various state-owned enterprises. However, deficits of numerous 
state-owned enterprises will be increasingly aggravated, and the 
rise in enterprise production costs will bring along further 
price hikes. Such a dilemma has been a great headache to Zhu 
Rongji. 
<H5>  The CPC Is Likely To Convoke Its Fourth Plenary Session in </H5>
the Near Future 
  During the "politically sensitive" period of April, May, and 
June, any decisions made by the CPC top echelon will come under 
the restriction of consideration for "stability." It is 
estimated that at least after early June, the CPC top echelon's 
policy will gradually be clarified, and the issues surfacing in 
the course of economic reform and development will be placed on 
top of the agenda. Probably, that will be one of the contents on 
the agenda of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 14th Central 
Committee said to be convoked around June.

"Fourth Plenary Session of 14th CPC Central Committee To Be 
Held in Second Half of This Year"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 5 Jun (WEN WEI PO) -- As disclosed by 
authoritative sources here, the Fourth Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee is scheduled for the second half of 
this year. The Fourth Plenary Session will make a decision on 
the issue of macroregulation and control of socialist market 
economy; and the issue of large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises and agriculture will also be the main topics at this 
plenary session. 
  It is said that the other day, the central authorities 
pooled 
personnel from relevant departments and formed a group which 
shall be responsible for writing the plenary session's documents 
and, in accordance with the relevant decisions made by the 
top-level CPC authorities and on the basis of full procurement, 
analysis, investigation, and study of the various situations at 
home, will draw on the relevant experience of other countries 
and draft reports for the session. 
  It was revealed that the CPC top echelon believes that to 
practice socialist market economy, it is necessary to study the 
issue of implementing macroregulation and control in the context 
of a market economy. In exercising macroregulation and control, 
an overall framework should be produced and fundamental measures 
recommended, just like the decision made at the Third Plenary 
Session. The CPC top echelon also thinks that the 
macroregulation and control exercised in the context of market 
economy should concentrate on the use of economic levers and 
legal means. Administrative means are necessary under certain 
circumstances, but as far as the overall macroregulation and 
control are concerned, it should not be used as a chief mode of 
regulation and control. 
  The authoritative sources said that the theme of the Fourth 
Plenary Session recommended by the CPC top echelon has positive 
and immediate significance and considerations. The Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee proposed a 
structural frame for the socialist market economic system. What 
the Fourth Plenary Session will seek to solve are new issues 
concerning management under this new structure. Recently, 
several standing committee members of the Political Bureau of 
the CPC Central Committee went to various places around the 
country to conduct investigation and research. For instance, 
General Secretary Jiang Zemin went to Shanghai, Premier Li Peng 
to Jiangsu and Shanghai, and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji to a number 
of provinces and municipalities. All of them went on those 
inspection tours with the same goal in mind, to obtain 
first-hand material.

<F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Song Jian </F>
(1345 0256) and XINHUA reporter Chu Baoping (2806 0202 1627)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 6 Jun (XINHUA) -- At the National Work 
Conference on Radio Administration in Beijing today, Zou Jiahua, 
vice premier and chairman of the State Radio Regulatory 
Committee [SRRC], stressed that it is necessary to step up radio 
administration and push forward the development of radio 
services. 
  Zou Jiahua pointed out: China has made tremendous progress 
in radio administration over the decades, especially in the 
dozen or so years since we began implementing the policy of 
reform and opening up to the outside world. However, 
development has also brought to light the existing system's 
problems and inadequacies, the prominent ones being overlapping 
government organs, sluggish management, lack of coordination in 
the organizational and command structure, and a monitoring 
system that needs strengthening. These problems may stand in 
the way of the development of China's radio services if we do 
not face up to and resolve them with persistent efforts. 
  He pointed out: The "PRC Regulations on Radio 
Administration" 
promulgated last September provide the fundamental legal basis 
for China's radio administration. The "regulations'" basic 
guidelines are their emphasis on centralized and unified 
leadership and their call for stepping up centralized and 
unified administration and for stepping up legislation, 
planning, and construction of technical facilities. He stressed 
that the "regulations" are a set of administrative rules. Radio 
administrative departments at all levels must implement them 
earnestly in the light of their actual conditions and in 
accordance with the principles of administering according to law 
and strictly enforcing the law and punishing lawbreakers. 
Penalty for typical violations such as defying supervision or 
ignoring administrative rules and regulations should be publicly 
announced. 
  He said: After the regulations were promulgated, it became 
necessary to sort out relevant regulations and formulate 
supplementary ones. The rules that are to be formulated by the 
localities and departments, including the specific regulations 
which the "regulations" referred to as necessary, must not 
deviate from the principles set in the "regulations." Earnest 
efforts should be made to sort out the regulations that were 
formulated by the localities and departments before the 
"regulations" were promulgated. 
  Speaking of structural readjustment, he pointed out: One 
important aspect of the ongoing structural readjustment is 
stepping up centralized and unified administration, with the 
emphasis on the central and provincial levels. The 
responsibility and powers of these two levels should be 
enhanced. Instead of radio regulatory committees, an provincial 
radio regulatory committee agency will be set up at prefectural 
and city levels. All royalties for use of radio frequencies 
should be sent to treasuries at the central and local levels. 
The treasuries will appropriate radio administrative 
departments' operating expenses. 
  He concluded: Emphasizing unified management does not mean 
that the SRRC will take charge of everything. Matters such as 
general principles, legislation, law enforcement, frequency 
distribution, geographical distribution of transmitters, 
frequency planning, and organization of overall airwaves 
monitoring must be handled by the state under unified 
leadership. The purpose of readjusting radio administration is 
to step up administration and to advance the development of 
radio services. Whenever the phrase "stepping up 
administration" is mentioned, we must refrain from exercising 
rigid control and excessive interference to the extent of 
stifling and restricting the development of radio services. 
Administration and development should be closely interrelated 
and mutually complementary. 
  On behalf of the SRRC, Wu Jichuan, vice chairman of the SRRC 
and minister of posts and telecommunications, delivered a report 
on the significance, methods, and requirements of the

  [Text] Beijing, 6 Jun -- Speaking at a recent seminar on 
the work of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC] in 1994, Ye Xuanping, vice chairman of the 
CPPCC National Committee, stressed that CPPCC organizations at 
all levels should attach greater importance to theoretical 
study, and should strengthen research and discussion of theory. 
  Ye Xuanping pointed out that at every important moment of 
the 
party's history when the party faces a major task, there is 
always an upsurge of study to review past work experience and 
correctly understand the situation and tasks. He urged the 
CPPCC to unify their thinking with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and 
successfully push CPPCC work forward. 
  Ye Xuanping said: It is necessary to study CPPCC work and at 
the same time acquire a correct understanding of China's 
national conditions. Only by correctly understanding our 
national condition can the CPPCC find its place, successfully 
carry out its responsibilities, bring its strong points into 
play, and make its due contributions. He continued: The topics 
for research and discussion should be selective. They should 
have theoretical depth and at the same time provide guidance to 
CPPCC work. He said: It is necessary to implement the policy 
of "letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of 
thought contend" in theoretical research and discussion, and 
everyone should be able to freely air their views so as to 
achieve unity in understanding and raise their standards to 
serve for the country's central task.

<F P=106> [By reporter Wang Jinfu (3076 6855 4395)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 6 Jun (XINHUA) -- The CPC Central 
Committee's Central Commission on Politics and Law held a 
national teleconference in Beijing today to make further 
arrangements for vigorously cracking down on major and important 
cases of economic crime. Ren Jianxin, member of the CPC Central 
Committee Secretariat and secretary of the Central Commission on 
Politics and Law, called for intensifying attack on 
embezzlement, bribery, financial fraud, smuggling, and other 
serious economic crimes in the coming days. He particularly 
called for earnest efforts to investigate and try major and 
important cases to push forward the struggle against corruption. 
  Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau and member of the Secretariat; Luo Gan, state councillor 
and secretary general of the State Council; Zhang Siqing, 
procurator general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate; Cao 
Qingze, minister of supervision; and Wang Deying, deputy 
secretary of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, 
attended the conference. 
  According to a briefing, from January to April this year, 
more than 19,000 cases of various economic crimes were placed on 
file for investigation and prosecution by procuratorial organs 
in various parts of the country, of which 12,000 were cases of 
embezzlement and bribery and 6,173 were major cases involving 
more than 10,000 yuan. During the first quarter of this year, 
courts across the country accepted and heard 9,836 cases of 
economic crime, of which 2,591 were major cases involving more 
than 10,000 yuan. A total of 7,130 people were sentenced, of 
which 102 were sentenced to death or life imprisonment. Among 
those sentenced, one person was a vice-ministerial-level cadre, 
nine were department and bureau level cadres, and 35 were 
county-departmental-level cadres. 
  In summing up progress in investigating and trying major, 
important cases during the anticorruption struggle of the 
preceding period, Ren Jianxin said: Thanks to the tremendous 
amount of painstaking work by party committees, governments, 
discipline inspection and supervision departments, and judicial 
organs at various levels, the anticorruption struggle has 
achieved interim results and has halted the spread of corruption 
to some extent. However, our work in investigating and trying 
major, important cases of economic crime still has quite a long 
way to go to resolve the problems on hand, and it falls short of 
the call of the people and the demand of the party Central 
Committee and the State Council; there are still many problems 
to be resolved. He said the main problems are uneven 
development in the struggle; too many obstacles, slow progress, 
and weakness in case handling; and lack of toughness in 
attacking corruption. 
  Ren Jianxin pointed out that in the second half of this 
year, 
public security and procuratorial departments and people's 
courts must concentrate their efforts and focus on main points 
in speeding up investigation and trial of major and important 
cases of economic crime. He said: We must make embezzlement, 
bribery, financial fraud, smuggling, and other criminal cases 
our main focus of our investigation and trial. We must make 
leading party and government organs, judicial departments, 
administrative and law enforcement departments, and economic 
management departments our main focus in economic crime 
investigation. We must assign the most qualified personnel to 
do the job. We must be resolved to remove all obstacles and 
concentrate our efforts on investigating and trying those cases 
involving leading cadres at and above the county departmental 
level. We must publish, one after another, some of the major 
cases having nationwide impact, particularly important cases 
involving crimes committed by leading cadres, in order to 
increase the momentum and enhance their social effect. 
  Ren Jianxin stressed: Whether the work of investigating and 
trying major, important cases can sustain and produce results 
hinges on the leadership. Leading comrades of party committees, 
governments, and departments at all levels must further achieve 
unity in thinking; increase their awareness of the significance 
of investigating and trying major, important cases; enhance 
their sense of mission and urgency; and truly make the 
investigation and trial of major, important cases a major 
political task in the struggle against corruption. Leading 
comrades must earnestly strengthen their leadership over the 
work of investigating and trying major, important cases, 
vigorously support and assist public security and procuratorial 
departments and people's courts in overcoming resistance, 
removing interference, and enforcing the law honestly to achieve 
greater breakthroughs and progress in the struggle against 
corruption. 
  Ren Jianxin demanded: Public security and procuratorial 
departments and people's courts, discipline inspection and 
supervision departments, administrative and law enforcement 
departments, as well as other departments and units must perform 
their duties in accordance with the law, strengthen 
coordination, act in concert, improve case handling efficiency, 
increase case handling speed, and jointly carry out the work of 
strictly investigating and heavily punishing those involved in 
major, important cases. We must enforce strict discipline, 
remove interference, and investigate and affix the criminal 
responsibility of those party and government leaders and law and 
discipline enforcement personnel who pervert justice for a 
bribe, resort to fraud for personal gains, deliberately place 
obstacles and interfere in law enforcement, and shelter or 
connive with criminal elements. We must mobilize and rely on the 
masses, boldly report economic crimes and provide clues to 
vigorously assist judicial departments in gathering evidence and 
arresting and punishing criminal elements. We must ensure there 
are sufficient funds for handling cases, and we must provide 
necessary material conditions for investigating and trying 
major, important cases. 
  Zhang Siqing; Tao Siju, minister of public security; and Gao 
Changli, vice president of the Supreme People's Court, also 
spoke at the teleconference.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Studying Persistently and </F>
Profoundly and Applying What Has Been Studied To Practice--On 
Further Studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping"] 
  [Text] The fourth theoretical study course on Volume 3 of 
the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping sponsored by the 
party Central Committee for principal leading cadres at the 
provincial and ministerial levels has ended. So far, all 
incumbent principal leading cadres at the provincial and 
ministerial levels throughout the country have attended the 
study course once. Study classes and training courses on Volume 
III of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping are being 
held in various parts of the country as scheduled. Taken as a 
whole, the situation in previous studies was good and the 
achievements gratifying. Leading cadres at all levels, 
particularly those at the county sectional level or above, 
should continue to exert themselves and seize the opportunity to 
persistently and profoundly study Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping and apply what has been studied to 
practice in order to raise this study to a new level along with 
the improvement of the entire party's ideology and theory. 
  "Persistently" means that we must persist in studying 
Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's works for a long period. Leading cadres should 
not think that they can relax because they have attended the 
study course, have read Comrade Deng Xiaoping's works once, 
twice, or three times, and have understood the main contents. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's works are simple and easy to read and 
most leading cadres can understand them, but it is not easy to 
master their basic principles or apply them. This requires 
persistent efforts. Of course, unlike the "study course," they 
cannot spend too much time on their studies because they are 
busy with daily affairs, therefore, they should be good at 
fitting in time for their studies. It is necessary to work out a 
feasible plan to combine concentrated study with daily study, 
and collective study with individual study. All leading cadres, 
particularly high-level cadres, should put the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping on their desks and regard his works 
as "mottoes." Whenever they come across problems, they should 
read his works. If they persist in doing this and form such 
habits, they will benefit a lot from it. 
  "Profoundly" means that we should not stop after getting a 
little knowledge but should continue to make arduous and 
profound efforts to master the essence and scientific system of 
Comrade Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. It is necessary, through a period of study, to 
understand the main contents of the theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, the questions expounded by Comrade 
Xiaoping in different periods, his views on certain questions, 
his remarks in different periods, and so on. But this is only 
the "way" to the "hall and room," and we should move forward 
along this "way" and try to thoroughly understand the two major 
issues of contemporary China and contemporary China's Marxism by 
taking all problems in reform and development into account. The 
process of profoundly studying Comrade Xiaoping's theory is a 
process of his theory permeating our minds and a process of 
using the essence and scientific system of his theory to arm our 
minds. Thus, while repeatedly studying the Selected Works 
of Deng Xiaoping, we are required to use his works as 
standards to measure ourselves and as guidance to sum up our 
work. In this way, we will improve our understanding, have a 
good idea of the overall situation, uphold what is correct, 
overcome what is wrong, rectify what is one sided, and really 
arrive at profoundness. 
  Applying what has been studied is the fundamental aim of 
persistent and profound study and is also a basic method of 
studying theory. Comrade Mao Zedong said long ago: "It is 
necessary to master Marxist theory and apply it; the sole 
purpose of mastering it is to apply it." Deng Xiaoping's theory 
on building socialism with Chinese characteristics is 
contemporary China's Marxism. The sole purpose of mastering 
this theory is to use it to analyze and resolve major problems 
in China's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. In 
applying what has been learned, we must make earnest efforts. 
In the course of establishing the socialist market economic 
structure this year, a number of major reform measures have been 
introduced. The current reform is like "storming heavily 
fortified positions," during which many new problems and new 
situations must be properly understood and resolved. We may say 
that practice is urgently calling theory for help; thus, there 
is a vast field for theory to be applied to. Now, the most 
important thing is to make contributions to serving the major 
aspects of the situation. The major aspect of the party's and 
country's work for this year is to seize the opportunity to 
deepen reform, expand the scope of opening up, promote 
development, and maintain stability. The key issue is to 
properly handle the relationship between reform, development, 
and stability. This basic principle of the party Central 
Committee is the result of using Comrade Xiaoping's theory to 
comprehensively analyze and correctly judge the present 
international and domestic situation and is the outcome of 
combining theory with practice. Leading cadres at all levels 
should use Comrade Xiaoping's theory as guidance in deepening 
their understanding of the overall situation and enhancing their 
consciousness and determination to implement the "20-character 
principle." In localities, departments, and units under their 
leadership, they should creatively proceed with their work and 
make practical contributions to promoting reform, development, 
and stability. 
  Persistently paying attention to leading cadres' theoretical 
studies is a "key project" of "arming cadres with a scientific 
theory" and is also the key to making a success of the entire 
party's studies. Party committees at all levels should 
conscientiously sum up their previous experience and do a better 
job of this major issue of fundamental and long-term 
significance.

<F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column by Jen Hui-wen (0117 </F>
1979 2429): "CPC Calls For Recovery of Power From Local 
Authorities in Eight-Point Instruction"] 
  [Text] From 13 to 22 May, Zhu Rongji, member of the 
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central 
Committee and vice premier of the State Council, called an 
economic work conference for the seven provinces of Hubei, 
Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan in Wuhan and 
Zhengzhou. At the conference, he repeatedly stressed that the 
key to stabilizing the situation as a whole is to place the 
focal point of economic work on improving agricultural 
production and state-owned enterprises. This shows that the 
senior CPC leadership already has a new consensus on the 
questions of stabilizing the political situation and economic 
reform. Moreover, it also reflects that two serious problems 
still exist in mainland China's economic restructuring today, 
namely the problems of agriculture and state-owned enterprises. 
Beijing's economists maintain that if these two big problems 
are not resolved properly, it will be impossible for China to 
succeed in reform. 
<H5>  CPC Worries That Problems in Industry and Agriculture Will </H5>
Throw Situation as a Whole Into Confusion 
  According to informed sources in Beijing, the seven-province 
conference called by Zhu Rongji was not just an economic work 
conference, but also a "briefing" for members of the standing 
committees of the provinces' party committees and governments. 
The "briefing" proceeded in keeping with a decision on work 
recently adopted by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central 
Committee. The decision on work instructed leading cadres at 
all levels to "go down to the grass roots, learn about the 
reality, give briefings, find out about their problems, and 
attempt to get work done [zou xia qu, zhang shi qing, da zhao 
hu, bai wen ti, cu luo shi 6382 0007 0637 2222 1395 1906 2092 
2156 0729 2369 0795 7344 0191 5507 1395]." This 15-character 
instruction evolved from a demand set not long ago by General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin on leading cadres. Jiang Zemin had said: 
"Go down to the grass roots, conduct investigations, hold 
informal meetings, find out about problems, and attempt to get 
work done." Later, Zhu Rongji suggested changing the words 
"conduct investigations" to "learn about the reality." Deng 
Xiaoping saw this wording at an internal CPC briefing and felt 
it was okay. He also suggested changing the words "hold 
informal meetings" to "give briefings." 
  Informed sources said that, at the conference, Zhu Rongji 
specifically emphasized the significance of attaching great 
importance to agriculture and state-owned enterprises. He said: 
"The central authorities have always contemplated the question 
of how to further improve agriculture. What the central 
authorities worry about is that if great problems occur in the 
next crucial decade, they will be agricultural problems. 
Moreover, the problem of state-owned enterprise reform must not 
be approached improperly. It is necessary to safeguard the 
immediate interests of more than 120 million staff and workers, 
otherwise, workers will take to the streets, peasants will enter 
the cities, and the situation as a whole will be thrown into 
confusion. It will be self-induced confusion." 
  Beijing's economists pointed out that regarding the problem 
of agriculture, Deng Xiaoping had already given warnings as 
early as early 1991 and early 1993. He said: "China's 
agricultural foundation is still rather weak. If problems ever 
occur in China's economy in the 1990's, they will probably be 
problems in agriculture." Unfortunately, his words have been 
fulfilled. Although the Eighth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC 
Central Committee in November 1991 adopted a special decision 
regarding the issue of agriculture in November 1991, the 
decision has not been thoroughly implemented, with the result 
that the peasants' situation is worsening daily, the gap between 
the cities and the countryside is widening, and peasants' 
dissatisfaction is growing daily. As for state-owned 
enterprises, which consistently derive funds from bank loans, 
shoulder a heavy historical burden, and find it difficult to 
transform their management mechanism, "those that should be 
closed down have not been closed down and those that should 
survive do not operate well." Their profits are decreasing, 
losses are increasing drastically, and economic returns are 
sliding, and the problem of unemployment is worsening daily. In 
view of this, it is not unlikely that self-induced confusion 
could occur. 
  The sources said: In addition to being obliged to review 
policy, the major reason for the increasingly serious problems 
in agriculture and state-owned enterprises is that the local 
authorities do not feel obliged to listen to the central 
authorities. At the briefing, Zhu Rongji said: "At present, 
resistance to the principles, policies, and measures of the 
central authorities is not weak, which makes it very difficult 
to implement them. Some party and government chiefs do not feel 
obliged to listen to the central authorities. They doubt 
whether the central authorities' decisions are right or whether 
or not they suit the conditions in their own localities. This 
phenomenon has caused a chain reaction among the leading groups 
in some localities. If we do not correct this immediately, it 
will not only weaken the central authorities' authority but will 
also affect our work as a whole." 
  A Beijing political 
figure pointed out that the main leaders of the local 
authorities have not been obliged to listen to the central 
authorities for a long time. In a speech to the Third Plenary 
Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission in 
February, Jiang Zemin gave this warning, saying: "Some 
high-ranking cadres do not maintain unity with the central 
authorities in terms of the political line. We are clear about 
this. They should not think we do not know about it." But a 
warning is a warning. The phenomenon where they do not feel 
obliged to the central authorities has not changed but is 
tending to spread. Therefore, it was Zhu Rongji's turn to 
criticize this time. This may have been a declaration about the 
possible dismissal or transfer of local leading cadres who do 
not feel obliged to listen to the central authorities. During a 
working tour of Heilongjiang in mid-April, Zhu Rongji dismissed 
Sun Weiben as secretary of the Heilongjiang party committee. 
  This political figure said: Now, due to their local 
interests and their own face, some local party and government 
chiefs often disregard central policies and shield cadres who do 
not feel obliged to listen to the central authorities. If the 
central authorities do not dare to deal with the shielders, 
regionalism will inevitably expand. But dismissing and 
transferring cadres is not the ideal cure, and this has put the 
CPC authorities in a dilemma. 
<H5>  Central Authorities Demand Localities Maintain Unity in </H5>
Eight Areas 
  The informed sources added: In order to strive to maintain 
unity between leading comrades in local parties and governments 
and the central authorities, the central authorities, while 
dismissing some cadres as a warning, had Zhu Rongji put forward 
eight criteria (namely the eight-point demands set by the 
central authorities on the local authorities) for provincial 
party and government leaders to determine whether they were 
maintaining unity with the central authorities. 
  First, they must attach great importance to agriculture 
as the most important task which has an influence on the 
situation as a whole and must conscientiously implement various 
central agricultural policies; 
  Second, they must not arbitrarily set aside farmland 
for the purpose of setting up development areas or special 
economic zones. 
  Third, they must effectively control inflation and 
promote social stability. 
  Fourth, they must limit the scale of infrastructural 
development and must not arbitrarily pool funds. 
  Fifth, they are forbidden to use funds or credit to 
speculate in real estate, futures and so forth. 
  Sixth, they must not issue shares or debentures, or set 
up financial exchange markets. 
  Seventh, they must not arbitrarily sell the assets of 
state-owned enterprises, still less must they sell them at low 
prices to benefit enterprise cadres, staff, and workers. Those 
who have done so must return the same amount; 
  Eighth, property rights transactions in state-owned 
enterprises set up by prefectural-level cities or above must be 
examined and approved by the State Council and carried out 
according to the relevant regulations. Transactions that have 
not been filed for approval must be stopped immediately and be 
refiled for approval. Authorities at and below prefectural-level 
cities must not organize this kind of transaction. 
  A Beijing economist holds that the central authorities' 
eight-point demand on local authorities are in fact another kind 
of administrative means of control or administrative 
interference. Whether this kind of interference is good or bad 
for economic development is as yet unknown. However, the 
economist pointed out that one of the objectives of reform is 
not to revive the excessive centralization of power of the past 
in another form but to establish new economic relationships 
between the center and localities and between the government and 
enterprises on the basis of a market economy. Viewing the 
matter from this angle, neither an excessive centralization of 
power nor an excessive regionalization of power meets the needs 
of a market economy. As for the question of how to 
appropriately distribute central authority and local authority, 
it depends on whether the distribution is beneficial to the 
development of the productive forces and the development of the 
economy. However, if administrative means are used excessively, 
"economic rectification" will be repeated, and this must be 
guarded against.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] A group of moderate social scientists has vowed to 
promote social change in China through organising a series of 
nonofficial journals and academic functions. Their activities 
are centred around the Chinese Social Sciences Quarterly, a Hong 
Kong-based journal that has a large readership in China. 
  Into its seventh issue, the Quarterly is edited by an elite 
corps of mainland-based scholars who vow to bring about 
evolutionary changes by fostering a "nonofficial academic 
tradition." 
  "We believe in a people-based academic research as 
distinguished from one that is officially sponsored," said the 
Quarterly's chief editor, Deng Zhenglai. "Academic activities 
should not be tied to any ideology, policy, or slogan." 
However, he said that since they believed in deep-rooted 
changes they were taking a gradual approach to solving problems. 
  The bulk of the 39 members on the journals academic board 
are 
nationally well-known scholars many of whom hold senior 
positions in prestigious research units such as the Chinese 
Academy of Social Sciences. They include economists Lin Yifu, 
Fan Gang, and Bai Nansheng, sociologist Wang Funing, and expert 
on international relations Wang Jisi. 
  Mr Deng, one of China's first getihu (individual 
entrepreneur) publishers, has been putting out translations of 
Western classics since the early 1980s. He is in Hong Kong to 
promote academic links between the mainland and the territory. 
  It is understood that out of political sensitivity, the 
Quarterly is published and printed in Hong Kong. However, Mr 
Deng said a few thousand copies were distributed free to 
research institutions, government units, and leading 
intellectuals in the mainland. 
  The Quarterly also holds regular seminars in Beijing and 
Shanghai. 
  Sources in Beijing said since the Quarterly had steered 
clear 
of controversial issues like political reform, it was largely 
tolerated by the Chinese Communist Party. Such liberal leaders 
as Politburo member and National People's Congress Vice-Chairman 
Tian Jiyun have praised the group's research efforts. 
  In recent issues and conferences, the Quarterly has explored 
issues including agrarian reform, the role of a civil society, 
the clash of cultures, and the theory of "neo-authoritarianism". 
  The group will later this year inaugurate a new journal 
called China Book Review, which they claim to be the nation's 
first-ever independent publication in this field. 
  The group's finances come from sales of the publication in 
Hong Kong and overseas as well as donations and grants.

  [Text] Beijing, 27 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--It is 
learned from authoritative departments that by the end of 1994, 
191 enterprises in Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong, will be 
closed down or merged with other enterprises, or their 
production will be stopped or changed, to reduce pollution of 
the Huai He and to keep the water of the river clean. 
  Mass media here have disclosed that the water of the Huai He 
valley is seriously polluted and nearly 50 percent of river 
sections have become useless; in some areas, polluted water has 
been used to irrigate land over a long period resulting in a 
decrease in grain output and the content of pollutants in 
agricultural produce exceeding safety standards; the output and 
variety of fish and shrimp have decreased; and disputes over 
pollution between different localities have become more and more 
conspicuous. In dry seasons, plants often have to suspend 
production. The shortage of water resources has become more and 
more serious and control over the Huai He brooks no delay. 
  A meeting on enforcing laws to protect the environment of 
the 
Huai He valley was held in Bengbu, Anhui, from 24-26 May. 
Besides laws and regulations on prevention and treatment of 
pollution to be revised this year, provisions concerning crimes 
in causing pollution will be added. The formulation of 
"Regulations on Prevention and Treatment of Pollution in the 
Huai He Valley" is also being discussed.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Chen Leqi (7115 2867 7871)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 6 Jun (XINHUA) -- At a recent meeting with 
the press, Chen Hong, vice minister in charge of the State 
Nationalities Affairs Commission [SNAC] said: As a functional 
department of the State Council in charge of the country's 
nationalities affairs, the SNAC will adhere to the policy of 
regarding economic construction as the central task; strengthen 
its macro-management capabilities; and endeavor to promote 
equality, unity, mutual assistance, and common prosperity among 
all nationalities, to preserve the nation's unification and 
stability. 
  It has been learned that the State Council recently approved 
the SNAC's plan on its functional setup, internal structure, and 
organizational size [the "three settings" plan]. According to 
the plan, the SNAC will further strengthen its macro-management 
capabilities; carry through the party Central Committee and the 
State Council's principles and policies on nationalities work 
and the state's laws and regulations on nationalities affairs; 
and step up work on conducting investigation and study, overall 
coordination, and supervision and inspection, in order to serve 
as a counselor and assistant to the party Central Committee and 
State Council on nationalities work. 
  Chen Hong pointed out: The SNAC's "three settings" plan 
approved by the State Council will not only strengthen its 
functions, but also increase its responsibility. This is very 
helpful in doing good nationalities work in the new period, and 
it shows the importance the party Central Committee and State 
Council attach to nationalities work, and the concern they show 
for it. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the SNAC will 
serve well as a counselor and assistant to the party Central 
Committee and State Council, and will apply itself to serving 
minority nationalities and minority nationalities areas.

<F P=106> [By Agatha Ngai] </F>
  [Text] Oxfam's programme director in Hong Kong has warned 
that economic prosperity could endanger the livelihood of 
residents in poorer districts. John Sayer says that Beijing's 
"blind strategy" of attracting foreign investment could backfire. 
  Many villagers in the mountainous regions of southwest 
China, 
mainly unskilled minority tribal groups living far away from 
markets, have no advantages to offer in the competition for 
foreign capital. On the contrary, run-away prices have made it 
more difficult for the peasants in these destitute areas to 
escape poverty, he said. 
  Mr Sayer said Xiao Li, a peasant from Shiyahou village in 
Yunnan, perfectly illustrated how difficult it was for peasants 
in these remote areas just to survive -- let alone get rich. 
Due to poor soil and difficult farming conditions, Mr Li has 
difficulty in growing enough food to support his family. Every 
year, he manages to squeeze the equivalent of about $200 by 
selling his meagre harvests in the markets. 
  For up to six months a year, Mr Li has to borrow from his 
relatives to survive. Mr Li was not lazy, nor did he lack the 
initiative to earn more money, said Mr Sayer, but peasants 
seldom got credits from the Chinese banks to purchase even the 
most basic farming tools needed for their first steps towards a 
decent living. 
  "The soil is poor for growing rice, but it allows planting 
of 
some rough crops for animals," said Mr Sayer. "They survive 
just by borrowing food from relatives. But (in return), they 
lose their self-esteem and become more dependent," he said. 
  The situation only began to improve for Mr Li after he 
obtained a 100 yuan (about HK$89) low-interest loan from Oxfam, 
said Mr Sayer. "Only when they can sell more than they buy, 
inflation can help them to gain more money," he said. 
  The programme director also said he was glad that many 
villagers had adopted year planning in planting their crops. 
"Now they know when to raise chickens and pigs so that they can 
fetch the best market price, say, in the Lunar New Year," he 
said. 
  Mr Sayer described China's seven-year poverty eradication 
programme as "an ambitious plan." But he said Oxfam in Hong 
Kong "never talks about ending poverty." "In Tokyo, there are 
still men sleeping on the street. Instead, we aim at reducing 
poverty," he said. 
  Mr Sayer said the annual income of households in some 
villages in Yunnan and Guizhou, where water and electricity 
supply projects under the charity have taken place, had already 
increased by 78 per cent from 200 yuan. 
  "Yunnan will grow faster in the next two decades (because) 
the border province can construct trade links with Thailand, 
Burma, and Singapore. But regions where markets are almost 
nonexistent, such as Sichuan and Guizhou, will take more years 
to develop," he added. 
  He said Oxfam would expand its development projects to 
southern China this year, focusing on health and hygiene 
problems in the region. "If you're ill, you cannot work," he 
said.

  [Text] Beijing, June 6 (CNS) -- Some 300 cities out of 
over 570 cities in China are suffering from shortage of water 
with 50 in the very serious state of water supply, provoking a 
severe restraint to the economic development in the country. 
  This week is the Water-saving week in China. [sentence as 
published] According to the Ministry of Construction, China's 
overall volume of water resources ranks sixth in the world while 
its per capita water resources is only one fourth of the world 
average. With the rapid economic development in the country, the 
demand for water will greatly increase and the expansion and 
saving of such resources has become an urgent task for the 
country. 
  At a press conference on water-saving in cities in the 
country held today, Vice Minister of Construction, Mr. Ye 
Rutang, pointed out that management over water-saving should be 
strengthened while the water-container leakage problem first of 
all needed to be tackled. 
  The leakage of cisterns in toilets has become a 
long-standing 
problem for water-saving which has even aroused concern of 
General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist 
Party of China, Mr. Jiang Zemin, so that the ministry and the 
National Construction Materials Bureau have decided that 
fittings for washing vessels used in toilets would only be 
allowed to be produced by the ten designated enterprises in some 
cities including Guangzhou, Beijing and Tangshan. [sentence as 
published] 
  In addition, the ministry has greatly encouraged the re-use 
of processed waste water. China has now seen its annual volume 
of drainage of waste water up to 30 billion cubic metres with 
much of it being not re-used. 
  China has in recent years made some achievements in its 
water-saving drive with 13.9 billion cubic metres of water being 
saved in the past ten years, the repeated utilization rate of 
water for industrial purposes in cities across the country has 
increased to 60 percent, and the volume of water exhausted in 
earning RMB [reminbi] 10 000 output value dropped by 60 percent. 
Some cities including Shanghai, Tianjin and Ningbo, have 
effectively controlled their urban surface subsidence through 
tightening management over the use of underground water.

4382): "Introducing Intellectual Resources Is an Important 
Strategy for Stepping Up China's Economic Development--Interview 
With Ma Junru, Director of State Bureau of Foreign Experts 
Affairs"] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 20 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--"In the 
course of establishing the socialist market economy, inviting 
foreign experts to give advice to all trades and industries in 
China, or sending Chinese managerial personnel abroad to receive 
training, will bring great benefit to China's construction and 
development. Introducing intellectual resources to promote 
development is China's strategic policy." 
  Ma Junru, director of the State Bureau of Foreign Experts 
Affairs, said this in a recent interview with ZHONGGUO XINWEN 
SHE. 
  Reportedly, last year, some 50,000 foreign experts were 
invited to work in China. At the same time, China also 
dispatched some 30,000 technical and managerial personnel abroad 
to receive training. Such "two-way personnel exchanges" across 
the national boundaries produced great effects. 
<H5>  Conceptual Revolution </H5>
  Last November, on his return from a training course in 
Germany, a district magistrate in Beijing Municipality discussed 
with his subordinates the issue of establishing an institution 
to manage state-owned assets. Thanks to his efforts, the 
institution was set up quickly and began to function 
effectively. However, two months before that, the district 
magistrate did not have any interest in this matter and he put 
an `X' on the report submitted by his subordinates on the 
establishment of the state assets management institution. 
  The district magistrate and tens of thousands of 
decisionmaking officials in China are gradually becoming experts 
from laymen in the rising tide of the market economy, gradually 
becoming enthusiastic advocators and performers instead of 
onlookers. The conceptual revolution, which is going on 
quietly, has greatly benefited from the enhanced insight of the 
decisionmaking managers and administrators who received training 
abroad in recent years. 
  Ma Junru told this story with deep feelings. The State 
Bureau of Foreign Experts Affairs, which also takes charge of 
these affairs, has boldly advanced the work of dispatching 
managerial personnel abroad to receive training in recent years. 
  According to the traditional practice, only factory 
directors 
and business company managers can be sent abroad to receive 
training and policymaking officials at the higher levels would 
have no such opportunities. If they could make any foreign 
inspection tours, they would just be able to scratch the surface 
rather than learn something profound. Beginning in 1992, the 
convention in this field was broken and policymaking 
administrators could also step out of the country in the 
capacity of students to study the advanced management skills in 
foreign countries. 
  Ma Junru said: Policymaking cadres and senior managerial 
personnel are urgently required to have a good knowledge of the 
market economy. In the practice of building the socialist 
market economy, China should not do everything from the very 
beginning; instead, it should take over the existing successful 
and advanced methods and skills developed by other people. 
Thus, China can avoid undergoing many twists and turns, can 
lower the costs, and can quicken the pace of reform. 
  Last year, when more and more people had a strong interest 
in 
futures, the State Economic and Trade Commission organized a 
number of responsible officials to take a training course about 
futures at Illinois University in the United States and 
practiced in Chicago's large futures market. As a result, the 
trainees acquired a much deeper understanding of the U.S. 
futures market and also had some new ideas about China's futures 
market. Then, they submitted a report about the development of 
the futures market to the central authorities and the report 
aroused the close attention of the central leaders. 
<H5>  Considerable Results </H5>
  Ma Junru, 59, was engaged in microelectronics research for a 
long time. In the past he has been successively director of the 
Basic Research and High Technology Department of the State 
Science and Technology Commission and responsible person of the 
Technological Section of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He 
took up his current post in August 1991. His work experience 
brought about a rigorous work style. In order to explain the 
urgency of introducing intellectual resources in China, he cited 
a string of figures and used "eating a meal" as a figure of 
speech. 
  Several years ago, the State Bureau of Foreign Experts 
Affairs invited Japanese rice expert Masaichi Hara to spread the 
advanced rice cultivation techniques in China. As a result, 
good harvests of rice were reaped in large areas of northeast 
China. The advanced techniques were then further spread to 
Hebei, Xinjiang, and Gansu. Director Ma said: "We have 480 
million mu of paddy fields. If the advanced techniques are 
adopted for all these fields, great results will be achieved" 
  Therefore, the old Japanese expert was given a letter of 
commendation signed by Premier Li Peng. When visiting China, 
the Japanese Emperor also received him at the Diaoyutai National 
Guest House. 
  In the field of manufacturing industry, Shanghai's Dazhong- 
Santana succeeded in producing the cars wholly in China by 
adopting imported technology; Beijing Piano Plant recovered from 
the recession and sold its highly popular products at home and 
abroad; Shenyang Beer also won an award by freeing itself from 
its predicament; and Changsha Air Blowers succeeded in exporting 
its products to overseas markets. All such successes were 
inseparable from the wisdom and hard work of foreign experts. 
<H5>  Long-Term Strategy </H5>
  "Taking in and sending out" is not China's creation, still 
less is it a stop-gap measure only for the time being, said Ma 
Junru. In the world, such countries and regions as Japan, 
Singapore, the ROK, and even China's Taiwan and Hong Kong have 
all adopted similar measures. This played a great role in the 
economic take-off and recovery of these countries and regions. 
In general, they gained greater benefits than the developed 
countries did. 
  As for the import and export of intellectual resources, some 
less developed Third World countries are often "exporters." For 
example, some 100,000 university graduates and well-educated 
professionals from China are now working in the United States; 
but only several thousand American experts come and work in 
China every year. Therefore, China has to make unremitting 
efforts over a long time in order to import intellectual 
resources. 
  According to Director Ma, at present, the foreign experts 
invited by China are mainly engaged in educational and technical 
work, or are working with some large projects and foreign-funded 
enterprises. They are making greater contributions to China's 
reform, opening, and economic development. The authorities 
concerned are considering the plan for introducing intellectual 
resources on a larger scale during the Ninth Five-Year Plan so 
that the work in this aspect will better serve the adoption of 
the state's major reform measures, the transformation of 
management mechanisms in large and medium-sized enterprises, the 
decisions on launching major projects, and the improvement of 
the management of township and town enterprises.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Continuously Enhance Sense of National </F>
Defense, Solidly Foster Idea of Duty--Marking 10th Anniversary 
of Promulgation of `PRC Military Service Law' in Force"] 
  [Text] The 10th anniversary of the promulgation of the 
"Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China" falls 
on 31 May this year. Practice over the past 10 years proves 
that this "Military Service Law" has made important 
contributions to enhancing the whole nation's awareness of 
national defense, strengthening the modernization of national 
defense and the Army, safeguarding state security and social 
stability, and enabling socialist modernization to proceed 
smoothly. It is in line with our national conditions, the 
conditions of the Army, and the general circumstances at home 
and abroad. 
  The enforcement of the "Military Service Law" as a basic law 
governing the modernization of national defense has always been 
and will always be closely bound up with Army building and the 
building of reserve defense forces. The fact that, over the 
past 10 years, the building of national defense and the Army has 
consistently enjoyed a fine atmosphere and care and support from 
the whole society is a result of the conscientious 
implementation of the "Military Service Law" by party and 
government organs at all levels, organizations, enterprises and 
institutions, and all circles of society. The nationwide 
enlistment drive has long stayed at high tide and batch after 
batch of outstanding young people reaching enlistment age vie 
with each other to join the Army and loyally execute their 
honorable obligation to defend their motherland. The personnel 
of our Army have always been young and strong, the services have 
been able to keep a large number of mainstay technical 
personnel, efforts have been made to align the building of 
militia and reserve services with the requirements of people's 
warfare under modern circumstances, the mobilization capacity of 
reserve forces has continuously expanded, proper arrangements 
have been made for large numbers of armymen transferred to 
civilian work and ex-servicemen who play a positive role in 
economic construction, and military training work for the broad 
ranks of students in institutions of higher learning and senior 
middle schools has moved ahead vigorously. All of these have 
benefited from the implementation of the "Military Service Law." 
It is also a result of the mobilization and education provided 
by the "Military Service Law" that the building of militia and 
reserve services has strengthened in an all-round way and has 
played an important role in safeguarding social stability and 
promoting the building of the two civilizations. In short, the 
positive influence of the enforcement of the "Military Service 
Law" on the building of the Army and reserve forces as well as 
the building of the entire country is multifaceted and of 
profound and far-reaching significance. 
  There is an important experience in the 10-year enforcement 
of the "Military Service Law" that deserves to be carried 
forward: Making a good job of the implementation of the 
"Military Service Law" under the new circumstances not only 
depends on the standardizing function of the "Military Service 
Law" itself, but in the meantime cannot go without propaganda 
and education on the strategic significance of implementing the 
"Military Service Law" and all relevant stipulations. The 
officers and men of our Army and the broad ranks of personnel in 
the militia and reserve services should continuously enhance 
their consciousness of national defense and firmly establish 
awareness of their obligation to enlist in the army through 
in-depth study of the "Military Service Law." 
  Making a good job of education in national defense and 
enhancing the sense of national defense is an issue which the 
CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central 
Military Commission have time and again emphasized since the 
beginning of reform and opening up, especially since the 14th 
party congress. This is because it is an ideological foundation 
for strengthening the building of national defense and the Army 
and guaranteeing the implementation of the "Military Service 
Law." This point is ever more important in a peaceful 
environment. If a country or nation lacks a strong sense of 
national defense, it is bound to plunge into no end of crises 
and may even suffer national humiliation and forfeiture of 
sovereignty. If an army or an armed force has a weak sense of 
national defense, even if it is well equipped, it will not have 
a strong fighting will or high combat effectiveness and will not 
be able to win a war. Making a good job of education in 
national defense and enhancing the sense of national defense is 
not only an important aspect, but a primary precondition in the 
implementation of the "Military Service Law." Education will 
help each armyman on active service, militiaman, and member of 
the reserve service to foster patriotism and revolutionary 
heroism to a greater extent in themselves and conscientiously 
make their due contributions by discharging their sacred 
responsibility to protect state security and safeguard social 
stability and by providing a powerful security safeguard for the 
deepening of reform and economic development. 
  Compulsory military service is the main body of the 
military service system and is the basic military service system 
of our country. Firmly establishing an awareness in people's 
minds of the importance of performing military service and of 
executing their duties according to the law is the most 
fundamental prerequisite for enforcing the "Military Service 
Law." In the context of the development of a socialist market 
economy, it is of especially important significance to emphasize 
this issue. Only by being firmly duty-minded can one correctly 
understand and treat the adjustments to various interest 
patterns and interest relations caused by social changes, 
consistently put the country's security and state interests 
above everything else, and regard performing military service 
and executing one's duty according to the law as the most 
honorable sacred responsibility. Only with this can we 
effectively resist the influence of money worship and various 
erroneous ideologies and selflessly dedicate our youth and blood 
to the glorious positions of army building and protecting our 
motherland. Only with this can the broad ranks of militiamen 
and reserve service personnel seek prosperity while being 
vigilant against possible dangers, take an active part in 
military training, conscientiously perform various duties in 
preparation for war, truly become capable assistants to the 
People's Liberation Army and a strong reserve force, and give 
better play to their role as a mainstay force in promoting and 
protecting socialist modernization. 
  Since the "Military Service Law" was promulgated 10 years 
ago, local governments at all levels and the general public have 
done a great deal of fruitful work to strengthen the 
modernization of national defense and have created many 
favorable conditions for army building and the building of 
reserve defense forces for which we would like to express our 
deepest respect and gratitude. We are determined to do a better 
job in studying, propagating, and implementing the "Military 
Service Law" under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee 
and the Central Military Commission with Comrade Jiang Zemin as 
the core, and, together with the people of all nationalities in 
the country and under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, continue to 
make new contributions to speeding up the modernization of 
national defense.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yu Changhong (0060 7022 3163)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 3 Jun (XINHUA) -- What were China's 
environmental conditions like last year? The "Communique on 
China's Environmental Conditions" issued by the State 
Environmental Protection Bureau today says: Under the 
circumstances of a fairly rapid economic development in 1993, 
environmental conditions were relatively more stable. 
Environmental pollution and damage to the eco-environment were 
still continuing. A small number of areas were seriously 
polluted, whereas pollution in some areas was brought under 
control. The eco-environment was turning for the better. 
  According to the regulations of the "Environmental 
Protection 
Law of the People's Republic of China," the State Environmental 
Protection Bureau will issue a "communique on China's 
environmental conditions" for the previous year on the eve of 5 
June -- World Environment Day -- every year after 1990. Since 
the United Nations convened the Congress on Environment and 
Development, the Chinese Government has paid much more attention 
to coordinated development of the environment and the economy, 
adopted the strategies for sustained development, and put 
forward a series of countermeasures and measures on environment 
and development. Environmental conditions around the country 
are stable as a whole. 
  The communique issued today notes: Air pollution caused by 
smoke from burning coal is still very serious in cities -- it is 
more serious in winter and spring than in summer and fall, in 
north China than in south China, and in medium and big cities 
than in small towns. The discharge of sulfur dioxide and 
industrial dust has increased to some extent, and acid rain has 
been found in more cities than in the previous year. 
  In 1993, water pollution found in rivers around the country 
was a kind of organic pollution. Water quality in mainstreams 
was better than in tributaries, and rivers passing through 
cities were more seriously polluted. Over exploitation of 
underground water was rampant in cities, and the deterioration 
of the eco-environment of the fishing industry had not been 
brought under effective control yet. The degradation, 
desertification, and salinization of grasslands continued, and 
the volume of mature forest trees which could be logged was 
shrinking. 
  Concerning the work of environmental protection in 1993, 
local people's governments at all levels and various departments 
under the State Council have intensified their work and 
extensively launched inspections of the enforcement of the 
environmental protection law under the guidance of the CPC 
Central Committee and the State Council and have made 
achievements in preventing and controlling industrial pollution. 
The amount of smoke and dust released into the air in cities 
remained the same as in 1992. The water quality in mainstreams 
of big rivers, inland rivers, large-sized reservoirs, 
underground water in cities, and most offshore waters remained 
fine. Municipal and public facilities were further improved; 
progress was made in declaring and registering discharged 
pollutants; control over dumping at sea was further strengthened. 
  In 1993, people around the country have further enhanced 
their environmental concepts, and environmental campaigns with 
the participation of the public were larger and more diversified 
than in the past. Environmental education was more popularized. 
  The 1993 "Communique on China's Environmental Conditions" is 
jointly compiled and completed by the Ministry of Agriculture, 
Ministry of Forestry, Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry of 
Geology and Mineral Resources, Ministry of Construction, 
Ministry of Public Health, State Statistical Bureau, State 
Meteorological Administration, State Oceanography Bureau, State 
Land Administration Bureau, and State Environmental Protection 
Bureau.

  [Text] Beijing, June 6 (XINHUA) -- Ren Jianxin, a top 
Chinese judge, pledged today that China would severely crack 
down on embezzlers, bribe-taking officials, swindlers, smugglers 
and other serious economic offenders. 
  Addressing a national telephonic conference, Ren, president 
of the Supreme People's Court, said that spreading of corruption 
had been brought under control as a result of the anti-graft 
campaign nationwide. 
  During the first four months of 1994, procuratorates 
throughout China investigated 19,000 economic offence cases, 
including 12,000 cases of embezzlement and bribery, according to 
participants in the conference, held by the Central Political 
Science and Law Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. 
  During the first quarter of this year, courts at various 
levels tried 9,836 economic offence cases, including 2,591 cases 
involving at least 10,000 yuan each. 
  During that period, the courts sentenced 7,130 accused to 
various prison terms for economic offences, and 102 of them were 
sentenced either to death or life imprisonment. 
  The 7,130 accused included one vice-minister, nine at 
prefectural commissioner's level and 35 at county magistrate's 
level. 
  Ren Jianxin, who is also secretary of the Central Political 
Science and Law Committee, said that in the second half of 1994, 
law-enforcement departments must speed up investigations of 
major economic offences, with emphasis on embezzlers, 
bribe-taking officials, swindlers in the financial sector and 
smuggling. 
  "Leading departments of the party and government, judicial 
departments, law-enforcement administrative departments and 
economic administrative departments are the main targets," he 
told the conference. 
  He also said that when there were new major economic offence 
cases, especially ones involving leading officials, they would 
be made public.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by Zhong Min (6988 2404): "A Second </F>
Batch of Mainland Enterprises To Be Listed in the United States"] 
  [Text] Recently, the Beijing authorities named a second 
batch of 22 state-owned enterprises which have been given 
permission to seek listings abroad. While most of them will be 
listed in Hong Kong, five are heading toward the United States. 
The following enterprises are expected to go to the U.S. stock 
market one after another beginning in June: China Eastern 
Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Huaneng Electrical, Shandong 
Electric Power, and Tianjin Steel Tubes. They will make up the 
second batch of "mountain-climbing tigers on the U.S. stock 
market," following in the footsteps of Brilliance Automobile, 
Yichu Motorcycles, China Tire, and Shanghai Petrochemical, which 
were listed in the United States beginning in October 1992. 
  The term "mountain-climbing tigers on the U.S. stock market" 
was invented by some Wall Street stock brokers in New York, as 
mainland enterprises showed such a strong rising momentum soon 
after entering the United States. For instance, on the very day 
Shenyang Brilliance Automobile's shares pioneered on the New 
York stock market, investors vied with each other and bought 5 
million shares at the unit price of $16. By the time trading 
officially opened, the share price had gone up to $18, and, 
three weeks later, reached a high of $34. Another example was 
when China Tire landed on Wall Street, and it sold 6.1 million 
shares at a unit price of $17. A few days later, the price rose 
to $18.75, after which it fluctuated before going up to $27 last 
December, ranking among the 20 most active stocks in Wall 
Street. Also, Shanghai Petrochemical initially issued 18 
million shares at a price of $20.39, and, after some small drops 
and big rebounds, reached a record high of $49.2 per share 
toward the end of last year and became one of Wall Street's 
hottest stocks. 
  The strong recommendations given by several famous 
investment 
companies in the United States contributed to the popularity of 
mainland enterprises on the U.S. stock market. Before and after 
mainland shares were listed, 30 fund managers, led by Morgan 
Stanley, visited mainland China. On their return, most 
expressed optimism about the mainland's economic prospects. A 
senior executive of Wall Street's Peiji [1014 1015] Securities 
said: "From a long-term point of view, China's stocks have good 
prospects, because financiers and entrepreneurs in the United 
States and around the world are mostly optimistic about the 
Pacific rim economic zone with China at its center." Therefore, 
Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch [5019 2651], and Maibonshish [5019 
6721 2514 0823] all undertook to sell mainland stocks. 
  The second batch of five mainland enterprises are being 
listed in the United States with a view to raising over $3 
billion. Eastern Airlines plans to raise $1 billion to expand 
its fleet and obtain other supporting equipment and, at the same 
time, is taking advantage of this opportunity to draw on the 
management experience of international aviation companies. 
  In order to standardize the listing of mainland enterprises 
in the United States, the mainland's securities authority and 
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission signed a memorandum 
on joint monitoring in Beijing in late April this year, laying 
the foundation for bilateral cooperation in the securities 
industry. 
  It is reported that around the time this Sino-U.S. 
memorandum 
was signed, Britain's London Stock Exchange told Chinese 
diplomats: "We look forward to assisting Chinese enterprises in 
overseas listing." Exchanges in Japan and Singapore also 
expressed a wish to have Chinese enterprises listed on their 
markets. 
  At a "Fund-Raising by Chinese and Hong Kong Enterprises in 
the United States" seminar held in Hong Kong in mid May, Liu 
Hongru, chairman of the China Securities Supervision and 
Regulatory Commission, said: The U.S. market is the biggest 
international capital market and has the largest transaction 
volume and highest mobility of all the stock markets worldwide. 
It is under strict supervision and management and its 
well-developed laws and regulations and full protection for 
investors give it appeal to many investors. Therefore, we have 
made an initial decision that five of the 22 Chinese enterprises 
in the second batch to be listed overseas will go directly to 
the United States to issue shares and seek listings on a trial 
basis. This is not only an expansion of the financial market 
open to Chinese enterprises, but is also a further development 
of economic reform in greater depth. 
  Liu Hongru also said: The success of Chinese enterprises 
issuing H shares in Hong Kong has not only opened up a new 
channel for fund-raising, but, more importantly, has indicated 
that Chinese enterprises are able to strictly abide by the laws, 
regulations, accounting systems, disclosures, and other 
requirements of international markets and meet standards set by 
international markets on share issues and enterprise listings. 
Entering the large and strictly controlled U.S. capital market 
will help improve the reputation of Chinese enterprises in 
international markets.

<F P=106> [By reporters Qu Zhihong (2575 1807 4767) and Guo Xiaolan </F>
(6753 1420 5695)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 6 Jun (XINHUA) -- Despite being a late 
beginner, China is making rapid progress in developing copyright 
protection undertakings. Within three years, China has not only 
set up a fairly complete copyright protection system in the 
country, but also has taken a giant step into the big 
international family of copyrights and achieved the link-up of 
domestic copyright protection system with international ones. A 
young and modernized copyright protection system has basically 
been set up in China. 
  As the spring tide of reform and opening up rose, China 
began 
building its copyright protection system from naught. In 1979, 
the drafting of the "PRC Copyright Law" began and over repeated 
discussions and revisions, New China's first "Copyright Law" was 
adopted at the 15th Session of the Standing Committee of the 
Seventh National People's Congress [NPC] in 1990, and officially 
took effect in June 1991. Meanwhile, the "Regulations for the 
Implementation of the PRC Copyright Law" and the "Regulations on 
Computer Software Protection" were promulgated one after 
another; China's copyright protection legislation had taken 
shape. 
  This significant progress in the field of intellectual 
property right protection aroused enthusiastic responses from 
various social circles, and the Chinese intelligentsia were 
particularly elated. 
  In fact, as a world-acknowledged high-level "Copyright Law," 
the law has not only reaped the rewards it deserves, but has 
also offered an overall legal protection to copyright holders 
through various levels. Over the past three years, courts 
around China have accepted over 500 copyright-related cases. 
More and more people engaged in literature, arts, and science 
and technology are walking to the solemn court with perfect 
assurance to declare war against the infringements on their 
signatory rights, rights to preserve the integrity of, and 
rights to use their works. 
  Over three years of practice has proven that the enforcement 
of the "Copyright Law" has not only offered a legal basis for 
the protection of undertakings in literature, arts, and science 
and technology in China, which then greatly inspires the 
enthusiasm of people creating such works and directly promotes 
the development of spiritual and material civilization, but has 
also shown the whole society its respect for knowledge, creative 
works, and human dignity. Many experts believed that this would 
be of profound influence on the long-term development and 
progress of Chinese society. 
  While establishing and improving the domestic copyright 
protection system, China also actively promoted the progress of 
joining the international copyright protection system. As early 
as the beginning of the drafting of the "Copyright Law," China 
had been paying great attention to absorbing the experiences and 
strong points of international copyright circles, and had been 
fully aware of the requirements of the international copyright 
convention, so as to make corresponding preparations for joining 
international copyright organizations. On 1 July 1992, the NPC 
Standing Committee made a decision on joining the Berne 
Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and 
the Universal Copyright Convention; on 7 November, it made the 
decision to join the "Sound-Recorded Products Convention." In 
October 1992 and April 1993, the three international copyright 
conventions took effect in China successively. Thus, China has 
become a member of major international conventions on copyright 
and relevant rights, set up relations with over 100 countries 
for mutual copyright protection, and basically normalized 
relations with foreign countries in copyright. It can be said 
that within a couple of years, China has walked a path that took 
many countries decades or even more than a century to walk. 
  China's rapid advances in the work of copyright protection 
have drawn attention from the international community. Bogsch, 
director-general of the World Intellectual Property 
Organization, termed China's accession to the Berne Convention 
"an important historic achievement" and "a tremendous success of 
the international copyright circles" and China. He maintained 
that this would be a significant matter to the Chinese culture, 
science and technology, and social development, as well as to 
the entire international community.

<F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Zou Qingli (6760 3237 7787): "Increase </F>
All People's Awareness of Paying Taxes"; from the special column 
"Taxes Are Everyone's Concern"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 24 Apr (XINHUA) -- XINHUA editor's note: 
As China introduced a new taxation system at the beginning of 
this year, strengthening the collection and management of taxes 
has become a task of top priority, while the collection of taxes 
has demanded the entire society's understanding and support. In 
order to enhance understanding and communicate with the entire 
society on issues related to taxes, XINHUA will, beginning 
today, introduce a new special column, "Taxes Are Everyone's 
Concern." The column will carry reports on outstanding 
taxpayers and the role of tax revenues in the national economy, 
as well as tax evasion cases of individual taxpayers. (End of 
editor's note) 
  Along with economic and social development, more and more 
people have somehow begun to understand what taxes are. Often 
they are most aware of the need to pay individual income tax 
when an individual's income reaches a certain level. The 
salaried working stratum, those with an 800 yuan or more monthly 
income are, after all, very few. Therefore, some people are 
"indifferent" toward this tax category, which should be of 
obvious concern to the people's livelihood, and may know even 
less with regard to other kinds of taxes. 
  As a matter of fact, the moment one becomes a member of 
society, taxes will accompany him or her for the rest of their 
life. We must arouse all people's awareness to pay taxes! 
<H5>  I </H5>
  In a civilized society, each and every individual is bound 
to 
play two roles, i.e., as a laborer and a consumer. As a 
laborer, one creates social wealth, part of which is delivered 
by the enterprise or work unit to the state in the form of 
taxes. As a consumer, one buys goods, which include costs and 
profits, in addition to taxes. All taxes paid are like tiny 
streams which form an enormous river to replenish the state 
treasury and build the mansion of the Republic. 
  Taxes concern everyone in a thousand and one ways. An 
individual is a citizen as well as a taxpayer who fulfills, 
consciously or unconsciously, the duty of paying taxes, while 
enjoying, tangibly or intangibly, the benefits of taxes he or 
she has paid. When one buys a pack of quality cigarettes, he or 
she pays taxes with 60 percent of the purchase money; by the 
same token, 20 percent of the money paid for a color TV set 
actually goes to taxes. Meanwhile, when one walks on a 
boulevard and breathes the fresh air purified by the green 
invested by society, he or she is enjoying the benefits brought 
about by the taxes he or she has paid. 
  Macroscopically, taxes are revenues obtained from society by 
the state in order to perform its functions. In 1993, the state 
revenues totaled some 511 billion yuan, of which 400 billion 
yuan, or nearly 80 percent of the total, was derived from 
various taxes, while 95 percent of Beijing municipality's income 
derived from tax revenues. Tax revenues, which come from the 
people and are spent on them, keep the giant state apparatus in 
operation, safeguard national security, and maintain social 
stability, peace, and order. Microscopically, taxes paid by an 
individual to the state in various forms are repaid to him or 
her by the state accordingly through educational, health, 
cultural, recreational, and other services; through roads, 
communications, and other infrastructure invested in and built 
by the state for production and everyday needs; and through 
various direct and indirect state subsidies and benefits. 
  Taxes paid by each and every individual lump together and, 
under unified state plans, create a more convenient and 
comfortable living environment for all of us. 
  II 
  Prior to reform and opening up, China implemented a policy 
of 
unified financial receipts and allocations by the state. 
Moreover, as tax revenues had no direct bearing on the 
interests of units or individuals, the overwhelming majority of 
people knew only vaguely "the need to pay taxes by everyone," a 
concept rather prevalent in Western developed countries. Most 
industrial workers were not aware of taxes, and farmers selling 
hogs were confused about the need to pay animal slaughter tax; 
while plant directors and managers generally complained about 
excessive taxes, and individual business operators grumbled at 
heavy taxes. Hence, when encountered by tax collectors, 
taxpayers often bargained or went into hiding. 
  While tax awareness is rather weak among a segment of the 
population, some individuals have a strong "intention" to evade 
taxes. Some individual industrial and commercial units operated 
without a license, wrote unauthorized receipts, or printed 
receipts without permission in order to evade taxes. According 
to rough estimation, taxes unlawfully retained by individual 
business operators last year amounted to 26 billion yuan. Some 
state- and collectively-owned enterprises took the opportunity 
of signing contracts to inflate costs and delay tax payments, or 
evaded taxes by hiding and underreporting their business volume. 
As of the end of last June, taxes in arrears by enterprises 
alone totaled 10.9 billion yuan. Some popular singers, dancers, 
and movie stars, while receiving high remuneration for their 
performances, have no intention whatsoever of paying individual 
income taxes. "Whoever wants to make a fortune must live on tax 
loopholes" has become a slogan for some people wanting to get 
rich. 
  A new type of criminal has emerged in society following the 
state taxation and foreign trade reform -- tax swindlers. 
Colluding with some culprits outside Chinese territory, they 
unscrupulously swindle huge amounts of state export tax refunds. 
In the first eight months of 1993, the procuratorial organs at 
various levels in China prosecuted 25 tax swindle cases 
involving some 110 people, uncovered six criminal gangs, 
arrested 45 criminal offenders of all kinds, and confiscated 3.5 
billion yuan in fake receipts used by criminals. These lawless 
elements swindled more than 100 million yuan in export tax 
refunds from the state. 
  Huge fortunes that were supposed to go to the state 
coffers were lost like this. 
  It has been learned that an alarming amount of tax receipts 
that were supposed to go to the state coffers were illegally 
retained and became lost. According to a rough estimate, tax 
receipts lost annually in this way amount to at least 100 
billion yuan, an amount that is more than the total annual 
revenues of treasuries at the county level, more than the total 
annual state power expense, or enough to pay for 80 Yanpu 
bridges, five Beijing-Kowloon Railways, or two Three-Gorge 
projects... [ellipsis as published] 
  The huge amounts of lost tax receipts reflect an irrational 
distribution policy. While dodging tax, individually-owned 
businesses enjoy the economic environment and all sorts of 
conveniences provided by the state. Managers of some large 
enterprises who default on paying tax on the one hand take 
advantage of the spacious quarters subsidized by the state on 
the other. A few TV and movie personalities who evade tax have 
no qualms whatsoever about drawing all sorts of benefits and 
subsidies. 
  Evading tax is like cutting out a piece of the 
collectively-owned fortune created by all of us. Not satisfied 
with that, the tax evaders also want a share of what is left. 
This kind of behavior should be condemned by the whole of 
society, and it is certainly within the power of the state to 
punish them. 
  One heartening development is that conscientiously paying 
one's tax has become a civilized conduct in the minds of many 
people. Self-employed businessmen in Guangdong have become 
noticeably more willing to pay tax. They paid a total of 3.1 
billion yuan in tax from January to October last year. In 
Beijing, self-employed people have been sighted forming long 
queues waiting to pay tax. Things have also improved with 
regard to tax evasion by entertainers, which had aroused bitter 
complaints among the masses. Mandatory tax collection in 
accordance with law is being closely integrated with enhanced 
public awareness of paying tax according to law, and this 
development has helped advance China's tax collection work. 
<H5>  III </H5>
  Collecting money for the state -- this is the heavy 
responsibility on the shoulders of tax collectors. 
  China's taxation departments have 600,000 cadres, staff 
members, and other employees whose job is to collect 350 to 400 
billion yuan yearly in assorted taxes from the nation's 30 
million businesses and individual taxpayers. Some taxpayers are 
"watermelons" and some are "sesame seeds." A large enterprise 
may pay tens, even hundreds, upon millions of yuan in tax a 
year. "Sesame seeds," which each pay a relatively paltry sum, 
eventually result in huge amounts of taxes collected. The 
smallest tax bill for small taxpayers could be as little as a 
few cents. As the watermelons cannot be overlooked, so every 
sesame seed should also be picked up. From the bustling city to 
the remote countryside, the broad ranks of tax collectors have 
to "trek across mountains and rivers, make house calls to 
thousands upon thousands of households, talk themselves hoarse, 
and endure hardships of every description" to collect the 
fortune for the state cent by cent. 
  Sometimes they have to travel up hill and down dale for 
hours 
to collect a few cents of tax. To collect tax according to law, 
sometimes they have to endure, in addition to hardships, all 
sorts of grievances, and even face the test of life or death. 
  In Zhushan County, Hubei, special tax officer Fan Quanhe 
died 
an honorable death when he -- while carry out his official 
duties -- was stabbed in the heart by a tax evader armed with a 
butcher's knife. Soon afterward, tax collector Zheng Xinhua in 
Pujiang County, Zhejiang, was killed instantly when he was 
pushed down from a moving car while he was searching for 
smuggled cigarettes... [ellipsis as published] According to 
figures compiled by the State Administration of Taxation, there 
were 16,920 cases of violence involving tax evasion from 1987 to 
1992. Of the 14,298 cases involving physical abuse of tax 
collectors, 1,963 persons became permanently disabled as a 
result of severe wounds, and two were killed. 
  China today is short of 300,000 tax collectors. Many of the 
30,000 or more grass-roots tax offices in cities and villages 
all over the country do not have a suitable office. Tax 
collectors do not have superior means of transportation and 
communications. Tax collectors riding on bicycles often have to 
tail tax evaders riding motorcycles or driving automobiles... 
[ellipsis as published] In spite of this, the republic's tax 
collectors stand fast at their posts and dedicate themselves to 
tax collection. Beijing city alone has 7,000 tax collectors who 
collect 18 billion yuan in tax annually, averaging 2.5 million 
yuan per tax collector. Since 1990, the national tax receipts 
have grown at an average annual rate of over 10 percent, topping 
400 billion yuan in 1993. With their services, they have made 
major contributions in exercising macroeconomic regulation and 
control, and in safeguarding the national interest.

  [Text] Shanghai, 6 Jun (XINHUA) -- While experiencing a 
great margin of economic growth last year, Shanghai city 
witnessed a remarkable drop in discharges of industrial waste 
water and waste gases. However, the city's solid waste 
discharge increased in 1993. These are facts revealed in the 
"1993 Communique on Shanghai City's Environmental Situation" 
recently released by the Shanghai Municipal Environmental 
Protection Bureau. 
  The communique says that the Shanghai GNP reached 51 billion 
yuan in 1993, an increase of 14.9 percent over the 1992. Its 
industrial growth was 16.8 percent in 1993. Meanwhile, 
Shanghai's annual industrial waste water discharge was 1.28 
billion tons in 1993, a drop of 6.5 percent from the 1992 
record. The volume of industrial waste water treated in 1993 
reached 1.09 billion tons, representing an increase of 5.5 
percent over 1992. The discharges of major pollutants in 
industrial waste water witnessed a drop in 1993 from the 1992 
record. Last year, the city consumed 32.736 million tons of 
coal, a slight increase over 1992. In 1993, Shanghai's total 
discharge of waste gases amounted to 423.05 billion cubic 
meters, including 385.92 billion cubic meters of industrial 
waste gases, representing a drop of 17.2 percent and 12.6 
percent respectively from the 1992 record. The discharges of 
major pollutants in waste gases decreased to various extents, as 
compared with 1992. Industrial solid wastes increased by 4.9 
percent over 1992, reaching 11.98 million tons. 
  In terms of Shanghai's environmental quality in 1993, the 
communique has the following overall evaluation: The quality of 
water and air is better than 1993 but there is little progress 
in reducing noise.

<F P=106> [By reporter Chen Bingguang (7115 3521 0342)] </F>
  [Text] Guangzhou, 7 Jun (XINHUA) -- The Nanhai West Oil 
Corporation of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation 
[CNOOC] has adopted a two-pronged operations principle: 
strengthening foreign cooperation as well as raising funds and 
carrying out exploration and development on its own. It has 
made significant progress in developing the vast natural gas 
reserves in the western part of the South China Sea. 
Development and construction is being undertaken simultaneously 
offshore and on land, with well-drilling ships working day and 
night on the vast Beibuwan waters, a region that has become a 
principal battleground for China's natural gas exploration and 
development. 
  Repeated evidence from Chinese and foreign experts indicate 
rich natural gas resources in Yingge Hai and Hainan's southeast 
basin, with reserves reaching 1.344 billion [as received] cubic 
meters [cu m], or about one-third of China's total natural gas 
resources. Of this total, about 2.5-3 trillion [as received] cu 
m are resources with economic value. The development of this 
vast natural gas reserves area is significant to altering the 
energy structure and alleviating energy shortages in the south 
as well as quickening economic construction in the southeast 
coastal regions. 
  Since reform and opening up, the Nanhai West Oil Corporation 
of the CNOOC has signed 21 contracts and agreements with 26 oil 
companies from 10 countries to utilize foreign funds and 
advanced technology and equipment, thereby quickening the pace 
of exploring offshore oil and natural gas fields. By the end of 
last year, $956 million had been utilized. Meanwhile, through 
foreign cooperation, the company has trained a group of 
scientific and technological teams capable of exploring and 
developing offshore oil and natural gas fields independently in 
line with international practice and standards. 
  The new discovery of natural gas reserves in the western 
part 
of the southern sea has interested many foreign oil companies. 
Since 1992, the corporation has signed five new contracts with 
ARCO Corporation, Crestone Corporation, and Esso Corporation of 
the United States to explore natural gas fields. While 
quickening exploration in the vast natural gas reserves region, 
China is now carrying out large-scale development and 
construction of the vast Ya 13-1 natural gas field project with 
ARCO Corporation and Kuwait Foreign Oil Exploration Corporation, 
with a total investment of $1.16 billion. According to the 
agreement, 2.9 billion cu m of natural gas will be supplied to 
Hong Kong annually via submarine pipelines for 20 years 
beginning 1 January 1996, while 500 million cu m of natural gas 
will be supplied to Hainan Province annually. 
  Since the beginning of this year, operating contractors 
formed by Italy's (Shipeng) Ocean Engineering Corporation and 
the European Ocean Engineering Transnational Corporation used an 
advanced submarine-pipe-laying ship to lay over 700 km of 28-in 
diameter submarine pipelines from the Zhu Jiang estuary to 
Yingge Hai, and plan to complete the laying of over 70 km of 
submarine pipeline from the Zhu Jiang estuary to Hong Kong's 
receiving port in August. The 800-km long trunk pipeline is 
Asia's longest submarine gas pipeline. Further, the construction 
of a 14-in, 100-km submarine gas pipeline from the platform at 
Yingge Hai to Hainan's Sanya City began at the beginning of this 
month. 
  According to plans, reserves of 550-700 billion cu m of 
natural gas and 240 million tonnes of crude oil will be added in 
the vast natural gas reserves area in 15 years. By the end of 
this century, an annual production capability for 10 billion cu 
m of natural gas and 1 million tonnes of crude oil will be 
developed.

  [Text] Beijing, June 6 (XINHUA) -- The emphasis which China 
has placed on saving water-use in the cities had had good 
effects, said Ye Rutang, vice-minister of construction. 
  Since 1983, Chinese cities have saved using 13.9 billion 
cubic meters of water altogether. The ratio of recycled water 
used has increased from less than 20 percent in 1983 to 60 
percent. 
  China economizes to save using 1.39 billion cubic meters of 
water annually, equal to building seven water-works with a 
capacity of 500,000 cubic meters. 
  Economizing on water obviously helps to protect China's 
water 
resources and city environments, he pointed out. 
  Waste water which had to be disposed of has decreased by 1.1 
billion cubic meters every year through the save-water drive. 
  Shanghai, Tianjin, Ningbo and other cities have improved 
their control of earth subsidence by stronger management of 
utilization of ground-water resources. 
  China also saves 6.95 billion kwh of electricity every year 
by cutting water-use, Ye said. 
  China has 2,800 billion cubic meters of water resources, the 
sixth greatest in the world. But each Chinese citizen only has 
2,440 cubic meters, a quarter of the world average, due to 
China's large population of more than 1.1 billion. 
  Figures from the provinces so far available in Beijing show 
that by the end of 1993, there was water shortage in about 300 
cities out of China's total of 570 cities. 
  To make people conscious of the importance of keeping 
water-use down, China has set aside the second week in June 
every year as a period for special publicity on saving water, ye 
said. 
  He added that the government has set up a special 
organization in the Ministry of Construction and branches in 
most of the cities to coordinate water-saving efforts.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yonghong: "Fresh Push To Stabilize Barren Soil With </F>
Trees] 
  [Text] The country's top forestry official has vowed to 
step up the ongoing afforestation drive to help improve the 
nation's ecological balance. 
  "Efforts will be made to speed up all major tree-planting 
projects to meet planned targets one or two years ahead of 
schedule, to cope with the country's brisk development," 
Vice-Minister of Forestry Zhu Guangyao told reporters over the 
weekend. 
  China ranks number one in the world for its dramatic growth 
of forest resources in the past decade, but more efforts are 
needed to make the land greener, said Zhu. 
  Planting trees on now-barren hills will be a priority goal 
for the rest of the century, the vice-minister said in an 
interview. 
  The city of Tianjin, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and 
Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Shandong, Jilin and Zhejiang Provinces 
plan afforestation for all of their barren hills that are 
suitable for tree-growing this year, according to Zhu. 
  Two-thirds of China's provinces, municipalities, and 
autonomous regions are expected to achieve their targets by the 
year 2000, when the national forest coverage will rise to at 
least 15.3 percent from the current 13.9 percent, Zhu said. 
  Every year, some 5.4 million hectares of trees are planted 
across the country. Nature reserves now account for 6.8 percent 
of the country's total area. 
  Despite the marked progress in the past decade, China still 
faces some serious environmental and ecological problems. The 
degradation, desertification, and salinization of farmland and 
grassland are continuing, while soil erosion remains serious, he 
added. 
  Ecological deterioration has worsened living conditions and 
severely hindered economic development. The ecological damage 
to agricultural production is an especially hard blow since 
China must feed its 1.2 billion population, or 20 percent of the 
world's total, with only 7 percent of world's cultivated land. 
  Over 15 per cent of China's land suffers from soil erosion 
and 5 billion tons of soil are washed away annually, Zhu noted. 
  Desert acreage is expanding by 2,100 square kilometres 
annually and has now reached 1.53 million square kilometres, or 
15.9 percent of the territory. 
  Eroded areas are particularly vulnerable to further 
environmental damage from severe weather such as droughts 
floods, hailstorms, and unseasonably hot or cold weather. 
  "All these natural disasters can be alleviated or put under 
control with more forest coverage," the vice-minister stressed. ; 
  Since the late 1970's, the country has launched seven 
ambitious afforestation and ecological improvement projects. 
  Nearly all areas afflicted by ecological damage have been 
targeted by those projects, which cover 5.8 million square 
kilometres or 60 percent of the country's territory, Zhu 
explained. 
  So far, a total of 24.2 million hectares of forests have 
been 
planted. 
  Tree zones are being created along the upper and middle 
reaches of the Yangtze River, along the coast, on the plains, 
and in the Taihang Mountain region. And work on the Three North 
shelter belt, stretching from the northeast, across the north to 
the northwest, will continue until 2050 to become the world's 
largest such tree zone. 
  When all the projects are completed, some 66.7 million 
hectares, or over two-thirds of all farmland will have more 
effective ecological protection.

  [Text] Shenzhen, June 6 (XINHUA) -- A factory building 
collapsed on Saturday [4 June] in a village in Longgang Town at 
Shenzhen, killing 11 people and seriously injuring nine who were 
all living in this unfinished construction. 
  Investigations so far indicate that the building was put up 
in breach of various regulations. 
  The building belongs to a plastics factory, in which the 
investor is a Hong Kong businessman named Wang Chengen. The 
firm is said to have hired an unregistered construction team. 
  The construction of the building was not given official 
approval. It did not have the necessary certificate for a new 
building. No geological survey was done. There were no proper 
architectural drawings, either, officials said. 
  It was jerry-built and the building materials and 
construction quality were very poor. Before the building was 
finished, when the third, fourth and fifth floors were still 
incomplete, the company had arranged for 106 of its workforce to 
live on the second floor. 
  When the accident happened, all the people living on that 
floor, except 32 who had gone out for early morning outdoor 
exercises, were trapped in the building. 
  The labor contractor of the building and a factory manager 
in 
charge of daily business were detained for further 
investigation. The detained person named Wang Ruipei is a 
younger brother of Wang Chengen. 
  The local procuratorate is investigating the accident.

  [Text] Haikou, June 7 (XINHUA) -- It's not personality but 
performance which will have the final say in the appointment or 
removal of managers or directors of state-owned enterprises in 
Hainan Province, China's largest special economic zone. 
  As a major step toward introducing a modern enterprise 
management mechanism, the province drafted stipulations for the 
appointment of state-owned enterprise managers or directors this 
April. 
  According to the stipulations, no one may be reappointed 
within five years after serving prison terms or being deprived 
of their political rights for economic crimes; within three 
years after clearing debts following management of enterprises 
which went bankrupt owing to poor performance; or for not paying 
off debts on due dates. 
  Hainan tried the appointment system for managers and 
directors in the state-owned enterprises before. However, as 
there were no official rules for it, often managers who had been 
removed due to poor performance were appointed again to similar 
or higher positions. 
  The new appointment system declares that a public debate 
attended by workers' representatives must be held for managerial 
candidates. A public survey must also be conducted among 
employees to test workers' trust in their candidates. The move, 
along with other regulations, has cleared the way for an 
effective appointment system for the province's management 
personnel.

  [Excerpts] When going down to the state-owned enterprises 
and the rural areas of the Xianning Prefecture to conduct 
investigation and study from 22 to 29 May, Governor Jia Zhijie 
pointed out that all localities and departments should: 
Implement the policies given to the province by the central 
authorities in a satisfactory, full, and creative way; carry out 
economic work in a thoroughgoing, careful, and solid manner; 
strive to concentrate efforts in agriculture on implementing 
policies and paying close attention to the construction of the 
"rice bag" and "shopping basket" projects; make great efforts in 
industry to tackle difficult problems and raise efficiency by 
centering around the market; properly solve the pronounced 
contradictions and problems in economic life; and should 
continue to maintain and develop the current fine situation. 
[passage omitted] 
  Jia Zhijie maintained that our province's current situation 
can be summarized in three sentences: First, the situation is 
unprecedented and fine rather than generally good. The main 
indications are that the enthusiasm of the broad masses of 
peasants for production is unprecedentedly high and a momentum 
of breakthrough development has been maintained in grain and 
cotton production and the development of a diversified economy 
and township and town enterprises. A historic, great turn has 
occurred in the development of industry, which has maintained a 
relatively high growth rate, some state-owned enterprises have 
managed to get, or are getting, themselves out of their 
predicaments, and the industrial output in April increased by 
12.2 percent over the same month last year, higher than the 5 
percent for the nation's state- owned enterprises in the same 
month. Urban and rural markets are brisk and reforms in 
macromanagement structures, such as finance, banking, 
investment, and planning, have been progressing smoothly. 
Experiments in building a modern enterprise system are being 
carried out step by step and opening up to the outside world 
continues to maintain a good momentum. Second, is that in the 
fine situation, there are really some difficulties and problems 
hampering development and stability, which should not be 
overlooked, and we should earnestly approach and properly solve 
them. Third is that only when these difficulties and problems 
in our advance are properly solved can our province's fine 
situation, which has not come easily, be maintained and 
developed. [passage omitted] 
  Jia Zhijie pointed out: It is necessary to correctly handle 
the relationship between reform, development, and stability, 
further remove hidden dangers, and maintain social stability. 
He said: What counts in solving the problem of stability is 
taking a two-handed approach: Take radical measures while 
putting stress on taking precautions. At present we should make 
great efforts to do the work well in the following ways: Firmly 
putting price raises below the nation's average levels; doing 
well from start to finish in improving the lives of the people 
in disaster areas, areas around reservoirs, and poverty-stricken 
areas, ensuring that they have enough food to eat and their 
temporary shortages are smoothly overcome; doing an earnest job 
of finding jobs for cadres and employees whose employment has 
been affected as a result of reform; encouraging the companies 
which were affected by reform to find a way out by increasing 
income and decreasing expenditure, readjusting the 
organizational structure, and cutting unreasonable spending, and 
continuing to improve the basic daily necessities of the 
enterprises which have suspended production totally or partially 
and help some university and college students solve their 
difficulties in their daily lives. 
  He urged all localities to pay close attention to the 
development of the "rice bag" and "shopping basket" projects, 
strive for innovative advances in developing a diversified 
economy and township and town enterprises, and do an ever better 
job in rural work. He pointed out: Our province's guidelines 
for rural work are clear and definite. At present, all 
localities should seize the favorable opportunity, further 
implement the central authorities' and the province's various 
preferential policies in support of agriculture, effectively 
reduce the peasants' burdens, adopt effective measures to check 
the excessively rapid momentum of price raises in capital goods 
for agriculture, protect the peasants' immediate interests, 
further mobilize their enthusiasm for production, ensure 
effective supplies, and lay a solid material foundation for 
stabilizing the market and commodity prices. [passage omitted] 
  While talking about running state-owned enterprises well and 
maintaining the good momentum of industrial production, Jia 
Zhijie pointed out: It is necessary to take measures to tackle 
difficult problems and increase efficiency. [passage omitted] 
All localities should give first consideration to and study the 
market while helping the enterprises which have suspended 
production totally or partially recovered production, by 
deciding projects to launch, making decisions, and readjusting 
the product mix and the enterprise organizational structure. 
The fundamental way for enterprises to meet market demand is to 
enable them to get involved in the market and strive to pump 
fresh vitality into state-owned enterprises by deepening reform, 
changing operational mechanisms, and establishing a modern 
enterprise system. 
  Jia Zhijie stressed: To handle the relationship between 
reform, development, and stability and maintain and develop the 
fine situation, which did not come easily; party committees and 
governments at all levels and various departments should further 
change their work style and develop the good work style of being 
practical and doing a solid job. What counts in doing this is 
that leaders should set an example. Principal party and 
government leaders at all levels must: Take the lead in cutting 
the excessive number of document meetings and having less social 
intercourse; be determined to go deep into the realities of 
life; go down to the grass-roots units, enterprises, and the 
rural areas by centering around the outstanding problems in 
reform, development, and stability; do more investigation and 
study; make great efforts to carry out their work; and solve 
practical problems.

  [Text] Shanghai, 6 Jun (XINHUA) -- Shanghai achieved a 
satisfactory result in its imports and exports this year. In 
the January-May period, Shanghai exported $3.244 billion worth 
of goods, an increase of 26 percent over the same period last 
year. Shanghai's imports increased simultaneously. 
  The Shanghai municipal government readjusted its strategy 
for 
promoting foreign trade last year. The move, including the 
organization of large foreign export companies, has facilitated 
the formation of many great exporting armies, brought the role 
of Shanghai as a trading port into full play, linked Shanghai 
with export enterprises across the country, encouraged export 
enterprises to directly participate in international market 
competition, and developed technological and service trade. 
  At present, there are more than 10,000 export enterprises in 
Shanghai, which make up six great exporting armies -- foreign 
trade, industrial trade, local trade, self-run export 
enterprises, the three kinds of enterprises that are either 
partially or wholly foreign-owned, and enterprises run by the 
central authorities in Shanghai. Since the beginning of this 
year, all of them have experienced an increase in exports. 
  About 460 overseas enterprises set up by Shanghai's 
companies 
in 60 or more countries and regions have begun to play an 
important role in foreign trade. They have helped increase 
export earnings. In addition, by providing an international 
sales network for Shanghai's enterprises, they have enabled a 
large amount of commodities to be exported to other countries in 
the world.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 7 (XINHUA) -- A school was 
inaugurated here today for migrant laborers. 
  Co-funded by Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, East China 
Teachers' University, and Shanghai Textile Workers' Trade Union, 
the school will educate migrant farm laborers in the city and 
aims to set up branch school in some districts and counties. 
  The municipal public security bureau says the city now has 
nearly a million farm laborers, who work for the city's 
building, municipal engineering and textile industry. 
  Almost all the building workers in this city are migrant 
laborers and 40 percent of the textile workers are girls and 
women from the countryside. 
  But the cultural and technological levels of these migrant 
laborers are comparatively lower than the urban residents, and 
many of them are illiterate or half-illiterate. Many also lack 
consciousness of safety and quality standards. 
  So the school will give lessons on public order, laws, 
morals, techniques and culture to these people from the 
countryside in their spare time. The text books have been 
written by East China Teachers' College.

  [Excerpts] Another mainland China passenger plane was 
hijacked to Taiwan this evening. The Boeing 737 Southern 
Airlines passenger plane, No. B2542, landed at the Chiang 
Kai-shek airport at 1156 GMT under escort by our Air Force 
aircraft. There were 131 passengers and eight crew members on 
board the plane, which was on a scheduled flight from Fuzhou to 
Guangzhou. . 
  According to preliminary reports, the plane was hijacked by 
a 36-year-old man (Chou Wen-chiang), using a carving knife and a 
flash light. The airport police have taken him from the plane 
for investigation. It was initially determined that there were 
no accomplices. 
  During the interrogation, (Chou Wen-chiang) said he was born 
in [words indistinct] in 1958 and was a resident of Guangdong's 
Lien County. He has a heart ailment [words indistinct]. He 
said he hijacked the plane because he was dissatisfied with his 
low pay of only a few dozen yuan a month, and he received a 
compensation of only 8,000 yuan after his elder sister was 
killed by an unlicensed driver. 
  According to the Ministry of Defense spokesman, the plane, 
which was hijacked at 1920, gave the signal at 1924 that it had 
been hijacked. While our military and radar placed the plane 
under close surveillance, two F5-E fighter jets took off from 
the Chiayi Airport to intercept it. The fighters intercepted 
the plane at 1939 and guided it to a safe landing at the Chiang 
Kai-shek Airport at 1956. 
  President Li Teng-hui and other ranking government 
officials, 
upon learning the news at a return banquet given by [words 
indistinct] president at the Grand Hotel, immediately instructed 
units concerned to handle the case according to established 
procedures. 
  Meanwhile, Minister Wu Po-hsiung, chairman of the Executive 
Yuan panel in charge of affairs about hijacking, indicated that 
the case will be handled according to the principle that the 
hijacker and the plane will be handled separately. He said the 
plane, after being routinely checked, will be allowed to fly to 
its original destination, but the hijacker will be turned over 
to judicial authorities for handling. He reiterated that while 
the government is firmly against any plane hijacking and will 
strictly punish any hijackers, relevant Chinese communist 
authorities should strengthen their security checks to forestall 
any hijacking attempts. He added that the hijacker will be 
repatriated after the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] has 
consultated the Association of Relations Across the Taiwan 
Straits [ARATS] and reached a common understanding with the 
latter. He said the hijacker will never be be allowed to stay 
in Taiwan. 
  As usual, the SEF has immediately notified ARATS on the 
procedures that will be taken for the repatriation of the 
hijacker. [passage omitted]

Tupolev-154 they were aboard crashed eight minutes after taking 
off from Xian on a domestic flight to the southeastern Province

  The Taipei Association of Travel Agents, after contacting 
mainland tourist authorities, identified the Taiwan tourist as 
Chuang Yao-tsung, 38. No further information about Chuang was 
available. 
  According to foreign wire service reports, government 
workers 
in Changan County, where the plane went down, reported that the 
China Northwest Airlines plane was racked by an explosion before 
it crashed. 
  The international airline passenger association earlier this 
year rated Mainland China as one of the most dangerous places to 
fly in the wake of the five crashes [words indistinct] last year 
that killed 76 people.

  [Text] Taipei, June 6 (CNA) -- Liang Kuo-shu, the newly 
installed governor of the Central Bank of China, said Monday [6 
Jun] that he is confident Taipei can become a financial hub of 
the Asia-Pacific region. 
  In aiming for that goal, which is one of the CBC's top 
priorities, the bank first wants to see Taipei become a regional 
funding center -- a source of capital for financial institutions 
and private enterprises both at home and abroad, Liang said when 
answering questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting. 
  In an effort to further open a [words indistinct] speed up 
the development of the local financial services market, the 
Ministry of Finance recently lifted restrictions on foreign 
investment on the local banking market, allowing foreigners and 
Overseas Chinese greater access in opening new banks and 
expanding operations here. 
  Liang said more financial instruments and better services 
would result because of the new policy, and added that so far, 
38 domestic and foreign banks have been allowed by the CBC to 
take part in offshore banking operations here. 
  Aiming to avert possible speculation on the local stock and 
foreign exchange markets brought about by huge foreign capital 
inflows, the CBC will use the foreign capital to meet the need 
of the manufacturing sector for its medium and long-term 
development, which plays an indispensable and vital role in the 
nation's economic growth, Liang said.

<F P=106> [By Y. C. Tsai] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, June 6 (CNA) -- The Taiwan economy is 
expected to continue its modest growth in the second half of 
1994, the First Commercial Bank reported Monday [6 Jun]. 
  In its report on domestic economic outlook for the next six 
months, the bank said the domestic economy will benefit from the 
gradual recovery of the global economy, the depreciation of the 
new Taiwan dollar, the ongoing six-year national development 
plan, the government's economic stimulus package, increasing 
private consumption, and stable consumer prices. 
  Citing estimates made by the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) and the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and 
Statistics (DGBAS), the bank noted that the world economy should 
grow 3 percent this year as compared with 2.2 percent last year, 
and said the domestic economy should expand 6.24 percent in the 
third quarter and 6.30 percent in the fourth quarter. 
  The estimated economic growth for the latter half of the 
year 
is better than that of the first six months, which the DGBAS put 
at 5.58 percent. 
  The bank, one of the three big banks run by the Taiwan 
provincial government -- the other two being Hua Nan Commercial 
Bank and Chang Hwa Commercial Bank, also saw some negative 
factors coming into play in the next six months. 
  These include increasing government debt, sluggishness in 
domestic investment, a lack of progress in major construction 
projects, the worsening labor shortage, uncertainty caused by 
ever- increasing indirect trade across the Taiwan Strait, and 
stiff export competition from the mainland and Southeast Asian 
countries, the bank report elaborated. 
  The government's debt level is expected to soar to an 
all-time high of NT$1.37 trillion (U.S.$50.55 billion) in fiscal 
1995, which begins on July 1. 
  Meanwhile, the report saw as a positive sign the expected 
stable growth of the domestic money supply between July and 
December. It said the M2 supply should grow at an annual rate 
of between 14 percent and 16 percent, or near the 15 percent 
target set by the Central Bank of China. 
  The broadly-defined M2 is the total stock of money in the 
national economy comprising cash in circulation, checking and 
demand deposits, passbook savings accout , plus quasi-money 
(including time deposits and treasury bills). 
  The M2 supply rose by 14.84 in the first quarter, higher 
than 
the 14.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1993. The money 
supply increased by a 12-month high of 15.41 percent in April. 
  The expected improvement in foreign trade, growing foreign 
investment in the domestic stock market, and the lowering of 
domestic interest rates are expected to help push up the capital 
demand from the private sector, the report pointed out. 
  Taiwan's foreign trade surplus totaled only U.S.$590 million 
in the first four months of the year, down 66.9 percent from the 
year- earlier level, while foreign institutional investors have 
applied to invest U.S.$9.347 billion in the Taiwan stock 
exchange since the ban on foreign stock investment was lifted in 
late 1992. 
  In addition, domestic financial institutions slashed 
interest 
rates one after another last week following similar moves in 
March and April.

<F P=106> [By Sally Blyth, political correspondent and Rain Ren] </F>
  [Text] Britain has effectively issued an ultimatum to 
China, warning that there has to be an agreement on the future 
of Hong Kong's military sites by the end of this month. 
  The deadline has angered Chinese officials who said they 
would not tolerate any suggestion of a British ultimatum. "We 
think we have been too lenient towards all sorts of British 
requirements in this regard," a mainland official said last 
night. "In principle, Britain should hand over all the sites to 
us." 
  British sources said that unless an accord was endorsed by 
the next full meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group 
[JLG], likely to be held by the end of this month, many of the 
military facilities to be built for the People's Liberation Army 
would not be completed by 1997. There are fears that without an 
agreement on the military land, construction projects, in 
particular the Central-Wan Chai reclamation, might have to be 
put on hold. 
  Britain is aiming for a settlement before the Legislative 
Council's summer recess next month. Officials say this is 
dictated by "practical considerations", such as the finance 
committee having to approve any funds required to build a new 
naval base for China. Negotiations are scheduled to start this 
week between experts from China and Britain. Talks have been 
under way for seven years. 
  A party of Chinese experts arrived in the territory last 
night to prepare for the meeting expected to be held this 
afternoon at the venue for the JLG meetings. The dozen 
delegates will hold a meeting this morning to discuss whether 
there is a need to meet their British counterparts this 
afternoon. 
  A British JLG official refused to confirm the meeting but 
said informal contacts between the two countries had been going 
on. 
  An agreement seemed likely last month but the British said 
China changed its position by making further demands. China, in 
turn, has accused Britain of playing "propaganda tricks". 
  "Nothing was settled after last month's meeting," a Chinese 
official said. "We have never given Britain a definite yes to 
their offer. We only said we needed to report back to a higher 
authority. Then, when we finally responded to the British, they 
said we were making new demands. What a trick. They probably 
just want us to accept whatever is on the list. As to which 
sites and how many of them should be passed to the Hong Kong 
government for redevelopment, it is purely a matter between the 
People's Liberation Army [PLA] and Hong Kong's future 
government. Look at how many sites the British army has 
occupied and look at how many the Chinese PLA will be able to 
get." 
  He complained that Britain was willing to give China only 30 
per cent of the residential blocks available. "This is also 
despite the fact that all expenditure for the PLA garrison to be 
stationed in Hong Kong will be borne by the Chinese Government," 
he said. 
  He then criticised Britain for making public some unresolved 
matters in a bid to create a false impression that the two 
countries were close to a deal. 
  It is already known that the PLA will take over The Prince 
of 
Wales Building and the land to the west of it but Britain needs 
agreement from China to redevelop the naval base which forms 
part of the reclamation project. 
  China was furious when the government unilaterally announced 
that it was relocating the British naval base to Stonecutters 
Island. 
  It would be almost impossible to persuade private developers 
to build on the site, even if it was filled in, without an 
agreement with Beijing. 
  In all, it is estimated the Government would stand to lose 
more than $1bn from the military sites it is hoping to sell off.

  [Text] Presumably, there is a Government human rights 
policy even if it has not been communicated to Michael Suen, the 
Policy Secretary responsible for this matter. Suen has gone on 
record to say that plans are indeed in place for combating 
sexual harassment, protecting pregnant workers, and combating 
discrimination on grounds of marital status. Over the weekend 
he appeared to be saying the new Equal Opportunities Bill was 
the last word on this matter and he was not aware of any other 
anti-discrimination legislation in the pipeline. 
  If the Secretary for Home Affairs, who gives every 
impression 
of performing a distasteful task, is confused, it is little 
wonder that the public also is wondering what on earth is going 
on. A knee-jerk reaction would be to blame Michael Suen for not 
being on top of the job. This may turn out to be the case but 
the lack of clear signals on human rights matters comes from the 
top. 
  The government's hesitation in implementing 
anti-discriminatory legislation and access to information 
proposals, currently the subject of private members bills, gives 
rise to the suspicion that the commitment to a full-scale human 
rights agenda is lacking. 
  In private, the government has indicated it is preparing to 
move in the right direction but is taking care to avoid 
littering the path with symbolic gestures which would only serve 
to raise Chinese government objections. 
  The government's stance is naive on the one hand, and 
dishonest on the other. First, it is naive to assume that China 
will not object to so-called nonsymbolic human rights gestures, 
such as an access to information bill. Surely, it has become 
clear there are highly trained human rights sniffers in Beijing 
who can detect the slightest hint of human rights reform, 
however it is dressed up. 
  Whatever steps are being taken to enhance the human rights 
regime, China will object and do so with vigour. It is 
therefore essential that the government comes clean on its human 
rights agenda and clearly explains measures to be taken and why. 
If the government believes these measures are right and just, 
it should say so. If it behaves in a furtive manner, suggesting 
that there is something to be ashamed of in its actions, it will 
only convey the impression that it is trying to sell shoddy 
goods. 
  Some members of the administration are opposed to 
legislation 
that eliminates discrimination and are even more violently 
opposed to laws that give the public the right to know what 
officialdom is doing. They are fighting a rearguard campaign to 
stop the spread of what they see as the human rights virus. 
  The time has come for leadership. Either Governor Chris 
Patten bows to their wishes or he must tell them that government 
policy is irrevocably set in the direction of enhancing the 
rights of the people of Hong Kong. There is no halfway house in 
sight. 
  Not only should the government come clean about its 
intentions but it should also campaign vigorously for what it 
believes. Some faint hearts in the administration fear a human 
rights campaign would not win public support. We challenge them 
to point to a single demonstration that has called for less 
human rights. Sure, there will be and have been protests in 
favour of retaining privilege, as witnessed by the New 
Territories inheritance issue. 
  Yet, such is the strength of feeling in favour of securing 
and extending the rights of the people that practically no one 
would come out and openly argue the case for less human rights. 
At most, the doubters will advance the view that human rights 
cannot be extended because China might object. The Government 
should capitalise on public sentiment, rather than cower in the 
shadow of human rights opponents. It should also provide 
concrete examples that show why human rights is not an abstract 
concept. 
  In Hong Kong, it means the right to determine if officials 
are gathering information about residents of the territory that 
may be incorrect and damaging. It means that female workers do 
not have to tolerate sexual harassment in the workplace. It 
also means that the right to housing and other essential 
services cannot be denied on grounds of race, religion, or other 
considerations of a discriminatory nature. 
  These are real issues, affecting everyday life. The Patten 
administration has led the public to believe it is concerned 
about matters of this kind. It is hard to overstate the 
disappointment and disillusion that will ensue in Hong Kong if 
the administration starts to back track on these issues. 
  We are used to the cynicism of politicians who judge policy, 
on whether it will enhance their popularity. We see no reason 
to make Hong Kong an even more fertile ground for nurturing this 
kind of cynicism.

<F P=106> [By Lindy Course] </F>
  [Text] A man was arraigned and sentenced in total secrecy 
in the High Court yesterday in an unprecedented move, contrary 
to the Bill of Rights. Wong Chi-keung's case was listed before 
Deputy Judge Jones on Friday and yesterday for plea to be taken 
and sentence passed. However, Friday's hearing was in chambers 
and yesterday's was in camera, meaning the press and the public 
could not attend. 
  Counsel for the Crown, Alan Lucas, and the defence lawyer, 
Peter Callaghan, would not reveal what had happened except to 
say that the judge had been given a good reason before ordering 
the unusual course. 
  Wong was given an undisclosed sentence on an unknown charge 
or charges. 
  Article 10 of the Bill of Rights states that any judgment in 
a criminal case shall be made public except where juveniles are 
involved or it is a matrimonial case. 
  According to a list of criminal cases in the Supreme Court 
lobby, Wong was charged with two counts of trafficking in 
dangerous drugs. 
  A judge can hold a criminal hearing in camera, under the 
Criminal Procedure Ordinance, only if it is in the interests of 
justice or public order or if it is for the safety or well being 
of a witness or any other person. 
  In previous sensitive cases, part of the proceedings have 
been held in chambers, where the sentencing judge can be 
informed of facts which are not revealed in open court. 
However, the charge or charges are made public and so is the 
sentence. 
  However, there is a precedent in the English courts where a 
case was heard in camera although the sentence was made public. 
On appeal the court said it should only be done in exceptional 
circumstances and should be avoided if there was any other way 
of serving the interests of justice. 
  Vice-chairman of the Bar Association, Gladys Li QC, said 
last 
night that the case was a worrying move, especially at this time 
in the territory's history and she wanted to find out more about 
the case. 
  A leading constitutional law expert strongly criticised what 
he termed a "cosy little arrangement" between the prosecution 
and defence saying it undermined the rule of law. "Is this a 
foretaste of the secret trials for the future? It is positively 
disgraceful. I cannot think of this ever happening in the 
Commonwealth since the days of the Star Chamber in the 16th 
century. "You cannot have a private arraignment. What is so 
sad is that the Attorney-General wanted it to happen," he said. 
  A number of lawyers with international experience said they 
had never come across a similar case. They said the judge 
should have appointed a lawyer as a friend of the court if the 
interests of both parties before him coincided, which may not 
have been in the public interest.

  [Text] Macao, June 4 (XINHUA) -- "We have a long story of 
the cooperation with China, and that is the most important 
capital we have to use Macao as a business platform into China." 
  Macao Governor General Vasco Joaquim Rocha Vieira made these 
remarks when met a visiting Portuguese delegation of 
entrepreneurs here today. 
  He said, "our strategy is a long-term strategy, not only to 
1999, but we must invest in the future of Macao after 1999", 
adding that the Macao Government is supporting contacts and 
links with China. 
  Chairman of the Industrial Association of Portugal Angelo 
Ludgero Marques, who led the delegation, told the governor that 
after their recent visit to Guangdong Province, south China, 
they have found big opportunities to invest and set up joint 
ventures in south China. He said, "this is not only a 
challenge, it has become a reality." the chairman said, next 
month his association would open an office in Guangzhou and 
would send another delegation to Macao for business and to 
support those in China's mainland. 
  It is learned that in 1993, Portugal exported 230 million 
Hong Kong dollars (28.8 million U.S. dollars) worth of goods to 
China, and China's exports to Portugal reached 1.33 billion Hong 
Kong dollars (about 1.66 billion U.S. dollars) in value. 
  The delegation visited Guangdong Province from may 27 to 
June 
3 and arrived in Macao for a four-day visit on Friday.

  [Text] Macao, June 6 (XINHUA) -- The making and adoption of 
the Macao Basic Law is advantageous to the maintenance of 
Macao's long-term social stability and economic development and 
also a legal guarantee for Macao's bright future, a Chinese 
official said here this afternoon. 
  Chen Ziying, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office of the State Council, made these remarks at a 
symposium held by the Macao Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. 
  With the adoption of the Basic Law, Chen said, the next 
thing 
to do is how to publicize the law, adding that it is not only 
important to propagate the Basic Law in Macao, but also 
important in China's mainland. It is favorable to the 
implementation of the policy of "one country, two systems", he 
pointed out. 
  He continued that in publicizing the Basic Law, every thing 
to be done during the transitional period must be carried out in 
convergence with the regulations of the Macao Basic Law. 
  He said he was convinced that Macao has a bright future, for 
Macao has such a legal guarantee, support of the motherland, 
good cooperation between the governments of China and Portugal 
and the mass of patriotic compatriots. 
  At the invitation of the Association for Promotion of the 
Macao Basic Law, a delegation led by Chen Ziying and Li Hou, 
former deputy director of the Drafting Committee of the Macao 
Basic Law, arrived here this morning for a four-day visit.

  [Text] Macao, June 6 (XINHUA) -- A six-day export 
commodities fair the first ever before held by east China's 
Jiangsu Province opened at the Macao Exhibition Center this 
afternoon. 
  Exhibits coming from 69 trade enterprises and joint ventures 
of the province cover silk and textile products, light 
industrial and electronic products, arts and crafts, chemicals, 
machinery, foodstuffs and agricultural and sideline products. 
  Jiangsu is one of the economically-developed provinces in 
China. In 1993, the province's total gross domestic product 
reached 255 billion yuan (28.3 billion U.S. dollars), 18.5 
percent more than that of the previous year; the total 
industrial and agricultural output value stood at 768.2 billion 
yuan (85 billion dollars), which also marks a large increase 
margin over 1992. 
  Meanwhile, Jiangsu has set up an industrial network covering 
textile, light industry, machinery, electronics, petrochemistry 
and building materials, the output value of which accounted for 
80 percent of the province's total. 
  Exporting more than 1,000 varieties of commodities, Jiangsu 
Province has established trade relations with 159 countries and 
regions worldwide. The province exported 5.96 billion dollars 
in 1993, 1.3 billion dollars more than that in 1992; imports 
totaled 2.73 billion dollars, increasing by 72.96 percent over 
1992. 
  The province's exports to Hong Kong last year reached 1.49 
billion dollars, up 20 percent over 1992.

<F P=106> [Summary of an interview with Chinese Vice Premier and </F>
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen by TOKYO SHIMBUN Chairman Miichiro 
Kato at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing on 13 April] 
  [Text] [Kato] The deadline for the United States' 
decision on the renewal of most-favored-nation (MFN) trade 
status for China is drawing near. What do you predict? 
  [Qian Qichen] "If the United States does not want to cut off 
its economic relations with China, then problems should be 
settled. There is a very strong view supporting an extension of 
the MFN status among American business leaders." 
  [Kato] Hopes are placed on China's role in persuading North 
Korea to accept nuclear inspections by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA]. How does China view the situation, and 
what is China's role? 
  [Qian Qichen] "China does not want to see the issue 
discussed at the UN Security Council [UNSC]. We have been 
stressing that the issue should be settled thorough negotiations 
in three channels involving four countries -- between North 
Korea and the United States, between North and South Korea, and 
between North Korea and the IAEA. I am sure some progress will 
be made if they patiently continue to hold negotiations within 
this framework. There is the possibility that if resolutions 
should be adopted at the UNSC at the present stage, the current 
framework for dialogue will be broken, and that mutual 
contradiction will further deepen. China has maintained its 
position that the UNSC should announce a non-binding statement 
by the UNSC president." 
  [Kato] North Korea has rejected the statement. What do you 
think of it? 
  [Qian Qichen] "North Korea's rejection of the statement is 
understandable because it opposes the UNSC taking up the issue. 
It appears the situation is gradually moving in the right 
direction after the announcement of the presidential statement." 
  [Kato] Is it correct that underlying China's emphasis on 
patient persuasive efforts is its conclusion -- based on its own 
information -- that North Korea's nuclear development is not 
imminent or that China bases its position, while judging that 
North Korea's nuclear development is in progress, on its fears 
that there is the possibility that North Korea will take 
unexpected action if pressure is applied to North Korea? 
  [Qian Qichen] "(Concerning progress in North Korea's nuclear 
development) it is difficult to make a clear judgment. The IAEA 
says that North Korea already has a five-megawatt reactor, and 
that a larger reactor is under construction. But at present, 
there is no evidence that proves the transfer of radioactive 
materials. China has no right to check North Korea's nuclear 
facilities. China, for its part, insists that the Korean 
peninsula should be denuclearized. If a military conflict should 
break out there, it will greatly affect China and Japan, as well 
as the surrounding nations. But the United States is over 
10,000 kilometers away." 
  [Kato] Is there any schedule for mutual visits by top 
leaders of both China and North Korea? 
  [Qian Qichen] "Absolutely not." 
  [Kato] If the United States decides on an extension of the 
MFN trade status to China, will it be easier for China to 
persuade North Korea? 
  [Qian Qichen] "The two problems are completely different." 
  [Kato] Japan, while facing trade friction with the United 
States, has indicated its intention to obtain a permanent seat 
in the UNSC. What do you think of this? 
  [Qian Qichen] "Japan-U.S. trade friction has long existed 
and is an unavoidable issue. China also has a similar trade 
issue with the United States. I think the issue will be solved 
through thorough negotiations. Regarding Japan's becoming a 
permanent member of the UNSC, there is a difference in views 
among members of the United Nations, and the issue has not 
officially come up on the agenda of the UN session."

<F P=106> [Interview with Jiang Enzhu, Chinese deputy foreign minister </F>
responsible for European affairs and in charge of negotiations 
on Hong Kong, by Josette Alia; date and place not given: "The 
Americans Better Watch Out"] 
  [Text] [Alia] Minister, what practical results do you 
expect from Mr. Balladur's visit to China? 
  [Enzhu] This visit marks the normalization of relations 
between France and China following the recent vicissitudes. 
This normalization should improve our economic and commercial 
relations, which I welcome. 
  [Alia] Why did you react so harshly to France's sale of 
planes to Taiwan? The United States, which did the same thing, 
has not been ostracized by you in the same way. 
  [Enzhu] Selling arms to Taiwan when you have diplomatic 
relations with us amounts to an attack on our sovereignty, to 
interference in our internal affairs. It is a matter of 
principle, and on this point we treat everybody in the same way. 
If unofficial or nongovernmental organizations do trade with 
Taiwan, we obviously cannot object. But we are opposed to any 
official contact between the countries which have recognized us 
and Taiwan. 
  [Alia] Warren Christopher's recent visit does not seem to 
have done much to ease tension in Sino-American relations. Do 
you not think that the problem of human rights is casting a 
shadow over your international image? 
  [Enzhu] Sino-American relations have improved markedly since 
the two presidents met in Seattle in November 1993. But it is 
obvious that our relations with the United States are not based 
on ideology or common values. They are based on the two sides' 
interests. We have close, if not identical, views on the 
settlement of regional and world conflicts. And Warren 
Christopher reaffirmed to us that the existence of a strong, 
stable, and prosperous China was in America's interests. 
  [Alia] What would you do if the United States did not renew 
the most favored nation clause for China? 
  [Enzhu] That would be a serious matter. Of course, China 
would suffer as a result, but so would the United States: Most 
exports of Chinese products to the United States are carried out 
by businessmen in Hong Kong and Taiwan, or by Sino-American 
joint ventures. If the clause of most favored nation was not 
renewed, American businessmen would be the first to suffer. 
  [Alia] You have not given me an answer on the human rights 
question... 
  [Enzhu] We refuse to link this question to other questions 
which have nothing to do with it, like the renewal of the most 
favored nation clause or our entry into GATT. It is a domestic 
problem. 
  [Alia] Well, do not link it to anything, but let us discuss 
it nonetheless. Why do you refuse to bow to international 
pressure? Is China so weak that it cannot release a few 
dissidents and introduce greater democracy into its regime? 
  [Enzhu] I would like to discuss this problem in general and 
not in the framework of the visit by an American leader. As you 
know, China has more than 1.2 billion inhabitants and our level 
of economic development is still fairly low. We have 30 
provinces which are not all equally rich, and each represents 
virtually the equivalent of a West European country in numbers 
of inhabitants. Each year, there are 16 million new babies born, 
in other words the equivalent of the population of the 
Netherlands, 16 million additional citizens to whom food, 
healthcare, housing, education, transport, and jobs must be 
supplied! It is a very difficult task. We have already improved 
the living standards of hundreds of millions of Chinese and 
eradicated famine. And yet 80 million people still live below 
the poverty line in some remote regions of China. 
  How can these many huge problems be tackled? We have decided 
that the main priority would be the economic development of the 
whole country. This is because improving the population's 
standard of living means ensuring the most basic of human 
rights, because we want above all to meet the mosts basic needs 
of 1.2 billion inhabitants. But this can only be done with 
order and political stability. Like any government, ours must 
strive to implement the law and maintain social order. This 
obviously leads to our punishing those who violate that law. 
  That is why we hope that the Western countries, particularly 
the West European countries, far from ignoring it, will propose 
specific initiatives for China's stability. It is in their 
interest too: Between now and the end of the century, Chinese 
imports of machinery, consumer durables, transport equipment, 
energy, telecommunications equipment, and advanced technology 
are bound to increase. In all these spheres, France and the 
other West European countries have many assets... 
  [Alia] At present, you seem to be excluding Britain, with 
which you are having discussions on the subject of Hong Kong. 
  [Enzhu] Britain claims to want to develop democracy in Hong 
Kong, but it has dominated that territory for 150 years without 
practising any democracy: Until 1991, London directly appointed 
the members of the Hong Kong councils, and then only some of 
them were elected. Why is Britain so suddenly concerned to 
introduce a political system it has hitherto rejected? Why is 
it not honoring its pledges? To be able to continue to exert 
its influence. But, whatever happens, China will regain 
sovereignty over Hong Kong, as planned, on 1 July 1997, and what 
has happened before will be nul and void. 
  [Alia] Will you change Hong Kong's political system? 
  [Enzhu] We will carry out peaceful reunification according 
to the formula "one state, two systems" on which we have given a 
promise, in other words Hong Kong will continue to be an 
international financial center and a free port, and foreign 
commercial investments and interests will be protected by law 
there. 
  [Alia] You have just signed similar protection agreements 
with Taiwan. Is this not tantamount to recognizing Taiwan? 
  [Enzhu] Not at all. We have just given guarantees to the 
Taiwanese businessmen investing in China. Taiwan is still an 
integral part of Chinese territory. 
  [Alia] Last October, you carried out a nuclear test, whereas 
France, Russia, and the United States had just decided to extend 
the moratorium on tests. Were you trying to issue a political 
warning or did you have technical reasons for acting in that way? 
  [Enzhu] We carried out an underground nuclear test because, 
for a long period, we had stopped testing, which was a kind of 
de facto moratorium. Indeed, of all the nuclear countries, it 
is China which has carried out fewest tests. But we are still 
in favor of a total ban, if an agreement to this effect can be 
signed.

  [Text] Washington, June 6 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Assistant 
Secretary of State Robert Gallucci continued discussions with 
South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu in New York today on 
possible sanction against the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea (DPRK), the State Department announced here. 
  Gallucci began consultations on possible sanction against 
the 
DPRK with a South Korean special envoy and Japanese officials in 
Washington on Friday [3 June] and Saturday. 
  "We've had useful and productive consultations so far with 
officials from Japan and the Republic of Korea," said Christine 
Shelly, State Department spokeswoman, at a regular news briefing. 
  "All sides had agreed to consult closely as the U.N. 
Security 
Council considers its next steps on the North Korean nuclear 
issue," Shelly said. 
  "We are also continuing our exchanges up in New York, via 
the 
Security Council mechanisms and discussions in that context," 
she added. 
  "I think there's a very full range of exchanges on this 
right 
now," she claimed, but "at this point, no draft resolution has 
been circulated or distributed in the council." 
  Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff 
will be traveling to Japan and South Korea this week for more 
discussions, Shelly said.

  [Text] Washington, June 6 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
today joined the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in calling for 
an immediate cease-fire in Yemen and adherence to all provisions 
of U.N. Security Council Resolution 924. 
  The GCC issued a statement on June 4, expressing its support 
for the Resolution 924, which seeks an end to the crisis in 
Yemen. 
  The United States welcomed the statement and agreed with the 
GCC that Yemen's problem cannot be solved through military 
means, State Department Spokeswoman Christine Shelly told 
reporters at a regular news briefing. 
  "The United States looks to the GCC to continue its positive 
role in the Yemen crisis," shelly said. 
  "The U.S. strongly believes that all parties in Yemen must 
begin to work together to achieve reconciliation, without which 
peace and stability in Yemen are not possible," she said. 
  "We continue to call on both parties to halt the fighting 
immediately and to agree to resume their political dialogue, 
representing all Yemenis, which we believe can begin the process 
of reconciliation," she added. 
  The United States also urged both sides in Yemen to 
facilitate the efforts of the U.N. secretary general's 
fact-finding mission to Yemen.

<F P=106> [Article by Ku Ying (7357 4481): "The CPC Earnestly Hopes </F>
for Economic Cooperation With Britain"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Tian Jiyun "Clears Up the Mess" Left by Lu Ping </H5>
  The visit to Hong Kong by Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong 
and Macao Affairs Office, excited one sensation after another. 
  The visit to Hong Kong by another CPC big shot, however, was 
exceptionally played down and most Hong Kong people did not even 
know of his arrival. 
  The big shot is Tian Jiyun, member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau and vice chairman of the National 
People's Congress [NPC]. He made a two-day stopover in Hong 
Kong on his way home from a visit to foreign countries in 
mid-May. But his stay in Hong Kong was kept strictly 
confidential. 
  It was reported that Tian came to Hong Kong to take a rest. 
But anyone with a discerning eye knew that under the political 
situation in which "the Chinese side and the British Hong Kong 
Government are irreconcilably hostile to each other," "to take a 
rest" was a lame excuse. 
  In reality, Tian, who was travel-worn and weary, did not 
take 
a good rest in Hong Kong. Instead, he met with Hong Kong NPC 
and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference deputies, 
Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [PWC] members, and 
certain local businessmen--naturally those well-known tycoons he 
could trust. 
  Clearly Tian was entrusted with the task of "putting a 
certain message across to local people." It appeared that the 
CPC leaders, who were dissatisfied with the results of Lu Ping's 
visit to Hong Kong, "which failed to achieve what it had been 
designed to achieve," were eager to send Tian to Hong Kong to 
offer some clarification on certain matters. 
The Proposal To Reclaim Hong Kong Ahead of Schedule Had Been 
Supported by the 
<H5>  Majority of Party, Government, and Military </H5>
Leaders 
  At the meeting, Tian answered every question. He aired his 
"personal views" on many questions put to him in a great effort 
to reassure local people. 
  Tian answered some sensitive questions concerning the latter 
half of the transitional period. 
  Question: Will China reclaim Hong Kong ahead of time? 
  Tian: When Britain changed its policy toward China in the 
fall of last year [as published] and had its own way in Hong 
Kong, many people on the mainland favored recovering sovereignty 
over Hong Kong before the due date. There was a strong demand 
for this in the party, in the NPC Standing Committee, and in the 
military. Some Hong Kong industrialists also went to Beijing to 
ask the central authorities to take decisive measures because 
they feared Hong Kong would get out of control and be plunged 
into confusion. Our comrades in the party and the government 
were also divided on whether the principle of "one country, two 
systems" could be put into effect. The central authorities 
finally decided that though the Chinese side had failed to 
obtain cooperation from the British side on Hong Kong's 
constitutional reform, it would try its best to achieve 
cooperation with the latter in other fields with a view to 
reducing the possible shocks and chaos in the transitional 
period to a certain extent while stepping up all necessary 
preparations against sudden incidents. 
<H5>  Tian Predicts That Hong Kong Will Possibly Experience a Shock </H5>
  Question: Will there be turbulence in the latter half of the 
transitional period? 
  Tian: In my view, in the transitional period, some people 
will create confusion and disturbance by taking advantage of the 
setting up of the PWC, the formation of the Special 
Administrative Government [SAR] Government, the transfer of 
political power to China by the Hong Kong colonialist 
government, the appointment of secretarial-level officials by 
the SAR Government, the abolition of laws and regulations 
contradicting the Basic Law, and the banning of some extremist 
organizations in accordance with the Basic Law. The central 
department concerned has studied all these possibilities. The 
central authorities have since 1990 made preparations against a 
big economic shock or even economic collapse. The mainland has 
injected more capital into Hong Kong than any other foreign 
country and has made substantial commitments to certain friendly 
countries and conglomerates. So if there is no great 
disturbance on the mainland, there will be no sustained economic 
shock or collapse in Hong Kong. However, social unrest and an 
economic shock may be unavoidable. We cannot pin any hope on 
the British authorities. 
<H5>  "Hong Kong Will Be Worthless Without Stability" </H5>
  Question: Will China really carry out the principle of "one 
country, two systems" after 1997? 
  Tian: The central government has pursued a consistent 
policy toward Hong Kong. No mainland system will be applied in 
Hong Kong and no attempts to turn Hong Kong into a city where 
all political forces wrestle with each other are allowed. 
Otherwise who will invest in Hong Kong? At the same time, we 
will prevent Hong Kong from evolving into a welfare society. 
Hong Kong is a small place short of natural resources, so an 
economic recession or a severe economic slump could easily 
occur. Hong Kong's value lies in its stable social environment, 
and it will be utterly worthless without stability. 
<H5>  "Local People Will Be Allowed To Hurl Abuse at the CPC After </H5>
1997" 
  Question: Will press freedom be guaranteed after 1997? 
  Tian: After the founding of the SAR Government 1 July 1997, 
people will still be allowed to hurl abuse at the CPC and the 
press to publish articles criticizing mainland policies and 
systems. A sound political party enjoying popular support is 
immune to invective. Over the last few years, some people have 
cursed the CPC every day, criticizing everything. They even 
cooperated with Britons in cursing us. Mainland people reacted 
strongly to this abuse, but we persuaded them not to fight back. 
Naturally, no organized subversive, inflammatory, or hostile 
activities are allowed. 
  Question: Will Shanghai take over Hong Kong's role by the 
end of this century or by 2005? 
  Tian: Shanghai has grown rather rapidly due to favorable 
conditions. Shanghai is trying to rank among other big 
international cities in terms of defense and high-tech 
industries, finance, transportation, and trade. However, Hong 
Kong has its own characteristics and strong points, so it will 
not be replaced. 
<H5>  The CPC Has Taken Action on Many Occasions To Shatter Hong </H5>
Kong People's Vulnerable Confidence 
  According to the businessmen who met with Tian, in contrast 
to those fierce officials responsible for Hong Kong affairs, 
Tian was undoubtedly much more amiable. Though what he said was 
cliches, he was sincere and did not dodge sensitive questions. 
The businessmen present appreciated his frankness and 
sincerity. As compared with Lu Ping, who made Hong Kong people 
feel ill at ease on his last visit, Tian certainly acted in a 
timely way to reassure local people. Tian said: The CPC is 
trying to cooperate with Britain in fields other than the 
political one. Does this imply that the CPC will carry out a 
tough political policy while adopting a "flexible economic 
policy"? This remark by Tian merits attention. 
  However, there is a serious problem: The CPC has made 
sincere and solemn promises over the last 10 years, but it has 
taken action to kill Hong Kong people's weak and vulnerable 
confidence on various occasions. The principle of "one country, 
two system" and the promise "to keep Hong Kong's capitalist 
system unchanged for 50 years" have become terms which people 
ridicule. China, big country as it is, has actually failed to 
capture Hong Kong people's confidence. Such a distorted 
situation brought about by the rule of man is unfortunate for 
the CPC as well as for Hong Kong people.

<F P=106> ["Full text" of speech delivered by Zhao Ziyang, then </F>
General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, at Fourth 
Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee in "late June 
1989" in Beijing] 
  [Text] Editor's note: On the eve of the fifth anniversary 
of the 4 June Incident, a source provided us with the full text 
of former CPC general secretary Zhao Ziyang's speech to the 
Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee in late 
June 1989 after he lost power. The speech was Zhao's 
self-criticism and defense of his behavior in handling the 
student unrest. We cannot seek official confirmation of the 
authenticity of the text; however, based on the reliability of 
the source and according to the conclusion of experienced 
experts on Chinese information, we think that the text is highly 
credible. 
  The text reveals the opinions of the top CPC authorities at 
the time on the mass demonstrations in Tiananmen Square as well 
as the mutual disagreements between party officials on the 
handling of the events. The impact of the 1989 pro-democracy 
movement on China can be seen in many areas, and the text can be 
taken as a footnote on the political storm's impact on the 
Beijing superstructure. [end editor's note] 
  The current Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central 
Committee has taken disciplinary measures regarding my case. I 
welcome this criticism from my comrades. Over the past few 
years, there have been many shortcomings, mistakes, errors, and 
instances of incompetence in my work. I have failed to live up 
to the party, the people, and the comrades. Now, I just want to 
explain some of the facts surrounding my mistakes and make a 
self-criticism. 
<H5>  I </H5>
  First I would like to mention some facts concerning the 
student unrest and the turmoil and my state of mind at that time. 
  Ever since mid-April, as the student demonstrations grew 
ever 
larger, all I and everyone else wanted was to calm the situation 
as soon as possible. I have already said that I never agreed 
with the students' taking to the streets to stage demonstrations 
without making applications according to the stipulations of the 
laws; still less did I approve of class strikes or hunger 
strikes. I repeatedly called for solving the problems on the 
basis of democracy and the legal system. I also said that, even 
though demonstrations can be approved according to the law, 
school leaders and party organizations should still actively 
dissuade students from doing this and should try their best to 
guide them to express their opinions through regular channels or 
in other forms. My attitude in this regard was always explicit. 
  However, I also noticed two noteworthy characteristics in 
the 
student unrest. First, the students put forward slogans, such 
as supporting the Constitution, promoting democracy, and 
opposing corruption. These demands were basically in line with 
the position of the party and the government, and we could 
hardly turn them down. Second, a large number of people took 
part in the demonstrations or expressed support for the 
demonstrators, and they included people from all walks of life. 
Huge crowds of people took to the streets in Beijing. Under 
these circumstances, I thought that, in order to calm the 
situation, the first thing was to appease the vast majority of 
the people and affirm the mainstream. The enthusiasm of the 
broad masses of the students demanding reform and opposing 
corruption is a precious thing which should be fully affirmed. 
At the same time, we should accept the reasonable opinions of 
the masses and adopt positive rectification and correction 
measures. In this way we would calm the feelings of most people 
and enable the majority of the masses to understand and support 
the practice of the party and the government. It would then be 
easier to deal with the small number of evil people. 
  In connection with this idea, I also felt that there were 
some problems with the 26 April [RENMIN RIBAO] editorial. That 
is, the editorial did not affirm the mainstream formed by the 
vast majority of the people; instead, it concluded in general 
terms that the nature of the entire event was a contradiction 
between the enemy and ourselves, a conclusion which the majority 
of people could not accept. It was true that a very small 
number of people who opposed the four cardinal principles tried 
to fish in troubled waters. However, it is hard to justify the 
conclusion that the actions of hundreds of thousands of people 
were manipulated by a small number of people. The students 
maintained that the 26 April editorial attached a label to them, 
and they became rather emotional. Therefore, I proposed that 
some changes be made in the editorial to soften it a little. 
  My views were only expressed at the meetings of the central 
Standing Committee, and I only exchanged opinions with a small 
number of central leading comrades within this circle. At that 
moment, I thought that whether my views were correct was one 
thing, but whether I should express them was a different matter 
altogether. In any case, I thought that my views should be 
expressed at the Standing Committee meeting, and just expressing 
them would not be a problem. Of course, everyone else became 
aware of this issue later, and they gradually changed the 
wording and tone of their speeches and also made statements to 
affirm the patriotic enthusiasm of the students. I felt that, 
if these words had been written into the 26 April editorial and 
if the editorial had not branded the entire event as a 
contradiction between the enemy and ourselves, then most people 
would not have been so infuriated. With our additional efforts, 
the event might not have become as serious as it did. This was 
my thinking at the time. 
  In short, I thought that the actions of the broad masses 
of young students and their many sympathizers in society should 
be strictly distinguished from those of an extremely small 
number of people who tried to use the student unrest to fish in 
troubled waters, create disturbances, and attack the party and 
socialism. I thought that the student unrest as a whole should 
not be regarded in general terms as an antagonistic 
contradiction between the enemy and ourselves ("a premeditated 
plot," "in essence, it was aimed at thoroughly negating the 
party's leadership and the socialist system.") [quotations from 
the 26 April RENMIN RIBAO editorial] I thought that we should 
have primarily used the methods of persuasion and guidance to 
avoid intensifying the contradiction and calm the situation as 
soon as possible. This was the main point of my different 
opinion. 
  I would like to explain one more thing. I never objected to 
using the term "turmoil." I thought, however, that "turmoil" 
should only refer to the scale of the student unrest and its 
impact on the public order, not to the character of the event, 
which could have been either spontaneous or antagonistic. I 
touched on this point at the Standing Committee meeting on 16 
May. 
<H5>  II </H5>
  I have carefully reviewed my actions during the student 
unrest and turmoil in order to find out what I did correctly and 
what I did improperly or incorrectly. 
  First, before the memorial ceremony to mourn the death of 
Comrade Hu Yaobang, there were no differences within the 
Standing Committee -- or at least there were no major 
differences. Of course, with tens of thousands of students 
gathering in Tiananmen Square, everybody felt rather nervous and 
anxious. At the time, I thought that the crowds probably fell 
into three categories. The vast majority of the people just 
wanted to mourn the death of Comrade Yaobang; some people were 
expressing their unhappiness with our work; and only a small 
number of people were trying to aggravate the situation in order 
to oppose the party and socialism. I said that the party 
central body is in charge of the funeral arrangements, and the 
students also wanted to express their sorrow over the death, so 
we could not prohibit them from mourning as well. Therefore, I 
said: Only those who engaged in illegal activities such as 
beating, smashing, looting, arson, and storming government 
buildings should be punished according to law, and mild and 
moderate methods should be used to deal with the majority of the 
people. I remember that, at that time, nobody raised any 
objection to this idea. The only thing that happened before the 
memorial meeting was on the evening of 19 April, when Comrade Li 
Peng telephoned me, saying that students were storming the 
Xinhua Gate [where the party center and government are located] 
and asking why nothing was being done. I said that Comrade Qiao 
Shi was in charge on the front lines, and he would cope with any 
contingency, as he had taken precautionary measures. Then I 
called Comrade Qiao Shi and told him. Aside from this, I do not 
recall hearing any disagreement from the Standing Committee 
members. 
  Second, after the end of the memorial meeting, I expressed a 
three-point opinion: 1) As the memorial activities have come to 
an end, social life should return to normal. The students 
should be resolutely dissuaded from staging any demonstrations 
and should be urged to return to their studies. 2) The method 
of persuasion and guidance should be used toward the students. 
We should open dialogue with them at various levels, in various 
forms, and through various channels in order to increase 
communications and mutual understanding. 3) Bloodshed must be 
avoided at all costs. If any instances of beating, smashing, 
looting, arson, or storming take place, those involved should be 
brought to justice according to the law. Comrade Li Peng and 
other members of the Standing Committee expressed their 
agreement. I was later told that Comrade Li Peng reported the 
three-point opinion to Comrade Xiaoping, and Comrade Xiaoping 
also expressed his approval. On the afternoon of 23 April, I 
left Beijing and began my visit to Korea. When seeing me off at 
the railway station, Comrade Li Peng asked me whether I had any 
other ideas, and I simply reaffirmed the three points. 
  Third, as I was not in Beijing between 24 April and the 
morning of 30 April, I am not very clear about what actually 
happened during this period. On the morning of 26 April, in 
Korea, I read the telexed texts of Comrade Xiaoping's talk and 
the minutes of the Standing Committee meeting (The RENMIN RIBAO 
editorial of 26 April was not telexed to me at that time). I 
immediately sent a reply, saying that "I completely agree with 
Comrade Xiaoping's decision on dealing with the current 
turmoil." As I understood it, the general spirit of Comrade 
Xiaoping's decision was to maintain stability and stop the 
turmoil. This is extremely important for our country. We 
should do our utmost to ensure this at any time, whether in the 
past, at present, or in the future. 
  Fourth, when the speech I delivered on 3 May at the rally 
in commemoration of the 4 May Movement was vetted by members of 
the Political Bureau and the Central Secretariat, many comrades 
expressed their opinions on revising the draft. We then revised 
the speech script in some places according to these views. In 
my memory, only two comrades proposed that "opposing bourgeois 
liberalization" be added to the speech, and one comrade proposed 
that the speech should mention "opposing spiritual pollution." 
At that time, I thought that, as the speech fully expounded the 
need to adhere to the four cardinal principles, it was 
unnecessary to add the phrase of "opposing bourgeois 
liberalization," as the term itself meant opposing the four 
cardinal principles. Stylistically speaking, the speech was 
aimed at positively expounding the significance of the 4 May 
Movement, and adding the phrase of "opposing bourgeois 
liberalization" to the speech would make the text less coherent 
and smooth. Therefore, the suggestion of the two comrades was 
not included. In the process of revising drafts of speeches, we 
have never been able to incorporate everybody's opinions. 
  Fifth, my speech on 4 May to the people attending the annual 
meeting of the Asian Development Bank [ADB] sought to promote 
the subsiding of the student unrest and strengthen foreign 
investors' confidence in China's stability. After the speech, 
the initial reactions were favorable, and, at the time, I was 
not aware of any problem. Comrade Li Peng also told me that me 
speech was good. He would make similar remarks when he later 
met the delegates to the ADB meeting. The tone of the speech 
was mild, and I did not think that this contradicted our 
previous position. Before I returned home from Korea, the 
second RENMIN RIBAO editorial (on 29 April) approved by Comrade 
Li Peng had already adopted a milder tone. During the dialogue 
authorized by the State Council, the spokesman also made it 
clear that the first editorial (on 26 April) was not aimed at 
the vast majority of the students. He repeatedly affirmed that 
99.9 percent of the students were good, and said that some of 
the problems pointed out by the students were things that the 
government wants to resolve. My speech on 4 May just made 
special reference to these points and its tone was completely 
consistent with the authorities' earlier statements. As I 
already mentioned some other points in my speech on 3 May (such 
as the issue of opposing turmoil), I did not repeat them on 4 
May. There were only two new points in my speech on 4 May. 
First, I said that the masses were satisfied with some aspects 
of the party and the government but were dissatisfied with some 
other aspects. I still think that this analysis was in line 
with the actual situation at that time. Second, I said that the 
problems should be resolved in a calm, sensible, restrained, and 
orderly atmosphere and on the basis of democracy and the legal 
system, and I still think that we should strive to solve 
problems in this way when we encounter any problems like this in 
the future. According to the response from all quarters, the 
effect of my speech was rather positive at the time. It is true, 
as some comrades later criticized, that my speech was not 
discussed by the Standing Committee in advance. However, our 
general practice was that speeches made by central leaders when 
meeting foreign visitors (except those concerning any official 
agreements) were not necessarily discussed by the Standing 
Committee beforehand. In general, we prepare these remarks 
ourselves in accordance with the established policies. When 
Comrade Li Peng met with the delegates attending the ADB meeting 
next day (on 5 May), his speech was not be discussed by the 
Standing Committee beforehand either, and the tone of his speech 
was quite similar to mine. In any case, my speech caused 
certain speculation which went beyond my expectations. If I had 
been more prudent and anticipated such problems, I might not 
have made that speech. 
  Sixth, I would like to talk about the 8 May Standing 
Committee meeting and the 10 May Political Bureau meeting. 
After the student demonstrations on 27 April, the students 
insisted that we change the conclusion about the nature of their 
activities as laid down in the 26 April editorial. I felt 
rather embarrassed. At the time, I tried to dodge that issue 
and first accomplish a number of good things to counter 
corruption and promote democracy so that the masses might see 
that we were actually making efforts as they hoped. In this way 
we could have gradually calmed down the situation. After 
everybody's tempers had cooled, it would be easier to achieve a 
consensus. Therefore, at the two meetings, I proposed that we 
submit a report on screening business companies to the Standing 
Committee of the National People's Congress [NPC], make public 
the personal property and income of senior cadres, to only 
provide special supplies for retired leaders aged over 80 years 
(or 75 years), and let the NPC Standing Committee organize a 
special committee to carry out independent investigations of 
complaints against senior cadres or their family members. 
(Comrade Wan Li, being more careful than I was in considering 
this issue, proposed that an authoritative Anticorruption 
Committee be set up within the NPC Standing Committee). On the 
basis of extensive discussion, it was decided that the press law 
and the demonstrations law could be enacted. My proposal was 
only mentioned briefly at the meetings of the Standing Committee 
and the Political Bureau so that it might be discussed in detail 
in the future. No official decision was made at that time. My 
basic purpose was to take anticorruption as an important element 
in our political structural reform and link anticorruption 
closely with democracy, the legal system, openness, 
transparency, mass supervision, and mass participation. On the 
morning of 13 May, when Comrade Shangkun and I went to see 
Comrade Xiaoping and report to him about our work, I told him 
about my idea. Comrade Xiaoping expressed his agreement and said 
that this opportunity should be used to properly solve the 
problem of corruption and that it is necessary to increase 
transparency. 
  Seventh, I would like to address the issue of my talks 
with Gorbachev. After the 13th party congress, on many 
occasions when meeting principal leaders of foreign parties, I 
told them that the First Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central 
Committee had made a decision reaffirming that Comrade 
Xiaoping's status as the primary decisionmaker in our party did 
not change. My purpose was to make the world more clearly 
understand that Comrade Xiaoping's status in our party had not 
changed since his withdrawal from the Standing Committee. This 
was legal according to the organizational rules. During my visit 
to Korea, I also said this to Chairman Kim Il-sung. Thus, what I 
told Gorbachev was in keeping with the usual practice; however, 
the problem was that, this time, my statements were reported 
publicly. After returning from Korea, I was told that, after 
Comrade Xiaoping's remarks on the student unrest had received 
broad dissemination, there was much discussion in society. 
People said that the Standing Committee members's report to 
Comrade Xiaoping was not in keeping with the organizational 
rules, and even harsher criticisms were expressed. I felt that 
it was necessary for me to clarify and explain this. 
  Some people also mentioned this issue at a discussion 
meeting 
with some trade union cadres two days before Gorbachev's visit. 
At that time, I made an explanation according to the decision 
made by the First Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central 
Committee, and this achieved good results. They said that we 
were not aware of this in the past, and it was good that the 
issue had been clarified. (Comrades Qiao Shi, Hu Qili, and Yan 
Mingfu were all present). Before that, in view of some people's 
mistaken comments about "holding court from behind a screen," 
Comrade Chen Xitong also gave an explanation on the comrades 
responsible for the work in universities and colleges. The 
explanation of the decision solemnly made by the First Plenary 
Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee always achieved 
positive results. Comrade Chen Xitong also mentioned this when 
delivering a work report to the Standing Committee meeting on 28 
April. Therefore, I thought that, if this was reported 
publicly, the masses would learn about it, and this might reduce 
people's uncalled-for criticisms. At that time, I told Comrade 
Gorbachev that the First Plenum of the 13th CPC Central 
Committee had made a solemn decision that Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
would still be at the helm for the most important issues. After 
the 13th party congress, when handling the most important 
issues, we always reported to Comrade Deng Xiaoping and asked 
for his instructions. (I purposefully did not mention that he 
could call meetings and have the final say.) Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping also always gave full support to our work and supported 
our collective decisions. In my view, these words would not 
give people the idea that everything was decided by Deng 
Xiaoping. I really could not imagine that such remarks would in 
turn harm Comrade Xiaoping. I am willing to bear all 
responsibility for this. 
  Eighth, I would like to discuss the meeting the Standing 
Committee held on the evening of 16 May. After returning from 
Korea, I heard strong reactions against the 26 April editorial 
from various quarters, and this had become a thorny problem 
affecting the feelings of the students. At that time, I 
considered whether we could untie the knot in order to calm the 
students' emotions. On 4 May, I told Comrade Li Peng about my 
views on the editorial. Comrade Li Peng expressed his 
disagreement, so I felt that it would be very very difficult to 
make any change. Then I spoke with Comrade Shangkun. I thought 
that we might first sidestep this thorny problem and play down 
the seriousness of the issue. At that time, Comrade Xiaoping 
was concentrating on the upcoming meeting with Gorbachev, and I 
could not disturb him with this issue. So I first told some 
comrades who were working with Comrade Xiaoping. I also 
exchanged opinions separately with other comrades in the 
Standing Committee in order to slowly make the change. On 13 
May, however, several hundred students began their hunger 
strike, and one of their major demands was to change the 
conclusion of the editorial. I felt that things were getting 
more serious, and it was then impossible to sidestep that issue 
any more. So I mention the matter at the meeting of the 
Standing Committee on the evening of 16 May (which was the first 
time I mentioned it at an official meeting). Comrade Li Peng 
said that such words as "this was a premeditated plot," "a round 
of turmoil," "in essence, it was aimed at thoroughly negating 
the leadership of the CPC and the socialist system," and "this 
is a round of serious political struggle that the whole party 
and the entire people of the whole nation are facing" were all 
the remarks uttered by Comrade Xiaoping, so they must not be 
changed. At that time, I did not agree with this argument, 
because I thought that the editorial should be written primarily 
according to the spirit of the meeting of the Standing Committee 
on 24 April. Comrade Xiaoping's words were made after listening 
to the report of the Standing Committee chaired by Comrade Li 
Peng. As Comrade Xiaoping always gave full support to the 
Standing Committee's work, as long as the decision was made 
collectively by the Standing Committee, he would certainly 
support it. Therefore, this responsibility should primarily be 
borne by ourselves. At the Standing Committee meeting on the 
evening of 16 May, I also said that, as I had sent a telegram 
from Korea to express my agreement with Comrade Xiaoping's 
decision, I should also bear responsibility for the 26 April 
editorial. At that time, I only asked the other Standing 
Committee members to consider my opinion, and did not require 
that a decision be made. As it was then too late, the issue was 
not further discussed. 
  Ninth, on 17 May, at a Standing Committee meeting held at 
Comrade Xiaoping's place, I was criticized by Comrade Li Peng 
and Comrade Yao Yilin, who put all the blame on my speech at the 
ADB annual meeting on 4 May for the escalation of the student 
unrest. The severeness of their criticisms went beyond my 
expectations. That meeting also reaffirmed the conclusion of the 
26 April editorial on the character of the events, and the 
decision to transfer troops to Beijing to enforce martial law. 
I said that it was better to make a decision than make no 
decision, but I was extremely worried that serious consequences 
might be caused. It would be extremely difficult for me to 
effectively organize the implementation of this decision. I 
expressed my concern frankly at a party meeting. After the 
meeting, I repeatedly considered this, and feared that because 
of the limitation of my consciousness and the condition of my 
thoughts, the resolute implementation of the Standing 
Committee's decision would be affected. When I was rather 
impatient and emotional, I expressed my hope to resign. After 
Comrade Shangkun learned about this, he immediately dissuaded 
me, and said that if I resigned, the sentiments of the masses 
would be further aroused. He said that members of the Standing 
Committee should still be able to continue to work together. I 
repeatedly considered Comrade Shangkun's sincere advice and felt 
that his words were correct. In those circumstances, no matter 
what happened, I must not do anything embarrassing to the party. 
So my resignation letter was not issued. However, the 
development of events still seriously upset me. On 18 May, I 
wrote a letter to Comrade Xiaoping, asking him to reconsider my 
opinion. I also telephoned Comrade Shangkun, asking him to give 
some explanation to Comrade Xiaoping. I felt that no matter 
what happened, it was still permissible to express my dissenting 
opinion inside the party. Being general secretary, if I did not 
express my dissenting opinion, it would just be irresponsible. 
In retrospect, although I did not issue the resignation letter, 
I actually had an idea about resignation. Against the 
background then, this was incorrect and improper. 
  Tenth, about calling on the hunger striking students in 
Tiananmen Square on the early morning of 19 May. On the third 
day after the students began their hunger strike, I planned to 
see them, but I failed to do so for various reasons after that, 
although I expressed this wish many times. On 19 May, the 
hunger strike entered its seventh day, and deaths might have 
occurred among the hunger strikers. The event came to a 
critical moment. People inside and outside the party required 
that Comrade Li Peng and I go to the square to persuade the 
students, and such petitions poured into our offices like 
snowflakes. The masses also expressed strong discontent at the 
fact that we had not gone to do this persuading for a long time. 
Some comrades said that if Premier Zhou was still alive, he 
would have certainly gone among the masses. I felt that if we 
still did not go out, we would not be able to justify ourselves 
before the people. At that time, I was very sick, but I still 
made up my mind to go to see the students. Their hunger strike 
had lasted seven days. In those circumstances, what else could 
we do if we did not personally persuade them to stop the hunger 
strike by showing our true feelings toward them? After we 
called on them, the students became less emotional, and 
announced the end of their hunger strike at 2100 that same day. 
I cannot say that what I said to them played any great role, 
but at least this did not produce any negative effects. After 
returning from the trip to see the students, I felt that my 
illness became more serious. 
  Eleventh, about my absence from the meeting on the evening 
of 
19 May. I want to explain here about that night I asked for 
sick leave from the Standing Committee. Comrade Qiao Shi also 
announced this at the meeting. My letter asking for sick leave 
was issued before the notice to hold the meeting was issued. 
That is, I asked for sick leave before I received notice of the 
meeting. That day, I felt dizzy at first, suffered headaches, 
and found it hard to stand firmly; in the evening, I suffered a 
heart attack. This was a fact. I asked for three days of sick 
leave. After my sick leave expired, I no longer had any work to 
do. I was no longer allowed to attend any meetings. And I did 
not know about anything later. 
  What I have mentioned above shows that I just tried to ease 
the confrontation with the students during the unrest and the 
turmoil in order to win over the vast majority of the students 
and to gradually calm down the student unrest. I was deeply 
worried about adopting tough measures before the contradiction 
with most people had been mitigated, and especially about the 
use of force, which would inevitably cause conflict and 
blood-letting and would lead to the aggravation of events. Even 
though the student unrest had calmed down, major effects would 
remain. Now, it seemed that this was just my wishful thinking, 
which was not realistic enough. Even if any concession was made 
with regard to the conclusion of the 26 April editorial, the 
contradiction might not be mitigated, and new troubles and 
problems might still arise one after another. Eventually, the 
intensification of the contradiction would still be inevitable. 
  Recently, Comrade Xiaoping made a very important speech, 
which profoundly enlightened me. He said: The occurrence of 
the storm was not determined by any people's wishes, and was the 
inevitable result of the international macroclimate and the 
domestic microclimate. He also said that it was better that it 
happened earlier than later. If we view things from this high 
plain, my thoughts and worry were certainly uncalled for. In 
those days, I really did not reach such a high plain of thinking 
and did not have such insight. I am willing to further give 
consideration to this issue through studying Comrade Xiaoping's 
speech. 
  III 
  As far as mistakes and shortcomings in economic work and 
responsibilities for these are concerned, Comrade Xiaoping has 
talked about the issue, and Comrade Li Peng has touched on it 
too. 
  My attitude is that all the shortcomings in economic work 
from my assuming office at the State Council until the Third 
Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee, should mainly 
be placed on me. Before the draft of the report to be delivered 
at the 1989 NPC session was submitted to the Political Bureau 
for discussion, Comrade Li Peng had sent a copy to me to solicit 
my opinion. I noticed that this draft report had repeatedly 
used the wording "for many years" when referring to the causes 
of faults. So I proposed applying an analytical approach to 
evaluating the issues which had arisen over the past few years. 
For example, the scale of capital construction projects covered 
by the budget had been brought under control by 1985, but what 
were not under control were those not covered by the budget. It 
does not tally with the facts if we blame everything on our 
being too anxious for success in reform. Having heard what I 
said, Comrade Li Peng said: Then let us place the focus on the 
issues we faced in 1988. Since this is an annual work report by 
the present government, he said it was acceptable that these 
issues from previous years should not be mentioned in it. I had 
no objection to this. Some comrades criticized me for not 
allowing Comrade Li Peng to talk in the report about the 
mistakes made in the past few years, and they said I was 
shirking the blame for mistakes in the past few years by blaming 
Comrade Li Peng. I must say that this is not true. Never have 
I had such intentions. 
  The economic situation had been generally good and the 
economy had been full of vigor before 1987, which was due to 
reform and opening up. We have achieved a great success in the 
economic work over the past few years, but we have committed 
quite a few mistakes and faults as well. As the principal 
person-in-charge of working on the front line, I should take the 
responsibility for such faults. We have failed to bring the 
scale of capital construction under control over the past few 
years, and so far we have not yet found any way to keep the 
scale of extra-budgetary capital construction projects and the 
amount of consumption funds, which are growing at too high a 
speed, under effective control. Comrades Xiaoping, Chen, 
Xiannian, and Peng Zhen have all reminded us of the agriculture 
problem. But for quite a long time, we have not really taken 
any effective measures to deal with it until the meeting on 
agriculture last year. The responsibility for all these faults 
should be laid on me. 
  Before 1988, our country had never experienced any 
substantial inflation. Of course, some factors that could have 
possibly aggravated inflation had been growing during that 
period. The direct cause of the remarkable inflation last year 
was that our evaluation of the situation the year before last 
had been too optimistic. So, while commodity prices were 
tending to become unstable, we planned to initiate another round 
of commodity price reform, publicizing the price reform and 
propagandizing the price decontrol plan. This in turn caused 
panic among the public and encouraged a strong psychological 
expectation of price hikes among consumers. Every country which 
has had experience with the commodity economy has set great 
store by this sort of issue. Unfortunately, we were not well 
aware of it at that time. People have had too high a 
psychological expectation of price increases, whereas we, on our 
part, did not raise interest rates on deposits in good time to 
ensure the preservation of the value of savings. Consequently, a 
tide of panic purchases resulted. What was particularly 
dreadful was that this resulted in a drastic decrease in savings 
and thus a shortage of funds at bank's disposal. So banks were 
forced to issue more banknotes. I now focus on these things, 
which occurred in 1988, because I am trying to make a correct 
analysis of the factors contributing to them. Never did I mean 
to shift the blame. Anyway, I should bear the principal 
responsibility for these mistakes made in 1988. 
  By the way, I would like to mention another issue. In the 
report he delivered on behalf of the four standing committee 
members, Comrade Li Peng criticized me for encouraging party and 
government organs and service units to strive to "earn more 
income," without giving any analysis and without considering the 
objective possibility. His criticism does not tally with the 
facts. Back in the first half of last year, I did phone Comrade 
Jiang Zemin, urging Shanghai to stop the practice of allowing 
party and government organs to set up companies with a view to 
"earning more income." The report also criticized me for 
repeatedly stating that "corruption is inevitable at the initial 
stage of socialism." I just cannot remember where I made such a 
statement. Since I raised the point in Guangdong early last 
year that "party and government organs must be honest in 
performing official duties," I began to realize the importance 
of curbing corruption and promoting honesty. Since then, I have 
talked many times about the prevention of corruption and the 
promotion of honesty. I said that many countries' experience 
shows that corrupt phenomena can easily arise in the early 
period of the development of a commodity economy. But our 
country, as a socialist country, should and can minimize 
corruption to the minimum. Therefore I put forth the principle 
of "keeping the economy prosperous and promoting honesty among 
party and government organs." Of course, how to prevent 
corruption and maintain honesty is a complicated issue. 
Although the secretariat did call special meetings and forums 
to study the issue and to sum up experiences gained in some 
areas, so far we have not yet found any effective method to 
check corruption under the conditions of reform and opening up. 
If someone should be blamed for this, then, again, I should be 
the one to bear the blame. 
  IV 
  Comrades have now criticized me a lot on the issue of 
opposing bourgeois liberalization. Here, I want to tell you 
about my thoughts on this issue. 
  Since the beginning of opening, some intellectuals have 
begun 
to doubt the superiority of the socialist system and have tried 
to copy the Western system of democracy. In particular, such 
ideological trends spread among some young teachers and 
students. The seriousness of the recent student unrest is 
inseparable from such ideological trends. Over the past few 
years, the work of opposing bourgeois liberalization has not 
been effective. Efforts in party building and 
ideological-political work were relaxed. I bear a major 
responsibility for the existence of all of these problems. 
  I often considered this issue and felt that this was not a 
simple issue. We actually need to seriously study and solve the 
issue of how to effectively resist and oppose the ideological 
trend of bourgeois liberalization. It is of great importance to 
oppose the ideology of bourgeois liberalization, to strengthen 
education in the four cardinal principles, and to strengthen 
ideological and political work. I have often stressed this 
point in the past. In particular, before this, I made some 
speeches on strengthening party building, strengthening 
ideological-political work, strengthening situation education, 
and strengthening theoretical research. I also called for the 
need to use both hands to grasp work on many occasions in 
accordance with the spirit of Comrade Xiaoping's speeches. That 
is, while using one hand to grasp the work of developing the 
socialist planned commodity economy, we should also use the 
other hand to grasp work in the ideological and political 
realms. Of course, generally speaking, I still did not make 
sufficient efforts in this regard. In particular, the work did 
not achieve solid results. As Comrade Xiaoping pointed out, one 
hand was tough, but the other hand was soft. I should bear 
major responsibility for this. 
  In this period, I felt that a rather complicated issue was 
how to conduct ideological-political work and how to achieve 
more satisfactory results in this regard. I often heard that 
the old methods of education would not achieve marked results, 
and might even arouse people's repugnance. I gave much 
consideration to this issue, but failed to properly solve it. 
At the same time, I also felt that ideological education alone 
was not enough. In order to make people thoroughly understand 
which is superior, socialism or capitalism, in the final 
analysis, people should draw their own conclusions from their 
own experiences and personally feel the superiority of 
socialism. Therefore, we need to successfully carry out reform 
and rapidly develop socialist democracy according to our 
national conditions. After April 1987, Comrade Xiaoping said 
many times: "The struggle against bourgeois liberalization is a 
long-term struggle and is also a prolonged process of education. 
We cannot launch political movement, but should successfully 
carry out reform and develop the economy, thus demonstrating the 
superiority of the socialist system. Practice will convince 
people who doubt the socialist system." I completely agree with 
these viewpoints of Comrade Xiaoping. 
  Reform includes reform of the economic structure and reform 
of the political structure, which are interrelated and interact. 
It now seems that, apart from economic structural reform and 
economic development, socialism should also demonstrates its 
superiority in the political structure and in the aspect of 
democracy. In practice, I have more and more deeply realized 
that reform of the political structure can neither surpass nor 
lag economic structural reform; instead, they should basically 
advance at the same pace. If political reform lags behind, it 
is hard to carry on economic reform and various social and 
political contradictions will arise. In the past, I thought 
that as long as economic structural reform was successful and 
the economy developed, then the people's living standards would 
be enhanced and the people would be satisfied and society would 
be stable. I later found that this was not the case in reality. 
With the enhancement of the people's living standards and 
cultural attainments, they will have a stronger sense of 
political participation and will long for democracy more 
strongly. If ideological education cannot keep pace and if the 
construction of democracy and the legal system cannot keep pace, 
social stability will still not be guaranteed. Last December, I 
said at a meeting of the armed forces that facts in many 
countries show that economic development did not automatically 
make people satisfied and contented and did not automatically 
bring about social stability. I think that this raises two 
questions for us: First, it is necessary to constantly use both 
hands to grasp work and we must not neglect work in the 
ideological and political fields. Second, reform of the 
political structure must keep pace, and, in particular, 
construction of socialist democracy and the socialist legal 
system must keep pace. 
  V 
  I have no objection to the proposal to relieve me of all 
offices, as mentioned by Comrade Li Peng in his report, but I 
have reservations on the two charges of "supporting turmoil" and 
"splitting the party." 
  Actually, I expressed my different opinion on the method of 
handling the student unrest at a party meetings within the scope 
allowed by the party constitution. No matter whether my opinion 
was feasible and effective or not, my opinion was aimed at 
calming down the turmoil. I never expressed any opinion 
supporting the turmoil. 
  In reality, the expansion of the student unrest and turmoil 
could not be attributed to support from me. In fact, the 
student unrest and turmoil continued to worsen and escalate 
rapidly between 23 and 30 April. During this period, I was not 
at home. Comrade Li Peng said in his report that it was my 
speech at the ADB annual meeting which caused the turmoil to 
escalate. In fact, after my speech, colleges reported the 
resumption of classes one after another. This shows that the 
charge against me was untrue. At that time, all newspapers in 
the capital carried the same report. At least, this shows that 
my speech did not cause the escalation of student unrest. After 
martial law was enforced on 19 May, I did not perform any 
official functions and did not make any speeches. It is more 
than unreasonable to put the blame for the escalation of the 
turmoil on me. It is also unjustifiable to say that the 
development of events was caused by my absence from the meeting 
on 19 May because I asked for sick leave. 
  As for the issue of splitting the party, what is behavior of 
splitting the party? There have been precedents in the history 
of the party, and there is also a definition in the "Norms on 
Inner-Party Political Life." Our party has never regarded the 
expression of different opinions at party meetings or even the 
reservation of different opinions as behavior of splitting the 
party. 
  In their opening speeches, leaders sometimes stress 
different 
points or use different tones. This causes various comments 
among the people. Such phenomena arise frequently, and also 
cannot be called an action of splitting the party. In his 
report, Comrade Li Peng accused me of not mentioning the 26 
April editorial in my speech at the ADB meeting and also accused 
me of saying that "no major turmoil will arise in China" when 
turmoil had occurred. However, Comrade Li Peng himself also did 
not mention the 26 April editorial in his speech to the ADB the 
next day, and he also said that China would strive to "prevent 
turmoil." In my view, on different occasions, speeches may 
stress different points and use different wording. Thus, there 
may be some variance in the means of expression, and some 
improper or even erroneous way of expression may occur. 
However, all this cannot be exaggerated as "splitting the 
party." Still less can my absence from the meeting on 19 May 
after asking for sick leave be regarded as "splitting the party." 
  In addition, some institutions were called my "brain 
trusters" or my "brain trust." Because some people in these 
institutions took to the streets and took part in the 
demonstrations or gave public speeches, it seems they had 
certain relations with me. I must make it clear that there were 
no such "brain trusters" or "brain trusts." When I was working 
with the State Council, I sometimes discussed some theoretical 
economic issues with some people. People attending the 
discussion came from various institutions, and sometimes also 
from those institutions mentioned. Apart from those 
discussions, I had no connection with those institutions at all, 
and they were not directly managed by me. They had their own 
subordinate relations. It is false to call them my "brain 
trusts." This would also add unnecessary burdens to those 
institutions. 
  Since the party constitution stipulates that party members 
have the right to express their opinions on disciplinary 
measures against them, today I mainly express my appeal against 
the above-mentioned two charges against me and hope that my 
opinion will be properly considered.

3781): "Disharmony in Peace--Report From Tiananmen Square"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 4 Jun (TA KUNG PAO)--Today, the weather in 
Beijing was extremely good and people felt refreshed by the blue 
skies and a balmy breeze. 
  Tiananmen Square had a hint of a "festival" atmosphere. On 
both sides of the Tiananmen rostrum, two rows of fountains were 
spurting into the air and the national flags of China and 
Cambodia had been hung on lamp posts along both sides of Changan 
Avenue, because King Sihanouk of the Kingdom of Cambodia was 
visiting Beijing. 
<H5>  A Balmy Breeze </H5>
  People can enter and leave the square at will or buy tickets 
to climb to Tiananmen Square to look far into the distance, and 
all kinds of cars could pass along Changan Avenue without any 
restrictions. Since the weather was good and the wind strong, 
many people went to the square to fly kites, and tourists from 
other parts of the country or from foreign countries had photos 
taken as mementos in a leisurely and carefree way. If one was 
tired, one could watch quietly by the roadside near the Great 
Hall of the People or the Museum of History. 
  If there was something different, so to speak, since bygone 
days when we were wandering around the square, it was the fact 
that more policemen and police cars were markedly present at the 
center of and around the square. It was interesting that such 
an intensive deployment of the police force was shown in an open 
and natural way. 
<H5>  Relaxed and Natural </H5>
  However, viewed from the feelings and expressions of the 
common people who passed by the square, it seems that the police 
presence merely served as a reminder and did not make people 
nervous, as was revealed by the people's facial expressions, 
which were relaxed and carefree. 
  However, despite all this, the square was not peaceful, and 
some people really wanted to make trouble and provoke 
disturbances. 
  At 1600 or 1700, that is, the peak hours at which people 
leave work, four (three male and one female) foreign youths 
wearing shirts printed with the words "Beijing Foreign Language 
University" and "democratism" and "democracy, liberty" in 
English and Chinese characters on the back and front, seized the 
opportunity to swagger through the eastern side of the Tiananmen 
rostrum and were immediately brought to the attention of the 
police. When asked by the police to change their clothes, they 
all held their heads high and assumed an arrogant and 
self-satisfied posture. After being urged repeatedly by the 
police, they could not but open their bags and put on the 
ordinary clothes they had prepared in advance. As pedestrians 
gathered and looked at them, one man was humming a tune while 
chewing gum, whereas another man and woman even kissed each 
other. 
<H5>  Showing Self-Satisfaction </H5>
  When a plainclothes policeman used a camcorder to record 
them 
and the crowd of onlookers exchanged whispered comments, the 
youths even looked smug, and their complacent appearance of 
"being in the limelight" was really displeasing to others. 
  The police repeatedly advised the crowd to go away, saying 
that "there is nothing worth looking at, please go home." But 
some smiling people found it interesting and were not willing to 
go. Meanwhile, some people said while leaving the scene: "This 
group of foreigners intended to create a 
disturbance...foreigners are really ardent, they are just trying 
to ask for trouble." From listening to their tone, they did not 
buy the foreigners' "democratic favor." 
  Later, a foreign-made, mid-sized van without a number plate, 
for reasons unknown, turned left at high speed from the 
northwestern side of the Great Hall of the People and 
accelerated in a hurry. The van was closely followed by two 
police cars, which again attracted onlookers' attention. Judged 
by the model of the van, which passed in a flash, and the people 
inside, it is certain that they were also foreigners. 
<H5>  Desire To See Square Plunged Into Chaos </H5>
  Hence, it is easy to raise a question: Is there really a 
group of people who wish to see Tiananmen Square plunged into 
chaos? As far as this reporter could see, all of these people 
are actually "foreigners." 
  As a matter of fact, the common people in Beijing basically 
prefer stability to chaos. As far as this reporter could see in 
Tiananmen today, Beijing people were there to see a "peep show" 
at most.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] A plenary session of the Communist Party Central 
Committee will be held later this year to discuss ways in which 
the central authorities will regulate the embryonic market 
economy. The move confirms the recent trend that to reassert 
central control and boost social stability, the leadership is 
restoring some elements of state planning. 
  Top on the agenda of the conference, which will be the 
Fourth 
Plenum of the 14th Central Committee, will be working out 
mechanisms to ensure better state control of economic 
activities, particularly those of localities. 
  An economic source said Beijing's goals included ways to 
ensure noninflationary growth; to contain fixed-asset 
investments by local governments and enterprises; to guarantee 
proper agricultural development; and to promote enterprise 
reform without excessive privatisation. 
  And in view of the rapidly declining health of patriarch 
Deng 
Xiaoping, the Central Committee will also deliberate on measures 
to ensure political stability after his death. 
  "The Third Plenum held last November endorsed a blueprint 
for 
bol+d market reforms," the source said. "The Fourth Plenum will 
in some ways rectify the Third Plenum resolution by determining 
what the authorities must do to prevent market forces from 
exacerbating dislocations such as inflation." 
  It is expected to be called in the autumn after the 
leadership and party elders hold their annual informal meetings 
at the Beidaihe summer resort in August. 
  The Central Committee is expected to institutionalise ways 
to 
prevent localities from earmarking too much funds for 
outside-state-plan projects. Mechanisms will be put into place 
to guarantee sufficient acreage for grain and essential produce. 
  And in the course of the reform of state enterprises, 
Beijing 
will ensure that its hold on state assets will not be weakened 
and that not too many workers will become dispossessed. 
  Analysts said the theme of the forthcoming plenum dovetailed 
with the policies of President Jiang Zemin and economic tsar 
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, who believe in the need to use strong 
macrolevel measures to keep market forces within acceptable 
channels. 
  It is understood that a team of drafters under Mr Jiang and 
Mr Zhu has started work on a resolution to be passed at the 
Fourth Plenum. 
  According to a report in yesterday's edition of the 
pro-Chinese Hong Kong daily, Wen Wei Po, the plenum would be 
devoted to "the problem of management under the new system" of a 
market economy. 
  The newspaper reported that while Beijing would mainly rely 
on economic levers and legal means to regulate the economy, 
"executive means are still required under certain circumstances".

<F P=106> [Speech by Premier Li Peng at the inauguration of the </F>
Chinese Academy of Engineering and the opening of the seventh 
academicians' conference of the Chinese Academy of Sciences on 3 
June 1994] 
  [Text] Beijing, 3 Jun (XINHUA) -- Academicians and 
comrades: 
  On behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State 
Council, I hereby extend my warm congratulations on the 
inauguration of the Chinese Academy of Engineering [CAE] and the 
opening of the seventh academicians' conference of the Chinese 
Academy of Sciences [CAS]. I would like to take this 
opportunity to give my cordial regards and highest respects to 
all the academicians of the two academies and all other 
scientists and technicians across the country who have made 
outstanding contributions to China's scientific and 
technological undertakings. 
  The founding of the CAE is a major event in the engineering 
communities and is of great significance for China's socialist 
modernization drive. Engineering technology is the 
crystallization of the people's efforts to apply scientific 
theories in transforming and protecting nature. It plays an 
indispensable, important role during the course of turning 
scientific and technological achievements into practical 
productive forces. At present, engineering technology is 
progressing vigorously at an unprecedentedly high speed, showing 
its great might in promoting economic and social development. 
Since the founding of New China, the vast number of Chinese 
engineers and technicians, displaying a spirit of patriotism and 
hard struggle and striving to raise the level of engineering 
technology and enhance their designing and engineering ability, 
have built a large number of important projects and 
infrastructure and made outstanding contributions to economic 
construction and national defense. During the course of 
practical construction, China has created unique engineering 
features and strength in certain fields, and trained a large 
number of engineers and technicians. The founding of the CAE, 
with outstanding experts in the engineering communities as its 
mainstay, will have an important impact on affirming the 
contributions of engineers and technicians, improving their 
social status, arousing their enthusiasm, giving play to their 
overall strength, and stepping up the country's development of 
engineering technology. The CAE is a most honorable, 
consultative academic organ in China's engineering communities. 
I hope the CAE will work according to rules and regulations, 
and give advice and suggestions at the government's request on 
the state's major engineering projects and programs, and on 
research and studies on the development of major engineering 
technology; and that it will make active contributions to 
uniting and leading engineers and technicians across the country 
in implementing the government's policies and principles on the 
work of science and technology, and to academic exchanges and 
cooperation at home and abroad. 
  The CAS Scientific Council, the highest science and 
technology advisory organ of the state founded in 1955, has 
played an important role in formulating and implementing the 
major scientific and technological policies and plans of the 
state. To further facilitate international exchanges and embody 
the authoritative and honorary status of the CAS Scientific 
Council, the State Council has decided to rename the Scientific 
Council members academicians, while the academicians' system 
will also be carried out in the CAE. This is an important 
measure which conforms to the practice of the scientific and 
technological communities of the world, as well as the strong 
and general aspirations of the scientific and technological 
communities at home. This is the first academicians' conference 
of the CAS. However, we call it the seventh academicians' 
conference because it is the continuation of those conferences 
of the Scientific Council. During the current conference, the 
first batch of foreign academicians of the CAS will be selected, 
and they will yield a positive impact on opening China's 
scientific and technological field wider to the outside world, 
expanding international scientific and technological exchanges 
and cooperation, and promoting China's scientific and 
technological undertakings. 
  During the course of socialist modernization, we should 
always adhere to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's guiding concept that 
"science and technology is the primary productive force" and 
uphold the principle that "economic construction must rely on 
science and technology, and science and technology must meet the 
needs of economic construction." We should strive to ensure 
three rational things -- meeting the major needs of economic 
construction, developing the high-technological industries, and 
stepping up basic research. Since the start of reform and 
opening up, China's scientists and technicians have made 
remarkable achievements in tackling important scientific and 
technological problems, utilizing and popularizing the use of 
scientific and technological achievements, promoting scientific 
and technological progress in enterprises and rural areas, 
conducting high-technological research, stepping up basic 
research, and building key construction projects. Remarkable 
progress has been made in implementing the state science fund 
system and the patent system, in building high-technological 
industrial parks, in carrying out "Program 863," "the Spark 
Program," and the plans for advancing agriculture and for 
helping the poor regions through the application of science and 
technology, and in commercialization and industrialization of 
scientific research results and new technologies. Reform of the 
management system for science and technology is being deepened 
to keep pace with reform of the economic structure. Reform of 
the management system for science and technology is for the 
purpose for establishing a new system that suits the development 
of a socialist market economy, accords with the law of science 
and technology, and builds a close tie between science and 
technology and the economy; and for the purpose of promoting 
scientific and technological progress, scaling scientific and 
technological heights, and achieving a comprehensive and 
coordinated development of economy, science and technology, and 
the society. 
  At present, the trial of overall national strength based on 
economy and science and technology among countries is becoming 
more and more intense day by day. China's scientists and 
technicians are a very important force, enabling our country to 
achieve modernization and meet the challenge of international 
competition. The CAE and CAS, as the two top academic bodies of 
China's scientific and technological communities, should work 
hand in hand in close coordination to make greater contributions 
to the country's modernization drive. The academicians of the 
CAS and the CAE, as the distinguished representatives and the 
backbone of China's science and engineering communities 
shouldering a heavy responsibility, should unite and cooperate 
with one another, lead the scientists and technicians across the 
country in working hard with a will to make the country strong, 
forge ahead, strive to scale scientific and technological 
heights and surpass the advanced level of the world, and 
contribute wisdom and talents to building China into a great, 
powerful socialist country. Scientists and engineers are a 
precious wealth of our country. I hope that the party and 
government leaders at all levels will take good care of our 
scientists and engineers in terms of political treatment and 
working and living conditions, show concern for their work and 
their livelihood, and create the conditions for them to play an 
even better role. 
  I wish the conference complete success!

  [Text] Beijing, 3 Jun (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--State Council 
Vice Premier Zou Jiahua stressed at a national work meeting on 
large-scale commodity price inspections, which ended yesterday, 
that curbing inflation and bringing price rises under control is 
a policy which the government must uphold for a long time to 
come and involves the current overall situation of the country. 
  Zou Jiahua said: Stable commodity prices are an important 
condition of economic and social stability. Although the trend 
of rising prices has tended to slow down recently, curbing 
inflation, keeping the market stable, and holding down commodity 
prices is still a key link in properly handling the relationship 
between reform, development, and stability. 
  When talking about how to handle the relationship between 
deepening price reform and strengthening price administration, 
Zou Jiahua said: The question is how to comprehend price 
reform. Some people say that to reform prices is precisely to 
lift restrictions on prices, and once restrictions are lifted, 
the task of reform is fulfilled, the government need not 
regulate prices, and producers and traders can set prices at 
will. This is a misunderstanding of price reform. Price reform 
has a clear definition and demands. In brief, it is precisely 
to transform the mechanism of price formation and establish a 
price mechanism with market prices at the core, straighten out 
the price system and establish price relations which can 
distribute resources in a rational manner, and reform the 
traditional system of price administration and establish and 
perfect a system of price regulation with indirect governmental 
administration at the core. All these are interrelated and 
complement each other. They constitute the overall objective of 
price reform and are also the main contents of price reform. In 
order to realize this objective, we must uphold the policy of 
integrating "regulation, lifting restrictions, and control" into 
a single whole. We must maintain price controls while 
regulating prices and lifting restrictions on prices in such a 
way that lifting restrictions will not bring about chaos and 
price control will not be too rigid. In regulating prices and 
lifting restrictions on prices, we must also take different 
reform measures according to different commodities and the 
nature of different services and conditions. Even if the task 
of price reform is fulfilled, the state must still administer, 
in different forms, prices of monopolistic and welfare-oriented 
commodities and services rather than let things slide. In 
reality, this is also the case in many developed countries who 
pursue a market economy. 
  In order to implement the massive inspection of commodity 
prices in a more profound way, members of the State Council 
Commodity Price Inspection Working Group will again go 
separately to various provinces (autonomous regions and 
municipalities) in the middle of June to supervise and direct 
work and to bring the plans set out at this meeting into effect.

<F P=106> [By Jiang Chun (3068 3196)] </F>
  [Text] The provincial government general office recently 
issued a circular outlining the plan for this year's work of 
redressing irregularities in various trades in Anhui. 
  To ensure continuous deepening reform in Anhui, the circular 
called on all localities to carry out the plan made by the 
provincial party committee and government, foster a fine 
workstyle in various trades, and give special attention to 
solving hot-point issues that have caused strong complaints in 
society. 
  The circular pointed out that this year's work of redressing 
irregularities in various trades would focus on the following 
aspects: conscientiously screening party and government organs 
and their personnel to check if they have taken advantage of 
their position to use enterprises' vehicles, computers, or 
communications equipment, and if they transfer enterprises' 
funds to their own units' "small banks" for private use under 
any excuse; screening party, government, and administrative 
organs to see if they set up "small banks" in their units; 
continuing to pay attention to unauthorized fees; and resolutely 
canceling unreasonable fees to alleviate the burden of 
enterprises and the masses. In fostering a fine workstyle in 
various trades, localities must continue to screen checkpoints 
and fee collection stations along highways and rivers, adjust 
the structure of electricity charges in rural areas, and 
consolidate achievements scored in the past. 
  The circular urged governments at all levels to 
conscientiously strengthen leadership in redressing 
irregularities in various trades, regard this issue as an 
important task against corruption and promoting a clean 
government and place it high on the agenda, pay attention to key 
enterprises and units, gradually establish and perfect various 
regulations and laws, and strictly investigate and prosecute 
cases in violation of laws and discipline to create a sound 
social environment for reform and opening up in Anhui.

  [Text] The director of China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office, Lu Ping, has told a top-level delegation from Hong Kong 
that the territory's unique economic position is important not 
only to maintain the territory's stability and prosperity, but 
also to help the overall development of China's economy. He was 
talking to an economic mission headed by Trade Development 
Council (TDC) chairman Victor Fung, which yesterday met Chinese 
officials in Beijing to discuss strengthening economic ties. 
  Mr Lu urged all provinces and major cities on the mainland 
to 
help protect Hong Kong's economic system and to take advantage 
of the territory's position for expanding international trade. 
Mr Lu said the TDC had done much in fostering closer economic 
ties with the mainland, which should be strengthened further. 
  At a meeting with Minister of Internal Trade Zhang Haoruo, 
Mr 
Fung said Hong Kong companies wanted to expand further in China 
and hoped to broaden their scope of operation into China's 
distribution system. Mr Zhang said China would continue to do 
its best to conform to international practices as it developed 
its internal commerce. 
  The mission also met Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation Zheng Silin. They discussed issues facing 
China in its application to re-enter GATT and the subjects of 
anti-dumping legislation and protectionism in major markets. 
  The mission was part of Hong Kong's participation in the 
Asia 
Pacific International Trade Fair in Beijing, to which the TDC 
has sent a delegation representing 118 Hong Kong companies.

<F P=106> [By Xu Yang: "Leaders Urge Talks to Solve Nuke Crisis"] </F>
  [Text] Talks between top Chinese leaders and the visiting 
Maltese Premier Edward Fenech Adami yesterday in Beijing focused 
on the strengthening of ties and the sharing of views about the 
nuclear issue in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
(DPRK). 
  China and Malta enjoy close bilateral ties and the prospect 
of such ties are bright, President Jiang Zemin told Fenech Adami. 
  Shortly before the meeting of the two top leaders, Chinese 
Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks with 
his Maltese counterpart Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Guido 
De Marco at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. 
  Qian told De Marco that China opposes resorting to sanctions 
in the nuclear inspection issue of the DPRK. 
  He said that, China has not changed its position of solving 
the problem through negotiations among the four parties 
involved: DPRK, the Republic of Korea, the United States and 
the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  "Sanctions are not a sensible choice, as they would only 
aggravate the crisis," Qian noted. 
  He added that China holds that efforts should be made to 
maintain peace and stability and achieve denuclearization on the 
Korean Peninsula. 
  Qian expressed his support for Malta's application to join 
the European Union as a member of the European family. 
  He also said that, compared with Europe, the Asia-Pacific 
region has felt less impact from the ending of the Cold War. 
  De Marco agreed with Qian on the need to settle 
international 
disputes, including the Korean issue, through peaceful talks. 
  He said his country believes that China, as a permanent 
member of the United Nations Security Council, can perform a 
substantial role in the international community and the 
Asia-Pacific region in particular. 
  It was China that first proposed the establishment of a new 
global political and economical order, De Marco said, adding 
that Malta also regards it as a very important issue. 
  During the meeting between President Jiang and Premier Adami 
later at Zhongnanhai, headquarters of the Chinese government, 
the Maltese leader was told that his visit will help to bring 
mutual relations to a new high. 
  Productive results have been achieved since diplomatic 
relations were built up between the two countries in 1972, Jiang 
said. 
  The reciprocal visits of both countries' top leaders have 
reinforced the friendly link between the two countries, Jiang 
said. He added that mutual economic and trade co-operations so 
far are also fruitful. 
  "We are Working together to seek new frontiers of further 
collaboration in economy and trade," Jiang told Adami. 
  Past experience has proved, Jiang stressed, that both big 
and 
small countries, regardless of their differences in social 
systems, can co-exist peacefully and co-operate beneficially on 
the basis of mutual respect.

  [Text] Beijing, June 7 (XINHUA) -- The fifth Asia-Pacific 
International Trade Fair (ASPAT '94) opened at the China 
International Exhibition Center (CIEC) here this morning. 
  Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing, executive secretary of the 
United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the 
Pacific (UN-ESCAP) Rafeeudin Ahmed, and chairman of the China 
Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) Zheng 
Hongye were present at the opening ceremony of the fair, which 
is co-sponsored by CCPIT and UN-ESCAP. 
  The 80,000-square-meter exhibition includes about 3,000 
participants from 30 countries and regions such as China, 
Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Germany, 
India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Philippines, Russia and 
the United States. 
  Exhibits display light industrial products, mechanical 
equipment, electronics technology, communications equipment and 
products, environmental protection facilities, high-tech and 
patented products, jewelry, ornaments, garments, traditional 
handicrafts, and real estate projects. 
  During the fair, five symposiums will also be held on the 
electronics trade, China's current economic situation and 
investment environment, China's reform of its foreign trade 
system and investment policies, and China's financial and 
taxation reforms. 
  The Philippines and Hong Kong have sent large trade 
delegations to the fair to conduct business talks. 
  ASPAT '94 is aimed at demonstrating economic achievements in 
the region, highlighting economic and trade complementarity and 
potential, promoting economic development and cooperation 
throughout the Asia-Pacific region and with other countries in 
the world, and exploring ways for strengthening cooperation and 
jointly achieving prosperity among the Asia-Pacific countries in 
a new world situation. 
  ASPAT was first proposed in 1962 by the United Nations Asia 
and Far East Economic Commission, which is the present UN-ESCAP. 
  The first three ASPAT fairs were held in 1966, 1969 and 1972 
in Thailand, Iran and India, and proved to be fruitful. The 
fourth ASPAT fair, which was held in Beijing in 1985, was also a 
complete success.

  [Text] Jakarta, June 7 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese official said 
here today that China is ready to work together with all other 
countries in the Asia Pacific region to make the second Asian 
and Pacific ministerial conference on women in development a 
success. 
  Xu Zhijian, deputy secretary-general of the State Council of 
the Peoples Republic of China, made the remark in the Chinese 
delegation's statement presented here this afternoon. He 
recalled that the region has made remarkable progress in women's 
affairs, in improving women's social status, etc. However, 
because of differences among countries in social development, 
historic and cultural background, continued efforts are needed 
in this field of work. 
  He noted that the plan of action to be adopted by this 
conference should reflect in full sense the common aspiration 
and requirements of women in Asia Pacific. 
  Toward this end, the Chinese delegation has put forward five 
proposals: 
  First, to take more vigorous measures to help most of over 
30 
million impoverished women in Asia out of poverty by 2000; 
  Second, since education is of great significance, China 
appeals to the countries in the region to eliminate illiteracy 
among young and middle-aged women and provide more opportunities 
for women to receive vocational and technical training; 
  Third, to increase the proportion of women taking part in 
decision-making and management; 
  Fourth, to protect women's rights and interests by 
legislation and law-enforcement, to do away with all form of 
discrimination against women and to promote equality between men 
and women; 
  Fifth, to encourage women to contribute to and play a 
greater 
role in maintaining social stability in their respective 
countries, promoting intra-regional cooperation and exchanges 
and championing peace in the region and in the world at large. 
  He pointed out that China is convinced that with the efforts 
from all the participants, this conference will adopt a plan of 
action which can help resolve the major issues facing 
Asian-Pacific women and contribute to the preparation and 
convocation of the 4th World Conference on Women to be held in 
Beijing, China, in September next year. 
  Senior officials from 47 countries of the Asian and Pacific 
region gathered here today to begin the senior officials meeting 
from June 7 to 11. The ministerial conference on women in 
development will be held from June 13 to 14. 
  A 38-member strong Chinese delegation led by Chen Muhua, 
vice 
chairman of the National People's Congress and chairman of the 
All- China Women's Federation, arrived here on June 5 to take 
part in the senior officials meeting and ministerial conference.

  [Text] Moscow, June 8 (XINHUA) -- Russia today lodged a 
protest with the U.S. Government against the violation of its 
air sovereignty by a U.S. civilian aircraft yesterday. 
  Russia's First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin 
summoned U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering today delivering a 
statement of the Russian Government on the violation. 
  A U.S. Lockheed C-130 plane, on its way from Frankfurt of 
Germany to Tbilisi of Georgia, penetrated Russia's air space 
over the Black Sea town of Adler at 13:54 Moscow time Tuesday, 
without making any application in advance, the ITAR-TASS NEWS 
SERVICE said. 
  After the plane ignored warnings from Russian ground 
stations 
and flew 80 kilometers deep into the Russian space, Russian 
military aircraft took off and forced it to land at the Adler 
airport at 14:10. 
  The Russian statement said Russia wishes the U.S. side would 
take all measures necessary to prevent the reoccurrence of such 
incidents. 
  The U.S. ambassador expressed gratitude for Russia's 
restraint in handling the incident.

<F P=106> ["International Forum" column article by Gu Ping (0657 </F>
1627): "A Chat Commencing With Change of Targets of Nuclear 
Warheads"] 
  [Text] Russia and the United States have recently 
announced that beginning 30 and 31 May, the strategic nuclear 
warheads in the two countries will aim at the seas instead of 
aiming at each other. A similar measure has also been taken 
between Britain and Russia. Meanwhile, the Russian and American 
armed forces have arranged a joint military exercise for the 
first time in early July, however, although only 500 soldiers 
will be involved, the details have yet to be worked out. In 
light of the sensitive discussions by the Russian press 
regarding the areas along the Volga as the site of the exercise, 
several American senators have suggested that the site of the 
exercise should be changed to a U.S. military base, and now the 
two sides are discussing the matter. 
  Both issues have symbolic significance. The former signifies 
an "end to the era of viewing each other as nuclear opponents" 
between the two countries; the latter indicates that although 
Russia and the United States are no longer "nuclear opponents," 
it is not easy to build a new relationship in concrete terms. 
These two matters quite clearly reflect the current situation 
of the Russian-U.S. relations. 
  After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Russian-U.S. 
relations once became very "hot," and the press in the West 
called the situation a "honeymoon" in Russian-U.S. relations, 
holding that this was a "romantic period" after the two 
countries experienced a cold war and confrontation for more than 
four decades. Since the end of last year, difficulties in 
relations between the two countries have begun to increase. In 
February this year, Russia acted alone to intervene in the 
Sarajevo crisis, using vigorous political mediation to get rid 
of NATO's air strike plan, thus, ending the "honeymoon" period 
in Russian-U.S. relations. It seems that the relations between 
the two countries are changing into a new phase. 
  There are many reasons for Russian-U.S. relations to change 
from "honeymoon" to a condition of cooperation on the one hand 
and competition on the other. One important reason is that 
although the ideological factor which played a vital role in the 
Soviet-U.S. relations in the past no longer exists, the 
geopolitical interests of Russia and the United States, the two 
big powers in the world, remain unchanged, and to a great extent 
this determines the basic orientation of Russian-U.S. relations. 
National interests, the status of a big country, and influence 
on the world have already become the foundation stone of 
Russia's diplomatic strategy. It seems that the United States 
has not abandoned the "restraining strategy" it once used in the 
past. The suspicious and precautionary mentality in the 
relations between the two countries still exists. 
  Judged from a certain stance, changing the targets of 
nuclear 
warheads to the high seas also vividly reflects a new pattern of 
relations between the major powers after the cold war: Gone are 
the days when a clear line between friends and foes could be 
drawn and confrontation between groups could be seen. A new 
picture, more complicated and characterized by a condition in 
which one is neither friend nor foe or both friend and foe, has 
emerged. Proceeding from their own basic interests, Russia, the 
United States, and other major Western powers attack, defend, 
charge, and retreat in the big chess board of international 
politics, and maneuver among various political groupings, to 
strive for a better position in the emerging new world pattern.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Wang Nan: "U.S., Japan Seek Partial Trade </F>
Accords"] 
  [Text] Washington, June 7 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. and Japan, 
after another a year of wrangling over Washington's widening 
trade gap with Tokyo, appeared ready to settle for partial and 
less ambitious trade agreements. 
  The agreements, according to observers here, are expected to 
be sealed in the areas of insurance and government procurement, 
including telecommunications and medical equipment, in as soon 
as a month. 
  Although they will do little to reverse the increasing U.S. 
wealth flow to Japan, the agreements will surely be greeted with 
relief by the group of seven leaders at their July meeting in 
Naples, Italy. 
  This is despite the fact that no progress has been seen in 
the areas of auto and auto parts, which represent two thirds of 
the U.S. trade deficit with Japan, totaling 60 billion U.S. 
dollars last year. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and Undersecretary 
of 
Commerce Jeffrey Garten, speaking on Monday [6 June] 
respectively in Paris and Tokyo, stressed that Washington was 
ready for "realistic" trade agreements with Tokyo. 
  The U.S.-Japan trade framework talks, which began in July, 
collapsed on February 11, when President Clinton, in his meeting 
with then Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa, refused to accept 
partial agreements. 
  At that time, sources said, agreements on insurance and 
telecommunications and medical equipment were already within 
reach, despite the stalemate in auto and auto parts. 
  Soon after the failure, to the dismay of the recovering U.S. 
economy, came turmoil in the U.S. currency and bond markets, 
with the rise of U.S. dollar against Japanese yen and the 
climbing of interest rates. 
  In Japan, support for the government's refusal to back up 
and 
to say "no" to Washington, for the first time in history as some 
reports said, remained strong among the Japanese public and in 
business circles. 
  To the other parts of Asia and the European Union, which 
have 
their own trade disputes with the U.S., Washington's tough stand 
with Japan has been viewed negatively. 
  Inside the beltway, some of the Clinton advisers stressed 
that the country should not let its trade disputes dominate its 
economic relations with Japan, viewed as Washington's most 
important tie in the post-Cold War era. 
  Instead, they said, Washington should try its utmost to make 
Japan cut taxes and stimulate domestic consumption, and 
therefore increase general imports. 
  In a compromise with Japan late May, Washington gave up its 
insistence on using "numerical targets" to measure Japan's 
market opening progress, and stressed that it never intended to 
control trade. 
  "We are not going to wait to open up everything until we 
make 
deals in all sectors," Mickey Kantor told reporters on Monday. 
"If you are ready to reach agreement on a particular sector, you 
should go ahead and finalize that." 
  In Tokyo, Undersecretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten, 
speaking 
to reporters, cited "considerable hope" in the talks in the 
areas of telecommunications, saying that solid progress has been 
made over the weekend.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Cooperation With China Is World Trend"] </F>
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton has announced the 
separation of human rights from trade and the unconditional 
renewal of China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status, 
which shows an adjustment of U.S. policy toward China. This is 
the trend of the times and the desire of the people. Although 
Sino-U.S. relations are still full of contradictions and 
maintaining the improving trend requires effort, this is an 
important step. In particular, the U.S. Government has 
recognized the importance of cooperating with China and has 
realized that linking human rights to trade will lead itself 
into a dead end; regarding this point, it is praiseworthy. 
  In the international community today, some major economic 
powers are particularly willing to become partners in 
cooperation with China to develop economic and trade relations, 
and this has already become a world trend. Please look at the 
following: 
  Japan: Entrepreneurial circles have a strong desire to 
strengthen Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, and a China fever 
is sweeping across the Japanese islands. Last year, 
Sino-Japanese economic and trade relations created three 
first's, that is, Sino- Japanese trade volume set records and 
Japan ranked first among China's trade partners, Japan's exports 
of technology to China ranked first among China's technology 
imports, and the realization rate of capital invested in China 
by Japanese entrepreneurs also ranked first. 
  Germany: With Chancellor Kohl's China visit last October as 
a landmark, Sino-German relations entered a new period of 
thorough development, and many large enterprises marched toward 
the Chinese market like an army, with Germany becoming China's 
largest trade partner in Europe. Kohl said Germany was willing 
to become China's "real partner" and hoped that relations 
between the two countries would "resemble ever-flowing steams 
and rivers." 
  France: Owing to arms sales to Taiwan by the French 
Government, Sino-French relations were hurt. After going 
through some twists and turns, the French Government changed its 
mind and took the initiative to mend ties with China. In April 
this year, Prime Minister Balladur visited China and said he 
wanted to "open a new chapter on Sino-French relations." After 
the leaders of the two governments held summits, a joint 
communique on the restoration of relations was issued, and, 
since then, relations between the two countries have entered the 
track of normal development. 
  Russia: Earlier this year, Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
proposed building a "constructive partnership" with China. Not 
long ago, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin visited China, the two 
countries signed seven agreements involving many areas, and 
bilateral relations took a big step forward. 
  Some big powers have one after another adjusted their China 
policies, and this can be regarded as the result of a re- 
interpretation of China by those governments. Whether they are 
willing or unwilling, politicians in Western countries, 
including the United States, must admit: first, China is a 
giant, and no pressures or sanctions of any kind can have an 
impact on it; second, China has the fastest economic growth in 
the world and has a great impact on the world's economic 
development; third, China is a market with great potential and 
is opening to every trade partner, who now find it provides the 
best opportunity to enter the Chinese market and develop their 
own economy. If a country looks down on China or even confronts 
China, the one which will be hurt is not China but itself. The 
French prime minister openly admitted that he had neglected the 
development of the Asia region in the past and had now 
discovered the consequence of such negligence, and that from now 
on, he must pay special attention to China's development and 
strengthen cooperation with China. The French foreign minister 
also said that France "regrets the quarrel with China caused by 
the matter of arms sales to Taiwan," and asked "should we bet on 
a region of 20 million people or a country which has 1.1 billion 
people and is probably the world's third largest economic power? 
To us, the choice is very obvious." 
  Economic factors are the determining factors about whether a 
regime can be consolidated and whether society can develop. If 
a country's politicians do not look at the economy, do not put 
economic development in the first position, and do not consider 
their country's long-term interests, they will lead their 
country into decline and chaos and they will be abandoned by the 
people. The contemporary Western world generally faces economic 
depression, and it must put economic factors in pole position 
when handling international relations to cast off this difficult 
situation. This is an important reason why some of the major 
powers are seeking cooperation with China. 
  There is also another point, that is, more Western countries 
feel that it is not feasible to deal with China by exerting 
pressure on it or imposing economic sanctions against it in 
order to achieve political aims. The United States has even 
failed to score results by imposing sanctions against some small 
countries, let alone China, which has 1.1 billion people! In 
the 1950's, armed intervention and economic blockade by the 
United States failed to bring China to its knees; after "4 
June," the United States joined hands with some Western 
countries to impose economic sanctions against China, but failed 
to make China lower its head; in recent years, the United States 
has waved the human rights stick but has failed to scare China. 
Clinton linked human rights to MFN status and was strongly 
opposed by various circles, especially commercial circles in the 
United States; therefore, he could not but admit that the effect 
of linking the two had vanished. 
  In handling relations with China, even France and the United 
States have bowed their heads to reality and to economics; they 
have rid themselves of erroneous ideas of their own and have 
made choices which conform to their long-term interests and to 
the world trend, and this cannot but deal a blow to the British 
Government, which continues to insist on confronting China. Up 
to now, Britain still hopes to see turmoil emerging in China, 
hopes to use the human rights stick to scare China, and hopes to 
see its allies and the United Nations exert political pressure 
on China so that it can achieve its goal of extending its 
colonial interests in Hong Kong; this is really absurd. We can 
certainly say that in Hong Kong, while the British side is 
staking its chips on a small handful of pro-British elements who 
are trying to cause chaos in Hong Kong, it is doomed to failure.

  [Text] Beijing, 8 Jun (XINHUA) -- The China Society for 
Human Rights Studies [zhong guo ren quan yan jiu hui 0022 0948 
0086 2938 4282 4496 2585] today published a long article 
pointing out that, in the U.S. State Department's human rights 
report for 1993, the part on China is not earnest, is unfair, 
and lacks objectivity; and it is fundamentally based on rumor 
and subjective conjecture. 
  In the U.S. State Department report on human rights for 1993 
published on 1 February this year, the U.S. Government 
criticized China for having so-called "extensive... [ellipses as 
received] trampling down on human rights." In this respect, the 
China Society for Human Rights Studies, which is a 
non-government academic organization, spent more than three 
months investigating and checking up on related people and 
events mentioned in the U.S. human rights report, and wrote an 
article entitled: "Commenting on the U.S. State Department's 
Human Rights Report on China." Using factual material and 
objective analysis, the article refutes the U.S. State 
Department's criticism of China's human rights situation. 
  The article is composed of four parts. The first deals with 
the U.S. Government's dual criteria on the issue of human 
rights; the second exposes the U.S. human rights report's 
self-contradictory nature and fabricated charges; the third 
comments on the groundless criticism against China in the U.S. 
report; and the fourth points out that the report only attacks 
certain things and disregards the overall situation. 
  Citing a series of facts, the article points out that the 
U.S. State Department's human rights report (hereafter "report") 
uses dual criteria on the issue of human rights. For example, 
the "report" devotes extensive space to attacks on China's 
arrest and imprisonment of counterrevolutionary criminals. 
According to China's Criminal Law, the crime of 
counterrevolution actually refers to any acts which endanger 
state security. In the world today, every sovereign state 
enacts strict laws to deal with criminal activities that 
endanger state security and society. For example, the "United 
States Code" explicitly prohibits rebellion, revolt, rioting, 
instigating riots or advocating the overthrow of the government. 
Article 2383 of the "United States Code" under the heading 
"Rebellion or Insurrection," stipulates: "Whoever incites, 
carries out, assists or engages in rebellion or insurrection 
against the authorities of the United States or the law, or 
gives aid or support to the above-mentioned acts shall be fined 
not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than 10 years, 
or both, and shall be incapable of holding any office in the 
United States." Article 2385 of the "United States Code" 
stipulates: "Whoever knowingly or willfully advocates, abets, 
or advises the overthrow of the United States Government" shall 
be imprisoned for a period of not more than 20 years. The 
article points out: Since the United States enacts strict 
punishment against anti government activities, what right does 
the U.S. State Department's "report" have to charge China with 
punishing criminals who endanger state security? 
  On the accusation of China's "indiscriminate and wanton 
arrests" and "maltreatment of criminals" in the "report," the 
article points out that according to statistics, the proportion 
of imprisoned criminals in China in 1993 was only 103 per 
100,000 of the total population, while that in the United States 
was 455 per 100,000. China has used prisons as schools to 
reform criminals. As a result, the rate of released prisoners 
going back to crimes is only six to eight percent, while that in 
the United States is above 40 percent. China has been a 
longtime signatory to the "Convention on Banning Tortures and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment," 
adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1984, which the United 
States has yet to join. 
  On the reported accusation that China discriminates against 
women, the article points out that achieving the goal of full 
equality between men and women still requires tremendous efforts 
by various countries of the world. In this regard, China too, 
still has many shortcomings. But a comparison between China and 
the United States reveals that Chinese women enjoy far better 
status and rights than their American counterparts. The article 
says that the United States has not joined the "Convention on 
Eliminating All Forms of Discrimination Against Women," adopted 
by the UN General Assembly in 1979, while China has already 
joined. From 1990 to 1993, the proportion of women deputies to 
people's congresses at various levels in China exceeded 20 
percent, while in the United States, the proportion of women 
members at legislatures of various levels was only 18.4 percent 
in 1992, the "Year of Congresswomen." According to a survey 
among urban Chinese workers and staff members, the average 
income for women employees was 77.4 percent that of their male 
counterparts, while the income of rural women was 81.4 percent 
that of men. On comparison, wages of American women constituted 
only 51 percent that of their male counterparts. In 1992, the 
proportion of Chinese female undergraduates and postgraduates 
accounted for 33.7 percent and 24.8 percent of the total 
respectively, while the total number of female graduates 
majoring in engineering stood at 27 percent, a figure much 
higher than that of 15 percent in the United States. In 1993, 
China had nearly 8.1 million women scientific and technological 
personnel, or 35 percent of the total number. The rate was much 
higher than the 12.2 percent in the United States for the 
corresponding period. 
  The article points out that the description of China in the 
"report" as a country where the life and safety of the people 
cannot be guaranteed is untrue. It says that the Chinese 
people's living standards continue to improve, and their lives 
and safety are guaranteed. However, in the United States, the 
world's richest country, the lives and safety of many people are 
being threatened. On 20 January this year, the eastern part of 
the United States was hit by a severe blizzard, with 
temperatures plunging to 20 degrees Centigrade below zero. 
According to a UNITED PRESS [INTERNATIONAL] report on 21 
January, more than 130 people froze to death in Washington D.C. 
alone. Harbin, a city with a population of several millions in 
a developing country like China, was unusually cold this year 
with the temperature dropping to 34.5 degrees Centigrade below 
zero on 5 January. Yet, no one froze to death in the city 
throughout the entire winter. 
  The article says the tragedy involving the freezing to death 
of more than 130 people in the capital of the United States 
occurred on 21 January. Yet, the U.S. State Department 
published the "Human Rights Report" 10 days later, criticizing 
and accusing human rights situations in China and many other 
countries. This is truly a very great irony. 
  Citing a host of facts, the article exposes one by one the 
parts in the U.S. human rights report which are 
self-contradictory, which contain framed-up charges, and which 
do not conform to facts. 
  The article points out: In scientifically assessing the 
human rights situation of a country, one should not solely focus 
on isolated incidents or a small number of people in disregard 
of the overwhelming majority of the people; one should not limit 
oneself to a single incident at a given time; instead, one 
should make a general assessment on the basis of objective 
viewpoint, historical perspective, and in the light of 
development. The article says: At present, no country in the 
world can claim its human rights situation is perfect. The key 
to the question is to view a country's human rights situation as 
a whole, as well as its trend of historical development. 
China's human rights situation should also be viewed on this 
basis. However, the U.S. State Department report makes a 
comprehensive assessment of China by focussing isolated, trifle, 
or temporary issues. In China this is often referred to as 
attacking somebody for a single fault without considering his 
other qualities. To be just, since the People's Republic of 
China's founding in 1949, the Chinese people have become the 
masters of their country after freeing themselves from the 
situation in which they could be bullied and slaughtered at will 
and in which human rights did not exist at all. In the past 
four decades since the founding of New China, particularly in 
the past ten years or so, the nearly 1.2 billion Chinese people 
have basically solved the problem of having adequate food and 
clothing and are beginning to work toward a comfortable standard 
of living. Their days are gradually getting better. Throughout 
the country, a situation has appeared where there is political 
stability, economic development, and people live and work in 
peace and contentment. In 1993, China's domestic gross product 
topped 3 trillion yuan, and the country's average amount of 
per-capita income that city dwellers used for living expenses 
increased 10.2 percent over 1992. Along with this, there has 
been a big improvement in the Chinese people's human rights 
situation, and progress is being made continually. China is 
vigorously striving to improve socialist democracy and the legal 
system. Since 1979, it has promulgated many basic laws, 
including the Criminal Law, the Criminal Procedure Law, the 
General Rules of Civil Law, the Civil Procedure Law, and the 
Administrative Procedure Law. There are over 1,000 laws on 
human rights enacted by the central and provincial authorities. 
Law-enforcing organs always enforce laws strictly; supervisory 
and procuratorial organs promptly correct the erroneous acts of 
some law-enforcing personnel; mass organizations seriously take 
part in supervision; the people have various means to file their 
appeals; and the mass media are playing the supervisory role.... 
[ellipses as received] China has made marked achievement in 
safeguarding human rights. This is universally recognized. 
  The article points out: The U.S. State Department's human 
rights report has not made an objective and impartial appraisal 
of these basic facts and good development trend. Instead, it 
makes accusations of China with hodgepodge materials based on 
hearsay, and is particularly based on slanders made by a handful 
of people who attempt to subvert the Chinese Government and 
overthrow China's socialist system. 
  The article says: Human rights are an issue which people all 
over the world are concerned about. Enjoying human rights fully 
is the common ideal and objective of the people in the world. 
The "United Nations Charter" attaches great importance to human 
rights issues. Article 2 of the "Charter" unequivocally 
stipulates the principles which all member states should uphold. 
One of them is the "principle of sovereignty equality of all 
its members." Another principle is "not to intervene in matters 
which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any 
state." The U.S. Government, considering itself to be a "world 
judge for human rights," publishes reports on its examination of 
other countries' human rights situations year after year and 
criticizes the political, economic, social, cultural, and 
judicial systems of other countries. In doing so, it violates 
the spirit of the "United Nations Charter" and adds more factors 
of instability to the world which has already lacked 
tranquility. Of course, such a report evokes criticism and 
condemnation from many countries. 
  In conclusion, the article says: Because of their different 
historical, cultural, social, and national conditions, different 
countries always hold different viewpoints on human rights. 
Members of the international community should conduct dialogue 
on the basis of equality, carry out international cooperation, 
and seek common ground while reserving differences. Only in 
this way can they benefit the protection and improvement of 
human rights in the world. The China Society for Human Rights 
Studies is opposed to hegemonic practices which impose 
viewpoints on others and uses the human rights issue as a 
pretext to interfere with other's internal affairs and to exert 
pressure on others.

<F P=106> ["International Forum" column article by Gu Ping (0657 </F>
1627): "Bumping Against the Wall and Not Turning Around"] 
  [Text] A popular Chinese saying goes, "one will never turn 
around until one bumps against the wall." But now this saying 
is no longer applicable to U.S. congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, 
because she has already bumped against the wall but still will 
not turn around. 
  Under the pretext of "human rights," Miss Pelosi has made 
arbitrary attacks on China over the past few years, and kept 
babbling about advocating so-called "trade sanctions." 
Proceeding from U.S. basic interests, the Clinton 
Administration has recently announced its decision to extend MFN 
trade status to China and delink MFN trade status from the 
human-rights issue to go along with the strong demand of U.S. 
figures of various circles and the public. That was a wise 
action. However, Pelosi would not admit defeat and attacked the 
White House decision from nowhere; in addition, she set out in 
the U.S. Congress the need to take sanction action against 
China. She threatened: "We have grounds, and will get great 
support in the Congress." 
  Does Pelosi really "have grounds"? No. Everyone knows that 
China and the United States grant each other the MFN trade 
status according to the bilateral agreement on trade and 
economic relations; that is entirely an arrangement beneficial 
to both sides on an equal footing, and the foundation for normal 
trade between the two countries. Over the past few years, the 
United States has jeopardized Sino-U.S. relations by setting out 
some side issues on MFN trade status, that were likened to 
weaving a cocoon and get imprisoned to it. The peoples of the 
two countries were unhappy about it. That being the case, the 
aforementioned decision of the Clinton Administration has not 
only won China's welcome but also the admiration of various 
circles in the United States and world public opinion. This has 
precisely demonstrated the practice of Pelosi and her like is 
totally groundless. 
  As for the "great support," Pelosi might not even believe it 
herself. Long before the Clinton Administration made that 
decision, a common understanding on delinking human rights from 
trade issue and improving and developing Sino-U.S. relations had 
taken shape in the U.S. Government and the public, from the top 
to the grass roots on an extensive scale. Aside from U.S. 
business and public opinion circles, there are an increasingly 
greater number of people of insight inside the U.S. Congress who 
once supported Pelosi, who are for improving and augmenting 
Sino-U.S. relations, believing that this conforms to U.S. 
strategic and economic interests, and is favorable to peace and 
stability the Asia-Pacific Region and the world. Democrat 
Senator Johnston indicated that U.S.-Chinese relations are "the 
most important in all bilateral relations in the world," 
canceling the MFN trade status to China would seriously 
jeopardize bilateral economic relations and trade and even 
political relations. The majority of the Senate was for 
changing the policy, and 106 House members from both political 
parties had jointly written a letter to the White House urging 
extension of MFN trade status to China. Could it be that Miss 
Pelosi has turned a deaf ear to the words of her fellow 
congressmen? People would like to see just what "great support" 
Miss Pelosi will get! 
  Congresswoman Pelosi has never stopped talking about "human 
rights." If she really cares for the human rights issue as she 
claims herself, why should she have taken the trouble to find 
such an issue in China or some other parts in the world? Miss 
Pelosi has only to stand at the door of her own house and she 
will find it. Several years back, racial turmoil on the largest 
scale in U.S. history took place in Los Angeles, California, the 
very state from which she has been elected a congresswoman. Was 
that not plainly a human-rights issue? The LOS ANGELES TIMES 
disclosed not long ago, some elderly American Chinese residing 
on Vallejo Street in San Francisco, who were impoverished and 
weak, suffered greatly from street crime, and dared not leave 
their living quarters, "their human rights are violated every 
day," and "there is no way to protect them" ... Has Miss Pelosi 
ever exerted any efforts on that issue? If Miss Pelosi has any 
shame about it, she should mind less about other countries' 
matters, and say less about things that she is ignorant of. She 
should instead exert some effort to improve the human rights 
condition in California to live up to the expectations of her 
California constituents. 
  Not long ago, President Clinton said: "Linking human rights 
to the MFN trade status has taken us to the end of a path." 
However, should a small handful of people like Pelosi insist on 
moving on when they have arrived at the end of the path, what a 
scenario that will be?!

  [Text] Beijing, June 8 (YONHAP) -- China and North Korea 
reaffirmed their alliance Tuesday and vowed bilateral efforts to 
strengthen their ties at a high-level meeting here Tuesday, 
China's official XINHUA News Agency reported. 
  XINHUA, however, did not say whether the North Korean 
nuclear 
crisis, which has escalated into an international controversy, 
was mentioned in the meeting. 
  President Jiang Zemin received a visit by a North Korean 
military delegation, led by Chief of General Staff of the 
People's Army Choe Kwang, at his office and described 
Beijing-Pyongyang ties as "interdependent, like teeth and lips," 
according to XINHUA. 
  Strengthening and developing the bilateral friendship 
remains 
a firm policy of the Chinese party and Government and the wish 
of the party and the people, Jiang was quoted as saying. 
  Choe, noting he came to China as bilateral relations are 
deepening, said it is also the position of the North Korean 
Nodong (Workers') Party to build the two nations' friendship for 
generations to come. 
  XINHUA said Choe conveyed greetings from North Korean 
supreme 
leader Kim Il-song and his heir-apparent, son Chong-il. 
President Jiang reciprocated with greetings to the two Kims. 
  Choe and his military delegation arrived in Beijing on 
Monday 
for a week-long visit and met Zhang Wannian, chief of general 
staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. 
  They also met with Chi Haotian, Chinese national defense 
minister, after their talks with Jiang and attended a dinner 
hosted by Chi. 
  Despite the notable absence of the nuclear problem in the 
Jiang-Choe talks, Western diplomatic sources said the Chinese 
leadership will warn North Korea of the chance of war on the 
Korean peninsula in case of U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang 
while explaining the tense moves within the United States and 
the United Nations regarding the nuclear issue. 
  China's leaders will try to drive home the seriousness of 
the 
present situation to the North Korean military, especially since 
Choe wields considerable influence, the sources said. 
  They will convey Beijing's position that in order to seek a 
solution through dialogue, North Korea must immediately stop 
unloading fuel rods from its nuclear reactor, they said.

  [Text] Beijing, June 7 (AFP)--Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin assured an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) 
delegation here Tuesday that China would take a "positive role" 
in dealing with the North Korea nuclear crisis. Jiang told the 
head of the multinational delegation, Philippine parliamentary 
speaker Jose de Venecia, that the time had come for intensified 
creative and patient diplomacy to avoid further deterioration of 
the situation and to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula. 
China will play "a positive role, not a negative role" in 
dealing with the crisis, a Philippine embassy press release 
quoted Jiang as saying. 
  His remarks came as the United Nations started informally 
debating possible sanctions against North Korea which, amid 
suspicions that it is developing a nuclear bomb, has refused to 
allow international inspectors examine crucial parts of its 
nuclear facitilies. China, one of the five permanent members of 
the UN Security Council, has so far rejected the idea of 
sanctions against Pyongyang which it says would only increase 
tensions on the Korean peninsula. 
  Jiang's comments were made in response to a proposal by de 
Valencia for active mediation in the nuclear crisis by China and 
ASEAN. 
  Meanwhile, Jiang also attempted to allay regional concerns 
over China's growing military might. China "will not be a 
threat to its neighbours," Jiang told de Valencia, adding that 
the 20-percent hike China's national defence budget this year to 
52.04 billion yuan (six billion dollars) was the result of 
inflationary adjustments.

  [Text] Beijing, 7 Jun (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin met with the Korean military delegation headed by Choe 
Kwang, chief of the Korean People's Army General Staff, at 
Zhongnanhai here this afternoon. 
  Jiang Zemin welcomed Choe Kwang on his China visit as head 
of 
the delegation. He said: "We met when the General Staff chief 
visited China in 1989. This is our second meeting in Beijing in 
five years. I am very happy to see an old friend." 
  Jiang Zemin said: China and Korea are friendly neighbors as 
closely related as lips and teeth [chun chi xiang yi di you hao 
lin bang 0782 7876 4161 0181 4104 0645 1170 6775 6721]. The two 
parties, countries, and armies enjoy traditional friendly 
relations. Further strengthening and developing this kind of 
friendly relations is of extremely great significance [shi fen 
zhong yao di yi yi 0577 0433 6850 6008 4104 1942 5030], both in 
the past and at present. Jiang Zemin emphatically pointed out: 
"The Chinese party and government attach great importance [fei 
chang zhong shi 7236 1603 6850 6018] to developing Sino-Korean 
friendship. We are satisfied with the current development of 
relations between the two parties and countries. Strengthening 
and developing Sino-Korean friendship is a firm [jian ding bu yi 
1017 1353 0008 4448] policy of our party and government, and it

  Choe Kwang thanked President Jiang Zemin for meeting the 
delegation. He said: "The delegation is visiting China in a 
situation when profound friendship between the two countries and 
the Korean and Chinese Armies are developing with each passing 
day. The warm welcome extended to the delegation by the Chinese 
people and the officers and men of the Chinese People's 
Liberation Army [PLA] reflects the profound sentiments of 
friendship of the Chinese people and Army toward Korean people 
and People's Army. He emphatically pointed out: Developing 
Korean-Chinese friendship from generation to generation has been 
the consistent stand of the Korean Workers' Party. 
  Jiang Zemin also briefed the guests on China's economic 
construction. Choe Kwang extended congratulations on the 
Chinese people's achievement made in economic construction under 
CPC leadership. 
  Choe Kwang relayed to Jiang Zemin cordial greetings from 
President Kim Il-song and Comrade Kim Chong-il. Jiang Zemin 
expressed thanks. He also asked Choe Kwang to relay his cordial 
greetings to President Kim Il-song and Comrade Kim Chong-il.

  [Text] Beijing, June 7 KYODO -- Chinese Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen on Tuesday [7 June] reiterated Beijing's opposition 
to the imposition of sanctions against North Korea to enforce 
the International Atomic Energy Agency's calls for unhampered 
access to North Korean nuclear facilities. 
  "It is not a good way to solve the problem by imposing 
sanctions," China's official XINHUA NEWS AGENCY quoted Qian as 
telling visiting Maltese Foreign Minister Guido de Marco. 
  Qian said China adheres to the stand of maintaining 
stability 
on the Korean Peninsula and making it nuclear free, hoping that 
the nuclear issue will be settled through negotiations, 
according to XINHUA. 
  Discussions about possible punitive steps against North 
Korea 
have intensified at the United Nations since the IAEA said last 
week it can no longer verify whether Pyongyang has diverted 
plutonium after its inspectors were blocked from examining fuel 
rods unloaded at a nuclear reactor. 
  The United States has said it will ask the U.N. Security 
council to impose sanctions on North Korea for its defiance of 
international nuclear safeguards. 
  China, as a permanent member of the key U.N. body, could 
wield its veto to block any measures against its traditional 
ally North Korea.

  [Text] DPRK Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam, who is now 
staying in Ukraine, said yesterday that the DPRK would not give 
in to any pressures, nor would the so-called Korean nuclear 
issue be resolved by sanctions, thus denouncing the double 
standard taken by the Western countries regarding the nuclear 
issue. 
  Kim Yong-nam said that regarding the nuclear issue, the 
Western countries, especially the United States, have conducted 
an oppressive policy toward the DPRK -- which is regarded as the 
country that does not obey them -- but instead conducted a 
policy of overlooking the behaviors of other countries that are 
regarded as their friends. 
  Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam also said that the DPRK is now 
considering Russia's proposal to hold an international 
conference attended by the United States, Russia, China, Japan, 
ROK, and DPRK to resolve the Korean nuclear issue. 
  On the same day, U.S. President Clinton, who is visiting 
European countries, expressed the hope that the DPRK would 
change its view of the nuclear issue, and that it could avoid 
economic sanctions by the international community by 
reconsidering accepting the International Atomic Energy Agency's 
inspections of the DPRK nuclear facilities.

<F P=106> ["New Talks" column article: "Is the DPRK Situation Changing </F>
Its Course of Development?"] 
  [Text] What U.S. President Bill Clinton talked about when 
he was interviewed by the CBS network television on board the 
aircraft carrier USS George Washington, which anchored in French 
waters, was the current DPRK situation and not the landings of 
Allied forces on Normandy 50 years ago. This shows that the 
world after 50 years of the event has not been genuinely 
tranquil. 
  Clinton's conversation with the reporters was still two 
sided. On the one hand, he said sanctions should be imposed on 
the DPRK and, on the other hand, he said that there was still 
time for the DPRK to change its course. Therefore, on the 
dispute over the DPRK nuclear issue, he has not yet fully 
disclosed his stand. 
  Before Clinton left Washington for Western Europe, the 
United 
States, the ROK, and Japan held a meeting of senior officials 
and adopted two resolutions. One was that the UN Security 
Council would be first invited to discuss the issue of sanctions 
against the DPRK and the other was that if the council failed to 
adopt any sanctions after discussion, the United States, the 
ROK, and Japan would impose sanctions by themselves. 
  It can thus be seen that the United States was not very sure 
of the results of the Security Council discussion. When 
speaking to reporters in the White House, although Clinton 
indicated that China and Russia, permanent members of the 
Security Council, were in support of the U.S. stand, this was 
not so as far as estimates of the international community were 
concerned. 
  Although Russian President Boris Yeltsin stated that he 
agreed with the U.S. stand on the whole, he still added: Even 
if sanctions are really imposed, they will not have any great 
effect. 
  So far Beijing has not made any official indications about 
how it will handle the issue. China has not made any remarks, 
agreeing or disagreeing, on the imposition of sanctions against 
the DPRK, let alone mentioning the issue of a veto. 
  According to reports from foreign new agencies, Beijing has 
indicated its support for Russia's proposal of convening an 
international conference. If this is true, it means that China 
is obviously unwilling to take a stand in the Security Council 
on the issue of sanctions against the DPRK, but hopes for 
another way of handling the issue. Nevertheless, the United 
States indicated that now was not the time to convene an 
international conference because the issue should be first 
handled by the United Nations. 
  In fact, even though the United States, the ROK, and Japan 
have already made common resolutions, still there are differing 
views among themselves. In the last two days, ROK Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu has carried out activities in the United 
Nations and held talks with the Chinese ambassador to the United 
Nations, Li Daoyu. Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa will 
also visit China to discuss the DPRK issue. All these show that 
there is still some gap [biao xian 5903 3807] among the three 
countries in terms of agreement. 
  Pyongyang indicated: If the United Nations does adopt any 
sanctions, this will be an act of war. This remark was in sharp 
contrast to the 50th anniversary of the landings of the Allied 
forces in Normandy, which was held yesterday. Now let us see 
what new developments will take place this week.

<F P=106> [Interview with Shi Wensheng, director of the Heilongjiang </F>
Provincial Coal Industrial Administrative Bureau and head of the 
preparatory leading group of the provincial coal department, by 
reporter Yin Liming (1438 4539 2494) on deepening reform, 
transforming mechanisms, and being extricated from a difficult 
position -- place and date not given] 
  [Text] Recently, the State Council abolished the Northeast 
China and Inner Mongolia Coal Industrial Corporation, 
established coal industrial administrative bureaus respectively 
in various provinces, simultaneously merged provincial coal 
departments with these bureaus, and defined the management 
functions and duties of the ministry and the provinces according 
to the principles of separating government functions from 
enterprise management and of balancing the relationship between 
the central authorities and the localities. On 14 May, this 
reporter had an interview with Comrade Shi Wensheng, director of 
the provincial coal industrial administrative bureau and head of 
the preparatory leading group of the provincial coal department, 
on the issues of how our province's coal enterprises can 
overcome their difficulties and extricate themselves from the 
difficult position. 
  Shi Wensheng introduced: The party Central Committee and the 
State Council fully understand and have been extremely concerned 
with the difficulties of state-owned coal enterprises cropping 
up since the development of the market economy. In March and 
April, Vice Premiers Zhu Rongji and Zou Jiahua sponsored 
meetings on several occasions to especially study the coal 
industry's problems cropping up in the operation of the economy. 
In mid April when Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and the leading 
comrades of the state departments and commissions concerned 
conducted investigation and study activities and handled 
official business on the spot in our province, they concentrated 
more energy to study and resolve the difficulties of the 
state-owned coal enterprises in Heilongjiang and also adopted a 
series of supporting measures as follows: The value added tax 
rate of the coal enterprises should be reduced from 17 percent 
to 13 percent. Four million yuan of loans will be granted to 
the Jixi, Hegang, Shuangyashan, and Qitaihe coal mining 
administrative bureaus to ensure the payment of wages to their 
staff members and workers as well as the supply of funds 
urgently needed in production. The time limit for the return of 
the loans that were granted to the Jixi and Hegang coal mining 
administrative bureaus before the Spring Festival to ensure the 
payment of the wages to their staff members and workers will be 
extended from three months to nine months. Loans will be 
granted to the power, metallurgical, and chemical industrial 
trades to help pay off the arrears of the payments for goods to 
the Jixi, Hegang, Shangyashan, and Qitaihe coal mining 
administrative bureaus. These measures have been or are being 
implemented in a step-by-step manner and will greatly help 
promote the reform, development, and stability of the 
state-owned coal enterprises in the province. It can be said 
that this is a historical turn in the development of 
Heilongjiang's coal industry. The situation ahead of the coal 
industry of the province at present can be summarized as good 
opportunities, many advantages, great difficulties, and heavy 
tasks. The key to grasping favorable opportunities, using 
advantages, overcoming and tiding over difficulties, and 
welcoming challenges hinges on the enterprises themselves. The 
coal enterprises should ultimately rely on the deepening of 
self-reform, make painstaking efforts to enhance internal 
strength, and strengthen management. 
  Shi Wensheng pointed out: Deepening reform and changing 
mechanisms is the fundamental way for coal enterprises to 
extricate themselves from the difficult position. The coal 
industry of our province should comprehensively popularize 
Kailuan's experience to carry out the simulated legal persons' 
operation method and to set up the internal market mechanism. 
It is necessary to reform the highly centralized management 
pattern of mining administrative bureaus, determine small 
accounting units, and carry out the internal economic contacts. 
The auxiliary production units of all mining administrative 
bureaus, such as machine repair plants, water works, power 
plants, and transportation departments, should assume 
responsibility for their own profits or losses, settle accounts 
for themselves, externally offer services, and push themselves 
to markets. At the time of offering internal services, the 
units in service of the people's livelihood, such as 
guesthouses, vehicle teams, and administrative services, should 
positively create income from the outside places to make up for 
the deficiency in internal services. The enterprises 
subordinate to these coal mining administrative bureaus, such as 
water and heat supply units, should create profits. Production 
plants and sections are allowed to carry out either the 
two-level legal persons management method or the simulated legal 
persons management method; keep separate accounts; settle 
different accounts among different levels; and gradually change 
from the simple relations between higher levels and lower 
levels, the relations between the first line of administrative 
management and the second line of administrative management, and 
the relations between to serve and to be served to the relations 
with the focus on economic contacts. 
  Reducing the staff and increasing efficiency is a major 
measure for the coal enterprises to halt deficits and increase 
profits. This year, the four bureaus in our province plan to 
reduce 50,000 staff members and 10,000 raw coal production 
personnel. According to this target, all bureaus should reduce 
the existing pit management personnel, reduce the quotas of the 
office cadres at various levels, remove unplanned employees, and 
strive to basically realize the goal of three-line separations 
within 2 years. Simultaneously, it is necessary to accelerate 
the setup of the modern enterprise system. The bureaus and 
collieries where conditions permit should carry out the 
corporate system on a trial basis, strive to gain experiences in 
carrying out the system, and gradually popularize it. We should 
pay attention to summing up the small-sized mines and plants' 
experiences in implementing, on a trial basis, the state 
ownership and civilian management system, the decontrolled 
management system, the leasing management system, and the 
shareholding system; gradually perfect and develop these systems 
based on the existing conditions; and expand the implementation 
of the systems. It is necessary to continue to achieve the 
auxiliary reform; to deepen the reform of the labor, wage 
distribution, and social insurance systems as well as the 
organizational structure; and to reduce enterprises' burdens on 
developing social undertakings. 
  All bureaus and mines should exert efforts to reasonably 
readjust structures and upgrade overall economic quality of 
enterprises. We should optimize the product mix, grasp the 
washing and processing of raw coal, expand the raw coal washing 
volume, and promote a big increase in coal products. According 
to the demands of markets and consumers, we should readjust the 
production volume of pits. Under the current situation that 
supply exceeds demand, we should adopt resolute measures to 
close down and suspend the operation of those pits with poor 
production conditions, without guarantee for safety in 
production, with poor coal quality, without good sales, with low 
economic results, and whose deficits surpass their wage bills 
and the extra-business expenses. 
  Although our province is rich in coal resources, the 
resources are, after all, limited and will not be produced 
forever. Some of our pits have become withered through the 
development in the past decades. Thus, we are required to grasp 
the current work, make long-term arrangements, appropriately 
readjust product mixes, and accelerate the development of the 
non-coal economy. Not only collieries but also plants should 
develop a diversified economy and the tertiary industry. We 
should extend the orientation of development from coal bases to 
coal-power, coal-steel, and coal-chemical industrial bases and 
take the paths of increasing value through processing and making 
overall development. We should prominently lay stress on the 
investment in the development of a diversified economy and the 
tertiary industry; strive to build a group of key larger-scale 
projects with strong competitiveness and good economic results; 
develop the projects with "less investment, short construction 
periods, and rapid efficiency" that are closely related to coal 
production, the construction of coal industry, and the 
livelihood of the staff and workers; ensure that a project that 
has been completed can promote the development of a number of 
other projects, and increase the input and output rates. 
  Objectively speaking, our coal enterprises are extensively 
managed and still have to tap great potential for production, 
washing and processing, sales, and supply. Thus, we must turn 
our eyes inward, tap potential, and strengthen management to 
seek high efficiency. We should set up a system of 
responsibility for control of fixed-quota production costs, 
perfect accounting and management systems, stop up loopholes, 
strengthen the management of capital, reduce all expenses, 
strengthen the management of the supply of goods and materials, 
and strive to enliven capital. 
  In short, all bureaus, collieries, and units should make 
concerted efforts, firmly grasp the main contradiction and the 
central task of being extricated from the difficult position, 
attach primary importance to implementing and expanding the 
achievements in resolving the problems in coal industrial 
development, and organize and mobilize the broad masses of party 
members, cadres, and staff and workers to make self-improvement 
and be independent and regard the rejuvenation of Heilongjiang's 
coal industry as the primary task. Only by doing will our 
province's coal enterprises be developed rapidly.

<F P=106> [By reporter Xing Shiguo (6717 0013 0948) "Heilongjiang </F>
Province Will Carry Out Mass Inspection Over the Enforcement of 
the Statistical Law"] 
  [Text] In line with the state unified demand, Heilongjiang 
Province will carry out mass inspection over the enforcement of 
the statistics law from early June this year. This is the 
specific arrangement made at the telephone conference sponsored 
by the provincial level departments concerned on 26 May. 
  It was pointed out at the conference that since the issuance 
and enforcement of the "statistics law" in 1983 and the 
"province's regulations on statistical inspection and 
supervision" in 1992, localities across the province have 
gradually oriented statistical work onto the track of legal 
systems thanks to earnestly implementing the "statistical law" 
and the "statistical regulations". However, specific 
localities and departments as well as some units and individuals 
have got blunted in their sense of statistical legal systems and 
not earnestly implemented the "statistical law". By paying no 
attention to the state statistical law, some of them have 
employed trickery on the statistical work in order to seek 
through fraud and deception the political honor and economic 
interest of their own small communities. They have also done as 
they pleases in making false statistical reports and falsifying 
the statistical data. All of these have seriously affected the 
state in making its policy decisions and conducting its 
management in this regard in a scientific way and brought about 
grave harmf to the society. For this reason, the province has 
decided to carry out mass inspection over the enforcement of the 
statistical law from early June this year. 
  The mass inspection is aimed at all investigation units 
across the province, which are organizing the statistical 
investigation, and at all units (state apparatus, social 
communities, and enterprises and establishments in various 
economic sectors) that ought to accept the investigation and are 
obligated to provide their statistical data. It also chiefly 
aimed at the following unlawful practices cropping up in the 
statistical activities over the past few years and particularly 
since 1993: 
  1. The statistical reports have been falsified and the 
statistical data have been forged or distorted. 
  2. The statistical organs and personnel have been forced or 
incited to employ trickery in their statistical data. 
  3. The statistical personnel who have upheld the principles 
of making statistical reports according to the facts and 
informing against or exposing the unlawful practices in this 
regard have been retaliated against. 
  4. Units have refused to make their statistical report or 
repeatedly delayed their reports. 
  5. Units have caused losses and harmful influence by 
publishing or providing their statistical data arbitrarily and 
by letting out the state secret. 
  6. Units have conducted at will the dismantlement and merger 
of statistical organs or weakened the strength of statistical 
affairs. 
  7. Units have obstructed the investigation and handling 
conducted by the supervisory and statistical departments for the 
violation cases. 
  The focal point of the mass inspection will be placed on the 
unlawful practices of employing statistical trickery in the 
fields of industrial output value, particularly the output value 
of township enterprises, population, grain output and storage, 
per peasant net income, investments made in fixed assets, and 
price index. All of these have drawn a greater complaint from 
various social circles. 
  In order to successfully carry out the mass inspection Zhang 
Chengyi, assistant to the governor, urged various administrative 
offices and the party committee of various cities and counties 
to establish a specialized leading group or working body to 
investigate and handle the violation cases in this regard by 
taking a clear-cut stand. They should resolutely investigate 
through to the end and in line with the law the units and 
individuals who have employed trickery in the important 
statistical data in order to seek through fraud and deception 
their own political honor and economic interest and their own 
small communities interests, as well as units and individuals 
who have retaliated with the activities of fraud and deception. 
By no means should they wink at or tolerate these units and 
individuals. He also urged various localities to integrate the 
mass inspection with the education on popularizing the law, with 
the basic construction of statistical work, and with the 
investigation and handling of violation cases. 
  The mass inspection will conclude at the end of August this 
year.

<F P=106> [Article by Acting Governor Wen Shizhen: "Develop High and </F>
New Technological Industries, Use High and New Technologies To 
Transform Traditional Industries, and Carry Out Intensive 
Processing Industry To Revitalize the Old Industrial Base"] 
  [Text] Accelerating the development of high and new 
technological industries, using high and new technologies to 
transform traditional industries, and carrying out intensive 
processing of natural resources and raw materials constitute a 
strategic issue affecting Liaoning's overall situation. It is 
not only a task of the 1990's, but also a transcentury project. 
  1. Developing high and new technologies, using high and new 
technologies to transform traditional industries, and carrying 
out raw materials intensive processing industry is a very 
essential and urgent task. 
  Liaoning has chiefly developed basic and raw materials 
industries and its traditional industries have accounted for 
more than 90 percent of the GNP. This industrial structure has 
advantages under the planned economic system and contributed 
greatly to the state. However, after the unfoldment of reform 
and opening up, all localities across the country have competed 
with one another to readjust their industrial structure. In 
order to make up for the shortage of raw materials, some 
provinces in south China have developed a number of basic 
industries. During the late 1980's, the situation that south 
China had to rely on north China in basic industries began to 
change and Liaoning's raw materials industry has new 
competitors. On the other hand, south China has also developed a 
number of high and new technology industries. Some high and new 
technology industries in Shanghai and Guangdong have reached a 
fair scale. However, Liaoning's high and new technology 
industries are still in an initiative stage. This has made our 
province suffered attacks front and rear during competitions in 
the domestic markets. 
  Judging from the foreign situation, since the 1980's, some 
developed countries, while developing high and new technology 
industries, have also competed with one another to use high and 
new technologies to transform traditional industries and 
enhanced the competitive ability on the international markets, 
thus imposing a severe challenge on some developing countries 
and regions. They have also exerted their utmost to develop 
high and new technology industries of their own and used high 
and new technologies to transform traditional industries. I 
have conducted inspection tours to the ROK twice and found that 
it has no natural resources. Before the mid 1960's, nearly all 
the industries of Liaoning were better than those of the ROK. 
However, through development, the value of imports and exports 
of the ROK is now commensurate with our country. The 
technological levels of some industries, such as ship building, 
machinery, petrochemical, electronics, textile, iron and steel 
industries, are far in advance of our country by 10 to 15 years. 
The key experience of the ROK is that it has paid attention to 
science and technology, developed industries with a high 
starting point and high level, followed the path of extensively 
pooling the strong points of all, and absorbed the advanced 
science and technology of all countries. 
  In face of the acute competitions on the domestic and 
foreign 
markets, if we fail to accelerate the pace of using high and new 
technologies to transform traditional industries, we will lag 
far behind at home and abroad. A strong sense of crisis and 
responsibility has urged us to race against time to grasp this 
issue. Only by using domestic and foreign advanced high and new 
technologies to transform the traditional industries can we make 
the level of our technologies and equipments leap over some 
development stages and reach the international or domestic 
advanced level, upgrade and update the product quality, variety, 
and grades by leaps and bounds, and enhance their 
competitiveness in the domestic and foreign markets. Only thus, 
can we leap over backwardness caused by our lagging behind the 
time, catch up with the developing trends at home and abroad, 
and rejuvenate the old base. 
  2. Developing high-and-new tech industries, using high and 
new technologies to transform traditional industries, and 
conducting the intensive processing of natural resources and raw 
materials, represent a fundamental task for making the old 
industrial base prosperous. 
  It is very important for us to straighten out our thinking 
in 
the issue of how to change the old outlook of the old base into 
a new one. The thinking defined for readjusting the industrial 
structure of the old base in Liaoning by persistently regarding 
markets as a guiding orientation and on the basis of summarizing 
the practice, experience, and lesson; analyzing the development 
trend of markets at home and abroad; and of studying or 
understanding again the province's situation; is to develop 
high-and-new tech industries, to use high and new technologies 
to transform traditional industries, and to conduct the 
intensive processing of natural resources and raw materials. 
  Developing high-and-new tech industries should be accurately 
aimed at markets at home and abroad. Efforts should be made to 
develop a large number of high-and-new tech industries that have 
large strength in bringing along the national economy, can exert 
strong influence, and possess the characteristics of Liaoning. 
These high-and-new technologies include robots, computers, bar 
codes, thin coating and coating products, super fine fiber and 
fabrics, super fine phenolic material, electric and electronic 
technologies and products, active talcum powder and by-products, 
neodyimium-iron-boron permanent-magnet material, radiation 
engineering, biological engineering, and astronautics. 
  In transforming the traditional industries, we should 
closely 
follow the principles of developing natural resources and 
conducting the intensive processing of raw materials and 
accelerate the technical renovations. Major efforts should be 
made to successfully encourage the industries of raw materials 
to conduct intensive processing; to upgrade the rate of final 
products; and to extend the technical linking among the 
industries of metallurgy, petroleum, chemicals, and building 
materials. It is necessary to conduct the second and third 
processing in the raw material production. At the same time, we 
should renovate the technologies and equipment to upgrade the 
quality of products, to lower the cost, to upgrade the labor 
productivity, and to score best economic results. 
  Equipment industries should enforce the unified project 
between machinery and electronic production and apply the micro 
electronic technologies to transforming the machinery industry. 
Meanwhile, efforts should be made to upgrade the coordinated 
service between machinery and electronic industries and to 
develop an integrated project system between them in the fields 
of research, design, manufacture, installation, readjustment, 
and experiment. As being the equipment sector in the national 
economy, the machinery and electronic industries should 
successfully render a unified service. 
  Industries in charge of general processing should chiefly 
increase the variety of new products suitable to the demands of 
markets at home and abroad and uphold high starting point, high 
level, large scale, and high effect in the development of new 
products. 
  It is also necessary to conduct the intensive processing of 
agricultural resources. We should also develop the resources of 
planting, raising, and maritime undertakings to the operation of 
intensive processing and bring about a change to the situation 
in which a truck of potable water (mineral water in the south) 
has been exchanged with seven trucks of grains. Developing 
high-and-new tech industries, using high and new technologies to 
transform traditional industries, and conducting the intensive 
processing of natural resources and raw materials actually 
represent the endeavor to bring the strong points into play and 
to exploit these strong points to avoid shortcomings under the 
conditions of socialist market economy. Exploiting the strong 
points means to bring into play the superiority possessed by the 
basic industries. In the view of far-reaching development, 
these strong points may be eliminated. However, they are still 
the superiority of the province in the near future, therefore, 
we should bring the superiority into play and use the high and 
new technologies to reform it. For example, the iron and steel 
industry is still the basic industry of Liaoning and we should 
still bring it into play. The province's shortcomings include 
electronic industry and biological engineering as well as the 
technologies of distribution and automation. We should no 
longer avoid these shortcomings, but try to make them up. Only 
by making up these shortcomings in the coming few years can we 
achieve a better products' mix and economic results. 
  3. Countermeasures and Measures 
  We should combine long-term and short-term countermeasures 
and measures, make them realistic and feasible, work out overall 
plans for them, and carry them out step by step. 
  A. The issue on sources of technology. We should persist in 
learning from others' strong points extensively, both at home 
and abroad. We should take advantage of the conditions provided 
by opening to the outside world and adopt various measures to 
bring in advanced technology from abroad through various 
channels, such as direct foreign investment, licensed trade, 
compensation trade, cooperation in designing and development, 
establishment of scientific research institutes abroad, and 
purchases of foreign scientific research institutes. Meanwhile, 
Liaoning should fully develop its scientific and technological 
advantages to establish its own scientific research network 
consisting of scientific research, technological development, 
and intermediate experiment engineering centers. It should 
accelerate the transformation of the achievements of scientific 
research institutes into productive forces. 
  In developing high and new technology, Liaoning should 
develop the main body and the two wings. Enterprises constitute 
the main body in the endeavor of high- and new-tech industry 
development, transformation of traditional industries with high 
and new technology, and intensive processing of resources and 
raw materials. This is because enterprises, especially large and 
medium-sized ones, have fairly complete development, research, 
and designing systems. Enterprises are also the main body to use 
productive forces and ultimately to produce new ones. We should 
also develop the role of the "two wings," one being scientific 
research institutes and colleges and universities and the other 
being foreign advanced technology. The main body is the 
foundation, and the two wings are the important sources 
providing high and new technology to the main body. Integrating 
these three parts together, Liaoning will be like a tiger that 
has grown wings. 
  B. The issue on mechanisms. We should apply the market 
mechanism to cultivating new growing points of the economy and 
never return to the old systems. In developing high- and 
new-tech industries, transforming traditional industries with 
high and new technology, and expanding intensive processing of 
resources and raw materials, the system whereby major investors 
hold the responsibility for risks should be applied to the 
adjustment of the industrial structure, and a mechanism of 
competition should take shape. This should be combined with the 
efforts to deepen reform and establish a modern enterprise 
system. We should establish a modern enterprise system, 
transform enterprises into companies, implement the shareholding 
system, transplant enterprises with foreign capital, develop 
contracts for scientific and technological tasks, and 
commercialize technological achievements so that enterprises 
will become a genuine main body of interests, investment, and 
market. 
  C. Open up wide sources of funds. As great amounts of funds 
are needed in transforming the old base, it is impossible to 
rely entirely on the state. We should pool the idle funds in 
society through reform, opening up, and the reform of the 
banking system. We should borrow funds from both the domestic 
and the world markets, carry out the shareholding system, allow 
scientific research units to buy shares with their technology, 
allow enterprise legal persons to invest, and list enterprises 
on the market. When raising funds from abroad, we may 
transplant enterprises with foreign capital; sell property right 
to foreign countries in exchange for ownership of some stocks 
and sell the stock ownership to raise funds for investment; or 
use commercial loans. In short, we should broaden our fields of 
thinking and the sources of funds through reform and opening up. 
Adopting new ideas, new concepts, and new methods to address 
problems, we will find our road becoming broader and broader. 
  D. The issue on professionals. In developing high-and-new 
tech industries, using high and new technologies to transform 
traditional industries, and conducting the intensive processing 
of natural resources and raw materials, we must first of all 
train and bring up scientific and technological professionals, 
who should be regarded as the foundation. A fine environment 
and good conditions should be created to train outstanding 
professionals for Liaoning. This is a major matter that must be 
solved by the provincial government. Therefore, we should truly 
distribute income for professionals according to their work in 
order to manifest the value of science and technology. Wages of 
scientists and technicians should be linked with their 
performances. We should let scientists and technicians, 
high-tech professionals in particular, become rich first. 
Second, we should relax restrictions imposed on professionals 
and allow scientists and technicians to flow from one place to 
another. Third, we should not determine the positions and 
social status of scientists and technicians according to their 
seniority. A good condition should be created for young 
scientists and technicians. Only with the rapid growth of young 
scientists and technicians, can Liaoning invigorate its 
scientific, technological, and economic development. Fourth, we 
should draw professionals from abroad and make foreign 
professionals serve China. 
  E. We should do a solid job and pay attention to 
implementation. Developing high-and-new tech industries, using 
high and new technologies to transform traditional industries, 
and conducting the intensive processing of natural resources and 
raw materials represent a huge systems engineering as well as 
the key content of the "second pioneering program." Therefore, 
they must be incorporated to the development strategy of the 
province and various cities. This project should be considered 
the key point of Liaoning's plan for 2010. The items without 
using high and new technologies and the items that do not 
conduct intensive processing should never be initiated. At 
present, our problem lies in the failure in offering even more 
and better high-and-new tech items for the reason of lacking a 
wide field of vision on science and technology. Without the 
mastery of current economic and technological information and 
development trends by economic policymakers and senior managers, 
we cannot define the orientation of scientific and technological 
development. Only when scientists and technicians master high 
and new technologies, can we use high and new scientific and 
technological achievements to transform old technologies, old 
equipment, and old products. The problems in this aspect must 
be resolved. The policy of reducing the staff of the organs 
directly under the provincial authorities by 300 persons should 
be remained unchanged for the time being. After the transfer of 
the personnel eliminated by the organizational reform, we should 
employ a number of young and middle-aged senior scientists and 
technicians and managers from society to intensify the strength 
of some important departments. In developing high-and-new tech 
industries and using new and high technologies to transform 
traditional industries, we must conscientiously organize 
implementation, and specific arrangements should be made for 
each trade and each year. 
  In developing high-and-new tech industries, using high and 
new technologies to transform traditional industries, conducting 
the intensive processing of natural resources and raw materials, 
and conducting structural readjustment, it is hard for Liaoning 
to achieve remarkable results within 10 years. We should have 
our eyes on the present, have our feet firmly planted at the 
next century, do a solid job step by step from now on, and work 
hard for 10 years. If we do so, it is completely possible for us 
to replace the old outlook of Liaoning with a new outlook and to 
fulfill the magnificent goal of the "second pioneering program."

  [Text] Regarding it as a major matter in stabilizing the 
overall situation and in promoting social and economic 
development, women's federations at all levels in the province 
have paid attention to the reemployment of laid-off female 
workers in urban areas over the past two years. These 
federations have also extensively launched the activity of 
"encouraging women to pioneer new undertakings," and achieved 
remarkable results. According to initial figures, some 100,000 
laid-off female workers in the province have thus far returned 
to their production posts with the help of women's federations, 
and these women once more have hope. Huang Qizao, vice president 
of the All-China Women's Federation, highly appraised the work 
of women's federations at all levels in the province. 
  Liaoning is a major industrial province, employing 4.2 
million female workers. While reform in employment, personnel, 
and income distribution systems continuously deepened, the 
competition resulted in 420,000 female workers losing their jobs 
for a variety of practical and historical reasons. Experiencing 
difficulties in making ends meet, some of these women lost their 
mental balance and become a hot social problem. Faced with this 
new contradiction, women's federations at all levels in the 
province marked the appropriate rehiring of laid-off female 
workers as the focal point of the activity to "encourage women 
to make contributions" in an effort to share the burdens of the 
state and resolve problems for the people. 
  Professional training was strengthened among the laid-off 
female workers to enable them to master skills and regain jobs. 
Based on the reality that most laid-off female workers lack 
competitiveness, skills, and ability, women's federations at all 
levels have arranged for such women to study, change their 
concepts on choosing jobs, and enhance their sense of 
competition while utilizing women's organizations and fronts to 
launch diverse forms of training classes for such women, thus 
laying a foundation for their reemployment. According to initial 
figures, women's federations at all levels in the province as 
well as various female workers organizations have sponsored some 
200 training classes on specialized skills, and some 900,000 
women have attended these classes. 
  Sources in various fields have been pooled together to 
provide more employment opportunities for the laid-off female 
workers. Women's federations at all levels in the province have 
fully exploited their advantages to coordinate trade unions, 
industrial and commercial departments, scientific and 
technological units, and individuals associations to help the 
laid-off female workers meet their pressing needs. Female 
workers organizations under trade unions of various levels have 
launched the activity of "serving as economic matchmakers" and 
helped enterprises work out plans for developing the tertiary 
industrial businesses that suit women. The women's federation 
in Fushun's Xinfu District has set foot in relevant units and 
enterprises on numerous occasions to seek jobs for 300 laid-off 
female workers. 
  Economic entities and serve-the-people networks have been 
set up to help locate jobs for laid-off female workers. Women's 
federations at all levels in the province have vigorously 
initiated economic entities to place a large number of laid-off 
female workers. So far, the 2,900 economic entities initiated 
by women's federations at various levels have placed 30,000 
laid-off female workers. The 46 enterprises subordinate to the 
Mulan Corporation initiated by the Shenyang City Women's 
Federation have provided jobs for nearly 2,000 laid-off women. 
The Shenyang City Women's Federation has stipulated that all 
economic entities and enterprises run by women's federations 
should locate jobs for a fixed number of laid-off female 
workers, and a new department has been set up to handle these 
affairs. In addition, women's federations in various districts 
and neighborhoods have run 16,000 serve-the-people networks, 
such as food and groceries centers, child-care centers, and 
snack corners, and some 50,000 laid-off female workers have been 
employed. 
  Employment agencies have been set up to provide timely help 
for laid-off female workers. Women's federations at all levels 
in the province have set up a dozen women's employment agencies. 
By introducing such work opportunities as housekeeping, home 
teachers, and hourly employment as household servants, these 
employment agencies have found new jobs for over 1,000 laid-off 
female workers. 
  After regaining employment, female workers who were once 
unemployed have become more skillful and more competitive, thus 
becoming effective forces in developing the economy. More than 
20,000 laid-off female workers in Fushun city have found their 
new positions in the handicraft and knitting trades. Zhang 
Shiqin, a laid-off female worker of the Fushun Chemical 
Industrial Plant, initiated the Liaodong Synthetic Waterproof 
Materials Plant together with a veteran plant director. Within 
five years, this plant had paid 1 million yuan in tax to the 
state, and its products filled the gaps in Fushun's building 
materials trade. Additionally, this plant provided jobs for 200 
laid-off female workers. On the "8 March Women's Day" this 
year, Zhang Shiqin was appraised as the "outstanding woman of 
the province in the reform period." 
  On 11 May, the provincial women's federation held an 
on-the-spot meeting to exchange experiences in launching the 
activity of pioneering new undertakings and promoting stability 
and to further develop the work concerning the reemployment of 
laid-off female workers. Huang Qizao, vice president of the 
All-China Women's Federation and first secretary of the 
Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation, and Hua Fuzhou, 
secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's 
Federation, attended and gave speeches at the meeting to guide 
responsible persons of women's federations in Tianjin, Shanxi, 
Changchun, Harbin, and Chongqing. Wang Huaiyuan, Zhang 
Guoguang, Xu Wencai, and Chen Suzhi, leaders of Liaoning 
Province and Shenyang city, also attended and spoke at this 
meeting.

<F P=106> ["Vigorously Carry Out Plans for Key Help-the-Poor Projects </F>
and Promote Economic Development in Mountain Regions"] 
  [Text] From 25 to 27 May, the Anhui provincial party 
committee and provincial government held a meeting on the work 
of helping poor and mountainous regions in economic development. 
The meeting summed up and exchanged experience in helping poor 
and mountainous regions in economic development and discussed 
the policies, measures, and ways for poor and mountainous 
regions to develop the economy and free themselves from poverty. 
Responsible comrades of 37 poor counties and mountain counties 
(cities), as well as the prefectures, cities, and provincial 
departments concerned, attended the meeting. 
  Lu Rongjing, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
and 
Governor Fu Xishou delivered important speeches at the meeting. 
Wang Zhaoyao, member of the Standing Committee of the provincial 
party committee and vice governor of Anhui, conveyed to the 
provincial meeting the guidelines of the national meeting on the 
work of helping poor regions to develop. Fang Zhaoxiang, deputy 
secretary of the provincial party committee, presided over the 
meeting and gave a summing-up speech. 
  Other provincial leaders present at the meeting were Yang 
Yongliang, Wang Taihua, Chen Jiyu, and Wang Sheyun. Also 
present was Cui Jianxiao, adviser to the provincial leading 
group the help-the-poor work. 
  In his speech, Lu Rongjing discussed the following five 
points on how to further understand the great significance of 
helping poor and mountainous regions in economic development and 
how to help them shake off poverty and achieve prosperity as 
soon as possible: 
<H5>  1. Helping poor and mountainous regions achieve prosperity </H5>
sooner is an important economic task, as well as an important 
political task, and we must always pay great attention to it. 
  Lu Rongjing said: To wipe out poverty and achieve a common 
prosperity is the essence of socialism, as well as its 
superiority. More than one-third of Anhui's counties are rated 
as poor counties or marginally poor counties and entitled to 
state and provincial aid, and about one-third of the land in the 
province is mountainous. It is evident that if the poor and 
mountainous regions cannot shake off poverty and achieve 
prosperity soon, they will impede Anhui's economic development 
and seriously prevent the province from attaining its goal of 
becoming fairly well-off on schedule. Most of Anhui's 
mountainous regions are old revolutionary base areas, 
particularly the Dabieshan region and the southern Anhui 
mountainous regions. During both the revolutionary war period 
and the socialist construction period, the people in the 
mountainous regions have displayed selfless dedication and made 
great contributions. Over many years, some poor regions along 
the Chang Jiang and the Huai He have repeatedly made great 
sacrifices to bear flood losses in the interests of the whole. 
We have the obligation to help those regions develop faster and 
make the people there improve their living standards sooner. 
For this reason, helping poor and mountainous regions achieve 
prosperity sooner is not only an important economic task, but 
also an important political task. 
<H5>  2. To Accelerate Development, Poor and Mountainous Regions </H5>
Must Firmly Establish the Notion of Self-Reliance and Hard 
Struggle, and Earnestly Rely on Their Own Efforts To Improve 
Their Situation. 
  Lu Rongjing said: Of course, the government will, as always, 
help poor and mountainous regions shake off poverty and achieve 
prosperity sooner. However, those regions must regard the help 
of the government and others merely as a motive force, and they 
must mainly rely on their own efforts to improve their backward 
situation. In development, poor and mountainous regions indeed 
have great difficulties, but they also have great potential. In 
particular, they have the advantage of possessing certain 
natural resources. With a strong desire to shake off poverty 
and achieve prosperity, the people in those regions have an 
extremely great initiative and creativity for developing the 
economy and improving their backward situation. If the masses 
are widely mobilized, their enthusiasm for braving the elements 
is aroused, and their potential and strength are brought into 
play, they will be able to blaze a new trail and truly shake off 
poverty and achieve prosperity. 
<H5>  3. It Is Necessary To Consider Local Realities, Give Play to </H5>
Local Strong Points and Salient Features, and Constantly Explore 
and Improve the Ways of Economic Development for Poor and 
Mountainous Regions During the Course of Practice. 
  Lu Rongjing said: The practice of reform and development has 
told us that the concept of economic development has an 
important bearing on the speed and efficiency of economic 
development as well as on the changes in the economic situation. 
The most fundamental way to straighten out an economic 
development concept is to adhere to the ideological line of 
"emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts," judge 
everything by whether it is conducive to the development of 
productive forces, and respect the initiative of the masses. We 
should consider local realities, find out the right place to 
make a breakthrough, and give play to our superiority and 
salient features. Any development concept which conforms to 
local realities should be upheld persistently and implemented 
step by step. 
<H5>  4. It Is Necessary To Fully Understand the Opportunities </H5>
Created in the Transition From a Planned Economy to a Market 
Economy and Make Best Use of it To Vigorously Resolve the 
Prominent Issues Existing in Poor and Mountainous Regions. 
  Lu Rongjing said: Anhui's poor and mountainous regions are 
endowed with rich natural and human resources. The gradual 
establishment of a market economy has created unprecedented 
opportunities and broad prospects for the development of these 
regions' resources. We must increase our awareness of current 
opportunities and do everything possible to seize them and take 
advantage of them. Currently, we must pay special attention to 
resolving several prominent issues. First, we must use the 
market as our guide to step up structural adjustment. Second, 
we must strengthen socialized service and market construction, 
and we must unclog distribution. Third, we must increase 
investment and strengthen the building of infrastructure. 
Fourth, we must improve science and technology education and 
raise our population's standards. 
<H5>  5. It Is Necessary To Strengthen Leadership Over Work in </H5>
Poor and Mountainous Regions, Make Concerted Efforts, Pool All 
our Wisdom and Efforts, and Jointly Fulfill our Important 
Historic Mission of Helping the Poor Cast Off Poverty and Become 
Prosperous. 
  Lu Rongjing said: Party committees and governments at all 
levels in poor and mountainous regions must always help peasants 
cast off poverty and become prosperous, and they must regard 
this as their foremost task. As always, they should be 
duty-bound to strengthen leadership over the work of helping the 
poor to develop. We must be resolved to earnestly change our 
leadership and work style, go deep into the grassroots and among 
the masses, conduct investigation and study in a down-to-earth 
manner, and earnestly implement policies on helping the poor to 
develop. We must try to discover models, review our 
experiences, give different guidance to suit different 
conditions, and earnestly carry out work in this respect. 
  Grass-roots organizations and cadres play a role that will 
determine whether or not poor and mountainous regions can 
accelerate the pace to cast off poverty and become prosperous. 
We must strengthen the functions of towns and townships through 
constant in-depth reform to make it possible for town and 
township party committees and governments to effectively 
exercise their power, more successfully implement the party's 
relevant principles and policies, and organize and lead the 
masses in carrying out development. Village organizations, which 
are on the frontline of helping the poor to develop, are vital 
to the success of this work. Therefore, we must earnestly 
strengthen the building of party branches at the village level, 
particularly by doing a good job of selecting branch 
secretaries. We must pay attention to maintaining stability of 
cadres in poor and mountainous regions; there should not be 
excessive personnel changes. 
  In his speech, Fu Xishou first analyzed the situation in 
helping our province's poor and mountainous regions to develop 
and the tasks facing us. He said: Since the beginning of the 
Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the 
vast number of cadres and masses in our mountainous and poor 
regions have upheld reform and opening up, relying on themselves 
to build up their regions through thrift and diligence. As a 
result, the local economy has developed considerably and their 
overall strength has increased notably. In 1993, the 37 
counties (cities and districts) accounted for 27 billion yuan of 
the GNP, their gross industrial and agricultural output value 
reached 47.4 billion yuan, and their revenues totaled 1.4 
billion yuan, an increase of 2.5 times, 3.2 times, and 2.2 
times, respectively, over 1978. Construction of infrastructure 
has steadily increased with more than 5,000 kilometers of 
highway opened to traffic, and program-controlled telephones set 
up in all of the county towns. Our peasants' per capita income 
last year was 636 yuan, an increase of 7.4 times that of 1978. 
The number of people below the poverty line in 21 poor counties 
has decreased by 3 million from 1985. However, the task of 
helping the poor to develop in our province is still difficult. 
As a whole, the economy in the mountainous region is still 
fairly backward. We must not overestimate our achievements. 
  Fu Xishou pointed out: To accelerate the pace of helping the 
poor and speed up economic development in poor and mountainous 
regions, we must successfully carry out the following six tasks 
in a down-to-earth manner: 1) We must earnestly do well in 
agriculture to lay a strong foundation for the development of 
poor and mountainous regions. Anhui's mountainous and poor 
regions are endowed with rich agricultural resources and have a 
variety of farm produce. However, its rich resources have not 
been fully exploited. We must use the market as guide to 
comprehensively develop their agricultural resources and 
vigorously develop a type of farming that provides high yields 
of fine quality with maximum efficiency. With enterprises as 
the leader, we should link thousands upon thousands of families 
in the regions with domestic and foreign markets and take the 
road of forming economic associations that combine agriculture 
with manufacturing and trade. 2) We must not let up on the 
development of village and town enterprises but vigorously 
promote them. We must begin the task by developing whatever 
projects are possible, based firmly on actual conditions. We 
should respect peasants' choice of types of ownership and allow 
them to operate as collectives, individual households, private 
enterprises, or shareholdings. We should treat everybody 
equally without discrimination. 3) We must run county-owned 
industries, particularly state enterprises, effectively. We 
should strive to follow market changes with interest, strengthen 
technological transformation, readjust the product mix, and 
improve enterprise management. 4) We must invigorate commodity 
circulation as well as concentrate our efforts on establishing 
transportation carriers and improving the circulation 
environment. We must do a good job in developing the commodity 
market and introducing peasants to the market. 5) We must 
insist on promoting development with reform and opening up. 
While taking measures to manage collectives' land ownership 
well, we must strengthen land-use rights. All localities must 
realistically study and formulate specific methods for 
quickening forestry and water resource development, so as to 
centralize as well as bring about collective operations and 
increased efficiency in land-use. 6) We must meticulously 
manage our financial and taxation matters to bring them into a 
better position as soon as possible. Fu Xishou said: 
Governments and departments at all levels must continue to 
increase their input in poor and mountainous regions. This 
year, the state has decided to increase the amount of existing 
funds, with Anhui's development fund for the poor topping 600 
million yuan. We must effectively develop education and assist 
the poor through science and technology. We must implement the 
9-year compulsory education system, develop vocational and 
technical education, and train personnel in practical and 
specialized skills. We must mobilize all social forces to 
jointly undertake the tasks to become well-off. Last year, the 
provincial government decided to adopt a system whereby 
provincial departments, cities under the jurisdiction of the 
provincial government, as well as large- and medium-sized 
enterprises were asked to help their counterparts in 21 poor 
counties. The policy will be implemented unchanged for several 
years until the poor regions cast off poverty. We must 
encourage well-off regions to help poor regions. And, 
economically developed regions should take the initiative to 
help poor and mountainous counties. They should utilize their 
edges in technology, personnel, market, information, and 
material resources to develop the resources of poor and 
mountainous regions through various channels such as economic 
cooperation, technical services, employment of labor services, 
and product distribution. They should cooperate with these poor 
regions in joint development on the basis of mutual benefit and 
supplementing one another with individual edges. The provincial 
party committee has decided that, beginning this year, 
provincial organizations will transfer department-level cadres 
to work with their counterparts in poor regions. Prefectural 
(city) and county offices will also transfer cadres to work with 
townships (towns) and administrative villages to help these 
regions cast off poverty more quickly. 
  Regarding several specific policies on supporting economic 
development in mountainous regions, Fu Xishou said: Based on 
investigation and study, the provincial party committee and 
government have readjusted some policies on mountainous regions 
and formulated some new policies and measures, which all 
localities and relevant provincial departments must earnestly 
implement.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Sustained Inflation Momentum Basically </F>
Curbed, Tightened Money Supply To Insure Strength of Regulation 
and Control"] 
  [Text] An authoritative person in Chinese economic circles 
has pointed out that, at present, inflation in China is 
basically stable and is expected to fall in the second half of 
the year. However, viewed from the macroeconomic situation at 
present, we still cannot increase the overall money supply but 
should maintain the present strength of macroeconomic regulation 
and control. 
  During a special interview with a MING PAO reporter, the 
authoritative person pointed out: Recently, inflation in China 
has the growth of the average national retail commodity price 
index, which reflects inflation, remains at about 20 percent and 
the momentum of sustained growth has been curbed. Inflation is 
expected to gradually fall in the second half of this year. 
  However, he pointed out that although the momentum of growth 
in inflation has been curbed, the trend is not yet completely 
clear. To promote falling inflation, three conditions are 
required: first, a continued increase in agricultural output 
this year or at least for output not to decrease; second, a 
stable political situation; third, macroeconomic policies remain 
stable. 
  The personality said that, on the whole, the goal of 
macroregulation and control this year should still be set at the 
original credit scale of 470 billion yuan and the total volume 
of credit should be controlled within 500 billion. Therefore, 
the existing strength of regulation and control should not be 
reduced in an overall manner and only partial readjustments with 
clear targets should be made. 
  It has been disclosed that because of relatively tight money 
supply, state enterprises are having universal difficulties in 
their operations. To ease the difficulties of state enterprises 
in terms of the shortage of funds, China granted 60 billion yuan 
of bank loans to state enterprises from March to April this 
year. Recently, some localities have again asked for loans to a 
large number of state enterprises which are on the brink of 
closing down. 
  The authoritative personality pointed out: The loans granted 
to enterprises in March and April were only a partial structural 
readjustment and did not mean an increase in the money supply on 
the whole. If loans for state enterprises are increased in an 
overall manner irrespective of economic results, this will mean 
a major readjustment of financial policy. Judging from present 
conditions, a policy readjustment of this kind is not likely. 
  Another noted economist pointed out: The macroeconomic 
situation in China at present still depends on investment in 
fixed assets. Last year, China invested as much as 1,000 billion 
yuan in fixed assets, nearly 400 billion yuan more than the 
previous year. This caused the rapid growth of inflation in 
China. 
  He pointed out: Investment in fixed assets should have a 
certain balance, that is, on the one hand, it should not cause 
excessive inflation, and, on the other, it should be able to 
maintain economic growth.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 1 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Li Yonggui, 
deputy director of the State General Administration of Taxation, 
has indicated that real estate transferred in the period before 
the implementation of the land value-added tax regulations will 
be exempted from tax, adding that exemptions will be provided 
under two conditions after the enforcement of the land 
value-added tax regulations. First, standard apartments built 
by tax payers will be exempted from value-added tax as long as 
their value added does not exceed 20 percent of the amount of 
items for deduction. Second, real estate requisitioned or 
recovered for state construction projects will be exempted from 
value-added tax. 
  While attending a recent seminar in Hong Kong, Li Yonggui 
said that the basis for calculating value-added tax is the 
amount deducted from real estate sales income. Items for 
deduction include the following: 
  --The amount paid for the acquisition of land utility 
rights. 
  --The cost and expense of land reclamation. 
  --The cost and expense for the construction of new houses 
and 
facilities, or the appraisal prices of old houses and buildings. 
  --The tax amount related to real estate transfers. 
  --Other items for deduction listed by the Ministry of 
Finance. 
  He pointed out that these are the principles of the 
regulations and that the details will be clarified in the 
implementation rules. 
  In Li Yonggui's opinion, it is reasonable to say that 
inflation and risk-bearing factors should be included in the 
items for deduction and that this will be taken into account 
when working out the implementation rules, according to the 
regulations on "items for deduction listed by the Ministry of 
Finance."

<F P=106> [By commentators Li Hongbo (2621 3163 3134) and Yan Kalin </F>
(7051 0595 2651): "Correctly Evaluate Current Economic 
Situation, Push Ahead With Reform, and Open Up With Full 
Confidence"] 
  [Text] Since the beginning of this year, China's reform, 
opening up, and economic development have proceeded at a fairly 
fast pace and the achievements have been outstanding. How is 
the general situation at present? How should we observe some 
problems existing in economic life? It is necessary to make a 
serious assessment and analysis. 
  The word "situation" is a dynamic concept. In observing and 
evaluating a situation it is first necessary to look at the 
overall situation, the principal aspects, and the development. 
  This year is a crucial one for China to push ahead reform, 
opening up, and economic construction. Since the beginning of 
this year, not only has a series of major reform measures, such 
as finance, taxation, banking, and foreign exchange, been 
adopted in turn according to plan but the progress has been 
smooth as a whole. News from relevant departments shows that, 
under the new tax system, the financial revenue and expenditure 
between January and April kept on growing normally and the 
budget execution was in keeping with the requirements. In 
banking reform, the state development bank has been officially 
set up and intensified preparations are under way to set up 
other policy-related banks. In reforming the foreign exchange 
management structure, the unification of the exchange rate was 
completed in the first quarter of this year and the bank's 
foreign exchange settlement and sales system was implemented on 
1 April; there have been brisk transactions between domestic and 
foreign-funded banks, with settlements outstripping sales of 
foreign exchange. The reforms and experiments on establishing a 
modern enterprise system are also under way. The steady advance 
of these in-depth reform measures indicates that China has taken 
solid steps in establishing a socialist market economy. 
  Meanwhile, the overall situation in the national economic 
operations shows signs of improvement. In the first quarter, 
the economic growth rate maintained fairly rapid growth in the 
midst of a steady drop, agricultural production gradually heated 
up, industrial production grew steadily, and the domestic market 
was basically stable. For over 90 percent of commodities in 
different varieties, there was still a balance between supply 
and demand or an excess of supply over demand. 
  At this time last year, just as the Chinese economy was 
overheated, not only was there a seething fever in real estate, 
stocks, and development zones, which threw the banking order 
into chaos, but there was also an excessive investment scale in 
capital construction and an excessive industrial growth rate, 
thus increasing the inflationary pressure. People were very 
worried about this and it was against this backdrop that a 
series of macroeconomic regulation and control measures was 
introduced. Compared with the situation last year, it should be 
said that the current economic situation in China and its 
development prospects are fairly bright. 
  First, the growth in investment has been curbed. Since the 
beginning of this year, the extent of state investment has 
dropped by 30.5 percentage points over the same period last 
year. The availability of funds for key projects, as well as 
the overall investment pattern, is better than last year. 
Through further efforts, the investment scale for the whole 
year can basically be kept within an anticipated scope. 
  Second, the banking situation remains stable. The currency 
which the banks put into circulation at the beginning of this 
year has been recovered and the savings deposits of urban and 
rural residents in the first four months of this year increased 
by over 130 billion yuan over the same period last year. By 
early May, over half of the task of issuing national banks had 
been accomplished. 
  Third, market prices are rising at a gradually reducing 
rate. 
Through such measures as stepping up supervision over the prices 
of daily necessities and service fees, practicing the method of 
selling at marked prices, and launching a general price 
inspection, the retail prices have risen at a markedly reduced 
rate. According to predictions by departments in charge of 
comprehensive economic management, the price index will drop 
still further in the second half of this year. 
  Fourth, the national economy is growing steadily. As the 
contradictions between supply and demand in communications, 
energy, and raw materials ease up and investment remains within 
a certain scope, there have been some changes in the shortages 
of circulating capital. Consequently, the economic growth rate 
will not be too low this year. According to initial predictions 
by a relevant department, the national economy will grow by 
about 12 percent in the first half of this year over the same 
period last year and the growth rate for the whole year will 
generally remain at about 10 percent. 
  Fifth, and a very important point, is that the economic 
reform has continuously deepened. A central leading comrade has 
used a vivid metaphor: China's economic restructuring has 
shifted from the demolition of an old house to the construction 
of a new one. The enterprise reform has moved from readjustment 
of the tax reduction and profit concession policy to the 
innovation of policies at a deeper level; the price reform has 
moved from the liberalization of commodity prices to the 
marketization of factor prices; and the construction of a market 
system has moved from the selective cultivation of a commodity 
market to a factor market. It can well be said that our reform 
today is being carried out in an orderly way in accordance with 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, the goal laid down by the 14th CPC 
National Congress and the blueprint sketched out at the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. 
  To sum up, everything has been done to cool down what should 
be cooled down, to heat up what should be heated up, to lower 
what should be lowered, and to raise what should be raised. 
These are precisely the fundamental bases for a correct 
understanding of the economic situation. When we push ahead 
with reform, opening up, and economic construction on such a 
basis, the vast numbers of cadres and masses will certainly have 
a firmer resolve and will keep on marching. 
  The current overall situation in reform and opening up is 
fairly good. However, the better the situation, the more we 
should keep a clear head and seriously solve the problems 
existing in the course of economic growth. Some time ago, 
people were quite concerned about whether inflation could be 
curbed. With the market and prices tending to stabilize, the 
difficulties of some state-owned enterprises in their operations 
and production have drawn people's attention again. How should 
we approach this? As we see it, beside taking the overall 
situation into account and grasping the situation of economic 
operations as a whole, we should also examine and analyze 
specific issues in light of the overall situation. 
  There are now two different one-sided views: The first is 
that state-owned enterprises are losing more money and their 
speed has reduced; the second is that the shortage of 
circulating capital has resulted in many enterprises suspending 
production. As for the first view, the relevant departments 
have made an analysis to the effect that, after the 
implementation of the new fiscal system and after many 
state-owned enterprises with good economic results have been 
turned into joint ventures or joint-stock enterprises, there 
have been changes in both the calculation methods and 
statistical specifications; in fact, the losses have not 
increased and nor has the speed reduced. As for the second 
view, the actual situation is: In the first four months of this 
year, the production in state-owned enterprises still grew at 
4.7 percent. As production and development are not at a 
standstill, how can there be a situation in which many 
enterprises have stopped or partially stopped production? If we 
judge the situation one-sidedly according to these arguments and 
relax controls over credits, it is likely that the circulating 
funds will again be diverted to investment in fixed assets, thus 
encouraging a new investment expansion, and the actual effect of 
macroeconomic regulation and control will probably come to 
naught. 
  It should be noted that some state-owned enterprises have 
indeed met with difficulties in their operations and production. 
The reasons have something to do with the structure and other 
aspects, such as excessive social burdens, unchanged product 
mix, and lax internal management. In essence, it is because the 
operation mechanism of some enterprises has not been fully 
changed or has not been changed at all. More often than not, 
the difficult point in economic development is the focus of 
reform. Only by accelerating the change of enterprise mechanism 
and of government functions will it be possible for state-owned 
enterprises to overcome, once and for all, some of their 
difficulties and for the economic situation to develop in a 
better direction. 
  Our country is in a very important stage of development. The 
task of deepening the reform is very arduous and it needs 
tremendous efforts to achieve the sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the national economy. Therefore, it is 
especially important to see the situation clearly and grasp the 
overall situation. To look is aimed at doing. It is hoped that 
the vast numbers of cadres, workers, and staff members on the 
economic front will rouse themselves, unite as one and, while 
focussing on the basic principle of seizing the opportune 
moment, deepening the reform, opening wider to the outside 
world, promoting development, and maintaining stability, seize 
new victories in socialist modernization with full confidence.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yali (0702 7161 7787): "Results of Appraisal of </F>
State-Owned Assets Nationwide Published"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 17 May (GUANGMING RIBAO)--Today, the 
National Administration of State Property published for the 
first time to the public the results of an appraisal of China's 
state-owned assets. As of the end of 1992 (1993 data are still 
being processed), China's state-owned assets had a total book 
value of 3,069.7 billion yuan (excluding resources assets and 
the state-owned assets of the armed forces and the armed police 
corps), representing an increase of 385.1 billion yuan over the 
2,684.6 billion yuan of the previous year or a growth rate of 
14.3 percent. 
  Of total state-owned assets, 47.5 percent were managed by 
units of the central authorities and 52.4 percent by the 
localities. Judging by the usage of state-owned assets, 72 
percent were operational assets and 28 percent were 
nonoperational assets, of which operational assets increased by 
13.1 percent. 
  Of total assets society-wide, state-owned assets had an 
absolute advantage. In important sectors such as energy, 
communications, banking, and foreign trade, over 90 percent of 
assets were held by state-owned enterprises. 
  Sectors in which state-owned assets increased comparatively 
quickly were industry, construction engineering, agriculture, 
and forestry. Their growth rate was 10 percentage points higher 
than the national average. State-owned assets in the real 
estate sector and in joint-stock enterprises increased by 69.8 
percent and 175.7 percent respectively, representing the fastest 
growth rates. 
  Shandong Province was the region where state-owned assets 
grew the quickest. In 1992, they grew by as much as 30.5 
percent. Next were the coastal regions of eastern China and 
southern China. The first 10 provinces and municipalities with 
the largest state-owned assets managed by localities were 
Guangdong (165.7 billion yuan), Jiangsu (103.2 billion yuan), 
Shandong (102.8 billion yuan), Liaoning (96.5 billion yuan), 
Sichuan (87.7 billion yuan), Shanghai (82.7 billion yuan), 
Beijing (79.2 billion yuan), Hubei (69.6 billion yuan), Hebei 
(66.3 billion yuan), and Zhejiang (62.5 billion yuan). 
  Moreover, state-owned enterprises have continuously improved 
their vitality. In 1992, state-owned enterprises across the 
country achieved taxes and profits totaling 329.1 billion yuan, 
an increase of 16 percent over the previous year, and they 
earned 117.6 billion yuan of profits, an increase of 11.3 
percent over the previous year. The 24.3 percent of state-owned 
enterprises incurring losses was a 7.3 point decrease from the 
31.6 percent of the previous year. The proportion of losses in 
operational returns decreased from 32.1 percent to 26.7 percent. 
Taxes and profits turned over by state-owned enterprises 
accounted for approximately two thirds of total budgetary income.

<F P=106> [By Ma Zhiping: "State Eases Rules on 102 Items"] </F>
  [Text] The main responsibility for the quality control of 
many industrial products is shifting away from the central 
government and more towards the enterprises themselves, as they 
increasingly hold their products up to international standards 
to compete in the market economy. 
  As part of this trend, the State Technical Supervision 
Bureau 
is lifting the requirement for production permits on 102 
categories of products beginning next month. This follows the 
move last June to abolish the permit requirement for an initial 
103 categories. 
  The production permit system was introduced 10 years ago to 
control the quality of industrial products. The manufacture of 
some 500 types of products has been placed under this form of 
State regulation. 
  "This is a move taken by the State to serve the development 
of the country's market economy and concentrate attention on the 
quality control of the most important products," said an 
official with the bureau, which is in charge of the country's 
quality control work. 
  By scaling back the system, the official explained, 
oversight 
can be even more effective for the remaining products that still 
require production permits. "Production permit control will be 
strictly imposed on those products which concern people's health 
and the safety of life and property," the official said. 
  For instance, the permit control imposed since 1990 on the 
production of disposable syringes, will continue. The poor 
quality of the syringes had caused widespread complaints, and 
the permit, system has improved the product's qualifying rate 
from 48 per cent to 89 per cent over the past four years, the 
official said.

  [Text] The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) 
has denied speculation that Liu Hongru will resign as chairman. 
Although no official statement has been issued, a commission 
spokeswoman said the State Council, China's Cabinet, had denied 
reports of Mr Liu stepping down from the job he has held since 
the CSRC was created in 1992. "We confirm that there is no news 
of Mr Liu's resignation. And this confirmation is from the 
State Council," she said, referring to the State Council 
Securities Policies Committee (SCSPC). The CSRC is an executive 
agency of SCSPC. 
  Reports of Mr Liu's departure have been in the Hong Kong 
media in the past few weeks. "Such reports will have an adverse 
impact on the stock market and they should not be issued without 
our confirmation," she added. 
  As the man most identified with China's stock markets, Mr 
Liu 
is instrumental in laying the groundwork for the historic 
listing of mainland corporations in Hong Kong. Another feather 
will be added to his cap when five of the 22 companies in the 
second batch of enterprises slated for overseas flotation head 
for Wall Street next year.

<F P=106> [By Ching Chi (5427 2765): "Many Foreign Businessmen </F>
Involved in Serious Tax Evasion Cases"] 
  [Text] Jin Xin, director of the State General 
Administration of Taxation, said a few days ago that more 
foreign-funded enterprises evade taxes in Shenzhen than in other 
parts of the country. Some 60 percent of the foreign-funded 
enterprises in Shenzhen were involved in tax evasion. 
  According to statistics provided by the World Bank, a total 
of $27 billion was channeled into China in 1993, making China 
the largest recipient of capital in the world. Though both 
China and foreign businessmen benefit from the investment, the 
evasion of taxes by foreign businessmen is surprising. 
  It is understood that foreign businessmen evade taxes mainly 
through diverting their profits, which in fact is nothing 
secret. Since foreign businessmen have purchasing and marketing 
rights, they can make enormous profits by importing raw and 
semi-finished materials at high prices and exporting their 
products at low prices. The strange prevailing situation is that 
although foreign-funded enterprises on the mainland only make 
small profits or operate at a loss every year, they carry on 
expanding at the same time. 
  Statistics released by the department concerned show the 
above malpractice of foreign-funded enterprises costs the 
mainland a loss of several billion U.S. dollars every year, 
which accounts for about one-third of foreign enterprises' total 
import-export volume in the same period. 
  Many foreign businessmen also falsely report the value of 
their equipment. Investigations into foreign enterprises' 
equipment carried out by a commodity inspection department 
reveal that most foreign businessmen have falsely reported the 
cost of their equipment. An appraisal by a certain commodity 
inspection department of 150 batches of equipment provided by 
foreign businessmen showed all the equipment had been converted 
into capital at price 28.8 percent higher than the actual prices. 
  Facts have told the Chinese Government that if the 
purchasing 
and marketing rights of foreign-invested or joint venture 
enterprises are in the hands of foreign businessmen, they would 
be controlled by foreign businessmen. 
  The Chinese side in a joint venture enterprise in East China 
producing sporting shoes for a famous U.S. brand was excited at 
first by the injection of several hundred thousand U.S. dollars 
by the foreign side, but the management announced six months 
after the enterprise went into operation that the enterprise had 
suffered a loss of 210,000 yuan incurred by exporting 100,000 
pairs of shoes to the United States. The workers were stunned 
by the news, but they finally discovered the secret. The 
selling price for a pair of shoes fixed by the foreign 
businessmen was $2.16, amounting to 11.23 yuan, but the 
production cost was 13.4 yuan, so 100,000 pairs of shoes cost 
the enterprise 210,000 yuan. However, the 100,000 pairs could 
bring a profit of $1.3 million in the U.S. market. 
  The Chinese side could not but say with feeling: Our own 
enterprises are not allowed to export products by ourselves, so 
we have to exploit marketing channels provided by the foreign 
side. An officer from the Foreign Affairs Taxation 
Administration under the State Administration of Taxation 
believes that it is necessary to set up a network providing 
information on prices as soon as possible. 
  To encourage foreign investment, China has formulated 
preferential policies. For example, foreign enterprises enjoy 
tax reductions and exemptions for five years beginning from the 
day they go into operation. A certain foreign-invested company 
in Fuzhou turned its two workshops into independent companies so 
that they could continue to enjoy tax reductions and exemptions 
when its tax reductions and exemptions were about to expire. 
  Such examples are numerous. Many foreign businessmen also 
falsely report their personal income to dodge tax. China's tax 
departments have taken various measures to recover evaded taxes. 
China's tax departments have reportedly individually examined 
over the last two years foreign-invested companies and foreign 
businessmen who have evaded taxes. In the Beijing region alone, 
130 persons from 40 companies were required to pay overdue taxes 
totaling six million yuan and arrears amounting to five million 
yuan were also recovered. 
  A cadre in charge of the Foreign Affairs Taxation 
Administration said that by straightening out taxation, the 
situation regarding income tax payments by foreigners in Beijing 
had greatly improved.

  [Text] Beijing, 7 Jun (XINHUA) -- The People's Bank of 
China, Agricultural Bank, and Industrial and Commercial Bank 
recently held a meeting in Beijing to report on the work of 
supplying funds for the purchase of summer grain and oil-bearing 
crops. Speaking at the meeting, Vice President of the People's 
Bank of China Dai Xianglong urged that all banks and relevant 
departments should prepare sufficient funds for the purchase of 
summer grain and oil-bearing crops in a timely manner so that 
farmers will not be given "IOU's." 
  Dai Xianglong called on all localities to seriously 
implement 
the responsibility system of supplying funds for the purchase of 
summer grain and oil-bearing crops. Under the unified 
leadership of governments at all levels, banks and relevant 
departments should ensure funds for the purchase of summer grain 
and oil-bearing crops. All branches of the People's Bank of 
China should supervise the supply of money in addition to 
coordinating the work of supplying purchasing funds. Before the 
end of June the supply and management of funds for the purchase 
of grain and oil-bearing crops will be the responsibility of the 
Agricultural Bank and Industrial and Commercial Bank. Beginning 
1 July, the Agricultural Bank will undertake sole responsibility 
for supply and management. 
  Dai Xianglong stressed: To ensure the needs for purchasing 
funds, all banks should strengthen unified management and ensure 
the orderly use of funds. The branches of specialized banks 
should ensure payment, ensure funds for the purchase of grain 
and oil-bearing crops in various localities, and grant other 
loans in accordance with plans and policies and the amount of 
available capital. Should there be a surplus of funds, it 
should be used under the unified management of banks of a higher 
level. He said: Serious efforts should be made to strengthen 
management to ensure the prompt supply of funds for the purchase 
of grain and oil-bearing crops and to prevent the diversion of 
purchasing funds for other purposes. Specialized banks and 
their branches, and the People's Bank should ensure their funds 
and short-term loans are first used for payment and purchasing 
of grain and oil-bearing crops. The People's Bank will allocate 
an additional sum of 6 billion yuan to the Agricultural Bank to 
be used for purchasing farm and sideline products. 
  Dai Xianglong pointed out: It is necessary to strengthen 
control over the size of purchasing funds. When funds for the 
purchase of state-controlled farm and sideline products such as 
grain and oil-bearing crops are insufficient, purchasing 
authorities may obtain loans first and report the borrowing to 
the state later. He also stressed: It is necessary to 
strengthen the management of markets for grain and oil-bearing 
crops in coordination with relevant departments by applying the 
means of credit and account settlement. Granting loans to 
support rush purchasing in other localities and selling and 
buying grain and oil-bearing crops outside the prescribed limits 
must be strictly prohibited. 
  In conclusion, Dai Xianglong urged all banks to do a good 
job 
in supplying and managing funds for the purchase of summer grain 
and oil-bearing crops, and to satisfy the farmers by avoiding 
the practice of writing "IOU'S" due a shortage of purchasing 
funds.

  [Text] The naming meeting for the Fourth Company of a unit 
under the command of the provincial military district on which 
the Nanjing Military Region conferred the title of honor of 
Coastal Defense Model Company was solemnly held in Jingjiang 
City yesterday. 
  Leaders of the Nanjing Military Region, the provincial party 
committee, the provincial military district including [Nanjing 
Military Region Political Commissar] Fang Zuqi, [Provincial 
Party Secretary] Jia Qinglin, [Provincial Military District 
Commander] Ren Yonggui, and [Provincial Military District 
Political Commissar] Sui Shengwu attended the meeting. 
  The Coastal Defense Company is a heroic company with a 
glorious tradition. During the war years, it won the title of 
honor of the Libao Battle Heroic Company. During the period of 
socialist construction, they were always advanced in the 
construction of all fields of endeavor. Particularly in recent 
years, always bearing our army's fundamental function in mind, 
they have conscientiously performed their duties, paid keen 
attention to the implementation of the strategic system, and 
made outstanding contributions in defending the motherland's 
coastal security and economic construction. Their advanced 
deeds are an embodiment of our party and Army's fine traditions 
and a revelation of the completely new style and features of the 
soldiers of a new generation. 
  On behalf of the Nanjing Military Region, Fang Zuqi warmly 
congratulated the Coastal Defense Model Company and hoped its 
officers and men would keep a cool head in the face of honors, 
persist in setting high and strict demands on themselves, strive 
to be really up to the mark in all fields, and set a good 
example for all the troops of the region. He also urged all the 
troops in the region to keep their heavy responsibilities firmly 
in mind; conduct, in an extensive and down-to-earth manner, the 
activities of striving to be an advanced company and outstanding 
soldiers; train more advanced units like the Gulangyu Good 
Eighth Company and the Coastal Defense Model Company; and strive 
comprehensively to uplift army building to a new level. 
  On behalf of the provincial party committee, government, and 
people across the province, provincial CPC Secretary Jia Qinglin 
attended and congratulated the company. He called on the cadres 
and people of the province to conduct extensive activities to 
learn from the Coastal Defense Model Company and to learn from 
their efforts to foster a correct world outlook and values, 
enhance dedication to the revolutionary cause and the sense of 
responsibility toward work, set high and strict demands, carry 
out work in a down-to-earth manner, and strive for first-rate 
achievements; learn also from their fine quality of strictly 
discharging their duties and building an enterprise through 
arduous efforts; and learn from their experience in 
strengthening ideological and political work in the new 
situation with a new mental outlook and new forms of activity. 
He urged that we should guide, protect, and give play to the 
enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and people and strive 
in our struggle for the development and rejuvenation of Fujian 
and the realization of our province's "three-step" strategic 
goal.

  [Text] Beijing, June 4 (XINHUA) -- Some 600 academicians 
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the newly-founded 
Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), China's two top scientific 
bodies, are meeting here to draw up a blueprint for China's 
scientific and technological development as well as to probe a 
road to national prosperity powered by science and technology. 
  During the grand gathering of the two academies, physicist 
Prof. Zhou Guangzhao, president of the CAS, told XINHUA about 
the strategic thinking of China's scientific and technological 
development. 
  He said that the advancement of modern productivity comes 
largely out of progress in science and technology. The key to 
the solution of problems plaguing China, such as those related 
to resources, the environment and development, lies in no more 
than science and technology. 
  "Only by relying on modern science and technology, can we 
create a productivity bringing good economic returns, high 
efficiency and sustainable development," said Zhou, a renowned 
theoretical physicist. 
  He said that China must base its scientific and 
technological 
developmental plan and strategy strictly on its real national 
conditions, as economies at different development stages call 
for different industrial and technological structures. 
  "Once any scientific and technological development scheme 
deviates from its corresponding economic development stage, it 
will have negative effects on economic growth as well as on the 
progress of science and technology itself," the professor said. 
  China's strategy for scientific and technological 
development 
must therefore be forward-looking and far-sighted in nature, and 
must serve the development of the upcoming economic stages, 
rather than a stage now passing, Zhou said. 
  He listed four basic facts which had to be taken into 
account 
when China draws up its scientific and technological development 
program: 
  -- Compared with developed countries, China is in an 
inferior 
position in terms of the overall economic strength and 
scientific and technological development level; 
  -- China's vast population, a lack of resources in per 
capita 
terms, and environmental deterioration have combined to cast a 
great burden on development, and will restrain development; 
  -- China's huge market and potential can push forward the 
world economy; 
  -- China's high savings rate, low salary standard and the 
fact that Chinese people are hard-working can create favorable 
conditions for capital accumulation and industrial development. 
  The first two facts indicate that development is an arduous 
task and a sustainable development is therefore ever more 
necessary. The other two facts have made it possible for China 
to utilize both domestic and foreign capital and technology, 
accelerate scientific, technological and industrial progress and 
achieve the relatively quick development, the academy president 
said. 
  Overall, China should adopt a strategy marked by sustained 
and coordinated development and get ready for a long-term 
economic battle, Zhou said. 
  Meanwhile, China must be ready and able to fight 
"quick-victory economic campaigns" in some specific domains, by 
pooling capital and manpower and leaping over some links and 
stages in the technical development process. This will help 
China achieve quick development, he explained. 
  In some of the world's emerging high-tech spheres, which 
have 
potentially immense impact on future industrial development, 
China should adopt a strategy with a mechanism that reacts 
swiftly and such a strategy must be supported by a guarantee of 
manpower, materials and funds, the professor stressed. 
  "In some selected spheres, China should strive to make 
breakthroughs by introducing market economy mechanism," he 
noted, adding that this was quite possible, especially in some 
high-tech fields that need limited funds but much intelligence. 
  Talking about scientific and technological competition 
worldwide, Zhou said that it is of little meaning to repeat past 
discoveries. 
  The Chinese scientific and technological community should 
tap 
the superiority and potential of research institutes and 
universities and colleges as well as encourage academic 
pace-setters, particularly young scholars and technicians, to 
set up comprehensive scientific research centers and compete in 
the most advanced frontiers of the world's science and 
technology kingdom. 
  However, he pointed out that China, as a big country with a 
still low economic, scientific and technological development 
level, would meet with ever intensifying international 
competitions in all spheres in its whole process of opening 
wider to the outside world. 
  "In these conditions, Chinese scientists, young scientists 
in 
particular, must get themselves well prepared and grasp all 
opportunities so as to win a foothold in the international 
scientific arena and eventually make contributions to our 
times," the president urged.

  [Text] Beijing, 4 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--An official 
of the Security Bureau of China National Nuclear Corporation 
recently said that in the past 40 years since the founding of 
China's nuclear industry, no environmental pollution incident 
had ever occurred; although China's nuclear industry developed 
later than in other countries, its operation had always been in 
a good condition. 
  According to the results of the "Assessment of Radiation 
Environmental Quality Over the Past 30 Years in China's Nuclear 
Industry," the average radiation level of the environment within 
80 kilometers around the nuclear facilities was just 0.01 
percent higher than the level of natural radiation [tian ran ben 
di zhao she 1131 3544 2609 1646 3564 1410], and the effect on 
the environment was extremely slight. 
  In the last 10 years, China's nuclear industry has made 
substantial progress in the management of radiation waste and 
the handling of the old nuclear facilities that were no longer 
in operation. At the same time, marked results were achieved in 
the establishment of perfect standards and regulations for 
environmental protection and in the aspect of international 
cooperation. 
  The official said: Along with the achievements, some 
problems also exist. For example, environmental monitoring was 
somewhat weakened, the quality of monitoring has declined 
somewhat, personnel and equipment are aging, the quality of the 
environment has to be further improved, and the professional 
quality of environmental protection personnel has to be further 
enhanced. 
  Reportedly, environmental protection work in China's nuclear 
industry is now focused on the handling of waste, and the 
management of nuclear waste is being strengthened. Laws and 
regulations will be enforced strictly, monitoring will be 
strengthened, modern means will be used to improve the process 
of environmental assessments so that the quality of the work in 
this regard will be enhanced, procedures will be simplified, the 
environmental protection industry will develop on a considerable 
scale, and personnel training will also be strengthened.

  [Text] Guangzhou, 4 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--According 
to sources in departments in charge of price administration in 
Guangzhou, the price index, which rose earlier this year, 
dropped by a wide margin recently. 
  The recent price index for Guangzhou City increased 17.5 
percent, which was 7.6 percentage points lower than last year's 
average. According to preliminary estimates from departments in 
charge of price administration, the index dropped nine percent 
or so in May, which was markedly lower than the average increase 
in prices in the first quarter of this year. The rising trend 
in the general level of retail commodity prices has slowed down. 
Retail prices of a number of nonstaple foodstuffs and 
industrial products for daily use are lower than in the same 
period last year. 
  In order to deal with such problems as the production of 
fake 
and inferior goods, reaping staggering profits, asking 
exorbitant prices, and monopolizing the market, and to 
standardize pricing behavior, from 6 June on, departments in 
charge of the commodity price inspection in the city will 
strengthen the administration of work encouraging sales at 
marked prices and will punish, in strict accordance with laws 
and regulations, units and individuals who do not sell 
commodities at marked prices in a standardized manner. The 
practice of unreasonable charges levied in the service sector 
will be punished according to provincial regulations on the 
administration of executive charges, state regulations on price 
administration, and other laws and regulations.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Foreign Firms Compete To Bid for More </F>
Than 20 Underground Railway Projects"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 1 Jun (LIEN HO PAO) -- Following the 
expansion of the underground railway systems in Beijing, 
Shanghai, and Tianjin, over 20 large and medium-sized cities, 
including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Changchun, Chengdu, Nanjing, 
Qingdao, and Lanzhou have recently sought cooperation with 
foreign firms in preparation for the construction of underground 
railways. 
  The Guangzhou underground railway project has been under 
preparation for a long time. Construction of the 18.45-km No. 1 
line began at the end of last year. The whole project is 
expected to be completed by 1998. It will be the city's biggest 
ever investment in urban construction. The total investment is 
estimated at over 10 billion yuan. The No. 1 line requires 
about $1 billion of investment, half of which is foreign 
capital. Equipment for the 16 stations is being imported from a 
number of countries and is worth a total of $440 million. In 
order to minimize the impact on surface communications and the 
public's life, an advanced method, quality structure [zhi gou 
6347 2845] construction, was adopted. An invitation to tender 
for the Guangzhou underground was held. Nine companies from 
Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and the Republic of 
Korea signed up for the bidding. They included Balfour Beatty 
of Britain, CMC of Italy, Holtzmann [huo er zi man 7202 1422 
5417 2581] of Germany, Maeda Construction Limited of Japan, and 
Matiquer [ma di ke er 7456 5530 0344 1422] of France. 
  The right to supply 15 mechanical and electrical systems 
required by the No. 1 line attracted great interest from foreign 
firms, which engaged one another in competition: Last November, 
Germany's Siemens took the lead and became the supplier of five 
equipment systems, including rolling stock and vehicle-related 
equipment; the United States' (Puller) [pu le si 2528 2867 2448] 
and (Kelly) [kai li 7030 0448] and Britain's Balfour Beatty and 
General Electric Company (Hong Kong) Limited became the 
suppliers of six equipment systems, including emergency alarms, 
cold-water generating units, overhead contact nets, and fans. 
Japanese firms beat their rivals to supply two systems. 
Mitsubishi Electric Corporation and Hitachi became suppliers of 
escalators for the No. 1 line. America's Cobic [kou bi ke 1379 
3024 0344] Automatic Ticket Seller &amp; Checker Group became the 
supplier of automatic ticket vendors. So far, suppliers for 13 
of 15 equipment systems have been designated.

  [Text] Haikou, June 7 (CNS) -- The Hainan University, the 
highest learning institution in Hainan Province, with the 
approval of the provincial government, will abolish the 
dual-enrolment system, namely, "studying at one's own expense" 
and "studying at public expense" this year. All freshmen have 
to pay for their education. 
  Fees for education in this university differ according to 
what subject one majors in. Nine popular subjects including 
architectural engineering and international finance have their 
annual school fees set at RMB [renminbi] 2200 per student while 
other subjects including agriculture, teacher training and 
navigation are still free of charge and, instead, stipends for 
the students majoring in these subjects are available. 
  In addition, a system of scholarship and loans for study has 
been established in order to encourage students to devote 
themselves to study and ensure poor students can finish their 
course. Scholarships are sponsored by overseas Chinese and some 
entrepreneurs. 
  The university will grant monthly living allowances of 60 
yuan to all students, who also enjoy free medical care. Good 
students who have financial difficulties will be entitled to 
reductions or exemption of school fees. They can also apply for 
a loan specially set for them. The interest-free loan will be 
divided into three kinds with a respective annual amount of RMB 
1000, RMB 800 and RMB 600.

  [Text] Macao, 7 Jun (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Chen Ziying, 
deputy director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, said here today that the British side is not 
cooperating in the political area but China will still cooperate 
as much as possible with the British side in other areas. The 
matter hinges on the British side. Concerning the talks on Hong 
Kong's new airport, he hopes that progress can be made and an 
important breakthrough achieved. 
  Chen Ziying said that regarding the Hong Kong question, 
China 
has always advocated Sino-British cooperation because it is 
conducive to Hong Kong's smooth transition. Although the 
British side is not cooperating in the political area he hopes 
that, in other areas, it will not repeat the methods used in the 
political area. In other areas, we will try our best to 
cooperate with the British side. China's attitude has always 
been clear and we have made efforts in this regard and the 
matter rests with the other side. 
  Talking about the issue of Hong Kong's new airport, Chen 
Ziying said that along with Hong Kong's economic development, a 
new airport should be built and everyone had identical views on 
this. He said: Concerning the issue of Hong Kong's new airport, 
we think that things should be done according to the regulations 
stipulated by the original Memorandum of Understanding on the 
Airport and no extra financial burdens should be created for the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR]. In order to 
protect the interests of Hong Kong residents, and in order not 
to create extra financial burdens for the Hong Kong SAR, we have 
negotiated with the British side. Concerning this question, the 
Chinese side has never raised any extra demands; we have only 
one thing to say: Act according to the Memorandum of 
Understanding on the Airport. 
  Chen Ziying said that China is positive and enthusiastic 
about the airport talks and hopes that the talks on the new 
airport make progress and an important breakthrough is achieved 
as soon as possible.

  [Text] Beijing, June 8 KYODO -- Chinese police have 
released a dissident in Fuzhou, Fujian Province after detaining 
him during the June 4 anniversary of the crushing of 
pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989, the 
dissident said Wednesday [8 Jun]. 
  Lin Xinshu, 51, interviewed by telephone, said he believes 
his four-day detention was due to a letter he and nine other 
Fuzhou intellectuals and students sent in late May to the 
Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. 
  The letter called for the resignation of Premier Li Peng, 
the 
promotion to prime minister of Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and for 
compensation for those killed when the Chinese Army opened fire 
upon unarmed citizens in the streets of Beijing in 1989. 
  Lin was picked up by plainclothes police on June 2 and 
released Monday, he said. He did not know the whereabouts of 
the other nine signatories. 
  He was forced into exile in Fuzhou from his native Beijing 
in 
1992 and has been detained six times since the 1989 
pro-democracy protests, he said. 
  Three previous letters he sent to the central committee 
demanded the resignation of Li, who signed the martial law order 
of May 1989, Lin said. The letters also called for the 
rehabilitation of ousted Communist Party general secretary Zhao 
Ziyang, he said. 
  The Chinese Government in March ordered a nationwide 
crackdown on political dissent aimed at weeding out those who 
are opposed to the official verdict that the peaceful 
demonstrations in 1989 was a "counterrevolutionary rebellion."

<F P=106> [By Ma Chenguang: "Inventions by Inmates To Help Society"] </F>
  [Text] Talented inmates in China's prisons and labour camps 
are being encouraged to develop inventions and technological 
innovations. 
  The move is to increase the social responsibility of 
prisoners and turn them into useful citizens, said Zhang Yuhua, 
spokeswoman for the Ministry of Justice yesterday. 
  The inventions and innovations will be used to help prison 
work or sold to enterprises outside the jails, said Zhang. 
  Some of the inventions have already received Chinese patent 
rights, she added. 
  And in return for their creations, many inventors will have 
their prison sentences reduced. 
  The move is part of the prison reforms and aims to encourage 
inmates to contribute more to the national economic drive and 
better prepare them for life after prison. 
  A large number of talented inmates are former managers and 
technicians who committed economic crimes. 
  At the moment there are 1.25 million prisoners in China's 
680 
jails and labour camps. 
  In Shanghai, prisoners in the Municipal Prison have been 
taking part in the invention and technical innovation drive 
since 1992. 
  Last year, eleven inventions and 56 of the technical 
innovations developed by inmates from the prison were given 
State and municipal prizes. 
  And five inventions received State patents. 
  In East China's Shandong Province, the No. 1 Provincial 
Prison located in Jinan also embarked on a drive to develop 
prisoners' inventions. 
  Over the past few years, the jail has conferred the title of 
senior engineer to one prisoner, and named 56 others engineers, 
assistant engineers and technicians. 
  The senior engineer was the first in the province to get 
such 
a title. 
  He is now developing further technical innovations in the 
prison's workshop together with several apprentices.

  [Text] The president of China Northwest Airlines will 
resign to take the blame for China's worst air accident, airline 
sources said yesterday. Gao Junyue expressed his desire to 
resign to civil aviation officials who are in Xian investigating 
Monday's crash, which killed 160 people. Gao was told the 
resignation would not be accepted until a preliminary 
investigation reports whether the accident was a result of poor 
maintenance. 
  The revelation came as the identities of four Hong Kong 
people, including a prominent Sydney businesswoman, were 
released yesterday and workers recovered the aircraft's flight 
recorder. The official Hong Kong China News Agency said last 
night the Xian disaster showed China's poor air safety situation 
had not improved, despite a new leadership in the Civil Aviation 
Administration of China (CAAC). The CAAC's deputy director, Yan 
Zhixiang, said the air safety situation in China remained "grim". 
  The rapid tendering of Gao's resignation is a result of 
agreements signed by all airline presidents in March, sources 
said. When presiding over his first national aviation safety 
meeting, China's new aviation chief, Chen Guangyi, forced 
airline presidents to sign agreements promising to "take 
personal responsibility for any crashes". "I signed, so I must 
be responsible," Gao was reported to have said yesterday. The 
vice-president of the airline, Wang Wancai, who is in charge of 
flight operations, is expected to replace Gao. 
  The Russian-built Tupolev TU-154M crashed at about 8.20am in 
Changan county, minutes after leaving Xian. It is believed 
there was an engine failure and the pilot was trying to return 
to Xian when two explosions tore the aircraft apart. 
  Airline officials identified three of-the Hong Kong victims 
as Lau Chi-cheung, Chu Ym-ming and Mak Hong, all males. Their 
ages ranged from 35 to 70. An immigration spokeswoman, Tammy 
Keung, said the department was able to contact relatives of the 
three Hong Kong residents. The families left for Xian 
yesterday. The fourth Hong Kong victim was a businesswoman, 
Margaret Shen Beaumont, an Australian national who was born in 
the territory and lived in Sydney. Her family in Australia is 
expected to leave for China this week. 
  Other victims include a Taiwanese, an Italian couple and 
their two children, aged nine and 10, two Americans, and two 
male British tourists. Chinese authorities said all the bodies 
had been recovered. 
  Shen, a prominent member of Sydney's business community, had 
been visiting a friend in Xian and was to have joined an 
Australian trade delegation in Guangzhou before the group, led 
by the New South Wales Premier, John Fahey, travelled to Beijing 
yesterday. Fahey expressed his condolences yesterday and said 
he was "shocked and saddened" by Shen's death. 
  A spokesman for Fahey said Shen, who travelled to China 
frequently on business, was to have joined the delegation as an 
adviser because she co-owned a business in Guangzhou. The 
airline notified Fahey, who spoke with Shen's step-father, a 
retired senior Hong Kong police officer now living in Sydney. 
Shen, whose family owned the Noble House Chinese restaurant in 
Sydney, is survived by a daughter and a grand-daughter.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Xu Rujun (1776 1172 0193) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Hu Qinghai (5170 3237 3189)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 7 Jun (XINHUA) -- The Work Committee for 
CPC Central Committee Organs held a work conference on 
ideological and political work in Beijing today. Work Committee 
Secretary Zeng Qinghong pointed out at the meeting: Ideological 
and political work plays an important role in the party's entire 
cause. It is a crucial link that helps transform the party's 
line, principles, and policy into the masses' action of 
consciousness, an important approach that helps unite the masses 
of people and arouse their initiative, and a vital force and 
important guarantee for the smooth progress of revolution and 
construction. 
  Zeng Qinghong said: Paying high regard to ideological and 
political work and giving full play to the role of ideological 
and political work is our party's fine tradition and politically 
strong points. As the administrative body of the CPC Central 
Committee, CPC Central Committee organs shoulder important 
responsibilities for formulating and carrying out the party's 
line, principles, and policy and play an important pivotal role 
in the party's cause. The position and role of the CPC Central 
Committee organs set higher and stricter demands on the masses 
of cadres and personnel in terms of politics, work style, and 
administration. 
  Zeng Qinghong demanded that the ideological and political 
work of the CPC Central Committee organs must be guided by 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line and closely 
centered around the party's central tasks. The CPC Central 
Committee organs must make efforts in ideological and political 
work to meet the needs of the developing circumstances and 
closely integrate it with administrative affairs of various 
departments and units. They must conscientiously strengthen 
ideological education; improve overall quality of their cadres 
and personnel; and cultivate a team of cadres and personnel who 
are promising, moral, cultured, and self-disciplined. They must 
fully arouse the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativeness of 
cadres and personnel; ensure the completion of various tasks in 
their departments and units; and serve the deepening of reform, 
promoting of development, and maintaining of stability. 
  Zeng Qinghong said emphatically: To arm the entire party 
with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics is a major task of party building in the 
new period and a major task of the ideological and political 
work in the new situation. The fundamental goal of the CPC 
Central Committee organs' ideological and political work is to 
unite the ideology of the masses of cadres and personnel with 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line. Party 
organizations at all levels in CPC Central Committee organs must 
conscientiously and carefully study the theory in an in-depth 
manner. He added: Comrade Deng Xiaoping made a series of 
important expositions on the ideological and political work in 
the new period. These expositions have substantial content, 
deep intention, and distinct features of the times. These 
expositions are an important part of his theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. The masses of party 
members and cadres, especially those who are involved in 
ideological and political work, must conscientiously study these 
expositions, grasp their essence, and use these expositions as a 
guide to their work. 
  Gu Yunfei, deputy secretary of the Work Committee for CPC 
Central Committee Organs, presided over the meeting.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Guiding the People With Correct Public Opinions </F>
-- In Commemoration of the 45th Founding Anniversary of JIEFANG 
RIBAO"] 
  [Text] While Shanghai people are jointly celebrating the 
45th anniversary of Shanghai's liberation, JIEFANG RIBAO is 
greeting its 45th founding anniversary. It is particularly 
cheerful that General Secretary Jiang Zemin has written an 
inscription for us: "Guiding the People With Correct Public 
Opinions." This is a direction that the general secretary has 
pointed out for us, as well as an inspiration and encouragement 
to us. 
  "Guiding the people with correct public opinions" is JIEFANG 
RIBAO's fundamental mission and the most important task and, as 
an official party newspaper, we will not shrink from our 
responsibility. "Guiding the people with correct public 
opinion" is a pressing need for seizing the opportunity; 
deepening reform; opening up wider to the outside world; 
promoting development; maintaining stability; unifying the 
people; lifting spirits; inspiring fighting will; enhancing 
unity; and nurturing and cultivating a new type of socialist 
citizen who has high ideals, moral integrity, a better 
education, and a strong sense of discipline. Presently, the 
efforts of establishing a socialist market economic structure 
are storming ahead as a whole and have made breakthroughs in 
some key localities around China. This is a great change and it 
certainly requires further emancipation of minds and renewal of 
concepts. 
  To guide the people with correct public opinions, we must 
make the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics our basic guide and uphold the principle of 
serving the people and socialism; this is an official party 
newspaper's overall display of its adherence to the principle of 
the party's spirit. From discussions about the criteria of 
truth to Comrade Xiaoping's important talk during his south 
China inspection tour, we have profoundly felt, in the course of 
running this newspaper, that the theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics is the driving force for reform, 
development, and stability. We should popularize Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics in a scientific, overall, precise, and lively 
way and with high political enthusiasm. For the fundamental 
interests of the party and people, media propaganda should 
always unswervingly uphold the party's basic line; consciously 
subject itself to and serve the central work of economic 
construction; adhere to the principle of unity, stability, 
encouragement, and mainly making positive propaganda; and 
guiding the people's attention and creativity to the overall 
situation with socialist modernization drive as the focus. 
  To guide the people with correct public opinions, we should 
popularize, support, and promote reform in a clear-cut manner to 
create a good media environment for the establishment of a new 
socialist market economic structure. Presently, Shanghai should 
take the lead in setting up a socialist market economic 
operating mechanism, while the Shanghai people are striving for 
the fulfillment of the strategic goal -- becoming "a leader of 
the Chang Jiang valley and a financial, trade, and shipping 
center." We should proceed from Shanghai's new historic 
position and be good at discovering and summing up new things 
and experiences created and found by the broad masses of cadres 
and people in practicing reform. 
  To guide the people with correct public opinions, we should 
always eulogize the main theme of patriotism, collectivism, and 
socialism; intensify the construction of socialist civilization; 
improve people's quality; raise the level of civilization in 
cities; and promote the overall progress in the society. As a 
part of the mass media and a textbook for the people, newspapers 
should not only guide the people in acquiring correct outlooks 
on the world, life, and values, but also transmit messages; pass 
on knowledge; offer guidance on life, consumption, and 
entertainment; and let the style of socialist spiritual 
civilization permeate through every page of the newspapers, so 
that they will become good instructors and friends of the people. 
  Guiding the people with correct public opinions, we should 
correctly play a supervisory role in a bid to carry out a 
resolute struggle against ill practices, bad behaviors, as well 
as negative and corruptive phenomena. As a party paper, we 
serve as a party mouthpiece and represent the people's opinions. 
While sticking to the role as a party mouthpiece, we should 
also adhere to our stance as the people's servant, reflect the 
masses' weal and woe, uphold social justice, play a supervisory 
role by using the great power of public opinion and courageously 
exposing corruptive behaviors and adverse phenomena that damage 
the interests of the party and the people and smear Shanghai's 
image. In this way, we can cleanse all the trashes. 
  Guiding the people with correct public opinions, we should 
strive to make our paper full of life so that our readers, who 
are our close friends, will like to read it and trust it. The 
task requires us to improve our paper. In the light of adhering 
to the party spirit, we should pay more attention to such 
aspects as informativeness, knowledge, service, and timeliness. 
We should bring our paper closer to the masses, to social 
realities, and to people's daily lives by being more humanistic 
and warmhearted. In recent years, our paper has increased the 
number of its pages from four to eight and then from eight to 
12. On top of that, we issue color editions during the weekend. 
Every year, we come up with new treats because we want to 
provide our readers with a paper that is high in quality, 
informative in content, and attractive to the people. We have 
tried every possible way to meet the needs of our readers and 
provide them better service. 
  In the final analysis, guiding the people with correct 
public 
opinions requires a good contingent of journalists. The 
fundamental key to maintaining a correct orientation of public 
opinions lies in building a good contingent of journalists. It 
is impossible to have a correct orientation of public opinions 
if such a contingent is corrupt. It is also difficult to do 
splendid propaganda work if such a contingent is of poor 
quality. We must conscientiously carry out the guiding spirit 
of the National Meeting on Propaganda and Ideological Work to 
build a contingent of journalists that is high in political 
awareness, professionally competent, upright in work style, 
ambitious in career, and has a pioneering spirit. In this way, 
we can serve as a herald for the drive of reform, opening up, 
and economic development and provide ample and colorful 
nourishment for the mind. 
  The key to guiding the people with correct public opinions 
lies in strengthening the party's leadership over media work. 
Over the past 15 years since the Third Plenary Session of the 
11th CPC Central Committee and particularly since Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping delivered the important speeches during his south China 
inspection trip and the 14th National CPC Congress, the driving 
forces -- deriving their momentum from the emancipation of the 
mind, from the drive of reform and opening up, and from Pudong's 
development and its opening up to the outside world -- have 
invigorated the Pujiang's two banks. The country's prosperity 
makes all newspapers prosperous. The drive of reform and

  [Text] Beijing, June 3 (XINHUA) -- The Information Office 
of the State Council has released a white paper entitled "The 
Situation of Chinese Women". The full text of the white paper 
follows: 
<H5>  Foreword </H5>
  In March 1992, the United Nations decided to hold in 1995 
the 
Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, the capital of 
China. This has aroused greater world attention on the status of 
Chinese women. 
  In the feudal society which lasted several millennia and the 
subsequent century of semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, 
Chinese women experienced a bitter history of prolonged 
oppression, degradation and abasement. From the first half of 
this century, masses of women plunged into an undaunted and 
heroic struggle lasting several decades under the leadership of 
the Communist Party of China. This was a quest for national 
liberation and their own emancipation. It was not until the 
founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 that Chinese 
women, who make up one-fourth of their sex in the world, finally 
won their historic freedom. 
  New China proclaimed that Chinese women enjoy equal rights 
with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, social 
and family life and that they have become, like all Chinese 
citizens, masters of the state and society. Chinese laws 
guarantee that women and men enjoy the same rights and status 
and have equal personal dignity. The Chinese Government employs 
legal, administrative and educational means to eliminate all 
kinds of discrimination against women and protect their special 
rights and interests. Today, as an important token of 
civilization and progress, Chinese women enjoy the equal rights 
which had remained unattainable in Chinese society over 
millennia and which only became accepted in many developed 
countries after some centuries. 
  Under the socialist system, the once-stifled wisdom and 
talents of Chinese women have been released to a great extent. 
Women are actively plunging into China's social development as 
masters of society, becoming a great force in both economic 
construction and cultural and ideological advances. They are a 
vital force in China's reform and opening to the outside world 
and the modernization drive. Women have made extremely 
important contributions in various undertakings, including 
industrial and agricultural production, science, culture, 
education and health care. In China, the expression "women hold 
up half the sky" has become the most vivid expression the entire 
society uses to praise the role played by women. 
  While women's impetus for social development has been 
forming, great changes have taken place in their mental outlook. 
They have gained a sense of self-respect, self-confidence, 
self-reliance and self-strengthening and have taken long strides 
forward in their ability to participate in government and 
political affairs, in their cultural accomplishment, level of 
scientific knowledge and production skills. 
  Chinese women have a glorious peace-loving tradition. They 
have never forgotten the calamities caused by aggressive wars 
and rendered resolute support for the foreign policy of peace 
adopted by the Chinese Government. No matter what clashes might 
break out in the world, they always stand on the side of justice 
and the victims of aggression and oppose violence and 
aggression. Chinese women are an important force in 
safeguarding world peace. 
  Over the past 45 years, especially in the 15 years since the 
introduction of reform and opening to the outside world, Chinese 
women have achieved truly historic advances toward the goal of 
"equality, development and peace". This great forward march is 
an important component of the progressive cause of women 
worldwide; it is also an important part of the progress China 
has made in human rights. 
  China is a developing country. Owning to the constraints of 
social development and the influence of old concepts, the 
condition of Chinese women is still not wholly satisfactory. 
There exist various difficulties and resistance which have 
prevented the full realization of equal rights to women with 
respect to their participation in political and government 
affairs, employment, access to education, as well as marriage 
and family. Instances of looking down upon and discrimination 
against women and even infringement of their rights still occur 
from time time [as received]. On the other hand, the overall 
competence of women remains to be further enhanced. All these 
account for the fact that the road toward emancipation and 
progress for Chinese women has not reached its end. The Chinese 
Government is making every effort to develop the economy, 
strengthen the legal system, eradicate all backward ideas of 
discriminating against and looking down on women and promote 
equal rights for men and women in all spheres of social life as 
stipulated in Chinese law. This will speed the realization of 
the various development goals of the Nairobi strategies [the 
Nairobi Forward-Looking strategies for the Advancement of Women 
to the Year 2000] in China before the end of this century. 
  The Chinese Government, Chinese women and Chinese people as 
a 
whole warmly welcome the convocation of the Fourth World 
Conference on Women in Beijing. They are going all out to make 
comprehensive preparations for the congress. To enable the 
international community to acquire a better understanding of the 
condition of women in the host country, we have prepared this 
report for release to the world. 
  Chapter I -- Historic Liberation of Chinese Women 
  In semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China, women were for a 
long time kept at the bottom of society. It was not until the 
first half of this century that the Chinese Communist Party led 
the Chinese people to wage a great and profound national 
democratic revolution on this ancient land. At the same time, 
a large-scale women's emancipation movement was launched, 
resulting in the historic liberation of Chinese women which won 
worldwide attention. 
  The impact of the several millennia of oppression and 
devastation imposed by the feudal patriarchal system on Chinese 
women was exceptionally grave. In political, economic, 
cultural, social and family life, women were considered inferior 
to men. This was profoundly manifested in the following ways: 
  Possessing no political rights, women were completely 
excluded from social and political life. Economically 
dependent, women were robbed of property and inheritance rights 
and possessed no independent source of income. Having no social 
status, women were forced to obey their fathers before marriage, 
their husbands after marriage and their sons if they became 
widowed. They had no personal dignity or independent status, 
and were deprived of the right to receive an education and take 
part in social activities. They enjoyed no freedom in marriage 
but had to obey the dictates of their parents and heed the words 
of matchmakers, and were not allowed to remarry if their spouse 
died. They were subjected to physical and mental torture, being 
harassed by systems of polygamy and prostitution, the 
overwhelming majority of them forced to bind their feet from 
childhood. For centuries, "women with bound feet" was a synonym 
for the female gender in China. 
  The successive invasions by the Western powers after the 
Opium War in 1840 aggravated the plight of Chinese women. In 
the full-scale war of aggression launched by Japan against China 
from 1937 on, most of the over 30 million Chinese who were 
brutally killed were women and children. Within a month after 
the Japanese troops occupied Nanjing, they committed over 20,000 
rapes. The cruel oppression and exploitation of the Chinese 
people by imperialist and feudalist forces as well as 
bureaucratic capitalism pushed China to the brink of national 
subjugation and annihilation. It also plunged Chinese women 
into an abyss of misery never witnessed before. 
  For national salvation and self emancipation, Chinese women, 
along with the entire nation, waged a dauntless struggle that 
lasted for over a century. They also launched a succession of 
movements for women's liberation. The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom 
enacted and promulgated a series of policies on sexual equality. 
The Reform Movement of 1898 advocated and ignited the wave to 
ban feet binding and establish schools for women. The 1911 
Revolution kindled a feminist movement which focused on equal 
rights for men and women and participation by women in political 
affairs. These movements promoted the awakening of Chinese 
women. Nevertheless, they all failed to bring about a 
fundamental change in their miserable plight as victims of 
oppression and enslavement. 
  Ever since its birth, the Chinese Communist Party has made 
the achievement of female emancipation and equality between men 
and women one of its goals. Under the leadership of the Party, 
women were mobilized and organized to form a broad united front 
with working women in industry and agriculture as the main body. 
Women of all ethnic groups and walks of life united to stage 
popular women's liberation movements closely tied to the Chinese 
revolution. In Communist Party-led base areas in particular, the 
revolutionary political powers issued a series of decrees and 
regulations to ensure the rights of women and raise their 
status. This brought light and hope to women throughout the 
country. 
  For the women of China, the founding of the People's 
Republic 
of China ended the thousands of years of feudal oppression and 
enslavement and the history of being trampled and bullied by 
foreign aggressors. With an entirely new face, they have stood 
up and become the masters of New China like all citizens of the 
country. In 1949, the First Plenary Session of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference was convened in 
Beijing. The 69 women present accounted for 10.4 percent of the 
delegates. They represented women throughout the country in 
discussions together with men delegates on matters of vital 
importance for the country's construction. At the conference, 
Soong Ching Ling was elected vice- chairperson of the Central 
People's Government. Li Dequan, Shi Liang and some other women 
were also placed in leading posts in the government. The 
Common Program, adopted by the conference which had the nature 
of a provisional constitution, solemnly declared the toppling of 
the feudal system which fettered women and stated that women 
enjoyed equal rights with men in the political, economic, 
cultural and educational fields and in other aspects of social 
life. Thus a new era in the emancipation of Chinese women was 
ushered in. 
  After the founding of the People's Republic, there was a 
surge of mass movements throughout the country to quickly change 
the backward economic and cultural outlook left over by old 
China and eradicate the antiquated system and outmoded customs 
that fettered, discriminated against and humiliated women. This 
effected an earth-shaking historic change in the social status 
and condition of women. 
  -- Land reform. In old China, poor farmers and farm 
laborers who accounted for 70 percent of the rural population, 
owned only 10 percent of the land. Women had no right to own 
any land. In the very early days of the People's Republic, a 
widespread and profound land reform movement was carried out, in 
accordance with the principle of distributing land on the basis 
of the number of members in a family. Rural women obtained 
land, just like their male counterparts, and became masters of 
their piece of soil. This fundamentally altered the situation 
of economic inequality between men and women. 
  -- Universal balloting. The Electoral Law of the People's 
Republic of China promulgated in 1953 clearly stipulated that 
women enjoy the same rights to vote and stand for election as 
men. The subsequent elections conducted at grass-roots levels 
nationwide in December that year were the first large-scale 
general ballot in Chinese history. More than 90 percent of 
women cast their vote, and the number of women people's deputies 
elected at grass-roots levels accounted for 17 percent of the 
total. Among the deputies to the National People's Congress, 
elected somewhat later, women made up 12 percent, with females 
accounting for 11 percent of all representatives from ethnic 
minorities. This indicates that ever since the founding of the 
People's Republic, the participation of women of all ethnic 
groups in state administration has been not only written into 
the law but also an actual practice. In some Western countries, 
only one or two centuries after their founding, did the law 
stipulate that women had equal voting rights with men. 
  -- The move out of the home. Along with the economic 
rehabilitation and development, there appeared a nationwide 
upsurge of women stepping out of their homes to take part in 
social production. In 1957, around 70 percent of rural women 
engaged in agricultural work, and the number of urban women 
workers and staff reached 3.286 million, representing a 5.5-fold 
increase over 1949. This thoroughly transformed the situation in 
which women were excluded from social productive labor, 
providing them with an independent source of income. 
  -- Illiteracy eradication campaign. In old China, as many as 
90 percent of women were illiterate. In order to raise the 
cultural level of the entire nation, New China launched a 
planned campaign to gradually wipe out illiteracy. The mass 
campaign witnessed three upsurges in 1952, 1956 and 1958. 
Various literacy classes, popular evening schools and workers' 
spare-time schools mushroomed in both rural and urban areas, and 
women attended these in their millions. By 1958, 16 million 
women had learned to read, and this represented an initial step 
in eradicating the ignorance and backwardness of Chinese women. 
  -- Publicity and implementation of the Marriage Law. The 
Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, promulgated in 
1950, was the first statute enacted by New China. It clearly 
declared the abolition of the feudal marriage system 
characterized by arranged and forced marriage, male superiority 
and female inferiority, and disregard for the interests of 
children. Implementation of the new system was marked by 
freedom for both men and women in marriage, monogamy, sexual 
equality and protection of the legitimate rights of women and 
children. This signified a profound revolution in the patterns 
of wedded and family life that had prevailed for several 
thousand years in Chinese society. In the months that followed 
the law's promulgation, a large-scale mass campaign was staged 
throughout the country to publicize and implement the Marriage 
Law. This action resulted in the annulment of numerous feudal 
engagements, a rapid reduction in wife bashing and maltreatment, 
and freely chosen love marriages became prevalent. Through 
several years of hard work, the shackles imposed upon women by 
the millennia-old feudal marriage system was smashed and freedom 
of marriage was basically established. 
  -- Ban on prostitution. Brothels, prostitution and whoring 
were among the disgusting social phenomena left over by old 
China. Immediately after its founding, New China adopted 
resolute measures to outlaw prostitution. In November 1949, the 
Second Beijing Municipal People's Congress took the lead in 
adopting a decision to ban prostitution. The municipal 
government immediately closed all brothels and gathered 
prostitutes in designated places where they could be educated, 
have their thinking reformed, receive treatment for venereal 
diseases, and be provided with guidance to help them start 
normal lives and support themselves through their own work. 
Following the example of Beijing, all large, medium-sized and 
small cities in the country, including Shanghai and Tianjin, 
waged campaigns to wipe out prostitution. In a very short 
period of time, the sale of sex, a chronic social malady that 
seemed impossible to eradicate in old China and which seriously 
damaged the physical and mental health of women and degraded 
their dignity, disappeared, enabling society to take on a 
brand-new outlook. 
  By means of these large-scale mass movements, New China took 
only a few years to clean up the filth and mire left over from a 
feudal society that had lasted for thousands of years. It 
effected fundamental emancipation for women in all aspects of 
political, economic, cultural, social and family life. This 
represented a significant transformation in the history of 
contemporary social development that China can be proud of. It 
was also an important contribution made by the Chinese 
revolution to the worldwide movement for women's liberation. 
  Chapter II -- Equal Legal Status 
  China attaches great importance to providing legal 
protection 
to females. Women enjoy equal legal status with men. Now, a 
comprehensive legal system has come into being to protect the 
rights and interests of women and promote sexual equality. It 
takes the Constitution as the basis and the Law on the 
Protection of Rights and Interests of Women as the core, and 
encompasses various specific state laws and regulations, 
administrative decrees and regulations enacted by various 
government departments, and local legislation. 
  The basic principles in China's legislative work concerning 
women are equal rights for men and women, protection of the 
special rights and interests of women, and the banning of any 
discrimination, maltreatment and persecution directed at women. 
The Constitution of the People's Republic of China clearly 
stipulates, "Women enjoy equal rights with men in all spheres of 
life, political, economic, cultural and social, including family 
life...The state protects the rights and interests of women, 
applies the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and 
women alike and trains and selects cadres from among 
women...Marriage, the family and mother and child are protected 
by the state...Violation of the freedom of marriage is 
prohibited. Maltreatment of old people, women and children is 
prohibited." In line with the principles established by the 
Constitution, New China has promulgated over 10 fundamental 
laws, including the Marriage Law, Electoral Law, Law of 
Inheritance, Civil Law and Criminal Law. The State Council and 
various ministries and commissions under it have enacted over 40 
administrative decrees and regulations. Local governments have 
devised more than 80 local regulations and rules. All these 
legislations include clear provisions on the protection of the 
rights and interests of women. No law in China contains clauses 
that discriminate against women. 
  The Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection 
of the Rights and Interests of Women promulgated in 1992 
provided an effective legal weapon for further enhancing the 
social status of women and guaranteeing their basic rights and 
interests. 
  Under Chinese law, the legitimate rights of women can be 
summed up into the following six aspects: 
  -- Women enjoy equal political rights with men. Women have 
the right, through various channels and in various ways, to 
administer state and social affairs, and enjoy equal rights to 
vote and stand for election. To ensure female participation in 
government and political affairs, the law stipulates that 
deputies to the National People's Congress and local people's 
congresses at various levels should include appropriate numbers 
of women and the proportion should be increased step by step. 
It states that the principle of sexual equality should be 
upheld when appointing people to leading posts, and attention 
should be paid to training and selecting top officials from 
among women. 
  -- Women enjoy equal rights with men with respect to culture 
and education. These cover school admittance, advancement to 
higher levels of schooling, job assignment after graduation, 
conferment of academic degrees and being dispatched for study 
abroad, plus women's rights to engage in scientific and 
technological research and literary and artistic creation. The 
government, society, school and family have the responsibility 
to ensure that the right of female children and adolescents to 
receive compulsory education is observed. 
  -- Women enjoy equal working rights with men. These 
mainly include: the right to work and be employed, equal pay 
for equal work, time-off, on-the-job safety and medical care as 
well as special labor protection, and social insurance. The law 
stipulates that any unit, while recruiting employees, is not 
allowed to refuse to employ women or raise the recruitment 
standards for women under any pretext. It cannot fire women or 
unilaterally annul their labor contracts on the pretext of 
marriage, pregnancy, maternity leave or baby nursing. It is not 
allowed to discriminate against women in terms of promotion, 
award of academic and technical titles, allotment of housing and 
enjoyment of welfare benefits, nor to assign women to tasks that 
are not suitable for them. Women enjoy special protection 
during menstruation, pregnancy, child birth and baby nursing 
period. 
  -- Women enjoy equal property rights with men. The law 
stipulates that rural women enjoy the same rights as rural men 
in the allotment of "responsibility farmland" and "grain-ration 
farmland" and in the approval of housing sites. With regard to 
marriage and family property, women enjoy equal ownership and 
inheritance rights with men. Widows have the right to dispose 
of property they inherit, without interference from anyone. 
  -- Women enjoy equal rights with men relating to their 
persons. Women enjoy the right to life and health, freedom of 
the person, the right of portrait [as received], reputation and 
other rights relating to the person; and they enjoy the right of 
kinship, guardianship, fame and status as a producer. The law 
prohibits abandonment and drowning of female babies and other 
forms of infanticide and bans discrimination against and 
maltreatment of women who give birth to female babies and women 
who are sterile. It forbids tormenting women with superstitious 
and violent means and bans maltreatment or abandonment of aged 
women. It forbids the abduction and kidnapping of women as well 
as the sale and purchase of such women. It bans actions to 
organize, force, seduce, shelter or introduce women to engage in 
prostitution. 
  -- Women enjoy equal rights with men in marriage and the 
family. The law states that women enjoy equal freedom in 
marriage and divorce, and the relations between husband and wife 
are equal. Women can use their own surnames and given names and 
participate in production and social activities. Women are 
subject to special protection with regard to divorce. 
  While clearly delineating the various concrete rights and 
interests of women, China's legislation amplifies the 
responsibilities of state organs in protecting women and 
clarifies the special status and role of the women's federations 
and other women's organizations in lawsuits, thus establishing a 
comprehensive legal mechanism for protecting women. Among the 
54 articles of the Law on the Protection of the Rights and 
Interests of Women, 75 percent list in detail the consequences 
and legal responsibilities for infringements, thus providing an 
operational legal basis for enforcement of the law. 
  At present, China is still at the primary stage of socialism 
and remains comparatively underdeveloped in economic and 
cultural development. Therefore, certain provisions on the 
legal rights of women and guarantee mechanisms need to be 
further improved. Along with the in-depth development of 
China's modernization drive, the country's legal system on the 
protection of women's rights and interests will be perfected. 
  Chapter III -- Equal Rights and Important Role in 
Economic Sphere 
  Improvement of the economic status of women constitutes the 
most important foundation for achieving sexual equality. The 
Chinese government has made fruitful efforts to upgrade and 
enhance the economic status of women. Under new conditions, 
Chinese women have become a great force in the country's social 
development, making major contributions to the socialist 
economic construction. 
  Chinese women enjoy equal rights with men in employment. 
Since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, the 
population of employed women has risen constantly. In China, 
employed females now account for some 44 percent of the total 
number of employees, higher than the world rate of 34.5 percent. 
In 1992, employed females made up 72.33 percent of all women 
over 15, and in the countryside, women laborers made up half the 
rural labor force. The number of urban working women increased 
from 600,000 in 1949 to 56 million, while their share of the 
country's total working population went up from 7.5 percent to 
38 percent. Women's areas of employment cover a wide range. 
Among 12 branches of the national economy, nine employ over 1 
million women. They include industry, agriculture, building, 
transport and communications, commerce, public health, 
education, party and government organs and social organizations. 
There has been a remarkable upgrading of the kinds of jobs they 
are holding. In 1992, the number of women in scientific research 
and comprehensive technological services, party and government 
organs and social organizations, and financial and insurance 
establishments accounted for 34.4 percent, 21.6 percent and 37.3 
percent respectively of all employed in these fields. Despite 
the great progress made in the employment of Chinese women, some 
new problems have cropped up in recent years. For instance, 
women are experiencing difficulty finding jobs, chiefly because 
some units do not want to accept females. The Chinese 
Government is now taking active measures to tackle these 
problems. 
  The principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women 
is basically in place. In China, workers in the same 
industries, doing similar kinds of work and having the same 
technical skills, receive the same pay regardless of sex. 
However, due to current differences in cultural and 
professional competence as well as occupational composition, 
some real income gaps still exist between men and women. 
According to a survey conducted in 1990, the average monthly 
incomes for male and female workers in urban areas were 193.15 
yuan and 149.60 yuan respectively, with women receiving only 
77.4 percent of the pay given to men. In rural areas, the 
average annual incomes for men and women were 1,518 yuan and 
1,235 yuan respectively, with women getting 81.4 percent of the 
earnings of men. However, 1.2 percent of all rural women earned 
an average annual income of over 10,000 yuan, and the percentage 
was the same for men. This indicates that, among those who have 
been the first to prosper in the countryside, the income gap 
between men and women has become insignificant. 
  The Chinese Government provides comprehensive protective 
measures for employed women. According to a survey, 85.3 
percent of child-bearing female workers and staff members in 
urban areas enjoy a three-month paid maternity leave, while some 
units have extended the leave to six months. Female workers 
during their pregnant and lactation period have their work load 
and work time reduced. Most state-owned enterprises where 
women predominate have established gynecological clinics, rest 
rooms for pregnant women, breast-feeding rooms, nurseries and 
kindergartens. 
  As the economic status of Chinese women improves, they are 
playing an increasingly significant role in the economic sphere. 
  The rural economic restructuring, conducted since the end 
of the 1970s, unleashed the immense labor potential of women. 
Women have become an important and indispensable force in 
invigorating and promoting the rural economy. Females account 
for more than half of all workers in agriculture, forestry, 
animal husbandry, fisheries and water conservancy. In major 
cotton-producing areas, the management of cotton fields is 
mostly undertaken by women. Of the 14 million self-employed 
rural individuals engaged in commerce and service trades, women 
account for about one-third. In areas where the commodity 
economy is relatively developed, rural women engaged in business 
account for half of farmers who have gone into trade. About 
50-60 percent of the total rural output value is generated by 
women. 
  Rural women in China are an important driving force for the 
development of township enterprises. At present, rural China 
boasts more than 100 million workers in township businesses, and 
40 million of them are females. The ratio is even greater for 
women working in the food, clothing, knitwear and other woven 
products, toy and electronics industries, as well as traditional 
handicrafts and service trades. They create about 65 percent of 
the output value. Township enterprises producing textiles, silk, 
tea, knitwear and other woven products, embroidery and toys, 
where women make up the bulk of the employees, are the ones 
which earn the most foreign exchange for the country. Quite a 
few women become leaders at different levels in township 
enterprises. For instance, there are 2,000-3,000 women 
directors and managers in such businesses in each of the 
provinces of Jiangsu, Guangdong, Anhui, Fujian and Henan. In 
addition, tens of thousands of women serve as the technical 
backbone in production at workshop and shift level. 
  The great role played by Chinese women in rural economic 
construction has won commendation from some international 
organizations. The rural area of Longkou city, Shandong 
Province, has been selected by the United Nations Development 
Program (UNDP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) 
as an international monitoring point for studying the problem of 
rural women. There rural women not only shoulder 40 to 60 
percent of the workload in the fields but also 74 percent of 
production tasks of township textile, clothing and embroidery 
enterprises. The embroidery articles they make are exported and 
can earn for the country U.S.$2.5 million annually. In recent 
years, 100-odd experts from more than 20 countries have made 
study tours of the area. They have concurred that rural women 
in Longkou are playing as important a role as their male 
counterparts. 
  In the cities, women have made important contributions to 
urban economic reform and development. In the 1982-90 period, 
the growth rate in the number of females employed in the 
following sectors, namely finance, culture and education, radio 
and television, public health, sport and recreation, social 
welfare, commercial concerns, catering, supply and storage, and 
government and social institutions, exceeded that of males by 21 
to 78 percentage points. In 1993, females accounted for 36.8 
percent of those with professional and technical titles in 
enterprises and institutions throughout the country. Women have 
taken an active part in management and offered numerous 
proposals and suggestions for the development of their 
enterprises. According to one survey, women workers and staff 
in Shaanxi, Jiangsu and eight other provinces alone raised 3.87 
million rationalization proposals in the last three years, 
generating 2.1 billion yuan in economic returns. 
  Many women factory directors and enterprise managers have 
come to the fore in the wave of economic reforms and the drive 
to open to the outside world. They have actively participated 
in competition and courageously accepted challenges, playing a 
vital role in ensuring the survival and development of their 
respective enterprises. In 1992, 97 females in the 28 pilot 
enterprises in Liaoning Province, picked to try out reforms, 
rose from rank and file to enterprise managers and leaders in 
the course of fierce competition. In 1988 and 1992, a total of 
107 women factory directors and managers were cited as 
outstanding entrepreneurs. 
  In the 40-odd years since the founding of the People's 
Republic, Chinese women with a sense of self-respect, 
self-confidence, self-reliance and self-strengthening, have 
continued to enhance their own capabilities. Their historic 
accomplishments and significant role in the country's economic 
construction have won widespread commendation. From 1949 to 
1988, a total of 24,858,000 women were awarded the title of 
advanced worker. In the 1978-92 period, 572 outstanding females 
were cited as national model workers, and 20,152 others were 
given the title of "March 8 (International Women's Day) 
Red-Banner Pacesetters." In 1988-93, 936 females were granted 
national "May 1" labor medals. 
  Chapter IV -- Extensive Participation in 
Administration of State and Social Affairs 
  In China, women take full part in administering state and 
social affairs and thus have made mammoth contributions to the 
country's development of democracy and building of its legal 
system. 
  Chinese women occupy an important place in people's 
congresses at various levels. When the First National People's 
Congress (NPC) was held in 1954, there were only 147 women 
deputies, accounting for 12 percent of the total. By 1993, when 
the Eighth NPC was convened, the number of women deputies had 
increased to 626, accounting for 21.03 percent of the total. 
The permanent body of the National People's Congress, the 
Standing Committee, had only four women members, or 5 percent of 
the total, at the time of the First NPC. By the Eighth NPC, the 
number of women Standing Committee members had increased to 19, 
rising to 12.3 percent. From 1954 to 1993, eight women served 
as vice-chairpersons of the NPC Standing Committee. They 
include Soong Ching Ling, He Xiangning, Cai Chang and Chen Muhua. 
  Women deputies to people's congresses at various levels have 
played an important role in legislative work and the 
administration of other state and social affairs. They pay 
particular attention to the problems of education and public 
health, the ecological environment, the protection of the rights 
and interests of women, children and the disabled, social 
security and the general mood of the society. They are active 
in raising suggestions for legislation and policy-making and 
working hard to promote advances in these fields. The enactment 
of the Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of 
Women and many other laws were made on the basis of motions put 
forward by women and with their participation. 
  Chinese women take an active part in the activities of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) at 
various levels. In the Eighth National Committee of the CPPCC 
held in 1993, women accounted for 283 of the members and 29 of 
the standing committee members, making up 13.52 percent and 9.2 
percent of their respective totals. Women members of the CPPCC 
are outstanding figures from all walks of life, and provide wide 
representation. From their different vantage points, they 
express their opinions on national affairs and government work, 
render consultation and carry out democratic supervision. Deng 
Yingchao, Kang Keqing and Qian Zhengying had been or is 
currently among the seven women serving as chairperson or 
vice-chairpersons of the CPPCC National Committee. 
  The system of multi-party cooperation and political 
consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party of 
China forms the basic political system of China. At present, 
the Chinese Communist Party has over 7 million women members, 
accounting for 14 percent of general membership. Many 
outstanding women work in various leading posts within the 
Party. The current 14th CPC Central Committee has 24 women 
members and alternate members, while six women are now acting as 
directors or deputy directors of departments under the CPC 
Central Committee. China's eight democratic parties have some 
110,000 women members. In one party, women constitute 41 
percent of the membership. There are 203 women in the central 
leading organs of the eight democratic parties. Madam Lei 
Jieqiong, vice-chairperson of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee, 
a noted scholar and social activist, is the chairperson of the 
Central Committee of the China Association for Promoting 
Democracy. 
  Participation in government work is an important channel for 
women to play their role in the administration of state and 
social affairs. Since the founding of the People's Republic, 
one woman had served one term as vice-chairperson and later 
honorary president of the country, two women have served as 
vice-premiers of the State Council, and two have been State 
Councilors. China's policies of reform and opening to the 
outside world not only have promoted economic development and 
social progress, but have also prepared better conditions for 
women to participate in government and political affairs. In 
1993, women made up 32.44 percent of all people working in 
government organs. At present, the various ministries and 
commissions under the State Council have 16 female ministers and 
vice-ministers, and the country has 18 female provincial 
governors and deputy governors. In the nation's 517 cities, 
more than 300 women have been elected mayor or deputy mayor. 
  Women play an important role in strengthening legislative 
construction and safeguarding state security. China's judicial 
organs have a large number of women judges, procurators and 
lawyers. In 1992, the country boasted 21,012 female judges and 
4,512 women lawyers. 
  Ordinary women in general also show concern for national 
affairs and government work. There is increasing enthusiasm on 
their part to involve themselves in government and political 
affairs. In all general elections since 1953, when the first 
general election was held for deputies to grass-roots people's 
congresses, over 90 percent of women had exercised their voting 
rights. Since 1984, the rate has risen to 95 percent. Apart 
from frequently making their voices heard through mass 
organizations, women also vent their opinions and raise their 
suggestions on government work and social issues by writing to 
or calling at relevant government offices or through the mass 
media. 
  Women of all ethnic groups and from all walks of life 
realize 
their democratic participation in and supervision over state and 
social affairs through women's federations at various levels. 
This is one of the important channels of women participation in 
political affairs in China. On behalf of women, these 
federations play a part in the making of laws and regulations 
related to the vital interests of women by the people's 
congresses and governments, and supervise their implementation. 
They can propose to relevant government departments that they 
issue policy documents for the settlement of women-related 
problems that emerge. They can also recommend women cadres to 
government organs, social organizations, enterprises and 
institutions. 
  The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Government 
consider the participation of women in government and political 
affairs an important component part of the building of democracy 
in China. They have issued special documents and called meetings 
for improving the external environment for women cadres, so as 
to raise the ratio of women participating in political affairs 
and ensure that women really enjoy the political rights written 
in the Constitution. These documents and meetings deal with the 
work of training and selecting cadres from among women. A whole 
series of regulations have been issued to this effect. At 
present, there are women in the party and government leading 
bodies of 23 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities 
directly under the central government), 244 prefectures (cities, 
autonomous prefectures and leagues) and 2,106 counties 
(districts and banners). In order to promote equality, unity, 
progress and common prosperity among all ethnic groups, the 
government attaches particular attention to training women 
cadres of ethnic minorities, and has established schools for 
these minorities, run training classes for their women cadres 
and offered opportunities for them to go on to advanced studies. 
This has promoted a rapid growth of ethnic minority women 
cadres. By 1992, the number of minority women cadres nationwide 
reached 607,600, accounting for 26.6 percent of all minority 
cadres in the country. Among deputies to the Eighth NPC, 106 
are female deputies from ethnic minorities, accounting for 17 
percent of all women deputies. Moreover, three minority women 
were elected members of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee. 
Cadres from minority nationalities have become a backbone force 
in the political, economic and social development of minority 
areas. 
  The Chinese Government is now working on the program for the 
development of Chinese women, which is aimed at further 
promoting women's participation in government and political 
affairs as well as their overall participation and development. 
  Chapter V -- Full Advance in Society 
  In old China, women were excluded from social life. New 
China has enabled women to make conspicuous progress in all 
aspects of society, especially in the fields of education, 
science and technology, culture, sports and public health. 
  The Chinese Government has exerted great efforts to promote 
women's education. In regular education, the state has adopted 
measures to increase the proportion of female enrollment. In 
some remote, poverty-stricken areas and ethnic minority areas, 
there are free courses and schools specially for women as a 
measure to remove barriers to female education. In 1992, the 
attendance rate for girls from 7 to 11 years old had risen to 
96.2 percent from less than 20 percent before the founding of 
the People's Republic of China in 1949. The proportion of 
females in middle schools, colleges and postgraduate schools 
reached 43.1 percent, 33.7 percent and 24.8 percent 
respectively. Among engineering college graduates, women 
accounted for 27 percent. From 1982, when the academic degree 
system was resumed, to 1993, 1,149 women were awarded 
doctorates, making up 9.4 percent of total Ph.D recipients. 
  The Chinese Government has also paid special attention to 
promoting adult and vocational education and eliminating 
illiteracy among women. There are 1,679 women's secondary 
vocational schools and three women's vocational colleges, which 
offer more than 60 specialties suitable for women. Over 13 
million women are enrolled in institutions of higher learning. 
Over a period of 45 years since the founding of the People's 
Republic, more than 110 million women illiterates have been 
taught to read, reducing the female illiteracy rate from 90 
percent in 1949 to 32 percent in 1993. 
  Chinese women have made active contributions to education. 
In 1992, women teachers at all levels made up 30-44.5 percent 
of teachers nationwide. In Beijing University, the most 
distinguished university of China, about one-third of the 3,000 
academics are female. Among them, 19 are tutors of postgraduate 
candidates, 68 are professors and more than 300 are associate 
professors. Over 20 women across the country assume the posts 
of university president or vice-president. In 1990, 50,000 
teachers were cited for having made outstanding contributions. 
Seventy percent of them were women. In 1993, 5,971 people were 
cited as exemplary teachers and education workers in the 
national education system, among them 1,702 being women, or 28.5 
percent of the total. Of the 592 model workers in the national 
education system, women accounted for 150, or 25.3 percent of 
the total. 
  The Chinese Government has attached great importance to 
training women scientists and technicians, trying to improve 
their working and living conditions and encouraging and 
supporting them in their scientific research. Many women have 
stepped into the frontiers of science and technology in areas 
such as high-energy physics, genetic engineering, 
microelectronics and satellite launching. Together with male 
scientists, they have achieved many breakthroughs. In 1993, 
China had 8,097,000 women scientists and technicians, making up 
35 percent of the total. In the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 
there are 186 women directors of research centers, accounting 
for 11.9 percent of all directors. As to leaders of research 
teams, 514, or 14.8 percent of them are women. In the Chinese 
Academy of Medical Sciences, women make up over 40 percent of 
scientists with senior professional titles, and 47.3 percent of 
the 112 academy-level key research projects are in the charge of 
women. Up to 1993, the Chinese Academy of Sciences had selected 
29 women as academicians, making up 5.4 percent of the total. 
By 1992, 204 women had become state-level experts, accounting 
for 5.7 percent of all such experts in the country. Among 
specialists and scholars who enjoy special government 
allowances, 11,374, or 10 percent of the total, are women. 
Chinese women have become a significant force in scientific and 
technological circles. 
  Chinese women have exhibited their acumen and talents in the 
arts and culture. In 12 cultural organizations, such as the 
Chinese Writers' Association, the China Film Association, the 
Chinese Artists' Association and the China Society for the Study 
of Folk Literature and Art, women members are quite active and 
their proportion hits 41.8 percent at the highest. Women 
writers, performers, painters, directors and musicians are 
constantly emerging. Since China implemented its reform and 
opening up policies, the emergence of a galaxy of writers has 
brightened the literary scene. At international ballet, piano, 
violin and vocal music competitions, women made up over 50 
percent of Chinese prize winners. With acrobats, it is over 70 
percent. 
  The Chinese Government takes active measures to create 
favorable conditions for women participation in physical 
training and international matches. With their enterprising 
spirit, women athletes have done brilliantly in the global 
sports arena. From 1985 to 1993, China had 404 top sportswomen 
at international level, accounting for 51 percent of all Chinese 
athletes at that rank. Between 1949 and 1993, Chinese athletes 
won 775 world championships, of which 460, or 59 percent, were 
won by women; Chinese athletes broke world records 725 times, 
with women accounting for 458 of these, or about 63 percent of 
the total. At the 25th Olympic Games held in 1992, Chinese 
women athletes scooped 12 gold medals, taking three quarters of 
the golds for China. The indomitable and tenacious character 
displayed by Chinese women athletes embody the new look of the 
Chinese nation. 
  Women have made outstanding contributions to the nation's 
medical and health services. By 1993, China had 2.27 million 
medical workers specializing in maternity and child care, 
accounting for 55 percent of all those in the medical 
profession. The late Lin Qiaozhi, who possessed superb medical 
skills and high medical ethics, was vice-president of the 
Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the head of the Society 
of Gynaecology and Obstetrics of the Chinese Medical 
Association. She long engaged in gynaecological and obstetrics 
teaching and research, conducting general surveys and curing 
common and recurring women's illnesses. She contributed 
significantly to China's modern gyniatrics and set an excellent 
example of humanitarianism in healing the wounded and rescuing 
the dying. 
  In the 15 years since the reform and opening up, 382 
achievements in medical sciences have been honored with 
state-level awards. More than 50 percent of these achievements 
were made with the participation of women and a quarter have 
been independently accomplished by females. From 1983 till now, 
15 Chinese women have won the Nightingale Medal, the world's top 
honor for nurses. 
  Women have played an irreplaceable role in enhancing social 
morality, improving social environment and maintaining social 
stability. 
  Neighborhood committees can be found in cities and towns all 
over the country. These are autonomous popular organizations 
and one of their major duties is to mediate in neighborhood 
disputes. Most of the active members are women. With all their 
heart and soul, they perform patient and painstaking work to 
settle disputes among their neighbors. In doing so, they quash 
numerous civil quarrels that might otherwise develop into 
criminal cases and thus promote harmony among residents. 
  Women take the initiative in helping the government in its 
efforts to educate people who have taken a wrong step in life. 
From the very early days after the founding of the People's 
Republic, many public-spirited women visited prisons on their 
days off to see criminals whom they had never met. They wrote 
to felons and encouraged them to rehabilitate themselves during 
their time inside and try to turn over a new leaf. In the last 
few years, more and more women have been participating in this 
type of activity. There are many thousands of "assistance and 
education teams" across the country, mainly composed of women. 
These groups not only help young wrong-doers to remould their 
thinking, but also try to find jobs and spouses for them on 
their release. China is among countries with the lowest 
incidence of crime and recidivism. This fact is closely related 
to the efforts of women. 
  Responding to the government call for a cultured, scientific 
and progressive life style, women show great enthusiasm in 
public welfare work. Most of those who serve in old folks' 
homes and social welfare institutions are women. They treat 
elders and youngsters like their own kith and kin. In numerous 
cities and villages, many women voluntarily take it upon 
themselves to support and care for aged widows and widowers or 
adopt orphans. In cities and towns, retired women take over 
community services on their own initiative. They set up 
nurseries, snack bars, sales commission agencies and hygiene 
supervision posts, which are welcomed by the society. In many 
places, women volunteer to organize associations to ban gambling 
and thus save many families on the verge of disintegration, 
promoting a favorable turn in civil practices and the general 
mood of society. 
  Owing to historical reasons and the constraints of the level 
of social, economic and cultural development, some problems 
continue to impede women's full participation in social life and 
must not be ignored. In particular, the majority of women have 
a low level of education and in some rural areas, especially in 
remote or border regions, female children are not being fully 
guaranteed their right to education. The government and social 
organizations are adopting measures to overcome these 
inadequacies. 
  Chapter VI -- Equal Status in Marriage and Family 
Life 
  The founding of New China put an end to the feudal marital 
and family system that had endured for several millennia. 
Independent marriage based on mutual love and a family life in 
which husband and wife are equal have become the main current in 
contemporary Chinese society. 
  Women have gained the right of self-determination in 
marriage. In old China, over 95 percent of marriages were 
arranged and on a monetary basis. Over the last 40-odd years, 
the degree of freedom in choosing a partner has increased 
significantly. Sample investigations show that 74 percent of 
young couples make the decision themselves to wed or do so after 
consultation with their parents, and 80 percent of marriages of 
women under 40 years old are based on their own choice. Women's 
rights with regard to divorce and remarriage are also duly 
guaranteed. This fact has helped improve the quality of 
marriage and enhance family stability. In addition, it lays an 
emotional foundation for equality between husband and wife in 
the family. 
  Chinese women have gained the important personal right of 
being able to retain their maiden names. In old China, surnames 
symbolized the continuity of a clan. Most women had no formal 
name before marriage. They adopted their husband's surname 
after they wed and children used their father's surname. In New 
China, both husband and wife have equal right to use their own 
names and children do not have to adopt their father's surname 
as was the former custom. In cities, quite a few children take 
their mother's surname. 
  Women's economic independence has promoted their status in 
the family. In old China, family heads were predominantly men. 
In New China, women earn their own income through work. The 
share of women's earnings in total family income has risen from 
20 percent in the 1950s to the present 40 percent. In some 
families, especially rural households which are headed by women 
and which specialize in certain areas of production, the money 
brought in by women makes up as much as 60-70 percent of the 
family total. As they have become economically independent, 
Chinese women have gained more management and decision-making 
power in principal family and economic matters. Sample 
investigations show that in over 58 percent of urban and rural 
families, major affairs are decided by the husband and wife 
together. This figure continues to climb. 
  Women enjoy the same rights of possession and inheritance of 
family property as men. In old China, family assets could only 
be owned and inherited by men. If a widow remarried, she could 
take nothing and a married daughter had no right to inherit 
anything from her parents. Nowadays, in the overwhelming 
majority of families, husband and wife jointly own family 
property and they have equal access to its use and allocation. 
It has become common practice for husband and wife to enjoy the 
same bequeathment rights and for sons and daughters to have 
equal rights as heirs. 
  Historical changes have taken place in family relationship. 
The traditional family characterized by the authority of 
husband and patriarchal system has gradually been replaced by 
the modern family mode, marked by equality and a democratic and 
harmonious atmosphere. In both urban and rural areas, the 
relationships between husband and wife and between 
parents-in-law and daughter-in-law are equal. There is social 
disapproval of ill-treatment meted out to wives and 
daughters-in-law. Women's personal dignity, their rights to 
education and work as well as their ideals and pursuits, are 
generally respected by their husbands and other family members. 
In the past, a wife took on all the housework. Nowadays, in 
most Chinese families, husband and wife share this task 
together. They support each other in their careers and help 
each other in everyday life. In China, such families with close 
emotional ties are emerging in large numbers. 
  China has 267 million families and every year about 10 
million newlywed couples join their ranks. The Chinese 
Government has consistently protected marriage and the family, 
emphasized equality between husband and wife, and fostered the 
Chinese national tradition of respect for the old, love for the 
young and harmonious relations in the family. Currently, the 
divorce rate in China is 1.54 per thousand. Because Chinese 
families are basically stable, family functions, such as living 
arrangements, child rearing and support for the elderly, are 
fully in evidence. Most of the elderly enjoy support and care 
from their children as well as society. 
  The Chinese Government pays much attention to the building 
of 
families and considers family stability and progress to be the 
basis for social stability and progress. Governments at all 
levels list enhancement of family cultural levels in their 
overall planning for local cultural and ideological advance. 
Much effective work has been done in this regard. Associations 
for respect of the elderly and for fostering of morals, and 
wedding and funeral councils have been set up in many places, 
effectively improving the general family and village atmosphere. 
Over the years, campaigns to create civilized and fine families 
and various other related activities have been launched in urban 
and rural areas. They have helped improve the overall 
attributes of family members and promote family democracy and 
harmony, between husband and wife and among all members. 
  The Chinese Government has made significant efforts to 
promote social welfare undertakings and accelerate the 
socialization of housework. The state encourages and supports 
efforts to expand community services. Handy help networks have 
been set up in large numbers, and efforts are made to develop 
branches that are closely related to daily life -- foodstuffs, 
vegetables, commerce, gas and light industrial products. 
Currently, various housework service facilities are surging in 
urban and rural China. There are 450,000 nurseries and 
kindergartens nationwide. The entrance rate to these reaches 70 
percent of pre-school age children in towns and 32 percent in 
the countryside. Convenience foods and electrical household 
appliances are finding their way into families. As a result, 
the average time women spend on housework daily has generally 
decreased. In cities, professional women put an average of 3.75 
hours into household chores. This is almost equivalent to the 
time spent on such tasks by their female counterparts in 
developed countries. 
  Women's rights to decide whether or not to bear children are 
duly protected. In old China, women were just child bearing 
tools, and they were often persecuted by their parents-in-law or 
abandoned by their husbands because they were unable to provide 
any offspring, let alone a son. In New China, women are in 
control of their own child bearing and they can discuss with 
their spouses whether or not they will go through with a 
pregnancy. Historically, Chinese women were victims of early 
marriage and burdened by excessive numbers of offspring. They 
display great enthusiasm for the state's family planning policy 
and the overwhelming majority of them are willing to marry late 
and have children late, and to have fewer children so as to 
guarantee a better quality of life for them. The contraception 
rate among married women reaches 83 percent in the country as a 
whole, and over 90 percent in some places. In 1992, the birth 
rate for the Chinese population was 18.24 per thousand and the 
natural population growth rate was 11.6 per thousand, 
representing respective decreases of 45.4 percent and 55 percent 
over 1970. In the same period, the gross fertility rate fell 
from 5.81 to about 2.0. 
  Maternal health is protected by the state. In old China, 
since there were no maternity and child care centers, countless 
women died from pregnancy complications or other gynaecological 
complaints. New China has devoted much efforts to developing 
health care for women and children. Governments at all levels 
have special functional departments in charge of maternity and 
child hygiene. Health centers in this regard have been set up at 
all levels in both urban and rural areas. By the end of 1992, 
China had 346 maternity and children's health care centers, 
2,841 clinics and 34 pediatric hospitals, initially forming a 
national health network for women and children. At present, 98 
percent of pregnant women in urban areas and 70 percent in rural 
areas can receive prenatal examinations. Modern methods are 
adopted for 84.1 percent of deliveries in China. Compared with 
the early days after the founding of New China, the mortality 
rate for pregnant and lying-in women has dropped from 1,500 per 
hundred thousand to about 94.7 per hundred thousand, and the 
infant mortality rate has fallen from 200 per thousand to 31.42 
per thousand. Some common ailments and frequently-occurring 
diseases that threaten female health have effectively been 
prevented or put under control. Every year close to 40 million 
women receive preventive health checks. In the light of the 
poor hygienic and medical conditions and high incidence of 
disease in ethnic minority areas, the state has attached great 
importance to developing women's health care facilities there. 
Enormous efforts have been put into popularizing modern 
delivery methods, health care for women and children, prevention 
and control of frequently-occurring diseases and elementary 
knowledge of hygiene and sanitation. Much has been done to 
train midwives and gynecological and pediatric medical workers. 
In addition, authorities at all levels often organize mobile 
medical teams to visit farming and pastoral areas and other 
ethnic communities. Free medical care for women is provided in 
Tibet and other regions. 
  Thanks to all these efforts, the average life expectancy of 
Chinese women has risen from 36.7 years in old China to the 
present 72 years. This is three years above the figure for 
Chinese men and seven years higher than the average life 
expectancy of 65 years set as a goal by the United Nations for 
the women of the world by the year 2000. 
  However, in spite of all these achievements, the influence 
of 
feudal concepts and regional imbalances in economic and cultural 
development continues to show their effect. The bad habits of 
arranged and mercenary marriage linger on in some rural areas, 
especially in the outlying and backward spots. Cases of 
drowning and abandonment of female infants and trafficking in 
women occur from time to time. The Chinese Government is paying 
close attention to these problems. It is vigorously advocating 
the equality of the sexes and educating women to use legal 
weapons to defend themselves. Strong measures have been adopted 
against unlawful cruel treatment of women to ensure that their 
legitimate rights and interests are not infringed upon. 
  Chapter VII -- Organizational Guarantees of the 
Rights and Interests of Chinese Women 
  Guarantees for the legal rights and interests of women are 
an 
issue of common concern in China. Government organs, social 
organizations, enterprises and institutions, and rural and urban 
mass groups at the grass roots have all made efforts to this 
effect in line with the laws and regulations. 
  People's congresses at all levels are responsible for 
drafting and revising laws and statutes to protect women's 
rights and interests. They supervise the implementation of 
relevant laws and governmental work to safeguard the position of 
women and children. To ensure the task is performed well, the 
Committee for Internal and Judicial Affairs under the National 
People's Congress (NPC) and the standing committees of 16 
provincial, autonomous, and municipal people's congresses have 
established special departments to handle matters concerning 
women and children. Committees at all echelons of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) carry out 
democratic supervision and provide political consultation on 
legislations concerning women's rights and interests and their 
implementation. They conduct surveys of major problems 
connected with women, and submit their opinions and suggestions 
for resolving them. The National Committee of CPPCC and its 
counterparts in some provinces and municipalities have also 
established committees for women and youth. 
  People's governments at each level and their departments are 
responsible for drafting and revising women-related 
administrative regulations, issuing relevant decisions and 
orders, linking women's advance with social development, and 
adopting administrative measures to oversee the protection of 
women's rights and interests. Judicial bodies at all levels, in 
accordance with legal procedures, hear and judge cases and 
punish criminals who infringe on women's rights and interests 
and see to it that laws are upheld. To coordinate and propel 
governmental departments in their work of guaranteeing the 
rights of women, the State Council has established a Work 
Committee for Women and Children. Its members include leaders 
from 16 ministries and commissions and four mass organizations. 
Similar local government bodies have also been set up in all 
the provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, with the 
exception of Taiwan. 
  More than 5,800 mass women's organizations in China 
undertake 
to report women's views and their problems to the authorities 
and make suggestions on how to solve them. They are an 
important force in safeguarding the status of women. The 
biggest of these is the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF), 
which comprises women from different ethnic groups and all walks 
of life. It has broad representation and a popular basis, and 
furthermore, a sound functional network. Its basic units can be 
found in urban neighborhoods as well as in villages. Aiming to 
represent and defend the interests of women, the federation 
devotes itself to promoting sexual equality and raising women's 
position in society. Its outstanding work has earned it a high 
reputation in society and women's confidence. Many other 
national, regional, and professional women's organizations, such 
as the Council of Women Workers, the Association of Women 
Scientific and Technological Workers, the Young Women's 
Christian Association, and associations of women entrepreneurs, 
women engineers, women journalists, women judges, lawyers, 
writers, calligraphers and so on, are affiliated with the 
federation. As the federation has the same goal as the 
government, which is to unite women to take part in social 
development and to defend women's rights and interests, its work 
is supported and encouraged by the authorities on every rung. 
The eight democratic parties of China have also set up 
commissions for women, whose efforts have effectively defended 
the cause of women. 
  Mass media and research institutes play an important role 
in safeguarding the rights and interests and promoting the 
advancement of women. The press, radio and television publicize 
state laws and regulations upholding women's rights and 
interests and civilized and progressive views on women. This 
has greatly promoted public awareness of women's rights and 
contributions to society. Women's organizations have also 
published many newspapers and magazines for women, the ACWF and 
its branches alone have 47 periodicals. Some newspapers have 
special columns on women. Radio and television stations make 
special women's programs. National and local research 
institutes on women have been established and their activities 
help in many ways to protect women's rights and interests. 
  Coordinating their efforts and acting together, the 
above-mentioned groups have produced positive results in 
eliminating discrimination against women, upholding equality 
between men and women, improving women's qualifications and 
promoting the advancement of women. 
  The Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of 
Women is the product of joint efforts by organs of state power, 
executive bodies and mass groups. The idea of drafting such a 
law was first put forward by the All-China Women's Federation. 
Drafts and proposals to this effect were submitted by deputies 
to the NPC, members of the CPPCC and representatives to the 
Women's Congress. The proposal gained the attention and 
acceptance of the Standing Committee of the NPC, which entrusted 
the drafting work to the ACWF, the Ministry of Civil Affairs and 
the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. The Committee for 
Internal and Judicial Affairs under the National People's 
Congress and the Work Committee for Women and Children under the 
State Council also participated. Since the statute was 
promulgated, these organizations have launched publicity 
activities and extensive surveys to promote its implementation. 
  To stop the abduction and sale of women and children and 
prostitution, phenomena which have reappeared in some areas in 
recent years, the State Council issued a Notice on Reprisals 
Against Trafficking in Women and Children in 1989. In 1991, in 
response to proposals by some political parties and 
organizations, the NPC drew up the Decision on the Strict 
Prohibition Against Prostitution and Whoring and the Decision 
Regarding the Severe Punishment of the Criminals Who Abduct and 
Traffic in or Kidnap Women or Children. Government departments 
involved held three successive work meetings, and as a result, 
social security was enhanced and felonies checked. In 1992, 
there was a 35.2 percent reduction in cases of abduction and 
sale of women and children as compared with 1991, and there was 
a further drop of 9 percent in 1993. 
  Female self-improvement is a strategic task fundamental to 
the protection of women's rights and interests. Since 1989, the 
All-China Women's Federation, together with over 10 governmental 
departments, has launched several campaigns for the betterment 
of women themselves. One aimed at promoting cultural and 
technical studies and achievements among women of different 
ethnic groups in the countryside. By the end of 1993, more than 
120 million rural women had joined in and 90 million of them had 
received practical technical training. Another 10 million had 
learned to read and write, while 510,000 gained the title of 
agro-technician. In poverty-stricken areas, mostly old 
revolutionary bases, ethnic minority areas and border regions, 
250 training classes have been held and 4,500 aid stations have 
been set up to help the impoverished. Nowadays, 80 percent of 
the poor families covered by these stations have adequate food 
and clothing. About 37.76 million urban women took part in an 
ACWF-initiated project to contribute to the Eighth Five-Year 
Plan, and 4,672 of them were dubbed pacesetters, and another 
15,132 were awarded at provincial level or above the title of 
"Able Woman." The above-mentioned project embraced a call for 
women to have high ideals, high moral standards, education and 
discipline (briefly known as "four haves") as well as to strive 
for self-respect, self-confidence, self-reliance and 
self-strengthening (briefly known as "four selfs"). The slogan 
of "four selfs" was first raised at the Sixth National Congress 
of Women. Then, the Seventh National Congress of Women adopted a 
10-Point Goal for the Advancement of Chinese Women in the 1990s. 
The "four selfs" slogan and the 10-point goal produced a 
widespread impact upon women and society. Inspired by them, 
millions of Chinese women are realizing their own betterment and 
progress in the course of propelling society forward. 
  Chapter VIII -- Active Participation in 
International Women's Activities 
  China recognizes and respects the principle of sexual 
equality affirmed in the United Nations Charter and appreciates 
and supports UN endeavors to promote the status of women and 
realize sexual equality. China has taken an active part in 
international women's activities sponsored by the UN. In 
accordance with its independent foreign policy of peace, China 
is striving to develop friendly exchanges and cooperation with 
women from all over the world, while making unremitting efforts 
to realize the goal of worldwide equality between men and women, 
women's participation in social development and maintenance of 
world peace. 
  Since resuming membership in the UN in October 1971, China 
has shown great enthusiasm in participating in UN activities 
related to women. 
  China has been playing an active role in UN women's 
organizations. Since 1974, China has been elected five times as 
a member state in the UN Commission on the Status of Women. 
There, Chinese representatives have expounded Chinese women's 
stand on world peace, participation in development and promotion 
of sexual equality, exchanged experience and information on 
promoting women's conditions and giving full play to the role of 
women with their counterparts from other countries. This has 
helped to enhance mutual understanding and develop friendly 
cooperation. Since 1982, Chinese experts have been elected four 
times in succession as representatives on the Committee on 
Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and participated in 
evaluating the reports submitted by governments and made 
strenuous efforts to eliminate discrimination against women. 
From 1985 to 1988, China was elected a member of the board of 
directors of the International Research and Training Institute 
for the Advancement of Women, where it made positive 
contributions to women's research and training. 
  China was one of the first signatories to the Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and 
has submitted timely reports on its implementation in China as 
required. China took part in formulating and examining the 
Nairobi Forward-Looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women 
to the Year 2000, and has laid down statutes and adopted 
concrete policies in accordance with China's reality so that the 
Nairobi Strategies may be realized. China has consistently 
carried out the principle that men and women enjoy equal pay for 
equal work. In 1990, it formally ratified the Convention 
Concerning Equal Remuneration for Men and Women Workers for Work 
of Equal Value released by the International Labor Organization. 
  China supported and engaged in activities for International 
Women's Year in 1975 and the UN Decade for Women, from 1975 to 
1985. The Chinese Government sent delegations to the world 
conferences on women held in Mexico City in 1975, Copenhagen in 
1980 and Nairobi in 1985, and also to the five global 
preliminary meetings and two regional preparatory meetings. At 
these events, Chinese representatives gave full support to 
exertions for the United Nations Decade for Women and expounded 
China's stand and viewpoints on some major international 
problems and strategies for the advancement of conditions for 
women, thus making positive contributions to the success of 
these conferences. At the same time, Chinese women's 
organizations sent members to take part in Non-Governmental 
Organization Forum held during the three conferences. China 
attended 17 UN-sponsored training classes and seminars aimed at 
realizing the goals of the UN Decade for Women. In the course of 
these efforts, China exchanged observations and improved its 
relations with other countries. 
  Chinese women have made vigorous efforts to develop links 
with women organizations and individuals around the globe. To 
date, the All-China Women's Federation has established ties with 
nearly 480 governmental and non-governmental women's and 
children's organizations in over 130 countries and regions and 
received more than 10,000 visitors in recent years, including 
first ladies, women ministers, members of parliament, 
entrepreneurs, specialists, scholars and leaders and staff 
members of women's and children's groups. In the past 15 years, 
China has sent 280 women delegations abroad. Indeed, Chinese 
women have friends all over the world. 
  China believes that although different countries have 
different histories and their realities and level of economic 
development vary, they face some common tasks, similar situation 
and difficulties with regard to women. China is ready to 
establish relations with women of all states to learn from each 
other so as to jointly improve the situation for women. In 
recent years, Chinese women's organizations have jointly 
sponsored seminars with their counterparts in the United States, 
Russia, Japan and other countries to study and exchange views on 
issues that confront women worldwide. 
  China has taken an active part in international cooperative 
projects concerning women. At the request of UNESCO, the 
Asia-Pacific Development Center and United Nations University, 
China has undertaken research projects on Chinese women and 
submitted many reports which have all been well received. Over 
the past decade, the All-China Women's Federation has cooperated 
with the United Nations Children's Fund, United Nations Women's 
Development Fund, United Nations University, Canadian 
International Development Agency and other governmental and 
non-governmental organizations in over 700 projects in 30 
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. The schemes 
include such items as eliminating illiteracy among rural women 
and providing them with practical technical training, offering 
vocational training for job-seeking young urban women, training 
kindergarten teachers, and promoting women's and children's 
health care and family education. Over 300,000 women have taken 
part in these programs and the results have been outstanding. 
The Assistance for Youth Employment Project has been awarded a 
special prize by the United Nations Women's Development Fund, 
and the All-China Women's Federation has been highly commended 
as an ideal partner for international cooperation. 
  Support has flowed from China for efforts by developing 
countries to foster women's participation in economic 
development. Since 1980, China has provided 101 batches of 
material assistance to women's and children's organizations in 
50 countries. The provisions included sewing and embroidery 
machines, cultural and sports facilities, and clothes and toys. 
They have helped vocational training for unemployed urban young 
women and promoted women's work. To meet the needs of these 
countries, China has in recent years dispatched technical groups 
specializing in straw, flax and corn straw weaving and 
embroidery to Mozambique, Mexico, Mauritius, Uganda and Ecuador 
to help raise the production skills of local women. These 
contributions have received high praise from the local 
governments and people. 
  China adheres to the United Nations theme of equality, 
development and peace when taking part in international 
bilateral and multilateral women's activities. 
  In upholding the principle of equality between men and 
women, 
China believes this concept concerns not only the interests of 
women but also the full employment of the wisdom of humanity and 
total utilization of social productive forces. Equality is a 
prerequisite for women's participation in social development. 
In March 1985, at the third preliminary session on reviewing 
the achievements of the UN Decade for Women, the Chinese 
delegate pointed out, "Equality between men and women has been 
the goal of the women's movement for a long time. The United 
Nations Decade for Women has scored marked progress in 
legislative equality, but this is not enough... We believe that 
strategically we must stress that efforts must be made at the 
international, regional and national levels to work out active 
plans in order to reach a genuine equality; every governmental 
and non-governmental organization should provide legal services 
for women and make it possible for them to adopt legal weapons 
to protect their legitimate rights." At present, political, 
economic, social, family and racial discrimination against women 
continue to exist in some countries to varying degrees. Hence, 
a significant narrowing of the gap between law and reality 
remains an important and arduous task for every government and 
the international community at large. 
  China is convinced that the key to achieving sexual equality 
is to enable women to take part in development as the equals of 
men. Women provide great momentum for human progress, and 
without their participation, true progress is not possible. 
Nowadays, many obstacles still prevent women from fully taking 
part in social development. In addition to formulating laws and 
regulations to ensure the right to equal participation, it is 
necessary to strengthen women's education so that women's 
talents are developed and their scientific and cultural 
standards and management skills can be enhanced. For historical 
reasons and as a result of an unfair and irrational global 
economic order, most of the developing countries suffer from a 
low level of economic development and backwardness in science 
and technology. This has seriously hindered women's 
participation in social and economic development, hence their 
low social status. For this reason, the international economic 
order should be thoroughly transformed. Bilateral and 
multilateral economic and technical cooperation should be 
developed so that women worldwide, and especially those from 
developing countries, can enjoy the right to participate in 
social development as men's equals. 
  China believes that women are a great force in maintaining 
world peace, and this is closely linked to the future of our 
planet and the destiny of the mankind, women in particular. 
Without peace, development and sexual equality are out of the 
question. However, in today's world, acts which go against the 
United Nations Charter and the principles of international law 
still exist. These include such practices as the big bullying 
the small, the strong domineering over the weak, interfering in 
the internal affairs of other countries and violating their 
sovereignty, and armed aggression and occupation of the 
territory of other states. Local wars and regional conflicts 
have been incessant. China firmly supports the struggle by 
women and the entire humanity against external aggression and 
interference and the efforts to safeguard national independence, 
promote national economies and women's advancement. China 
believes that all countries, big or small, strong or weak, rich 
or poor, are equal. Countries should abide by the Five 
Principles of Peaceful Co-existence. The internal affairs of a 
state should be solved by its own people, while international 
matters should be settled through consultation among countries. 
Over the years, Chinese women have made unremitting efforts to 
maintain world peace, and to fight against imperialism, old and 
new colonialism, hegemonism, racism of various forms, fascism 
and all forms of terrorism. 
  As the host country of the Fourth World Conference on Women, 
China will make positive efforts to ensure its success. Since 
the United Nations accepted the application of the Chinese 
Government and decided to hold the Fourth World Conference on 
Women in Beijing in September 1995, the Chinese Government has 
attached great importance to its preparatory work. In August 
1992, the State Council set up an Organization Committee 
consisting of leaders from 30 relevant ministries, the Beijing 
municipal government and mass groups to be fully responsible for 
the preparation. Chaired by State Councillor Peng Peiyun, the 
committee stresses that the preparation for the conference 
should also be used as an opportunity to promote the role of 
Chinese women in social development and sexual equality. In 
March 1993, Chinese Premier Li Peng stressed in the Report on 
Government Work at the First Session of the Eighth National 
People's Congress, "We should make the Fourth World Conference 
on Women a success." This is a call to the Chinese people for 
general mobilization and also a solemn pledge to the 
international community. At present, the Chinese Government is 
earnestly carrying out its responsibilities as a host country 
and increasing its contacts and cooperation with UN 
organizations, governments and relevant non-governmental 
organizations in the world. It is exerting its utmost efforts 
to facilitate the convocation of the conference and contribute 
to the global advancement of women.

<F P=106> ["Comments on U.S. State Department Human Rights Report on </F>
China by the China Society for Human Rights Studies (June 1994)" 
-- XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Beijing, June 8 (XINHUA) -- Following is the full 
text of the comments on the U.S. State Department human rights 
report on China by the China Society for Human Rights Studies: 
  On February 1 of this year, the U.S. Department of State 
released its human rights report for 1993. The 1,600-page 
report contains judgements and criticisms of the human rights 
situation in 193 countries and regions throughout the world. 
This society obtained the country report on China (English 
version) from the U.S. Embassy in China. The report criticized 
what it calls "widespread and well-documented human rights 
abuses" in China, and claims that "the government's overall 
human rights record in 1993 fell far short of internationally 
accepted norms." As a non-governmental academic society 
dedicated to study human rights, we are bound to seriously 
consider such grave accusations. The society has studied 
repeatedly the report and, at the same time, has checked and 
conducted investigations related to cases mentioned for three 
months. We discovered the report is not serious, unfair and 
lacks objectivity and is fundamentally based on rumors and 
subjective conjecture. We are indeed surprised that a report of 
this nature was released in the name of the U.S. Department of 
State. 
<H5>  Dual Criteria </H5>
  This human rights report of the U.S. State Department once 
again demonstrates that the U.S. Government uses dual criteria 
on the issue of human rights. The following are a few examples: 
  1. The report devotes extensive space to attacks on China's 
arrest and imprisonment of counter-revolutionary criminals. 
According to China's criminal law, counter-revolutionary crimes 
actually refer to any acts which endanger the security of the 
state. In the world today, every sovereign state enacts strict 
laws to deal with criminal activities that endanger the security 
of the state and society. For example, in the United States, 
the U.S. Code explicitly prohibits rebellion, revolt, rioting, 
instigating riots or advocating the overthrow of the government. 
Article 2383 of the Code, under the heading "rebellion or 
insurrection", stipulates, "whoever incites, sets on foot, 
assists or engages in any rebellion or insurrection against the 
authority of the U.S. or the laws thereof, or gives aid or 
comfort thereof shall be fined not more than U.S. dollars 10,000 
or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both; and shall be 
incapable of holding any office under the U.S." Article 2385 
stipulates, "whoever knowingly or willfully advocates, abets, 
advises...overthrowing or destroying the Government of the 
United States shall be imprisoned not more than 20 years." 
Since the United States enacts strict controls and punishment 
of anti-government activities, what right does the U.S. State 
Department human rights report have to charge China with 
punishing criminals who endanger the security of the state? 
  The report accuses China of indiscriminately and wantonly 
arresting and maltreating criminals. However, statistics 
indicate that in 1993 the proportion of imprisoned criminals 
accounted for only 103/100,000ths of China's total population, 
while that in the United States was 455/100,000ths. China 
regards its prisons as schools for reforming criminals, and the 
current recidivism rate in China is a low 6-8 percent, while 
that in the United States exceeds 40 percent. China has long 
before joined the convention against torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment adopted by the 
United Nations general assembly in 1984, while the United States 
has so far refrained from doing so. 
  2. The report criticizes China by alleging that "most 
women employed by industry work in low skill and low paid jobs. 
Women hold relatively few positions of significant influence 
within the party or government structure," charging China with 
discrimination against women. It should be noted that achieving 
the goal of full equality between men and women still requires 
tremendous efforts by various countries around the world. In 
this regard, China, too, still has many shortcomings. But a 
comparison between China and the United States reveals that the 
Chinese women enjoy far better status and rights than the 
American women do. The United States has not as yet joined the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
Against Women adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 
1979, while China has already joined it. It was not until 1920, 
or 144 years after the founding of the United States, that 
American women legally gained the right to vote. However, 
immediately after the founding of the People's Republic of 
China, the government issued a proclamation stipulating that men 
and women enjoy equal status, and women and men alike have the 
right to vote and stand for election. 
  Between 1990 and 1993, the proportion of women deputies to 
people's congresses at various levels in China exceeded 20 
percent, while in the United States, the proportion of women 
members at legislatures of various levels in 1992, which was 
called the "year of congress women," was only 18.4 percent. 
According to a recent survey, in terms of urban workers and 
staff members, the average income for women employees was 77.5 
percent that of their male colleagues, while the income of rural 
women was 81.4 percent that of men. However, a sharp contrast 
exists with figures from the United States where women earn only 
51 percent of the wages paid to their male counterparts. In 
1992, the proportion of Chinese women studying in China's 
universities and as post-graduate accounted for 33.9 percent and 
24.8 percent of the total respectively, while the total number 
of female graduates majoring in engineering stood at 27 percent, 
a figure much higher than the 15 percent for American women. In 
1993, China had nearly 8.1 million women scientists and 
technicians involved in science and technology, accounting for 
35 percent of China's total number of technicians, much higher 
than the 12.2 percent in the United States for the same period. 
  3. The report describes China as a country where the life 
and safety of the people cannot be guaranteed. Obviously, this 
is not true. The Chinese people's living standards have 
continued to improve and their lives are fully guaranteed; 
whereas in the United States, the richest country in the world, 
the lives and safety of many people are being threatened. On 
January 20 this year, the eastern part of the United States was 
hit by a severe blizzard, with temperatures dropping to -20 
degrees centigrade. According to an associated press report on 
January 21, more than 130 people in Washington D.C. alone, froze 
to death while in a developing country like China a similar case 
was completely different. A recent survey shows that not a 
single person in Beijing, a city with a population of 10 
million, froze to death this year, a case which has held true 
for a number of years. It was exceptionally cold this year in 
Harbin, a city with a population of several millions, and the 
temperature on January 5 fell to -34.5 degrees centigrade. 
Nonetheless, not a single person was reported to have died from 
freezing throughout the entire rough winter. 
  The tragedy involving the freezing to death of more than 130 
people in the capital of the United States occurred on January 
21 this year. Ten days later, the U.S. State Department 
published the "human rights report," criticizing and censuring 
China and many other countries for their human rights 
situations. This is an irony of the first magnitude. 
  Self-Contradictory and Fabricating Charges 
  The report pretends to be fair, while at the same time 
making 
unwarranted charges against the status of China's human rights, 
thereby revealing its numerous contradictions, unjustness and 
attempt to fabricate charges. For example: 
  1. The report admits that China has inflicted "severe 
punishment" on officials involved in extra-judicial injuries and 
killings. Some officials received death sentences or long 
prison terms. However, the report, based on the story that a 
Shanxi farmer who was beaten by public security officials "died 
as a result of his injuries and a lack of timely medical care", 
concludes that the Chinese Government "failed to control the 
abuses by its own security forces". 
  2. The report accuses China for torturing prisoners which, 
it claims, is a result of the weaknesses in China's legal 
system, "including the emphasis on obtaining confessions as a 
basis for convictions". The report, however, also says that 
"according to (Chinese) judicial officials, confessions without 
corroborating evidence are an insufficient basis for 
conviction", and that official media and other reports indicate 
that "coerced confessions have led to erroneous convictions". 
The report says according to a Chinese report to the United 
Nations, of the 339 cases related to extorting confessions and 
torture which occurred in 1992, 209 cases were prosecuted by the 
procuratorate. In 1993, the chief of procurator of the Supreme 
People's Procuratorate announced that inspection units 
comprising 2,800 inspectors would be set up in various prisons 
and houses of detention to supervise and prevent the 
mistreatment of prisoners. While admitting the aforementioned 
fact, the report, nonetherless, reached a groundless conclusion 
that "the number of actual incidents of torture and 
ill-treatment by government officials is almost certainly far 
greater than this number". 
  3. The report asserts that many Chinese scholars "have 
declined opportunities to publish or present papers on subjects 
which they fear could be construed as sensitive". Almost 
immediately, however, it admits, "on some less sensitive, but 
still controversial subjects, such as economic policy, legal 
reform and even civil rights issues, the government has 
tolerated more vigorous public discussion." This particular 
statement is quite difficult to understand. A well-known fact 
is that economic policy, legal reform and civil rights issues 
are the major topics of public concern in China. If the report 
considers these areas less than sensitive, what then does it 
mean by sensitive issues? 
  4. The report blames China for not respecting the political 
rights of the people, saying that Chinese citizens "cannot 
freely choose or change the law or the officals who govern 
them". However, it admits in another paragraph that in some 
county- and provincial-level people's congress elections in 
1993, "the candidates most favored by authorities were defeated". 
  5. The report states, "a sharp reported drop in the 
fertility rate in 1991-92 sparked concern about a possible 
upturn in incidents of coercion." Nonetheless, it immediately 
adds, "there was strong evidence that the magnitude of the 
reported fertility drop was sharply exaggerated." Which of the 
two aforementioned statements should people accept as reliable? 
  6. The report says that "the number of Christians in China 
has grown rapidly in recent years," while at the same time 
claiming that freedom of religion is restricted in the country. 
When referring to the ethnic minority issue, the report says 
that "minorities benefit from an official policy of 'privileged 
treatment' in marriage policy, family planning, university 
admissions, and employment, as well as from disproportionate 
infrastructure investment in some minority areas." It makes 
these statements immediately after alleging that "in practice 
discrimination based on ethnicity...has persisted." 
  Furthermore, in certain sections, the report is evidently 
playing with words in an attempt to fabricate charges against 
China. For example, the report says, "no executions for 
political offenses are known to have occurred in 1993." 
Therefore, lacking an excuse, the report purposely turns simple 
facts into mysteries by suggesting that some so-called political 
dissidents might in fact have been executed. 
  The report blames Chinese judicial authorities' relevant 
regulations of 1990 requiring all organizations to be officially 
registered and approved, which, it adds, "deter the formation of 
unauthorized political or labor organizations." This seems to 
suggest that the U.S. Department of State fails to think it is 
right for Chinese judicial organs to act according to law. 
<H5>  Groundless Criticisms Against China </H5>
  As a government report, it should present accurate and solid 
facts. This is a minimum requirement. After reading the U.S. 
report, we discovered that many conclusions lack factual 
backing, and many labels lack substance. The sources of the 
so-called facts used in the report are unclear, as shown in 
phrases such as "according to a credible report," "credibly 
reported," "credible reports indicate," "some reports said," 
"there was limited evidence," "according to report," and 
"according to reliable sources." These ambiguous formulations 
can be found throughout the report, and individuals and items 
specifically mentioned in the report failed to tally with the 
facts discovered during our investigation. 
  1. The U.S. human rights report conspicuously discusses the 
mistreatment of Liu Gang, saying that "credible reports 
persisted in 1993 saying that Liu Gang, a political prisoner 
held in a Liaoning prison is in ill health as a result of 
beatings and other mistreatment." 
  Our on-the-spot investigations and discussions with the 
Labor 
Reform Bureau under the Chinese Ministry of Justice revealed 
that Liu Gang, formerly a temporary worker with the Beijing 
Wear-Resistant Materials Development Co., was sentenced to six 
years of imprisonment with deprivation of political rights for 
two additional years after being convicted of attempting to 
subvert the government in June 1989. He is serving out his 
sentence in the Lingyuan No. 2 prison in Liaoning Province. 
During the 49th meeting of the United Nations Commission on 
Human Rights, held on March 3, 1993, the U.S. representative 
criticized China, saying that "according to a report, during a 
1992 hunger strike to protest conditions in the prison, prison 
officials force-fed the prisoner (Liu Gang) and broke his arm." 
Chinese representative Zhang Yishan immediately refuted the 
rumor that "Liu Gang's arm was broken." In his statement, Zhang 
pointed out that Liu Gang had never been mistreated and shown as 
evidence a recent photo published in the Hong Kong monthly 
BAUHINIA showing Liu playing volleyball. The U.S. 
representative failed to respond to the evidence presented. 
  This year's human rights report of the U.S. Department of 
State once again advanced this rumor which was previously 
disproved. In late February of this year with special approval 
of the Ministry of Justice, a member of the society made a 
special trip to the prison to conduct an on-the-spot 
investigation of Liu Gang's situation, and while there met 
personally with Liu who appeared quite healthy. Liu lives on 
the fifth floor of the five-story prison building. Each floor 
has two cell blocks, and except for an iron bar door and a 
guard, the cell blocks are open. Each floor has a recreational 
room with a TV set, newspapers, magazines, and games such 
Chinese chess and playing cards. Liu lives in a 25-square-meter 
sun-filled room along with three other prisoners. He only 
cleans his own room without participating in any other labor and 
eats prison food just as other prisoners. He receives prompt 
medical attention for any reported illness. Our member checked 
Liu's medical records and physical examination papers kept in 
the prison hospital. In these years, his only illnesses have 
been common colds. The physical examination records show that 
Liu is in very good health. With a height of 1.66 meters, Liu 
weighed 65 kg when entering prison, but now weighs 69 kg. He 
often plays volleyball, table-tennis and bridge. 
  2. The report also mentions Wang Juntao, Chen Ziming and Ren 
Wanding, who were imprisoned for various crimes. The report 
says that when ill the men "have difficulties in obtaining 
timely and adequate medical treatment." However, investigations 
by this society showed that Wang Juntao suffered from hepatitis 
prior to being sent to jail. Doctors at the prison hospital and 
the central hospital under the Labor Reform Bureau in Beijing 
have conducted physical examinations and prescribed treatment 
for Wang on numerous occasions. They have also consulted with 
experts from other hospitals. Wang Juntao was hospitalized in 
the prison hospital for 19 months. In June 1993, he was sent to 
the nation's authoritative hepatitis hospital for treatment. He 
lived alone in a ward with a toilet. The prison administration 
has paid a huge sum of money for his hospitalization, 
examinations and medical treatment. In consideration of 
humanitarianism, a short time ago Wang Juntao was released on 
bail for medical treatment by the Chinese judicial department 
and then allowed to have medical treatment abroad. Since going 
abroad, Wang has participated in activities in the United States 
and Europe. Facts prove that he is in good health. Chen Ziming 
received good medical treatment while in prison. Recently, he 
was also released on bail for medical treatment by the Chinese 
judicial department. 
  Ren Wanding is in good health, and the allegation that he 
had 
problems in obtaining treatment is out of the question. During 
the 1992 and 1993 spring festivals, with the approval of the 
prison authorities, Ren Wanding was reunited with his family. 
In March this year, CCTV videos showed that he is in good 
health. 
  3. The report says that Yulo Dawa Tsering, Ngawang Puchung, 
Jempel Tsering, Gendun Richen and Lobsang Yonten were arrested 
because they organized a "peaceful assembly" in Tibet. A 
well-reported fact is that these people were tried by the 
Chinese judiciary because they were engaged in criminal 
activities that violated China's criminal law. Related Chinese 
authorities have on several occasions presented in-depth 
accounts of the situation of these people to the UN human rights 
bodies and human rights organizations in some countries. This 
society has once again conducted a thorough verification. 
  1) Yulo Dawa Tsering. Yulo was sentenced to imprisonment 
for life for his participation in the 1959 armed rebellion 
designed to split the country. In 1979, he was granted amnesty 
and released. In 1987, Yulo once again incited "independence of 
Tibet" and engaged in criminal activities aimed at splitting 
China. In accordance with the criminal law of the People's 
Republic of China, Yulo was sentenced to 10 years of 
imprisonment in January 1989 by the Lhasa Intermediate People's 
Court of the Tibet Autonomous Region with deprivation of 
political rights for three additional years. 
  In November 1990, diplomatic envoys from some Nordic 
countries met with Yulo Dawa Tsering during their visit to the 
Lhasa prison. Following their visit, the ambassadors admitted 
that foreign reports related to the case were unfounded. In 
October 1992, a U.S. human rights delegation met with Yulo Dawa 
Tsering during their visit to the Lhasa prison. At present, 
Yulo is serving out his sentence in Lhasa, and he is in good 
health. 
  2) Ngawang Pulchung. Beginning in August 1988, he drafted 
and printed leaflets inciting the public to overthrow the 
government. In January 1989, he founded and led an illegal 
organization with the objective of splitting China. Acting in 
compliance with the directives of anti-China forces abroad, he 
engaged in espionage and gathered state secrets. In March 1989, 
he participated in the Lhasa riots. His acts seriously 
endangered the security of the country and violated China's 
criminal law. On November 30, 1989, the Intermediate People's 
Court of Lhasa city of the Tibet Autonomous Region tried and 
convicted him according to law and, in accordance with the 
stipulations of the criminal law of the People's Republic of 
China, sentenced him to 19 years of imprisonment, with 
deprivation of political rights for five additional years. 
  3) Jampel Tsering. Jampel joined with Ngawang Pulchung and 
others to establish the illegal organization which was engaged 
in activities aimed at splitting China. He also engaged in 
espionage, supplied materials to intelligence agencies abroad 
and attempted to illegally cross the border. The Intermediate 
People's Court of Lhasa city of the Tibet Autonomous Region 
tried and convicted him according to law and sentenced him to 
five years of imprisonment in accordance with the stipulations 
of the criminal law of the People's Republic of China. 
  4) Genden Richen and Lobsang Yonten. Because the two men 
spied out state secrets which endangered the security of the 
country, they were detained and investigated according to law by 
the Public Security Department of the Tibet Autonomous Region in 
May 1993, and were later released. 
  4. The report asserts that China has "no legislation to 
ensure that buildings, even new buildings, are accessible to the 
handicapped." 
  In September 1985, in order to create an obstacle-free 
environment for the disabled, the Ministry of Construction, the 
Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Chinese Association for 
Handicapped, referring to international standards and acting in 
accordance with China's actual conditions, drafted and 
promulgated the standards for the design of urban roads and 
structures facilitating the use of people with disabilities. 
The law of the People's Republic of China on guaranteeing 
security for people with disabilities adopted in 1990 clearly 
stipulates, "the state and society will gradually put into 
practice the standard for the design of urban roads and 
structures facilitating people with disabilities and will 
introduce obstacle-free measures." The statement in the report 
indicates that officials of the U.S. Department of State reached 
irresponsible conclusions without referring to China's laws. 
  5. The report says, "unemployed (Chinese) workers are not 
considered to be union members." This is not the case. Article 
7 of the Constitution of the All-China Federation of Trade 
Unions clearly stipulates, "members who have retired or have 
been made redundant can retain their membership status and are 
exempt from membership fees." Chinese trade union organizations 
are not only concerned about the lives of their unemployed 
members, but also actively forward their demands and wishes to 
relevant authorities. 
  6. The report says, "accused persons are given virtually no 
opportunity to prepare a defense in the pretrial 
process...Defense lawyers may be retained only seven days before 
the trial." It also alleges, "under Chinese law, there is no 
requirement for the court to appoint a defense attorney for the 
defendant." The actual fact is that according to article 110 of 
China's criminal procedure law, the people's court, acting on 
the decision of a hearing, shall "serve the accused with a copy 
of the charge sheet of the people's procuratorate not less than 
seven days prior to the opening of the court session, and shall 
inform the accused that he may retain an advocate, or, where 
necessary, designate an advocate on his behalf." If the advocate 
finds the time is insufficient, he may apply for a postponement 
of the opening of the court session. The court will seriously 
consider and adopt the advocate's opinion as it deems necessary, 
as long as the application is submitted within the legal time 
limit for the hearing. Article 27 of the criminal procedure law 
stipulates, "...The people's court shall assign an advocate for 
the accused if he fails to retain one on his own...In cases 
where an accused is deaf or dumb, or a minor, the people's court 
shall assign an advocate for him if he fails to retain one on 
his own." The report distorts the stipulation that "seven days 
prior to the opening of the court session," saying instead 
"seven days before the trial," and altering "the people's court 
shall assign an advocate for the accused" to read "there is no 
requirement that the court appoint a defense attorney for the 
defendant." Was this simply a mistake resulting from the 
failure of U.S. officials to refer to China's law, or did they 
deliberately misrepresent China's law in order to deceive the 
public? 
<H5>  Arbitrary Attacks on China's Human Rights Situation </H5>
  To scientifically assess the human rights situation of a 
country, one should not focus totally on individual events or a 
few persons, while neglecting the overwhelming majority of the 
population. Assessments should not be confined to single matters 
at a given time, but rather should be an overall assessment from 
an objective, historical and developmental perspective. At 
present, there is not a single country in the world which can 
say that its human rights situation is perfect. The most 
important thing is to view a country's overall human rights 
situation, its historical background and future trend. China's 
human rights situation should be approached in this manner. 
However, the U.S. State Department's report makes a sweeping 
assessment of China by seizing on individual, minor and 
transient problems. As one Chinese saying puts it: seize upon 
one point and ignore the overall picture. A fair appraisal 
reveals that since the founding of the People's Republic of 
China in 1949, the Chinese people have completely rid themselves 
of the previous situation in which they were bullied and 
trampled upon by others, and were deprived of human rights. 
They, instead, have become the masters of their own country. 
Over the past 40-plus years since the founding of New China, 
and especially during the past decade or so, China's near 1.2 
billion people have basically solved problems related to 
adequate food and clothing, and are well on the way to a 
relatively comfortable life, with living standards improving 
with each passing day. A situation of political stability, 
economic development and people living and working in peace and 
contentment has emerged in the country. In 1993, China 
witnessed vigorous economic development and its gross domestic 
product (GDP) exceeded 3,000 billion yuan, with the urban 
residents' per-capita income increasing by 10.2 percent over the 
1992 figure. The Chinese people also made significant 
improvements in terms of human rights, and are now advancing 
toward higher objectives. China has devoted great efforts to 
strengthening socialist democratic politics and legislative 
construction. Since 1979, it has promulgated and implemented 
numerous basic laws, including the constitution, the criminal 
law, the criminal procedure law, the general principle of civil 
law, the civil procedure law and the administrative procedure 
law. More than 1,000 laws related to human rights have been 
enacted by the central and provincial governments. Law 
enforcement institutions act strictly according to law. 
Supervisory and procuratorial institutions promptly correct the 
errors made by individual personnel while enforcing law. Mass 
organizatrions (non-governmental organizations) exercise 
supervision, the people have various channels for appeal, and 
news media plays a supervisory role...It is widely acknowledged 
that great achievements have been recorded in China's 
implementing and safeguarding of human rights. These basic 
facts and favorable development trends were not given an 
objective and fair appraisal by the U.S. State Department's 
human rights report. On the contrary, it relied on hearsay, and 
especially believed rumor and slander spread by a few persons 
who vainly attempted to subvert the Chinese Government and 
overthrow China's socialist system. The report is a patchwork 
of allegations which contains censures of China. 
  Facts show that the U.S. State Department's human rights 
report is not really concerned with the interests and well- 
being of the broad masses of the Chinese people, but instead 
only concerned with the "human rights" of the handful of people 
who incited revolt, advocated the subversion of the Chinese 
Government and disrupted China's stability. 
  The issue of human rights is a major concern of people the 
world over, and enjoying full human rights is the common 
aspiration and objective of the people worldwide. The charter 
of the United Nations attaches great importance to human rights. 
Article 1 of the charter reads, the goal is "to achieve 
international cooperation in promoting and encouraging respect 
for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without 
distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion." In order 
to achieve this goal, Article 2 of the charter stipulates the 
principles to be followed by the United Nations and its member 
states. The first principle is the "principle of the sovereign 
equality of all its members," and the second principle states 
that "nothing contained in the present charter authorize the 
United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially 
within the domestic jurisdiction of any state." The U.S. 
Government which styles itself as the "judge of world human 
rights," publishes annual reports which examine the human rights 
situation in other countries, censuring the political, economic, 
social, cultural and judicial systems of other countries. 
Actions of this nature run counter to the spirit of the United 
Nations charter and add greater instability to an already 
unstable world. Such a report has naturally been criticized and 
censured by many countries. 
  Owing to the many different historical, cultural, social and 
national conditions in various countries, there have always been 
varied views on the question of human rights. Members of the 
international community should engage in dialogue and develop 
international cooperation on the basis of equality, while 
seeking common ground and preserving differences. Interaction 
such as this will help safeguard and improve the world human 
rights. The China society for human rights studies opposes the 
practice of imposing one's own views on others, and the 
hegemonism of those who intervene in the internal affairs of 
other countries and bring pressure to bear upon them under the 
pretext of human rights. China is a developing country, many 
aspects of its human rights situation have not as yet reached 
the desired level. Moreover, some 80 million Chinese people, or 
7 percent of the country's total population, still live in 
poverty. This is currently the most important and urgent human 
rights problem in China. The Chinese Government and many 
Chinese social organizations are applying themselves to the work 
of aiding the poor. The China Society for Human Rights Studies 
is greatly concerned with the human rights situation in China, a 
country with a population of nearly 1.2 billion, and in the rest 
of the world as well. It is eager to discuss questions related 
to human rights with personages and organizations of all 
countries in accordance with the principles of equality, 
fairness and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. 
It welcomes those who are truly concerned with the human rights 
situation of the masses of Chinese people to offer their 
valuable opinion, so as to bring about still greater progress in 
China's human rights situation.

<F P=106> [Article by Liang Yurong (2733 3768 2837): "Mechanism and </F>
Market, the Points To Start With in Improving Large and 
Medium-Sized State-Owned Enterprises"] 
  [Text] Large and medium-sized, state-owned enterprises 
constitute the mainstay of the socialist market economy and the 
endeavor to improve these enterprises has very important 
significance in economic development and social stability. 
Thus, it is a major event in China's current activities to 
proceed from reality in fully studying and understanding the 
measures for improving large and medium-sized, state-owned 
enterprises. 
  1. Transform Mechanism To Clarify Property Rights 
  The issue on clarifying enterprises' property rights or 
putting property rights in place is comprised of how to 
distribute the assets to individuals under the public economy so 
that both the public and individuals own public property. After 
several years of exploration, it can be said that the best way 
we have come up with is to promote the shareholding system at 
state-owned enterprises. 
  There are two patterns we can adopt in promoting the 
shareholding system: 
  One is to maintain the original property rights and draw in 
the shares of staff members and workers. This is a moderate and 
conservative therapy. The original state-owned assets, after 
being reappraised, serve as public shares, and then the shares 
of staff members and workers are drawn in. This not only helps 
separate ownership from management rights but also helps clarify 
the enterprises' property rights. 
  The other is to divide public property into the liability 
shares of staff members and workers. This is a larger-scale 
reform measure. The original state-owned assets are manifest as 
collective property, but it is difficult to see their micro 
embodiment. If we divide state-owned property into individual 
shares to make everyone possess specific property and then pool 
the property and turn the enterprises into shareholding 
enterprises, the property as a whole belongs to the public 
although the shares belong to individuals. This is not only an 
effective method to maintain public ownership under the new 
market economy but also an effective way to maintain and 
increase the value of state-owned assets. It is the 
continuation, not disintegration, of public ownership; and it is 
progress, not retrogression, of history. 
  In maintaining public ownership of state-owned assets, we 
may 
adopt two methods. One is to let the state or governments at 
all levels appoint representatives of property rights to execute 
the property rights of companies. The other is to appraise the 
current assets of state-owned enterprises and then lease them to 
individuals. 
  2. Establish a Modern Enterprise System and Turn Enterprises 
Into Companies 
  In a strict sense, both enterprises and companies are 
qualified, independent, legal persons and economic entities 
capable of independent operation. Why is it then, that 
enterprises are urged to transform into companies? In general, 
there are two categories of enterprises. There are those with 
one main investor and there are others that are partnership 
enterprises, with unlimited liabilities for their operation so 
that when enterprises go bankrupt, the investment partners not 
only lose the enterprises but also all their personal deposits 
and property. Companies that emerged later are actually all 
stock companies, whose prominent characteristic is the 
diversification of major investors and share of risks and 
interests. In the process of development and evolution, stock 
companies have gradually become ones with limited liabilities. 
That is, investors bear the risks of companies only within the 
limits of the stocks they invest, excluding other property. The 
limited liability stock companies and limited liability 
companies that have emerged, all shoulder limited liabilities 
only. From this, we have come to the initial conclusion that 
turning enterprises into companies means changing one 
owner-enterprises into companies with many investors and limited 
liability. 
  Large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises are 
enterprises invested solely by the state, and they are, as we 
often say, owned by the public. As the sole investor, the state 
holds unlimited liabilities for the enterprises. Heilongjiang's 
large and medium-sized enterprises have suffered losses year 
after year, their deficits have remained high, and two-thirds of 
them are in difficulty. However, most of them have not gone 
bankrupt. This is because the state holds unlimited liabilities 
for these enterprises. 
  How then, should large and medium-sized enterprises be 
turned 
into companies? Of the two methods that can be applied, one is 
to transform large and medium-sized, state-owned enterprises in 
line with the shareholding system. This not only helps 
pluralize investors but also enables the state to hold limited 
liabilities correlating to the capital investment amount. 
  The other is to turn large and medium-sized, state-owned 
enterprises into companies owned solely by the state. 
Transformation to the shareholding system is good, but extensive 
application is impossible for the time being. It is not that 
loss-making enterprises cannot be transformed in line with the 
shareholding system. It is that flexible methods should be 
adopted, such as auction, buying out, or quantifying the 
relatively profitable parts and turning them into shares to 
invest. The direct way out for loss-making enterprises is to 
turn them into companies first. That is, the existing 
state-owned enterprises are changed into limited liability 
companies solely invested by the state, and the state holds 
limited liability according to its current investment, no longer 
unlimited liability for continued losses. Property rights are 
delegated to enterprises thoroughly so that they operate 
independently and shoulder the responsibility should they go 
under. This may be the best way to enable enterprises to 
survive. 
  3. The Government Should Strengthen Service and, in 
Particular, Cultivate and Improve the Market System to Improve 
Large and Medium-Sized, State-Run Enterprises, . 
  Speeding up the cultivation and improvement of the market 
system is a guarantee for transforming mechanisms and 
invigorating enterprises and also an important function of the 
government. In this regard, a good job should be done in three 
aspects. First, we should do a good job in building markets to 
establish the market networks more rapidly. Currently, 
Heilongjiang has yet to build stock markets, labor markets, 
futures markets, cultural markets, and enterprise markets, and 
it should transform its various types of markets into open ones 
with advanced facilities and complete functions, which can play 
a wide radiating role. Second, we should accelerate economic 
legislation and establishment of the market mechanism. Third, 
we should strengthen the coordination and control of some 
markets that monopolize the business of some essential elements 
of production. Some essential elements of production, such as 
funds, railways, and transportation, are seriously restricting 
Heilongjiang's enterprise production. Under conditions where 
these essential elements of production are under unified 
management by the central authorities, the government should 
make positive efforts in coordinate and control to ensure a 
reasonable distribution of the existing essential elements of 
production.

  [Text] Beijing, 30 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Wu Yi, 
minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said during 
a recent interview with reporters that in the first 4 months of 
this year, China's foreign trade developed very rapidly; imports 
and exports increased significantly, and, in particular, exports 
development accelerated; and that the state's foreign exchange 
balance has increased. 
  Wu Yi said that this year, China's foreign trade has been 
developing rapidly, healthily, and in a coordinated manner. It 
mainly has the following four characteristics: 
  --Import and export trade grew significantly. According to 
statistics from the customs department, total import and export 
value reached $57.84 billion, an increase of 21.1 percent over 
the same period of last year, and this speed was quite high 
compared with the same periods of recent years. 
  --Exports accelerated. In the first 4 months of this year, 
export value reached $28.04 billion, a 22 percent increase over 
the same period of last year. What is noteworthy is that the 
general trade export, which had not performed well in recent 
years, grew rapidly, with an increase of 30.5 percent, 
surpassing the 22.1 percent growth in the processing trade 
exports. This was a good trend not seen in the past few years. 
  --Imports slowed down. In the first 4 months of this year, 
the import value was $29.79 billion, 20.3 percent increase over 
the same period of last year. Judged from absolute value, 
import and export volumes were very close, and judged by 
development trends, a balance between import and export is 
feasible. 
  --Settlement of exchange is bigger than sale of exchange, 
the 
foreign trade situation in the whole country is quite good, and 
the state's foreign exchange reserve is bigger than earlier this 
year. 
  Wu Yi said frankly that China's foreign trade and economic 
work is also faced with some difficulties and problems, and the 
more acute ones are: Enterprises still have a tight supply of 
circulation funds, purchase price of export commodities are 
increasingly too rapidly, and foreign trade and export lack 
staying power.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report from the "Regional News Hookup" </F>
program] 
  [Text] Since the promulgation of the PRC Law on Regional 
National Autonomy a decade ago, Tibet has attached importance to 
training nationality cadres in the scientific and technological 
[S&amp;T] field. Of the entire region's 28,000 scientific and 
technological cadres, over 17,000, or 62 percent, are Tibetans 
and other minority nationalities. Currently, Tibet has built up 
a S&amp;T force that consists of mainly Tibetans, the region's 
new 
force in economic and educational development. 
  In the past decade, the Tibetan party and government at 
various levels, as well as organization and personnel 
departments, have shown earnest concern about the growth and 
progress of nationality cadres in the S&amp;T field. By 
conducting 
educational activities through various means and channels, they 
actively created conditions to upgrade the professional quality 
of S&amp;T personnel of Tibetan and other minority nationalities. 
First, short training classes were held. In accordance with 
the educational standards of S&amp;T personnel as well as 
development in modern science and technology, experts and 
professors of S&amp;T departments and institutes of higher 
learning 
were employed to conduct training classes or special lectures in 
Tibet. Second, personnel were sent out of the region for further 
study. In the past few years, a group of S&amp;T personnel was 
selected for further study in institutes of higher learning or 
for inspection and study tours in other countries and regions. 
Third, nationality S&amp;T personnel were given responsibilities 
in 
key S&amp;T research projects, and exchanges and cooperation in 
academic studies were frequently held to upgrade their research 
and academic standards in application. 
  In the past few years, the regional party committee and 
government at various levels, as well as organization and 
personnel departments, have done practical work for Tibet's 
nationality cadres in the S&amp;T field despite a severe fund 
shortage. Funds for S&amp;T cadres were utilized to support 
scientific research, thereby creating conditions for submission 
of reports and appraisals of S&amp;T achievements. Constructions 
of 
offices and housing were quickened and efforts were made to 
improve the personnel's working and living conditions. The 
region certified the qualifications of 324 veteran Tibetan 
intellectuals that were obtained before 1959. Currently, our 
region's S&amp;T force is stable and young, with 44 Tibetans and 
other minority nationalities aged below 40 holding high-ranking 
positions, mainly in medical, animal husbandry, and social 
science departments. They are proficient in the Chinese 
language and possess fairly high professional standards. 
  In the past decade, the number of Tibet's nationality 
S&amp;T 
personnel has grown by 20 percent annually. Tibet has trained a 
national S&amp;T force that possesses specific strength and is 
full 
of dedicated spirit and patriotic enthusiasm.

  [Text] A senior journalist known for his pro-Beijing 
stance has been appointed ATV's news controller, prompting 
concerns over the station's future editorial policies. Leung 
Yu-shing's appointment follows a week of controversy at the 
station, during which the acting news controller, Poon Fu-yim, 
and five other senior staff resigned. 
  The six were angry over the ATV management's interference in 
the screening of footage from a Spanish documentary on the 1989 
Tiananmen Square massacre. The programme was eventually aired 
as originally scheduled last Saturday [4 June]. 
  ATV announced Leung's appointment after the station's chief 
executive officer, Mark Lee, and the deputy chief executive, 
Clarence Chang, appeared with the six resigning staff at a 
Legislative Council hearing into the controversy on Monday 
evening. 
  Leung has served in senior positions in a number of news 
organisations, including the former RTV [Rediffusion 
Television], RTHK [Radio Television Hong Kong), and the 
Chinese-language newspapers Sing Tao [SING TAO JIH PAO], Wah Kiu 
[HUA CHIAO JIH PAO], and Express [KUAI PAO]. 
  Leung's most recent position was as publisher of the 
Chinese- 
language magazine Pai Shing [PAI HSING], which has folded. 
Leung joined the magazine when it was bought by a pro-China 
businessman, Tsui Tsin-tong, and turned from a fortnightly to a 
weekly publication. Under Leung's leadership, the magazine was 
criticised by readers and journalists for publishing 
"Beijing-friendly" articles in contrast to its previous critical 
stance. 
  Tsui announced late last year that he would not continue 
supporting the magazine. It became a monthly publication and 
Leung resigned at the same time. The magazine ceased 
publication last month. 
  ATV did not mention Leung's record with Pai Shing in the 
press release on his appointment as the news controller. 
Leung's service on the executive committee of the News 
Executive Association has also contributed little to the 
confidence of journalists in his commitment to press freedom. 
"Management won't need to interfere in the news department any 
more," one journalist said. "Leung will do their work for them." 
  An ATV source said the management only decided on Leung's 
appointment on Sunday. The source said the management was in a 
rush to replace Poon and the others, because they felt they 
could no longer trust them, and Leung, unemployed since leaving 
Pai Shing, was immediately available. 
  The chairwoman of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, 
Daisy Li, said she hoped the ATV news department would have 
genuine editorial autonomy in future, and not just superficial 
autonomy over its output. The union will meet with the six 
resigning ATV staff on Saturday to consider ways to avoid 
similar controversies. 
  The spokesman for the Press Freedom Action Group, Chung 
Cho-hong, said he was troubled by Leung's appointment. 
"Handling of the news depends on a lot of human factors," Chung 
said. "So we are troubled that they hire someone with this kind 
of background." 
  The group has called for Lee to make a public apology over 
the Spanish documentary incident, and has collected more than 
2,000 signatures on a petition calling for Chang to resign. 
Chung said his group will not go ahead with a threatened hunger 
strike outside ATV's Broadcast Drive studio, and will reconsider 
its next step. 
  Legislative Councillors on Monday called for new television 
licensing conditions to safeguard the editorial independence of 
television news departments.

  [Text] Beijing, 8 Jun (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, CPC Central 
Committee general secretary; Li Peng, State Council premier; and 
Qiao Shi, National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee 
chairman, recently gave important written instructions on 
comprehensive management of public security in rural areas and 
for a national meeting in Suzhou on the comprehensive management 
of public security in rural areas. 
  Jiang Zemin's written instructions were: Public security in 
rural areas has an extremely important effect on their stability 
and develolpment, and even on the whole country's stability and 
development. The current meeting held by the Central Committee 
for Comprehensive Management of Public Security [CCCMPS] is very 
important. Party and government leaders at all levels should 
earnestly carry out all measures laid down by the meeting, 
address themselves to practicing comprehensive management of 
public security in rural areas, and strive to noticeably improve 
public security situations in rural areas within a relatively 
short period. 
  Li Peng's written instructions were: Ensuring good 
comprehensive management of public security in rural areas is an 
unshirkable responsibility of governments at all levels, 
particularly governments at the county and at the township and 
town levels. Governments at all levels should strengthen 
leadership and endeavor to carry out the CCCMPS's struggle aimed 
at improving public security in rural areas; they must make 
unremitting efforts to achieve practical results. All 
government departments concerned should actively participate in 
the work and provide necessary manpower, financial, and material 
support, to create necessary conditions for rural economic 
development and for the people to live and work in peace and 
contentment. 
  Qiao Shi's written instructions were: To ensure good public 
security in rural areas, we must adhere to the principle of 
comprehensive management. In particular, we should rally the 
enthusiasm of party members, cadres, and peasants in rural areas 
and step up our efforts to promote democracy and the rule of law 
in rural areas. I hope the CCCMPS will make the current meeting 
successful and ensure that all decided measures are truly 
carried out.

  [Text] Beijing, June 9 (XINHUA) -- China hopes that the 
concerned parties to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula 
should keep calm and restraint and not close the door for 
negotiations easily. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang made the remarks at 
a 
press conference held here this afternoon when asked to expound 
China's views on the latest developments on the issue. 
  China is very much concerned over the latest developments 
over the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula, Shen said, and 
hopes that all the directly concerned parties should make 
further efforts to start talks so as to seek a peaceful 
resolution of the issue. 
  He stated that the Chinese side advocates two basic targets 
in solving the issue, that is, to realize final denuclearization 
of the peninsula and to safeguard peace and stability there.

  [Text] Beijing, June 9 (AFP)--China rejected Thursday 
South Korea's last-ditch efforts to persuade it to support 
economic sanctions against North Korea, urging the parties 
concerned to return to talks to avert a confrontation. 
  Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told his visiting 
counterpart Han Sung-chu during a working breakfast that "we are 
not in favour of UN Security Council involvement in this issue." 
  "We do not agree on sanctions, for sanctions would only 
serve 
to push the parties concerned into confrontation with one 
another and result in a situation that no one would like to 
see," Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang quoted Qian as 
saying. 
  Asked if Beijing believed Pyongyang would actually follow 
through with its threats of war if faced with sanctions, Shen 
simply said, "it is hard to predict how the DPRK would react to 
sanctions, but at the very least sanctions are not a good 
choice." 
  Qian's remarks came shortly before the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) governors were due to meet in Vienna to 
discuss the recent escalation in the Korean crisis, sparked by 
fears that Pyongyang was diverting plutonium from its Yongbon 
reactor to make nuclear weapons. 
  Han arrived here Wednesday from the United States for a 
lightning stopover in a bid to persuade China, a permanent 
member of the UN Security Council and Stalinist North Korea's 
only major ally, to endorse economic sanctions against 
Pyongyang. He left for Seoul later Thursday. 
  Shen quoted Qian as telling Han that "although there are 
some 
difficulties now, the parties concerned should still remain calm 
and concentrate on exercising restraint instead of closing the 
door to negotiations." 
  In the past, negotiations had achieved some progress, he 
said, but added that more recently the parties concerned -- 
namely the United States, the two Koreas and the IAEA -- "failed 
to reach consensus concerning technical issues leading to a 
dramatic change in the situation." 
  He was referring to North Korea's failure to allow IAEA 
inspectors to monitor properly the discharging of fuel rods from 
the five-megawatt Yongbyon reactor. 
  The inspectors said in a recent report they could no longer 
guarantee that plutonium had not been diverted during the 
operation. 
  Asked to elaborate on South Korean reports that Qian pledged 
to Han that China would make its "best efforts" to resolve the 
crisis, Shen said the foreign minister was referring to 
Beijing's willingness to play "a bigger role" to try to bring 
the parties back to the negotiating table. 
  A U.S. State Department spokesman said Wednesday it was now 
too late for Washington, which is pushing for sanctions, to 
resume direct talks with Pyongyang. 
  Shen warned that if any parties sought to resolve the crisis 
outside the framework of negotiations, "it will possibly lead to 
a downturn in the situation and lead the situation to a critical 
point." 
  "It is only through such negotiations that the situation can 
be accorded a settlement," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, June 9 (AFP)--The Chinese Government on 
Thursday accused German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and 
Danielle Mitterrand of exploiting dissident Wang Juntao to 
promote "political activities" against Beijing. 
  "Wang Juntao was allowed to go abroad to receive medical 
treatment," a foreign ministry spokesman said by phone. 
  "We are against anyone making use of Wang Juntao in any form 
to carry out political activities against the Chinese 
government." 
  Wang, 35, had been sentenced to 13 years in jail for his 
role 
in the 1989 pro-democracy movement, but was released last month 
on medical grounds and put aboard a plane for the United States. 
  He made a private trip to France to commemorate the fifth 
anniversary of the June 4 crackdown in Tiananmen Square, and met 
Mitterrand -- the wife of French President Francois Mitterrand 
-- who chairs a human rights group known as France-Liberte. 
  Wang met Kinkel in Bonn on Tuesday before heading back to 
the 
United States.

  [Text] Luanda, June 8 (XINHUA) -- The United States holds 
that Luanda's agreement to accommodate the rebel National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in a future cabinet 
is "an encouraging initiative." 
  Speaking to the local press here today, U.S. Ambassador to 
Angola Joseph Schreiber said the United States, Russia and 
Portugal -- three observer countries of the Angolan peace 
process -- believe the initiative benefits the ongoing peace 
talks in Lusaka, capital of Zambia. 
  Luanda has reportedly agreed to give unita the four 
portfolios of mineral, health, trade and travel, seven 
deputy-minister posts of finance, agriculture, interior, 
defense, social rehabilitation, communication and public works, 
as well as governors of Kuando-Kubango, Uige and Lunda-Sul 
Provinces, deputy governors of several other provinces. 
  The United States firmly supports U.N. Special Envoy to 
Angola Blondin Beye in his efforts to bring lasting peace and 
reconciliation to the Angolan people, the ambassador said. 
  Beye had proposed the government accommodate the UNITA in a 
future cabinet. 
  He said the United States will shoulder 30 percent of U.N. 
expenses for peacekeeping missions in the southern African 
country.

  [Text] Dhaka, June 8 (XINHUA) -- Nearly 60 participants 
from 10 Asian countries gathered here from June 7 to 8 to attend 
a workshop on human development report 1994 of the United 
Nations Development Program (UNDP). [sentence as received] 
  The workshop was aimed to collect suggestions and opinions 
for the world summit for social development which is set to meet 
in Copenhagen in March 1995, according to UNDP officials. 
  At the two-day meeting, the participants from Bangladesh, 
China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, 
Sri Lanka and the Philippines agreed that the post-Cold War 
world is still facing the two major issues -- peace and 
development. 
  They held that without peace, there may be no development, 
while without development, peace is threatened, and for this 
purpose, the UN system requires a clearer mandate, integrated 
policy frameworks and additional resources. 
  According to the meeting, the UNDP, in its 1994 report, has 
explored the new frontiers of human security in the daily life 
of the people. 
  The report says that behind the blaring headlines of the 
world's many conflicts and emergencies, there lies a silent 
crisis -- a crisis of underdevelopment, of global poverty, of 
ever-mounting population pressure, of thoughtless degradation of 
environment. 
  During the discussions, the participants said both the 
developing countries and developed countries are facing their 
own problems. 
  For the developing nations, their top task is to develop 
their own economy self-reliantly in accordance with the 
practical situation so as to bolster the development of 
education, healthcare and social security sectors, they insisted. 
  Yang Qingwei, an official from China's State Commission for 
Planning who participated in the workshop, said that China is 
facing problems similar to those of other developing countries 
in the human development field. 
  Since China adopted the reform and opening policy 15 years 
ago, the country has achieved remarkable progress in developing 
its economy, which has consequently boosted the social 
development, Yang noted. 
  He said China should gradually improve the internal 
mechanism 
of social development through strengthening the macro-control 
over its economy while pushing forward the development of the 
education, healthcare and social security sectors in a bid to 
meet the requirements of forming a market economy in the country.

  [Text] Geneva, June 8 (XINHUA) -- After hard bargaining 
over the past three days, the warring factions in Bosnia agreed 
here today to a month-long cease-fire that will take effect at 
noon (1000 GMT) on Friday [10 June]. 
  Speaking to reporters after the agreement was signed, 
Yasushi 
Akashi, the U.N. envoy to the former Yugoslavia, said the 
cease-fire includes an exchange of prisoners and information on 
those still listed as missing. 
  The agreement was inked by top representatives of the 
Bosnia's Muslim-Croat Federation and the Bosnian Serbs. 
  Akashi described the agreement as a "first step" toward the 
full-scale cease-fire in Bosnia. 
  Under the agreement, the parties will resume negotiations in 
near future to seek a full-scale cease-fire. 
  Akashi had been pressing for a four-month cease-fire, the 
Bosnian Serbs had demanded a one-year halt of hostilities and 
the Muslim-Croat Federation had wanted a month-long agreement.

  [Text] Geneva, June 8 (XINHUA) -- After hard bargaining 
over the past three days, the warring factions in Bosnia agreed 
here today to a month-long ceasefire, the first of its kind in 
more than two years of bloody conflict. 
  The accord, signed by top representatives of the Bosnia's 
Muslim-Croat Federation and Serbs in the form of a statement, 
will take effect at noon (1000 GMT) on Friday [10 June]. 
  As a first step both sides agreed to avoid any offensive or 
provocative military operations and give time to broader truce 
negotiations. 
  "This period of military stabilisation is required in order 
to give time for reflection leading to a resumption, within the 
next several days, under U.N. Protection Force (Unprofor) 
auspices, of negotiations on a comprehensive cessation of 
hostilities," said the statement released here. 
  Speaking to reporters after signing the agreement, Yasushi 
Akashi, the U.N. envoy to the former Yugoslavia, said the 
ceasefire is a "first step" toward the overall truce in the 
war-torn Bosnia. 
  However, he admitted it fell short of his four-month 
ceasefire target sought in the past three days of talks here. 
  "But under the circumstances such a more ambitious 
undertaking was not within reach," he added. 
  He said that the Unprofor would convene negotiations within 
a 
few days either in Sarajevo, Pale (Bosnian Serbs' stronghold) or 
at Sarajevo airport. 
  Meanwhile, the U.N. force will continue to monitor and 
report 
all military activity along the present line of conflict, the 
statement said. 
  The accord also provided for an "immediate and complete" 
release of all prisoners of war under the auspices of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). 
  Akashi said that the accord was a "short agreement reached 
after a great deal of effort," referring to the long mediation 
drive by the international community. 
  Last month major power ministers met in Geneva, where they 
made a call for cessation of hostilities to be followed by 
territorial negotiations in the former Yugoslav Republic. 
  The major power "contact group" on Bosnia asked Akashi and 
his military commanders to negotiate the ceasefire. 
  Under the terms of Akashi's original proposal, a ceasefire 
would have been followed quickly by separation of forces, 
withdrawal of heavy weapons and the interposition of some 5,000 
extra peacekeeping troops along front lines. 
  However, the warring sides had long argument over the 
duration of the proposed truce. 
  The Bosnian Serbs had accepted Akashi's original proposal, 
but the Bosnian Muslims and Croats had resisted a long 
ceasefire, fearing it would cement Serbs' military gains on the 
ground. 
  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic told reporters after 
signing the accord today that he had accepted a "moderate 
result" for the sake of peace, while leaders of the Muslim-Croat 
Federation seemed also pleased by the result.

  [Text] New York, June 8 (XINHUA) -- Some 129 U.S. research 
teams planned to carry out various experiments aboard Russia's 
Mir space station between 1995 and 1997, a report said today. 
  A news release from Boeing Defense and Space Group said some 
129 research teams have submitted proposals to the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in response to a 
NASA research announcement. The science proposals are directed 
at research in environmental monitoring, biomedical applied 
physiology, human factors, fundamental biology on humans, lower 
vertebrates, non-vertebrate animals and plant life, and for 
research to develop advanced technologies for life support. 
  As part of its restructured space station program, NASA will 
be cooperating with the Russian space agency to conduct as many 
as ten shuttle flights to the Mir space station from 1995-1997. 
During this period, U.S. astronauts will be on board Mir for 
four missions, the first lasting 90 days and the next three 
lasting 180 days each. The research announcement the science 
teams have responded to presents the opportunity to conduct 
long-duration microgravity experiments during these four flights.

  [Text] Washington, June 8 (XINHUA) -- The World Bank 
approved today a loan of 200 million U.S. dollars to support 
China's efforts to protect its forests and increase timber 
production. 
  The loan will be used to "help preserve biodiversity in five 
key nature reserves in China and reduce soil erosion and 
flooding," the bank said in a statement. 
  The project, totaling 356 million dollars, is expected to 
generate six billion dollars in China's domestic wood products 
in 33 years, the bank said. 
  China is the world's third largest consumer of timber, using 
300 million cubic meters a year. Burgeoning demand and limited 
supply are creating a worsening imbalance. 
  About 500,000 hectares of forest area are lost each year in 
China. 
  The loan will build 620,000 hectares of managed timber 
plantations, set up 280,000 hectares of multiple-use forests, 
strengthen biodiversity conservation, and support technology 
transfer, the bank said.

  [Text] Washington, June 8 (XINHUA) -- The World Bank 
approved a loan of 380 million U.S. dollars here today to 
support the national highway project in China. 
  The loan, the bank said, will be used to build the 340 
kilometer superhighway between Shijiazhuang and Xinxiang in 
central China, which is part of the divided, four-lane 
Beijing-Shenzhen expressway. 
  The part of highway supported by the bank, according to 
senior bank transport specialist Hatim Hajj, is one of the most 
heavily traveled corridors in China. 
  Highway traffic in China grew 14.1 percent between 1982 and 
1992. China is now planning to construct a 25,000 kilometer 
national highway system equivalent to the U.S. interstate 
system, the bank said. 
  Bank lending to the highway sector in China since 1981 
totals 
over one billion dollars.

  [Text] Haikou, June 9 (XINHUA) -- More than 60 
entrepreneurs and economists from 26 provinces and cities across 
China gathered in Haikou City, capital of Hainan Province, to 
discuss the prospects of cooperation with southeast Asian 
counterparts. 
  At a symposium, the economists and entrepreneurs noted that 
the trade value between China and Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand 
and the Philippines last year exceeded one billion U.S. dollars, 
an increase of 26 percent over the previous year. 
  In recent years, investment in China by Southeast Asian 
countries has amounted to two billion U.S. dollars. 
  Meanwhile, in Southeast Asian countries, there are also 
about 
300 Chinese-funded enterprises with many construction projects. 
  They held that with the economic growth in the region, 
economic cooperation between China and Southeast Asian countries 
has broad prospects. 
  At the symposium held in Haikou City, the Chinese economists 
and entrepreneurs established a commercial committee under the 
China Society of Southeast Asian Studies. 
  Chen Luzhi, director of the committee, said that it will 
render consulting services and arrange business talks, academic 
exchanges and information exchanges between Chinese businessmen 
and their counterparts in Southeast Asian countries.

  [Text] Washington, June 8 (XINHUA) -- A senior U.S. 
Administration official said Wednesday [8 June] that president 
Clinton's decision to unconditionally renew China's 
most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status will result in a 
long-term, mature and evolving relationship with what is 
becoming one of the world's most powerful economic forces. 
  Speaking at the annual meeting of the U.S.-China Business 
Council, Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to the president for 
economic policy, said, "we will oppose any attempts in Congress 
to reverse this decision." 
  "In very plain words, this is an issue we should get behind 
us...it's time now to move toward the definition and the 
development of our next steps," he added. 
  He said that the U.S. relationship with China must include 
"full engagement" and "constant dialogue." 
  "A growing economic relationship is anticipated," he 
stressed. 
  However, he cautioned, "we should be realistic about the 
economic relationship... There will be disagreements but we 
think that a mature and growing relationship can work through 
them." 
  He described this relationship as one that "must be 
characterized by a mutual recognition of strategic importance." 
  Cutter also indicated that the U.S. will "insist upon a 
continued focus on democracy and human rights" in its relations 
with China.

<F P=106> ["International Forum" column by Gu Ping (0657 1627): "More </F>
Respect, Less Threats"] 
  [Text] The United States has adopted diplomatic measures 
one after another in Asia within a short period of only a few 
days: It reached agreement with Japan to resume trade talks, it 
renewed China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status and 
delinked human rights from trade, it agreed with Vietnam on 
mutually establishing official liaison offices, and it is 
willing to resume high-level talks with the DPRK. At the same 
time, there are reports that the United States is drastically 
transferring its officials responsible for Asian affairs. 
People with discerning eyes know well that the Clinton 
administration is readjusting its Asia policies to improve ties 
with Asia. 
  For some time, the United States has experienced 
difficulties 
in Asia. In the U.S.-Japanese trade talks, it insisted on 
taking a tough stand on "numerical targets." As Japan refused 
to give in, economic and trade ties between the two countries 
were unprecedentedly tense. On ties with China, the United 
States took the question of human rights as an excuse to 
wantonly interfere in and condemn China's internal affairs, 
which was naturally opposed by China. On the question of the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, the United States 
threatened to impose sanctions against the DPRK, while the ROK, 
Japan, and other countries intend to resolve the problem through 
dialogue and consultations. Moreover, the United States has 
also had disputes and quarrels with many other Asian nations on 
a series of issues. The United States meddled in the sentence 
passed on an American youth by Singapore for damaging public and 
private property and forced Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand to 
make concessions and accept U.S. requirements on labor, 
intellectual property rights, and other issues.... 
  These aggressive U.S. policies have thrown it into a 
predicament in Asia. Moreover, they have also invited fierce 
criticism from the media at home and upset a number of 
government figures. U.S. papers have commented on the failure 
of U.S. policy toward Asia, describing it as "a train moving 
toward a steep cliff." In a memo to the Secretary of State 
written not long ago, a senior official in the State Department 
warned candidly that "relations between the United States and 
Asia have reached a critical stage." "Unless the principles are 
appropriately readjusted, we may damage U.S. influence and 
interests." 
  It is ironic that U.S. Asia policy has run aground at 
precisely the time when the United States has continuously 
asserted that it "attaches importance to Asia" and intends to 
make Asia its "new friend." Since last year, the Clinton 
administration has clearly placed "economic security" at the top 
of its three major diplomatic goals. For this reason, President 
Clinton presided over the unofficial APEC meeting in Seattle 
last November in a bid to use Asia's economic prosperity and 
huge market to promote U.S. economic recovery and consolidate 
its "global leading position." As a matter of fact, the United 
States should have maintained good relations of trust with Asia 
in order to safeguard its economic and geopolitical interests. 
In its contacts with the developing Asian nations, however, the 
United States has considered itself to be a "big brother," used 
its strength to bully the weak, frequently made indiscreet 
remarks on the internal affairs of other countries, and even 
tried to impose its ideology and values on others. This cannot 
but evoke criticisms and objection from Asian nations. 
Moreover, these efforts by the United States in Asia will also 
fall through. Such results, which run counter to its desires, 
have precisely exposed the problems in U.S. policy toward Asia. 
  If the United States wants to improve relations with Asian 
nations, it must acquire a deeper understanding of Asia's 
reality; respect the social systems, cultural traditions, and 
values of Asian nations; and get along with Asian countries 
based on an equal footing. In a word, unless the United States 
forsakes its "dominating" power politics of bullying others 
using the advantage of its strength, it will be impossible for 
it to restore its Asian diplomacy. It is time to pay more 
respect and make less threats to Asian nations.

<F P=106> ["Political Talk" column article by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 </F>
3768): "Clinton Reiterates that the United States Attaches 
Importance to Europe"] 
  [Text] Clinton Delivered a Speech at the French 
National Assembly 
  The commemorative activities solemnly conducted to mark the 
50th anniversary of the landing on the Normandy coast by the 
Allied Forces on 6 June a half-century ago is over. Taking 
advantage of participating in this activity, Clinton also 
visited several countries, including Italy, Britain, France, and 
so on, where he has made a series of speeches. When invited to 
address the French National Assembly at 1700, 7 June, his 
remarks on overall U.S. policy in Europe were followed with 
highest interest. This is Clinton's first visit to France since 
he took office as U.S. President. 
  He said emphatically, among other things, that "although 
Europe will be integrated, the United States will still 
strengthen its relationship with Europe. For this reason, the 
United States hopes to see an even more powerful Europe. A 
powerful Europe is the prerequisite for promoting this 
integration, so the United States will give positive support to 
it. Given the reduction of U.S. forces in Europe, the United 
States will still take the security in Europe very seriously." 
  In fact, there is nothing new in these remarks. The United 
States always pays serious attention to Europe. Even though 
there are signs that the goal of U.S. economic development has 
been "shifted from Europe to Asia" owing to the economic 
slowdown in Europe and the United States itself, yet this does 
not mean that it has ceased to attach importance to Europe. 
Now, Clinton sang the old tune at the French National Assembly 
again, which reflects that the relationship of allies between 
Europe and the United States has not come to an end. Instead, 
taking the 50th anniversary of the D-Day as a juncture, it will 
begin all over again from a new starting point. 
<H5>  Looking Forward to the Future in Europe </H5>
  Viewing the changes in Europe since the D-Day half a century 
ago, people have all sorts of feelings well up in their minds. 
However, it is more necessary for them to look into the future 
with regard to how Europe and the United States will maintain 
peace and development in Europe. 
  The landing on the Normandy coast in 1944 was the largest 
campaign in the European history. Paris was liberated in August 
that year. Seeing that not much could be done to save the 
situation, Hitler committed suicide and was burnt to death in 
May the next year, and then Nazi-Germany surrendered 
unconditionally. At this time, the two arch-criminals who 
started the war in Europe -- Mussolini (who was hanged in public 
with his corpse was lashed afterward) and Hitler had come to an 
ignominious end and had left their bad names that will stink 
through the ages. 
  After the end of World War II, Western Europe was in a state 
of serious devastation and numerous tasks remained to be 
undertaken. The U.S. Marshall aid plan made considerable 
contributions to the rejuvenation in Europe. The Coal and Steel 
Union, which was the predecessor of the Common Market, was set 
up in Western Europe, and was the embryonic form of an economic 
integration. Under NATO's protection over the past 50 years, 
Europe has advanced from a community to a political union of 
today, and will ultimately move toward an integrated Europe. 
<H5>  It Is Difficult To Resolve the Yugoslav Issue </H5>
  After the end of the Cold War in which the East and the West 
confronted each other, Europe eventually headed for 
reconciliation. However, new problems have cropped up again, the 
most thorny one being the national dispute in the former 
Yugoslavia which has bedeviled the European countries, and 
which, so far, has shown no signs of a solution. This problem 
also exposed the insufficient strength in Europe and tested its 
inferior ability for coordination. Now there is another problem 
of sending U.S. troops to Bosnia, which has exposed U.S. 
intentions of establishing its own European defense beyond the 
pale of NATO, and has aroused inharmonious arguments between 
Europe and the United States. If the situation worsens, the two 
sides will lose their mutual trust. 
  The Balkan region is also in a state of unrest, as Greece 
and 
the Republic of Macedonia, a territory of the former Yugoslavia, 
are at odds with swords drawn and bows bent, and Albania and 
Italy are on bad terms over disputes about illegal emigrants. 
All this shows that Europe lacks strength to cope with their 
internal conflicts and difficulties. 
  In addition, people are greatly worried about how the large 
number of heavy nuclear warheads will be handled if the 
turbulent situation in Ukraine worsens. What is more, Europe 
has not pulled out of its economic recession at present, and the 
unemployment rate remains at 13 percent, with the total number 
of unemployed people (excluding those in Eastern European 
Russia) reaching 30 million. Against this background, although 
the United States and Europe can still be allies, yet they are 
confronted with more complicated political and economic problems 
than before. This is a new reality that the United States and 
Europe must face.

<F P=106> [By Pei Jianfeng: "Research Refutes US Suit Alleging Metals </F>
Dumping"] 
  [Text] Metals experts declared yesterday that a US 
manufacturers' anti-dumping lawsuit against Chinese exporters of 
magnesium ingot is groundless. 
  Until 1992, China exported virtually no metallic magnesium 
to 
the United States, researchers from Antaike Information Company 
said. 
  In the past two years, exports of magnesium ingot to the US 
have grown quickly, but still only account for a small 
percentage of the US market, said the researchers, who work 
under the China National Non-ferrous Metals Industry Corporation. 
  US manufacturers last month accused seven Chinese companies 
of dumping metallic magnesium at a much lower price than the 
market standard. Product dumping is usually intended to garner 
a bigger slice of that nation's market. 
  The mainland exported 1,090 tons of magnesium ingot to 
American 1992, according to the General Administration of 
Customs. 
  Exports rose to 1,148 tons last year, about 5 percent of 
total US imports of metallic magnesium. 
  But imports from China only account for 2 percent of the 
total consumption in the United States, the information company 
said. 
  The lawsuit is based on US manufacturers' little knowledge 
of 
the magnesium industry in China, company experts said. 
  China is rich in magnesium resources, with 62 smelting 
factories across the country, but only 5 State-owned. 
  Since the 1980s, the industry has expanded rapidly. Annual 
production capacity has now reached 20,000 tons, far 
outstripping domestic demand. 
  Excessive imports from the Commonwealth of Independent 
States 
through barter trade also swelled supply on the domestic market. 
  The State is urging domestic producers to face this outlook 
head- on and turn their eyes to the world market. 
  Exports amounted to 7,456 tons last year, up 118 percent 
over 
1992 and prices are higher than their production costs. 
  The Minhe Magnesium Factory, in Qinghai Province, is China's 
largest producer with an annual output of 4,000 tons.

  [Text] Washington, June 8 (XINHUA) -- The United States is 
determined to take further steps to restore democracy in Haiti, 
a special adviser to the U.S. President on Haiti said here today. 
  "Further steps will be taken in the coming days and weeks," 
said William Gray at a hearing of the House Committee on Foreign 
Affairs. 
  "No options have been excluded. Democracy in Haiti will 
prevail," Gray said, "neither we nor the Haitian people can long 
wait for this event." 
  He stressed that the U.S. interest requires the restoration 
of the democratic process in Haiti and the return of the 
duly-elected Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
  Asked if a military intervention in Haiti is imminent, Gray 
said that "it is not imminent, at this time, that any is being 
planned other than those diplomatic actions which have been 
stated." [sentence as received] 
  "Our policy right now is to continue to press with the 
international community on the sanctions" against Haiti, Gray 
added.

  [Text] Beijing, June 8 KYODO -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu arrived in Beijing late Wednesday [8 June] 
for talks with Chinese officials. 
  The visit comes amid a flurry of diplomatic exchanges as the 
U.N. Security Council considers implementing sanctions on North 
Korea over its suspected nuclear development program. 
  Han's two-day visit will officially start with an 8 a.m. 
breakfast with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on Thursday, 
a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said. 
  North Korea, suspected of building a secret nuclear weapons 
program, has refused international inspections of its 
experimental nuclear reactor, thus violating the nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty of which it is a signatory. 
  On Tuesday, North Korea's army Chief of Staff Choe Kwang met 
with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, in what was believed to be a 
meeting concerning the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  Meanwhile, South Korea's YONHAP NEWS AGENCY quoted Han as 
saying in New York on Tuesday that North Korea will be unable to 
avoid Security Council sanctions if it fails to change its 
stance on the nuclear issue. 
  Han, speaking to South Korean reporters shortly before 
leaving New York for Beijing, reportedly said the situation 
surrounding the nuclear dispute could change for the better 
within days if Pyongyang cooperates with the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the issue of nuclear inspections. 
  "If not, North Korea could not avoid U.N. economic 
sanctions," Han was quoted as saying. 
  He said an overwhelming majority of Security Council members 
had indicated they are prepared to take strong action against 
North Korea, though a Council resolution would not come until 
after next week.

  [Text] Beijing, June 9 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen had a working meeting here today 
with Han Sung-chu, minister of foreign affairs of the Republic 
of Korea (ROK). 
  Han briefed Qian on the latest developments centering on the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  Stating China's point of view on the current situation, Qian 
pointed out that, with the efforts of the parties concerned, not 
long ago the development on the issue was in a positive 
direction. 
  But recently, he continued, due to disputes between the 
International Atomic Energy Agency and the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea about the inspection of the replacement of 
fuel rods the situation has taken a sudden turn, and the Chinese 
side has shown much concern about this. 
  He stated that the Chinese side advocates two basic targets 
for efforts to solve the issue: the denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula and the safeguarding of peace and stability 
there. 
  He said that these targets are in the fundamental interests 
of all the countries in Northeast Asia. 
  Facing the current difficulty, Qian pointed out, it is 
particularly necessary for the concerned parties to keep calm 
and restraint, and not to close the door to negotiations rashly. 
  He stated, "We call on all the parties directly concerned to 
make further efforts to start talks so as to leave room and keep 
possibilities alive for the settlement of the issue." 
  Qian pointed out that sanctions can not help solve the 
issue; 
on the contrary, sanctions may lead to results that none of the 
concerned parties is willing to see. 
  Han arrived here yesterday evening on a working visit.

  [Text] Beijing, 9 Jun (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- China's 
Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told ROK Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu this morning: China holds that two basic 
targets should be set for the settlement of the issue of North 
Korea's nuclear fuel, that is, promoting denuclearization in the 
Korean peninsula and safeguarding peace and stability there. 
China considers these two targets are in conformity with the 
fundamental interests of all countries in northeast Asia. 
  The Chinese and ROK foreign ministers held a working meeting 
here this morning. Han Sung-chu gave an account of the recent 
new developments of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
Qian Qichen expounded China's views on the current situation. 
  Thanks to efforts made by various parties, Qian Qichen said 
that the situation at the previous stage had developed in a 
positive direction. Because of differences between the 
International Atomic Energy Agency and the DPRK on inspections 
of the nuclear fuel rods, the situation had deteriorated. China 
is deeply concerned about the situation. 
  In the face of the current difficulties, Qian Qichen pointed 
out that the parties concerned should, in particular, keep calm 
and remain restrained and should not shut the door to 
negotiations. 
  Qian said that China had appealed to the parties concerned 
to 
continue to make efforts to restart talks to leave room for the 
possibility of a settlement of the issue. 
  Qian also pointed out that sanctions would not help solve 
the 
problem. On the contrary, they might lead to consequences which 
no one wished to see. 
  Han Sung-chu arrived in Beijing on the evening of 8 June for 
a working visit. He will leave for home on the afternoon of 9 
June.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Imposing Sanctions on DPRK Is Not a Good </F>
Method"] 
  [Text] Regarding the DPRK nuclear issue, Pyongyang has 
taken a tough attitude, rejecting the inspection of its key 
facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. 
However, the United States has reached a consensus with the ROK 
and Japan: Even if a resolution on imposing economic sanctions 
against the DPRK is not adopted by the UN Security Council, the 
United States, the ROK, and Japan will impose sanctions 
unilaterally. The United States has even asserted that it will 
go it alone in imposing sanctions at any cost if other countries 
are not willing to join in. 
  The ROK has held a supreme security conference, and has 
ordered its air, naval, and ground forces to be put on alert. 
According to Pyongyang, sanctions adopted by the UN Security 
Council will be tantamount to a "declaration of war," which will 
lead to inestimable consequences. 
  The United States, the ROK, and Japan all expect China to 
play an important role in the tense situation on the Korean 
peninsula, that is, to "persuade" Pyongyang to accept the IAEA 
inspections. Russia, which also has influence on the DPRK, is 
against economic sanctions and hopes that an international 
conference attended by the countries concerned can be held to 
resolve the problem through consultations. 
  Regarding China, its central leaders have told other 
countries not to place too much hope on China's influence on 
Pyongyang. China's basic position is that it supports the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and hopes that talks 
will be held to settle the question of the DPRK accepting 
international nuclear inspections arranged by the United Nations. 
  While meeting with a DPRK military delegation led by Chief 
of 
Staff Choe Kwang yesterday, President Jiang Zemin emphasized 
Sino-DPRK friendship and said that "the parties and armies of 
China and the DPRK share traditional friendly relations. 
Whether in the past or at present, it has been of great 
significance to further enhancing and developing such friendly 
ties." 
  The purpose of the DPRK military delegation's visit to China 
at a time when the situation on the peninsula is tense is to 
show the United States, the ROK, and other countries that 
Sino-DPRK relations, including military ties, are still good. 
Naturally, China and DPRK have maintained good neighborly 
relations for a long time. As neighbors, the continuity of 
their friendly ties benefits both sides. Jiang Zemin did not 
make any public statement on the DPRK nuclear question. 
Apparently, the situation on the Korean peninsula is still 
developing and changing. China is against compelling Pyongyang 
to give in. Even the question of nuclear inspections should be 
resolved through dialogue and consultations. Pressure will only 
aggravate and complicate the situation on the Korean peninsula. 
Russia is more or less inclined to China's position. 
  As a matter of fact, the international community should 
calmly evaluate whether the DPRK is capable economically, 
financially, or technologically to quickly produce an atomic 
bomb. At a time when the United States, Russia, and Ukraine are 
in deep trouble concerning the destruction and reduction of 
their nuclear warheads and rockets following the end of the Cold 
War, why should the DPRK, whose economic situation is very grim, 
develop an A-bomb? Would the people support it? 
  It seems that the United States has been a little too 
sensitive on the DPRK nuclear issue, which has also affected 
Japan and the ROK. However, they have neglected the popular 
will of the Korean peninsula, which tends toward reconciliation 
and the reunification of North and South Korea. 
  The facts and achievements attained by China since reform 
and 
opening up was introduced 15 years ago have exerted an influence 
on the DPRK, and Vietnam's open policy is also producing a good 
effect on the DPRK. A plan proposed by the United Nations to 
establish an international development zone in the Tumen Delta, 
which borders China, the DPRK, and Russia, in order to promote 
the economic development of all Northeast Asia was well received 
and supported by China, Japan, the ROK, Mongolia, the United 
States, and even Finland in northern Europe. The DPRK is also 
willing to turn its Chongjin and Rajin ports into open ports for 
the international development zone. This shows that the DPRK 
intends to open itself to the outside world. 
  From a long-term perspective, the Korean peninsula will be 
reunified. This is an irresistible historical trend. If, at 
this moment, one only knows how to step up pressure and impose 
sanctions at every turn, it will be difficult for a sovereign 
state to accept this. It is better to settle problems through 
dialogue and negotiations. As measures to isolate a country 
usually have the opposite results, they are not recommended. 
While meeting with the Maltese prime minister yesterday, Qian 
Qichen said that China maintains its position on the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. China hopes that the 
DPRK nuclear issue can be settled through talks held between the 
three sides and four parties. Sanctions are not good at 
resolving problems as they only intensify problems. 
  It is necessary for China to reconcile and mediate in the 
DPRK nuclear deadlock inside and outside the UN Security 
Council. The best option is to calmly analyze the causes of the 
problems on the Korean peninsula and to resolve these problems 
through patient and peaceful talks. 
  There is an ancient Chinese saying: "He who cannot forbear 
in 
small matters spoils great undertakings." In the face of the 
tense situation on the Korean peninsula today, the parties 
concerned should think further about China's proposal.

  [Text] Beijing, June 8 (XINHUA) -- Hu Jintao, member of 
the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist 
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, met here here this 
afternoon with Chu Song-il, president of the Central Committee 
of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, and his 
party. 
  During the meeting, Hu recalled his visit to the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) last July, saying that China 
and the DPRK are close, friendly neighbors, and that the 
traditional friendship between the two parties and countries has 
taken root among their peoples. 
  The Chinese party and government cherish the friendly 
cooperative relations between China and the DPRK, which has 
withstood the tests of time, Hu noted. 
  Under the current world situation, Hu said, consolidating 
and 
strengthening bilateral cooperation and friendship not only 
accords with the fundamental interests of two countries and the 
wills of the two peoples, but also is conducive to stability and 
peace in Asia and in the world at large. 
  Hu also briefed the DPRK visitors on China's reform, opening 
and modernization drive as well as Communist Party construction. 
  Ju expressed congratulations on China's achievements in its 
modernization drive. He said that strengthening exchanges and 
cooperation between his organization and the All-China 
Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) will promote the friendly 
relations between the DPRK and China and that such relations 
should be passed on from generation to generation. 
  The DPRK visitors arrived here yesterday as ACFTU guests.

  [Text] Moscow, June 1 (XINHUA) -- Russia withdrew the last 
three of its warships from Latvia today in accordance with a 
plan for troops withdrawal from the Baltic country. 
  The INTERFAX NEWS AGENCY reported that the three warships of 
the Russian Baltic Fleet left Liepaja Port of Latvia for 
Baltiysk Port in Russia. 
  Only a dozen Navy workers stayed behind to deal with 
remaining financial issues, INTERFAX said. 
  Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs said at a ceremony to 
mark the departure that Latvia and Russia are now embarking on a 
road of normal good-neighborly relations. 
  He said this can be proved by the Russian Navy's withdrawal 
today and Russia's granting of Latvia the most-favored-nation 
trade status, which has already taken effect. 
  In the wake of the Navy's pullout, the other services of the 
Russian Armed Forces will also complete their withdrawal by 
August 31.

of foreign trade and economic cooperation and Australian Trade 
Minister Bob McMullan. 
  Officials said that during the two-day forum held in

the forum. 
  The 147 letters of intent covered mainly on power stations,

  [Text] Sydney, June 9 (XINHUA) -- The China trade and 
investment forum held in Australia has borne fruitful results 
with letters of intent signed on 335 projects, valued at four 
billion U.S. dollars. 
  An official from the Chinese Ministry for Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation (MFTEC) described today the forum as 
"indicating the broad prospects for developing the 
Sino-Australian economic and trade ties." 
  The forum, ended in Sydney yesterday, was first held in 
Melbourne early this month and has altogether attracted 450 
people from the Australian business circles. 
  The forum, the largest ever held in Australia, was also 
attended by more than 100 businessmen from China's 20 provinces 
and cities, who have brought with them 519 projects, valued at 
seven billion U.S. dollars. 
  Commenting on the results of the forum, the MFTEC official 
told Chinese reporters today that the investment in China is on 
the upsurge in the Australian business circles. 
  That's because, he said, "the deepening of reforms in 
China's 
economic system and its rapid economic growth have created great 
opportunities for the Australian businesses." 
  The Chinese official also said that Australia, which has 
shifted its economic and trade focus towards Asia, is in a dire 
need of China's largest and most potential market in Asia. 
  He said that the two countries have seen a steady 
development 
of bilateral economic and trade ties in the past years thanks 
to the mutual complementarity of the two economies and the 
importance the Governments of China and Australia have attached 
to promoting the bilateral ties. 
  Official figures indicated that China has approved 1,310 
projects involving Australian investment by the end of last year 
and China has invested 130 projects in Australia. 
  The 335 projects singed at the forum mainly focus on 
communications, energy, petro-chemical industry, food processing 
industry, textile industry, building materials, agriculture and 
others. 
  China and Australia enjoyed a two-way trade of three billion 
U.S. dollars last year, representing an increase of 29 percent 
over the previous year, according to China's official figures.

<F P=106> [By reporters Qin Chun (4440 2504) and Zhang Jimin (1728 </F>
4949 3046)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 8 Jun (XINHUA) -- The seventh congress of 
academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [CAS] and the 
inaugural meeting of the Chinese Academy of Engineering closed 
here today. Song Jian, state councillor and minister of the 
State Science and Technology Commission, addressed the congress. 
On behalf of the State Council, he congratulated the 
academicians of the two academies for successfully accomplishing 
their missions. At the congress, prizes were presented to 
winners of the 1993 Chen Jiakeng Award. 
  Song Jiang said: The Eighth Five-Year Plan will successfully 
be fulfilled next year. This year, we have begun drafting the 
Ninth Five-Year Plan and the development program up to 2010. 
China's scientific and technological circles are preparing to 
enter the 21st century with a new appearance and new stance. We 
should formulate our Ninth Five-Year Plan for scientific and 
technological development on the basis of democracy, inherit and 
develop the fighting spirit of the Chinese scientific and 
technological circles and the great achievements they have 
scored over the past nearly half a century, and continue to work 
hard to meet the development target for the next century. 
  Song Jiang pointed out: We will continue to focus on the 
central task of economic construction, persist in reform and 
opening to the outside world, and more energetically implement 
the principle that economic construction must depend on science 
and technology and science and technology must be geared to 
economic construction. We must accomplish reform of the science 
and technology management system which has been undertaken for 
nine years, establish a science and technology management system 
and operation mechanism that meet the needs of a socialist 
market economy and conform to the law governing the development 
of science and technology, give full play to the role of science 
and technology as the primary productive force, and lay a solid 
foundation for building China into an economic, science, and 
technology power. This will be the basic task of the scientific 
and technological circles during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period. 
  Discussing the principle of "holding fast to one end and 
leaving the whole field open" for scientific and technological 
work, Song Jian said: In the days to come, we shall maintain 
and strengthen a contingent of competent scientists and 
technicians who shall engage in basic research and undertake the 
missions of high-tech research and development and the task of 
tackling major scientific and technological research that has a 
bearing on the national economy, the people's lives, and 
national defense. He said in any case, whether to hold fast to 
one end or leave the whole field open, scientific and 
technological departments must constantly try to raise their 
capacity to compete in the areas of research, experimentation, 
and market development, and work hard to move closer to or reach 
the advanced world level. 
  In conclusion, Song Jiang stressed: In the past four 
decades, China has made tremendous success in scientific and 
technological development, but the true upsurge has yet to come. 
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period, we should make 
preparations for the advent of the upsurge. We should train 
tens of thousands, or even millions, of young scientific and 
technological experts, further expand our contingents of 
scientists and technicians, strive to create conditions for 
their growth and their participation in the world scientific and 
technological arena, constantly heighten China's scientific and 
technological level, and make unremitting efforts to press on 
toward the forward position of science and technology. 
  At the congress, CAS President Zhou Guangzhao presented 
prizes to the seven winners of the 1993 Chen Jiakeng Award. 
They were Professor Wu Wenjun, winner of the Mathematical 
Science Award; Professor Tang Aoqing, winner of the Chemistry 
Award; Professor Zhu Zhaoliang, winner of the Agricultural 
Science Award; Professor Shi Yuanchun, winner of the 
Agricultural Science Award; Professor Wu Mengchao, winner of the 
Pharmaceutial Science Award; Professor Huang Jiqing, winner of 
the Geoscience Award; and Professor Zheng Zhemin, winner of the 
Technological Science Award.

  [Text] Beijing, June 8 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese science and 
technology community should make decisive contributions to a 
sustaining development of the national economy in the next 50 
years, said Song Jian, director of the State Science and 
Technology Commission. 
  Speaking at today's closing ceremony of the general meetings 
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the Chinese Academy 
of Engineering (CAE), Song said that the community should 
continue its efforts to help establish a scientific and 
democratic policy-making system. 
  In the main battlefield of the economic drive, all science 
and technology departments must do their part to help solve the 
problems which come up in the development of the country's 
industry, agriculture and the service industries, said Song, who 
is a state councillor. 
  "Such departments are also expected to help spread the use 
of 
new and advanced scientific results in order to raise the 
productivity of all industries and lead the rural and township 
enterprises onto a healthy development track and upgrade their 
technologies," he said. 
  He said that the country's science and technology sector 
must 
strive to develop environment-protection technology and develop 
as well as promote pollution-free production processes and 
methods so as to reduce and, eventually, halt the emission of 
pollutants. 
  "Scientists and technologists must contribute more to the 
protection of the environment on which people of all 
nationalities live and advance," the official noted. 
  To rule out possible mistakes in major policy-making, the 
whole process must involve the active participation of science 
and technology departments, Song said. 
  He said that the Chinese science and technology world must 
map out its ninth five-year plan and a 15-year development 
program on the basis of science and democracy. 
  The country's science and technology community should target 
some scientific and engineering projects that have a direct 
bearing on social and economic development. 
  He also said that China should train a large number of young 
scientists and engineers for the next century and set up 
well-equiped research institutions and key national labs. 
  From now on, the science and technology community should 
also 
reform itself so as to open wider to the outside world and 
expand international cooperation, Song said. 
  He urged the CAS and CAE, China's two top scientific bodies, 
to cooperate closely with each other while tapping their 
respective strengths. 
  "This will help develop the national economy and bolster the 
overall national strength," he said.

  [Text] China's top science and technology administrator has 
urged the country's newly-nominated academicians to actively 
involve themselves in the government's decisionmaking process. 
  Song Jian, State Councillor and Minister of the State 
Science 
and Technology Commission, made the request yesterday in Beijing 
at the closing session of the inaugural meeting of the 
newly-established Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE) and the 
seventh academician conference of the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences (CAS). 
  He asked the scholars of the two organizations to give more 
suggestions and advice for the drafting of the country's Ninth 
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and the 15-year plan that sets goals 
to 2010. 
  The plans are expected to be finished by the end of next 
year 
and be submitted for approval at the March session of the 
National People's Congress in 1996. 
  China's population will continuously expand during the next 
40 years to reach 1.6 billion to 1.7 billion, Song said. 
  Therefore, by the 2030's or 2040's, China's grain output 
needs to increase by 50 per cent just to ensure that the current 
modest supply remains level; electric energy production should 
expand 14-fold to reach the current per capita standard of 
moderately-developed countries; and all agricultural and 
industrial sectors and infrastructural facilities should be 
greatly expanded, he added. 
  China's modernization requires the constant efforts of all 
social sectors, especially science, for at least the next half 
century, he said. 
  Song stressed the importance of developing pollution-free 
production, reducing waste discharges, protecting the ecological 
balance, and establishing an environmental protection industry. 
  He also promised that the government will try its best to 
increase its investment in science and technology. 
  The total input from all social sectors in research and 
development should account for more than 1.5 per cent of the 
gross national product by the end of the century, instead of the 
current 0.7 per cent, he said. 
  At yesterday's session, the CAS also announced the 
appointment of its first group of foreign academicians. 
  The 14 foreign scientists include Derek Barton and Joseph 
Needham of Britain, and Peter Raven and Herbert Simon of the 
United States. 
  The others are all Chinese-American scientists, including 
the 
Nobel Prize winners Samuel Chao Chung Ting, Chen Ning Yang, and 
Tsungdao Lee.

and XINHUA reporter Luo Yuwen (5012 3768 2429)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 7 Jun (XINHUA) -- Liu Huaqing and Zhang 
Zhen, Central Military Commission vice chairman, held a forum 
yesterday afternoon with academicians of the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences [CAS] and the Chinese Academy of Engineering [CAE] 
working in the Armed Forces. The forum was held to discuss 
major programs for the Armed Forces' modernization. Chi 
Haotian, Zhang Wannian, Yu Yongbo, and Fu Quanyou, Central 
Military Commission members, also attended the forum. 
  According to a briefing, 20 academicians of the CAS and the 
CAE now work in medical care, public health, scientific 
research, higher education, engineering, technical, and the 
Armed Forces' departments. They included Qian Xuesen and Zhu 
Guangya, world-famous scientists. They have won twelve 
special-class state awards for scientific and technological 
progress, special-class awards for scientific and technological 
results in national defense, and state awards for major 
scientific and technological results; 21 first- and second-class 
state awards and first-class military awards for scientific and 
technological progress; and 10 merit citations, first or second 
class. Sixteen of them have been issued special subsidies by 
the government, and three have been rated young and middle-aged 
experts with outstanding contributions. 
  At the forum, Zhu Guangya, Wu Mengchao, Wang Chengwei, Zhang 
Xiaoxiang, Chen Fangyun, Zhou Tingchong, Qian Qihu, Sun Manji, 
Zhou Xingming, Cheng Kaijia, Wang Yongzhi, and other 
academicians stated their views on developing science and 
technology for national defense, strengthening the training of 
qualified personnel in advanced science and high technology, 
attaching importance to scientific and technological exchanges, 
organizing personnel to tackle difficult scientific and 
technological problems through coordinated efforts, and further 
arousing the enthusiasm of scientists and technologists. 
  Liu Huaqing made a speech after listening to academicians' 
opinions. On behalf of the Central Military Commission, he 
extended warm congratulations to the academicians of the two 
academies as well as high respects to large numbers of 
scientists, technologists, and engineers who had made 
outstanding contributions to the development of science and 
technology for national defense and the Armed Forces' 
modernization. He called for various departments to 
conscientiously step up research and continue to improve their 
work. 
  Liu Huaqing said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that 
science and technology constitute a primary productive force. 
The Armed Forces' modernization cannot be accomplished without 
science and technology. It is a long-term, arduous task to 
develop science and technology for national defense. Large 
numbers of scientists, technologists, and engineers are charged 
with important tasks. We should further arouse their 
enthusiasm, train high-level personnel, have our eyes on the 
future, and coordinate and concentrate our efforts on 
continuously achieving results in modern science and technology. 
  Liu Huaqing hoped that scientists and technologists working 
in the Armed Forces would strengthen their contacts with their 
counterparts at home and abroad, do a better job in academic 
exchanges, learn from others' strong points to offset their 
weaknesses, and improve themselves and that they would, under 
the Central Military Commission's leadership with Comrade Jiang 
Zemin as the core, unite as one and work in a pioneering spirit 
to contribute more to the national defense's modernization. 
  Central Military Committee leaders had group pictures taken 
with academicians of the two academies and also had supper with 
them.

  [Text] Beijing, June 8 (XINHUA) -- Fourteen foreign 
scientists, including five Nobel Prize laureates, have been 
elected as the first foreign academicians of the Chinese Academy 
of Sciences (CAS) today at a general meeting of CAS. 
  Among them two are citizens of Britain and the other 12 
citizens of the United States. 
  The new inductees are: Derek Barton and Joseph Needham of 
Britain, L.L. Chang, S.S. Chern, Y.C. Fung, T.D. Lee, C.C. Lin, 
Peter Raven, Herbert Simon, C.L. Tien, S.C.C. Ting, C.S. Wu, 
C.N. Yang and S.T. Yau of the United States. 
  The five Nobel Prize laureates are 1957 physics prize 
co-winners T.D. Lee and C.N. Yang, 1969 chemistry prize winner 
Derek Barton, 1976 physics prize winner S.C.C. Ting and 1978 
economics prize winner Herbert Simon. 
  The election of the first CAS foreign academicians, CAS 
President Zhou Guangzhao said, signals that China's science and 
technology community is opening ever wider to the outside world. 
  Scientific activities belong to the whole world, as they are 
very international and have no boundaries. The foreign CAS 
academicians all have enjoyed high academic reputations and 
contributed greatly to the advancement of China's science and 
technology, he noted. 
  He added that their election to CAS is a proud moment for 
the 
scientific body and will be conducive to China's scientific and 
technological development as well as a stimulus to pump new 
vigor into CAS. 
  Zhou said that China, a country with a long history, once 
enjoyed glory in its scientific and technological development. 
The testing and weathering of contemporary times have brought 
China's science and technology into the international arena. 
  "This will add glories to the already prestigious academic 
careers of the foreign academicians of CAS," he said. 
  All the foreign academicians are scientists active on the 
most advanced frontiers of world science and technology, said 
Zhou, adding that CAS should actively do its part to keep them 
well connected with and well informed of CAS activities as well 
as hear their opinions so as to accelerate the 
internationalization process of China's science and technology. 
  Song Jian, director of the State Science Commission, said 
that the election of the first group of CAS foreign academicians 
symbolizes China's efforts to open wider to the outside world 
and enhance international cooperation in science and technology. 
  During the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), the Chinese 
scientific and technological community should take full 
advantage of the favorable domestic and world environment 
created by the country's reform and opening policies to open 
even wider and expand international academic cooperation, he 
said. 
  The community should keep refreshing its banks of knowledge, 
absorbing new information and picking up new energy so as to 
step up the development of China's science and technology, Song 
said.

  [Text] Beijing, June 8 (CNS) -- Renowned Chinese expert in 
the telecommunication and Vice Minister of Posts and 
Telecommunications, Mr. Zhu Gaofeng, who was newly elected Vice 
President of the Chinese Academy of Engineering Sciences (CAES) 
expressed in an interview with this agency at the meeting 
attended by academicians of the CAES held here yesterday that 
after its establishment, the CAES would begin to do some 
practical work including the offering of 
engineering-technology-related advisers and suggestions to the 
government for its decision-making in drawing up the Ninth 
Five-Year Plan. 
  The CAES is the highest academic body in engineering field 
in 
the country. On June 9, relevant leaders of the State Council 
briefed academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the 
CAES on ideas for the Ninth Five-Year Plan and Scientific and 
technological development programme within this period in the 
country. Academicians of the CAES will discuss and work out 
proposals of the strategy for the development of science and 
technology and the developmental goals in different stages in 
the future. [as received] 
  As an expert in post and telecommunications, Mr. Zhu has 
made 
a great contribution in this field and since 1982, he has been 
the Vice Minister of Posts and Telecommunications. 
  Mr. Zhu said that another work needed to be done by the CAES 
was to enlarge its academician ranks. He rebuked the concept 
prevailing in the past that the social status of the engineering 
technicians should be lower than that of scientists, saying that 
from a long-term social and economic point of view, this idea 
was harmful. One of the aims for the establishment of the CAES 
was to raise the status of engineering technicians, therefore, 
those who have become leading academic personnel and made 
outstanding contributions in this field would be drawn into the 
academician ranks as soon as possible. China now has nearly 10 
million engineering technicians.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "A Gathering of Talents, Prosperous </F>
Scientific and Technological Undertakings--Warm Congratulations 
on Inauguration of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and 
Opening of the Seventh Academicians Conference of the Chinese 
Academy of Sciences"] 
  [Text] The Chinese Academy of Engineering [CAE] was 
officially inaugurated on 3 June at the opening of the seventh 
academicians conference of the Chinese Academy of Sciences 
[CAS]. This is an event for celebrating. 
  The founding of the CAE is a grand event in China 
engineering 
circles. Engineering is the summary of the great practice of 
mankind's application of scientific theories to transform, 
utilize, and protect nature. Over the past 50 years or so, the 
pace and scale of growth of engineering has been unprecedented, 
which, in turn, is an immense direct motive force pushing the 
economy forward. It has increasingly attracted attention of 
science and technology circles and policy decisionmakers of all 
countries. Over the decades, the broad ranks of engineering 
personnel have exerted their utmost efforts and scored marked 
successes in economic development and national defense 
construction. They have built a large number of key projects 
and basic facilities which developed as unique advantages in 
certain fields and enhanced the pride and unity of the Chinese 
nation. The founding of the CAE and election of a number of 
outstanding engineering experts who have made major and creative 
contributions as academicians will enormously encourage the 
broad ranks of engineering personnel and exert a positive, 
far-reaching influence on China's science, technology, and 
economic construction. 
  Since its founding in 1955, CAS has rallied the nationally 
acknowledged best scientists, who play an irreplaceable role in 
laying down the country's major science and techology policy 
decisions and certain economic and social development 
strategies. The conference of academicians is the first of its 
kind since the title of academy member has been changed to 
academician in light of international practice. The first group 
of foreign academicians at CAS will be elected at the 
conference. This is one of the signs indicating that China's 
science and technology circles have opened their door wider to 
the outside world and have stepped on the stage of world 
science, which will play an important role in promoting 
international scientific and technological cooperation and 
exchanges and pushing forward China's scientific and 
technological development. 
  Academician of the CAE and CAS is the highest academic title 
in China's science, technology, and engineering circles. These 
academicians are outstanding representatives of the 17 million 
scientific workers and engineers. Among the academicians of the 
two academies, there are masters of great learning and integrity 
of the elder generation as well as young talented people who 
have made outstanding contributions in their respective fields. 
The gathering of talents at the conference of the two academies 
manifests the prosperity of China's science and engineering 
cause. 
  The reform of China's science and technology system is now 
developing in depth. Reform means emancipation of productive 
forces and, above all, rapidly developing science and 
technology, and swiftly converting it into real productive 
forces through all sorts of engineering. In the course of 
deepened reform, it is necessary to correctly handle relations 
between our own innovation and importing advanced technology and 
between science and technology and the economy, dialectically 
unite the two, and bring about a sustained, rapid, and healthy 
growth of China's economy. We should invigorate work which 
directly serves economic construction and concentrate picked 
forces to stabilize and support work which represents the 
Chinese nation in competing on the international stage of 
science. It is necessary to stress a sense and spirit of 
innovation in whatever work we do. Only in this way can we 
catch up with the advanced and gain a foothold in the sharp 
international competition. We hope that the academicians of the 
CAS and CAE will unite, guide the science and technology workers 
of the whole nation, and make new contributions to the 
revitalization of the Chinese nation.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Lu Mu (7627 3668) from the "In-Depth </F>
Discussion on Chinese Economic Efficiency" Column: "A Study on 
Investment Benefits"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 8 Jun (XINHUA) -- Over the last 40 years 
up to 1993, China spent several hundred billion yuan in fixed 
asset investment. During those years, China started up more 
than 10,000 large and medium-sized basic construction projects, 
of which 5,000 were completed and put into operation. What 
about their economic efficiency? To prepare this article, I 
discussed the problem with many management personnel and 
investment experts. They all said it would be very difficult to 
explain the problem in a few words. 
  Experts divided the economic benefits of fixed asset 
investment into projected benefits, construction benefits, and 
final benefits. Projected benefits refer to a process through 
which experts check the possibility of the success of an 
investment project from the stage of decisionmaking, design, 
completion, and commissioning of the said investment project. 
To determine construction benefits, one needs to check the 
extent of cost-saving (quality included) during construction of 
the investment project, as there is only input and no output 
during the construction period. Final benefits are the most 
important, because investment results are finally reflected in 
economic benefits following the commissioning of a project. 
Investment results are also reflected in whether the invested 
amount can be recouped ahead of schedule or on schedule and by 
the increase in the value of capital. 
  Based on the division of projected, construction, and final 
benefits, and as far as the state's major and medium-sized 
projects are concerned, we can say that most of the decisions on 
building these projects were correct; construction of most of 
them was successful; their projected benefits were good or 
excellent; and they have played a positive role in the 
development of China's economy. Among them was the "156" 
project which was carried out many years ago under the First 
Five-Year Plan. Among recent cases were a number of state key 
projects including the Baoshan Iron and Steel Complex, Gezhou 
Dam, Beijing-Guangzhou Double-Track Railway, 
Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu Expressway, and Yangpu Bridge. Not only 
were their projected benefits good, but their construction and 
final benefits were also satisfactory. 
  However, wrong decisions and poor construction planning 
indeed contributed to many failed projects. Heavy losses begin 
with the completion of flawed projects. In one case, a newly 
built port was unable to handle oil because none was available. 
The result: The port was left idle most of the time. In 
another case, some railways were built to transport local coal, 
but as none was available by the time they were completed, 
additional railways had to be constructed to transport other 
provinces' coal. One locality spent $36 million on importing a 
set of equipment to produce methyl alcohol; but, because of the 
excess local production capacity for methyl alcohol and because 
there was no buyer for this equipment, it was left idle and 
became a heap of scrap metal. 
  Regarding construction benefits, there were cases of cost 
overruns -- I am not talking about a 10 or 20 percent cost 
overrun but overruns of 100-200 percent. There were also many 
cases of behind-schedule and poor-quality projects. Due to 
various reasons, the final benefits of many projects were poor. 
This resulted in a failure to repay investment loans and the 
inability to recoup the investment amount. What are the reasons 
behind poor economic benefits? 
  "This is a complex and long-standing problem," remarked one 
person involved in investment planning. He said the problems 
behind poor economic benefits for some investment projects are 
not new; they are age-old problems which have been discussed 
again and again. They include: The scrambling to set up 
investment projects; "feasibility reports" which tend to become 
"approval reports;" disregard for project appraisal 
consultation; failure to follow the procedures governing basic 
construction projects; and bid rigging. Some investment experts 
added the following reasons: Flip-flop decisions on investment 
projects; emphasis on extensive forms of enlarged production; 
negligence of intensive forms of enlarged production; 
concentration on oversupplied goods production to the neglect of 
production of goods in short supply; emphasis on small-scale 
projects to the neglect of large-scale projects; overhastiness 
in starting up projects; and the tendency to go slow on start-up 
projects. 
  We have to admit that a micro-investment project tends to be 
affected and restrained by the macroeconomic environment. 
"Fondness for big projects" and "excessive investment" are the 
direct reasons that cause poor economic benefits for some 
investment projects. 
  What are the adverse effects of the excessive investment 
scale? 
  When many construction projects are plagued with the problem 
of fund supply, the state is forced to issue inordinate amounts 
of money on the market. Even if the state issues a large amount 
of money on the market, there is no certainty that it can meet 
the fund requirements of many construction projects. If funds 
are unavailable, the progress of the project will be affected, 
completion will be delayed, and construction benefits will be 
adversely affected. 
  Fixed asset investment not only requires funds but also 
materials. An overly extended investment scale will lead to 
steel, cement, and glass shortages. When all rush to buy up 
materials, prices will surely rise, which will then trigger 
inflation. 
  There is an objective law behind the scale of investment 
which does not change with changes in the people's will. The 
objective law dictates that construction scale be commensurate 
with national strength. Every year, a country may only draw a 
portion from the GDP or from the national income to invest in 
fixed assets that will not produce output within a short period. 
How big should this portion be? That depends on the 
availability of the funds at the time. All in all, when the 
investment rate climbs up to a certain degree, it is bound to 
fall to seek a balance in supply and demand. Otherwise, national 
economic development will be affected. Therefore, maintaining a 
proper investment rate, extending the cycle of fluctuation as 
long as possible, reducing the fluctuation rate, and avoiding 
"flip-flops," are the keys to raising investment benefits, and 
to bringing about a sustained and healthy development of the 
national economy. 
  Some experts of the State Statistical Bureau believe that 
the proper annual investment rate for China is between 30 and 32 
percent. A researcher of the Economics Research Center of the 
State Planning Commission has said practice since the start of 
reform and opening up shows that strains and even imbalance will 
happen in various sectors of the national economy if the annual 
investment rate exceeds 30 percent and the investment rate of 
state-owned units exceeds 20 percent. 
  The construction of projects is separated from their 
productive operations, and the investment management system 
deals with the former only. As a result, people seek only to 
have a project approved, built, and completed, and they do not 
care about final benefits. This is another direct cause for 
poor economic efficiency of some investment projects. 
  Under the "one-continuous-line" investment management system 
over the last several dozen years, the management of an 
investment project, particularly a state investment project, 
ends after it is checked and accepted upon completion. A 
leading group is responsible for the preparation, designing, 
engineering, and completion of a major project (large or 
medium-sized); and then, another leading group will be in charge 
of its productive operation. 
  Such an investment management system, known as the "project 
before enterprise" system, objectively separates project 
construction from its productive operation, while the two should 
be integrated as one. All the shortcomings of such a practice 
have been shown today. Because of the separation, the project 
designers and builders usually do not consider the needs of 
enterprise production and operation. When the enterprise 
manager encounters a problem, he usually uses "inherent 
shortcomings" as an excuse to shirk his responsibility. 
Something unusual happens in connection with investment -- for 
a construction project which costs more than 50 million yuan, 
the budget is projected at only 49.9 million yuan so that it 
will be easier to get approval; and after it is approved and 
construction starts, people's enthusiasm drastically cools down 
and they do not care about its progress at all. Some people 
think that what is important is to get the project approved and 
the funds appropriated; after all, only the state is affected by 
profit or loss. 
  These phenomena show that the old investment management 
system objectively separates anticipated benefits from 
engineering efficiency and final benefits, and seriously ignores 
the pursuit of final benefits and other objectives.

  [Text] Beijing, June 9 (XINHUA) -- Today's economic news in 
brief. 
<H5>  Guilin Attracts More Overseas Investment </H5>
  Guilin, a city known for its superb landscape in Guangxi 
Zhuang autonomous region, boasts 385 overseas-funded 
enterprises, 200 of which are industrial projects. The city's 
overseas investment has broadened from solely service industry 
to such industrial sectors as electronics, machinery, food 
processing and handicrafts. 
<H5>  Technological Activities Draw Guangzhou Residents </H5>
  Residents in Guangzhou, capital city of Guangdong Province, 
are very active in studying new technology as 610 such 
organizations have been established in the city, drawing over 
80,000 people to learn and exchange skills. This activity has 
paid off as development results turned out in these 
organizations produced 150 million yuan in economic returns last 
year. 
<H5>  Farmers Keen on Ecological Farming </H5>
  About 20,000 ethnic farmers in Gongcheng Yao Autonomous 
County have benefited from ecological farming as their per 
capita grain output and net income have both registered 
noticeable growth. Farmers here are planting trees and 
introducing solar energy to neighboring villages to improve the 
county's ecological structure.

  [Text] Guiyang, June 9 (XINHUA) -- China will invest 1 
billion yuan in highway projects in 21 provinces and autonomous 
regions in central and western China. 
  The funds will be issued as payments instead of relief funds 
to farmers for their work on highway construction projects in 
poverty-stricken areas. 
  Yang Zhong, deputy director of the leading group of the 
aid-the-poor projects under the State Council, recently noted at 
a conference in Guiyang that it is one of the measures taken by 
the central government to help improve communications conditions 
in poverty-stricken areas. 
  Since 1985, the departments of communications in the related 
provinces and autonomous regions have constructed about 150,000 
kilometers of highways in rural areas, including roads for farm 
machines. 
  The highways link more than 1,500 towns and 10,000 villages. 
  According to Yang, now there are still 1,700 townships and 
more than 17,000 villages in China which have no access to 
highways. 
  He said that most of the villages and townships are in the 
poverty-stricken regions in the central and western parts of the 
country. 
  He said that the construction of highways should be placed 
at 
the top of the economic development agenda in poverty-stricken 
regions. Such projects are expected to promote the growth of the 
market economy and break the isolation of the regions.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Firms Put More Faith in Arbiters"] </F>
  [Text] Officials expect China to remain the world's largest 
commercial arbitration centre, indicating that foreign firms 
have a growing reliance on Chinese mediators. 
  More than 250 cases flooded the China International Economic 
and Trade Arbitration Commission (Cietac) by the end of May. 
Cietac predicts it will handle nearly 600 cases before the year 
is out. 
  Cietac handled 486 cases last year more than any other 
international centre. 
  "More and more Chinese and foreign companies are willing to 
resort to Cietac for settling their business disputes," said Zhu 
Jianlin, deputy secretary general of Cietac, at a briefing for 
the upcoming International Commercial Arbitration Legislation 
Conference. 
  The conference, to be held in Beijing on June 22 and 23, 
should further link China's business arbitration with 
international standards. 
  Decisions made in China are now honoured and enforced in 
more 
than 90 countries and regions. 
  In the past, many foreigners fled to other international 
arbitrators whenever disputes arose about things like wording in 
joint-venture contracts or poor shipments of materials. 
  Now the world is focusing on particular Chinese mediation 
practices because of its increasing importance in international 
commercial arbitration. 
  China has successfully combined arbitration with its 
traditional thinking of mediation. 
  Chinese arbitrators help the disputing parties come to 
mutual 
agreement and reconciliation, easing tensions rather than 
furthering the anger. 
  But in many nations, arbitrators must decide who wins and 
who 
loses, no matter how furious a party might be. 
  The international conference will provide the foreign 
experts 
with a perfect perch for examining the Chinese experience. 
  More than 300 Chinese and foreign arbitration and trade 
experts will attend the conference, the first of its kind in 
China and the entire Asia-Pacific region. 
  China hopes the event will help its re-entry into the 
General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt); other parts of the world 
will see at first hand the progress China has made toward 
meeting international norms in economic activities. 
  The conference is being organized by Cietac and the 
International Council of Commercial Arbitration.

<F P=106> [Article by Willy Wo-lap Lam from the "Analysis" page: </F>
"Superman Zhu Goes Back to the Future"] 
  [Text] Very strange things are happening to China's 
economic policy. First we have Zhu Rongji's statement last 
weekend that everything was shipshape: according to the script 
of the czar-turned-superman, the growth and inflation rates will 
both be contained within 10 per cent this year. 
  Then comes the intriguing article in Monday's edition of the 
pro-Beijing Hong Kong daily, WEN WEI PO, that the Communist 
Party's Central Committee would later this year hold a fourth 
plenum to in effect rectify the pro-market resolution of the 
third plenum of just six months ago. 
  A dialectical materialist, particularly a reformist one such 
as Deng Xiaoping, would spot this contradiction: if everything 
in the economy is in order, as Mr Zhu claims, it's time for 
another leap forward in reform, not retrenchment, which seems to 
be the theme of the fourth plenum. 
  Let us first examine the feel-good campaign that Mr Zhu and 
his cohorts, including senior cadres in the State Economic and 
Trade Commission (SETC) and the People's Bank of China (PBoC), 
have waged since the spring. 
  While visiting Tokyo in March Japan's favourite Chinese 
politician waxed eloquent about the success of China's price 
reform. "Price reforms are necessary to shift towards a market 
economy," Mr Zhu said. "Once price reforms are in place, 
inflation should fall to around 10 per cent this year and six 
per cent next year." He made even more sweeping assertions in 
his meeting with a Hong Kong business delegation last week. The 
vice-premier contended that state-owned enterprises had turned 
the corner: profit levels of the dinosaurs leaped 40 per cent 
in the first four months of the year. 
  SETC minister Wang Zhongyu Mr Zhu's troubleshooter, 
astonished domestic and foreign economists by maintaining twice 
recently that barely 10 per cent of China's state enterprises 
had either stopped operations or were operating below capacity. 
"If we analyse the situation with a practical mind, we will 
discover that these (state-owned) enterprises are developing in 
the right direction," he told an economic planning conference 
late last month. 
  No less audacious was the claim by Mr Zhu's deputy at the 
PBoC, Zhou Zhengqing, that "the reform of China's monetary and 
financial system has been going on smoothly". This series of 
morale-boosters does not seem to square with the facts. Let's 
turn first to inflation, the scourge of the nation. 
  There is no solid evidence to show that the spirals have 
been 
depressed. The latest statistics show the year-on-year increase 
in the national retail prices for April was 21.7 per cent, which 
was only down a mere 0.7 percentage points from the comparable 
figure for March. 
  Meanwhile, fixed-asset investment, a major contributor to 
inflation, is tipped to exceed the government-fixed ceiling of 
1,300 billion yuan by 15 per cent this year, which was itself 13 
per cent more than the 1993 figure. By May, such outlays by 14 
major provinces and cities had overshot the state limit by 60 
billion yuan. 
  The claims by Mr Zhu and Mr Wang about state enterprises 
going in the "right direction" contradict scores of reports by 
government statisticians, the official media, and Western 
diplomats and businessmen that the government-owned sector is 
mired in distress. 
  In an unusually frank dispatch last week, the semi-official 
China News Service reported that while addressing the economic 
conclave, Mr Wang was confronted with official figures showing 
that losses incurred by state firms had increased by 80 per cent 
and that at least 45 per cent of them were dripping in red ink. 
  All that the SETC minister said was: "This is a 
misunderstanding." 
  Western financiers have cast doubt on Mr Zhou's contention 
about the success of monetary reform, the main thrust of which 
is to depoliticise the banking system by predicating credit 
policy on economic norms, not executive orders. 
  However, as senior economist Dong Fureng said last month, a 
major factor holding back the commercialisation of banking is 
that up to 40 per cent of loans are tied up by so-called 
"triangular debts". In fact, it was Mr Zhu who, as PBoC 
governor, gave personal orders early last month to prop up the 
anaemic dinosaurs. 
  Apparently oblivious of the anti-inflation campaign, the 
czar 
asked bankers to continue lending to money-losing concerns -- 
"provided the funds are being used for the production of goods 
that can be sold". 
  Largely taking the cue from Beijing, the banks boosted loans 
by 75 billion yuan in the first four months of the year. The 
big question: why the concerted effort to paint a rosy picture? 
  One explanation is that to better position themselves for 
the 
post-Deng power struggle, Mr Zhu and his followers cannot afford 
to come across as losers. The second reason is also political. 
The central government cannot withstand pressure from two of 
the potentially most destabilising forces in society: state 
entrepreneurs and the unemployed. 
  By giving the impression that inflation is coming down and 
state enterprises are on the mend, Mr Zhu hopes he can defend 
his anti-market policy of lifting the tight-money regime in 
favour of the country's least efficient sector. That the 
economy is not under control is evident from the disturbing 
measures being taken to "boost macro-level adjustments and 
controls". 
  Conspiracy theorists have already termed the forthcoming 
fourth plenum as an anti-Deng schema. As the Wen Wei Po put it, 
"The third plenum of the 14th Central Committee posited a 
structural framework for a socialist market economy. What the 
fourth plenum needs to tackle is new management problems for 
such a new framework." Translation: the pro-market initiatives 
of the third plenum, which bore Mr Deng's imprimatur, need to be 
contained by the proverbial bird cage of centralised control. 
  Didn't the propagandists hail the third plenum's 
15,000-character Resolution on the Socialist Market Economy as 
the Magna Carta for liberalisation? Analysts say it is rare for 
even a Communist Party to practise such radical revisionism so 
soon after the fact. 
  Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua confirmed the conservative twist in 
policy when he indicated on Friday [3 June] that price reform, 
about which Mr Zhu boasted so wholeheartedly in Tokyo, would on 
a de facto basis be put on hold. Speaking somewhat 
contradictorily, Mr Zou pointed out that "there will be (state) 
control of prices in the midst of opening them up". 
  The fear among China economists, however, is if Beijing's 
lily-livered efforts at market reforms fail to accomplish what 
Mr Zhu has claimed, neither will a return to the 
tried-and-untrue formulae of the past.

<F P=106> [From "Chinese Economic News" column] </F>
  [Text] A few days ago, the Civil Aviation Administration 
of China [CAAC] and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation jointly issued a circular stating that, in the 
future, foreign businesses will be conditionally allowed to 
engage in investment in and operation of the civil aviation 
industry in China in line with the principle of placing state 
investment in a dominant position. 
  According to the circular, it is stipulated that foreign 
businesses are allowed to invest in the construction of airports 
for civil purposes, including runways, taxi-ways, and parking 
aprons. In these jointly-funded projects, more than 51 percent 
of the authorized capital must be controlled by the Chinese 
side, and such posts as chairmen of the boards of directors and 
general managers must be taken up by Chinese personnel. 
  The circular states that foreign enterprises engaging in the 
investment of airport flight area may, subject to approval, 
expand their scope of operation appropriately to include 
terminal buildings, cargo warehouses, ground services, aircraft 
maintenance, hotels, restaurants, food and fuel supplies, and 
other supporting projects of the airports. The air traffic 
control system, however, will still be monopolized by the state, 
and foreign investors are not allowed to be involved in either 
investment or operation. 
  The joint investment by foreign businesses and Chinese 
aviation and transportation enterprises will be conducted by 
setting up Sino-foreign aviation and transportation enterprises 
in the form of joint ventures or cooperative entities. Foreign 
businesses may also buy shares of Chinese enterprises 
specializing in air shipment, or both sides may hold shares 
reciprocally. In these enterprises, shares held by foreigners 
should not exceed 35 percent of the authorized capital, and the 
rights of voting held by their representatives in the boards of 
directors should not exceed 25 percent. 
  Apart from the stipulation that chairmanships of boards of 
directors and general managers are to be assumed by the Chinese 
side, other members of the management at and below deputy 
general manager level may, if necessary, be selected and 
appointed by the general managers. In terms of taxation, 
foreign-funded enterprises will enjoy the same treatment as 
similar domestic enterprises. 
  Foreign airport authorities and aviation manufacturers are 
not permitted to set up aviation and transportation enterprises 
in China. Foreign investors planning to set up joint-funded 
aviation enterprises should obtain approval from CAAC first, 
which should be further examined and approved by relevant state 
departments. The operating activities of these enterprises 
should be put under control and supervision of CAAC and other 
administrative bodies of various regions.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Civil Aviation Administration of China Ready </F>
To Jointly Operate Airlines With Foreign Investment"] 
  [Text] The Civil Aviation Administration of China [CAAC] 
is ready to cooperate with foreign investors, on a trial basis, 
in jointly running and developing domestic and international 
flights. If the undertaking of Sino-foreign cooperative civil 
aviation is successful, the civil aviation market will be opened 
up further. 
  This message came from a high-ranking official from CAAC in 
Beijing and should be described as one of the effective channels 
for the modernization of China's civil aviation. It is an 
undeniable fact that China's civil aviation has been developing 
very quickly since China started opening up, but many drawbacks 
also exist. By practically cooperating with foreign investors, 
the virtues can be brought into play to make up for defects, 
which will be beneficial to both the Chinese and the foreign 
sides in the cooperation. 
  The undertaking of civil aviation has been monopolized by 
the 
state since New China's founding, thus forming a "unifying 
situation" encompassing investment, construction, and 
management. The greatest weakness of this practice is that 
everything relies on the state and that improvement is 
neglected. The contingent of aviators and air crew are mainly 
cadres transferred from the Air Force after strict political 
inspection, thus inevitably paying too much attention to this 
but setting no demand on the business. We must bear in mind 
that modern civil administration is closely bound up with high 
technology. High-precision computers, sophisticated meters, and 
an increasingly high degree of automation must all be put under 
human control. For example, new types of aircraft with a high 
degree of technology, such as Boeing-777, Euro Airbus A-300 and 
A-301, must be piloted by high-caliber aviators. In order to 
develop modern civil aviation, China cannot but introduce 
various new types of aircraft and hugely upgrade the overall 
quality of pilots and set a much higher demand on technology, 
otherwise problems will easily arise. Not long ago, a Taiwan 
airbus "A300-600R" crashed in Nagoya and caused more than 200 
casualties, and the tragedy was, as far as we now know, 
precisely caused by pilot and co-pilot negligence. Normally 
speaking, "China Airlines" has a longer history, but many 
instances of "dangerous situations" unavoidably arose when its 
aviators piloted new types of aircraft. They also admitted that 
the quality and administration of pilots must be improved. 
Hence, as far as the training of aviators is concerned, the 
CAAC must exchange with advanced countries more frequently, and 
jointly running the business is precisely a realistic and 
feasible way. The situation is the same in aircraft maintenance. 
  Another criticism of CAAC is that its service conditions are 
quite poor, in particular, its planes often take off behind 
schedule. Of course, this relates to such factors as the growth 
of air routes, frequent flights, inadequate airport facilities, 
and difficulties in aircraft transfer. Consequently, although 
the crux of the problem has been clearly known for years, 
improvement is slow. Under such circumstances, cooperating with 
foreign advanced airlines on an trial basis and assimilating 
their management skills in practice can make up China's own 
deficiencies. 
  It is not the first time that the CAAC has cooperated with 
foreign investors. For example, the supply of air food is 
precisely this kind of cooperation with Hong Kong's catering 
business, whereas joint maintenance is another type of 
cooperation with Hong Kong enterprises engaging in aircraft 
engineering projects. This time, the stress will be laid on 
such key aspects as management and administration, which is an 
important step. 
  CAAC is ready to cooperate with foreign investors, but there 
are also some preconditions. That is, under the principle of 
mainly relying on Chinese investment, foreign businesses can 
conditionally invest in or run the business of China's civil 
aviation, including the construction of civil airports and 
tarmacs (including runways and parking aprons) in China in such 
forms as joint ventures or joint operations. When cooperating 
with foreign investors, the Chinese side must invest over 51 
percent of capital in the projects and assign personnel to take 
up the posts of chairmen of the board of directors and general 
managers. Foreign businessmen granted the right to run the 
above-mentioned joint-venture projects are welcome to invest in 
and run civil aviation service projects in such aspects as 
airport terminals, freight transport depositories, land service, 
air food, guesthouses, restaurants, and aviation fuel. All 
these are attractive targets of investment. 
  China also said that foreign businessmen are welcome to 
invest in aviation enterprises engaging in agriculture and 
forestry, in the form of joint venture or joint operation. The 
proportion of foreign investment in this respect can be decided 
through consultation. 
  However, the air traffic control system must still be 
financed and administered by China; whereas foreign airport and 
aircraft construction enterprises cannot invest in and set up 
air transport enterprises. 
  It clearly indicates that foreign enterprises cannot take 
part in areas which have a bearing on state sovereignty and 
security, but they can cooperate with the Chinese side or set up 
joint ventures in all other areas. For example, foreign 
investors have become stockholders of Sanya Airport in Hainan 
Province. 
  At present, the global civil aviation business is in a state 
of recession, and most foreign airlines are interested to 
develop their business in China. Now is the golden opportunity 
for CAAC to develop and expand further and to march to the 
international market.

<F P=106> [From the "Current Affairs" program] </F>
  [Text] China's national offshore oil corporation will go 
abroad to seek potential cooperators later this month. The 
partners will explore for oil and natural gas in the South China 
Sea. Li Peichun has the story: 
  [Begin recording] [Li Peichun] The China National Offshore 
Oil Corporation or CNOOC will open up a total of 13 blocks for 
foreign exploration. All of them are located near coastal areas 
of the South China Sea. The Chinese company will send a 
delegation to Houston, Texas in the United States to seek 
exploration partners. The program was first announced in early 
May. By 1 June, more than 10 U.S. oil companies had expressed 
interest in bidding for the project. Arco, Unical, Chevron, and 
(Namical) are the largest U.S. oil firms who want a piece of the 
action. CNOOC says more than 60 companies will take part in the 
bidding in Houston. Senior geologist (Gong Zaisheng) is leading 
the Houston delegation. He said he is sure that bidding will be 
a success because all of the blocks are rich areas. 
  [Gong speaking in Mandarin fading into English translation] 
(Gong Zaisheng) says seven of the areas are rich in natural gas 
before this. China originally reserved the areas for 
independent exploration, but due to the lack of funds and the 
need for more advanced technology it decided to seek help from 
overseas counterparts. (Gong Zaisheng) says that the blocks at 
the mouth of the Pearl river have large oil deposits. During 
the four day bidding, the China National Offshore Oil 
Corporation will not only tell potential investors about the 
geology of the areas, but also exchange technology with their 
overseas counterparts. 
  The explorations in the South China Sea are important for 
south China which is suffering from a shortage of energy. 
According to the English newspaper CHINA DAILY, Guangdong 
Province will need to triple its current energy capacity in 
order to cope with the rapidly expanding economic growth in the 
area. Hainan, Fujian, and Guangxi are also expected to 
experience increased demands. At present, the southern 
provinces transport more than 1 million tonnes of coal from 
north China every year to meet the demand. Geologist (Gong 
Zaisheng) says his company is planning to build a long-distance 
gas pipeline which will serve major coastal cities. The pipeline 
will carry natural gas produced offshore in the South China Sea.

  [Text] Beijing, June 8 (XINHUA) -- China's coal industry 
is actively attracting foreign funds and importing advanced 
equipment and techniques to increase productivity. 
  An official with the Ministry of Coal Industry told XINHUA 
that over the past ten years, a total of four billion U.S. 
dollars in foreign capital has been used to upgrade China's coal 
mines. 
  This sum includes Japanese energy loans, World Bank loans, 
government loans from Sweden, Italy and other countries, and 
direct foreign investment. 
  The official said the Japanese energy loans, granted by the 
Japanese Ex-Im Bank, were the principal source of foreign funds 
China obtained to build mines and import equipment. 
  Three installments of the Japanese loans have already been 
contracted for the building of coal-production capacity 
amounting to 38 million tons, he added. 
  China began seeking foreign funds for its coal industry, the 
country's prominent supplier of energy, in 1982. Acknowledging 
this sector's long construction period, huge capital demand and 
low investment return, the state has been managing the use of 
the foreign loans. 
  However, the ministry has decided to expand the scope of 
foreign capital use, attracting foreign businessmen to directly 
invest in the industry by forming joint and cooperative ventures. 
  These ventures will center on more lucrative projects 
involving the construction of mines, pit-mouth power stations, 
coal-gasification plants, cement factories and pipelines for 
coal transportation. 
  The ministry believes that drawing foreign capital directly 
toward these projects will help to restructure the industry. 
"with limited capital sources, the state is unable to allocate 
massive investment in this regard," said Han Ying, vice-minister 
of coal industry, "so appropriate use of foreign funds is 
needed." 
  Negotiations are under way for a number of initial projects, 
including coal-gasification engineering in Henan Province, 
opencast mines and power plants in Inner Mongolia, pipeline for 
coal transportation from Shanxi to Shandong, two neighboring 
provinces in northern China. 
  The import of advanced equipment and technology started even 
earlier. In the 1970s, more than two hundred sets of fully 
mechanized mining equipment were introduced from western 
countries as well as some from Eastern European. 
  This effort was strengthened in the 1980s to equip coal 
mines 
with more advanced imported facilities, such as shearers, 
road-headers, hydraulic supports and high-capacity conveyers. 
  Now the index of mechanized mining in key state-run mines 
stands at 72 percent with fully-mechanized mining at 44 percent, 
the official said. 
  He said China plans to introduce more equipment and 
technology from abroad in the coming years to further upgrade 
the production level as well as the productivity of the coal 
industry. 
  China produced 1.14 billion tons of coal last year, ranking 
first in the world. Estimates show that by 2000, the coal 
output will reach 1.4 billion tons, providing 69 percent of the 
country's primary sources of energy. 
  The official said that an international meeting to attract 
foreign funds is scheduled for autumn this year. "new channels 
will be opened and more foreign capital used to shore up coal 
enterprises' capability of financing and promoting the 
development of the industry," he added.

<F P=106> [By reporter Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 8 Jun (XINHUA) -- The Import-Export Bank 
of China [IEBC], whose organization and establishment was 
approved by the State Council, officially started operations 
recently. Tong Zhiguang, the first chairman of the IEBC's board 
of directors, said in an interview with this reporter: The 
major task of the IEBC is to implement the state's industrial 
and foreign trade policies and offer policy-related financial 
support for expanding the export of China's machinery, 
electronic goods, equipment in complete sets, and other capital 
goods. 
  Tong Zhiguang said: The State Council's decision to 
establish the IEBC is not only an important decision on further 
deepening the reform of the financial system and economic 
structure and on opening wider to the outside world, but also a 
requirement for further developing China's foreign trade. Tong 
Zhiguang said: Over decades of efforts, China's foreign trade 
has grown considerably. In 1993, the total import and export 
value approached $200 billion. In the meantime, the structure 
of export goods has significantly improved from mainly exporting 
agricultural, sideline, local, and special products at the 
beginning to the export of light industrial goods, textiles, and 
daily consumer goods. Since reform and opening up, machinery, 
electronics goods, and equipment in complete sets has joined the 
ranks of export goods; their export value and proportion to the 
total export volume have risen constantly. In 1993, the export 
of machinery, electronics goods, and equipment in complete sets 
amounted to $22.7 billion, nearly one-fourth of the year's total 
export volume. However, compared with world's trading powers, 
whose export of machinery, electronics goods, and equipment in 
complete sets generally accounts for 80 percent of their total 
exports, China still has a long way to go. 
  Tong Zhiguang noted: Exporting machinery, electronics goods, 
and equipment in complete sets earns more foreign exchange. He 
said: Over some 40 years of construction, China's 
machine-building industry has developed a fairly complete 
system; its technological level and product quality have been 
greatly improved in the past few years and now have very strong 
competitiveness on the international market. For lack of 
necessary or full financial support in the past, however, China 
lost many chances to win international bids. Therefore, the 
State Council decided to set up an import-export bank with a 
view to supporting the development of China's exports, 
particularly the export of machinery, electronics goods, and 
equipment in complete sets, through financial means, to promote 
the upgrading of the structure of export goods. Tong Zhiguang 
explained: The IEBC operates on an independent and break-even 
principle and practices business management. The sources of the 
bank's capital, apart from funds allotted by the state, mainly 
come from refinancing with the People's Bank of China, issuing 
financial bonds in China and negotiable securities abroad, and 
funds raised from financial institutions at home and abroad. 
  Tong Zhiguang particularly stressed: Although the IEBC is a 
policy-lending bank, it is by no means an institution allotting 
funds without setting conditions. It is also managed in 
accordance with the general rules governing banks, but it will 
also carry out the state's industrial and foreign trade policies 
at the same time. He noted: In granting credits, the IEBC will 
mainly support export units who are in dire need of funds, 
capable of competing on the international market, and in the 
meantime, able to repay the capital and interest. It will also 
support units with a good foundation, management, and 
credibility; high technological level; and people familiar with 
the operations of importing and exporting. 
  Tong Zhiguang, 61, is a foreign trade expert. He has worked 
in China's foreign trade departments since 1951 and has been the 
head of the Sino-U.S. trade negotiating team, as well as head 
and chief representative of the Chinese negotiating team for 
rejoining GATT. Before assuming the post of chairman of the IEBC 
board of directors, he was vice minister of foreign trade and 
economic cooperation. Speaking on the IEBC's leadership 
structure, Tong Zhiguang said: The IEBC makes the bank president 
responsibile under the leadership of the board of directors, 
which is the bank's highest decision-making body and answerable 
to the State Council. Its specific functions include examining 
and finalizing the bank's medium and long-term plans, operating 
principles, and annual plan according to the state's industrial 
and foreign trade policies; supervising the bank's financial 
affairs, accounting, and the maintaining and increase in the 
value of state-owned assets; examining and approving financial 
budget, final accounts, and plan for after-tax profit 
distribution; discussing and making decisions on offering export 
credit guarantees and relevant policies depending on countries, 
taking credit risks, and other important decisions. Tong 
Zhiguang indicated that the bank will set up a strict assessment 
and examination system for determining the projects it will 
support and the amounts of loans.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by Lin Ying (2651 7751): "Transnational </F>
Corporations Regard Chang Jiang Delta as Golden Area for 
Investment"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 30 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Jiangsu 
Province and cities like Shanghai and Nanjing, which are located 
in the Chang Jiang Delta area, are some of the best places on 
the mainland in terms of industry, agriculture, culture, 
education, transportation, and telecommunications. The 
development of Shanghai's Pudong has added greater value to 
these places. No wonder transnational corporations regard this 
as "a golden area" for investment. 
  According to relevant statistics, a total of 185 
transnational corporations have set up 300 industrial and 
commercial enterprises in the Chang Jiang Delta area with a 
total investment of nearly $4 billion. These investment 
projects include electronic telecommunications, 
machine-building, automobile, computer, and biomedical 
enterprises. The number of medium and small foreign companies 
which have made investment there is even greater and the scope 
of their investment is more extensive. 
  Shanghai is a place in which transnational corporations are 
most interested in making investment. As early as 1980, the 
Schindler Corporation of Switzerland set up the first elevator 
plant in Shanghai and the operation of the plant has been quite 
successful. After that, many other transnational corporations 
also made investment in Shanghai one after another. To date, 
129 transnational corporations have set up 206 large projects in 
Shanghai and their total investment has reached $2.5 billion. 
Last year was a peak year for investment. Forty-five 
corporations signed 60 joint venture projects with enterprises 
in Shanghai and their investment amounted to $1 billion. In the 
first quarter of this year, another 11 transnational 
corporations invested in 15 projects in Shanghai and their total 
investment was close to $1 billion. 
  Of the transnational corporations which have made 
investments 
in Shanghai, U.S. corporations rank first in terms of the amount 
of investment; then come those from Japan, Britain, and Germany. 
With its development in the past four years and more, the U.S. 
AT and T Corporation in Shanghai has become a backbone 
enterprise in the modern telecommunications industry on the 
mainland and its products account for a quarter of those on the 
mainland market. The corporation has reaped considerable 
profits. The Xerox Photocopier Corporation has 43 percent of 
the mainland market. The profits made by a joint venture 
involving the U.S. Carrier Corporation in Shanghai has reached a 
total of 700 million yuan in six years. 
  Since the beginning of this year, some transnational 
corporations have competed with one another to hold negotiations 
in Shanghai on investment and cooperation. These include 
American Express, Shell of Britain, Ciba Geigy Pharmaceutics of 
Sweden, and so on. They plan to cooperate with Shanghai in 
manufacturing telecommunications equipment, electrical machines, 
cars, and medicines, and to issue credit cards. 
  Jiangsu Province takes up much of the Chang Jiang Delta and 
has big cities like Nanjing, Wuxi, Nantong, Changzhou, and 
Suzhou. Jiangsu is one of the mainland provinces which have 
attracted the greatest amount of investment made by 
transnational corporations. According to statistics, 56 
transnational corporations have invested in Jiangsu at present 
and their total investment is close to $1.5 billion. For 
example, Japan's Mitsubishi has invested $115 million to set up 
the Suzhou Lingkang Chemical Fiber Company Limited; Britain's 
BOC Group has made investment in the Zhangjiagang Biouxi Gaseous 
Industry Company Limited; Germany's Siemens Corporation has 
invested in the Wuxi Siemens Power Station Automation Company 
Limited; and Japan's Sharp Corporation has invested $50 million 
to set up its solely-owned Changshu Sharp Office Machines 
Company Limited. Besides, Japan's Iwai, Marubeni, C. Ito, Toyo, 
and other financial groups have also invested large amounts of 
money in various localities in Jiangsu and the average amount of 
investment in each project has reached $20 million. 
  The investment made in Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu 
Province, accounts for about half of the total foreign 
investment made in the province. Many transnational 
corporations have made investment jointly with Nanjing and set 
up a number of large enterprises. These corporations include the 
Phillips Corporation of the Netherlands, the Siemens Corporation 
of Germany, and so on. The average amount of investment in each 
project is about $15 million. 
  The momentum mentioned above indicates that investment made 
by transnational corporations in the Chang Jiang Delta area is 
in the ascendant.

  [Text] Beijing, June 8 (CNS) -- The Vice Minister of 
Chemical Industry, Mr. Cheng Siwei, speaking of plant diseases 
and pests shortly before their peak, suggested today that 
production of pesticide be given the same attention as grain 
production and the "food basket" project, an item to achieve a 
balance in demand and supply of non-staple food. The state 
should adopt preferential policy to lend support to such an idea. 
  According to the national plant protection headquarters, 
1994 
would be a year of fairly serious plant diseases and pests. The 
ministry is scheduled to produce 210,000 tonnes of pesticide of 
176 varieties this year. As of late last April production of 
pesticide was put at 75,900 tonnes. Mr. Cheng was convinced 
that varieties and quantity of pesticide turned out could by and 
large meet the need to prevent and control plant diseases and 
pests. 
  From the viewpoint on a long term, Mr. Cheng, however, said 
that the pesticide production industry should be further 
exploited with implementation of a number of measures. [as 
received] 
  First, pesticide produced at present should be further 
improved because the current pesticide is not as effective as 
some new varieties now being developed overseas. Germicide and 
herbicide shared a rather small portion in pesticide production. 
  Second, the vice minister put forward a proposal that the 
state should adopt some measures to support pesticide production 
because pesticide was used only in farming, which was naturally 
subject to the profit the farming sector was able to make. As 
agricultural productivity was still rather low in China, the 
pesticide production industry had shown poor economic results 
and in fact it suffered a loss last year. 
  Third, Mr. Cheng also suggested that a reserve fund for 
pesticide production be set up. New variety of pesticide should 
be developed and establishment of two centres in southern and 
northern China for exploitation of pesticide should be 
accelerated. 
  The vice minister attributed the false and poor quality 
pesticide which flooded the market during the busy season each 
year to loose administration of pesticide production and of the 
sales market. Peasants' lack of knowledge of false and inferior 
pesticide added fuel to the spread of such phenomenon. He 
called for strict law to curb false pesticide.

<F P=106> [Article by Hsiao Ming (5618 2494): "A `Controversy' Is </F>
Being Provoked Again"] 
  [Text] The Background Against Which Deng Xiaoping 
Proposed To "Refrain From Controversy" 
  Deng Xiaoping said: "Not to engage in controversy is one of 
my inventions." As I understand it, an "invention" means a 
special measure under special circumstances. In other words, 
socialist reform is valuable because it is aimed at emancipating 
the mind. To develop socialist productive forces, one should 
not be afraid of adopting some capitalist managerial experience, 
its technical innovations, and its organizational methods in 
production. We should not think that this is practicing 
capitalism, nor should we provoke a controversy over whether 
what we are doing is of a capitalist or socialist nature, as 
this could bind reformers hand and foot (to put it more bluntly, 
this could be as bad as banning and opposing reform). 
  This refers to the repudiation provoked by the leftists in 
the period after the 4 June incident to 1990, which criticized 
reform as "retrogressing to capitalism." As a matter of fact, 
this repudiation was targeted at Deng Xiaoping, therefore some 
people regarded it as "repudiating Deng" for the second time. 
During his southern tour, Deng Xiaoping pointed out that the 
main danger was "leftist" tendencies (but people should also be 
on the alert for rightist tendencies), adding that the 
controversy over what was being done was of a capitalist or 
socialist nature was inappropriate. Deng Xiaoping's response to 
the "leftists" offensive was quite "mild and moderate." Instead 
of "drawing a sword," he only said "we should not engage in 
controversy" for the sake of maintaining stability in reform, he 
only tried to prevent both sides from engaging in controversy. 
<H5>  The Magazine ZHENLI DE ZHUIQIU [IN PURSUIT OF TRUTH] </H5>
Provoked a Controversy 
  Silence prevailed in the ideological field for a period of 
time after Deng Xiaoping's southern tour talks. Some people 
wrote several "leftist" articles, but they were not strong 
enough to create the necessary climate. It was said that it was 
very difficult to have articles published, and even the 
authorities did not support such publications. But this did not 
in the least harm the "leftists!" Some people tried to run 
middle-of-the-road publications and asked some famous people to 
express insignificant remarks. This enabled the "leftists" to 
clearly see the opponent's weakness. Thus the "leftists" waited 
for an opportunity to provoke a new trouble. After making all 
the necessary preparations, they thought the time was ripe for a 
new controversy. 
  At that time, I went to the mainland and heard people 
commenting on several articles in a magazine called ZHENLI DE 
ZHUIQIU. These articles were published in issue No. 4 of this 
year's ZHENLI DE ZHUIQIU. The most conspicuous one was a 
"commentator's article" published by the magazine. I happened 
to see the magazine at a friend's home and began reading the 
article quickly. 
  As I was not an expert in this respect, it was a little 
difficult for me to understand the meaning, not because it was 
abstruse, but because it was evasive. After reading it twice, I 
finally understood these two points: First, it pointed out that 
"bourgeois liberalization is still the biggest danger on the 
ideological front," therefore it urged launching a powerful 
criticism "like the one occurring after the 4 June political 
storm." Apart from directly asserting that opposing "leftist" 
tendencies was "liberalization," the article did not explicitly 
indicate the performance of "liberalization" at that time. 
Instead, it cited many problems and difficulties arising in 
reform, such as inflation, excessive price hikes, loss-incurring 
state enterprises, loss of state assets, prominent regional 
differences between the poor and the rich, corruption, and 
rampant malpractice. The article pointed out it was natural 
that these had happened, but that these problems should be 
resolved. By citing these examples, did it mean that all these 
problems were the results of "liberalization"? 
<H5>  The Purpose Was To Criticize the Theory of Focusing on </H5>
Economic Construction 
  Another main point of the article was criticizing the 
proposition of "poor socialism." For this reason, the article 
launched an offensive against "bourgeois liberalization." The 
article said there had never been "poor socialism" in the 
Marxist dictionary, adding that this expression was mere trash 
and was completely anti-Marxist; socialism advocates common 
prosperity and the elimination of exploitation; poverty has 
nothing to do with socialism. I was confused. As everyone 
remembers, it was Deng Xiaoping who first said "poverty is not 
socialism" and who first criticized the idea of "poor 
socialism." It is true that Marx never mentioned "poor 
socialism," but China's socialism did proceed from poverty. 
  In 1956, when China asserted that it had become a socialist 
society, this socialist society could not be regarded as rich. 
If it could not be called a "poor socialist society," it would 
do if we called it an "undeveloped socialist society." As Deng 
Xiaoping pointed out, strictly speaking, this socialist society 
cannot be regarded as a "qualified" socialist society. But this 
"undeveloped socialist society" is a reality in China. No one 
can deny it. In other words, this is a historic fact. 
Obviously, the criticism of "practicing poor socialism" was a 
criticism of the erroneous ultraleftist policy--a policy of 
"taking class struggle as the key link." The Great Leap 
Forward, the people's communes, and the Great Cultural 
Revolution were examples of the implementation of this 
ultraleftist policy. It was this policy that undermined the 
vitality of socialist productive forces and left many localities 
in prolonged poverty. This was a grave lesson in socialism, not 
the glory of socialism. Now the gentlemen who were "in pursuit 
of truth" revealed this historic fact and started saying in 
abstract that there was no such thing as poor socialism. What 
was their purpose? Marx did not favor egalitarianism, but China 
previously practiced socialism with different degrees of 
egalitarianism. Was this not a fact? It was strange that they 
"pursued truth" by engaging in empty talk regardless of the 
facts. Evidently, these gentlemen's purpose was to criticize 
the theory of focusing on economic construction and developing 
the productive forces, but they did not dare to conduct a direct 
criticism, so they took an evasive method. 
<H5>  How the New Controversy Was Provoked </H5>
  This friend of mine did not know how the new controversy had 
been provoked, but only said that it had been brewing for more 
than two months. On the eve of the Spring Festival, the CPC 
opened a national meeting on propaganda and ideological work. 
At the meeting, a leader made a significant remark in his 
speech--a remark which interested those gentlemen who thought 
the opportunity for a controversy had come. Thus they were 
ready for such a move. 
  In my opinion, if the authorities could look further into 
the 
future, controversy is not a good thing. At that time, Deng 
Xiaoping proposed "not to engage in a controversy," out of 
consideration for maintaining stability in reform. The 
situation has remained stable in the last few years because many 
people have refrained from controversy. Now there are many 
comments in China and abroad on China's situation after Deng 
Xiaoping's death. These comments vary with different people. 
Many think that there will be a change and political turmoil in 
China. As this leader is at a venerable age, like a candle 
guttering in the wind, the policy of stability must be pursued 
and efforts must be concentrated on resolving problems in 
reform, instead of allowing a controversy on the ideological 
front or provoking trouble. Otherwise, this could lead to evil 
consequences. Letting tigers out the cage harms oneself; 
thinking oneself clever kills oneself. There have been many 
such examples. If a controversy arises on the ideological 
front, this will cause differences of opinion among leaders 
(including retired leaders) on the policy and line to be 
adopted. People throughout the country who have embarked on the 
track of reform will not sit idly by either. In such cases, 
stability in reform could be ruined and no one can remedy it, 
and China could face a confused situation or retrogress to the 
period before 1978. This is a weakness in China's reform and a 
danger for its future. The CPC should seriously take this into 
account.

  [Text] On the occasion of the first founding anniversary 
of Nanchang University, State Council Premier Li Peng and Vice 
Premier Li Lanqing wrote inscriptions for the university. 
Premier Li Peng's inscription reads: Raise the level of 
running a school and rejuvenate Jiangxi's economy. Vice Premier 
Li Lanqing's inscription reads: Bring the combined strong 
points into play, further improve teaching quality and the 
social benefit of running a school, and contribute to running 
well a new-type university. 
  Under the correct leadership of the provincial party 
committee and government and with the support of the State 
Education Commission, Nanchang University has achieved 
gratifying results in teaching, scientific research, production, 
and spiritual civilization building, and enhanced its overall 
management capability since its founding on 4 May last year. 
In the past year, the university has strengthened teaching 
reforms focusing on the credit, elimination, and rolling 
competetion systems, thus improving teaching quality. The first 
acceptance rate on the national English examination of 1992 
students increased from 47 percent scored before the merger of 
two schools to 64.98 percent. At the same time, the university 
has achieved initial results in expansion of key disciplines. 
It has become a pre-doctoral education unit with an additional 
unit of Ph.D. graduate students, two doctoral tutors, and nine 
units of students studying for a master's degree, thus ending 
the situation in which there has been not any unit of Ph.D. 
graduate students in Jiangxi for a long time.

  [Text] Suzhou, 8 Jun -- A national conference on the 
comprehensive management work on public security in rural areas 
opened in Wujiang City, Jiangsu Province today. The conference 
called for severely and promptly punishing all kinds of serious 
criminal elements in accordance with the law to create a more 
favorable social environment for reform and development. 
  Ren Jianxin, CPC Central Committee Secretariat member and 
Central Committee for Comprehensive Management of Public 
Security [CCCMPS] chairman, chaired the conference and relayed 
important instructions from central leading comrades. 
  The conference was jointly held by the CCCMPS, the CPC 
Central Committee Organization Department, and the Public 
Security, Justice, and Civil Affairs Ministries to further 
implement the guidelines of the central conference on rural 
work; disseminate advanced experience in upholding material and 
spiritual civilizations simultaneously to achieve economic 
development and social stability; arrange to make concentrated 
efforts to improve public order in rural areas where it is not 
good; and vigorously strengthen comprehensive management of 
public order to further improve the public security situation in 
the countryside and promote all-round development of rural work. 
  In his speech, Luo Gan, state councillor and CCCMPS vice 
chairman, pointed out: Today, our country is in an important 
historic period of reform and development. Good public order 
and stable social environment are important conditions for 
reform and development. All these years, the party Central 
Committee and the State Council have always regarded 
agricultural, rural, and peasant issues as fundamental issues 
affecting the overall interests of the party and country, and 
they have adopted a series of effective measures to promptly and 
appropriately resolve the prominent issues in rural work. This 
has promoted rural stability and development. 
  Luo Gan said: In recent years, many localities have 
rectified public order in many rural areas where it was not 
good. The CCCMPS has also made arrangements to combat thieves, 
pursue and annihilate "train and highway bandits," and launch 
other special struggles closely related to public order in rural 
areas. Some results have been obtained. The current situation 
of public order in rural areas is generally good, although in 
some local areas problems of public order are fairly prominent. 
  It was learned that the current work on rectifying public 
order in rural areas will focus on cracking down on offenders of 
serious crimes in four areas: 1) Evil forces of hooligans, 
particularly gangs of hooligans and burglars, as well as 
criminal rings with the characteristics of secret societies [he 
she hui 7815 4357 2585]; 2) bandits on trains, cars, and ships, 
as well as criminals who commit murder, robbery, explosion, 
rape, and other violent crimes; 3) criminals who sabotage 
railroads, telecommunications, power, and production facilities, 
or who commit other serious crimes such as stealing or robbing 
state properties; and 4) criminals who transport and sell 
narcotics, organize prostitution, kidnap and sell women and 
children, and manufacture or disseminate pornographic materials. 
  Luo Gan stressed: In conducting the work of rectifying 
public order in rural areas, party committees, governments, and 
departments concerned at all levels should fully understand the 
necessity of strengthening comprehensive management of public 
order in rural areas, persist in severely and promptly punishing 
all kinds of serious criminal elements in accordance with the 
law, implement legal and educational measures against people who 
break the law by committing minor offenses, strengthen forces in 
towns and townships in charge of comprehensive management of 
public order, extensively and profoundly launch activities to 
manage villages according to the law, and improve and strengthen 
work of publicizing the legal system among peasants. In 
particular, it is necessary to make vigorous efforts to 
strengthen village party branches and village committees and to 
build self-governing organizations of the masses to institute a 
system of responsibility in managing public order so that there 
are truly people who are in charge and attend to the work of 
comprehensive management of public order. It is necessary to 
establish and perfect crime prevention mechanism in society, 
encourage the masses to combat bad things and bad persons, and 
mobilize and organize the masses to build up grassroots 
organizations and quickly change the face of public order. 
  Luo Gan asked all localities to closely combine efforts in 
rectifying public order in rural areas with efforts to 
vigorously develop the rural economy, improve public order to 
safeguard economic construction in rural areas, and promote the 
building of spiritual civilization and grassroots organizations. 
He asked them to strengthen rural public order from the sources 
by carrying out economic construction and the construction of 
spiritual civilization and grassroots organizations and by 
consolidating and developing the achievements made in rectifying 
public order in rural areas. 
  Zhang Siqing, CCCMPS vice chairman, and persons in charge of 
departments concerned attended the conference.

New York on 7 June: "Jiang Qisheng Was Detained by Police for 
Investigation After Visiting Ding Zilin"] 
  [Text] Jiang Qisheng, former graduate student of the 
Chinese People's University and executive member of the student 
delegation to the dialogue with the government, was "kidnapped" 
by public security personnel on 28 May on campus after visiting 
Ding Zilin, an associate professor at the university, and made a 
humanitarian donation of money to the families of the victims of 
the 4 June Incident. After continuous inquiries by his wife 
Zhang Hong, the Public Security Sub-bureau of Beijing's Xicheng 
District finally admitted that Jiang Qisheng was "under 
detention for investigation." 
  According to Xiang Xiaoji, a responsible person of the 
former 
student delegation to the dialogue who is now living in New 
York, Zhang Hong, who is working with the Shoudu Teacher's 
University, asked the authorities why Jiang Qisheng had been 
"detained for investigation" but the public security authorities 
refused to give an answer. After Zhang Hong's repeated 
requests, on 3 June, the Xicheng Public Security Sub-bureau 
allowed her to take some clothes to No 3 Detention Center in 
Beijing's Qinghe Longgang, but she was not allowed to bring 
Jiang a quilt to prevent him from committing suicide. Only then 
did Zhang Hong know where her husband was detained. 
  Jiang Qisheng was born in Changshu, Jiangsu. He was enrolled 
in the Chinese People's University in 1988 as a doctorate 
candidate in the Department of Philosophy. In the prodemocracy 
movement in 1989, together with Xiang Xiaoji and Shen Tong, 
Jiang Qisheng became one of the executive members of the student 
delegation to the dialogue and one of the executive members of 
the Autonomous Student Council in the Chinese People's 
University. He also managed the "Voice of Beijing" broadcast 
station. After the 4 June Incident, Jiang Qisheng was jailed in 
Beijing's Qincheng Prison and was released on 7 February 1991. 
  After his release, Jiang Qisheng continued his theoretical 
research and also helped Ding Zilin, who lost her son in the 4 
June Incident, in visiting families of other victims and to 
distribute the donation money to them. Thus, he was traced by 
the security personnel. On 5 April, he was openly beaten up by 
the security personnel. Jiang did not give in and demanded that 
those who used violence against him make a written apology to 
him; otherwise, he would take legal action against them in order 
to safeguard his personal freedom and dignity.

  [Text] Beijing, June 8 (AFP)--Shanghai police have 
launched a formal investigation into prominent Chinese 
dissident, Bao Ge, who was detained on the eve of the fifth 
anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, a relative said 
Wednesday. 
  Police told Bao's family that the dissident had "broken the 
law" and said, without further explanation, that an inquiry had 
been opened, the relative said by telephone. Bao was detained 
last Friday, the day before the anniversary of the crushing of 
the pro-democracy movement in Beijing. 
  The source said several police searched Bao's parents' home 
late Tuesday, and his mother was called to the police station. 
But it was not known on Wednesday whether she had been released. 
  The official detention and investigation papers released to 
the family were dated June 5, two days after the dissident's 
arrest, the source said. 
  "Detention for the purposes of investigation should only be 
applied in cases where identity is uncertain, but it is the most 
widely used method by the police to keep the political 
opposition locked up for as long as possible," said Robin Munro, 
the Hong Kong based director of Human Rights Watch/Asia. 
  He added that a measure adopted by the government in 1980, 
stipulated that detention in such cases should not exceed three 
months. 
  Police in Shanghai contacted by telephone refused to confirm 
the reports and a spokesman for the public security bureau here 
said he was unaware of the incident. 
  Bao, 31, a former teacher of medicine, is one of China's 
most 
active dissidents. He was detained after he unveiled a new human 
rights organisation to mark the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. 
The group, which was said to have 167 members, is demanding the 
right to free trade unions, freedom of religion and compensation 
for the descendants of people killed in the Japanese occupation 
of China in the 1930s and 1940s, as well as for relatives of 
protestors slain by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) five 
years ago. 
  Bao's detention followed interrogations in April and May of 
the leaders of the Chinese Human Rights Organisation, also 
based in Shanghai. 
  The group's secretary general, Wang Fucheng, was questioned 
April 14 and put under house arrest. Li Guotao, the group's 
president was arrested May 2 and spokesman Yang Zhou, was picked 
up ten days later. 
  "We haven't heard any news from Wang Fucheng for a month and 
a half," a member of his family said Wednesday, adding that the 
dissidents' telephone lines had been cut.

<F P=106> [Article by Yu Xinyan (0151 1800 6056): "Whose `Human </F>
Rights' Are They Concerned About?"] 
  [Text] Some Westerners always use the big stick of "human 
rights" against us. They repeatedly talk about "human rights" 
as if only they are concerned about the rights of the Chinese as 
men, the truth were with them, we Chinese were not concerned 
about the rights of our own compatriots as men, and we remain 
stubborn and extremely ignorant despite their repeated urging 
(which is in fact coercion). 
  However, we cannot but doubt whether these Westerners are 
really concerned about us and whether they are concerned about 
the rights of we Chinese as men. Because we remember very well 
that it was they (perhaps their fathers and grandfathers) who 
came to China to slaughter us Chinese, rob us of our property, 
rape our women, and trample on the rights of us as men. Now 
they say their human rights concept is a great, consistent, and 
globally recognized value. Moreover, they also say that they do 
not have any intention of imposing it upon us. There always 
seems to be some contradiction here. 
  The history of China's humiliation by Western imperialism 
dates back to the year 1840. In that year, China fought a war 
with Britain called the "Opium War." Did the war have anything 
to do with "human rights?" The Chinese fought for the right to 
prevent themselves from opium poisoning. Perhaps the two sides 
stood by their own human rights. Was there justice in the 
matter? Anyway, China was defeated. Imperialists throughout 
the world held that the principle of "fair trade" had won. The 
result of the war was the signing of the Treaty of Nanjing, 
whereby Hong Kong was occupied by Britain for over 100 years. 
The history of China's entry into a semicolonial society began 
here. 
  However, it is completely wrong if one thinks that the 
British imperialists were only concerned about the "human 
rights" of British merchants and were unconcerned about the 
"human rights" of Chinese. One should know that their human 
rights concept has really been "consistent." 
  Article nine of the Treaty of Nanjing reads: 
  "All Chinese who have inhabited a city occupied by the 
British, who have dealings with the British, and who follow and 
attend to British officials, will have their guilt completely 
pardoned by the grace of the great emperor through a royal 
decree and such things will be made known to the world. All 
Chinese who have been arrested and imprisoned on British 
business will also be forgiven." 
  Such wonderful wording was perhaps the first official record 
of how Western imperialists showed concern about China's human 
rights, or it was at least the first record of a Sino-foreign 
diplomatic treaty. 
  It is said that the Western concept "human rights" means 
that 
all men are born with equal rights. Therefore, Westerners have 
adopted an attitude of general concern for China's "human 
rights," and the phrase they used in the first place was "all 
Chinese." 
  However, any genuine concern for the rights of the Chinese 
is 
out of the question. Otherwise, they would not have come to 
China with guns and cannons and forced opium on the Chinese. In 
the words that followed, they concretely explained the four 
types of people they were really concerned about: All "who have 
inhabited a city occupied by the British," "who have dealings 
with the British," "who follow and attend to British officials," 
and "who are arrested and imprisoned on British business." In a 
word, they were traitors who helped the British fight the 
Chinese and harm the Chinese. In what way were they cared for? 
"Guilt completely pardoned," and those arrested to be 
"released" and made "known to the world" so that their names 
would be known all over the world and that glory would be with 
them, thus encouraging more Chinese to follow their example and 
facilitate them exploit Chinese of all their rights as men. 
  The Treaty of Nanjing was signed by the Chinese under the 
coercion of British gunboats. Nonetheless, those crafty 
imperialists never forgot equality in form. In article nine, 
there was no such phrase such as the "British demand" nor the 
"two sides agree." The "initiative" all rested with the emperor 
of the great Qing Dynasty. What fine-sounding phrases as "royal 
decree" and "by the grace." Why did the British not 
reciprocate? Why could the guilt of the British working for the 
Chinese not be pardoned and why could their names not be made 
known to the world? It should have been the internal affair of 
the Chinese themselves to punish Chinese who committed crimes in 
China. But an internal affair had been written down in a 
diplomatic treaty. With this as a precedent, some Westerners 
often say: You have arrested so-and-so and violated human 
rights. We are unhappy about this and must impose sanctions on 
you. Is this strange? No. They have always done this. 
  Nevertheless, it seems that their "human rights" pretext 
needs to be changed to "traitor's rights." It is the right 
phrase. Of course, they will never make such a change. If they 
did, they would find it difficult to deceive people. But the 
Chinese pay attention to reality, and, for the sake of the 
rights of more than 1.1 billion Chinese as men, we cannot but 
deprive a few traitors of their rights. There is no way out 
other than this. 
  The Chinese have already had dealings with imperialism for 
over 100 years and this is valuable wealth. Not forgetting this 
historical episode makes one a little clearer.

  [Text] Geneva, June 8 (XINHUA) -- China calls the 
International Labor Organization (ILO) to respect member 
countries' right to choose their own path of development and 
strengthen its cooperation with them. 
  The call was made today by a Chinese delegate at the 81st 
International Labor Conference in Geneva. 
  Addressing the conference, Chinese Labor Minister Li Boyong 
said that in a world moving towards multi-polarity, the ILO 
should help to resolve the ideological controversies left over 
by the long-time bipolar confrontation. 
  He called on the ILO to show full consideration for the 
various social systems and values of its member countries and 
stop using a single pattern to assess them all. 
  He urged the organization to step up its cooperation with 
member states and so promote global economic prosperity, defend 
social justice and protect workers' rights and interests. 
  Li said that with unemployment being the most pressing 
problem in both the advanced and the developing countries, the 
ILO should make work promotion as its main priority. 
  According to statistics from the International Labor Office, 
the number of people registered jobless in the world now exceeds 
120 million, and 700 million more are underemployed. 
  Li also called for the ILO to use a more flexible labor 
standard suitable for a broader application. 
  But he said that the ILO should not use the standard as a 
condition for technological cooperation with member states, as 
it would not work if the ILO were to impose standardization on 
the developing world. 
  The Chinese minister briefed the conference on the labor 
situation in China, where job promotion, the elimination of 
poverty and the protection of workers' interests have always 
been an important part of the government's work. 
  The rate of urban unemployment in China has remained at the 
low level of under three percent in the 1990s, while the average 
real salary is up by 4.5 percent, said Li. 
  The Chinese Government has also expanded the range of 
unemployment insurance and provides social insurance for retired 
workers, he said. 
  In transition from a planned to a market economy, Li 
concluded, proceeding from the specific situation and learning 
from the experiences of the advanced countries could help to 
avoid social turmoil and economic recession. 
  The International Labor Conference, ILO's most authoritative 
organ, began its annual session on Tuesday [7 June].

Foreign-Invested Enterprises Correctly Handle Labor-Capital 
Relations"] 
  [Text] This reporter learned from the Fujian Federation of 
Trade Unions a few days ago that a number of foreign-invested 
enterprises in Fujian had, over the last few years, correctly 
handled labor-capital relations, operated and organized trade 
unions according to law, and safeguarded workers' legitimate 
rights and interests. 
  There is a Fujian Hitachi Television Set Company Ltd. in 
Fuzhou, a Sino-Japanese joint venture established in late 1980. 
In the early days of the company, it organized, at the Chinese 
side's insistence, a trade union according to China's relevant 
regulations and international practice. The trade union has 
earnestly exercised its four social functions as required by the 
central government and carried out various activities, focusing 
on promoting democratic management of the enterprise, raising 
economic efficiency, enhancing workers' moral standards and 
professional competence, and promoting cultural progress, and 
has achieved marked results. They set up China's first congress 
of workers and staff of a joint venture in 1989, and then 
established democratic managerial bodies at the team, workshop, 
and factory levels. To institutionalize and standardize 
democratic management involving workers and staff, the trade 
union formulated regulations on the congress of workers and 
staff and the trade union members' representative assembly so 
workers and staff would really participate in democratic 
management of the enterprise. The congress of workers and staff 
has called 14 sessions since its founding to examine the 
enterprise's major management decisions including the 
enterprise's "annual management guidelines and objectives." 
  The trade union also regarded signing and honoring labor 
contracts as its central task. After studying China's relevant 
laws and regulations and conducting many investigations, they 
worked out labor contracts acceptable to both the owner and the 
workers of the enterprise. In the process of enforcing the 
contract, the trade union played an active supervisory role so 
that the contract was observed. In a certain year, the workers 
were each entitled to a bonus equivalent to one or 
one-and-a-half months' wages since they had fulfilled the 
production quota, but the Japanese side only agreed to grant a 
bonus amounting to half-a-month's wages. The trade union argued 
strongly on just grounds on behalf of the workers, and finally 
the Japanese side agreed to pay the bonus in full as stipulated 
in the contract. Since labor-capital relations have been stable 
enabling workers to bring their wisdom into full play, the 
enterprise has grown with each passing day and has become an 
important production and export base for television sets in 
China. 
  China Fuwan (Fujian) Toys Company Ltd., is another joint 
venture with distinctive features. This Chinese-Japanese 
company has done a large amount of work in enforcing China's 
laws and regulations on labor protection, exercising management 
with civility, and ensuring workers' health. 
  In a visit to the company, this reporter found that the 
workshops were spacious and bright and air conditioners were 
installed in most. Electric fans were provided for some 
workshops where air conditioners were unsuitable for production. 
Every day workers had two 10-minute breaks during which they 
were allowed to buy cold drinks and enjoy a chat with friends at 
the small shop attached to the company. To stimulate the 
workers' cultural life in their spare time, the company 
authorized the trade union to establish a club, a reading room, 
and a singing-and-dancing hall. They took special care of women 
workers, giving them articles for sanitation every month, and 
requiring them to have a physical check-up every two years. In 
March this year, a women worker's house caught fire causing a 
great loss for her. The trade union workers immediately rushed 
to her place to express sympathy and solicitude and encouraged 
other fellow workers to make donations. Again, they made a 
claim to the insurance company for damages on her behalf so that 
she would overcome her difficulties. 
  The Nanan Baoqun Shoe Company Ltd., wholly owned by a Taiwan 
businessman, enjoys a good reputation in Fujian. Wang Kuo-hui, 
the Taiwanese board-of-directors chairman, has enthusiastically 
supported the trade union in its work and has taken good care of 
workers' lives, arousing enthusiasm for production. Since the 
trade union was set up, he has given it full support in matters 
related to personnel allocations and workers' living expenses. 
In light of the situation that the work force is mainly 
composed of women, the trade union demanded the company provide 
special articles for labor protection to women workers, and Wang 
immediately acted as requested. In the hot season last year, 
Wang fixed ventilation equipment in the workshops at the trade 
union's suggestion and provided drinking water. On days off or 
festive occasions, the company provides special funds to the 
trade union for carrying out cultural activities or sports meets 
or to send outstanding workers to a scenic spot in Xiamen to 
spend their holidays. Wang also saw to it that the trade union 
played a safeguarding role in the enterprise. In September last 
year, when the company produced a new product involving more 
complicated procedures, the workers demanded higher wages. 
Based on investigations, the trade union considered the 
workers' demand reasonable. The company, which fully valued the 
trade union's advice, then agreed to grant additional wages.

Xiaomeng (5170 0879 1125): "Zhongnanhai and the Hope Project"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 7 Jun (XINHUA) -- The "Hope Project" is a 
great enterprise. The older generation of the proletariat 
revolutionaries and party and state leaders have shown 
enthusiasm, concern, and support for it ever since the first day 
of its birth. In September 1990, Deng Xiaoping, chief architect 
of China's reform and opening up, obliged a request to inscribe 
the title "The Hope Project" with great pleasure. 
  In October 1989, the China Youth Development Foundation made 
the following announcement to the world: Let's implement the 
"Hope Project," set up China's first foundation to help children 
in impoverished areas, and enable hundreds and thousands of poor 
children who dropped out of school to return to school. 
  Zhongnanhai [official residence of top leadership] shows 
concern about the enterprise which will not only benefit the 
present, but also future generations.... [ellipsis as published] 
<H8>  (1) </H8>
  On the eve of the Spring Festival in 1994, General Secretary 
Jiang Zemin braved a severe cold, crossed over mountain after 
mountain, and trekked across the great expanse of Shanxi. 
Arriving in a village or township, he would inquire about 
conditions at the kindergarten, primary, and secondary schools 
there. He praised Shanxi, saying Shanxi's building schools to 
solve children's schooling in impoverished areas was the right 
direction in implementing the "Hope Project." He pointed out: 
"Economic development and social progress, in the final 
analysis, are decided by the quality of the people and by the 
raising of the scientific and cultural level of the entire 
society. It takes more than 100 years to educate the people. 
Education is the foundation of everything. Any neglect in 
education constitutes a shortsighted and dangerous act. When 
embarking on rural education, it is necessary to proceed from 
local reality, readjust school setups, and train more primary 
and secondary-level talented people who are greatly needed for 
local development." 
  In his Government Work Rreport to the Second Session of the 
Eighth National People's Congress on 10 March 1994, Premier Li 
Peng said: "All levels of government must foster a long-term 
view; have a sense of urgency; stress enrollment work for 
school-age children in rural areas; strive to lower the dropout 
rate; and implement the `Hope Project' by mobilizing all social 
forces." 
  In March 1994, the China Youth Development Foundation 
promoted the Hope Project's "One Family Helps One Child" 
program. In their capacity as ordinary party members and 
citiznes, many party and government leaders, both in Zhongnanhai 
and in various localities, showed their support of the 
implementation of the Hope Project with practical deeds. 
Comrades including Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, 
Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao, Chen Yun, Wan Li, and Bo 
Yibo donated funds. 
  We saw a donor list at the China Youth Development 
Foundation: 
  On 31 March 1994, Comrade Jiang Zemin asked a comrade of the 
CPC Central Committee General Office to send a donation to the 
foundation to help children who dropped out of schools in 
impoverished areas. 
  On 30 March 1994, Comrade Song Ping and his wife entrusted a 
staff member to carry a 1,000-yuan donation along with a 
personal letter bearing the message: "For Hope Project in Yanan." 
  On 26 March 1994, Wen Jiabao, member of the CPC Central 
Committee Secretariat, entrusted his party branch to donate 800 
yuan to the foundation for the Hope Project. 
  On 8 April 1994, Comrade Chen Yun entrusted a staff member 
to 
carry a 5,000-yuan donation to the foundation, saying this 
foundation was for children who dropped out of school in old 
revolutionary areas and in impoverished areas. 
  On 2 June 1994, Comrade Wang Zhen and his wife visited and 
donated 2,000 yuan to the foundation, saying the donation is to 
be used in the Bijie area. He made a stopover there during the 
Long March many years ago. 
  ...... [ellipsis as published] 
  Zhongnanhai is bound closely to Hope Project. 
  (2) 
  On 10 June 1992, an ordinary sedan entered Beijing's 
Houyuanen Temple and stopped not far from the China Youth 
Development Foundation. Two middle-aged people alighted from 
the car and went into the foundation's office. They presented 
3,000 Renminbi [RMB] to the Hope Project. 
  According to regulations, foundation staff members should 
write down all donator's names and give them receipts; this is a 
strict system. Therefore, a staff member asked the two 
middle-aged people: "Would you please let us know the donator's 
name?" 
  The two declined to tell him the name of the donator, nor 
did 
they give a positive reply on the address, postal code, or work 
unit of the donator. One of the two just said: "Please accept 
the money. We were asked by a veteran member of the CPC to 
bring the money here. If you insist on writing something down, 
you can write that it was donated by a veteran CPC member!" 
  After more than 100 days, on 6 October the two people 
returned to the foundation's office in the same car. Once 
again, they presented 2,000 RMB in the name of "a veteran CPC 
member." 
  Who was the "veteran CPC member"? Comrades of the foundation 
learned the name after trying various channels. The "veteran 
CPC member" who refused to reveal his name was Deng Xiaoping. 
  As early as 1990, with a proletarian revolutionary's 
boldness 
of vision, Deng Xiaoping repeatedly gave advice on the issue of 
education: "If we want to realize modernization, the key lies 
in promoting science and technology. To develop science and 
technology, we must attach importance to education. Empty talk 
cannot realize modernization. We must have knowledge and 
capable people." "From a long-term point of view, we must 
attach importance to education, science, and technology. We 
have already wasted 20 years; the consequences would be 
unbearable if we still do not attach importance to them." "We 
must find ways and means to properly solve the problem of 
education even if we have to be restrained in some other fields 
and slow down a little on other projects." 
  The China Youth Development Foundation used all 5,000 RMB 
donated by Deng Xiaoping to subsidize education for children in 
the old revolutionary base area in Guangxi's Bose prefecture 
where Deng Xiaoping lived and fought. 
  The children in Bose prefecture wrote a letter to Deng 
Xiaoping after receiving his donation. The letter says: "When 
we learned that you donated 5,000 yuan to the Hope Project in 
the name of a `veteran CPC member' and the foundation sent the 
money to aid children in the old revolutionary base area in Bose 
prefecture who cannot afford to go to school, we all cried in 
excitement...we feel that although you are far away in Beijing 
your heart is close to us." 
  Deng Xiaoping, the general designer of China's reform and 
opening up, thinks about children who cannot afford to go to 
school and holds them in his heart; and he thinks about the 
future and hope of the motherland. 
<H8>  (3) </H8>
  In April 1992, the Chinese Communist Youth League [CYL] 
committee of organs directly under the jurisdiction of the party 
Central Committee and Work Committee for Organs under the 
Central Committee jointly launched activities of "donating money 
to show some love" for the construction of the "Hope Primary 
School in Yanan." Leading comrades of the central authorities 
enthusiastically responded to the activities. 
  From June to July in 1992, during activities to solicit 
donations for the building of the "Hope Primary School in 
Yanan," leading comrades of the party Central Committee and 
State Council took the lead in donating money for the project. 
From the valuable recording book for donations, we can see some 
familiar names, they include: 
  Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Ding Guangen, 
Yang Shangkun, Deng Yingchao, Yao Yilin, Song Ping, Bo Yibo, and 
Song Renqiong. 
  From party and state leaders to common staff members and 
from 
veteran comrades to young people who have just started their 
work after graduating from college, each donation involves a 
deep feeling and a touching story. 
  Li Peng, premier of the State Council, who repeatedly 
donated money for the project, said: "We were nurtured by the 
mountains, water, and people in Yanan. Today, when the people's 
living standard has generally been raised, the conditions there 
are still very poor. We cannot set our minds at ease. Helping 
children there solve their difficulties in attending school is 
our unshirkable responsibility." 
  Comrade Wan Li said: "Education is the fundamental thing in 
making a vital and lasting plan. Even if we have to tighten our 
belts, we must make some contributions to helping people in the 
old revolutionary base areas." 
  Another leading comrade said: "The amount of money I have 
donated is not very much, but it represents my goodwill. It is 
hoped that people of the whole country will show concern for and 
support the Hope Project, and give our children more hope." 
  Deng Yingchao was ill when she learned of the project, and 
she asked her secretary to send 1,000 RMB to the fund. This 
revolutionary of the older generation who repeatedly donated 
money to the society passed away three months later; the 1,000 
RMB was her last donation. 
  As of October 1992, organs and units as well as individuals 
directly under the central authorities had donated more than 
880,000 yuan to the fund. On 1 July 1993, the "Yanan Hope 
Primary School," which was filled with the good feelings of 
Zhongnanhai, was completed. It can accommodate 600 students in 
12 classes. 
  The leading action of people in Zhongnanhai has prompted 
millions of Chinese people to take similar action to show their 
love.

  Since October 1989, the Hope Project has developed for over 
four years. In this short period, it has achieved remarkable 
results. 
  According to the latest data, since initiation of the Hope 
Project more than four years ago, total donations have exceeded 
200 million yuan. The project has assisted 549,000 children who 
could not afford to attend schools in 27 provinces and 
autonomous regions to return to school. The fund has set up 204 
hope primary schools. 
  On 1 May 1993, Wan Li, honorary president of the China Youth 
Development Foundation, received some staff members of the 
foundation at his residence in Zhongnanhai. The retired veteran 
comrade who was chairman of the Standing Committee of the 
National People's Congress has profound feelings toward 
education. He said: Education is the fundamental and vital plan 
of our country. To develop education, the key lies in the work 
of leading cadres at various levels. Those leading cadres who 
do not attach importance to education are disqualified. Comrade 
Xiaoping always attaches great importance to education and is an 
outstanding leader with a far-sighted view. Leading cadres at 
various levels, regardless of their position, should all 
consider education as a major task in national construction, 
attach great importance to the task, and support education. 
  "The meaning of the Hope Project is not merely to aid 
tens of thousands of children who cannot afford to attend 
school. The more important thing is that it can arouse the whole 
society to shown concern for, and care about the growth of the 
next generation. The future of the country depends on the next 
generation, as does the prosperity or decline of the nation." 
Wan Li said passionately: "The Hope Project is not just a 
project of the CYL or the foundation. It is a great project and 
a cause related to the future of our country and people. The 
whole society must show concern for and support this project. 
The Hope Project has great hope. I hope the spirit of the 
project will be carried forward continuously!" 
  On 7 February this year, Wan Li made another speech on the 
Hope Project. He emphatically pointed out: "If everyone makes 
an effort, we can certainly develop education." He said: In 
cultivating cross-century talent, the key lies in education. 
Wealth is created by the people. If we have people with a good 
knowledge of science and technology, we will be able to make 
rural areas prosper and make the country rich and powerful. The 
Hope Project is a good thing. If we make concerted efforts, we 
can certainly achieve success in promoting education. 
  On 17 July 1993, Vice Premier of the State Council Li 
Lanqing 
who is in charge of education, spoke at a forum on "implementing 
the `Program for Reform and Development of China's Education' 
and the `Hope Project.'" He pointed out: The Hope Project is 
"very meaningful" because it can not only aid children who 
cannot afford to attend school but can also arouse the whole 
society to attach importance to, shown concern for, and support 
education. He pledged to urge governments at various levels to 
give greater support to the Hope Project. He said: Meanwhile, 
the Hope Project should also be publicized to enable people to 
understand how to take part in the work of aiding children who 
cannot afford to attend school. 
  Two months later, in meeting with representatives of winners 
of the first "awards for outstanding workers of the Hope 
Project," the vice premier again said: I fully support the Hope 
Project because it can arouse the whole society to support and 
help the development of education in the rural areas when the 
state is still short of money, supplies, and manpower. 
Meanwhile, I am convinced the Hope Project is not merely to 
gather money. It is significant because it can arouse the whole 
society to pay attention to education. 
  On the eve of "1 June" 1992, the State Council promulgated 
the "program for the development of our country's children in 
1990's" which considers "further promoting the Hope Project and 
helping children of poor families attend school" as important 
measures for protecting and ensuring the survival and 
development of children. 
  On 31 May this year, General Secretary Jiang Zemin and 
Premier Li Peng held a get-together with more than 200 children 
who took part in the "hand in hand" mutual assistance activities 
at Yingtai in Beijing. Among those children, many were able to 
return to school with the aid of the Hope Project. In their 
speeches, Jiang Zemin and Li Peng hoped China's children would 
grow in a healthy and robust manner under the sunshine of 
socialism and become a fresh force on various fronts of the 
motherland. The children used their young voices to express 
their determination: We will never let the party and people 
down! 
  The revitalization of the Chinese nation needs education! 
  For the future, for the children!

<F P=106> [Report: "Some Local Officials To Be Dismissed for Qiandao </F>
Lake Incident"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 5 Jun (WEN WEI PO)--According to an 
informed person here, the central leadership has decided to deal 
with a number of relevant local leaders after conclusion of the 
Qiandao Lake incident, and some officials will be dismissed from 
their posts. He said the central authorities hold that since 
the serious case occurred in the Qiandao Lake area, the relevant 
leaders there, of course, are to be held responsible to a 
certain degree. This person said the mainland currently 
practices the "one-vote negation system for comprehensive 
management of public order," that is to say, the performance of 
the leaders of a particular place is weighed against the public 
order of that place or against problems occurring there and 
their performance can be judged accordingly. 
  It is learned that the "serious robbery, arson, and murder 
case at Qiandao Lake" is due to be tried by the Hangzhou City 
Intermediate People's Court from 10 June onward. In the 
incident, three suspects killed 32 people by extremely cruel 
means, most of whom were Taiwan tourists.

<F P=106> ["Text of Mayor Huang Ju's Speech at the First Meeting of </F>
the Shanghai Municipal `Vegetable Basket' Project Leading Group, 
on 2 June 1992" -- place not given] 
  [Text] Comrades: 
  This is the first brief meeting of all members of the newly 
formed municipal "Vegetable Basket" Project Leading Group. 
Forming the leading group is an important decision of the 
municipal CPC Committee and government. There are two basic 
considerations in making this decision: First, the "vegetable 
basket" is a project of the people's wishes -- it affects 
Shanghai's economic development and all residents' livelihood. 
Party committees and governments at all levels should regard it 
as a top priority. Second, it is a complicated systems project 
-- it involves production, circulation, transportation, 
technology, fund supply, material supply, government policy, 
legislation, and work in other areas. In the current new 
situation of building a socialist market economic system, only 
by establishing an organ with high authoritativeness that suits 
the new situation can we ensure the project will be built, 
managed, and operated properly, and that it will be successful. 
  In short, the municipal government's decision to establish 
this special leading group is based on the overall situation -- 
it is a decision with great significance. For this reason, all 
members of the leading group, including myself, should have a 
strong sense of having an historical mission and should do our 
job with a strong sense of responsibility. We must not forget 
for a moment that all of us are members of the command of the 
"project of the people's wishes." We are not allowed to commit 
the slightest negligence or dereliction of duty -- we must 
succeed, we cannot afford to lose. This is the first thing I 
want to say at this meeting. 
  On behalf of the leading group, Comrade Jianzhu just set 
forth the leading group's work. I completely agree with him. 
Here, I would like to set four guidelines for ensuring the 
project's success: 
  First, we should carry out the project from the perspective 
of correctly handling the relationship among reform, 
development, and maintaining stability. Comrade Zemin said: 
"Anything that affects the people's basic daily needs and vital 
interests is a matter of top priority." The "vegetable basket," 
although small, affects all households and the stability of the 
entire society. Reform and development are inseparable from 
social stability. Only by truly and properly accomplishing work 
that affects the people's daily life and vital interests can we 
truly ensure success in our reform and development. Therefore, 
fundamentally speaking, the "vegetable basket" project is a 
matter of top priority waiting to be carried out by party 
committees and governments at all levels. Especially at a time 
when our reform is entering a stage in which we are striving to 
make breakthroughs in key areas and are launching package reform 
to tackle key issues, the "vegetable basket" project is a matter 
of top priority that affects our reform, development, stability, 
as well as the whole party and country. Success in the project 
is bound to have an important, far-reaching, and positive effect 
on deepening reform, broadening the scope of opening up, 
quickening the pace of development, and maintaining stability. 
  Second, we should aim high with new ideas and set a goal of 
developing a new round of the "vegetable basket" project. At 
present, Shanghai's "vegetable basket" project has developed to 
a certain scale and level. This is because the leadership of 
the past and present municipal party committee and government 
has always shown concern for, attached importance to, and 
seriously grasped the project. Now, in a new situation the 
municipal party committee and government have clearly put 
forward a proposal for completing a new round of the 
high-standard "vegetable basket" project for Shanghai within 
three years. At the same time, the municipal party committee 
and government are actively exploring new ways to undertake the 
"vegetable basket" project for an international metropolis from 
the 1990's to the beginning of the 21st century. Regarding this 
point, I put forward some opinions at the municipal conference 
on rural work held on 5 February this year. Today, I want to 
emphasize again that in undertaking a new round of the 
"vegetable basket" project, we must give prominence to two 
things: We must begin from a high starting point and have new 
ideas. By high starting point, this means we must fully embody 
the characteristics of Shanghai as a big city opened entirely to 
the outside world, and we must have in mind a huge market and 
smooth circulation of commodities. The general demand is that 
Shanghai must rank first in the nation in the field of 
agricultural modernization, and in particular, Shanghai must be 
determined to set an example to the nation in building the 
"vegetable basket" project. By new ideas, this means we must 
actively explore a new path for developing agriculture by 
opening it up to the outside world, as well as a new path for 
expanding agriculture through the application of science and 
technology. It means we should give up the past practice of 
attaching importance to building production bases to the neglect 
of commodity circulation and shift to the way of simultaneously 
grasping the building of production bases and commodity 
circulation. This means we must truly integrate the building of 
a new pattern of production with the building of a new 
production and marketing operation mechanism. 
  Third, we must further try to build a sound responsibility 
system for the "vegetable basket" project. The practice of the 
system of having administrative leaders assume responsibility 
for "vegetable basket" projects should be instituted, and the 
responsibility should assumed by leaders of different levels. 
In the municipality, I, as mayor, will assume responsibility. 
In the districts and counties, the responsibility shall be 
assumed by you, district and county heads. In building a sound 
"vegetable basket" project responsibility system, we must 
clearly define responsibilities on the basis of the system of 
management by the governments at two levels, the municipal 
government and the district and county governments. (1) The 
responsibility of the municipal government and that of the 
district and county governments must be clearly defined; (2) 
agricultural and commercial administrative departments must link 
up and coordinate their operations closely; and (3) government 
departments at all levels have the responsibility to participate 
in and support the project by coordinating efforts in the areas 
of funds, material, science and technology, transportation, and 
legal administration. At the same time, we must actively 
explore a new mechanism through which districts and counties can 
establish lateral links when undertaking the "vegetable basket" 
project. We must seriously sum up experience, explore new ways, 
and strengthen legal administration over the "vegetable basket" 
project. 
  Fourth, we should continue to improve policies on the 
"vegetable basket" project. In the past few years we have 
formulated a series of policies and measures to improve the 
project, but they are far from perfect and have not been able to 
meet the needs of a new round of the high-standard "vegetable 
basket" project. We shall strive to improve our policies and 
measures in three aspects: (1) Administrative assessment; (2) 
macroeconomic regulation and control; and (3) risk security. 
The general demand is to strive to satisfy the municipal 
people, vegetable growers, and traders through the improvement 
of policies. 
  These are the opinions that I have put forward in principle. 
It is like placing before you a test paper. Whether this test 
can be done well depends on the cooperation and dedication of 
those who are present here today. In conclusion, I want to 
emphasize this point once again: Ours is a highly prestigious 
leading group. Therefore, it must also do a high-standard job. 
This is not only the demand of the municipal party committee 
and government but also the great expectations of the people of 
the whole municipality. I am convinced we will live up to their 
expections!

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhao Wei (6392 4850)] </F>
  [Text] Guangzhou, 8 Jun (XINHUA) -- The copyright 
management departments of Guangdong Province are taking vigorous 
measures to incorporate the import, production, and sale of 
copyrighted laser audio and video products into regular 
management to protect the legitimate rights and profits of 
copyright owners. 
  To harshly crack down on the piracy of laser audio and video 
products, Guangdong Province has screened the markets of laser 
audio and video products many times this year. A total of over 
140,000 illegal compact discs, 1,322 laser discs, and over 
100,000 audiotapes and videotapes were seized on 19 April alone. 
On 21 April, relevant departments openly destroyed some 63,000 
pieces of laser audio and video products. 
  The Copyright Department of the Guangdong Copyright Bureau 
recently revealed: Screening the market is only one of 
Guangdong's moves for protecting copyrights. The more important 
matter lies in strengthening the management of importing, 
sampling, and producing laser audio and video products. Three 
measures for strengthening their management are currently being 
taken: 
  -- Incorporting units engaged in duplicating into under 
management. The Audio and Video Management Department of 
Guangdong Provincial Press and Publications Bureau has conducted 
an overall investigation of the 23 production lines in the 
province and has put on file the quality, scales, and types of 
products of enterprises concerned as well as their ownership of 
copyrights, laying a good foundation for carrying out various 
management measures. 
  -- Setting up a copyright examination system. The provincial 
copyright bureau recently worked out the "Interim Procedures of 
Guangdong Province for Registering the Copyrights of Compact 
Discs," which stipulates that an enterprise must present a 
letter of authorization, a power of attorney, and other valid 
written documents concerning the copyright to the copyright 
department for examination whenever it wants to put one compact 
disc on the production line, and may start producing it after 
passing examination and receiving approval. 
  -- Introducing a licensing system for wholesalers and 
retailers. Strict examinations and control must be conducted 
over primary and secondary wholesalers; retailers must apply for 
permits before obtaining business licenses, and the permits 
shall be examined every year.

  [Text] Shenzhen, June 8 (CNS) -- The Communist Party of 
China (CPC) established the first Party branch in Shenzhen for 
230,000 individual entrepreneurs undertaking industry and 
commerce. The deputy head ofthe organizational department of 
the Shenzhen Municipal Party Committee, Mr. Lu Feng, said that 
such practice would be promoted across the municipality. 
  There are to date 56,400 industrial and commerical 
individual 
entities as well as privately owned enterprises in the 
municipality included in the taxation bracket. Privately run 
enterprises account for some 3,000 with 6,000 workers employed. 
Statistics showed that the number of individual business 
entities each with a registered capital of RMB 100,000 
[renminbi] was over 200. Some privately owned enterprises 
possessed registered capital of RMB 20 million with employment 
of 400 workers. Taxes paid by those individual business 
entities were up to RMB 736 million last year, ranking Shenzhen 
second only after Shanghai in terms of amount of taxes paid to 
the state. 
  Individual entrepreneurs vary as far as morals are 
concerned. 
However, most of them are honest and abide by law in running 
their business. Some individuals, however, are profit minded 
and seek benefit at the expense of others. They usually resort 
to tricks to do harm to consumers' interests. 
  The Yuanling market Party branch, first of such grassroots 
group of CPC set up in Shenzhen, has seven party members who are 
model individual entrepreneurs running business in the market. 
They observed professional ethical codes and abided by law 
during the past several years. They also did a lot for public 
welfare. 
  Establishment of such a CPC grassroots organization for 
individual entrepreneurs was of great significance to the 
strengthened leadership of the economic groups of nonpublic 
ownership, to the development of the special economic zone, to 
the proper market management and to social stability.

  [Text] Regional party committee Secretary Zhao Fulin 
carried out in-depth and conscientious investigations and study 
in Guilin City on 20-24 May, trying to explore new ways and 
means of revitalizing state-owned enterprises. 
  During his stay in Guilin, Zhao emphatically stated: 
State-owned enterprises should fully engage in market-oriented 
production, further tap latent potentialities, improve overall 
performance, and comprehensively raise economic efficiency. 
Over the last two years, Guilin City has energetically 
implemented a series of State Council regulations aimed at 
shifting operative mechanisms among industrial enterprises owned 
by the whole people, as well as all regional measures to this 
end, and carried out comprehensive enterprise reform in 35 
enterprises on a trial basis with the result that some eight 
enterprises have been omprehensively transformed while seven 
others have trial-implemented an input-output contract system. 
Besides, 10 enterprises have either adopted on a trial basis 
the operative mechanism pertaining to township and town 
enterprises or managed their production in exactly the same way 
as township and town enterprises do. More than 40 enterprises 
in the region have also reorganized themselves into joint-stock 
companies with limited liabilities or companies with limited 
liabilities. These reform measures have been implemented with 
an eye to shifting enterprise operative mechanism and have 
infused fresh vitality into the region's state-owned industrial 
enterprises. 
  Zhao fully affirmed Guilin's achievements with respect to 
reform and development in the last two years, saying: At 
present, we should make energetic efforts to push ahead with all 
types of reforms with a view to building a socialist market 
economic structure. Moreover, we should make continued efforts 
to delegate genuine operational decisionmaking powers to all 
enterprises, readjust industrial structures, improve the 
investment environment, invite more advanced foreign technology, 
step up cooperation with hinterland units, and absorb more 
foreign capital in order to accelerate technological 
transformation and new product development. 
  Speaking of revitalizing state-owned enterprises, Zhao 
emphatically noted: First and foremost, we should 
conscientiously implement and carry out a recent State Economic 
and Trade Commission decision on unfolding activities of 
shifting operative mechanisms, improving management, tapping 
latent potentialities, and increasing efficiency among all 
enterprises across the country. To this end, all enterprises in 
the region should earnestly carry out market-oriented 
production, tap latent potentialities, further deepen labor, 
personnel, and distribution systems reforms, and establish an 
effective profit-related incentive mechanism and an effective 
profit-related restriction mechanism. Only by tapping latent 
potentialities will state-owned enterprises be able to 
demonstrate bright development prospects. So long as they make 
continue efforts to develop more readily marketable new products 
and constantly improve product quality, state-owned enterprises 
will certainly achieve excellent economic efficency; second, we 
should strive to push ahead with property rights system reform, 
establish a modern enterprise system conformable to a market 
economy, capable of separating functions of the government from 
those of the enterprise, and characterized by clearly defined 
property rights, responsibilities and powers, and by scientific 
management as well, this being a fundamental way out for 
state-owned enterprises. Enterprise property rights system 
reform, Zhao noted, can take a variety of forms, including 
implementation of a joint-stock system. Apart from implementing 
a joint-stock system, we should also try to set up companies 
with limited liabilities and implement a joint-stock cooperative 
system, transfer property rights by establishing joint venture 
enterprises, merging enterprises, or establishing large groups 
of companies. We should declare bankrupt on a trial basis and 
in accordance with the law a number of long-standing loss-making 
enterprises with no hope of recovery and even publicly auction a 
number of long-standing loss-making small enterprises incapable 
of repaying their debts. Nevertheless, these reform measures, 
Zhao said, should be tried in light of actual conditions in the 
enterprises concerned. 
  Zhao also called for studying and working out reform 
measures 
suited to the region's specific enterprises in accordance with 
the state regulations concerned.

  [Excerpts] The two-day provincial meeting of 
administrative commissioners, mayors, and prefecture heads, 
which closed in Wuchang yesterday, studied, in a selective way, 
issues such as further implementing the gist of the speech Zhu 
Rongji made on handling official business on the spot in our 
province and managing state-owned enterprises well, and made a 
plan for reform of the province's grain purchasing and marketing 
structure. The meeting urged localities to actively raise 
funds, effectively run state-owned enterprises, and accelerate 
the province's economic development. Present at the meeting were 
Governor Jie Zhijie, Vice Governors Li Daqiang, Wang Shentie, 
Meng Qingping, Chen Shuiwen, and Su Xiaoyun, administrative 
commissioners and heads of all prefectures and autonomous 
prefectures, and mayors, and persons in charge of relevant 
departments directly under the jurisdiction of the provincial 
government. 
  The meeting held: Our province's current situation is very 
fine. 1.) Enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants for 
production has run unprecedentedly high; the area of land sown 
to grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops has expanded; and 
breakthrough advances have been made in the development of a 
diversified economy and township and town enterprises. The area 
of land sown to grain crops for the entire year is expected to 
amount to 72 million mu or so; that of land sown to cotton, 7.4 
million mu; and that of land sown to oil-bearing crops, about 15 
mullion mu, relatively big increases over the previous year. 
Currently, it is a forgone conclusion that we will have a 
bumper crop summer harvest. Early rice and cotton are coming 
alone fine. Supplies of agricultural means of production are 
relatively ample. 2.) There has been a big turn for the better 
in industrial development. By the end of April, an accumulated 
industrial output value of 50.284 billion yuan had been 
registered, an 18 percent increase over the same period last 
year, surpassing the nation's average level for the first time 
since 1985. Especially in April, the output value of the 
province's industrial enterprises at the county level and above 
amounted to 15.85 billion yuan, the highest monthly output value 
since the drive of reform and opening up to the outside world 
was carried out. In April, state-owned enterprises created 
9.293 billion yuan in output value, a rise of 12.2 percent over 
the corresponding period last year or an increase of 14 and 4.4 
percentage points respectively over the February and March 
growth rates, and an increase of 5 percentage point over the 
nation's state-owned enterprise growth level in the same period. 
3.) Urban and rural markets are prospering, commodity supplies 
are ample, and transactions are brisk. By the end of April, 
social consumer commodity retail sales volume totaled 19.279 
billion yuan, an increase of 19.9 percent over the same period 
last year. 4.) Various reforms have continued to deepen, and 
the province has opened wider to the outside world, thus 
vigorously promoting economic development. 
  The meeting pointed out: In the fine situation there do 
exist some difficulties and problems hampering development and 
stability, which should not be overlooked, such as that 
state-owned enterprises had strained circulating funds and 
difficult operations and an increase in the number of 
enterprises suspending production or operating under capacity 
and of loss-making enterprise. [passage omitted] 
  Continuing to regenerate enterprises which have suspended 
operation or are operating under capacity and loss-making 
enterprises and to invigorate state-owned enterprises is the key 
to the province's current economic work. Governments at all 
levels and various departments should pay close attention to 
managing state-owned enterprises well, which serve as a dragon's 
head in the province's development, and proceed to promote the 
development of the economy based on nonpublic ownership and 
township and town enterprises and maintain the sustained, rapid, 
and healthy development of Hubei's economy. 
  In a view of the current contradiction of fund strains, the 
meeting urged trying every possible means to raise funds, paying 
a great deal of attention to encouragement of saving deposits, 
utilizing foreign capital, and developing of projects covered by 
the state plan. [passage omitted] 
  The meeting maintained: We should simultaneously grasp fund 
revenue collection and its flexible use. At present, fund 
shortages are a problem. However, what is more important is the 
market problem. We should guide enterprises in gearing their 
production to market demands and help some enterprises reduce 
production and inventories and promote sales. [passage omitted] 
  Jie Zhijie, Li Daqiang, Meng Qingping, and Chen Shuiwen 
spoke at the meeting. In his speech, Jia Zhijie particularly 
stressed: Fundamental to run state-owned enterprises well being 
is to deepen reform. The goal of state-owned enterprise reform 
is to establish a modern enterprise system in accordance with 
the demands of the market economy so that enterprises will 
become genuine economic entities and main competition-oriented 
market players able to operate independently, assume full 
responsibility for their own profits and losses, and restrain 
and develop themselves. He said: Currently we should intensify 
reform, unswervingly implement the enterprise law and 
regulations, actively support the jointly decided selected 
projects, pay attention to organizational structural 
readjustment of state-owned enterprises, take the path of 
specialization and formation of groups, and enhance the quality 
of enterprises as a whole. [passage omitted] 
  Jia Zhijie urged governments at all levels and competent 
departments to effectively improve their work style, go down to 
enterprises to conduct investigation and study, give specific 
guidance, strive to improve the external environment of 
enterprises, and make vigorous efforts to implement policies and 
run state-owned enterprises well.

political and ideological work held its 8th annual meeting 
marking the 10th anniversary of its founding and of the

government leaders Chen Bangzhu [provincial governor], Yang 
Zhengwu, Liu Fusheng, and Liu Zheng wrote inscriptions 
congratulating the meeting. 
  At the meeting, Wen Xuande pointed out: The principle of 
enterprise ideological and political work is adherence to the 
policy of doing two types of work simultaneously, attaching 
equal importance to both, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guide and 
economic construction as the center, to train new socialist 
people who have lofty ideals, moral integrity, education, and a 
sense of discipline. When discussing the methods with which to 
improve enterprise ideological and political work, he said: It 
is necessary to lay great stress on the priority of matters by 
encouraging adoption of concrete methods to solve concrete 
matters, on keeping abreast of the developments of the times and 
life and getting close to the masses of people and not [words 
indistinct], and on the urgency of matters, and to watch out for 
symptoms of unhealthy tendencies and solve them in the embryonic 
stage and lay stress on practical results, carrying out work 
down to the grass-roots units and helping the masses of people 
solve practical problems. 
  At the meeting, experiences in enterprise ideological and 
political work were summed and exchanged, and a number of 
outstanding enterprises, societies for study of workers' 
political and ideological work, and workers in enterprise 
ideological and political work. The meeting also elected a new

political and ideological work, with Chu Bo as the first 
president, Wen Xuande, Zhou Bohua, and Zhou Texin as presidents, 
Liu Zheng and six others as advisers, and Liu Zhiping and 12 
others as vice presidents.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Sichuan To Sell Dozen State-Owned </F>
Enterprises By End of This Month"] 
  [Text] Chengdu, 7 Jun (LIEN HO PAO) -- Sichuan Province 
has decided to sell 10-15 state-owned enterprises to foreign 
firms at the "International Seminar on Sichuan's Opening Up to 
the Outside World Investment Forum," which will be held on 26 
June. At present, 33 enterprises have been selected from 
Chengdu, Chongqing, Deyang, Mianyang, Leshan, Zigong, and 
Neijiang to make preparations. 
  Differing from sales of loss-making enterprises in other 
localities, the enterprises for sale have good economic returns. 
Profitable enterprises account for 84.8 percent of the total, 
and the rest have great potential. These enterprises are 
engaged in machinery, electronics, metallurgy, chemical 
industry, construction materials, food, medicine, light 
industry, and textiles, and they have broad market prospects. 
This feature has been praised by foreign businessmen. 
  According to information, Sichuan wants to adopt five sales 
methods: First, sell all of the property rights and land use 
rights; second, according to the requirements of the buyer, sell 
part of the property rights and land use rights; third, on 
condition that the buyer makes arrangements for the workers, 
sell all of the property rights and land use rights; fourth, on 
condition that the buyer makes arrangements for some of the 
workers, sell part of the property rights and land use rights; 
and fifth, transfer state shares and corporate shares to 
joint-stock companies.

  [Text] The song and dance ensemble of the political 
department of the Tibetan Regional People's Armed Police Corps 
[TRPAPC] put on a cultural and art performance at the Tibetan 
People's Hall on the evening of 7 June. Chen Kuiyuan, Raidi,

department, and judicial, procuratorial, and public security 
organs, took time off their busy schedule to watch the 
performance. Other TRPAPC leaders and more than 1,000 armed 
police officers and men stationed in Lhasa also watched the show. 
  The brilliant performance featured dances entitled: Emotions 
of Parting, Ode to the Snow Lotus, On the Tea Delivery Path, and 
Footsteps to the Police Camp, and other programs reflecting the 
highland-based armed police officers and men's sensational 
fighting spirit in taking a foothold on the borderland and

taking on dangers when fighting enemies; and harmonious 
relations between the police and the people. In addition, 
traditional folk cultural and art programs such as Sausage or 
Shoe, Lovers Under the Moon, (Arxie), and A True Man of Flesh 
and Blood, expressing the Tibetan nation's spiritual aspects, 
natural conditions and social customs, and working life were 
performed. Revolutionary songs such as Chairman Mao Zedong 
Sends People Here and popular army songs such as Telling You My 
Innermost Thoughts and Feelings, Devote My Deep Love to the 
Great Party, Song of Praise for the Heroes, and The Long Great 
Wall, added a passionate atmosphere to the performance. These 
cultural and art programs were put together by the TRPAPC 
political department's song and dance ensemble after two months 
of rehearsal which formally began on 21 April. 
  After the show, Chen Kuiyuan, Raidi, Guo Jinlong, and other 
regional leaders walked onto the stage and cordially shook hands 
with all performers and stage workers, and extended their 
congratulations.

  [Text] The seventh session of the Standing Committee of 
the eighth provincial people's congress held its third plenary 
session yesterday afternoon, presided over by Congress Standing 
Committee Chairman Yin Jun. The plenary session listened to 
Governor He Zhiqiang's report on the Yunnan provincial 
delegation's visit to Cambodia, Thailand, and Burma. 
  In his report, after briefing the current session on the 
visit, the governor said: A rare opportunity has emerged for 
Yunnan to conduct economic cooperation with Cambodia, Thailand, 
Burma, and the rest of Southeast Asia. With its geographical 
conditions and existing influence, the province has relative 
strong points for expanding cooperation with these countries and 
the region. He said: To seize the opportunity, to bring the 
strong points into play, expand cooperation, and accelerate 
development in the days to come, we should further unify our 
thinking and steps. In light of the development of the 
situation and their own conditions, all localities and units 
should earnestly study and make plans for work with foreign 
countries, genuinely focus work on Southeast Asia and South 
Asia, and make great efforts to create conditions to develop 
trade in a larger-scale sense, turn border trade into part and 
parcel of the province's trade with other countries, and enter 
the large-scale, higher-grade markets of the vast areas of the 
province's neighboring countries and third countries with their 
products. In terms of the province's economic and trade 
relations with its neighboring countries and the Southeast Asian 
and South Asian regions, while developing trade with them, we 
should gradually develop the export-oriented processing 
industries with stress on expanding economic and technological 
cooperation, speed up the pace of establishing an 
export-oriented economy and take measures and create conditions 
to help enterprises and companies whose conditions are ripe to 
go abroad for greater access to the Southeast and South Asian 
markets in extensive cooperation with enterprises run by the 
state, collectives, and individuals. We should change 
small-scale, fragmental, and scattered primary modes of 
operation and initially foster a number of effective and 
financially strong group companies, set up enterprises and do 
more business in the surrounding countries, bring the strong 
points into play for the long term, carry out contracting 
business with some countries in specific items of cooperation, 
bring Kunming's role as a central city into full play so that it 
will become a newly rising city which has extensive economic 
ties, a certain position, and some strength in Southeast Asia. 
  He Zhiqiang said: We should put construction of an 
international thoroughfare to Southeast Asia in the forefront 
and actively carry out cooperation with neighboring countries, 
with the focus on the cooperative exploitation of natural 
resources, and at the same time, accelerate the reform of the 
foreign trade, foreign economic cooperation, and financial 
structures, and create conditions for expanding cooperation with 
foreign countries. 
  After hearing He Zhiqiang's report, Yin Jun said: The He 
Zhiqiang-led delegation's visit to three Southeast Asian 
countries was a success. It will play an important role in 
further consolidating and developing the province's friendship 
with the three countries and accelerating exchange and 
cooperation with them. The visit has enabled us to have a 
correct understanding of our province's strong points and a 
greater sense of urgency, to better seize the opportunity, open 
wider to the outside world, and promote our province's economic 
development. He said: According to the plan of the provincial 
party committee, people's congresses at all levels should speed 
up the pace of legislation, exercise effective supervision, and 
create a better environment and conditions for our province's 
opening up to the outside world, and particularly, for promoting 
exchanges and cooperation with neighboring countries.
