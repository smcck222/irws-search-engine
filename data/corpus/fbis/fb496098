  [Text] Shanghai, June 15 (XINHUA) -- The stocks listed in 
the Hong Kong stock market by nine Chinese mainland state 
enterprises are eagerly sought after by investors. 
  These enterprises have raised 11.385 billion Hong Kong 
dollars by issuing 5.551 billion shares since July last year 
when they were first listed in Hong Kong. 
  This figure made up four percent of the total overseas 
investment in the Chinese Mainland last year. 
  These enterprises include the Qingdao Brewery, the Shanghai 
Petrochemical Works, the Beiren Printing Machinery Plant, the 
Anhui Maanshan Iron and Steel Complex, the Yizheng Chemical 
Works and the Tianjin Bohai Chemical Works. 
  According to experts here from Hong Kong's market, the 
reason 
why the "H"-shares are popular in Hong Kong is because these 
mainland enterprises, which are backed by government policy, 
have valuable property and their products have a ready market. 
  It was learned that 22 additional mainland enterprises are 
expected to get listed in the Hong Kong market this year.

"Resorting to Deception in Statistical Work Can Never Be 
Allowed"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 13 Jun (XINHUA) -- The nationwide 
inspection of the enforcement of the statistics law has begun. 
The inspection not only has great significance for ensuring the 
state's scientific decisions and modern management, but will 
also definitely make great contributions to laying a legal 
foundation for the country's statistical work. 
  Since the "Statistics Law" was promulgated and put into 
force 
more than a decade ago, statistical work has played an 
increasingly important role in the country's 
macro-decisionmaking and macroeconomic regulation and control. 
This year is an important one for building a socialist market 
economic system. Following the implementation of a series of 
major reform measures, some interest setups formed in the past 
have changed and many problems have arisen as a result of the 
readjustments of interests. Therefore, the situation demands 
that we build a macroeconomic regulation and control system in 
line with the development of the market economy as soon as 
possible, and strive to refine the system. The basic function 
of statistical work is to conduct statistical surveys and 
analyses of economic and social development to faithfully 
reflect the actual situation; and to provide objective, 
accurate, and reliable information for making scientific 
decisions and for formulating macroeconomic regulation and 
control measures. 
  According to information provided by the State Statistics 
Bureau, over the last few years, the nation's important 
statistical data as a whole has objectively reflected the trends 
and changes in the nation's economic performance and has 
basically been accurate. However, it must be pointed out that 
individual localities, departments, and some units have a poor 
understanding of the statistics law; some of them have even 
ignored it and falsified statistical data. In particular, they 
have resorted to deception in preparing indicators that reflect 
their work performance -- radically violating the party's 
ideological line of seeking truth from facts, damaging the 
party's good traditions and style, and disturbing reform, 
opening up, and the development of the socialist market economy. 
If this mistake of extreme egoism and regional protectionism is 
allowed to spread, the country's scientific decisions and 
macroeconomic regulation and control are bound to lose reliable 
ground, which will have a disastrous affect on the healthy 
development of the nation's economy. 
  People in economic circles have pointed out: Currently, the 
prominent characteristic of fraudulent practice in statistical 
work is to use falsified data to win either personal or a small 
group's political honor and to favor their economic interests. 
For instance, to show their "work performance," the leaders of 
a certain county asked their agriculture bureau to increase 
peasants' per-capita net income from 188 yuan to 204 yuan. But, 
when they learned that the higher authorities had decided to 
treat counties in which peasants' per-capita net income was less 
than 200 yuan as counties eligible to receive impoverishment 
relief aid, they again asked the statistics and agriculture 
bureau to change the per-capita net income to 183 yuan and 
submit it to departments concerned in order to be awarded an 
impoverishment relief fund. In another example, in an attempt 
to make their county the province's first to double its total 
industrial and agricultural output value, the leaders of a 
certain county fabricated a string of figures for announcement 
by the news media, causing a very bad influence. 
  Fraudulent practice in statistical work is by no means an 
ordinary violation of discipline in economic life -- its 
damaging and corroding effects are extremely serious. When 
commenting on this matter, a leader of the National People's 
Congress Standing Committee seriously pointed out that we must 
have adequate understanding of the serious damage caused to 
society by this law-violating act, and that we should 
unrelentingly investigate cases of this kind. A person in 
charge of the State Council stressed: The news media should 
timely expose cases that have caused a bad influence. We should 
educate a large number of people with each case exposed. We 
should respect facts at any time and under any circumstances -- 
this is the fundamental principle our party has always upheld, 
our party's lifeline. We can expect that, through the current 
inspection of enforcement of the statistics law, new progress 
will be made in laying a legal foundation for the country's 
statistical work.

  [Text] Shengyang, June 13 (XINHUA) -- China will pay more 
attention to cracking down on major economic crimes in its 
anti-corruption struggle. 
  Hou Zongbin, deputy secretary of the Central Commission for 
Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China, said this 
during his inspection in northeast China's Liaoning Province on 
June 6-13. 
  Hou pointed out that the party's struggle against economic 
crimes is a serious political struggle and has no room for 
compromise. 
  He urged all departments in charge of discipline inspection 
and supervision to make as much headway as possible in dealing 
with economic crimes within a short period of time. 
  He also asked all party leaders and members and government 
officials to shoulder responsibility for the work while working 
hard for reform and opening to the outside world. 
  The discipline inspection and supervision organs should 
positively cooperate with judicial organs in the current 
struggle, he said. 
  Economic crimes involving leaders above county level should 
be dealt with resolutely, he stressed.

<F P=106> [By Ma Zhiping: "New Foreign Investment Down by 50 Percent"] </F>
  [Text] The growth of foreign-funded businesses in China is 
slowing down due to State policy readjustments and keen 
competition from neighbouring countries for outside capital, 
said the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC). 
  The number of newly established foreign-funded enterprises 
was 10,739 in the first quarter of this year, down 43.6 percent 
compared to the same period last year. 
  There was also a 50 percent drop in new foreign investment 
and registered capital, according to the latest SAIC statistics. 
  "The introduction of a new taxation system, which cuts down 
preferential tax treatment for foreign-funded ventures, is a 
major factor affecting new foreign investment," said Hou Lin, 
head of the Enterprise Registration Department of SAIC. 
  Other policy readjustments, such as the suspension of 
duty-free import of foreign cars by foreign-funded firms in 
China, and the increasing competition among industries vying for 
foreign funds also played a part. 
  Two other factors also contributed to the slowdown. The 
first are the preferential policies adopted by some nearby Asian 
countries to attract foreign investments, and the second is the 
tightened economic control designed to cut down the scale of 
capital investment. 
  "The slowdown in the growth of foreign-funded firms is 
normal 
and it is good that the State standardizes foreign firms and 
joint ventures and improves their management in China," Hou said. 
  He added that the rapid growth of foreign-funded firms in 
the 
past two years saw some unhealthy practices. 
  For example, bogus joint ventures had been set up to take 
advantage of Chinese preferential policies. 
  A small increase in the number of foreign-funded firms was 
reported in. Beijing, Jilin and Tibet Autonomous Region. 
However, the number plunged by more than 50 percent in 12 
provinces and regions including Jiangsu, Shandong, Zhejiang, 
Hainan and Hunan. 
  About 70 percent of the foreign investment went to the 
industrial sector while investment in real estate, public 
utility projects and consultancy services is cooling. 
  The number of joint ventures decreased by 50 percent in the 
first quarter but the number of foreignowned firms rose by 6 
percent, according to SAIC statistics. 
  There were a total of 167,000 overseas-funded businesses in 
the country by the end of last year.

<F P=106> [Article: "State Pursues More Working Capital for Public </F>
Firms"] 
  [Text] A shortage of working capital has recently become 
acute at many State-owned enterprises. 
  At a recent seminar organized by China Financial Times on 
the 
issue, government officials, financial experts and businessmen 
concluded that the solution depends on changing the way State 
enterprises operate. 
  Bank loans have been the main support behind enterprises' 
operations ever since the government stopped earmarking working 
capital, according to China Financial Times. 
  Most enterprises accumulate little for working capital. 
Nationwide, the average percentage of enterprises with 
self-supplied funds for working capital fell from 25 percent in 
1984 to only 7 percent last year. 
  For normal operations, an enterprise should generate at 
least 
30 percent of its working capital, according to Liu Zigang, an 
official with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). 
  When bank loans are in short supply, such enterprises 
experience hard times. 
  It is a heavy burden for the banks to provide large amounts 
of working capital for enterprises. 
  According to Liu, ICBC provides 80 percent of the working 
capital extended by financial organization. 
  In 1992, the bank's loans for working capital rose by 67.2 
billion yuan ($7.7 billion) compared with the previous year. 
Last year, it rose by 1O2.4 billion yuan ($11.8 billion). By 
the end of this April, the increase totalled 20.3 billion yuan 
($2.3 billion), 10.3 billion ($1.2 billion) more than in the 
same period last year. 
  But the demand for working capital rises even more rapidly. 
  Inflation has caused increases in the enterprises' 
production 
costs, so demand increased for working capital. 
  Chain debts also take a large part of the enterprises' 
working capital. Large uncollected accounts at many firms force 
them to delay payments to their own creditors. 
  During the first quarter of this year, the total owed by the 
40,000 enterprises which have accounts at the Industrial and 
Commercial Bank increased by more than 40 billion yuan ($4.6 
billion), compared with the same period last year, according to 
Liu. 
  Many enterprises have not invested enough for their 
construction projects, so funds earmarked for working capital 
usually are diverted to fixed assets to pay for the con 
struction. 
  For construction completed between 1992 and 1993, diverted 
funds totalled at least 67 billion yuan ($7.7 billion ). 
  According to Su Zongguo, an official with the State Economy 
and Trade Commission (SETC), there will be a gap of at least 50 
billion yuan ($5.75 billion) between demand and supply for 
working capital required by industrial enteprises this year. 
  Because of this shortage, many enterprises may have strong 
sales, but lack funds to purchase raw materials to produce more 
goods. 
  The government has decided to adopt different measures to 
solve the problem. Major enterprises with bright prospects that 
have used their capital properly will be assured of government 
support. 
  Enterprises in poor financial shape but striving to improve 
their operations will receive loans. Enterprises considered 
hopeless will be allowed to go bankrupt. 
  To do this, it is essential to categorize enterprises with 
great care, says Hu Huanxin from the Agricultural Bank of China. 
  The total investment in fixed assets should be firmly 
controlled, said Su. New projects should only be approved after 
they have raised enough funds so that no working capital will be 
diverted. 
  Chain debts will be monitored by the SETC to free working 
capital. Analysis has already begun with major industrial 
enterprises that work with raw materials, power, and machinery. 
  The enterprises' reliance on bank loans should be reduced 
through an increase in self-supplied working capital, said Liu 
Zigang. And the State should increase investments in major 
industrial enterprises through lower tax rates, and tax rebates. 
  Banks should set aside loans to be used exclusively as 
working capital. Sales income from enterprises should be placed 
in banks' special accounts and earmarked for use as working 
capital. 
  Supervision of bank loans to be used for working capital 
should be strengthened through a regulatory system, so that 
these funds could be used more efficiently. This can be one way 
to ease the shortage of working capital, suggests Yao Jiqi from 
the Bank of China. 
  Within the corporate system, government enterprises now can 
raise money by issuing stocks and bonds. 
  To help transform their operations, the SETC has started to 
experiment with more than 10,000 enterprises in 10 cities. 
  The results will be reviewed at the end of the Eighth 
Five-Year period (1991-95).

  [Text] Beijing, June 13 (XINHUA) -- China has decided to 
become more active on world market to increase coal exports in 
the next few years. 
  Jing Tianliang, president of the China National Coal 
Industry 
Import and Export Corp. (CNCIE), said that China's coal export 
this year is expected to exceed 20.2 million tons, hitting a new 
record. 
  By 2000, he said, China's coal export is estimated to be 
more 
than 30 million tons. 
  Jing's company, specializing in handling coal exports, was 
founded in 1982, when only about 6.4 million tons of Chinese 
coal was sold abroad. However, China's coal exports have since 
increased by an average 1.4 million tons, or ten percent, each 
year to reach 20.2 million tons in 1992. 
  The aggregate export in those ten years amounted to 160 
million tons, worth more than 5.9 billion U.S. dollars, Jing 
said. 
  However, Jing termed such a volume as "inappropriate to 
China's status as the world's leading coal producer". In 1993 
China's coal production stood at 1.14 billion tons, ranking 
first in the world, its exports accounted for only 1.6 percent; 
the coal trade volume in the world the same year was nearly 420 
million tons, China had a barely 4.5 percent market share. 
  Under these circumstances, Jing said, China should join in 
the competition in the world market to enhance its profile. 
This will contribute to the development of China's coal 
industry, as well as its economic growth, he added. 
  The domestic coal market remains stagnant while the demand 
on 
the world market is beginning to revive. From January to May 
this year CNCIE exported 8.6 million tons of coal, which Jiang 
said was an encouraging sign. 
  Market analysts predicted a reasonable increase in coal 
demand around the world, especially in Asia, in the coming 
years. This will push prices up, they said. 
  CNCIE said it would carry out a multi-polarized export 
strategy and make use of flexible trade methods. "We will try 
every method as long as it helps to increase coal exports; we 
will be open and equal to every customer, whether new or old," 
Jing said. 
  The corporation has won the confidence of customers in 
nearly 
20 countries and regions, including Japan, South Korea, France 
and Italy. Its exports are conducted mainly through long-term 
contractual trade, with Asia being its principal market target. 
  Jing said his company will work jointly with modern 
coalmines 
such as Datong, Pingshuo, Yanzhou and Zaozhuang, which are 
prominent among other things in terms of mining conditions and 
economic efficiency, to build coal export bases. 
  For example, he said, the coal mined in Yanzhou, in east 
China's Shandong Province, is famous for its good quality, low 
ash and sulphur contents and high caloric value. 
  However, he acknowledged that China still has a long way to 
go before it can catch up with the world's leading coal 
exporters such as Australia, the United States, South Africa and 
Canada. 
  "We must raise coal quality, improve transportation, port 
storage and ship loading, and harmonize every link in the chain 
from coal production to export, so as to make China's coal more 
competitive on the world market," he said.

<F P=106> [By Yun He: "Farm-Machine Sales Dive, Losses Pile Up"] </F>
  [Text] China's farm machinery industry is suffering record 
operational losses, according to the Ministry of Machinery 
Industry. 
  So far this year manufacturers of farm machinery have lost 
more than 106 million yuan ($12.2 million) because of slow sales. 
  Officials with the ministry's information and statistics 
bureau said that during the first five months of this year the 
industry's output was valued at more than 17.3 billion yuan ($2 
billion) or 34.5 percent of the year's target of 50 billion yuan 
($5.75 billion). 
  However, they added, the production growth was 13.1 percent 
less than the same period last year. 
  At the same time, sales have fallen 24.6 per cent from a 
year 
earlier. 
  The ministry's analysts say the industry's products simply 
are not competitive. 
  Because the prices of farm machines have risen under the 
government's new tax system, farmers prefer to fix up their old 
machines or even do farmwork by hand. 
  Sales of the industry's mainstay products -- such as large 
and medium-sized tractors, engines, combine harvesters and water 
pumps -- have all dropped from last year. The worst hit are 
combine harvesters, whose sales have fallen by half. 
  Government officials have started to show signs of worry 
that 
the slow sales may hinder agricultural production this year. 
  Although some machines are already too expensive for 
farmers, 
some manufacturers want to raise prices even further. They 
argue that higher prices are justified by higher costs, chiefly 
more expensive production materials and greater tax burdens. 
  The high price of diesel oil is another reason farmers are 
not buying machinery. A ton of oil now costs more than 1,453 
yuan ($167), up 365 yuan ($42) from last year. 
  In Jilin Province, one of the country's major grain 
producers, so many farmers are doing their work manually that 
the amount of farmland ploughed by machine has shrunk to 1.2 
million hectares, 27.7 per cent less than in 1991. 
  There is an exception to the dismal market, however. The 
Ministry of Machinery Industry says that factories in Shanxi 
Province are selling 45.2 percent more farm machinery than last 
year. The reason is simple: They are concentrating their 
production on the simple and inexpensive two-wheel tractors, 
which are very popular among Shanxi's farmers.

  [Text] Beijing, 12 Jun (XINHUA) -- Bo Yibo, honorary 
chairman for the "In-Depth Travel for Economic Efficiency in 
China" activity, wrote a letter to the "In-Depth Travel for 
Economic Efficiency in China" Activity Guidance Committee and 
the "In-Depth Travel for Economic Efficiency in China" Activity 
Publicizing Committee on 11 June, in which he called on them to 
pay attention to investigations and studies, and publicize the 
role of improved economic efficiency in promoting and ensuring 
stability. The text of the letter reads: 
  To the Activity Guidance Committee and the Activity 
Publicizing Committee of the "In-Depth Travel for Economic 
Efficiency in China": 
  Recently, you have launched an all-out effort to publicize 
the importance of raising economic efficiency, doing a great 
deal of work in spreading awareness of efficiency, and in 
fostering the efficiency concept. Your activities have elicited 
a strong reaction from society. I would like to congratulate 
and thank you! 
  Stability is a prerequisite for reform and development. 
Raising efficiency is the foundation for maintaining stability. 
Only by genuinely raising efficiency can we avoid serious 
unevenness in our economic development and can we ensure a 
stress-free environment for reform; only by genuinely raising 
efficiency can we truly upgrade our national strength, truly 
improve the people's living standards, and truly ensure social 
stability. I hope the comrades responsible for "in-dept travel 
for economic efficiency in China" activities will conduct 
further investigations, studies, and propaganda to determine the 
inherent relationship among deepening reform, raising 
efficiency, and maintaining stability. In this way, you will be 
able to render better service to reform, development, and 
stability. 
  I hope you will achieve still greater achievements in your 
activities!

<F P=106> [Interview with Li Tieying, member of the State Council, </F>
minister-chairman of the State Commission for Restructuring the 
Economy, and member of the Communist Party Central Committee 
Politburo, by Peter Kasalovsky and Jaroslav Brabec in Beijing on 
20 May: "China Is Making Progress, But It Is Not Competing"] 
  [Text] During the recent research visit by HOSPODARSKE 
NOVINY editors to the People's Republic of China, Chief Editor 
Dr. Peter Kasalovsky was received by Li Tieying, a member of the 
PRC State Council, minister-chairman of the State Commission for 
Restructuring the Economy, and member of the PRC Communist Party 
Central Committee Politburo. On this occasion, Li Tieying 
granted our daily an interview on the issues affecting China's 
economic development, its economic reforms, and cooperation with 
Central and Eastern Europe. 
  [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] The 21st century is considered to be 
the century of China. If the trends do not change, during its 
first quarter, China should -- according to the forecasts -- 
achieve overall a gross domestic product of the level of the 
United States. Do you think that this is a realistic forecast? 
  [Li] These observations, being made in the West, seem 
exaggerated to us. In any case, China is not governed by any 
competition. We simply want to advance the economic and social 
level of the Chinese people, to eradicate the centuries-long 
backwardness of the country, and to improve its standard of 
living. Now, for example, we have set ourselves the task of 
eliminating poverty from our country by the end of the century. 
Some 80 million people -- mostly in the mountainous regions and 
the areas severely affected by drought -- still live in poverty 
in our country. 
  [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] That is a modest reply. Some powers 
give the impression that they would like to slow down or at 
least check China's economic boom by means of secondary issues 
and internal instability. Do you not think that this stems from 
their fear of Chinese competition in the economic and political 
spheres? 
  [Li] China is a large country. It plays an important role 
in the world. It is necessary to regard China's economic 
progression and social progress as a major contribution to the 
world's peaceful development. From the historical point of 
view, China has always been a peace-loving country. An 
economically strong China will also remain a guarantee of peace 
in the world. It will never strive for hegemony. It will never 
interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. 
Naturally, it will oppose activities that interfere in Chinese 
internal affairs. Owing to their long-term efforts from the 
time of the opium wars in the middle of the last century, the 
Chinese people finally rose up, founded a republic, and are 
scoring successes. The common goal of the 1,200 million Chinese 
is to develop multilaterally the Chinese nation and to work for 
the country's prosperity in order to improve its standard of 
living and culture. It is impossible to frustrate this goal. 
  [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] Internal stability is a condition for 
reform policy and economic development. In recent years, 
however, China has given the impression that it must struggle 
again and again for economic balance and social stability. Do 
you think that the reason for this is the headlong development, 
or rather the tedious transition from a planned to a market 
economy? 
  [Li] Our reform concerns the essence of the system, the 
whole process of management. Therefore, we consider this reform 
to be a second revolution. As far as its dimensions are 
concerned, it reaches into the people's overall economic 
activity and living conditions. We think that the reform steps 
have to be implemented under the conditions of internal and 
social stability. It is difficult to develop the economy in an 
uneasy political atmosphere and it is impossible to reform its 
management. It is obvious that one should not build a 
skyscraper on tectonically very active ground. It is also not 
possible to reform the management of the economic system in an 
uneasy society. We are concentrating all our efforts on 
economic construction. This is the center of our endeavor's 
gravity. Now and for the future -- as long as nothing 
fundamental that could divert us from this task occurs in the 
world. 
  [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] Do you view the progress of the Chinese 
economy, which can be expressed in automobile terminology as 
"stop and go," as a consequence of making rapid progress or of 
the slow course of reform? The supporters of shock reform 
consider the main problems of the Chinese economy to be the 
aftermath of slow reform changes. 
  [Li] The economy develops in cycles in all countries. A 
cycle is a typical form of economic development in capitalist 
countries. We also had an economic cycle in the past under rigid 
planned management. I do not mean to infer that the economic 
problems could not also be caused by our mistakes. Moreover, in 
the transition from a planned to a market economy, many 
phenomena that we are still not very familiar with are cropping 
up. The issue of the cycle in the construction of a social 
market economy is still the subject of research. A major boom 
has occurred in our economy after 15 years of reform. Now we 
have the fastest pace of development in China's history. 
  Japan, and later other Asian countries, experienced a 
similar 
boom and problems after World War II. In our country, reform 
has been responsible for the rapid growth. The rapid progress 
in recent years, however, has also contributed to overheating 
the economy. Some factors -- such as energy and raw materials or 
communications and the transportation infrastructure -- cannot 
keep pace with this economic temperature. 
  [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] Economic progress, however, was also 
responsible for the disparate development of the Chinese 
regions, for the unequal partnership between the eastern 
provinces and the central and western provinces of China. The 
self-confidence of the rich regions has increased, and this has 
provoked a limited willingness along the seaboard to return to 
the rest of China the resources that it put into the special 
economic zones and the whole of the east. This is the logic of 
a market economy that reproduces wealth, but is reluctant to 
give it up. Will administrative measures and the attractiveness 
of the raw-material resources in the poorer provinces be enough 
to resolve the problem, or will it be necessary to prepare for 
more serious political and migration problems? 
  [Li] The disparate development between the west and east of 
China is indeed a serious issue. It has come to the forefront 
of the attention of China's leading bodies. For example, this 
year we have introduced new reform measures in the spheres of 
taxation and investment preferences for the poorer regions. We 
want to extend wealth from the east to the west of our country. 
More recently, the central government has consolidated 60 
percent of all tax receipts. We are beginning to make more 
significant investments in energy, the transportation network, 
and the raw material base in Central and Western China where 
great natural wealth is to be found. We are trying to increase 
cooperation between the rich eastern and less developed western 
provinces and we are supporting the tendency of domestic and 
foreign companies to invest more in the west. We are striving 
to ensure that this is advantageous for them. 
  [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] Practice indicates that this is a 
complex process. 
  [Li] It will take a long time to adjust this difference, 
perhaps whole decades, because the eastern provinces are also 
not standing still. 
  [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] Moreover, the wealthy provinces are not 
willing to give up their dominant economic position. 
  [Li] We can make use of the state enterprises that still 
predominate in our industry for this task. 
  [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] They also have their problems. At the 
moment, China suffers from relatively low unemployment; compared 
with our small country with its 15-percent unemployment rate, 
for example. In the process of transferring to a market 
economy, how do you intend to resolve in China, with its huge 
population potential, the problem of mass unemployment that a 
market economy inevitably brings? 
  [Li] We already have this problem. We are combating it by 
creating a labor market and a social security system. The new 
economic system must have mechanisms for changes in the labor 
force and coping with unemployment. In the cities, we are 
developing, on a broad scale, individual and private sectors 
that create new jobs. In the country, we are expanding in 
particular the tertiary and secondary sectors -- the so-called 
rural industry. Rural industry already has 25 million 
enterprises. It catches the labor force let go in agriculture. 
Some 110 million former farmers have already found work this 
way. A further 6 million were added to this number last year. 
Another 160-200 million farmers will find work before the end 
of the century in the services and rural industry spheres. 
Chinese experiences in this regard are important for all 
developing states, because they reveal how to industrialize the 
country and, at the same time, improve agriculture. Our task is 
to develop rural industry and to establish thousands and 
thousands of little towns and communities so that the laid-off 
labor force from the countryside does not engulf the large 
cities. In China we are now modernizing the villages and 
industrializing agriculture. 
  [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] The political changes in Central and 
Eastern Europe have greatly reduced the level of economic and 
political relations between these countries and China. In your 
view, what are the prospects for these relations in the near and 
more distant future? 
  [Li] It should not be a problem to increase the level of 
relations. Your pen may also help to build a new bridge. There 
is traditional friendship between China and the former Soviet 
Union and the Eastern European countries. At the start of our 
republic's development, both the former Soviet Union and the 
Eastern European countries -- including Czechoslovakia -- gave 
us a great deal of assistance, including major investment 
deliveries and training experts. In the late 1950's, I myself 
graduated from the Charles University Faculty of Mathematics and 
Physics in Prague. The Chinese people are grateful to you for 
this support. They harbor profound emotional ties toward the 
former socialist countries and will never forget their 
help. 
  The Chinese people and the Chinese Government fully 
respect the changes that have occurred in the former USSR and 
Eastern Europe. The Slovak people have a right to choose their 
own political system and way of life. As old friends, we are 
monitoring the developments in Slovakia with great attention and 
interest. We would be happy to see economic growth and 
stability in your country and your people's prosperity. There 
is a great deal of scope for cooperation. We can complement 
each other economically. We have traditional ties of friendship 
at our disposal. There are no historical disputes between us. 
I think, therefore, that it is not only possible, but also 
essential to boost cooperation between China and your part of 
the world. 
  However, it is impossible to overlook the fact that major 
changes have occurred in our economic system. These make closer 
cooperation possible by the means normal throughout the world. 
The recent visit by our premier, Li Peng, to four of the former 
USSR's Central Asian countries is an example of this. In our 
view, all countries, whether large or small, strong or weak, 
have a right to participate in equal international cooperation. 
They have a right to choose their own social system and way of 
life. We are against intervening in the internal affairs of 
other countries. All countries in the world must live in peace. 
Economic relations must be based on equality and mutual 
advantageousness. There are more than 180 states in the world 
and approximately 3,000 peoples. The world is multifarious, 
each country has its own specific history and culture and 
specific geographic conditions, and they all have to respect 
each other. It is impossible to force a single view or single 
model on countries. Variety and diversity are manifestations of 
human civilization. 
  China is a large country with a rapidly growing economy. 
Even if we become economically strong, we will not intervene in 
the internal affairs of other states. We will not strive for 
world domination. We are at the end of one century and we will 
soon enter into another. We must bring a peaceful, developing 
world into the next century. All forward-looking politicians 
must strive for this.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of speech by Chen Jinhua, minister of the State </F>
Planning Commission, at National Meeting on General Inspection 
of Commodity Prices; date and place not given: "Continue To Do 
a Good Job of the General Inspection of Commodity Prices"] 
  [Text] Progress and Main Achievements Made in the 
Nationwide General Inspection of Commodity Prices 
  In early March this year, the State Council decided to 
launch 
a nationwide general inspection of commodity prices in the wake 
of the in-depth development of the reform and the enforcement of 
the macroeconomic regulation and control. This is an important 
step which we have taken toward inhibiting inflation in 
consideration of the general interests of reform, development, 
and stability. By following the State Council's policy 
decision, the general inspection of commodity prices has scored 
initial results across the country over the past two months or 
so. The following are some main achievements: 
  1. A deeper understanding has been gained of the 
necessity to exercise regulation and control of prices under 
market economy conditions. During the general inspection 
of commodity prices, the State Planning Commission and the 
Propaganda Department have organized a propaganda campaign 
through the mass media with the main theme of deepening reform, 
intensifying regulation and control, and advancing the wholesome 
development of the market. We have widely publicized and 
elaborated on several viewpoints through the news media. For 
instance, the view that the decontrol of prices does not mean 
the completion of reform, laissez-faire policies should not be 
applied to the market prices, and the creation of the price 
mechanism through the market requires the deepening of reform in 
various aspects; and the view that the establishment of a sound 
price regulation and control system is an important part of the 
shaping of a socialist market economic structure. By 
systematically publicizing and implementing all the price 
regulation and control measures, the party and the government 
have proved they are really concerned about the public's 
livelihood and are striving hard to manage commodity prices in 
accordance with the latest development of the socialist market 
economy. Local leading comrades have realized that the price 
regulation and control is one of the government's important 
functions and producers and traders have realized that 
independent pricing does not mean that the state's supervision 
and control of prices are void. 
  2. The inspection of commodity prices has expedited 
implementation of all the price regulation and control measures 
formulated by the state. Some localities have already set 
up their grain marketing risk funds and nonstaple foodstuff 
price regulation funds. The marked price system has basically 
become a common practice among state-owned and collective-run 
retail shops and executive government organs which render 
services for fees and substantial progress has been made in 
introducing the marked price system among private enterprises 
and individual retail stalls. The state has formulated and 
promulgated the specific procedures for monitoring the prices of 
daily necessities and services and local authorities have 
expanded their price monitoring network to cover vegetables, 
medicines, salable residential flats, hairdressing services, 
bath house services, and so on, according to their local 
circumstances. Shanghai Municipality has taken the lead in 
formulating and promulgating the "Interim Regulations Against 
Price Cheating and Staggering Profits" and the "Detailed 
Procedures Governing Investigation and Handling of Cases of 
Staggering Profits Related to the Entertainment Business, 
Catering Industry, Clothing, and Mechanical and Electrical 
Products," which have played a positive role in curbing the 
practice of seeking staggering profits and in protecting the 
consumers' interests. These have been appreciated and endorsed 
by the public. Shenzhen City has lifted restrictions on the 
wholesale dealings in vegetables and pork and exercised control 
of the price margin in retail sales. This has not only ensured 
reasonable profit margins for the traders but also protected the 
producers' and consumers' interests. 
  3. A number of cases of violation of laws related to 
commodity prices have been investigated and handled. 
Incomplete statistics show that a total of over 190,000 cases 
of violation of laws related to commodity prices were 
investigated across the country from 10 March to 10 May. The 
amount of ill-gotten gains involved in these cases totaled 
nearly 400 million yuan. Over 100,000 of these cases have 
already been handled and the amount of fines resulting therefrom 
came to more than 88 million yuan. Of the cases involving 
malpractices, more than 41,000 are related to basic daily 
necessities, over 4,800 are related to the prices of monopolized 
capital goods, more than 2,700 involved prices of agricultural 
means of production, and more than 8,100 cases were related to 
charges for public utilities and services. Through the 
investigation and handling of cases of violation of price 
control laws, the trend of arbitrary price increases and 
unreasonable service charges is being checked. 
  4. The general inspection of commodity prices has 
caused the producers and traders to intensify self-regulation of 
prices. Through the investigation and handling of cases of 
violation of the state's price-control laws, enterprises have 
been guided to observe the principle of legal operation, fair 
transaction, and equal competition, and producers and traders 
have realized that legal pricing behavior is the principle that 
must be observed by enterprises when they are marching toward 
the market. At the same time, the enterprises have been helped 
to establish and improve the price control system and heighten 
their sense of self-restraint regarding pricing. Shandong 
Province has extensively introduced a sound self-restraint 
mechanism regarding pricing, the core of which is the 
appointment of price monitors and the establishment of five 
systems (specifically, the accounting system, the 
decision-making hierarchy system, the marked price system, the 
regular price inspection system, and the market survey system). 
  While fully appreciating the achievements made in the 
general inspection of commodity prices during the previous 
period, we must also be aware that we have not done an equally 
good job everywhere else. In just a few localities, people have 
not thoroughly realized the important significance of the 
general inspection of commodity prices, so they have acted a 
little slackly; on the other hand, since the legislation process 
has lagged behind, management has been inefficient, policies 
have not been clearly defined, and there has not been sufficient 
manpower to carry out the inspection. These few localities have 
been facing great difficulties and obstacles in the 
investigation and handling of cases of violation of laws related 
to price controls. All these issues deserve much attention and 
should be resolved at the next stage through effective measures. 
<H5>  Carry Out the General Inspection of Commodity Prices in </H5>
Depth and In Line With the Principle of Realizing Reform, 
Development, and Stability in a Balanced Way 
  Reform, opening up, and the economy have kept on developing 
along a good track since the beginning of this year. All the 
reformatory measures in the fields of finance and taxation, 
banking, foreign exchange and foreign trade, and the investment 
structure have been basically operating well since they were 
introduced and some of the measures have scored better results 
than expected. At a time when major reform projects have been 
presented, economic operations on the whole are gradually 
developing in a direction in favor of macroeconomic regulation 
and control. In the first quarter, the GDP increased by 12.7 
percent over the same period last year, while the gross 
industrial output value in January to April increased by 18.4 
percent. The financial situation has remained stable and 
revenue has continued to increase. The net amount of money 
withdrawn from circulation was 5.07 billion yuan in January to 
April, an increase of 41.92 billion [amount as published] over 
the amount of money withdrawn in the same period last year; 
meanwhile, the financial revenue increased by 22 percent over 
the same period last year. The foreign trade import-export 
volume and the state's spot exchange balance continued to 
increase. In January to April, the total import-export volume 
increased by 21.2 percent over the same period last year and, 
meanwhile, the state's spot exchange balance increased by $8.1 
billion over the figure at the beginning of the year. The 
margin of growth in fixed assets investments continued to narrow 
since efforts were made to intensify the management of extending 
loans for financing investments in fixed assets, to bring newly 
started projects under strict control, and to launch a general 
inspection of investments. In January to April, the value of 
investments made by state-owned units increased by 38.4 percent 
over the same period last year, with the growth margin 
decreasing by 30.5 percentage points as compared with the same 
period last year. The dramatically rising trend of the general 
commodity price level has been slowing down in the wake of the 
implementation of various macroeconomic regulation and control 
measures and the start of the general inspection of commodity 
prices. In April, the nationwide retail price index increased 
by 19.5 percent over the same period last year, with the 
inflation margin decreasing again by 0.7 percent as compared 
with that for March. It is expected that the price raises will 
continue to subside in May and June. However, we should also be 
aware that the current balance between the aggregate supply and 
demand is not very secure, some negative factors unfavorable to 
agricultural production still exist, the threat of inflation is 
still valid, the price raises are still quite high, and we are 
still far from our set target in our efforts to bring inflation 
rate under control. Therefore, we should never show any 
slackness in our work. 
  To ensure that the set targets are reached in the general 
inspection of commodity prices while maintaining a balance 
between reform, development, and stability, in the next stage we 
must continue to strive to really fulfill the five requirements 
set out by the State Council: 1. To further implement the 
price regulation and control measures put forward by the state, 
speed up the pace in formulating specific measures to introduce 
the marked price system and the price monitoring system, set up 
the grain marketing risk fund and the nonstaple foodstuff price 
regulation fund as soon as possible, and formulate price control 
laws and regulations. 2. To curb arbitrary price raises and 
unreasonable service charges for major categories of products 
and services, stop the practice of raising prices under the 
pretext of reform, and investigate and handle cases of violation 
of price-control laws. 3. To continue to publicize typical 
cases, positive and negative alike, thus giving fuller play to 
the initiative of the masses and the role of public opinion in 
monitoring prices. 4. To cause the producers and traders to 
exercise self-restraint and self-supervision and to heighten 
their sense of observance of laws and discipline as far as 
commodity prices are concerned. 5. To make great efforts to 
ease the price raises and to ensure that inflation continues to 
slow down. 
  In light of the current economic situation, we must lay 
stress on the following aspects in our efforts to fulfill the 
abovementioned five requirements: 
  First, it is necessary to further advance various price 
reform projects and implement all the regulation and control 
measures. 
  In the process of the general inspection of commodity 
prices, we must give a stronger push and guidance to all 
localities on implementation of all the major measures adopted 
by the State Council regarding price reform and macroeconomic 
regulation and control. The establishment of the grain 
marketing risk fund, the nonstaple foodstuff price regulation 
fund, and the important commodity reserve system are important 
measures taken by the state to lower commodity prices through 
economic means. All localities must establish these systems 
this year according to the requirements set by the State 
Council. It is necessary to actively study ways to establish 
the risk fund system regarding the supply of nonstaple 
foodstuffs, to gradually improve the economic means for the 
state to regulate and control commodity prices. The monitoring 
of prices for basic daily necessities and of service charges is 
a moderate administrative and guiding measure adopted to prevent 
decontrol and drastic fluctuation of commodity prices, under the 
precondition that the enterprise's decisionmaking powers 
regarding price setting are respected. All localities must 
formulate special implementation procedures in accordance with 
their local circumstances. Within the range of commodities and 
service items that are subject to price monitoring, those put 
under state control must undergo rigid price adjustment; as for 
those which are already free of state control, local authorities 
must, according to the principles laid down by the State 
Council, formulate specific implementation procedures governing 
the price adjustment operation reporting and application system, 
as well as the regulation of price differences and profit 
margins. It is necessary to make every effort to stabilize the 
prices of rice, food, and fuel. 
  Second, it is necessary to continue to investigate and 
curb the practice of arbitrarily raising prices under the 
pretext of reform. 
  To cope with new cases and new problems which have emerged 
during implementation of the reform plans regarding finance, 
taxation, foreign trade and foreign exchange, investments, and 
prices, the State Council and departments concerned have already 
formulated corresponding measures and methods which are now 
being carried out, step by step. Through the general inspection 
of commodity prices, we must oversee the producers and traders 
conscientiously implementing these measures and methods and we 
will lower prices which have been raised on their own without 
approval. We must take it as an important task to ensure the 
smooth implementation of all reform plans, work conscientiously, 
resolutely stop the practice of marking up prices at every link 
of the marketing chain, and strictly minimize any chain effects. 
Cases of lawbreaking behavior, such as raising prices in 
disregard of state regulations and seeking staggering profits, 
must be promptly investigated and dealt with severely. 
  Third, it is necessary to vigorously cultivate a market 
order which encourages open, fair, and just competition. 
  As a result of our efforts during the previous stage, the 
price disorders have been rectified to a certain extent. 
However, the phenomena of arbitrarily raising prices and 
collecting unreasonable service charges are still pretty 
serious. These are highlighted by the following cases: Some 
marketing units sell nationwide standard-price commodities at 
higher prices in disregard of state regulations; some 
enterprises producing chemical fertilizers and steel products, 
with their dominance over the market, sell their products at 
high prices; a small number of industrial and commercial 
enterprises have joined forces to monopolize the market; some 
enterprises take advantage of reformatory measures to raise 
prices; many medical services, education, postal and 
telecommunication services, and rural power supply sector 
grass-roots units arbitrarily charge their customers for 
services; and it is a common phenomenon that some private 
business owners and hawkers in the catering and garment 
marketing sectors seek staggering profits by cheating their 
customers. We should make unremitting efforts to stop these 
practices, resolutely fight activities contravening 
price-control laws, and develop a market environment which 
promotes open, fair, and just competition. We must make further 
efforts to set up the marked price system and expand it to cover 
all commodities and services; see that private enterprises, 
individual producers and traders, and stall owners and hawkers 
in all market places practice the marked price system; increase 
the degree of transparency of the pricing process; and we must 
place pricing under the public's supervision. 
  We must keep integrating the general inspection of commodity 
prices with investigations and study. We should further analyze 
the causes contributing to price disorder in light of the 
problems exposed in the general inspection of commodity prices, 
draw lessons from our past experience, check out loopholes, 
formulate in good time some measures to intensify price 
regulation and control, and establish and improve the 
regulations and systems concerned. With the aim of establishing 
the socialist market economic structure, we must speed up 
legislation regarding price controls; step up the formulation of 
the "price law"; formulate antitrust, antistaggering-profit, and 
anticheating laws and regulations; set standards to regulate 
pricing behaviors; and draw up the "price monitoring and 
inspection regulations." Those laws, ordinances, and 
regulations which have been promulgated should be improved to 
suit new circumstances. Some regulations and legal documents on 
regulatory functions which urgently need to be revised should be 
re-formulated. For instance, the "Interim Regulations Governing 
Simple Trial Procedures for General Cases of Violation of 
Price-Control Laws" and the "Regulations on Penalties on Cases 
of Violation of Price-Control Laws Regarding Failure To Lodge 
Application For and Report Price Adjustment." Those regulations 
and legal documents on regulatory functions regarding price 
control which no longer suit the actual circumstances should be 
sorted out and rescinded. Prior to the promulgation of 
nationwide applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations 
regarding price control, local authorities may formulate some 
local laws, ordinances, and regulations regarding price control, 
on their own and in light of their local conditions. We will 
work, step by step, to put the price regulation, control, 
management, supervision, and inspection on a standardized and 
legal basis, so that we can exercise price control according to 
the law.

Trade Commission: "State-Owned Enterprises Prosper"] 
  [Text] This year, sound development in production and 
reform has been registered by China's state-owned enterprises 
which are undergoing changes in their operational mechanisms and 
the reform for instituting a modern enterprise system. 
  From January to April this year, the total output value of 
state industrial enterprises increased by 4.7 percent over last 
year's same period. In April, the figure rose by 5 percent. No 
large-scale suspensions or partial halts in production were 
recorded for state enterprises during the period. A recent 
investigation carried out in 16 provinces and municipalities 
showed that the number of enterprises suspending production or 
operating below capacity accounted for only 10 percent of the 
total number of state-owned enterprises, with 4 percent actually 
having suspended production. An investigation in Beijing 
indicated that the proportion was even less, accounting for only 
2 percent of the total number of state firms in the 
municipality. In the country as a whole, enterprises required 
to suspend production or operate below capacity were mostly 
small and medium-sized enterprises in coal and textiles 
industries. 
  A number of factors have contributed to the adverse 
situation, including the excessive production capacity and 
unsalable products turned out by certain industries. In other 
cases, the operation of some enterprises has been handled 
improperly. Still others have been forced to close, suspend 
production, merge with other enterprises, or switch to the 
manufacture of other products in accordance with state 
industrial policies, or due to readjustment in each individual 
enterprise's organizational structure, or urban transformations 
projects. 
  Some reports about the increasing losses of state-owned 
enterprises are false and misleading. Since last July, to 
facilitate the establishment of a socialist market economic 
structure, state-owned enterprises have implemented the General 
Rules on the Finance of Enterprises and the Norms of Enterprise 
Accounting which dovetail the international accounting system. 
They have included some expenses formally paid by enterprise 
profits, such as interest on long-term loans and salary and 
bonus increases, into their production cost. Simultaneously, in 
order to accelerate technical transformation, such enterprises 
have been allowed to raise their rate of depreciation on 
equipment. All of the measures have helped enterprises expand 
their decision-making power and are beneficial to their 
long-term development. Although the actual book profits of 
enterprise have come down, with the result that the narrow 
profit margins of some enterprises have turned into losses and 
the latent losses of some other enterprises have been switched 
into explicit losses, the actual returns of enterprises have 
increased. 
  According to statistics released by the Ministry of Finance, 
between January and March this year, the cost outlays of 
enterprises increased 11 billion yuan due to disbursements 
recorded as costs, including items such as interest on loans for 
fixed assets, depreciation, bonuses, and welfare and educational 
fees. Counting 8.1 billion yuan of actual profits kept in 
account books, the amount of profits increased by 50 percent 
over last year's same period. 
  The government plans to adopt measures to solve the problem 
of losses incurred by some enterprises. For those with poor 
management, a modern enterprise system will be instituted, with 
due emphasis placed on turning losses into profits by deepening 
the reform and changing operational mechanisms. At present, 
relevant departments under the State Council and governments at 
all levels are adopting measures to carry out the work. 
  In an effort to alleviate the difficulties facing some 
state-owned enterprises and inspire them to change their 
operational mechanisms, the State Council has readjusted its 
credit policy toward industrial enterprises' circulating funds. 
The bank will provide loans to enterprises whose products enjoy 
a ready market even if they are currently suffering from losses 
or are in debt or are in arrears with payment of bank interest. 
However, it is prohibited from granting loans to enterprises 
with an excessive stock of unsalable products. With regard to 
the basic living expenses of employees in loss-making 
enterprises, the bank will provide loans, and local governments 
will also offer discounted interest on loans in order to ensure 
social stability. Enterprises which have no possibility for 
turning losses into profits will carry out procedures outlined 
in the Bankruptcy Law. Experiments will be carried out prior to 
nationwide implementation of the measures. 
  At present, some state enterprises are plagued by a shortage 
of circulating funds due to their excessive investment scale and 
extensive participation in construction projects. In addition, 
some enterprises seek increased output by engaging in blind 
production, and as a result the sales volume for their products 
has plummeted, loans cannot be repaid on schedule, and serious 
mutual delinquencies have occurred. To solve these problems, 
the government will strictly control excessive investments in 
fixed assets and bulging consumption funds. Meanwhile, the 
principle of "limiting the production of overstocked 
commodities, reducing inventories and facilitating marketing" 
will be implemented. The State Council has authorized relevant 
department to join forces with the bank and other departments to 
terminate mutual arrears between enterprises. The fund shortage 
is expected to be gradually eliminated through the concerted 
efforts of governments at all levels and enterprises themselves.

<F P=106> [By Zhang Hanya (1728 3352 0068) from the State Planning </F>
Commission Institute of Investment Research: "Analysis and 
Forecast of the 1994 Investment Trend in Fixed Assets"] 
  [Text] I. Estimation and Calculation of a Rational 
Scale for China's 1994 Investment in Fixed Assets 
  Investment in fixed assets is a major aspect of the use of 
national income. During a certain economic development period, 
in order to guarantee the sustained and steady development of 
the national economy, investment in fixed assets should be kept 
within a certain scale, namely within a rational scale. 
<H5>  1. The lower limit of the rational scale. </H5>
  There are mainly two factors deciding the minimum scale of 
fixed assets investment. First is the investment used to 
compensate for the depreciation of fixed assets to maintain the 
scale of simple reproduction. According to State Statistics 
Bureau data, and taking into consideration the effect of prices 
on the replenishment of fixed assets, we estimate the 1994 fixed 
assets investment needed to compensate for depreciation to be 
approximately 290 billion yuan. The second factor is the capital 
input to be put in place in 1994 so that projects which began 
construction during the past few years can be successfully 
completed and put into production. This is estimated at 
approximately 790 billion yuan. The sum of the two, 1.08 
trillion yuan, is the rational lower limit of 1994 fixed assets 
investment volume. 
<H5>  2. The upper limit of the rational scale. </H5>
  The principle for deciding the maximum rational scale is to 
not cause too much pressure on the national economy and people's 
living standards. The upper limit to the investment scale is 
resources which come from national production and income. 
Because of the large scale increase in China's fixed assets 
investment during the past two years, the productive fixed 
assets which can be inputted for use in 1994 has increased 14.3 
percent over 1993. Theoretically, one might infer that if all 
these fixed assets could be used efficiently, the 1994 GDP would 
increase by 14.3 percent. However, due to various reasons, the 
GDP increase will be slightly lower. According to our 
estimates, if efficiency is high, it is possible to reach 13 
percent, as in 1993. Since 1981, the average growth of China's 
GDP has been 9.5 percent and the average investment growth, 
according to comparable prices, has been 14.7 percent, or 
1.55-times the former. If one extrapolates according to this 
ratio, the investment growth in 1994 could reach 20 percent, 
that is, the investment increase in terms of physical quantity 
could reach 1.42 trillion yuan. According to forecasts, the 
1994 investment price index will be around 10 percent. That 
being the case, the currency investment volume, according to the 
current year's prices, will reach 1.56 trillion yuan. This, 
then, is the rational upper limit of the 1994 investment scale. 
<H5>  3. The appropriate scale for 1994. </H5>
  According to the above analysis, it can be seen that China's 
1994 fixed assets investment scale should be controlled between 
1.08 and 1.56 trillion yuan to guarantee the smooth development 
of the economy and avoid major problems. However, this does not 
mean that every point within the rational range is suitable for 
the economic development of China at the current stage. From an 
optimizing perspective, within this rational range there should 
be an optimal point. The closer we are to this point, the 
closer we are to an investment scale most suitable to China's 
economic development. This optimal point has to be decided 
according to the concrete situation in China's current 
development. 
  Seen from the growing trend of fixed assets investment 
during 
recent years, because of improvement and rectification, in 1989 
and 1990 the investment growth was actually negative and the 
1988 level was only regained in 1991. The rapid growth in 1992 
still showed certain features of a recovery. People did not 
feel any economic tension until close to the end of the year 
because of the substantial accumulation of both material and 
manpower resources during the previous few years of low-speed 
growth. The continued growth in 1993, on the other hand, 
belonged to real high-speed growth, especially since, after the 
high-speed growth of 1992, material resource accumulation had 
become low and almost everything relied on the current year's 
production and imports. This led to rapid price raises for 
capital goods and triggered price raises in some consumer goods, 
causing a rather tight situation in the whole national economy. 
  The year 1994 came after the rapid growth of 1992 and 1993. 
The 1993 investment growth, in particular, made China's 
investment rate (fixed assets investment of the whole 
society/GNP) reach as high as 37.8 percent in 1994. This is the 
highest investment rate since China's reform and opening to the 
outside world began (see Table 1) and is also very rare abroad. 
Only Japan, during its high-speed growth of the 1970's, 
exceeded this rate for one year (1973) (see Table 2).

  China is now in a transitional stage from a society having 
adequate food and clothing to one with a relatively comfortable 
lifestyle. In terms of economic power it is comparable to Japan 
in the early 1960's. According to China's situation, and taking 
foreign experience as a reference, the investment rate is most 
suitable between 33 and 35 percent. After the high-speed growth 
of fixed assets investment during 1992 and 1993, China's 
national economy was already over-stretched, and it was 
necessary to slightly relax it in 1994. At the same time, 
taking into consideration the fact that China's economy is still 
of the investment-propelled type, without a certain amount of 
investment growth, stagflation will occur and affect the 
continuous steady development of the entire economy. Therefore, 
the 1994 investment rate must not drop too much from 1993. 
After making some calculations, we believe that the most 
suitable investment rate for 1994 would be if we took the mean 
of 1992 and 1993, namely, to be controlled at around 35 percent. 
Based on national economic development plans, China's 1994 GNP 
at the current year's prices will reach 3.76 trillion yuan. 
According to a 35 percent investment rate, the scale of fixed 
assets investment should be controlled at around 1.316 trillion 
yuan, which is close to the middle point (1.32 trillion yuan) of 
the above defined rational range, with an increase of 10 percent 
over last year. 
<H5>  II. Forecast of Investment Scale Which May Actually Be </H5>
Reached in 1994 
  In 1994, the scale which China's fixed assets investment may 
actually reach will be mainly determined by three factors: One 
is the objective need, two is the resource supply capability, 
and three is the state macroeconomic regulation and control. 
  In terms of objective need, after Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
speeches on his southern trip were published, local governments 
made grand economic development plans during the later half of 
1992 or the first half of 1993. Among these, quite a few 
provinces and municipalities set the goal of catching up with or 
surpassing the "four small dragons." In order to realize these 
plans, increased construction projects and investment were 
unavoidable. The year 1994 is the second or third year for the 
provinces to implement their plans; it is a stage of ascendancy. 
Because the central government has delegated quite a bit of the 
investment power, the local investment based on self-raised 
funds has became difficult to control. In many places, all the 
funds raised last year and the year before have been used in 
construction, thereupon getting into a position of no turning 
back. Last year the state said that the investment scale was 
too large and the economy was overheated. However, not a single 
region considered its own investment scale to be too large or 
its own economy to be overheated. Therefore, it has been very 
difficult to ask the local governments to slow down investment. 
The central government, too, has a need to expand investment. 
First, given that all localities are launching large projects, 
it is necessary to expand investment in basic industries to 
guarantee the coordinated development of the future economy so 
that the supply capacity of "bottlenecks" can be expanded. 
Second, in order to guarantee the coordinated development of 
the whole society while the economy is developing, investment 
needs to be increased simultaneously in national defense, 
science and technology, culture, education, health, and sports, 
as well as environmental protection and other public welfare 
establishments. Third, in order to reduce regional gaps, 
investment needs to be increased in poverty-stricken areas. 
Fourth, investment needs to be made in the reform of the old 
industrial bases, the construction of commodity grain production 
bases, the treatment of large rivers, and so on according to 
national development plans. 
  In terms of the power to supply resources, it has been 
forecast that China's industrial growth for 1994 will still be 
above 15 percent. In recent years, China has entered a stage 
whereby growth in heavy industry has exceeded growth in light 
industry. The heavy industry, to a large extent, relies on 
investment and construction to realize its output value. 
Especially since the demand for investment growth in the past 
two years has caused a large scale investment increase in some 
industries producing materials for investment, such as 
metallurgy, construction materials, and so on, a growth in 
production capacity for these industries in 1994 can support a 
rather large increase in investment. Therefore, seen from the 
demand and ability to supply resources, we are still equipped 
with the conditions for high-speed growth in fixed assets 
investment in 1994. If not controlled, there will be no problem 
in achieving a 15 percent growth in physical quantity. And if 
we consider the 10 percent investment price coefficient, then 
the increase in the volume of currency will exceed 26.5 percent, 
reaching 1.5 trillion yuan or even higher. 
  Although this scale is within the rational range defined 
above, it exceeds the most suitable figure by nearly 200 billion 
yuan and will raise the investment rate to 39.9 percent. This 
will certainly put pressure on the national economy. 
  In order to reduce pressure on the national economy caused 
by 
the investment growth, the state, beginning in early 1994, has 
taken a series of soft-landing regulation and control measures. 
For instance, the state leaders have repeatedly talked about 
the danger of over-investment at National People's Congress 
meetings and on other occasions; the central authorities have 
issued circulars to control the scale of investment, demanding 
the tightening of the examination and approval of projects, the 
screening of development zones, the control of loan scale, the 
prohibition of chaotic fundraising, etc. Seen from the fact 
that, in the first quarter of this year the investment material 
market is basically balanced as to supply and demand and that 
prices are stable, and seen from other information relevant to 
investment growth, the abovementioned measures have achieved 
some results. If this trend develops, then it is possible to 
control the total amount of 1994 fixed assets investment at 
around 1.4 trillion yuan and lower the price index of investment 
material to under 7 percent. 
<H5>  III. Analysis of the 1994 Investment Structure and </H5>
Efficiency 
  Because the market mechanism's guidance over investment has 
gradually become stronger, and the governments at various levels 
have gained a better understanding of the importance of 
infrastructure, such as transportation and post and 
telecommunications, the percentage of investment in tertiary 
industries in 1992 and 1993 grew continuously, especially in 
transportation and post and telecommunications. This is both 
suitable to the adjustment of the industrial orientation in 
China and beneficial to alleviating "bottleneck" industries. 
One can say that the investment structure is changing in a 
rational direction. Seen from the current situation, this change 
will be maintained during 1994. Because the state will raise 
the prices of some energy products systematically during 1994, 
the percentage drop in investment in the energy industry during 
the past two years will be alleviated or stopped. However, some 
problems will still occur in the investment structure during 
1994. First, the investment decisionmakers in some regions lack 
a holistic concept. They choose where to invest with only local 
and current markets in mind, so that they over-invest in some 
industries the products of which are currently in great demand 
and which yield huge profits--for instance the real estate 
industry--while investing little or not at all in industries 
whose products currently do not seem be in great demand or which 
are more difficult to build, such as high-tech products or 
industries in which China is still comparatively backward and 
which produce upgraded mechanical equipment and special raw 
materials. Second, some places have begun too many new 
infrastructure projects which, due to insufficient financial 
ability, may lead to delays in completion or cause them to lie 
idle after construction. For example, almost all coastal cities 
are now launching port projects. The occurrence of these 
situations is hard to avoid. 
  The establishment of a socialist market economic system and 
the intensive competition of many products in the market in 
recent years have already caused the majority of investment 
decisionmakers to begin to pay attention to the efficiency of 
investment. Seen from the actual situation of the past two 
years, efficiency still remains an important problem to be 
resolved energetically in China's investment field. Currently, 
there are still many investment decisionmakers who lack 
scientific decisionmaking concepts. In order to launch projects 
quickly, they neglect feasibility analyses, which are vital to 
guaranteeing the efficiency of construction projects, or only 
perfunctorily put up a show for others to see. Such careless 
decisionmaking cannot guarantee the efficiency of investment. 
  Scale, structure, and efficiency are the three major 
problems 
in the field of investment. Of the three, efficiency plays a 
decisive role. If an investment has good efficiency, the larger 
its scale, the larger its contribution to future economic 
development. This should be encouraged. To pay attention to 
efficiency, it is necessary to conduct good feasibility analyses 
when deciding on a project and to forecast future markets, the 
supply of productive resources, and the efficiency of 
production. If one makes decisions only after one is convinced 
that satisfactory results can be obtained, then one will not 
blindly launch projects and expand the investment scale but will 
reduce industrial imbalances and propel the investment structure 
towards a rational industrial structure. Therefore, to pay 
attention to investment efficiency is the key to solving all 
three problems in the field of investment at the same time. 
  To sum up, we believe that in 1994, apart from adopting 
methods such as tightening control on the tap of capital to 
avoid excessive inflation of the investment scale, we should 
raise the level of project decisionmaking and add investment 
efficiency as one of the major goals of macroeconomic regulation 
and control. By implementing the investment restructuring plan 
raised in the "Decision by the CPC Central Committee Concerning 
Several Issues in the Socialist Market Economic System," we 
should "gradually establish risk responsibility for corporate 
investment and bank credit and loans." We should form, as fast 
as possible, a system unifying responsibility, authority, and 
benefits, which will restrict the actions of investors. We 
should further perfect supporting institutions, such as the 
publication of information, consultancy, examination and 
approval of feasibility reports, etc., and thus create 
conditions for scientific decisionmaking on projects.

  [Text] Beijing, June 16 (AFP) -- China rejected Thursday a 
U.S. draft resolution calling for UN sanctions against North 
Korea over the nuclear issue, saying it was still not too late 
to return to the negotiating table. "China in principle doesn't 
subscribe to the involvement of the Security Council in the 
nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula or resorting to sanctions 
to solving it," foreign ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told 
journalists when asked for China's view of the draft. "China 
believes that the only way to a proper solution is direct 
dialogue held between the parties concerned," Shen told a weekly 
news briefing, urging all sides to make every effort to ensure a 
return to talks rather than resorting to action that could lead 
to confrontation. "We believe there is still room and the 
possiblity for a proper solution to this issue," Shen said. 
  The United States presented UN Security Council members 
Wednesday with the draft of a resolution calling for phased 
sanctions against North Korea after it this week pulled out of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). China, which has 
veto power as a permanent member of the Security Council, has 
consistently opposed calls for the imposition of sanctions 
against its communist ally.

  [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government 
demands once again that the Vietnamese Government stop its acts 
of infringement upon China's sovereignty, a Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said here today. 
  Since mid-May this year, the Vietnamese side has sent 
exploratory vessels to Wan An Reef (Vanguard Bank) area of 
China's Nansha [Spratly] sea area to conduct geophysical 
operation, spokesman Shen Guofang said at a weekly press 
conference this afternoon. 
  As is known to all, China has indisputable sovereignty over 
the Nansha Islands and their adjacent waters, and Wan An Reef is 
part of the Nansha islands, he said. 
  In recent years, Vietnam has demarcated certain blocks in 
this area for external bidding and repeatedly harassed the 
normal scientific survey and fishing activities of Chinese 
vessels, he said. Now it has moved into this area for oil and 
gas prospecting and development. 
  "It must be pointed out that these moves have seriously 
violated China's sovereignty over the Nansha Islands, and also 
put the `Wab-21' petroleum contract signed between China 
National Offshore Oil Corporation and Crestone Energy 
Corporation of the U.S.A. in serious jeopardy", Shen said. 
  The Chinese side has made solemn representations on many 
occasions to the Vietnamese side over its acts of violating 
China's sovereignty in Nansha, he said. 
  "The Chinese Government demands once again that the 
Vietnamese Government, proceeding from the overall interests of 
maintaining and developing the bilateral relations and 
preserving peace and stability in the region, stop the 
above-mentioned acts of infringement upon China's sovereignty," 
the spokesman said.

  [Text] Beijing, June 16 (AFP) -- China confirmed Thursday 
that British Foreign Office Minister Alistair Goodlad will visit 
here in July, stressing Beijing's desire to resume cooperation 
with London despite "difficulties" over Hong Kong. Goodlad will 
visit China as the guest of the foreign ministry, but 
arrangements for the trip are still being discussed, ministry 
spokesman Shen Guofang told journalists. 
  Goodlad -- who has special responsibility for Hong Kong, 
Southeast Asia, Australasia and the Pacific -- will be the first 
foreign office minister to visit here since Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd's trip last July. 
  "The Chinese side hopes that difficulties on the question of 
Hong Kong will not affect ties between the two countries in 
other areas," said Shen, but added this would depend on the 
"approach and actions" of the British. He pointed to "some 
progress" already in expert meetings on the funding of Hong 
Kong's new 20.3 billion dollar airport project and on the 
allocation of military sites after 1997. Noting that 
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group talks would resume next 
Tuesday, Shen said "we hope an agreement can be reached at an 
early date." 
  The conciliatory comments are a far cry from the 
recrimations 
traded by the two sides in the past two years during a row over 
democratic reform in Hong Kong and the latest sign that China 
and Britain are seeking to mend fences. Foreign Minister Qian 
Qichen said Tuesday Beijing and London should continue 
cooperation on other aspects of the colony's 1997 handback to 
China. Earlier this week, plans were announced for a 100-member 
British trade delegation to visit China in September for a 
15-day trip aimed at boosting economic cooperation.

  [Text] Seoul, June 15 (XINHUA) -- Former U.S. President 
Jimmy Carter today passed through the heavily-fortified border 
village of Panmunjom on his way to Pyongyang for talks with 
President Kim Il- song over the nuclear issue. 
  Carter arrived here on Monday [13 June] in a prelude to his 
visit to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) for 
possible mediation in Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons 
program. 
  During his stay here, the former U.S. president respectively 
met with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, deputy prime 
minister and National Unification Board (NUB) Minister Yi 
Hong-ku and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu. 
  Carter is likely to convey to the DPRK the position of the 
U.S. and South Korea on a settlement of the nuclear problem. 
  His visit to the Korean peninsula comes at a time when the 
DPRK decided to quit the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency while 
South Korea, the U.S. and Japan are stepping up their effort 
towards U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang. 
  The DPRK has reportedly banned inspectors of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) from testing samples 
of nuclear fuel to determine whether it has been diverted 
secretly to make atomic weapons. 
  The DPRK insists that its nuclear program is strictly 
peaceful and warned that any sanctions aimed at forcing it to 
accept inspections will be regarded as a declaration of war. 
  Carter said earlier that his trip to the Korean peninsula 
would be a private one. "My hope is to discuss some of the 
important issues of the day with leaders of the area," he said. 
  The former president will return to Seoul via Panmunjom on 
June 18 to brief South Korean President Kim Yong-sam on the 
results of his talks with DPRK leaders before heading back to 
Washington.

which is of common concern. 
  Carter passed through the truce village of Panmunjon and

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (XINHUA) -- It's time for the 
United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
(DPRK) to establish a comprehensive relationship, said former 
U.S. President Jimmy Carter here on Wednesday [16 June]. 
  Speaking at a dinner in his honor, he said both nations 
should prepare for overall bilateral relations, which should 
include friendship, mutual understanding, trade and personnel 
exchange. 
  On the vital nuclear issue on the peninsula, he noted that 
unfortunately this problem has caused great misunderstanding 
between the two nations, and expressed the hope that the dispute 
can be solved through joint efforts. 
  As soon as a solution to this issue is found, other problems 
can also be solved, he said. 
  Carter added that he and the U.S. leaders are confident that 
a peaceful unification of the Korean peninsula can be achieved. 
  Kim Yong-nam, vice premier and foreign minister of the DPRK, 
said that it is the common desire of both nations and their 
people that bilateral relations will be normalized one day. 
  Kim pointed out that if the U.S. respects the DPRK's 
sovereignty and treats it justly, a perfect solution to the 
nuclear issue will certainly be found. 
  This solution will be conducive to peace in Asia and 
throughout the world as well, he added. 
  Carter passed through the truce village of Panmunjon and 
arrived here Wednesday morning on a four-day private visit to 
the DPRK for possible mediation of the dispute over Pyongyang's 
suspected nuclear weapons program. He is expected to meet with 
the DPRK's leader Kim Il-song.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said today that it has 
completed all the necessary legal procedures to withdraw from 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as of June 13. 
  KOREA'S CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (KCNA) reported that Foreign 
Minister Kim Yong-nam had sent a notice to Warren Christopher, 
secretary of state of the United States, which is the depository 
state of the IAEA statute, on the same day as Pyongyang 
announced its withdrawal from the world's nuclear watchdog body. 
  This move, which is in accordance with the related principle 
of the IAEA statute, means that the DPRK Government has 
completed all the legal procedures necessary for the withdrawal, 
according to KCNA. 
  The statement came on the second day after the IAEA said 
that 
the DPRK has failed to formally inform the agency of its 
decision as well as not presenting a written notice to the 
United States. 
  The actual state of the withdrawal will be decided by the 
agency's secretariat after it gives an official reply to the 
DPRK's written notice to the United States, which should be 
submitted in advance, said the IAEA. 
  Pyongyang Monday announced its withdrawal and said it will 
permit no more IAEA inspections for the continuity of nuclear 
safeguards in the country after the IAEA decided on June 10 to 
impose sanctions against it. 
  In the notice to Christopher, Kim described the IAEA 
decision 
as "another unjust resolution" despite DPRK's "strong opposition 
and warnings" and said: "The secretariat has pursued the 
dishonest political purposes of stifling the DPRK under the 
pretext of its inspections rather than seeking a fair resolution 
of the nuclear issue."

<F P=106> ["South Korea Approves Sanctions Resolution Against DPRK"] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, June 16 (XINHUA) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
has approved the United States-drafted resolution to be 
submitted to the United Nations on sanctions against the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), South Korean 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said here today. 
  The government reviewed the draft resolution it received 
early on Wednesday [15 June] at a unification and national 
security policy coordination meeting, and agreed that it was 
ready to take part in UN consultations, han said at a press 
conference. 
  The draft gives the DPRK a 30-day grace period to comply 
unconditionally with the nuclear safeguards agreement and 
implement the inter-Korean accord on denuclearization. 
  It contains six points, including a mandatory ban on weapons 
imports and exports, partial diplomatic sanctions, a ban on all 
flights except regular passenger services, and an embargo on any 
technical cooperation related to nuclear technology. 
  These are the first phase of sanctions, Han said, with the 
second phase to include preventing the remittance of funds to 
the DPRK from abroad and freezing all the DPRK's assets abroad. 
  The second phase would be implemented immediately in the 
event of any negative action by pyongyang, such as withdrawing 
from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), he explained. 
  The U.S. drew up the draft resolution after consultations 
with South Korea and Japan when the DPRK banned inspectors from 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) from testing 
samples of nuclear fuel to determine whether some had been 
diverted secretly to make atomic weapons. 
  Pyongyang has warned that any sanctions aimed at forcing it 
to accept inspections will be regarded as a declaration of war. 
At the same time it has insisted that its nuclear program is 
strictly peaceful. 
  On Monday, the DPRK announced that it would withdraw 
immediately from the IAEA, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, 
and accept no more inspections of its nuclear program. It said 
this was in retaliation for the agency's own sanctions 
resolution against Pyongyang providing for an immediate halt to 
IAEA technical assistance to the DPRK totaling 250,000 U.S. 
dollars a year. 
  "The draft resolution, if adopted as it is, will be very 
effective in exerting pressure on the DPRK," said the South 
Korean foreign minister. 
  Han predicted that it would take two or three weeks for the 
draft to pass discussion by the United Nations Security Council 
and to be finally adopted. 
  "As we have said before, the purpose of the resolution is 
not 
to impose the sanctions themselves, but to clear up the 
suspicion about the DPRK's past nuclear activities and secure 
nuclear transparency," he explained. 
  Before, or even after, the resolution is adopted, the door 
will remain open for dialogue "if the DPRK fulfills its 
obligations under the nuclear safeguards accord and cooperates 
with the IAEA," Han said.

<F P=106> ["Sanctions Against DPRK Undesirable, Kozyrev Says"] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, June 15 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev said on Wednesday [15 June] that 
international sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea (DPRK) over the nuclear issue would be "very 
undesirable." 
  After his talks with his visiting Vietnamese Counterpart 
Nguyen Manh Cam, Kozyrev recalled in an interview with reporters 
that Russia has proposed holding an international conference on 
security and nuclear-free status of the Korean peninsula. 
  This idea is now under consideration, he added. 
  "There has been a proposal to impose sanctions. We do not 
rule out the possibility, quite unfortunately, that it may come 
to that. But it would be a very unreasonable development of the 
situation. It would be also unreasonable if North Korea (DPRK) 
withdraws from the nuclear non-proliferation regime," the 
Russian foreign minister added. 
  "I think that not all chances have been lost and there is 
still hope that this door has not been closed yet," he said.

  [Text] Washington, June 15 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton announced here that the United States was beginning 
formal discussions today at the United Nations about a sanction 
resolution against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
(DPRK). 
  "We are going to be very deliberate, very firm," Clinton 
told 
reporters at the White House before meeting with bipartisan 
congressional leaders. 
  He said that the proposed resolution would "include phased 
sanctions designed to deal not only with the actions of the 
North Koreans to date, but as a deterrent to future constructive 
conduct with regard to the IAEA (International Atomic Energy 
Agency) and the NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty) [Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty]." 
  "I feel that we are pursuing the proper course at this 
time," 
the President claimed. 
  Asked what he hopes for former President Jimmy Carter's 
meetings with the DPRK leaders, Clinton said he is more hopeful 
that Carter "will get a better sense from them about where they 
are and that they will understand that we're very firm in our 
position." 
  But "there is an alternative path and a very good one for 
North Korea," Clinton also said, "They don't have to become more 
isolated; they could become more engaged in the world in ways 
that would be much better for their own people."

  [Text] United Nations, June 15 (XINHUA) -- The top U.S. 
Official to the United Nations revealed today the contents of a 
draft resolution on sanctions against the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea (DPRK) amid the current nuclear dispute. 
  Madeline Albright, the U.S. permanent representative to the 
United Nations, read to reporters the elements of the 
U.S.-drafted resolution. 
  "Phase one will impose significant sanctions and will impose 
heavy price in terms of diplomatic isolation on North Korea," 
she said. 
  "And these sanctions will take into effect after a 
relatively 
short period of time which is normal in our sanctions 
resolutions," she added. 
  Generally speaking, the sanctions fall into five categories, 
she said. The five categories are as follows: 
  First is stopping technical and scientific cooperation, that 
can be contributed to DPRK nuclear knowledge. 
  The second is terminating all economic assistance through 
the 
United Nations or its subsidiaries. 
  The third is reducing the size and scope of diplomatic 
activities with the DPRK both bilaterally and through 
international organizations. 
  The fourth will be curtailing cultural, technical, 
scientific, commercial and educational exchanges with the DPRK 
both in that country and elsewhere. 
  And finally, prohibiting the DPRK from exporting and 
importing any weapons or components, and that is mandatory. 
  "If there is further backsliding by North Korea in terms of 
safeguarding present and future nuclear material, we will 
tighten the sanctions by cutting all financial transaction with 
Pyongyang," she warned. 
  But she said this would not be a sanction by tomorrow or the 
day after tomorrow. She said that it was a complex problem, 
that the U.S. would be working with all members of the Security 
Council, as well as the Republic of Korea and Japan, in this 
particular issue. 
  The DPRK officially notified the U.S. On Tuesday that it was 
withdrawing from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

<F P=106> ["Political Talk" column by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 3768): </F>
"Carter Arrives in Pyongyang, Korean Situation Shows Sign of 
Improvement"] 
  [Text]De Facto "Presidential Envoy" 
  Just as the DPRK announced its withdrawal from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and the Security 
Council was deliberating on economic sanctions, Jimmy Carter, 
former U.S. Democratic president, arrived in Pyongyang yesterday 
through Panmunjom. He will stay in Pyongyang for three days and 
will meet and hold talks with President Kim Il-song. Although 
foreign media described the situation on the Korean Peninsula as 
"very tense" following the DPRK withdrawal from IAEA, in fact 
there is still much room for relaxation in the situation. 
Carter's visit to the DPRK is probably a turning point. 
  Although former President Carter has gone to the DPRK in an 
unofficial capacity, he is actually a "special envoy" of 
President Clinton and the importance of this visit is 
self-evident. The DPRK also attaches great importance to 
Carter's visit has given him a red carpet reception. All this 
shows that the current U.S.-DPRK talks on the nuclear issue are 
an important struggle. 
  When withdrawing from the IAEA, Pyongyang issued a toughly 
worded statement warning the Security Council that the adoption 
of economic sanctions would be tantamount to a "declaration of 
war" against Pyongyang and would meet strong resistance. 
  The U.S. reaction is that, if the DPRK officially withdraws 
from the international nuclear body, it shows that the situation 
is serious and that it is necessary to step up sanctions. 
Japan, Canada, and other countries have also indicated their 
support for sanctions. We should now see how the Security 
Council will deal with this issue. The Security Council is 
expected to meet on 15 June. Generally speaking, a draft 
resolution should first be discussed among the five permanent 
members (the United States, Britain, France, Russia, and China) 
and the United States should explain to the 10 nonpermanent 
members the contents of the draft sanctions resolution. 
However, before the result of the Carter-Kim Il-song talks is 
known, all posturing by the United States and the DPRK can only 
be regarded as "preparing the ground." 
<H5>  Recriminations By the United States and DPRK Are Only Aimed </H5>
At "Preparing the Ground" 
  The DPRK has indicated its readiness to go to war and 
sounded 
very serious. However, the situation will change if senior U.S. 
and DPRK officials resume talks. When meeting with Harrison, 
senior researcher at the U.S. Institute for International Peace, 
Kim Il-song said: If the United States provides DPRK with a 
light water reactor [qing shui lu 6536 3055 3619] or decides to 
grant the relevant credits, the latter is ready to suspend the 
construction of a 50 mw graphite moderated atomic reactor. 
  Kang Sok-chu, DPRK's first deputy foreign minister and chief 
representative at the senior U.S.-DPRK official talks, told 
Harrison that the light water reactor would be imported from 
Russia rather than the United States and that the money could be 
paid from U.S. loans to Russia. Provided that the supply of a 
light water reactor is resolved, DPRK is ready to freeze its 
current nuclear program. 
  Harrison considered this plan as feasible. He said the 
United States will welcome the DPRK proposal on freezing the 
construction of an atomic reactor and its processing facilities. 
He hoped that the two countries will open talks in this respect. 
<H5>  The DPRK Is Incapable of Producing Nuclear Bombs </H5>
  In fact, the DPRK wants to normalize relations with the 
United States and has proposed the resumption of talks by senior 
government officials. Secondly, it hopes the United States will 
provide it with the money to buy a light water reactor for which 
it is ready to freeze its current nuclear program. 
  Seen against this background, how can we say that the DPRK 
wants to make atom bombs to threaten other countries? It wants 
to raise funds from the United States and Japan even when buying 
a light water reactor. Does not this precisely show that the 
DPRK has no plan and is incapable of developing nuclear armament? 
  It is believed that Carter will be able to obtain a new and 
direct message in Pyongyang and understand the DPRK's 
intentions. First of all, the United States should not press 
forward steadily and threaten to impose sanctions against the 
other side at every turn. Although the DPRK claims to withdraw 
from the IAEA, it has not withdrawn from the International 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. If the United States applies 
steady pressure, it will force the DPRK to withdraw from the 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty as well. Conversely, if the 
talks run smoothly, Pyongyang may cancel its withdrawal from 
IAEA. 
  It is impossible to compel a country to submit by applying 
strong pressure. The actual situation in the Korean issue is 
not as serious as reported outside; the crucial issues are U.S. 
policy and Clinton's attitude.

  [Text] Moscow, June 15 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin announced today that the Kremlin is ready to reduce the 
Russian Army from three million to 1.5 million people, according 
to reports reaching here. 
  During a meeting with Amur regional officials in the far 
eastern city of Blagoveshchensk, the Russian leader stressed 
that the Army does not need such a large amount of technology 
and that mobile armaments, which would compete on the external 
market, are essential. 
  Yeltsin also said that, in addition to Malaysia, Russian 
arms 
will be also purchased by Thailand and Australia. 
  Observers here believe that it is difficult for Russia to 
keep the original number of troops because of a lack of money.

  [Text] Khartoum , June 15 ( XINHUA ) -- Sudanese President 
Umar Hasan al-Bashir today described a U.S. approach toward 
Sudan as positive reflecting its growing interest in Sudan. 
  The president opined that the fact that the U.S. President 
Bill Clinton's envoy to Sudan Melissa F. Wells did not raise 
issues such as terrorism and human rights during talks with 
Sudanese officials here was a step towards better relations 
between the two governments. 
  Bashir, in an address to a regular get-together with 
Sudanese 
media leaders here, described the U.S. envoys visit as the first 
direct dealing between the Sudanese and U.S. Governments. 
  He welcomed the approach, saying that the U.S. envoy came to 
discuss concrete issues of peace (in south Sudan) and relief 
measures. 
  The U.S. presidential envoy, who arrived here on June 11, 
concluded a four-day visit to the country.

<F P=106> ["Round-Up" by Wang Nan: "In Banking Business, It's American </F>
vs. Foreign"] 
  [Text] Washington, June 15 (XINHUA) -- With declining 
credit quality, lower profits and efficiency, foreign banks are 
being squeezed out of America's lucrative financial markets. 
  And it was not long ago when fears were raised in financial 
circles that foreign banks would be out-competing U.S. banks in 
their home market. 
  Recent developments, observers here pointed out, called into 
question the argument that the role of U.S.-owned banks is 
declining. 
  It also suggested that despite having captured a bigger 
share 
of U.S. banking businesses, further penetration into the U.S. 
market by foreign banks is far from certain. 
  "It's clear foreign banks have gained significant U.S. 
market 
share in business lending, but that growth seems to have reached 
a plateau," said Daniel Nolle, economist in the Department of 
Treasury. 
  According to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
(OCC), in 1991, foreign banks accounted almost 24 percent of 
banking industry assets in the U.S. and 45 percent of business 
lending to U.S. firms. 
  But since then, primarily due to reduced assets of Japanese 
banks in the U.S., foreign banks' market share has declined, 
dipping to 28 percent at mid-year 1993. 
  Meanwhile, for every year since 1983, except 1987, foreign 
banks in the U.S. consistently recorded lower return on assets 
and return on equity as compared with U.S.-owned banks. 
  After 1991, while U.S. banks saw a surge in profits, with 
return on assets at 0.95 percent in 1992, foreign banks' profits 
were lower than their 1980s average, with 1992's return on 
assets at 0.03 percent. 
  The return on equity in 1992 was 0.41 for foreign-owned 
banks 
and 13.21 for all U.S. banks. 
  "Foreign banks have paid a price in terms of efficiency and 
profitability for the U.S. market share they have captured," 
said the latest report by the OCC's Bank Research Division. 
  "From a broad perspective," the report asserted, "This 
result 
should not be surprising." 
  A year ago, when the latest data were available, there were 
700 foreign banks' branches, agencies and subsidiaries in the 
U.S., with total assets of 948 billion U.S. dollars. 
  Observers said that foreign banks entered the U.S. market 
mainly to service the international trade and direct investment 
needs of their home country clients. 
  Meanwhile, the observers said, cross-country differences in 
bank capital requirements also are likely to have an impact on 
the growth of foreign banks in the U.S.. 
  More recently, foreign banks from a number of countries have 
reduced their presence in the U.S. due to banking sector 
problems in their home countries. 
  In particular, Japanese-owned banks operating in the U.S. 
have been affected by credit quality and capital requirements 
problems of their parent banks. 
  Despite the integration of the global financial community, 
observers said, banks expanding abroad still have significant 
hurdles to overcome in order to operate successfully in a 
foreign market.

  [Text] On the evening of 15 June, Vice Governor Wang 
Zhongzhang met with Rogachev, Russian ambassador to China, the 
Russian Chamber of Industry and Commerce delegation, and the 
Russian enterprise society delegation at the provincial 
government office. 
  On behalf of Acting Governor Tian Fengshan, Vice Governor 
Wang Zhongzhang extended welcome to and thanked the Russian 
guests for attending the trade fair. He said: The Harbin trade 
fair has become a major affair for border economic and trade 
cooperation between China and Russia. The successful 
convocation of each Harbin trade fair can never be separated 
from the efforts of the Russian side. Not long ago, when 
Rogachev visited Beijing, he and the Chinese side expressed the 
determination to keep an eye on developing cooperative relations 
between the two countries during the 21st century and said that 
the Harbin trade fair was an ideal place for this. 
  Rogachev said: It is not easy to hold this kind of trade 
fair. He also believed that Harbin trade fair had become a 
bridge for world economic and trade cooperation. He also 
offered views on the current issue of carrying out economic and 
trade cooperation with our province.

  [Text] Moscow, June 15 (XINHUA) -- President Boris Yeltsin 
has warned that a system of making inefficient organizations 
bankrupt will be introduced in Russia in the near future. 
  Yeltsin's comments came as he met with entrepreneurs in the 
city of Blagoveshchensk in the Far East Amur region of the 
country, on the border with China. 
  "The times when enterprises and whole regions lived at the 
expense of the state budget are over," Yeltsin said. "It is 
necessary to find one's own resources to survive since living on 
subsidies under market conditions is a shame." 
  He explained that Russia's current task was to transfer the 
macro reform to a micro level which is aimed at attracting 
investment to boost production and solve social problems. 
  Earlier today Yeltsin visited the Blagoveshchensk 
shipbuilding yard where he talked with the workers and 
management. He promised to help seek customers for larger 
fishing seiners while suggesting the yard should also make small 
boats, which farmers need, on direct, non-state orders. 
  Yeltsin arrived in Blagoveshchensk on Tuesday [14 June] for 
a 
four-day working visit. He is also scheduled to visit the local 
Republic of Tuva.

  [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- A senior official of 
the Communist Party of China (CPC), Hu Jintao, said here today 
that China intends to increase and expand the friendly contacts 
between the CPC and the People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan 
on the basis of four principles covering inter-party relations. 
  "China also wishes to enhance its long-term friendly ties 
and 
cooperation with Uzbekistan on the basis of the five principles 
of peaceful co-existence," said Hu, a Standing Committee member 
of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, at a 
meeting with a delegation from the People's Democratic Party of 
Uzbekistan. 
  The delegation, led by A.M. Jalolov [spelling of name as 
received], second secretary of Uzbekistan's party central 
committee, arrived here on June 15 as the CPC's guests. 
  Hu, also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central 
Committee, noted that traditional friendship between the two 
countries has grown since they established diplomatic ties. 
  He noted that Uzbekistan President Islam Azim Karimov's 
visit 
to China in 1992 and Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit to 
Uzbekistan in April this year gave a powerful impetus to the 
growth of bilateral relations in depth and opened a new chapter 
for such relations. 
  Jalolov said the bilateral relations between the two 
countries and the two parties are developing satisfactorily. 
  The Uzbekistan people and party are greatly interested in 
the 
tremendous achievements that China has made in reform and 
construction, he said. 
  Jalolov expressed the hope that his current visit will 
enable 
him to learn more about China's experience. 
  Besides Beijing, the delegation is expected to visit 
Shanghai 
and east China's Jiangsu Province.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by XINHUA reporters Wang Dajun (3769 1129 6511) </F>
and Jiang Zhi 3068 3112: "The Origin of the Korean Nuclear 
Issue"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 15 Jun (XINHUA) -- Recently, disputes 
surrounding the Korean nuclear issue have again intensified. 
  On 10 June, the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
decided to suspend its assistance to the DPRK [chao xian 2600 
7639], and the United States and others advocated economic and 
military sanctions. The DPRK reacted strongly to this. On 13 
June, it announced it would immediately withdraw from the IAEA. 
  The Korean nuclear issue is long-standing. After the Gulf 
war, the United States, using its satellite photos as proof, 
said that it suspected there were facilities in the DPRK's 
Yongbyon district, about 100 km north of Pyongyang, used for the 
development of nuclear weapons, claiming inspections of the 
DPRK's nuclear facilities must be carried out. The DPRK 
repeatedly declared that it had no intention to produce nuclear 
weapons nor did it have the capability to do so. At the same 
time, it accused the United States of deploying nuclear weapons 
to the ROK [han guo 7281 0948] to threaten its security. The 
two sides have since become antagonistic toward each other. 
Only later, after the DPRK and the ROK signed the "Joint 
Declaration on Denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula" and the 
DPRK signed a nuclear safety agreement with the IAEA and agreed 
to accept inspections, did the tense atmosphere on the peninsula 
somewhat ease. 
  During the period between May 1992 and February last year, 
the DPRK received unscheduled nuclear inspections from the IAEA 
on six occasions. However, the two sides disagreed on the 
targets and inspection results. In February last year, the IAEA 
Board of Governors passed a resolution to carry out mandatory 
"special inspections" on the DPRK's nuclear facilities. At the 
same time, the United States and the ROK resumed their joint 
military exercise, "Team Spirit," which had been suspended in 
1992. In light of this, the DPRK announced on 12 March 1993 its 
withdrawal from the "Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT]," 
which it had joined at the end of 1985. The situation on the 
peninsula thus became tense again. 
  Under these circumstances, the United States held two rounds 
of vice foreign ministerial talks with the DPRK and made 
promises on the question of assisting the DPRK in remodeling its 
nuclear facilities. The DPRK subsequently announced that it 
would not withdraw from the "NPT" for the time being. During 
their talks, both sides agreed to hold a third round of talks 
within two months to discuss settlement of the nuclear issue and 
improvement of bilateral relations. However, because of 
differences over a number of issues between the two sides, the 
third round of talks were not held. It was not until the last 
10 days of February this year did the DPRK reach a compromise 
with the IAEA and the United States: The DPRK agrees to receive 
inspections of its seven nuclear facilities; the South and North 
resume contact on the exchange of special envoys; the United 
States and the ROK agree to stop this year's joint military 
exercise; and the United States agrees to hold the third 
high-level talks with the DPRK. At the same time, the United 
States also put forward two conditions, namely the IAEA's 
inspection of the DPRK's nuclear facilities be acceptable to all 
parties and the South and North realize the exchange of special 
envoys. After these two conditions were essentially met, the 
situation on the peninsula became further eased. As a result, 
there was another inspection of the DPRK's nuclear facilities by 
the IAEA in early March this year. 
  However, the IAEA was not satisfied with the inspection 
results, which led to the sharpening of differences among the 
concerned parties. During the last 10 days of April, the DPRK 
told the IAEA that it wanted to replace the fuel rods in its 
five megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon and invited it to send 
personnel to the site to supervise the replacement. However, 
while expressing a cautious welcome, the IAEA again set 
preconditions, asking the DPRK to accept its all-out inspection 
of its nuclear facilities and operation process. The DPRK did 
not accept this demand. In early May, after the IAEA indicated 
that it would not send personnel to the DPRK to supervise the 
replacement, the DPRK went ahead and replaced the nuclear fuel 
rods by itself. The IAEA held that the DPRK's action made it 
impossible to determine whether the plutonium produced by the 
nuclear reactor had been diverted for other uses. The DPRK, on 
the other hand, stressed that its replacement of the nuclear 
fuel rods was monitored by the IAEA's monitoring device 
installed at its nuclear reactor and waste facilities, and that 
its replacement method fully preserved the technical possibility 
for later measurements. 
  The serious difference over this issue between the IAEA and 
the DPRK has drastically chilled the eased atmosphere on the 
peninsula. In wake of the IAEA's recent announcement that it 
would suspend its assistance, a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman 
issued a statement saying the DPRK deems all IAEA resolutions 
null and void; that it will not accept continuous nuclear safety 
inspection, which it accepted when it was placed under special 
status; and that it again declared that it regards UN sanctions 
as a declaration of war against the DPRK. 
  The origin and development of the Korean nuclear issue shows 
that the issue can only be resolved through sincere dialogue by 
all parties concerned; sanctions and confrontation can only 
aggravate the tense situation on the Korean peninsula.

<F P=106> [Commentary: "Dialogue is Better Than Confrontation"] </F>
  [Text] These days, the Korean nuclear issue has become the 
focus of much interest and conversation again among officials in 
the United Nations. This March, the Korean nuclear issue, which 
had been going in a positive direction, began to take a sudden 
change due to the differences in views between the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and the DPRK regarding the 
replacement of fuel rods. 
  On 10 June, the IAEA decided to suspend its plan for 
technological coordination with the DPRK on investigating 
plutonium and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. On the other 
hand, the DPRK side announced its decision to immediately 
withdraw from the IAEA. 
  Carrying out busy activities inside and outside the United 
Nations, the United States hopes that the UN Security Council 
will impose sanctions against the DPRK. People have not 
forgotten that the United States repeatedly [words indistinct] 
for this purpose. However, the U.S. assertion failed to win 
recognition from the international community. Many in U.S. 
political and social circles disagree this view. 
  The Chinese delegation [to the United Nations] persistently 
opposed dealing with the Korean nuclear issue at the UN Security 
Council. It also opposed UN Security Council moves to adopt a 
resolution, including sanctions, regarding the issue. 
  The Chinese delegation repeatedly indicated that the United 
States, the IAEA, the DPRK, the ROK should remove differences in 
opinion and solve problems through dialogue and negotiations. 
The Chinese delegation also indicated that threat, blackmail, 
and pressure would not help solve problems, but would bring 
about destructive consequences because they may intensify 
conflict. 
  Based on such principles, when the chairman of the UN 
Security Council announced a statement regarding the Korean 
nuclear issue, the Chinese delegation, in view of the 
contemporary specific situation and proceeding from its 
constructive attitude, immediately clarified the Chinese 
Government's position toward the issue and expressed the hope 
that parties concerned should continue negotiations to seek 
reasonable ways for solving the issue. 
  Facts prove that (?a series of negotiations) for solving the 
Korean nuclear issue, though faced with many difficulities, have 
eventually developed gradually into a positive direction. 
  When the United States and the DPRK made a principled 
agreement in June last year, the DPRK side announced its 
suspension of the unilateral decision to withdraw from the 
Nonproliferation Treaty, NPT. As the DPRK achieved new success 
in negotiations with the IAEA and the United States, on 15 and 
25 June of this year, respectively, inspections of nuclear 
facilites in the DPRK were conducted, and, accordingly, all 
duties were completed. 
  Differences in views and difficulties have been created 
again 
now over the replacement of fuel rods. However, such 
differences in views and difficulties are only momentary. 
Therefore, a certain amount of room and and some possibility 
remains for a solution of the issue. 
  In the Korean nuclear issue, China has persistently adhered 
to two basic goals, namely, the denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula and the preservation of peace and stability on the 
Korean peninsula. This assertion has become the common 
recognition of the member states of the UN Security Council and 
won support from the international community. 
  If relevant parties sincerely make constant efforts to 
acheive these two goals, they can remove differences in their 
views gradually and achieve mutual understanding. 
  The most important thing at the present time is that 
relevant 
parties assume a prudent and patient attitude. There is a 
Chinese proverb which says "When one gets angry one should seek 
reason and when one is in danger one should observe (?decorum)." 
If one clings to sanctions and pressure tenaciously and uses 
rash threat by force of arms simply because of momentary 
(?difficulties), the positive success achieved in the 
negotiations of the (?three parties) will end in failure and 
tension will be aggravated again. 
  The international community does not want to see the 
consequences that may result from closing the door of 
negotiations and will not accept them. The aggravation of the 
situation on the Korean peninsula will not only create a great 
shock in the Northeast Asian region, but also pose a threat to 
world peace and stability. 
  The problem is very grave. Therefore, the parties concerned 
should prudently ponder over it and [words indistinct]. 
  Sanctions and threat are, in actuality, of no use, and 
sincere and patient negotiations are the most reasonable 
measure. Dialogue is better than confrontation.

  [Text] Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party 
committee, received in the Youyi Guest House of Shenyang the 
friendship delegation of North Pyongan Province of DPRK, which 
is headed by Yom Chae-man, chairman of the North Pyongan 
Provincial Administrative and Economic Guidance Committee, on 
the afternoon of 4 June. 
  During the reception, Gu Jinchi first extended warm welcome 
on behalf of the Liaoning Provincial CPC Committee and all 
Communist party members and people throughout the province to 
the visit paid by the Korean delegation. He said: The 
Sino-Korea friendship cemented or fostered personally by the 
elderly proletarian revolutionaries has experienced historic 
trials. Over a long period of time, the peoples of the two 
provinces have made due contributions to the development of 
friendship between the two provinces through mutual assistance 
and support. Hereafter, we will still continue to make all-out 
efforts to enhance the traditional friendship and the friendly 
and cooperative relationship between the two sides. 
  In reviewing his visit paid to the DPRK not long ago, Gu 
Jinchi said: In April this year, the Liaoning provincial CPC 
delegation headed by him paid a visit to the close neighbor of 
DPRK. It was a great honor for the delegation to participate in 
the celebration of the 82d birthday of Chairman Kim Il-song. 
Leaving a deep impression on the delegation were the Korean 
people's high revolutionary enthusiasm and the revolutionary 
spirit of working hard to make progress, as well as the 
tremendous achievements scored by them in the undertakings of 
building socialism. He was convinced that under the wise 
leadership of Chairman Kim Il-song and the Workers' Party of 
Korea, the diligent and brave Korean people will certainly be 
able to score a new and greater achievement in the future in the 
undertakings of socialist revolution and construction. 
  During the reception, Chairman Yom Chae-man also made a 
speech in which he extended thanks for the commendation. He 
said: As soon as it set foot in China, the delegation deeply 
felt the profound sentiment and friendship displayed by the 
Chinese people to the Korean people. Through the two-day visit, 
the delegation saw for itself the tremendous achievements scored 
by the Chinese people under the wise leadership of the CPC in 
the undertakings of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. This has fully shown that the line currently 
followed by China is in conformity with China's reality. He 
wholeheartedly wished the people of Liaoning Province to score 
still greater achievements in the undertakings of revolution and 
construction along with people throughout China. 
  After the reception, Gu Jinchi hosted a banquet in honor of 
the Korean delegation. 
  Attending the reception and banquet were Xu Wencai, member 
of 
the provincial party standing committee and secretary general of 
the provincial party committee; Sui Xudong, director of the 
provincial foreign affairs office; and other personnel concerned.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, June 15 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
Kampuchea Party (DKP), or Khmer Rouge, has agreed to fully 
support a cease fire proposed by Cambodia's King Norodom 
Sihanouk. 
  The declaration was made by Chan Youran, the head of a DKP 
delegation to a round table meeting of a peace working committee 
which opened at the royal palace Phnom Penh this morning under 
the chairmanship of Nhiek Tioulong, the representative of the 
king. 
  Chan Youran said: "Our nation and people are definitely 
tired 
of war. Continuing it would only make the situation in Cambodia 
worse." 
  However, the DKP delegation did not agree the deadline of 
June 30 for the cease fire which was proposed by the government 
and national assembly at today's meeting. 
  Chan said mutual concessions and compromises should be made 
through discussions as suggested by the king. "On that common 
basis, we will discuss what the DKP should hand over to the 
royal government and what the government should in turn give to 
the DKP." he said.

<F P=106> [By Zhang Yu'an: "First National Border Trade Fair Will </F>
Open in Pingxiang in July"] 
  [Text] The country's first national border trade fair will 
be held from July 26 to August 2 in Pingxiang in Guangxi Zhuang 
Autonomous Region. 
  The organizers of the fair hope to further promote border 
trade and economic co-operation between China and Vietnam as 
well as other Southeast Asian countries, Liang Yuxiang, a senior 
official of Pingxiang, said last week. Liang is also executive 
director of the fair's organizing committee. 
  Liang noted that Pingxiang shares a 97-kilometre-long border 
with Vietnam, has direct rail and highway links with Vietnam 
through the Friendship Pass, and is only 187 kilometres from 
Hanoi. 
  This places Pingxiang in a favourable position for 
developing 
border trade and economic co-operation with Vietnam, Liang said. 
  To make full use of the opportunity, more than 1,000 Chinese 
firms will offer overseas participants in the fair about 300 
co-operation projects, in addition to displaying various 
commodities and technologies. 
  The organizers are also considering organizing delegations 
of 
Chinese business managers to visit Vietnam after the fair. 
  Vietnam will send a 150-person delegation, representing more 
than 40 enterprises, to the fair. Liang expects that individual 
Vietnamese visitors will far outnumber the official delegation. 
  At the fair, the Vietnamese will exhibit sedan cars, 
motorbikes and air-conditioners that are assembled or 
manufactured in Vietnam by foreign companies. The Vietnamese 
will also display their own mineral, rubber and aquatic products. 
  Entrepreneurs from Thailand Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, 
Macao and Taiwan will also participate in the fair in order to 
tap new business opportunities, Liang said. 
  Since the United States has lifted its trade embargo on 
Vietnam, this Southeast Asian country is attracting more foreign 
investment and creating more business opportunities. 
  Thus, Liang noted, Chinese enterprises will be able to find 
co-operation and investment opportunities in Vietnam in addition 
to border trade.

  [Text] New Delhi, June 12 (XINHUA) -- China and India will 
discuss the ways and means for expanding bilateral trade when 
the fifth meeting of the Sino-Indian Joint Team for Economic and 
Trade Affairs takes place here this week. 
  A 12-member Chinese delegation led by Minister of Foreign 
Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi will arrive here on Tuesday 
[14 June] for the meeting. 
  Apart from the official delegation, the Chinese minister 
will 
bring with her a Chinese businessmen team consisting of chairmen 
of major Chinese trading corporations. 
  The Chinese businessmen will interact with their Indian 
counterparts to tap the great potential of bilateral trade 
between the two countries. 
  During her three-day stay here, Wu Yi is scheduled to meet 
Indian Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee, Finance Minister 
Manmohan Singh, Minister of State for Steel S.M. Dev and 
Minister of State for Coal A.K. Panja. 
  She is also likely to meet Indian Prime Minister Narasimha 
Rao, according to informed sources here. 
  Hu Guocai, head of the Chinese advance team which arrived 
here on Saturday for the preparation of the forthcoming meeting, 
said today that there is great scope for expanding bilateral 
trade between the two most populous nations in the world. 
  Two-way trade between India and China, which has been 
developing fast over recent years, totalled 670 million U.S. 
dollars last year, nearly doubling that of the previous year, Hu 
said. 
  "At the meeting, we will focus on further development of 
bilateral trade through setting up more joint ventures and 
transferring technologies," he said.

  [Text] New Delhi, June 15 (XINHUA) -- A trade delegation 
led by Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation Wu Yi arrived here early this morning to explore the 
ways and means of expanding Sino-Indian bilateral trade. 
  Wu Yi, who is on a three-day visit to India at the 
invitation 
of the Indian Commerce Ministry, will attend the fifth meeting 
of the Sino-Indian Joint Team for Economic and Trade Affairs 
which is taking place in a few hours. 
  The two sides "will discuss matters of common interest 
relating to economic, trade and technological cooperation 
between the two countries," she said at the airport. 
  The joint team was set up after late Indian Prime Minister 
Rajiv Gandhi visited China in 1988 to promote bilateral trade 
between the two countries. 
  The two countries will sign the minutes of talks and the 
protocol on trade for 1994-95 at the conclusion of the one-day 
meeting of the joint team. 
  During her stay here, she will meet Indian Prime Minister 
Narasimha Rao, Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee, Finance 
Minister Manmohan Singh, Minister of State for Steel S.M. Dev, 
Minister of State for Coal A. Panja as well as Minister of State 
for Petroleum Captain S. Sharma. 
  Traveling with her is a 11-member team of businessmen from 
Chinese trading corporations dealing with silk, livestock, 
mineral products and metallurgy. 
  The Chinese chief executives will interact directly with 
their Indian counterparts to look for more opportunities of 
business and cooperation. 
  Bilateral trade between India and China totaled 670 million 
U.S. dollars last year with a surplus of 157 million dollars in 
favor of India. China imports large quantities of iron ore, 
steel, hides and skins from India and exports silk to it 
annually.

  [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President 
Rong Yiren and Vice-Premier Qian Qichen both met separately here 
today with 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, special envoy of Yemeni 
president 'Ali 'Abdullah Salih. 
  A Chinese Foreign Ministry official said that Rong and Qian, 
who is also foreign minister, exchanged views with ghani on the 
current situation in Yemen. 
  Rong said China pays much attention to the development of 
the 
situation there and is deeply concerned about the large 
casualties and damage to life and production facilities caused 
by the massive military conflicts there. 
  He said China hopes that the parties concerned, putting the 
people's interests first, will cease firing as soon as possible 
and seek settlement of the problem through peaceful negotiations. 
  Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Told 'Abd-al-Ghani 
that China, having good relations with Yemen, hopes to see 
unity, stability, prosperity and development in Yemen. 
  He said China never interferes in other countries' internal 
affairs and respects the choice of their people. 
  Qian noted that the continuation of fighting is not helpful 
to the settlement of the problem at all and, on the contrary, 
will complicate the situation. 
  He believed that the Yemeni people will be able to solve 
their problem peacefully through negotiations, and restore peace 
and stability at an early date. 
  'Abd-al-Ghani, a member of the Yemeni Presidential Council,

in a peaceful way so as to maintain Yemen's unification.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis": by Zhou Zexin and Huang Pengnian: "Africa </F>
Facing New Challenges"] 
  [Text] Tunis, June 12 (XINHUA) -- The forthcoming summit of 
the Organization of African Unity opens Monday [13 June] against 
the background of some far-reaching development in Africa. 
While the African continent traversed some of the most 
difficult times in the last year, it also witnessed moments of 
triumph and hope. 
  The Cairo Declaration adopted by the OAU in June last year 
on 
the establishment of the mechanism to resolve African disputes 
peacefully represented a landmark achievement of the 
organization in the political sphere. 
  The treaty establishing the African Economic Community, that 
came into effect last month, was the first step Africa has taken 
toward economic integration and it is expected to have a 
significant impact on the revitalization of the African economy. 
  The summit also acquires its special significance as it 
comes 
in the wake of the first all-race elections in South Africa, and 
the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as its president. 
  Reforms to end apartheid in Pretoria have brought about 
world 
acceptance and South Africa was formally welcomed as the newest 
member of the OAU on May 25. 
  But there are new challenges that the African continent is 
still facing. 
  Despite the political and economic progress in the past 
year, 
some African countries are still suffering from war and domestic 
disputes. 
  The conflict in Rwanda has shocked the world by its scale, 
brutality and savagery, which is expected to call urgent 
attention of the African leaders. 
  Besides, the accumulated crucial economic and social 
problems 
are hindering development of the African countries. 
  Over the recent years, African countries suffered greatly 
from the low prices of primary commodities in the international 
markets. The 53 OAU member states are struggling with growing 
foreign debts, which in 1993 amounted to 302 billion U.S. 
dollars, or three times the figure in 1980. 
  The unfavorable trade balance in 1993 reached as high as 1.6 
billion U.S. dollars. In Africa alone, 33 belong to the 47 
least developed countries in the world. 
  Perhaps more devastating are Africa's exploding population, 
which now totals nearly 700 million. According to OAU 
estimates, at the region's current average annual growth rate of 
3.1 percent, Africa's population will reach approximately 1 
billion by the year 2005. 
  In the early years of the decade of the 1990s, the annual 
average growth rate of the GDP (gross domestic product) has been 
a mere 1.5 percent. This is barely half of the African 
population growing the trend of continuing decline in per capita 
income and a further slide into poverty in Africa. 
  It is evident that the most pressing issue is the resolution 
of ethnic tension and conflict throughout the African continent. 
And the second most important problem is finding ways and means 
of combating the rising tide of economic problems. 
  African conflicts and economic development will top the list 
of concern on the agenda of the OAU summit from June 13 to 15. 
  Given the changing international situation, it has become 
increasingly important for African countries to maintain 
political stability for the benefit of economic development. 
  In that light, the issue of assuring security for economic 
development will appear to be the main theme of the African 
summit.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Gu Zhenqiu: "Can Abiola Succeed in </F>
Forming Another Government?"] 
  [Text] Lagos, June 11 (XINHUA) -- Tension is enveloping 
Nigeria as Moshood Abiola, widely believed to have won the 
annulled presidential polls on June 12 last year, repeatedly 
threatened to form a rival government with himself as "president 
of Nigeria." 
  The threat came as the Nigerian Military Government, headed 
by General Sani Abacha, is making painstaking efforts to explain 
its position that the route of the national constitutional 
conference is the best option for resolving the nation's current 
crisis. 
  The constitutional conference is the conception hammered out 
by the Abacha administration shortly after it took power in mid- 
November last year. 
  In an obvious change in his declared hardline position, 
Abiola announced Friday [10 June] night the postponement of his 
swear-in ceremony scheduled for Sunday. 
  In his letter to the National Democratic Coalition (Nadeco), 
a new opposition group in Nigeria, Abiola said, "As a man who 
respects the religious beliefs of our people and based on the 
unanimous advice of our leaders of Nadeco, I confirm to you the 
postponement of the swearing-in ceremony." 
  However, Abiola's shift does not necessarily mean the 
disappearance of his former threats. Local press reports said 
today that the swearing-in ceremony may come up at 2:00 P.M. 
(local time) on June 13. 
  But the question is, "Can Abiola unilaterally proclaim 
himself president when there is the military government in 
power? Or put it simply, can Abiola become a rebel by taking up 
arms to defend his mandate?" 
  His action will result in a confrontation as the Nigerian 
military is under the control of the Abacha administration. 
  Asked how he would be sworn-in when Abacha is in control of 
the military, Abiola told the press that the Nigerians will know 
later whether the military is backing Abacha. 
  However, such braggings of Abiola are not powerful enough to 
convince his supporters that he is ready to take any risk to 
uphold what they called the mandate. 
  Skepticism about Abiola's plans is widespread in the West 
African country. 
  Unwilling to see their motherland plagued by a series of 
political crisis, more and more Nigerians prefer that the 
current crisis in the nation be settled in a peaceful way. 
  The former Nigerian military regime, headed by General 
Ibrahim Babangida, annulled the June 12 presidential poll last 
year and plunged the nation into a political crisis. 
  After the annulment, Abiola launched an unsuccessful 
campaign, which took him to the United States and some European 
countries, trying to have the military decision reversed. 
  Last July, thousands of Nigerians took to the streets of 
Lagos to protest the Babangida administration's decision to 
annul the first presidential poll in a decade in Nigeria. 
  But now, the Nigerians largely adopted a lukewarm attitude 
towards the anti-government calls from the opposition groups. 
  Moreover, there is no indication that those organizations, 
which supported Abiola last year, are prepared to back him at 
present. 
  On the eve of the first anniversary of the annulled 
presidential polls, the Nigerian military and police forces 
moved to beef up security in Lagos. 
  Which way will Abiola take? Will he be faithful to his 
pledge to form a government? 
  The Nigerian police is waiting to see what Abiola will do in 
the next few days.

<F P=106> ["Feature" by Gu Zhenqiu and Xiong Mingshan: "Calm </F>
Atmosphere Prevails in Lagos"] 
  [Text] Lagos, June 12 (XINHUA) -- Calmness and tranquillity 
today greet the first anniversary of the annulled presidential 
election in the Nigerian commercial and financial capital of 
Lagos. 
  The traffic is light as the residents are enjoying their 
weekend in the city, which is well known for its bustle and 
hustle traffic movement during the weekdays. 
  Armed police are seen manning strategic points in the 
metropolis. 
  On the lawn patches near the national theater, Nigerian kids 
and youngsters are playing football, one of the most popular 
sports game in the West African nation. 
  Nigerian head of State General Sani Abacha said in his 
broadcast to the whole nation this morning that his government 
is determined to seek the successful implementation of the 
agenda of the proposed national constitutional conference, 
slated for June 27. 
  Meanwhile, he also warned against any act to endanger the 
peace and security in the nation, saying that saboteurs would be 
sternly punished. 
  A young Nigerian woman, who identified herself as a high 
school student, said Abacha's broadcast "is not specific." 
  "If only he (Abacha) can identify those bad elements in our 
society," she said. 
  On Awolowo Road, a petit peddler told XINHUA, "I know 
nothing 
about Abacha's speech and I do not know (anything) about (the 
fact that Moshood) Abiola was wanted" by the Nigerian Police. 
  "I don't care about politics, but I do care about my 
business 
because my family lives on" the petit business, he said. 
  At a shopping center near the American Embassy in Nigeria, a 
Nigerian Army soldier named Alassan said Abiola "Is doing 
something at a wrong time." 
  "You see, the election was annulled a year ago by the 
(General Ibrahim) Babangida administration, but one year later 
Abiola still insists (on) the restoration of the election," he 
said, adding that "I think he's joking." 
  Asked about what he will do if Abiola is standing before 
him, 
he said calmly, "The fact is that Abiola is missing now. But if 
he is standing before me, I'll arrest him and I think he'll be 
tried." 
  "You can't establish a government within the government 
headed by General Abacha," he said, "That's why Abiola's action 
is viewed as treason." 
  Meanwhile, Alassan said if he arrested Abiola or had the 
information which leads to his arrest, "I will be 50,000 (naira) 
richer." 
  However, no information so far is available to confirm 
whether the Nigerian police have promised to offer a reward of 
50,000 naira (about 2,270 U.S. dollars at the official exchange 
rate). 
  Abiola, widely believed to have won the annulled 
presidential 
election last year, repeatedly threatened to form a rival 
government with him as "the president of Nigeria." 
  While declaring Abiola wanted, the Nigerian Police on 
Saturday [11 June] asked the general public with information of 
his whereabouts to come forward with such information.

  [Text] Beijing, 14 Jun (XINHUA) -- Elaborating on the 
significance of conducting national defense education at a 
founding ceremony of the selection committee for the National 
Defense Quiz Competition Organizing Committee today, Chi 
Haotian, state councillor and concurrently national defense 
minister, emphatically pointed out that the more we want 
stability, development, and to live and work in peace and 
contentment, the more we should value national defense 
education, understand the meanings of being vigilant in peace 
time and the danger of being unaware of warfare, and enhance the 
awareness required to safeguard our motherland's security, 
ensure national development, and safeguard national interests. 
  The National Quiz Competition on National Defense Campaign 
is 
sponsored by such units as the Science Dissemination 
Association, the All-China Writers' Association, and the State 
Commission of Science, Technology, and Industry for National 
Defense. The campaign's purpose is to promote national defense 
education for the nation and to enhance people's national 
defense awareness. Zhang Zhen, Central Military Commission vice 
chairman, and others met with attendees of the ceremony. Also 
present at the meeting were Yu Yongbo, General Political 
Department director, and others. 
  Chi Haotian called this competition an event of great 
significance. He said: The CPC Central Committee, the State 
Council, and the Central Military Commission attach great 
importance to national defense education for the nation; make 
the strengthening of national defense education and enhancing of 
people's national defense awareness a strategic task facing the 
entire party, military, and governments at all levels. In a 
complicated and turbulent international situation, a nation will 
not stand up without national defense and people will feel 
uneasy without soldiers' protection. A state must be equipped 
with national defense and become rich through building up its 
military power. China not only needs to accelerate its 
development, but needs to ensure its security. For development, 
we need to do a good job in economic construction; and for 
security, we need to strengthen national defense construction. 
A booming economy and strong national defense are the two key 
pillars -- representing fundamental national interests -- on 
which China relies on to stand on its own feet in the world. 
Consideration must be given to both economic and national 
defense development. We should strengthen national defense 
education focusing on outlooks on warfare, national security and 
interests and national defense knowledge; earnestly study Mao 
Zedong thought on the military and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
thinking of army-building in a new era; enhance awareness of 
national defense; and create a fine social custom that the whole 
nation is concerned with national defense construction and 
everyone takes his responsibilities and does his bit for 
constructing and strengthening national defense. 
  Chi Haotian said: To strengthen national education on 
national defense is a way to pluck up the national spirit and is 
of great significance in promoting social stability and economic 
development. National defense education yields not only military 
efficiency, but also economic and social efficiency as well. 
Patriotism, revolutionary heroism, a national spirit that 
constantly strives to become stronger, and a selfless and 
devoted revolutionary spirit, as well as a cohesive force that 
strengthens the nation's unity, generated from a strong 
awareness of national defense, can be transformed as combat 
effectiveness and economic productive forces, thereby creating a 
stable and fine social environment for developing the national 
economy and maintaining long-term stability.

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Xudong (3769 2485 2639) and Ma Mingjie </F>
(7456 2494 3381): "When Contributing Royalties, Deng Xiaoping's 
Daughter Xiao Rong Says All Members of Her Family Are Concerned 
About the Hope Project"] 
  [Text] On the afternoon of 7 June, Xiao Rong, author of 
My Father Deng Xiaoping, came to the China Youth Fund 
to contribute 15,000 yuan to the Hope Project to help some 50 
pupils deprived of education in Yimeng Shan. The money had been 
paid to the author by a publishing company in Shandong to 
compensate for the loss of royalties resulting from copyright 
infringement of the book My Father Deng Xiaoping. 
  Xu Yongguang, secretary general of the China Youth Fund, 
expressed his thanks to Xiao Rong, saying: When we put on a 
benefit performance in January this year, we made a point of 
fetching some children from Bose, who had received aid from 
Comrade Xiaoping, to report their study achievements at the 
Great Hall of the People to grandpa Deng Xiaoping. 
  Xiao Rong said: The aided children in Bose wrote a letter to 
father in 1992, and he was very pleased to read it. Out of 
curiosity, she asked how the fund had determined that the 
donation had come from her father because it was made clear at 
the time of the donation that no name should be given and that 
it should be given in the name of "an old communist party 
member." Xiao asked with humor whether it was the comrades who 
presented the money who had "divulged the secret." Xu explained 
that they had been tightlipped and that the matter had been 
clarified only through inquiries in many quarters. 
  Xiao Rong laughed and said: All of our family members are 
concerned about the Hope Project. Mother has made many 
donations to the Hope Project. At the beginning of this year, 
she received over 4,000 yuan in back pay, which she contributed 
to the Hope Project without disclosing her real name. At the 
dinner table, mother also frequently calls on other family 
members to contribute money to the Hope Project. When I made a 
donation this time, she repeatedly said "fine" and encouraged me 
to make more donations if there was such an opportunity. 
  Xiao Rong praised the method of "one helping one" in the 
Hope 
Project, saying that it was so easy to supervise and so highly 
transparent that donors could set their minds at rest. 
  Everybody is very much concerned about Comrade Xiaoping. 
Xiao Rong said: Father is 90 years old this year but he is not 
suffering from any illness [dan mei you bing 0141 3093 2589 
4016] and he is in very good health.

  [Text] Beijing, June 15 (AFP) -- Chinese dissident Wang 
Dan began a 48-hour hunger strike at his home here Wednesday to 
protest police harrassment and the government's refusal to 
democratise China's political system. "I have had enough of 
being constantly watched in contempt of the law, and I want to 
stand up for my rights," the former student leader of the 1989 
pro-democracy movement said by telephone. He added that he was 
also protesting the government's indifference to appeals from 
the Chinese people for more democracy. A number of petitions 
sent to the authorities by dissident groups. [sentence as 
received] 
  Wang, 24, was freed in 1993 after spending four years in 
prison. He said Tuesday that he would begin a fast unless the 
police presence around him was removed by Wednesday night. He 
said he feared for his safety, adding that two plain clothes 
police followed him everywhere, and that four or five others 
were stationed day and night in front of his building. 
  Wang returned here Sunday from the eastern province of 
Shandong. He decided to leave the capital for the fifth 
anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre on June 4, in order to 
"avoid police harassment." At the end of May, the dissident 
signed a petition with six other people, protesting the 
treatment of those involved in the 1989 pro-democracy movement 
and calling for the release of all those detained. A number of 
petitions and open letters have been sent to the government this 
year by dissidents and intellectuals pushing for more democracy. 
But the government has responded by intensifying repression, 
arresting many dissident leaders and putting others under 
intense police surveillance.

  [Text] Beijing, June 15 (XINHUA) -- China's publication of 
the "Delhi Declaration" demonstrates the Chinese Government's 
determination to basically popularize nine-year compulsory 
education and eliminate illiteracy among middle-aged and young 
people by 2000. 
  This is also a part of carrying out international promises, 
a 
spokesman from China's State Education Commission told XINHUA 
here today. 
  On December 16 last year, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing 
attended the nine-nation education-for-all summit in New Delhi 
and signed the declaration together with the leaders and 
representatives from the other eight countries, Bangladesh, 
Brazil, Egypt, Indonesia, India, Mexico, Nigeria and Pakistan. 
  China published the "Delhi Declaration" today. 
  In the Delhi Declaration, the leaders of these nine highly 
populated developing countries reaffirmed their commitment to 
meeting the basic learning needs of all their people by making 
primary education universal. 
  The spokesman said that the publication of the declaration 
in 
China would promote the reform and development of the nation's 
education agenda.

<F P=106> ["Satisfaction With CPC Is Declining--A Survey on </F>
Ideological Conditions Among University Students After 4 June 
Incident"] 
  [Text] [Editor's note] At the time of the fifth 
anniversary of the "4 June incident," the CPC authorities kept a 
close watch on the ideological trends among the college students 
in Beijing. Two months before "4 June," the CPC Central 
Committee instructed the State Education Commission and the 
Communist Youth League Central Committee to jointly carry out 
"an analysis of the current conditions of college students," to 
understand the current ideological conditions and 
characteristics of college students. The "analysis of the 
current conditions of college students" is summarized below. 
[end editor's note] 
  Compared with other social groups in contemporary society, 
today's college students are still a group which is very 
idealistic and politically sensitive and is characterized more 
by belief and aspirations. 
<H5>  A Group Which Is Ideal and Diversified in Development </H5>
  Compared with the college students in an earlier period, 
today's college students exhibit the features of diversity in 
thinking, choice, and the problems they face. In concrete 
terms, at present, the number of students who want to "learn 
some practical knowledge" has increased, reaching 84.9 percent; 
at the same time, 60 percent of them are still interested in 
major international and domestic issues and news but their focus 
on politics, the channel through which they care about politics, 
and the style with which they do so have changed and shifted. 
<H5>  Eager To Work Part-Time and Fall in Love </H5>
  Judged superficially, college students today have obviously 
become more pragmatic in all areas and at different levels. In 
the area of study, students are quite vigorous. Most students 
have a "broad" understanding of "study," saying that "reading 
books is study but using knowledge is a more important study 
method." In terms of behavior, they have already jumped out of 
"books." Absence from class, being late for class, and leaving 
before class is finished are spreading phenomena. The "craze 
for going abroad" among students has declined a bit but is 
basically in a condition of steady development. On campus, a 
"craze for becoming capable people" is taking shape. However, 
as regards the criteria for a qualified person and how one can 
become a capable person, useful to society and needed by the 
country, students have an understanding and behavior very 
different from the traditional modes. In the area of politics, 
discussions on political problems, as well as expressing and 
exchanging ideas, have decreased, and there is little deep 
pondering and research. Thus, there is no clear sign of any 
emerging political ideological trend and there is a certain 
degree of indifference and apathy. 
  In the area of daily behavior, last year, the phenomenon of 
students breaking the law and discipline was frequently seen. 
The number of lawbreaking and discipline-violating cases was 
four or five times that in the previous year and the most acute 
phenomenon was "fighting and beating." The "love wind" was 
constantly blowing. During last summer, about one-third of 
students worked amid the "work craze." 
<H5>  The Sense of "Ego" Swells </H5>
  Judged psychologically, most students are currently in the 
"individualizing" condition and their senses of "ego" and of 
being an individual are gradually becoming explicit and clear. 
This is mainly illustrated by the following three points: 1) 
When they choose a mode of behavior, they mainly or solely ask 
"whether it is beneficial to myself" or "whether I can obtain 
benefit from it." 2) In the area of politics, they cannot 
resist the temptation and about two-thirds of students show 
great interest in and enthusiasm for the major international and 
domestic political issues. 3) In daily life, their 
psychological condition and concepts are in a rather seriously 
unbalanced state. 
  From the above descriptions we can see inconsistency and a 
great deal of contradiction between the superficial phenomenon 
of students and their psychological condition. The use of 
traditional viewpoints and angles to observe and analyze 
students' superficial problems will easily slip into an impasse 
characterized by puzzlement and confusion. 
  Judged from a static perspective, that is, from the current 
conditions, the basic situation among college students is quite 
optimistic. They are still fully confident and hopeful about 
the future and still want very much to train themselves into 
"people useful to the society," wanting to do great things. 
They show a higher degree of care for politics. For example, 
about 73 percent of the college students in the Beijing area 
said that they are "very concerned" or "quite concerned" with 
"Comrade Deng Xiaoping's inspection tour to the south" and "the 
14th CPC National Congress," 95.8 percent of them agree that 
"economic development needs a stable political environment," and 
76 percent of them thought that the central authorities have 
scored results, or havve "obtained marked effect," or "scored 
initial result" in "stabilizing the political situation." 

<H5>    Mammonism Has a Certain Market on Campus </H5>
  However, judged from a dynamic perspective, that is, from 
the 
situation of development and changes, there is something to 
worry about. Judged from the students' job choices, mammonism 
has a certain market on campuses. "High income" has already 
jumped from second and third choice in several previous surveys 
to first choice and "giving full play to individual specialties" 
has dropped from first to second choice. Judged from the 
psychological condition of the students, although they think 
that the future is full of promise, about half of them "do not 
know exactly what to do in the future." When 1993 is compared 
with 1992, the degree of satisfaction felt by students toward 
the relevant work in schools is decreasing, generally by over 20 
percent; the degree of satisfaction toward the work done by the 
central authorities in recent years has also decreased by over 
15 percent. 
  The main current among today's college students is good, 
positive, and upwardly mobile. This is mainly manifested in the 
following: 
<H5>  Some 75 Percent of Students Think That People Should Have </H5>
Belief 
  1. In the area of outlook on life, all college students hope 
that they can become people who are viewed by others as "useful 
persons," "successful persons," or "persons who can accomplish a 
lot of things." Although they have different criteria regarding 
"success," (making contributions to society or making themselves 
happier and freer); although they have different choices of 
channels to "success," (such as "going to the mountain," "going 
to the sea," carrying out theoretical research, or engaging in 
actual operations), most students have a positive outlook on 
life; and the degree of "waiting" is decreasing and the sense of 
"struggle" is increasing. A survey in Beijing shows 73 percent 
of students strongly advocate that "people should have belief" 
and 50 percent of students do not agree with the viewpoint 
"enjoying without delay." Many college students throughout the 
country gave similar answers. The "craze for becoming a capable 
person" has quietly emerged. Nearly 70 percent of students 
thought that "university students should become builders of 
socialism." 
<H5>  Not Caring About Politics, Caring Only About Immediate </H5>
Interests 
  2. In the area of politics, although one-third of students 
have the concept that "it is better to be indifferent to 
politics" and two-thirds of them feel that "at present, most 
people do not care about politics but care only about immediate 
interests," two-thirds of students are still very interested in 
international and domestic political issues, toward which they 
show a high degree of concern, and their viewpoints are quite 
correct. For example, 75 percent of students think that 
"China's future is full of promise" and this is particularly 
true after further unfolding of the "anticorruption" work and 
the closing of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee. 
  The minor points regarding students cannot be neglected and 
belittled. These are mainly manifested in: 
<H5>  Feeling That Religious Activity Is "Fun" </H5>
  1. There is an increasing number of students who feel that 
religious activity is "fun," who have a certain interest in 
religion, and who have varying degrees of religious belief. 
According to information, there is a certain number of students 
who go to church on Sunday but only a few of them really have 
firm religious belief. 
  2. Among students, the number of those who agree with the 
"tendency to become the same" theory is increasing and the 
number of those who are indifferent to politics is also on the 
rise. According to a survey carried out on the campus of a 
comprehensive university in Beijing, in 1992, 41.9 percent of 
students believed in the "tendency to become the same" theory 
and thought that the socialist and capitalist systems will 
gradually mix together; in 1993, the figure had risen to 51.1 
percent. According to a survey by Beijing Municipality, in 
1986, 11.9 percent of students held the viewpoint that 
"university students should mainly concern themselves with study 
and not with politics and society"; in 1988, this figure dropped 
to 6.2 percent. However, in 1993, 36.8 percent of students held 
the viewpoint that "it is better to be indifferent to politics." 
  3. The phenomenon of psychological imbalance among college 
students is quite general and the condition of psychological 
well-being among students is deteriorating. According to a 
survey done by a college of engineering in Beijing, 34.3 percent 
of students have psychological illness to varying degrees, far 
surpassing the average level (16 percent) in the colleges across 
the country two years ago. 
<H5>  Twenty-Five Percent of University Students Have Premarital </H5>
Sex 
  4. The moral condition of college students is 
"deteriorating." According to a survey of 2,000 students in 20 
universities, about 25 percent of students have had premarital 
sex and this tendency is increasing; according to the heads of 
many student work departments (offices) in higher learning 
institutes, students' morals have sharply declined and cheating 
in exams has become prevalent. 
<H5>  College Students Are Seriously Unbalanced Psychologically </H5>
  Judged from the above analyses, to varying degrees, college 
students have left the "intermediate state" and entered the 
"polar state" or "plural state." That is, activity and 
passivity coexist, stability and agitation occur simultaneously, 
and hope and despair perpetuate together, forming a rather 
seriously conflicting condition. Superficially, campuses do not 
seem to have any "flash points" and "no focus" but, in fact, 
they have "many flash points," "many focuses," and "many 
tendencies," and are in a disorderly state and a psychologically 
unbalanced, and even seriously conflicting, condition.

<F P=106> [By Zhang Mu (1728 3092): "CPC Sets Out Two Major </F>
Principles for Reform and Opening"] 
  [Text] China Has Got Into a Position From Which There Is 
No Turning Back, As If It Was Riding a Tiger; This Will Either 
Do Good or Harm to China and Determine the CPC's Future 
  It is safe to say that mainland China has got into "a 
precarious position from which there is no turning back." Such 
an assessment can apply to both the general political and 
economic situations and the process of reform and opening 
initiated by the CPC leadership. The economic construction and 
in-depth reform are now under way. The 1988 policy of suspending 
construction projects and rectifying economic order will never 
be introduced again. The only way out is to restrain this 
"tiger which has left its den" so that it behaves well. China 
has got into a crucial position with regard to its diplomacy and 
its domestic political situation which will either "do China 
good or harm and determine the CPC's future." The CPC leaders 
are now applying themselves to working out a suitable strategy 
to deal with the situation in an attempt to provide stable 
internal and external environments to enable economic growth to 
follow a steady upward course. 
  A CPC leader said: Last year witnessed rapid economic growth 
and great achievements but we should be aware that there are 
still some difficulties and problems, the main one being too 
great an amount of investment in fixed assets. Deng 
Xiaoping has said too rapid economic growth will get us into 
trouble. The economic growth rate must be appropriate but 
China's current economic growth rate is too high despite the 
macrocontrol. There has never before been such a precedent in 
the world. 
  Some senior CPC leaders recently said that they are most 
afraid of "three major difficulties" which have led to the 
precarious situation I have mentioned. The three major 
difficulties are said to be as follows: "One, excessive capital 
construction and excessive money supply resulting in inflation; 
two, the central government has actually relaxed its grip on the 
shopping basket project and, if we cannot keep the project 
going, how can ordinary people bear the burden brought about by 
price increases in nonstaple food? and three, the reform is at 
a crucial stage and new reform measures must be put into effect 
but some problems will crop up in the process of reform." 
Clearly the fact that these three problems have become 
entangled makes it more difficult to straighten things out. 
<H5>  Two Major Principles for Reform and Opening </H5>
  The problems which call for immediate solution are how to 
carry out unified government decrees, how to achieve concerted 
action, and how to coordinate the demands and plans of the 
various central departments and localities for stepping up their 
own development while promoting reform and opening up. Each 
usually has its reasons for development, makes its own analysis 
of the situation, and has its own strengths and special needs. 
Deng's speech, made during his south China tour, which calls 
for rapid development, also makes it all the more difficult to 
achieve full communication between the higher and lower levels 
and to persuade every unit to keep in step with the central 
authorities. 
  The CPC policy decisionmaking body has set out, after 
study, two principles for reform and opening up: First, the 
reform policy must be in the interests of the majority and 
second, the reform policy must take into account the tolerance 
of the majority. 
  The first principle means any reform policy must be 
beneficial to the majority instead of causing them losses. 
Though it is impossible for a reform policy to bring a benefit 
or the same benefit to everyone, it must bring a benefit to the 
majority. 
  The second principle means the reform policy must be 
acceptable to the majority. If the policy is unacceptable to 
the majority, it must not be put into effect because it will 
certainly meet with a rebuff if it is. 
<H5>  Vice Premier Zhu Rongji Calls for Thinking of Danger in </H5>
Times of Peace 
  Vice Premier Zhu Rongji said: Historical experience has 
told us we must take actual conditions into account in deciding 
which reform policies should be introduced first and which ones 
later and how the reform should be accelerated. The present 
situation is: First, leaders of the central authorities must 
keep a cool head and value the historical experience. Second, 
our present conditions are different from those in 1988. We 
have put many more reform policies into practice and the people 
have much greater tolerance. Third, it should be admitted that 
leaders of a number of localities are prepared for, cherish a 
hope for, and have demanded deepened and accelerated reform. If 
all of us can make a concerted effort to crack several hard 
nuts, we will take an important step forward toward the market 
economy. However, there are a fair number of problems calling 
for attention, some of which are even fairly serious and can 
only be solved with difficulty. For instance, the problem of 
large and medium state-owned enterprises changing their 
operating mechanism; the problem of helping many workers gain 
subsistence; the problem of arousing the peasants' enthusiasm 
for production; the problem of providing outlets for surplus 
rural labor; the problem of promoting ideological and cultural 
progress; the problem of fostering a healthy citizenry; and the 
problem of maintaining social order. There are also quite a few 
additional concerns. Thus, we must think of danger in 
peacetime and must not relax our vigilance in the face of the 
excellent situation. We must be aware of the existing problems 
and do our work in a meticulous and sound way. 

    The CPC leadership has really achieved remarkable results in 
this respect. All unauthorized construction projects, 
development zones, and stock and futures markets have been 
closed down. The malpractice of arbitrarily increasing the 
prices of agricultural, sideline, native, and special products, 
which easily trigger buying sprees; the various means of raising 
funds; the setting up of renamed companies; the official 
racketeering; and smuggling activities were all held in check. 
The macrocontrol from top to bottom and government decrees were 
carried out more smoothly than before. Improvements were also 
made in the tax reform, slowing down economic growth, improving 
the economic efficiency of state firms, and adjusting investment 
volume. 
<H5>  Stabilizing the Situation and Solving Contradictions </H5>
  When meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir in 
Beijing in mid-May, CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin especially 
mentioned the "4 June" incident, stressing that the original 
verdict of the incident remains unchanged and that a bad thing 
has been changed into a good thing, namely, the development and 
stability over the last few years. Jiang, who was personally 
elevated by Deng as the core of the third generation of the 
central leadership and who has been in this position for five 
years, was duty-bound to reiterate Deng's line and major policy 
decisions to clarify various rumors and misunderstandings. 
  The factors and the three major problems mentioned above 
have 
resulted in more social contradictions and destabilizing factors 
on the mainland such as unemployment in urban and rural areas, 
the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural 
prices, price increases, unauthorized charges, white slips as 
IOU's, debt chains, the big gap between the rich and the poor, 
disparity in income, social disorder, the splitting up of 
different social groups, conflicts of interest, controversies, 
corruption, and unhealthy tendencies in society. However, the 
CPC leadership has stated with certainty that some destabilizing 
factors are unavoidable but they will not result in a great 
turmoil. 
<H5>  Uphold the Six Musts and Nevers Principle and Stick to the </H5>
Main Theme 
  However, the CPC has spared no efforts to bring the 
situation 
under control. They have seen to it that the media pay a 
guiding role and that propaganda and ideological work is subject 
to and serves the central task, namely, economic development. 
Ideological work must be subject to economic and political 
needs. While ideological education cannot solve all problems, 
it can achieve something. If the authorities make sure that the 
media plays a good guiding role, it is possible to solve 
contradictions, undo puzzles, coordinate relations, allay 
resentment and, thus, create a united, stable, and harmonious 
society. The CPC has also advanced a "six must's and six 
never's" principle for the media to follow, namely: One, they 
must be helpful and never make trouble; two, must stick to the 
main theme and never "make noises"; three, must take social 
results into account and never forget all moral honor at the 
sight of profits; four, must abide by propaganda discipline and 
never have their own way; five, must "concentrate on the central 
task" and never "disperse their strength"; and six, must make 
every effort to carry out the party's policies to the letter and 
never blow success out of proportion. 
  Again, the CPC authorities have also taken measures to 
strengthen market control, check price jumps, crack down on 
speculators. In the meantime, they have continued to improve 
all facets of public security, check corruption, promote 
education and strengthen school management, resettle unemployed 
workers, and energetically support poor areas in the countryside 
with a view to alleviating contradictions and nipping evil in 
the bud. 
<H5>  Focus on Key Points and Never Surpass Three Economic Targets </H5>
  The CPC leadership is gratified by the economic situation 
and 
the results of reform in the first four months of this year. 
The fiscal, tax, and financial reforms have proceeded normally 
without a major hitch. The "trend of increasing prices" once 
seen in the market has been brought under control and prices 
declined notably in April. The difficulties in agricultural 
development such as bottlenecks in energy and communications, 
which present great restrictions on economic growth, and 
excessive investment, however, remain unsolved. 
  The CPC authorities stressed the need not to surpass the 
economic targets set by Premier Li Peng in his government work 
report: One, economic growth rate is to be kept at 9 percent; 
two, fixed assets investment kept at 1,300 billion yuan; and 
three, the general index of national retail prices kept within 
10 percent. According to these targets, industrial growth is 
only allowed to hit 11 percent or below. However, China's 
industrial growth rate in the first quarter was 18 percent and 
in quite a few areas enterprises are still competing with each 
other for more and larger projects and greater speed. The 1994 
growth rate of fixed assets investment is to be kept at 9 
percent but the investment made by state departments and 
enterprises rose by more than 40 percent during the first 
quarter and the retail prices in large and medium cities are 
likely to soar at any moment. Zhu Rongji said: The task 
of solving major contradictions and problems remains tough. The 
problems of excessive construction are still there. If this 
situation continues, it will be harmful to various localities 
and the whole country. He demanded that various localities and 
departments think and act in compliance with the central 
government's major policy decisions, strengthening and improving 
macrocontrol and taking decisive and effective measures to solve 
the problem concerning fixed assets investment. A 
considerable amount of self-provided funds have now exceeded the 
limit set by the regulations on the sources of self-provided 
funds, so it is necessary to strictly define and codify the 
sources of funds. Approval must be obtained before borrowing 
money abroad and sufficient funds must be provided for the key 
projects. 

<H5>    Four Major Measures for Promoting Agricultural Production </H5>
  According to a source, sufficient funds and human and 
material resources have been sent to the construction sites of 
over 100 state key projects and about 1,000 key construction 
projects. The construction of the following projects is being 
speeded up in quality: The irrigation works at the Three Gorges 
and at Xiaolandi on the Huang He; the harnessing of the Huai He 
and Tai Hu; the Beijing-Jiujiang, Baoji-Zhongwei, Houma-Yueshan, 
Nanning-Kunming, Hangzhou-Zhuzhou, and other key rail lines; key 
port projects in Dalian and Shanghai; fiber-optic cables linking 
Beijing with Shenyang, Harbin, Wuhan, and Guangzhou and linking 
Qinghai with Lanzhou and Urumqi; and large coal mines and 
hydraulic and thermal power plants in Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Inner 
Mongolia. The technical transformation in six old major 
industrial cities, including Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Wuhan, 
Dalian and Chongqing is being accelerated. The state has 
decided to inject an additional 15 billion yuan into the six 
cities to accelerate the adjustment of the industrial product 
mix, increase their competitiveness, and keep up their strength 
for further growth. 
  In setting up a modern enterprise system, the central 
government has decided to proceed from reinvigorating individual 
enterprises to enlivening all state enterprise; from granting 
preferential policies to introducing new systems; from carrying 
out enterprise reform to pressing ahead with the whole project 
of establishing a socialist market economy; from allowing no 
state enterprises to go bankrupt to allowing only the best to 
survive; and from discussing principles and directions to 
exploring specific measures. More resolute measures favoring 
agricultural development will be taken. First, increasing 
investment in agriculture and rural economic development 
projects; second, increasing the purchasing prices of grain and 
cotton when new grain goes on sale this year; third, improving 
the special system for stockpiling reserves; and fourth, setting 
up the noncommercial agricultural development bank. 
<H5>  Expand Relations with Foreign Countries To Increase Influence </H5>
  With "Asia fever" on the rise in the world, China's 
development has become all the more spectacular. Jiang Zemin 
said: "China needs the world for its development and vice 
versa. A stable, developed, and strong China will not make any 
threats against other countries; rather, it will make greater 
contributions to peace and development in the world including 
the Asia-Pacific region." 
  Over the last few years, the CPC has achieved great results 
in carrying out Deng Xiaoping's omnidirectional diplomacy. In 
particular, it succeeded in foiling the economic sanctions 
jointly imposed by seven major countries and thus enabled China 
to take an active part in international affairs again. China 
has also increased official contacts, economic cooperation, and 
cultural exchanges with other countries. Statistics show China 
has established diplomatic relations with 158 countries to date. 
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said: China's 
relations with neighboring countries have been consolidated in 
the process of development and the PRC has cemented optimum 
good-neighborly relations with surrounding countries since its 
founding. China has strengthened its solidarity and cooperation 
with the large numbers of developing countries through mutual 
support and has improved and expanded its cooperative relations 
on a mutually beneficial basis through dialogues on an equal 
footing. 
  Since last year, seven members of the CPC Central Committee 
Standing Committee and other senior party, government, and 
military leaders have visited many countries and regions around 
the world to carry out diplomatic activities. State leaders or 
important political figures from: Major Western countries, 
including the United States; surrounding and other Asian 
countries; European and African countries; and Australia have 
also come to China for a visit. The military has also made much 
headway in opening itself to the outside world and in 
establishing ties with its counterparts in foreign countries. 
Over the last few years the military has received military 
delegations from over 40 countries and has sent 120 delegations 
to foreign countries, comprising 1,300 people including the 
defense minister, the chief of general staff, and high-ranking 
military officers. The military also exchanged warship visits 
with foreign countries. Early this year, General Liu Huaqing, 
vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, visited 
Thailand and Indonesia to increase mutual understanding and 
friendship with ASEAN countries, thus opening a new chapter in 
China's military diplomacy. 

<H5>    Great Achievements in Foreign Trade </H5>
  China has made the most conspicuous achievements in 
expanding foreign trade and economic relations. These 
achievements are also unprecedented ones since the CPC gave up 
the policies of closing itself to international intercourse and 
self-reliance. Over the last 15 years, China has approved 
174,000 foreign-funded projects with the actual use of foreign 
funds standing at $60 billion. Last year China approved 83,000 
foreign-funded projects, up 70 percent from the previous year's 
figure, with the actual introduction of foreign funds amounting 
to $25.8 billion, up 130 percent from the previous year's 
corresponding figure. The five special economic zones, the 14 
open coastal cities, the 30 economic and technological 
development zones, the 13 bonded areas, the New Pudong District 
in Shanghai, the coastal economic development zones, the 
capitals of 18 provinces and autonomous regions in the interior, 
and the 13 cities, counties, and towns along the border, have 
formed an initial pattern of comprehensive opening up. Last 
year, China's foreign trade volume hit $195.7 billion, 8.5 times 
that of 1978, and its trade volume jumped from 32d to 11th place 
in the table showing each country's trade volume. 
  According to a commentary in the NEW YORK TIMES, from now 
until the end of this century, China will spend about $560 
billion on capital construction. If American businessmen can 
get one percent of the contracts, this will give hundreds of 
thousands of jobs to American people. Some people have tried to 
revoke China's MFN trading status for human rights reasons but 
this would be "an error of the times" because it would amount to 
the United States pointing a gun to its own head while 
announcing that it was going to press the trigger. 
<H5>  No Rush in Promoting Democracy </H5>
  The CPC stressed the need to take the initiative in dealing 
with the human rights issue. China has taken an active part in 
the publication of the "White Paper on the Human Rights Issue" 
and in the International Conference on Human Rights held by the 
United States in Vienna last year, acting as vice chairman of 
the conference, tabling many proposals to promote global 
economic cooperation and protect the ecological environment, and 
endorsing the Vienna Declaration and Program of Action. When 
visiting northern European countries, Li Ruihuan, Chairman of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National 
Committee, said China respects the international community's 
universal principle on human rights and agrees to the conduct of 
international dialogues on human rights. This is the first time 
a core member of the CPC leadership has made such a statement. 
In the meantime, Li said it is necessary to take into account 
specific conditions in various countries in applying the 
universal principle on human rights. China opposes interference 
in other countries' internal affairs and hopes that various 
countries will respect each other, increase understanding, agree 
to disagree, and make progress together. 
  The CPC's diplomatic strategy is based exactly on Deng 
Xiaoping's instructions: "Two conditions are essential to a 
successful modernization drive: First, favorable internal 
conditions, meaning that we must persist in current reform and 
opening China to the outside world and maintain political 
stability and unity; second, favorable international conditions, 
meaning lasting global peace." Deng maintained that China 
must practice democracy finally but it will not work if we act 
in haste.

  [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- The white paper issued 
today by the State Council's Information Office on intellectual 
property protection in China stresses that China has a 
high-grade legal system for intellectual property protection and 
that intellectual property is effectively protected in the 
country. 
  It cites concrete examples to prove the point, noting that 
the protection of the right to the exclusive use of registered 
trademarks has resulted in the rapid growth of the number of 
trademarks registered by Chinese and foreign businessmen in 
China. 
  By the end of 1993, the number of effective registered 
trademarks had exceeded 410,000. Of these, 350,000 were 
domestic, with the remaining 60,000 coming from 67 countries and 
regions, the white paper says. 
  Companies from the United States had only 122 trademarks 
registered in China before 1979; by 1993 that number had soared 
to 16,221, more than a hundred times the earlier figure, it adds. 
  In 1993, there were 170,000 applications for trademark 
registration in China, including more than 130,000 applications 
for new trademarks registration, among the highest number in the 
world. 
  The patent law has greatly encouraged inventions and other 
creations in China, and has proved to be a magnet to patent 
applications from other countries and regions. By the end of 
1993, the patent office of China had handled over 360,000 
applications for patent rights. Of those, domestic applications 
accounted for 86.4 percent, while 13.6 percent were applications 
from 70 countries and regions. By the end of 1993, 175,000 
patents had been approved. 
  The white paper gives an account of China's laws on 
trademarks, patents, copyrights, technological contracts, and 
scientific and technological progress, as well as the relevant 
government decrees, rules and regulations. 
  The white paper notes that China, in accordance with its 
national conditions and the current tendencies in international 
development, has formulated and fine-tuned various laws and 
regulations on intellectual property protection, thereby 
constructing a socialist legal system for intellectual property 
protection with Chinese characteristics. 
  Meanwhile, says the white paper, the scope of the 
intellectual property rights [IPR] protected in China and the 
degree of protection afforded have gradually conformed with 
international practices. 
  Effective as of March 1983, the Trademark Law and the rules 
for its implementation set forth the principles of application, 
examination and registration in trademark registration 
procedures which are entirely identical with common 
international principles. 
  In 1993, the paper continues, China revised both its 
Trademark Law and the rules for its implementation and made them 
coincide completely with the requirements of GATT's agreement on 
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. 
  The Patent Law and the rules for its implementation came 
into 
effect in April 1985. The Standing Committee of the National 
People's Congress adopted an amendment to the law on September 
4, 1992, which included important revisions. This marked the 
reaching of a new level of patent protection in China, says the 
white paper. 
  As regards the Copyright Law, the paper says, it protects 
computer software in addition to the copyright of written works, 
oral works, music, operas, quyi (folk art forms including ballad 
singing, story telling, comic dialogues, clapper talks, cross 
talks, etc), choreography, works of fine arts, photographs, 
films, TV programs, video tapes, engineering designs, product 
designs and their descriptions, maps, sketch maps and other 
graphic works. 
  China is among a select group of countries that have 
explicitly listed computer software as the object of protection 
by copyright laws, the paper says. 
  The Technological Contract Law and the Law on Scientific and 
Technological Progress, as well as a series of administrative 
regulations concerning intellectual property protection worked 
out by the State Council, together further optimize the nation's 
legal system for the protection of intellectual property rights, 
in the whole bringing the system close to and in coordination 
with international levels of protection. 
  The paper also says that China has a complete legal system 
for the protection of intellectual property rights. China's 
intellectual property law stipulates the legal responsibilities 
to be borne by anyone who violates the law, including civil 
liability, criminal liability and exposure to administrative 
sanctions, it adds.

  [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- China today published a 
12,000-word white paper on its intellectual property protection. 
  Published by the Information Office under the State Council, 
the three-part white paper gives a detailed account of China's 
basic position and attitudes toward intellectual property 
protection, and a systematic introduction to its legislation and 
law enforcement in this regard and China's efforts in fulfiling 
its duties of international intellectual property protection. 
  The paper says that, as a whole, China, however, for a 
variety of historical reasons, began work on its intellectual 
property rights protection system at a comparatively late date. 
  After China started reform and opening to the outside world, 
it accelerated the process of establishing an intellectual 
property rights protection system in order to rapidly develop 
social productive forces, promote overall social progress, meet 
the needs of developing a socialist market economy and expedite 
China's entry into the world economy, says the paper. 
  According to the paper, since the end of the 1970s, China 
has 
done a tremendous amount of effective work in this field, 
covering in a little more than a dozen years a distance which 
took other developed countries scores of years, even a hundred 
years, establishing a relatively comprehensive legal system for 
the protection of intellectual property rights, thereby 
attracting worldwide attention for its achievements not only in 
establishing the system but also in enforcement. 
  The paper says that it is the Chinese Government's view that 
the intellectual property protection system plays a significant 
role in promoting progress in science and technology, enriching 
culture and developing the economy. 
  It adds that it functions both as an important institution 
ensuring the normal running of the socialist market economy and 
as one of the basic environments and conditions for conducting 
international exchange and cooperation in science, technology, 
economy and culture. 
  China considers the protection of intellectual property an 
important part of its policy of reform and opening to the 
outside world and of the building of its socialist legal system, 
the paper says. 
  Since the initiation of the policy of reform and opening to 
the outside world, China has formulated a number of laws, such 
as those on trademark, patent, copyright and combating unfair 
competition, and has been actively involved in the activities of 
world intellectual property organization and other concerned 
international institutions and become member states of related 
international conventions. 
  When reviewing the World Intellectual Property 
Organization's 
past 20 years of cooperation with China, Dr. Arpad Bogsch, 
director-general of the organization, pointed out that "China 
had accomplished all this at a speed unmatched in the history of 
intellectual property protection," the paper recalls. 
  In accordance with its national conditions and current 
tendencies in international development, China has formulated 
and fine-tuned various laws and regulations on intellectual 
property protection, thereby constructing a socialist legal 
system for intellectual property protection with Chinese 
characteristics, says the paper. 
  It concludes that the scope of the intellectual property 
rights protected in China and the degree of protection afforded 
have gradually conformed with international practices and the 
high degree of legal protection for intellectual property rights 
has been realized. 
  The white paper points out that China's Intellectual 
Property 
Law stipulates the legal responsibilities to be borne by anyone 
who violates the law, including civil liability, criminal 
liability and exposure to administrative sanctions. 
  The white paper says that with the implementation of 
intellectual property laws, intellectual property rights are 
effectively protected in China. These laws are also actively 
encouraging invention and other forms of creation and fair 
competition. For instance, the protection of the right to the 
exclusive use of registered trademarks has resulted in the rapid 
growth of the number of trademarks registered by Chinese and 
foreign businessmen in China. The Patent Law of China has 
greatly encouraged inventions and other creations in China, and 
has proved a magnet to patent applications from other countries 
and regions. 
  The third part of the white paper gives a presentation of 
the 
executive system on the protection of intellectual property 
rights, that is, the judicial as well as the administrative 
approaches to the protection of intellectual property rights. 
  In China, any citizen, legal person or any other 
organization 
may appeal to the people's court in accordance with the law upon 
infringement of their rights. They enjoy practical and 
effective judicial protection. The people's court exercises 
judicial authority independently. They submit only to law, 
without interference from any administrative organs, social 
organizations or individuals. 
  The white paper points out that in addition to judicature in 
accordance with international practices, China's system for the 
protection of intellectual property rights comprises the Patent 
Law, the Trademark Law, and the Copyright Law and other 
administrative channels designated in intellectual property 
laws, all proceeding from China's actual conditions. 
  For instance, since the Copyright Law was put into force in 
1991 local administrative organs responsible for copyright 
affairs investigated and dealt with many cases involving 
pirated books and video products and illegal duplication of 
laser discs. They have confiscated and destroyed the pirated 
goods and levied administrative sanctions on the infringers. 
  A large proportion of the cases concerning violations of 
foreigners' intellectual property rights were investigated and 
dealt with by China's intellectual property protection 
administrative offices on their own initiative, acting in 
accordance with their prescribed functions and powers. 
  The white paper points out in the concluding remarks that 
more than a few international observers have come to the 
conclusion that in terms of intellectual property protection 
China has reached international advanced levels. 
  Nonetheless, China cannot remain satisfied with the 
achievements it has already made. China is a developing country 
and still has much work towards optimizing its intellectual 
property system. This system in its modern form was established 
only a short time ago, and as a result, awareness of 
intellectual property rights remains underdeveloped in society 
at large. 
  In some regions and in some governmental departments there 
is 
insufficient appreciation of the importance of intellectual 
property protection. Some serious acts of infringement have 
violated not only the legitimate rights and interests of the 
holder of the intellectual property right, but also the dignity 
of the law. 
  Accordingly, the State Council has drawn up decisions on 
further strengthening the protection of intellectual property. 
China is confident that the implementation of all the important 
measures contained in the decisions will mark a great new step 
forward in the nation's efforts to ensure the protection of 
intellectual property rights. 
  China will continue actively to promote international 
cooperation in the field of intellectual property and tries to 
make positive contributions towards the development and 
optimization of the international intellectual property system.

  [Text] Beijing, June 15 (XINHUA) -- China's economy is 
expected to grow by about 12 percent in the first half of this 
year, making it easier for the country to achieve the 9-10 
percent growth in 1994, government officials said here today. 
  "This will be much better than expected," said officials 
from 
the State Economic Commission (SEC) in an exclusive interview 
with XINHUA. 
  China's economy has been growing fast and steadily over the 
past months and remains sound thanks to effective price controls 
and further implementation of macro-economic regulation 
measures, the officials said. 
  Latest statistics indicate growth of retail commodity prices 
is falling and industrial production of state-owned enterprises 
going up. China's inflation rate was 18.9 percent in May over 
May last year, with the increase rate down 0.6 percent from the 
previous month. 
  The added value of Chinese industries totalled 619.6 billion 
yuan in the first five months this year, up 16 percent over the 
same period last year. 
  The officials also predicted a bumper harvest of summer 
crops, based on favorable weather condition and farmers' growing 
enthusiasm. 
  Government statistics show that investment by state 
enterprises was 204.4 billion yuan for the first five months 
this year, up 34.2 over the same period last year. The growth 
rate of these investments was down nearly 30 percent, with the 
number of new projects under control, and more money going into 
the key national projects, the SEC officials said. 
  The first five months saw steady growth in government 
income, 
24.3 percent up over the same time last year, with the volume of 
taxes collected up by 22.6 percent. 
  Because of more state bonds issued and more bank savings, 
the 
country's banks withdrew more currency from circulation in the 
first five months. New bank savings in the five months amounted 
to 422.4 billion yuan, and a total of 8.5 billion yuan was 
withdrawn from circulation in May alone, the statistics showed. 
  The country's export growth outpaced the import growth, 
according to governmental figures. In the first five months, 
China's imports were 18.1 percent higher than in the same period 
last year, while exports jumped by 24.1 percent. The trade 
deficit in this period was down to 1.79 billion U.S. dollars. 
  The SEC officials called for continued efforts to rein in 
price rises, implement the macro-economic control measures, and 
maintain the balance of overall supply and demand. 
  They also warned that more attention should be paid to the 
rising gap between sales and industrial production, to promote 
the efficiency of industrial production. The proportion of 
output sold in this period was 92.38 percent of production -- a 
ratio of 1.75 percentage points lower than in the same period 
last year. 
  The SEC believes that with such healthy trends continuing 
and 
the above problems solved, the planned 9-10 percent annual 
growth rate for the national economy is beyond doubt.

"Nationwide General Inspection of Commodity Prices: Results 
Scored, Further Efforts Needed"] 
  [Text] The excessive price increases since last winter and 
spring has caused concern among all social circles. The State 
Council made a timely decision on carrying out a nationwide 
general price inspection and this won the heartfelt support of 
the masses. The people hoped that the general price inspection 
would check the momentum of the price increases and urgently 
demanded that the relevant government departments take serious 
action against the practice of irregularly raising prices and 
charges in order to effectively advance reform, promote 
development, and maintain stability. 
  At present, the six price inspection teams which were sent 
to 
various parts of the country for nearly one month have returned 
to Beijing. This article will inform our readers about the 
major results of the general price inspection, the problems 
discovered by the inspection teams, and their opinions on the 
measures for the next step. 
  The main results: Along with the implementation of 
various control measures and the general price inspection, the 
rapid price raises throughout the whole country have begun to 
abate. 
  At present, the general price inspection has been going on 
in 
all parts of the country. Two-thirds of the 30 provinces, 
autonomous regions, and municipalities have achieved good or 
comparatively good results, which mainly find expression in the 
following: 
  --Enhancing the understanding of the necessity to exercise 
management and control over prices under the conditions of the 
market economy. 
  Since the beginning of this year, the leading comrades of 
the 
party central body and the State Council have repeatedly 
stressed the need to strengthen macrocontrol, curb inflation, 
and maintain social stability. They have also criticized the 
one-sided and laissez-faire approach toward price management. 
This time, with the adoption of various measures for 
regularizing and controlling prices, a propaganda campaign was 
also organized by the propaganda department according to the 
instructions by the State Council leading comrades. Through 
giving publicity to the price control measures and 
organizationally implementing the measures on a large scale, the 
party and the government showed their sincerity and 
determination to the masses in effectively bringing the prices 
under control; this also caused the responsible people of the 
local governments to understand that price control was an 
important function of the government in economic management and 
made producers and dealers aware that one cannot do whatever one 
likes in the market economy. Thus, the general atmosphere for 
exercising price control in the market economy has basically 
taken shape and the laissez-faire condition prevalent since 
prices were decontrolled has been changed. 
  --Promoting the implementation of various measures 
formulated 
by the state for price control and management. It is learned 
that some provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) have 
set up their own grain risk funds: Shanghai's amounted to 400 
million yuan; 350 million yuan in Jiangsu; 250 million yuan in 
Guangdong; 303 million in Shaanxi; 100 million yuan in 
Heilongjiang; and 70 million yuan in Ningxia. At present, 
almost all state-owned and collective retail shops and 
institutions which charge service fees have clearly marked the 
prices of the goods and services they sell. Practices such as 
selling goods and services with clearly marked prices has also 
been adopted by increasing numbers of private enterprises and 
fixed stalls. In some areas with good results, the practice of 
selling goods and services with clearly marked prices accounted 
for 75 percent of all retailers. All provinces (autonomous 
regions and municipalities) have worked out their own measures 
for implementing the regulations laid down by the State Council 
for supervising the prices of daily necessities and basic 
services. Nine provinces and municipalities have announced such 
measures and put them into effect. Some provinces (autonomous 
regions and municipalities) included a number of additional 
categories in the scope of price supervision, such as 
vegetables, medicine, household electric appliances, commodity 
housing, haircutting and hairdressing, and public bathroom 
operations. Heilongjiang Province laid down rules for managing 
the prices of grain, cooking oil, and vegetables. Tianjin 
Municipality required that applications first be filed for 
increasing the prices of some medicines, vinegar, noodles, 
toilet paper, and matches. Guangdong Province's Price Control 
Authority formulated 11 sets of regulations for market prices, 
fees charged by administrative institutions, education fees, 
medical care fees, medicine prices, service fees charged by 
hotels and restaurants, the pricing practice in various trades, 
the antimonopoly and antifraud operations, and for the price 
adjustment fund. At present, the regulations are being 
deliberated on or have been submitted to the upper authorities 
for approval. While decontrolling the vegetable and pork 
wholesale business, Shenzhen City exercises control over the 
differences between the buying and selling prices of the 
retailers; this not only guarantees the reasonable profits of 
those involved in the transactions but also protects the 
interests of both producers and consumers. The Shanghai 
Municipal Price Control Authority formulated and implemented the 
"Interim Regulations on Prohibiting Price Fraud and 
Profiteering" and the "Rules for Awarding Penalties to 
Profiteers in the Entertainment, Catering, Clothing, and 
Mechanical and Electric Appliances Trades." They explicitly 
stipulate that those who raise the prices of the goods and 
services by 50 percent to 150 percent over the normal price 
level fixed by the price control authority will be regarded as 
profiteers and will be punished for their profiteering 
activities. 
  In the month after the rules and regulations 
came into force on a trial basis, definite results were achieved 
in checking profiteering behavior and protecting the interests 
of consumers. In order to stabilize prices, Jilin Province, 
Tianjin Municipality, and Wuhan City decided that no price 
adjustment would be made this year; Dalian City postponed the 
planned adjustment of gas fees, water fees, and school fees. 
Many cities paid attention to the supply of food and 
intensified market construction and management. Practice showed 
that general price inspections create favorable conditions for 
the implementation of the price control measures and the 
implementation of the price control measures provide policy 
foundations for the price inspections and promote the in-depth 
development of the inspections. 
  --Handling a number of lawbreaking cases in the aspect of 
prices. In the general inspection, the various localities mainly 
examined the illegal practice of directly violating the 
regulations on prices, the rates of price difference, and the 
fee standards of goods and services fixed by the state; the 
behavior of some retailers who do not mark the prices clearly; 
and the irregular practice of adding the 17- or 13-percent 
value-added taxes to the commodity prices or raising prices on a 
wide scope and by a big margin. According to statistics in 19 
provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities), between 10 March 
and 15 April, they discovered and handled 61,384 cases of 
violating the price regulations and the total money involved in 
these cases amounted to 53.89 million yuan; 47,397 of these 
cases were handled and the fines imposed on the people and 
institutions involved in these cases amounted to 27.9959 million 
yuan. Of the cases discovered in the general price inspection, 
20,345 were related to the prices of people's daily necessities; 
471 cases were related to the prices of production materials 
being dealt with in a monopolistic way; 672 cases were related 
to the prices of agricultural production materials; 1,139 cases 
were related to the prices of public utilities; and 1,257 cases 
were related to fees charged by administrative institutions. 
Various localities made great efforts to inspect the prices of 
grain, cooking oil, and other consumer goods and basic services 
closely related to the people's livelihood. In Heilongjiang 
Province, the inspection was personally directed by the vice 
governor of the province who took charge plus the participation 
of three deputy secretaries general of the provincial government 
and the leading cadres of the price control authority. 
  They inspected the prices of grain in the links of 
processing, wholesale, and retail and discovered, and solved in 
a timely fashion, the problem of insufficient supply in the main 
channel. They also laid down a price ceiling policy and rapidly 
stabilized the prices of grain and cooking oil in just a number 
of days. Liaoning Province dispatched 756 people to examine the 
grain prices and check a new round of price raises. In 
particular, Shenyang City imposed fines on more than 10 grain 
shops which sold grain at prices higher than those fixed by the 
government and seriously criticized some grain shops which tried 
to hoard goods to making higher profits. These actions checked 
the panic buying phenomena in some areas and stabilized the mass 
psychology. Actions were taken to check the irregular practice 
of raising the prices of salt in Dandong, Liaoning, of medicine 
in Shiyan, Hubei, and of gas in Guangzhou. The price 
inspections effectively checked the tendency toward irregular 
increases of prices and service charges. Various localities in 
particular made public a number of typical and serious cases 
which had produced widespread evil impact and the handling of 
such cases was reported by the mass media. So far, 1,224 cases 
of violating the price control laws and regulations have been 
handled publicly throughout the whole country. This played a 
role in warning and deterring those involved in the illegal 
activities, supporting the grass-roots price inspectors, and 
promoting the development of the general price inspection. 
  --Prompting producers and business dealers to pay attention 
to their internal price management. According to the 
arrangements by the local authorities, many enterprises carried 
out self-examination and self-correction and took the initiative 
in correcting their own behavior in fixing prices. On 12 March, 
Dianmen Food Market in Beijing and 99 other institutions named 
as being the best units in abiding by the state's price and 
measurement regulations and policies, jointly published their 
proposal on maintaining the market stability in RENMIN RIBAO. 
They called on all the state-owned commercial institutions to 
play a leading role in restraining price increases in the 
market, boycotting inferior and counterfeit commodities, and 
effectively guaranteeing the interests of consumers. Shandong 
Province required all commercial enterprises to name their own 
price inspectors and adopt five management systems (the 
bookkeeping system, the decisionmaking system, the system for 
marking clearly prices for goods and services, the system of 
regular price examinations, and the system of market 
investigations), thus perfecting the self-discipline mechanism 
with regard to commodity prices. Wuhan City's Zhongnan 
Commercial Building carried out across-the-board examination of 
clearly marking prices for all the commodities it sold and 
imposed fines on those who bore direct responsibility for not 
marking prices or marking wrong prices. The fines ranged from 
20 to over 1,000 yuan. The People's Market in Shijiazhuang 
City, Hebei Province, began to sell goods popular with customers 
at lower profit rates in April and played a leading role in 
restraining the market prices from increasing. 
  Because of the gradual implementation of the price control 
measures and the general price inspection, the excessive price 
increases throughout the whole country have been restrained. In 
March, the national retail price index rose by a margin of 0.7 
of a percentage point lower than in February; the monthly 
increase rate was 0.7 percent, or 2.4 percentage points lower 
than that in February. 
  The prominent problems: The price situation remains 
serious and prices in some fields remain out of control. Some 
people still do not fully understand the necessity to strengthen 
price management. There remain substantial difficulties and 
obstructions in the handling of cases of violating price 
management regulations. The price control institutions and 
personnel are not sufficiently stable. 
  The state the nationwide general price inspection and the 
situation in the macroeconomic operations showed that the 
present price situation is not a favorable one and the actual 
implementation of various price control measures, and the 
conduct of the general price inspection, still require 
unremitting efforts. At present, the prominent problems in 
price control and inspection are as follows: 
  1. The price situation remains serious. This is 
manifested by the fact that prices are still increasing at a 
high rate; retail prices are still increasing; and, in 
particular, the prices of basic consumer goods and services in 
people's daily lives and the prices of basic production 
materials are increasing at a rate higher than the average. In 
the first quarter of this year, the price indexes of the 15 
categories of commodities (including grain, meat, poultry, eggs, 
aquatic products, and vegetables) all showed increases to 
differing degrees. A noteworthy fact is that, since March, the 
prices of grain and cooking oil in some provinces and autonomous 
regions have risen again. The price indexes in both the urban 
and rural areas rose at the same time. In some rural areas, 
prices rose by a bigger margin than in the urban areas. The 
differences between the rates of increase in the urban and rural 
areas were only 0.1, 1.4, and 0.4 percentage points. [sentence 
and percentages as published] 
  In short, it is still rather difficult to bring the rate of 
price increases within the target scope of the control. The 
main reasons are: First, demand remains too strong and 
continues to pull up the prices and some departments and 
localities are seeking an unrealistically high rate of growth 
and are blindly expanding the size of investment and increasing 
the consumption fund. This caused the excessive issuance of 
currency for the past several consecutive years, caused the 
potential inflation pressure, and brought about a strong 
demand-led pulling force applied to the commodity prices on the 
market. Second, the accumulated costs were released in a larger 
quantity and this also pushed up the prices. In the last few 
years, the prices of many basic products and basic facilities 
were decontrolled and this increased the costs of the downstream 
products. The higher degree of the economy's market orientation 
also raised the prices of land, capital, and labor by larger 
margins and this also directly increased the costs of the 
enterprises' investment, production, and trade. Such 
accumulated costs are being turned into a force to push up the 
commodity prices in the currently brisk market. Third, the 
momentum of spontaneous price increases became stronger. After 
the prices of most commodities were decontrolled there was no 
effective means for controlling and regulating the market 
prices. Since the beginning of this year, some enterprises took 
advantage of the reform of the tax system and the foreign 
exchange system to raise the prices of their products and the 
prices of the goods they sold. This increased the impact of the 
spontaneous price increases. 
  2. Some local government leaders do not fully 
understand the necessity and urgency of controlling price 
increases, do not adopt effective price control measures, and do 
not act according to the requirements of the central 
authorities. This found expression in the following. 
First, they are not fully aware of the seriousness of the 
current situation in which prices are continuing to increase at 
a high rate. Second, they are setting the task of controlling 
the price increases against the task of economic development. 
Third, they think that they might suffer losses if they control 
the prices and might gain benefits if they allow prices to go 
freely. Fourth, they shift the responsibility for price control 
to the central authorities. And fifth, they lack confidence in 
achieving the goal of keeping the rate of price increase within 
10 percent this year. Because there were differences between 
their thinking and the requirements of the central authorities, 
the localities made slow progress in establishing the grain risk 
funds, the food price regulation funds, and the reserves system 
for important materials; failed to adopt effective measures to 
control prices; and they even continued to adopt new plans and 
measures for raising the charges of various public utilities. 
  3. The circulation order was disrupted and prices 
in some fields went out of control. In the course of 
transforming their management and operation mechanisms, some 
state-owned commercial and trade enterprises neglected the 
social effects of their behavior, failing to play the role as 
the main channel in the field of circulation. In particular, 
after the prices of most commodities were decontrolled, and 
because the economic means and the legal means were imperfect to 
a serious degree, prices in some fields went out of control and 
the phenomena of price regulations violations became very 
serious. Some typical actions were as follows: Some grain 
shops sold grain and cooking oil at prices higher than the 
prices fixed by the state. Some enterprises produced chemical 
fertilizer, steel products, and other production materials and 
sold their products at high prices. Some enterprises took 
advantage of the reform of the tax system to include the 
value-added taxes in the prices of the commodities they sold, 
thus raising the commodity prices. Some medical, educational, 
postal and telecommunications, and rural electric power 
institutions charged irregular fees. The price differences in 
the intermediary links of the circulation of some farm products 
and some daily-use industrial goods were too large and, as a 
result, both producers and consumers suffered losses, while 
dealers in the intermediary links earned handsome profits. Some 
private garment shop owners and food stall owners cheated their 
customers by selling their goods at high prices in order to 
profiteer. All these things not only harmed the interests of 
the consumers but also aggravated the unfairness in the field of 
wealth distribution and disrupted the economic order. 
  4. The general price inspection developed unevenly and 
the actions against the cases of violating the price management 
regulations encountered great difficulties and 
obstructions. Some local government leaders did not attach 
importance to the work in this regard. They only relayed the 
instructions of the upper authorities but did not take concrete 
action to implement such instructions and did not include the 
general price inspection in the work schedule of the 
governments. Some local governments did not lay down explicit 
targets and requirements for the price inspection and did not 
make concrete arrangements by the end of March. Some localities 
did not take effective price control measures while carrying out 
the price inspection and did not work out concrete and feasible 
steps for implementing the price control measures laid down by 
the State Council. Some localities did not create a public 
opinion environment to support the general inspection and to 
check the behavior of raising prices and imposing charges 
irregularly. Because of the backwardness of the legislative 
process and the indistinct policies, plus the weakness of the 
inspection means and the lack of mandatory measures, the 
handling of the cases of violating the price management 
regulations encountered great difficulties and obstructions. In 
just over one month after the beginning of the general price 
inspection, there were six cases of attacking and beating up 
price inspectors who were performing their official duties. 
  In addition, some local price management institutions were 
unstable and there was high personnel turnover in those 
institutions. This also weakened the price management and 
affected the effectiveness of the price supervision and 
inspection. 
  The task for the next step is to further implement the 
price control measures on the basis of unifying the thinking, 
lay stress on the key points of inspection, quicken the pace of 
legislation concerning price management, and strive to achieve 
marked results in the field of price management. 
  In March this year, when listening to the report about the 
price situation, General Secretary Jiang Zemin said: Keeping 
prices stable is the key to the proper handling of the 
relationship between reform, development, and stability. In the 
final analysis, it is now necessary to resolutely and 
effectively curb inflation. Premier Li Peng, Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji, and Vice Premier Zou Jiahua also stressed many times 
that curbing inflation and strengthening price control is the 
key task in the economic work at the present stage. Responsible 
people of all localities and departments should enhance their 
consciousness and unify their thinking in line with this 
requirement, overcome various one-sided viewpoints, and maintain 
the same position as the party central leading body. The local 
and departmental interests should give way to the overall 
national interests. In the economic work, importance must be 
attached to curbing inflation and stabilizing market prices. It 
is necessary to suppress the upward tendency of inflation by 
every possible means and strive to keep the increase rate of the 
general retail price index within 10 percent. This was a 
decision made by the party central leading body and the State 
Council and was approved by the National People's Congress. All 
localities must resolutely carry it out and adopt effective 
measures to achieve good results in the field of price 
management. 
  Carrying out the nationwide general price inspection was a 
major measure adopted by the State Council for stabilizing the 
overall situation. The leading comrades of the State Council 
set forth five criteria for judging the effectiveness of the 
general price inspection. We should meet the five criteria in 
the whole process of the general price inspection. In the next 
step of the price inspection, the concrete objectives are as 
follows: 1. To see whether or not the state's price control 
measures have really been implemented, the concrete measures, 
such as those for supervising prices and ensuring that the 
prices are marked clearly, have been properly carried out, and 
whether or not the grain risk funds and the food price 
regulation funds have been set up. 
  2. To see whether or 
not the malpractice of irregular price increases and irregular 
charges in the localities has been effectively checked, the 
action of taking advantage of reforms to raise prices has been 
corrected, and whether or not the cases of violating the price 
management regulations have been properly handled. 3. To see 
whether or not both positive and negative cases have been made 
public and whether or not public opinion has further played a 
role in supervising prices. 4. To see whether or not producers 
and dealers have a stronger sense of abiding by the laws and 
regulations with regard to prices and have adopted more 
effective self-discipline measures. 5. To see whether or not 
the momentum of excessive price increases has abated and the 
rate of price increase has declined somewhat. All localities 
should adopt effective measures in the light of such 
requirements and strive to achieve solid results. 
  It is necessary to organize special inspections on the key 
categories of goods which raised the general price level most 
seriously and on the key items about which the masses complained 
most strongly. In the whole country, it is first necessary to 
guarantee the stability of the prices of grain, cooking oil, and 
other daily necessities. All localities should regularly 
examine the prices of grain and cooking oil and see whether they 
are above the price level fixed by the State Council and the 
local governments at all levels. It is necessary see whether or 
not such management and supervisory measures as submitting the 
plans for adjusting the prices of other basic daily-use goods to 
the authorities concerned for approval and record and 
controlling the price differences (profit margins) in the 
dealings of such goods, are properly carried out, whether or not 
the action of taking advantage of the reform of the tax system 
and the foreign exchange system to raise commodity prices has 
been corrected, and whether or not the grain risk funds and the 
food price adjustment funds have been set up. At the same time, 
in view of the fact that the price of cotton is rising sharply, 
it is necessary to inspect various links in the purchase and 
supply of cotton. Second, it is necessary to inspect the prices 
of chemical fertilizer, diesel oil for farming purposes, 
electricity for farming purposes, steel products, coal, and 
petroleum products and to see whether or not the prices of such 
materials have been raised in violation of the relevant 
regulations. Third, it is necessary to see whether or not the 
basic service charges, including the prices of coal, gas, LP 
gas, rents, water, electricity, local bus services, and local 
public telephone services have been raised in violation of the 
relevant regulations. Various provinces (autonomous regions and 
municipalities) can increase the items of inspection in the 
light of their specific conditions. In the course of inspecting 
the key items, a number of cases of violating the price 
management regulations should be handled publicly. 
  It is necessary to quicken the process of legislation with 
regard to price management, draft the "Price Law" as soon as 
possible, formulate the antimonopoly, antiprofiteering, 
antifraud laws and regulations, regularize various pricing 
behaviors, and begin to draft the "Price Supervision and 
Inspection Regulations." Before the national laws and 
regulations for price management are officially promulgated, 
various localities should be encouraged to formulate their local 
regulations in the light of their specific conditions and their 
successful experience should be summed up and introduced to 
other parts of the country. 
  It is necessary to maintain the stability of the price 
control institutions and their personnel and to make necessary 
manpower and material replenishment to such institutions. The 
means of inspection should be strengthened. Propaganda and 
public opinion should also be further strengthened and public 
opinion should play a more effective role in supervising prices. 
  In order to further advance the general price inspection, it 
is necessary to stress the need to exercise more effective 
leadership, to carry out closer cooperation between different 
departments, and to remove disturbances and obstructions. The 
governments at all levels should attach great importance to the 
general price inspection, include it their work schedules, 
assign principal leaders to personally take up this matter, and 
assign special officials to take charge of the inspection by 
making across-the-board arrangements and ensuring the 
implementation of the concrete steps. Problems arising in the 
work should be resolved in a timely fashion. Various 
departments should conscientiously implement the spirit of the 
relevant documents issued by the State Council and the spirit of 
the telephone conference on the nationwide general price 
inspection. The financial departments should guarantee the 
working funds for dealing with the cases in the price 
inspection; the financial and tax departments should improve the 
scheme for reforming the tax system and join hands with the 
price control department in properly resolving the price 
problems caused by the additional tax burdens for a small number 
of enterprises. The banks should help the price inspection 
organs to execute their decisions by debiting the accounts of 
the institutions and individuals who refuse to pay the fines for 
their violations of the price management regulations. The 
industrial and commercial administrative organs should prompt 
private enterprises, individually-run businesses, and stall 
owners in the fairs to clearly mark the prices of the goods they 
sell and should support the execution of the decisions of the 
price control organs on suspending the business licenses of 
those shops which are found violating the price regulations. 
The technical supervision organs should intensify the 
inspection of the measuring tools and the quality of the goods 
and resolutely punish those who sell inferior goods at high 
prices, give short measure, and raise prices irregularly in 
various forms. The public security organs should take measures 
to protect the personal safety of the price inspectors when they 
are performing their official duties. The supervision department 
should take administrative disciplinary action against officials 
who shield the misconduct of violating the price regulations. 
The grain supply organs should properly handle the purchase, 
transportation, and storage of grain in order to guarantee grain 
supplies in all localities. The commercial department should 
guarantee the supply of the people's daily necessities on the 
markets.

  [Text] Tianjin, June 15 (XINHUA) -- Liu Hongru, 
vice-chairman of the Securities Committee under the State 
Council, said here today that China must create stable growth 
for the futures market through experiment and tightening control 
measures. 
  At a forum on the management and supervision of futures 
markets in the country, Liu said that at present, the conditions 
for China to promote all-round development of the futures market 
are not ripe. 
  More than 40 futures markets have been set up in China over 
the past few years. There are also more than 300 futures 
trading companies approved by local authorities. 
  Liu said that some of the futures markets and futures 
trading 
companies operate in line with the standards of the 
international market and a few futures exchanges have produced 
effects on the formation of the prices in China's production and 
circulation sectors. 
  He said that the development of the futures exchanges has 
also met many problems such as exceeding the allowable number of 
exchanges and nonstandard operation of some futures exchanges. 
  These problems not only impede the positive function of the 
futures market, but also affect the implementation of the 
state's macro control policies and social stability, he said. 
  He pointed out that the development of futures markets 
requires some conditions, involving law and regulations, 
personnel, business experiences and people's concepts of risk 
factors. 
  The market environment and market mechanism for futures 
exchanges also call for improvement. 
  Liu said that the State has to enhance the management and 
supervision of futures markets. 
  The State Council recently approved the Securities 
Committee's circular on stopping the tendency of blind 
development of futures markets, which demanded that local 
governments rectify futures markets and exchanges. 
  The circular stressed implementing special measures over the 
futures abroad and dealing with illegal futures trading. 
  The circular said that local governments and all central 
departments should cease to approve setting up new futures 
exchanges. 
  No agencies are permitted to engage in futures trading of 
renminbi (Chinese currency) and foreign currencies. 
  Liu noted that the state enterprises and institutions taking 
part in futures exchange must be under strict control. 
  The officials of provincial securities management 
departments 
and specialists attended the forum.

  [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- China has issued a set 
of industrial policies to guide the development of key economic 
sectors in the last few years of the 20th century, a senior 
government official announced here today. 
  Under the policies, China will, through industrial 
restructuring, pinpoint the development of agriculture, 
infrastructure and basic industries, electronics and machinery, 
petroleum and petro-chemicals, trade, as well as the auto and 
building industries, said Ye Qing, vice-minister of the State 
Planning Commission, at a press conference. 
  Ye said that the "framework of national industrial policy in 
the 1990s (FNIP)", worked out by the State Council, China's 
highest governing body, laid down important policies on the 
direction and targets of the country's structural adjustment in 
the 1990s. 
  He said China encourages direct foreign investment in 
infrastructure and basic industries. Investors in the transport 
sector are expected to be given first priority in developing 
real estate along the facilities they build. 
  To promote trigger industries, China will increase input 
into 
technological advancement in electronics and machinery, oil and 
petro-chemicals, automobile and building industries. Those 
sectors will also enjoy priority in issuing bonds and shares, Ye 
said. 
  China will also readjust import tariffs in accordance with 
the industrial policies to boost foreign trade, he said. 
  Under the just-issued policies, the vice-minister said, 
China 
will also rationalize the industrial organization, promote 
technological upgrading, adjust economic location, continue to 
develop service sectors, and accelerate the growth of hi-tech 
industries. 
  According to Ye, the State Council will, in the near future, 
spell out specific policies for such infrastucture and key 
industries as transport, telecommunications, construction, 
electronics and machinery, petro-chemical industry, foreign 
trade, foreign investment and technology, so as to speed up 
development of those sectors.

  [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- China's new automobile 
industry policy has been approved and put into operation by the 
State Council, according to Ye Qing, vice-minister of the State 
Planning Commission. 
  At a press conference held today by the Information Office 
of 
the State Council, Ye said that the new automobile industry 
policy especially encourages enterprise annexation and auto 
parts production. 
  He said that after 40 years' development, China's auto 
industry had made great achievements. 
  But with the progress of China's drive to reform and open to 
the world, and the country's fast economic development, the auto 
industry had been increasingly suffering from a number of 
defects, he said, adding that the main ones include the 
decentralized layout of factories, small scale of production, 
low technological level, and repeated imports of foreign 
technology. 
  He said that in the coming few years China will restructure 
the layout of the auto industry, try to establish a number of 
trans-provincial auto centers with reasonable output capability, 
through market competition. By the year 2000, some three 
auto-making giants will be set up, he disclosed. 
  To raise the overall level of China's auto industry, he 
said, 
China will pay great attention to the production of auto parts, 
especially key parts for cars. 
  Foreign businessmen are welcome to cooperate with China in 
this field, and preferential policies will be provided for auto 
parts producers. 
  Sources from the Ministry of Machinery Industry said that 
China has already selected more than 20 key parts for cars to 
enjoy the government's special support, including preferential 
policies and policy-oriented loans. 
  China also encourages auto parts enterprises to introduce 
foreign technology and funds, in a bid to promote their product 
level and development capability. 
  The auto industry is one of China's industries with the 
fastest development speed. In the past few years it maintained 
an annual average increase of over 20 percent. Last year China 
produced a total of 1.34 million automobiles, and this year's 
output is predicted to exceed the figure.

<F P=106> [By Tiffany Brown] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, June 16 (AFP)--China underlined Thursday 
its commitment to protecting its fledgling car industry from 
foreign competition, issuing a policy paper blocking overseas 
investment in assembly plants until 1996. 
  "Under the industrial policy, until the end of 1995, no 
projects domestic or foreign involving the making of whole cars 
will be approved," while restrictions on imports will continue, 
the vice minister of the State Planning Commission, Ye Qing, 
told reporters. 
  Foreign companies will instead be encouraged to invest in 
factories producing components and spare parts to promote the 
backward sector's technological upgrading, Ye quoted the 
Industrial Policy for the Automobile Industry, issued by the 
State Council, as stipulating. 
  "We welcome extensive cooperation with foreign partners in 
the sphere of component parts," the official said, revealing 
that any companies involved in successful projects in this 
sphere would be given priority when China freed up restrictions 
on assembly plants after 1996. 
  The extent of such liberalisation would depend on China's 
economic development and the market demand for family cars at 
that time, he said, defending the moves by saying the domestic 
industry remained in its "infant stage" despite 30 years of 
development. 
  The new policy also outlines moves to rationalise and 
upgrade 
technological levels in the sector, while encouraging 
localisation of component purchasing by offering preferential 
treatment to factories buying more than 60 percent of their 
parts domestically within three years, Ye said. 
  Rationalisation is to focus on restructuring the country's 
120 scattered, small-scale car plants into bigger groups 
producing better quality vehicles, of which most are to be 
family cars, he said. 
  The country's 1.18 billion people now own only 8.3 million 
cars, with family vehicles accounting for only small proportion 
of China's auto output of 1.18 million units last year. 
  "By 1996, we will satisfy 90 percent of the domestic market 
demand and over half of auto output will be cars," he said. 
  By 2000, basic restructuring of plants into "three big and 
three small" conglomerates would be complete, with the three 
major groups "accounting for the majority of sales on China's 
domestic market," he said. 
  Ye said the three groups -- which reports say are to produce 
five million cars by 2000 -- would be centred around plants in 
northeastern Changchun, Shanghai and central Wuhan that have 
joint ventures with Germany's Volkswagen-Audi, Volkswagen and 
France's Citroen respectively. 
  Although he did not explain how the restructuring would 
affect other existing foreign-funded car assembly projects in 
China, foreign carmakers here played down the implications of 
the policy paper. 
  Most major international players are already manufacturing 
cars here, they said, adding they were now stepping up 
involvement in projects making components and establishing links 
with key members of the "big three" to ensure their position in 
China after 1996. 
  Of greater concern to foreign manufacturers are the 
continuing restrictions on imports. Foreign cars now face 
import tariffs of 150 percent. 
  The Industrial Policy for the Automobile Industry was the 
first of a series of specific policy statement due to be issued 
under the Framework of National Industrial Policy for the 1990s, 
also released by the State Council recently. 
  Other policy papers are to include such sectors as 
transportation, telecommunications, construction, electronics 
and machinery, petrochemical, foreign trade, foreign investment 
and technology, Ye said.

  [Text] Beijing, 16 Jun (XINHUA) -- The general office of 
the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters today 
issued this year's flood bulletin No. 1. The bulletin said: 
Since the arrival of flood season south of the lower reaches of 
the Chang Jiang, the Min Jiang in Fujian and the Xi Jiang in 
Guangxi were hit by relatively bigger floods; torrential rains 
and flooding occurred in parts of such provinces as Jiangxi, 
Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Hunan; and major rock-falling 
disasters occurred in Wulong County, Sichuan, resulting in 
rather serious economic losses. Water situations in other 
rivers, streams, and lakes are basically stable. 
  The bulletin said: A stable rain belt which was formed by 
the mutual effect of warm and cold air, and which has persisted 
since 12 June from the northern part of southern China to the 
southern part of areas situated to the south of the lower 
reaches of the Chang Jiang, has successively caused flooding in 
the Xi Jiang in Guangxi and the Bei Jiang in Guangdong. At 1400 
and 2100 [0600 and 1300 GMT] on 15 June, flood waters moving at 
10,100 cubic meters [m] per second and 10,050 cubic m per second 
successively hit the Rong Jiang and the Long Jiang, tributaries 
of the Xi Jiang. After these two streams of flood waters 
converged and entered the Liu Jiang, a flood crest was observed 
at the Liuzhou Station along the Liu Jiang at 0600 today. The 
crest, with a water level reaching 88.53 m and a flow capacity 
of 25,000 cubic m per second, was the third biggest flood water 
recorded since the founding of the PRC. Our preliminary 
understanding is that Liuzhou City and Prefecture were partly 
flooded, with flood water levels generally reaching 2-3 m, and 
two people were reported dead at the time this news dispatch was 
sent. At 1000 today, water level measured at the Liuzhou 
Station along the Liu Jiang had dropped to 88.45 m. However, 
moderate to torrential rainfall would persist in the Xi Jiang 
reaches, with heavy rains falling in part of those areas. It is 
estimated that the flooding would possibly continue for some 
time. 
  Following the natural disaster, the Guangxi Zhuang 
Autonomous 
Regional party committee and people's government immediately 
convened an emergency meeting to arrange flood fighting and 
emergency measures. The general office of the State Flood 
Control and Drought Relief Headquarters also sent specially 
designated personnel to Guangxi to aid in flood fighting and 
relief work. 
  Since early June, scarce rainfall has continued to cause 
drought in most of northern China, the western regions of 
northeast China, and the provinces and autonomous regions of 
Shandong, Ningxia, and Qinghai. Statistics compiled by the end 
of 14 June showed that an area totaling 12.87 million hectares 
in the nation was hit by drought. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous 
Region, Hebei Province, and Shandong Province each had over 2 
million hectares of areas hit by drought.

<F P=106> [By Cary Huang and Amy Liu] </F>
  [Excerpt] China decided to grant a tax holiday for 
state-run firms involved in grain wholesales in a move to curb 
inflation fuelled by price rises on staple foods in recent 
months. 
  The tax exemption which was begun early this month would 
last 
until the end of next year, according to an internal circular 
issued by the State Council, China's cabinet. 
  The circular said state-run wholesalers responsible for 
sales 
of grain and edible oil to urban residents, military units and 
farmers would be exempted from various taxes including corporate 
tax and value-added tax during the holiday. 
  State-run wholesalers for fodder are also granted the 
preferential treatment, Chinese sources quoted the document as 
saying. 
  The move was the latest effort by the government to combat 
inflation which has risen above 20 percent in major Chinese 
cities in the past few months. 
  The spriralling prices have become a matter of great concern 
to the leadership, which is worried that they may prompt social 
unrest. 
  Inflation and rampant corruption were said to be major 
factors behind the student-led protests in 1989 which ended with 
the bloody military crackdown in Tiananmen Square. 
  Meanwhile, sources said the government's pledge of intensive 
action to boost agriculture was in vain since local governments 
and most central ministries were reluctant to implement the 
policies. 
  Despite food production goals laid out by the State Council 
earlier this year, no concrete measures were actually in place, 
a Chinese economic source said yesterday. 
  Beijing's plans involve pumping an additional 1.9 billion 
yuan (HK$1.69 billion) into the agricultural sector--but only a 
trickle of the amount has been placed. 
  Beijing also planned to import great quantities of chemical 
fertiliser and pesticides this year, but just a small portion of 
the quota had been fulfilled so far, sources said. [passage

Commission: "Intensify Efforts To Build Cash Crop Production 
Bases"] 
  [Text] Achievements of Last Decade 
  From 1983 onward, the central and local authorities began to 
choose counties with favorable natural conditions and greater 
grain output potential from among the 11 provinces (regions) of 
Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Jilin, 
Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, and Guangdong to launch 
a pilot program of establishing cash crop bases there. They 
found 60 such counties, made joint investment in the pilot 
programs, and scored outstanding results. By 1992, the state 
had invested and built 362 cash crop bases, 144 quality-cotton 
production county bases (farms), five sugar production county 
bases, and 261 good oil-bearing crop, fruit, vegetable, tea, and 
flower production bases; and 529 famous, special, and superior 
farm products, plus hundreds of livestock-related and aquatic 
products had also been developed. Beginning in 1993, they made 
arrangements to establish another 117 cash crop production 
bases, 33 quality-cotton production county bases, and 12 sugar 
production bases. 
  The development of cash crop production bases is a key 
measure in raising comprehensive agricultural production 
capacity more quickly. 
  First, it has improved agricultural production conditions, 
strengthened the technological base for agriculture, improved 
the quality of agricultural products, and saved and retrieved a 
large number of rare and valuable agricultural items. Cash crop 
production bases have vigorously promoted good crop strains and 
advanced and practical cultivation techniques. Now, both grains 
and cotton are improving in quality and cultivation areas for 
good strains of rice, wheat, rape, and tea have increased. 
  Second, they have increased market varieties and raised 
agricultural returns. Cash crop production bases, especially 
those specialized in famous, special, or superior farm products, 
concentrated on products in high domestic demand and competitive 
on international markets and gave them priority. Many of these 
products have filled the gaps in domestic markets. Superior 
farm products required by many of the country's high-standard 
guesthouses and hotels, such as lemons, Chinese plums, cherries, 
longan, and leechee, are now being supplied by cash crop 
production bases. The development of a group of modern farm 
product processing enterprises has greatly boosted the storage, 
transport, and packing capacity of farm products, reduced their 
perishability, and raised the post-production processing 
standards. 
<H5>  Some Basic Experiences </H5>
  We have gained a great deal of experience in the decade-long 
development of cash crop production base, which can be summed up 
as follows: 
  1. To overcome the problem of diffused investment, counties 
have become the investment bases, while projects are jointly 
financed by the central and local governments and peasants. 
Cash crop base investment ratio between the central and local 
governments in the Sixth Five-Year Plan was 1:1 but in practice 
it came to 1:1.36. The Seventh Five-Year Plan maintained 
central-local joint investment and, furthermore, opened 
financing to a variety of channels and methods, further 
stimulating enthusiasm for building cash crop bases. During the 
Seventh Five-Year Plan, the local authorities invested 150 
million yuan in developing famous, special, and superior farm 
products versus the 68 million yuan injected by central 
government, more than twice the central amount. 
  2. Central planning and a full role for regional advantages. 
Cash crop production bases in our country have assumed a basic 
pattern which will greatly help the progress toward 
specialization and regionalization. There are about 500 large 
counties across the country currently producing over 75 million 
kg of commercial grain, with another 479 counties under 
construction; and 300 counties boasting 100,000 mu of 
cotton-producing areas and producing over 100,000 dan of cotton, 
with a further 177 under construction which will also be 
producing famous, special, and superior farm products. 
  3. The construction combined long-term and short-term plans, 
highlighted key areas, and focused on infrastructure projects 
which had a direct bearing on agricultural production. A lot of 
effort went into tackling agricultural infrastructure 
construction, especially supporting project packages in pre- and 
post-production stages and during the production. All these 
will increase the reserve strength for developing agriculture 
and they will have a long-term effect. 
  4. The integration of production, supply, and sales, and the 
introduction of comprehensive services at the pre- and post- 
production, as well as the production, stages. The following 
were the major forms: One, offering information and technical 
services centered on production and construction and making 
direct production-sales links; two, instituting economic 
corporate bodies and easing products from production bases into 
the circulation realm; three, developing these bases into 
institutions with business organizations with the goal of moving 
toward the integration of trade, industry, and agriculture; and 
four, building a nationwide federation for developing farm 
products to facilitate transfers of bulk farm products over wide 
areas. Facts show that the integration of production and sales 
can open up channels for both sectors and encourages bases to 
plan commodity production according to market demand. 
  New Construction Goals 
  As a strategic move in developing high-yield, superior, and 
high-efficiency agriculture, cash crop production bases must be 
continued with for a long time. In the future, these bases must 
strive to achieve the following targets: 
  Make obvious improvements in agricultural production. First, 
raise the comprehensive agricultural production capacity and 
comprehensive services; second, achieve sustained and stable 
growth in agricultural production and win for the production 
base a key role in the development of national agricultural 
production; third, raise the quality and the percentage of 
commercial farm products, stabilize domestic market supply, 
gradually expand international markets, and increase exports to 
earn more foreign exchange; and four, through the construction 
of production bases, develop production and raise economic 
returns to increase peasants' income and promote the economies 
of county bases. 
  Further consolidate and perfect commercial grain and cotton 
bases. These are generally troubled by high output, low 
efficiency, low earnings for peasants, financial difficulties, 
and slow economic development. The state has decided to start 
arranging special loans in 1994 for large cash crop and quality 
commercial cotton county bases and concentrate efforts on 
supporting them by suitably increasing investment in their 
construction. 
  Expand the scale of developing famous, special, and superior 
farm products. It is necessary to increase efforts to promote 
new products recently marketed by localities, import and absorb 
a wide range of good foreign strains and advanced technology, 
and develop, using selective focuses, a number of new 
internationally competitive products. Regarding improvement, we 
must extend our efforts into the processing, packaging, storage 
areas and raise the standard of post-production treatment of 
commodities to increase their additional value. In terms of 
ways of improvement, we must integrate production with 
distribution services, expand the construction of 
post-production facilities, and actively develop new production 
systems such as those integrating production, supply, and sales; 
or trade, industry, and agriculture; or growing, breeding, and 
processing. In terms of the scale of development, we must 
pursue serialized set-quantity production, develop competitive 
products, encourage horizontal integration between production 
bases and development groups. 
  Perfect the management of cash crop production bases. The 
management structure must be headed by a general coordination 
department, which centralizes bases' construction funds and 
channels social funds toward such construction projects. We 
must build and perfect management organs to oversee the 
construction of production bases.

  [Text] Changchun, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Northeastern China's 
Changbai Mountains Nature Reserve, unique in its forest 
ecosystem and biological variation, is attracting increasing 
numbers of world ecologists. 
  It is becoming a sought-after place for international 
cooperation in research on forest ecosystems. 
  Set up in 1960, this nature reserve covers more than 190,000 
ha. It joined the network of international biosphere protection 
areas in 1980. 
  Specialists point out that the same kind of forests had once 
existed in North America and Europe, but they have vanished 
because of human felling or through glacier movements. That 
leaves Changbai as an important genes store for temperate zone 
animal species and plant varieties. 
  It has been calculated that there are 2,500 kinds of plants, 
500 kinds of vertebrates and nearly a thousand kinds of 
invertebrates in the area. 
  The Chinese Academy of Sciences has set up Changbai 
Mountains 
Research Station of Forest Ecosystems there. 
  According to a deputy director of the station, with China's 
wider opening to the world, ecological research has also ended 
its seclusion. 
  Since the research station first invited two ecology 
advisers 
from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO) to inspect the station in 1979, more than 
100 overseas experts have been there to cooperate with Chinese 
research staff in their studies. 
  It has finished a cooperative research program with Germany, 
and another program with Britain, studying the application of 
forest nitrogen, is going on. 
  It is also involved in joint studies of volcanic history 
with 
the Swiss Academy of Science, and the research of volcanic 
activity and changes of vegetation with Japan. 
  The participation of noted world experts and scholars has 
helped the research there to move further and faster.

  [Text] From 7 to 11 June, led by Governor Chen Mingyi, 
leaders in charge of various provincial departments concerned 
inspected Pinghe, Xiapu, Fuan, Zhouning, and other cities and 
counties in eastern Fujian where they went deep into some key 
villages, poverty-stricken villages, and poor households in the 
old liberated areas; visited the sites of the former Eastern 
Fujian CPC Special Committee and Eastern Fujian Soviet 
Government; and inspected a batch of key projects, including 
prosperity-securing projects, urban renovation projects, new 
development zones, comprehensive rural development zones, 
enterprises, and schools. 
  Wherever they went, the provincial leaders held wide-ranging 
and in-depth talks with the local cadres and people. Governor 
Chen Mingyi stated: The eastern Fujian economy has always been 
a crucial component of the Fujian economy. Eastern Fujian still 
has enormous economic potential and is bound to benefit the 
Fujian economy as a whole. 
  The governor fully affirmed the achievements scored by 
eastern Fujian in various fields of endeavor, and urged comrades 
in eastern Fujian to make redoubled efforts to build a socialist 
market economy structure and to strive to strengthen each and 
every weak link in production and economic operation.

<F P=106> [By unidentified staff commentator: "Learn Suzhou's </F>
Experience"] 
  [Text] Suzhou has gained a lot of good experiences in 
building material and spiritual civilizations. A report in this 
newspaper today on Suzhou's good public security is one of those 
experiences -- one that is worth pondering by purposeful people. 
  Public security is a widely discussed issue -- an issue that 
the masses are concerned about and the party and government have 
attached importance to. Many localities have taken 
comprehensive measures to manage public security and have 
achieved noticeable results. But, situations in other 
localities have not been very good -- leaders in these 
localities still lack a sense of urgency, have not addressed 
themselves to improving local public security, have not been 
persistent in doing the work, or have not considered the work to 
be important. Two kinds of one-sidedness in perceiving the 
issue are at work: 
  "Poor public security is due to a backward economy. Public 
security will automatically improve once the economy is 
developed." People with this kind of thinking do not do things 
with both hands -- they use one hand while the other is idle. 
  "Reform and opening up has invited an invasion by foreign 
cultures and many people have led a decayed life-style, 
therefore, social ills are inevitable. The profit-oriented 
market economic system has aroused people's greed, so committing 
offenses is beyond prevention." The conclusion from this theory 
is that nothing can be done about the problem. Hence, these 
people can never be taught to use the other hand. 
  The Suzhou experience has emerged at the right time. Based 
on the facts, it is convincing criticism against the two 
aforementioned erroneous views. Maybe a backward economy truly 
has adverse effects on improving public security, but the theory 
that once the economy is developed public security will 
automatically improve is completely absurd. Good public 
security requires good management. Without good management, how 
can one expect good public security? Poor public security means 
a poor investment climate. With a poor investment climate, how 
can we expect the economy to develop in a sustained, rapid, and 
healthy manner? If Suzhou followed this line, it would not be 
the "paradise" that it is today. It would have been a paradise 
for lawless elements. 
  The second view is half correct, but the conclusion is 
completely wrong. I say it is half correct because it does 
touch on the new developments and problems in current public 
security work, which are much more complicated and difficult 
than before. But, as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said as early as 
five years ago: "Reform and opening up will inevitably bring in 
some bad influences from the West -- we have never 
underestimated this." It is just for this reason that we need 
to particularly emphasize the need to grip tightly with two 
hands -- not any other way. 
  Of course, we need a correct way to be tough -- that is, we 
need to take measures aimed at specific problems, think of new 
ways to deal with problems, set new standards, and develop new 
mechanisms. Suzhou has gained experience in these matters, which 
is worth studying by other localities. As long as leaders at 
all levels have a good understanding of their political 
responsibility, straighten out their ideological thinking, and 
enlist the help of the broad masses, they will be completely 
able to ensure good public security and maintain social peace by 
taking comprehensive management measures.

<F P=106> ["Dispatch" by staff reporters Chen Chien-ping (7115 1696 </F>
1627) and Fang Hsiao-yi (2075 2556 1837): "In an Exclusive 
Interview With Our Reporters, Governor Zhao Zhihao Says Shandong 
Implements an Outward-Driven Strategy and Will Focus on Using 
Foreign Capital To Build Steel Plants This Year"] 
  [Text] Shandong, 12 Jun -- In an interview here with our 
reporters on 8 June, Shandong Governor Zhao Zhihao said that 
Shandong is comprehensively implementing an outward-driven 
strategy. It has adopted all positive methods and measures to 
promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of 
Shandong's national economy on the basis of fulfilling the 
quadruplication task ahead of schedule and raise it to a new 
level. These measures include inviting banking investments, 
transferring stocks, exchanging markets for technology, and 
expediting construction of two projects which will straddle the 
next century, i.e. the development of the Huang He Delta and the 
construction of offshore Shandong. 
  In the course of the interview, Governor Zhao said: Shandong 
Province has earnestly implemented a series of principles and 
policies by the party Central Committee and the State Council 
and, in light of the province's reality, carried out its work in 
a creative way. It fulfilled the task of quadrupling its 
national economy ahead of schedule in 1993 and thus laid a good 
foundation for its development this year. 
  Zhao said: In light of the international and domestic 
situations and environments, as well as the reality in Shandong, 
the provincial party committee and the provincial government 
have put forward an outward-driven strategy under which Shandong 
will boost its economic growth by developing its export-oriented 
economy and improving the quality of its economy as a whole. 
The utilization of foreign capital will be grasped as a key to 
boosting economic growth and numerous flexible methods will be 
adopted to extensively invite foreign investments, especially 
banking investments. Great efforts will be made to increase the 
number of newly approved foreign-funded enterprises to over 
10,000 and raise the foreign capital actually used to over $3.5 
billion this year, an increase of over 50 percent. Governor Zhao 
disclosed: With regard to key development projects this year, 
the province has defined the direction of using foreign capital 
to build large iron and steel plants, power plants, and 
automobile industrial projects. The focus of foreign capital 
introduced into Shandong this year will be placed on 
infrastructure, basic industries, and the technological 
transformation of enterprises, as well as on capital and 
technology intensive industries. To this end, Shandong has 
selected a number of large and medium enterprises for "grafting" 
and transformation through the use of foreign capital. Governor 
Zhao said: Shandong should reach a new level in its exports 
this year. Beside bringing into play the role of foreign trade 
companies at all levels as a main force, we should take 
foreign-invested enterprises as a focus for expanding exports 
and strive to increase the province's foreign exchange earnings 
by 20 percent. Meanwhile, we should steadily develop Shandong's 
overseas enterprises and gradually improve such networks as the 
sales promotion of Shandong products abroad, fundraising, 
technological cooperation, and information. 
  According to statistics, Shandong's overall economy has 
constantly developed in a good direction this year. There are 
three principal characteristics: The introduction of reform 
measures has been smooth and the transition from an old to a new 
structure has been stable; the national economy has developed in 
a sustained way, with the major indexes satisfactory; and social 
problems have been satisfactorily resolved. The masses are in a 
good mood and the society is stable. Governor Zhao said: In 
the first quarter of this year, Shandong's national economy 
maintained its fine development momentum, with a GDP of 66 
billion yuan, an increase of 18.3 percent over the same period 
last year. The situation in agricultural production was fairly 
good, with total summer grain output expected to top 40 billion 
jin, the highest level ever. The growth in industrial production 
has tended to stabilize. In the first four months of this year, 
industrial output value at the township level or above rose by 
27.9 percent and the production-marketing ratio was 92.1 
percent, an increase of 2 percentage points over the same period 
last year. The scale of investment in fixed assets was 
initially kept under control and the export-oriented economy 
developed steadily. Foreign exchange earnings rose by 16.1 
percent and the actual use of foreign capital by 25 percent. 
Financial revenue and expenditure rose steeply, with revenue 
growing by 21.8 percent and expenditure by 20.9 percent. The 
banking situation was fine, with deposits in financial 
institutions rising by 17.46 billion yuan compared with the 
figure at the beginning of this year and loans increasing by 
6.26 billion yuan. Commodity sales were relatively stable, with 
the total volume of retail sales growing by 28.3 percent. 
  Since reform and opening up over a dozen years or so ago 
Shandong, characterized by its rapid, stable, and overall 
development, has gradually developed into a big economic 
province on China's eastern coast. After reviewing the 
earth-shaking changes which had taken place in impoverished 
Shandong, which in the past was noted for its people "braving 
the journey to the northeast to eke out an existence," Governor 
Zhao said with feeling: We owe all this to the guidance of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, to the party's basic line of "one 
center, two basic points," to the correct leadership of the 
central authorities, and to the hard struggle of the people of 
the whole province. He said: Shandong's strategic goal in 
economic and social development for some time to come will be 
divided into three steps: The first step is the goal of 
quadrupling the 1988 GDP ahead of schedule, which was 
accomplished in 1993; the second is to octuple the GDP by the 
end of this century; and the third is to attain the level of an 
intermediate developed country in Asia in 2010 in terms of 
economic aggregate and basically achieve modernization. 
  Governor Zhao said: To achieve this goal, while improving 
the quality of economic development, we should strive from now 
till the year 2000, to attain a higher economic growth rate than 
the nation's average, with the GDP growing by an annual average 
of 10 to 12 percent, the total agricultural output value by 5 to 
6 percent, the total industrial output value by over 15 percent, 
the added value of tertiary industry by 16 percent, the foreign 
exchange earned from exports by 16 percent, and a natural 
population growth rate of less than 8 per mill. Proceeding from 
the actual conditions in Shandong, we should focus on doing a 
good job of the "3321 project" (reinforcing the three 
foundations: Agriculture, basic industries, and infrastructure; 
fighting well the "three major campaigns"; invigorating Shandong 
through application of scientific and technological advances, 
developing the export-oriented economy, and developing tertiary 
industry; and doing a good job in the two major projects 
extending beyond this century: the "offshore Shandong" 
construction and the development of Huang He Delta), and 
cultivate a number of leading industries and superior products 
so that Shandong's economy can scale a new height.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 15 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai is to pool 
more overseas investment for infrastructures, hi-tech and 
industrial projects, and the tertiary industry. 
  Wang Zukang, official in charge of the city's economic 
relations and trade, said that the metropolis welcomes all 
overseas investors, no matter what size of investment. 
  Now, the second batch of ten capital construction projects 
are inviting biddings, such as an international airport and a 
railway in the Pudong New Area, a deep-water container port and 
a sewage disposal project. 
  The city has encouraged cooperation among large state-owned 
enterprises and big international conglomerates, expecting to 
launch a group of joint projects featuring high technology and 
products with high quality and good market outlook. 
  The city's tertiary industry has also seen fast development. 
  The country's "Wall Street" on the west bank of the Huangpu 
River is taking shape. Commercial housing and renovation of the 
old downtown have progressed smoothly. 
  So far, the city has approved 8,551 foreign-funded projects, 
with promised investment of 17.57 billion U.S. dollars. 
  In January-May this year, 1,612 such items were approved, 
with a contractual investment of 3.85 billion U.S. dollars.

<F P=106> [By reporters Wang Wei (3769 0251) and Fu Xianwei (0265 6343 </F>
0251)] 
  [Text] At a meeting held yesterday to introduce Pudong's 
policy, Zhao Qizheng, vice mayor of Shanghai and chairman of the 
New Pudong District Management Committee, reiterated: Despite 
the fact that the state has carried out taxation reform, the 
preferential taxation policy enjoyed by enterprises of various 
ownerships in the New Pudong District remains unchanged in order 
to maintain continuity of the Pudong development policy. 
Investors from China and foreign countries can invest in Pudong 
without reservations. 
  In response to questions on Pudong's taxation policy raised 
by some people from home and abroad, a responsible person of the 
taxation bureau of the New Pudong District explained yesterday: 
After the taxation reform was carried out, the New Pudong 
District made a clear-cut decision to continue implementing 
various regulations on preferential taxation policy in the New 
Pudong District. These regulations on preferential taxation 
policy include a series of preferential taxation policies 
intended for foreign-funded enterprises, domestic-funded 
enterprises, and enterprises in the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone. 
According to the principle of the separated taxes system, 
implementation rules for relevant preferential taxation policies 
were formulated for foreign-invested enterprises, retailing and 
catering service enterprises in the main commercial area of 
Pudong's market town, enterprises meant for placing people whose 
land was taken by the government for other uses, private 
enterprises, and enterprises participating in the production 
material market of the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone. 
  People pay special attention to the preferential policy 
intended for enterprises of the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone. Vice 
Mayor Zhao Qizheng, who just came back from the national bonded 
zone work forum held in Tianjin recently, brought home the 
latest news: We should manage bonded zones according to 
international norms. We should regard bonded zones as the 
linking points between or the integration of international and 
domestic markets and guide bonded zones enterprises toward the 
large international market. Zhao Qizheng pointed out: Based on 
the national bonded zone work forum guidelines, the Waigaoqiao 
Bonded Zone will soon make its new regulations public to help 
the bonded zone play a more effective role. 
  These reporters learned: From January to May this year, 
Pudong approved 449 new foreign-invested projects, up 7.2 
percent over the same period of last year. The contracted 
foreign capital totaled $1.933 billion, up 61.1 percent over the 
same period of last year. Of these, $1.462 billion were directly 
invested in by foreign investors, up 93.4 percent over the same 
period of last year. This fully shows that Pudong remains 
popular among foreign investors.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 15 (XINHUA) -- According to a WEN 
HUI BAO report, over the last few years, party committees and 
governments at all levels in Shanghai have effectively 
strengthened comprehensive management of public security -- all 
relevant departments, circles, and units have joined forces in 
improving public security and motivated the masses to take part 
in the work. Currently, a mass public security defense and 
management network has covered Shanghai's urban and rural areas. 
  Some 400,000 people in Shanghai annually take part in mass 
efforts to improve public security; 586 residents committees 
(villages) have been named "small safe districts" by district, 
county, or neighborhood (township, town) authorities; and not a 
single criminal case took place in 1,491 residents committees 
(villages) last year.

<F P=106> [Station commentary: "Firmly Combat Drought To Ensure Summer </F>
Sowing and Harvest, Then Strive for Autumn Bumper Harvest"] 
  [Text] The province has basically completed its summer 
harvest, and the total wheat output is estimated at 20 billion 
kg, another record high. However, ravages of drought are 
developing quickly in the province at present, which will bring 
about tremendous difficulties for summer sowing and autumn 
seedling management in various localities. According to the 
present estimates conducted in various localities on 14 June, 
some 70 million mu of fields were afflicted with drought, and of 
this, 30 million mu were severely afflicted. Due to the 
drought, dead seedlings resulted in 850,000 mu of corn and 
peasant fields sown in spring and summer. Seedlings were unable 
to emerge normally on 1.5 million mu of summer-sown cropfields. 
And nearly 20 million mu of summer-sowing cropfields were 
unable to be sown on time due to the drought. 
  A department concerned, maintains that if there are no heavy 
rains in the near future, the province will be threatened by the 
difficulties in sowing seedlings, ensuring sound growth of 
seedlings, and providing drinking water for people and animals. 
According to the weather forecast by the provincial 
meteorological department, far from promising obvious rainfalls 
in the near future, the province will experience high 
temperatures in succession. At the moment, the situation of 
combating drought to ensure summer sowing and summer harvest is 
extremely grim. Therefore, all localities should cool off from 
the joy of bumper harvest and should rapidly set off a mighty 
movement of combating drought to ensure summer sowing and summer 
harvesting throughout the province. As demanded by the 
emergency notice of the provincial government, all localities 
should lose no time and concentrate energies on sowing and 
managing summer crops. By overcoming the fear of difficulty, 
the mood of worry, and the idea of waiting for rains at the 
mercy of the elements, all localities should make full use of 
all water sources and water areas to combat drought with a view 
to ensuring sowing and sound growth of seedlings. Meanwhile, 
attention should be paid to resolving problems in providing 
drinking water for people and animals. The areas now harvesting 
wheat should make appropriate arrangements for simultaneously 
harvesting, sowing, and managing crops and for ensuring both 
wheat harvest and drought combat with a view to winning the last 
victory in summer sowing and harvest through drought combat and 
to reaping an even greater bumper harvest in autumn crops.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 15 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai City will 
hold a fair for promotion of tourist commodities from mid-June 
to early 1995. 
  Wang Naili, director of the Shanghai Tourist Bureau, 
announced the plan at a press conference today. 
  He said that in the past two years, tourism services in 
Shanghai have seen rapid growth. Last year, about 1.25 million 
overseas tourists visited Shanghai, and the income in foreign 
currency increased by 49.7 percent over the previous year. 
  In the first five months this year, the city has received 
472,700 overseas tourists, an increase of 3.1 percent over the 
corresponding period last year. 
  However, Wang said, Shanghai's income from the sales of 
tourist commodities is on the decline. 
  Shanghai lacks commodities with Shanghai characteristics, he 
said. 
  The quality, packaging, and varieties of commodities are 
expected to be improved, he added. 
  The Shanghai Municipal Government decided to mobilize 20 
departments to jointly sponsor the Shanghai International 
Tourist Commodities Fair over the next few months. 
  The serial includes a new products show and a competition of 
the best ideas on the improvement of tourist commodities, a 
symposium on development of tourist commodities, a knowledge 
contest and selection of the ten best department stores.

  [Text] Beijing, June 15 (XINHUA) -- What do Chinese farmers 
do in their spare time? 
  In the suburban areas of Shanghai, China's largest city, 
farmers engage in collecting stamps and newspapers, taking 
photographs, dancing, organizing musical bands, and so on. A 
kind of existence that specialists call "suburban culture" is 
emerging there. 
  "Suburban culture" in Shanghai is characterized by the 
combination of modern city culture and traditional Chinese rural 
culture. Economic development in the rural areas provides it 
with good support. 
  Two brothers named Du collected various kinds of newspapers 
years ago. Now, they have collected 15,000 kinds of newspapers, 
to rank among China's top four newspaper collectors. They have 
published 5,000 digest stories. They have also finished the 
first editions of "a collection of masthead calligraphy in 
national evening newspapers" and "a collection of mastheads 
dedicated by Mao Zedong". 
  A group of farmer photographers has emerged in Shanghai. 
Some of their photographs have been sent overseas for 
exhibition. 
  A village named Maqiao on the outskirts of Shanghai has a 
long history of lion dancing. After being revised by the new 
generation of farmer artists, the lion dance has become a new 
type of folk dance combining gymnastics, dance and movie tricks 
together. 
  Musical bands are active in the countryside of Shanghai. 
Some of the folk orchestral music they have adapted or created 
has been welcomed not only by Shanghainese but also by people in 
other parts of China attending the Shanghai international art 
festival. 
  Entertainment equipment like video recorders, pianos, 
household computers and compact discs, which could only be seen 
in the houses of rich city dwellers in the past, have made their 
way into the households of ordinary farmers. 
  Rural farmers now frequently take part in singing and 
karaoke 
contests, piano grading concerts and instrumental concerts held 
in the city. 
  Modern cultural activities initiated in the big cities are 
spreading from the city districts to the suburbs, to outlying 
areas, and then to the surrounding country villages. 
  Fifteen "cultural hot points" currently popular in Shanghai 
districts can all be found in its outlying villages. 
  Experts have pointed out that the "suburban culture" 
characterized by its combination of traditional Chinese culture 
and modern urban culture, is a necessary result of China's 
economic and social development. And it will help to reduce the 
cultural gap between cities and the countryside.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Step Up Efforts To Crack Down on </F>
Major and Grave Economic Crimes and Further Deepen the 
Anticorruption Struggle"] 
  [Text] Yesterday [6 June], upon the closing of a telephone 
conference held by the Central Commission on Politics and Law 
[CCPL] on making unrelenting efforts to crack down on major and 
grave economic crimes, Li Zemin, secretary of the Zhejiang 
Provincial CPC Committee, set guidelines for party committees at 
all levels in Zhejiang on deepening the anticorruption struggle. 
He stressed: We must further unify our understanding, 
strengthen leadership, ensure a good job in dealing with major 
and grave cases of economic crimes, and deepen the 
anticorruption struggle to maintain the province's trend of 
reform, development, and stability. 
  After noting the considerably good results Zhejiang has 
achieved in dealing with major and grave cases of economic 
crimes since the Second Plenary Meeting of the Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission in August last year, Li Zemin 
pointed out: We should not overestimate the results we have 
achieved -- some corrupt practices are far from being 
effectively checked. Work in investigating major and grave 
cases occurring in key departments, especially crimes committed 
by leading cadres, is still a weak link -- it still falls far 
short of the expectations of the party Central Committee, the 
State council, and the masses. 
  Li Zemin said: The guidelines laid down by Comrade Ren 
Jianxin at the telephone conference concerning stepping up 
efforts to crack down on major and grave cases of economic 
crimes are important guidelines of the party Central Committee 
on fighting corruption, especially for cracking down on grave 
economic crimes. With the telephone conference as a turning 
point, and in conjunction with the relevant guidelines laid down 
by the provincial CPC Committee and government, party 
committees, governments, and public security, procuratorial, and 
judicial departments at all levels of the province should 
faithfully carry out the guidelines set at the telephone 
conference. 
  First, we should further unify our understanding of the 
great 
significance of the anticorruption struggle. Deepening the 
struggle is an important assurance for carrying out the guiding 
principle of "seizing the opportunity to deepen reform, broaden 
the scope of opening up, accelerate development, and maintain 
social stability," as well as an important effort to strengthen 
party building. We should further clear up the various vague 
ideas about the struggle currently existing among a small number 
of leading cadres, and correct their wrong way of doing things 
in order to bolster their anticorruption resolve and confidence. 
It should be made clear that anticorruption is an important 
assurance for the economy to develop smoothly, and in a healthy 
manner. We should preserve cadres' enthusiasm and initiative in 
carrying out reform and economic construction, but we must never 
defend or wink at their corrupt and criminal acts. Leaders at 
all levels, especially leading comrades of the party and 
government, should restudy Comrade Deng Xiaoping's discussion on 
tightly gripping with two hands, and Comrade Jiang Zemin's 
speech at the Third Plenary Meeting of the Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission; further unify their understanding of the 
great significance of the anticorruption struggle; and carry out 
the struggle unequivocally, justly, and forcefully, in order to 
further deepen the struggle and enable it to endure and yield 
better results. 
  Second, priority should be given to investigating and 
prosecuting major or serious cases. Vigorous efforts should be 
made to investigate such cases in key departments, especially 
major criminal cases involving leading cadres. Specialized 
organs should follow the mass line by encouraging people to 
report on criminal cases. We should conscientiously do a good 
job in making preliminary investigation of clues for solving 
cases. Party committees at various levels should support law 
and discipline enforcement departments in making preliminary 
investigation of cases. A case that should be investigated and 
prosecuted must be thoroughly investigated and prosecuted, no 
matter who is involved in the case. We should resolutely resist 
various personal connections and interceding for others. 
Interference in the handling of a case that constitutes a crime 
should also be investigated and prosecuted according to law. We 
should support law-enforcement departments in handling cases 
independently. We should conscientiously implement the 
principle of dealing promptly and severely with serious cases of 
economic crimes. When it is necessary to make a preliminary 
investigation of a case, we should do so; when a case should be 
placed on file for investigation and prosecution, we should do 
so; and when those involved in a case should be given severe 
sentences, we should also do so. Under the unified leadership 
of party committees, news media and propaganda departments 
should effectively report on and publicize typical major or 
serious cases in order to strengthen people's confidence in the 
struggle against corruption. Conscientiously implementing the 
principle of "being firm, prudent, and accurate," we should 
strictly distinguish between being guilty and being innocent. 
  Third, it is necessary to effectively strengthen our 
leadership over the anticorruption struggle, and the 
investigation and prosecution of major or serious cases. The 
anticorruption struggle is a task for the whole party. So the 
whole party should carry it out, and there should be personnel 
responsible for it at every level. We should make unremitting 
efforts to do solid work in this regard. We should 
conscientiously analyze and check on the anticorruption struggle 
according to the central authorities' requirements and the 
conditions of our localities or units. We should make further 
arrangements for the investigation and prosecution of major or 
serious cases, especially cases involving leading cadres. We 
should strengthen our supervision and inspection in this respect 
and vigorously implement relevant policies and measures. We 
should take the initiative in coordinating the investigation and 
prosecution of major or serious cases, especially cases 
involving leading cadres. All department concerned should make 
concerted efforts in handling such cases. Principal leaders of 
party and government organizations at various levels should 
concern themselves with the investigation and prosecution of 
major or serious cases, support law and discipline enforcement 
departments in handling cases according to law, help them remove 
obstructions, and back them in handling cases impartially. It 
is essential to improve law and discipline enforcement 
departments' equipment for the investigation of cases, and to 
make sure they have sufficient funds to handle cases, especially 
enough funds to investigate and prosecute major cases involving 
leading cadres. 
  Present at the telephone conference were Chai Songyue, 
deputy 
secretary of the provincial party committee and executive vice 
governor of the province; Wang Qichao, standing committee member 
of the provincial party committee and member of the provincial 
discipline inspection commission; Si Daxiao, member of the 
standing committee and secretary of the political and legal 
commission of the provincial party committee; Ge Shengping, 
procurator general of the provincial people's procuratorate; Lu 
Zushan, secretary general of the provincial party committee; and 
leaders of relevant departments.

<F P=106> [By Chan Wai-Fong] </F>
  [Text] Shenzhen hopes to improve its poor industrial 
safety record by requiring enterprises which employ more than 50 
workers to hire safety officers. 
  The measure, modelled on Hong Kong practice, will be 
implemented later this year. The Shenzhen Special Economic Zone 
(SEZ) will be the first in China to try this approach to 
industrial safety. 
  A government document issued last month indicates 
enterprises 
with 50 to 200 workers must hire an acting safety officer. 
Those with more than 200 must have a full-time one. 
  And for industries classified as dangerous, special safety 
units must be established. The same will apply to large-scale 
industries that control a number of subsidiaries, a Shenzhen 
municipal official responsible for labour safety said. 
  The official, who identified himself only as Mr Lo said 
training courses were being prepared for the safety officers, 
who would have to be registered with the government to be 
eligible for the job. 
  Although at present large-scale and state-controlled 
enterprises in China usually have safety units, they are not 
obligatory. And for foreign-funded factories, except in highly 
organised ones, safety units are a rarity. 
  Guangdong Labour Bureau safety chief Tan Shaofen said that 
when accidents happened in these enterprises, owners would be 
penalised. 
  Over the past two years serious industrial accidents have 
been reported in southern China, some resulting in hundreds of 
deaths and injuries, and occurring most often in factories 
funded by Hong Kong and Taiwan interests. 
  "It's futile simply to hold owners responsible," Mr Lo said. 
"And the newly issued document stipulates that anyone who wishes 
to open a factory has to employ safe ty officers" he said. 
  He said the new safety officers needed to be properly 
trained 
in the relevant laws and regulations, industrial safety, and 
what to do in case of accidents. 
  The new policy would be fully implemented in the SEZ within 
two years, Mr Lo said. Mr Tan said there was no plan at present 
to adopt the system in other parts of Guangdong, although he 
said Shenzhen was moving in the right direction. "We will keep 
a close eye on it," he said. 
  Mr Tan explained that "the system in Shenzhen is different. 
All enterprises there come directly under the SEZ government, 
while here we have bosses like the labour bureau, the union". 
  But he was quick to point out that foreign-funded 
enterprises 
could not be exempted from Chinese laws on industrial safety. 
  Mr Tan said his department suffered from a shortage of 
staff. 
This had paralyzed, to a certain extent, the enforcement of laws 
and regulations on industrial safety, particularly in 
foreign-funded enterprises. 
  "We have to rely on local governments to monitor the 
situation. They will be responsible for any accidents occurred. 
And the owners of foreign enterprises will also be charged," he 
said.

  [Text] Yulin Prefecture was hit by the No. 3 tropical 
storm between 8 and 11 June, resulting in economic losses 
totalling 76.27 million yuan. The people and troops stationed 
in Yulin have wasted no time in rushing to deal with the 
emergency and provide disaster relief. 
  The regional party committee and people's government have 
been concerned about the disaster situation. On the morning of 
13 June, regional party committee Secretary Zhao Fulin made a 
personal telephone call to principal leaders in charge of the 
Yulin Prefectural CPC Committee to inquire about the disaster 
situation. He also gave them the following three specific 
instructions with regard to disaster relief work: 
  1. The party and government leaders in each and every 
disaster-stricken city, county, township, and town should go 
deep into the disaster-stricken areas at once to learn about the 
disaster situation; organize cadres and masses to combat the 
disaster and provide disaster relief; take measures to tackle 
problems cropping up in the course of combating the disaster and 
providing disaster relief; resolve problems in a timely manner; 
and to reduce the losses caused by the disaster to a minimum; 
  2. The leaders at all levels in Yulin should take practical 
measures to help the broad masses of people tackle 
livelihood-related problems; organize the broad masses of people 
to provide for and help themselves by engaging in production; 
express sympathy and solicitude for the disaster-stricken 
households and collectives; mobilize the broad masses of people 
to help those in the disaster areas overcome difficulties 
relating to livelihood and production; and should take measures 
to save farm crops and reduce losses to a minimum; 
  3. The leaders and broad masses of cadres and people at all 
levels in Yulin should cultivate a strong sense of combating the 
disaster and reaping a good harvest. As the flood season has 
just started, Zhao said, we should be on the alert, never 
slacken vigilance, take measures to prevent and combat 
disasters, and strive to reap a good agricultural harvest this 
year.

  [Excerpts] Thanks to joint efforts exerted by working 
personnel responsible for inspecting commodity prices, our 
province has achieved initial results in its mass inspection of 
commodity prices. The inspection has taken selling at marked 
prices as a breakthrough point to straighten out market order 
and prices. As a result of hard work over the past two months, 
the practice of selling at marked prices has become increasingly 
popular. More than 95 percent of department stores, 95 to 96 
percent of eating houses, and 60 percent of supermarkets and 
individual traders have followed this practice. 
  Some 140,000 units were inspected and it was discovered that 
80,000 units had failed to abide by the relevant rules and 
regulations. Fines totalling more than 120,000 yuan were 
imposed. In the meantime, our inspection personnel also 
seriously handled cases of those units or individuals who 
increased prices arbitrarily before the promulgation of measures 
aimed at curbing price increases in light of the seriousness of 
their illegal practice. [passage indistinct] [passage omitted] 
  Our inspection personnel exerted their main efforts in 
inspecting 8,130 key units and discovered 2,343 law violation 
cases involving 15.49 million yuan. In the course of carrying 
out their inspection work, they also paid attention to handling 
cases reported by the masses. They dealt with a total of more 
than 1,200 cases reported by the masses, more than 1,000 cases 
of which were handled immediately. Although certain results 
have been achieved in the mass inspection work, there are still 
some problems: 
  First, the prices of a small number of daily necessities 
still remain high. 
  Second, it is more difficult to standardize prices on market 
fairs or set prices for individual traders. 
  Third, cases of our inspection personnel being besieged, 
scolded, and beaten still happen from time to time. 
  In future, relevant departments must truly take effective 
measures to promote the healthy development of our mass 
inspection work.

  [Text] The provincial government held an on-the-spot 
administrative meeting this morning in the Town and Township 
Enterprises Administrative Department in order to review the 
latest development of town and township enterprises throughout 
the province, and to further organize and mobilize forces from 
various quarters to continue supporting the development of town 
and township enterprises. Governor Jia Zhijie and Vice Governor 
Wang Shengtie attended the meeting to help town and township 
enterprises get funds, then and there, to a sum of 1.5 billion 
yuan. The provincial branch of the Agricultural Bank provided 
1.2 billion yuan, the provincial branch of the Industrial and 
Commercial Bank -- 120 million yuan, the provincial branch of 
the Bank of China -- 100 million yuan, and the provinical branch 
of the Construction Bank -- 80 million yuan. 
  This year town and township enterprises in our province have 
continued to maintain their good momentum of development. 
Various localities throughout the province generally have 
accelerated their pace of development, and have increased their 
economic efficiency markedly. Their products generally sell 
well. From January to May this year, the total production 
output value of rural industry was 26.9 billion yuan, an 
increase of 89.69 percent over the same period last year. 
  After listening to reports on supporting the development of 
town and township enterprises which were submitted by 
responsible persons from organs directly under provincial 
authorities, including the provincial planning commission, 
economic commission, labor department, educational commission, 
scientific and technological commission, the Agricultural Bank's 
provincial branch, and the provincial financial, personnel, and 
other departments, Governor Jia Zhijie said: This year, town 
and township enterprises are developing very rapidly and 
healthily. This has played a decisive role in maintaining the 
pace of economic development in our province. To continue the 
rapid development of town and township enterprises, we must make 
a breakthrough in enhancing our understanding. We must have 
sense of crisis and emergency. Party and government leaders at 
all levels must place the development of town and township 
enterprises on their agendas. Main leaders must grasp it 
personally. They must persist in the idea of doing two types of 
work simultaneously. They must grasp the development of town 
and township enterprises, and lose no time in improving them. As 
far as measures are concerned, they must adjust their targets of 
struggle to ensure the fulfillment of the task of increasing 
these enterprises' production output value to 150 billion yuan. 
It is necessary to open up markets, increase product sales, and 
establish sales teams for the markets for town and township 
enterprises. It is necessary to carry out activities of 
emulation and appraisal through comparison so as to create a 
situation of each and every enterprise trying to overtake the 
other. It is necessary to put the enhancement of management 
level on the agenda. Management must be put on a scientific and 
modern basis, and efforts must be made to attach importance to 
training qualified personnel so as to increase the quality of 
working personnel in town and township enterprises.

  [Text] The Hubei Poverty-Stricken Old Liberated Areas 
Development Fund was officially set up in Wuchang this morning. 
  This morning's ceremony was attended by some provincial 
leaders, including [provincial party committee Secretary] Guan 
Guangfu, Ding Fengying, Wang Zhongnong, Wang Shengtie, Zhen 
Guocheng, Xiao Quantao, and Xu Xiaochun; some retired veteran 
comrades including Han Ningfu, Kong Qingde, Liu Huinong, Zhang 
Xueqi, Shi Chuan and Tian Ying; and some other people. 
  The Hubei Poverty-Stricken Old Liberated Areas Development 
Fund is a nonprofitmaking and nongovernmental organization 
established with the approval of the Hubei Provincial CPC 
Committee and People's Government and composed of retired former 
provincial party, government, and military leaders, including 
some veteran generals and veteran leaders, some incumbent 
provincial leaders, as well as some relevant provincial 
departments leaders. 
  The fund pledges to fulfill such tasks as mobilizing and 
organizing overseas and domestic people from all walks of life, 
Overseas Chinese, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots, 
friendly people from all over the world, as well as overseas and 
domestic social organizations, enterprises, and undertakings to 
voluntarily donate and raise through a variety of channels, 
funds to help Hubei's poverty-stricken old liberated areas shake 
off poverty, achieve prosperity, and turn into spiritually and 
materially civilized areas. 
  At this morning's ceremony, Wang Liying was elected 
chairman. 
Guan Guangfu, Han Ningfu, Zhang Caiqian, Liu Huinong, Xu Qingde, 
Zhang Xiulong, Shen Yinluo, Chen Ming, and Jiang Yi were elected 
honorary chairmen. 
  Guan Guangfu delivered a speech in which he said: On behalf 
of the Hubei Provincial CPC Committee and People's Government, I 
would like to extend warm congratulations to the newly 
established fund as well as heartfelt thanks to retired veteran 
leaders, veteran comrades, and people from all walks of life in 
society for their unreserved concern for the old liberated areas 
development. 
  Guan Guangfu stated: The provincial party committee and 
people's government have been concerned about the backward 
situation in the old liberated areas and have always attached 
great importance to, and made continued efforts to push ahead 
with, the old liberated areas development. Nonetheless, due to 
lack of construction funds, Hubei's old liberated areas 
development has lagged far behind other areas in the province. 
  Guan Guangfu expressed the hope that all areas, departments, 
professions, and trades across the province, and people from all 
walks of life in society, will show continued concern, support, 
and assistance for Hubei's old liberated areas development; show 
concern for, attach importance to, and provide assistance to 
each and every investment activity developed by the newly

poverty-stricken old liberated areas development.

Zhongnong, Wang Shengtie, Zhen Guocheng, Han Ningfu, Kong 
Qingde, Liu Huinong, Zhang Xueqi, Wang Liying, and others, 
became the first group of people to donate cash to the newly

  [Text] Wuhan, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Central China's Hubei 
Province has opened seven customs posts dealing with foreign 
goods since 1980, boasting the biggest number among the inland 
provinces of the country. 
  The customs posts are at the two ports of Wuhan and 
Huangshi, 
Wuhan's Nanhu Airport, and at Shashi, Huangzhou, Ezhou and 
Jiangan. 
  In 1993 the province's total quantity of export goods was 
one 
million tons, with an export value of 1.68 billion U.S. dollars. 
  The province plans to set up more customs posts along the 
Chang Jiang and Hanjiang Rivers, and its four major railway 
lines.

<F P=106> [By Liang Chao: "High Temps Deplete Reservoirs"] </F>
  [Text] A senior expert yesterday declared that the current 
18-month drought is the worst of the century. 
  "The capital city is rapidly reaching water scarcity and 
facing limits to further economic development due to the 
persistent spell of dry weather," said Teng Shutang, the 
general-engineer of Beijing Municipal Water Resources Bureau. 
  Meanwhile, the municipal Water Saving Office urged residents 
and institutions to comply with measures aimed at cutting water 
consumption, which has been steadily on the rise this year. 
  The office pleaded that an acute water shortage will appear 
in the next three months, saying the supply exceeded its 
capacity of 1.04 million tons a day last week as the mercury 
crept above 30 degrees Celsius. 
  Teng has resorted to shock-therapy in trying to get city 
residents to understand the depths of the drought. 
  He said Beijing has been heavily relying on its only limited 
water stored in its two largest reservoirs, the Miyun and 
Guanting. Both are fed only by annual rainfall. 
  Beijing needs at least 1 billion cubic metres of water from 
the two reservoirs to meet its basic consumption needs each 
year, Teng said. This sole water source has been forced to 
yield an extra 500 million cubic metres of water from its 
reserves as rainfall has decreased sharply in recent years . 
  "The reserve storage of water will be used up in the next 
few 
years without effective water-saving measures with the prolonged 
scorching weather," Teng warned. 
  "Beijing would be at standstill." 
  The reservoirs have seen their supply depleted with the 
minuscule precipitation of the last three years: 490 
millimeters in 1992, only 420 millimetres in 1993 and even less 
predicted for this year. 
  Consequently, only 1.6 billion cubic metres were retained in 
the reservoirs in 1993, less than 24 percent compared with 
levels in the 1980s. 
  This year only 2.68 billion cubic metres, about half of the 
Miyun Reservoir's designed storage capacity, was stored. Only 
1.6 billion cubic metres of the stored water are available for 
daily use by the city's more than 6 million dwellers as well as 
tourists and industries. 
  Further, for years water quality in Guanting has been too 
poor for drinking, he said.

Shengrong (0491 3932 2837): "Inner Mongolia Witnesses Fruitful 
Results in Holding Talks on Mutual Aid and Economic Cooperation 
With Beijing and Hebei"] 
  [Text] A few days ago, Inner Mongolia achieved fruitful 
results in visiting Beijing Municipality and Hebei Province to 
hold talks with them on aiding each other and on organizing 
economic and technological cooperation. 
  Lin Yongsan, vice chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous 
Region, Wang Baosen, executive vice mayor of Beijing 
Municipality, and Li Haifeng, vice governor of Hebei Province, 
respectively signed two "summaries of talks" on bilateral 
cooperation. Meanwhile, 12 leagues and cities in Inner Mongolia 
signed agreements on aiding each other "one to one" with 
pertinent districts and counties of Beijing Municipality and 
with corresponding prefectures and cities of Hebei Province. 
Through the current visit to Beijing and Hebei, Inner Mongolia 
reached 403 agreements and intentions on cooperation in the 
fields of the economy, technology, goods and materials, and 
professionals. Thus, a new breakthrough was made in the major 
cooperation items between Hebei, Beijing, and Inner Mongolia. 
  In the cooperation on power industry between Inner Mongolia 
and Beijing Municipality, this year Beijing will continue to put 
in construction funds to Inner Mongolia, and beginning next year 
Beijing will participate in the construction of key power plants 
of Inner Mongolia in the form of buying shares. Inner Mongolia 
and Beijing also reached the cooperation intention on lending 
money to support Inner Mongolia's copper smelting and zinc 
smelting projects, on jointly building wholesale markets in 
Beijing that mainly sell the grain and cooking oil of Inner 
Mongolia, and on jointly building bases of raw materials, fine 
variety of livestock products, vegetables, meat, milk, poultry 
eggs, and melon and fruits in Inner Mongolia. 
  In the field of the cooperation between Inner Mongolia and 
Hebei Province, the region and the province decided through 
discussion that this year Hebei Province will organize special 
teams to conduct survey on the spot and conduct specific 
negotiations on the form of investment and on the price of 
electricity used in jointly building Zhenglanqi Power Plant. It 
was also decided that the No. 110 state highway from Hebei 
Province's Chaigoubao to Inner Mongolia's Laoyemiao will be 
built according to the standards of the second-grade highway and 
this highway will be open to traffic by the end of 1995. The 
two sides have also reached intention on improving the 
communications and transportation conditions in other 
prefectures, cities, and leagues in Inner Mongolia and Hebei, on 
building and perfecting the markets in contiguous areas, and on 
jointly building the bases of building materials and raw 
materials in Inner Mongolia. 
  The region's current visit to Beijing and Hebei drew high 
attention of party and government leaders of Beijing and Hebei. 
Chen Xitong, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central 
Committee and secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party 
Committee, Cheng Weigao, secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party 
Committee, and other leaders met with all members of the 
delegation of Inner Mongolia and exchanged opinions on 
continuously deepening the mutual aid. 
  Beijing Municipality expressed that it will strive to 
initiate another 1,100 cooperation projects within a few years 
based on the 1,100 projects ever conducted in the past. 
  At the moment, pertinent departments, leagues, and cities of 
Inner Mongolia are making positive arrangements for building the 
project signed during the current visit.

  [Text] Taiyuan, June 16 (XINHUA) -- A foreign-funded 
agricultural project has brought benefits to some 300,000 
farmers living in mountainous areas in north China's Shanxi 
Province. 
  Initiated in 1991, the program is aimed at improving soil, 
and building water conservancy and irrigation facilities. 
  The 314 million yuan (about 36 million U.S. dollars) 
involved 
comes partly from loans offered by the International Fund for 
Agricultural Development. 
  Now the per-capita income of farmers in the five 
poverty-stricken counties has increased by 70 yuan (about eight 
U.S. dollars) a year. 
  Three more foreign-aided projects are under way in the 
province, focusing on water and soil preservation. One is 
financed by the World Bank, another by the World Food Program, 
and the third by Japan.

  [Text] Tianjin, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Optometry, a 
traditional technique passed on from generation to generation in 
China, now has become an applied major subject in universities 
here. 
  In co-operation with a Japanese vocational school, Tianjin 
Medical University started its first optometry course in 1991, 
and it is still the only one in China. 
  The course covers medical and optical knowledge, and 
materials science. 
  Other subjects urgently needed as the Chinese economy 
expands 
have also entered the ivory tower, such as toy engineering, 
fashion design, advertising, appraisal and marketing of jewelry, 
indoor decoration and gardening. 
  Toy engineering is offered by the Tianjin Light Industry 
Institute. Associate Professor Wang Yuliang said that the 
evolution of toys is closely linked with human progress and 
scientific development. 
  Wang noted that the toy industry in China can only match the 
1960s level of the advanced countries. At present, China 
produces 7,000 kinds of toys, a fraction of the world total. 
  China now has more than 1,000 toy makers, but only one such 
major in institutes of higher learning. So it is no wonder that 
all students are snapped up every year upon graduation, Wang 
said.

  [Text] Changchun, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China's 
Jilin Province, one of the country's major grain producers, has 
scored great achievements in the development of export-oriented 
agricultural production. 
  Making full use of local natural and land resources, the 
province has stepped up the construction of processing 
enterprises for farm products, especially value-added products. 
  Last year its total export of agricultural products and by- 
products was 880 million U.S. dollars-worth, over 50 percent of 
the total export volume of the province. 
  Foreign funds have been used in this endeavor. 
  Nearly 100 foreign-funded agricultural firms were founded in 
1993, with a total contracted investment of 42 million U.S. 
dollars. The actual use of foreign funds by the province was 390 
million U.S. dollars last year. 
  Jilin is well known for its ginseng and wild vegetables on 
the world market. The provincial government has issued 
preferential policies to support the production and processing 
of some key products such as ginseng and mushrooms and flowers. 
  The province exports chicken meat to Japan, the Republic of 
Korea and other countries.

  [Text] Beijing, 15 Jun (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, member of 
the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee 
and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], had a meeting at the 
Great Hall of the People this morning with the delegation of the 
Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong headed by its 
president Herbert Liang. 
  When the meeting began, Li Ruihuan congratulated the 
association on its 60th founding anniversary and welcomed the 
association's friends to visit Beijing. He said: The Chinese 
Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong is a business group with 
extensive influence. Over the years you have accomplished a 
great deal of work in promoting Hong Kong's prosperity and 
development, as well as in supporting China's reform, opening 
up, and modernization. I hope you will continue to work hard to 
make new contributions to Hong Kong's stability and prosperity 
before and after 1997. 
  Li Ruihuan said: The "one country, two systems" principle is 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's great creation which is in line with the 
interests of all the Chinese people, including our countrymen in 
Hong Kong, and it has important and far-reaching significance. 
We will unswervingly implement this principle. He pointed out: 
Much work remains to be done in implementing the "one country, 
two systems" principle and in maintaining Hong Kong's smooth 
transition and its stability and prosperity after 1997. Just 
like accomplishing all other projects, we must strategically 
despise them but tactically take them seriously. So not only 
must we have the determination and confidence, but we must also 
have the capabilities and methods for accomplishing them. 
  He urged countrymen in Hong Kong to unite as closely as 
possible and contribute more to the process of achieving the 
goal that "Hong Kong is to be governed by Hong Kong citizens 
themselves."

  [Text] Beijing, June 15 (XINHUA) -- Chinese leader Li 
Ruihuan said here today that there is much to be done in 
implementing the principle of "one country, two systems" and 
maintaining Hong Kong's smooth transition, stability and 
prosperity. 
  As in other activities, he said, "strategically we should

National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, made these remarks at a meeting with a

Kong led by its president Herbert Liang. 
  He said the principle of "one country, two systems" has been 
created by Deng Xiaoping, which conforms to the interests of the 
Chinese people including the Hong Kong compatriots and is of 
important and far-reaching significance. 
  "We will unswervingly implement this principle," he added. 
  Li urged the Hong Kong compatriots to unite and make more 
contributions to the process of realizing that Hong Kong is 
governed by Hong Kong citizens themselves. 
  During the meeting, Li congratulated the Chinese 
Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong on the 60th anniversary 
of its founding. 
  He noted a great deal of work that the association has done

world and its modernizations.

efforts to contribute to Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.

<F P=106> [By Shiny Li] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong's top policy makers are skeptical of 
recent conciliatory moves by China to resolve some of the 
biggest disagreements over the territory's future after 1997. 
  Privately, senior officials have voiced doubts over 
Beijing's 
surprise announcement this week that the rows over funding for 
the new Chek Lap Kok airport and the fate of 38 military sites 
in Hong Kong could be resolved rapidly. 
  Senior government sources said: "Don't put too much store by 
China's recent statements. We have to wait and see." 
  They said they did not expect those issues -- under 
negotiation for some years to be resolved so quickly. 
  China and Britain have yet to reach agreement over the 
future 
of the military sites, although there has been "good progress" 
during the 16th round of expert talks. 
  The Sino-British talks will be concluded today. 
  Briefed on the progress of negotiations, the Executive 
Council expressed reservations over a Chinese proposal that the 
council provide a written commitment that sites not used for 
military purposes after 1997 will be turned over to the Special 
Administrative Region (SAR) for commercial use. 
  Britain had previously insisted on a formal agreement. 
  Another sticking point, sources said, was the budget for the 
new naval base on Stonecutters Island and facilities of other 
military sites. 
  Even though the two sides had agreed that the size of the 
new 
naval base would be reduced, the Chinese side never spelt out 
what would be the exact budget for building the naval port and 
the facilities of other military sites, such as dormitories for 
the People's Liberation Army (PLA). 
  The sources said the government had a "reasonable" amount in 
mind and would try to lobby the legislators party by party for 
funding support. 
  Also yesterday, it was announced that the plenary Joint 
Liaison Group (JLG) meeting would take place from 21 to 23 June.

  [Text] Beijing, June 16 KYODO -- A Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said Thursday [16 June] a 1961 Chinese-North 
Korean treaty guaranteeing mutual military aid in case of 
invasion "remains in force." 
  Shen Guofang, speaking at a weekly ministry briefing, 
refused 
to go into details about the 1961 treaty, saying only there is 
still room and the possibility for the participants involved in 
the nuclear issue on North Korea to arrive at "a proper 
settlement." 
  Article 3 of the 1961 Sino-North Korean Mutual Aid Treaty 
stipulates that if either China or North Korea is invaded by a 
third country, mutual aid will be offered to the country under 
invasion. "When one of the signatory countries of the treaty 
enters a state of war due to the military attack of another 
country or its ally, then the other signatory country must 
immediately, to the extent of its authority, offer military and 
other aid," the treaty states in a Japanese translation. 
  Shen, reiterating that China does not want to see the 
development of such a situation, said, "it is our hope that all 
the parties concerned choose not to talk about war but talk 
about ways for solving the nuclear issue." 
  He did not comment on North Korea's unilateral position that 
any UN sanctions will be treated as "a declaration of war" but 
said, "we hope that the interested parties will carry on their 
dialogues and try to relax the tensions in order to find a 
proper solution in the end." 
  The UN Security Council is considering implementing 
sanctions 
on North Korea in an effort to urge the Stalinist state to 
accept international inspections of its suspected nuclear 
weapons program. 
  The treaty could be seen as a good indication that China 
will 
use its power as a permanent member of the UN Security Council 
to veto any sanctions resolution, analysts said. The treaty, 
signed by the late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and North Korea 
leader Kim Il-song, also stipulates that neither signatory will 
join any kind of international bloc against the other signatory.

  [Text] Beijing, June 16 (AFP) -- China rejected Thursday a 
U.S. draft resolution calling for UN sanctions against North 
Korea over the nuclear issue, saying it was still not too late 
to return to the negotiating table. "China in principle doesn't 
subscribe to the involvement of the Security Council in the 
nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula or resorting to sanctions 
to solving it," foreign ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told 
journalists when asked for China's view of the draft. "China 
believes that the only way to a proper solution is direct 
dialogue held between the parties concerned," Shen told a weekly 
news briefing, urging all sides to make every effort to ensure a 
return to talks rather than resorting to action that could lead 
to confrontation. "We believe there is still room and the 
possiblity for a proper solution to this issue," Shen said. 
  The United States presented UN Security Council members 
Wednesday with the draft of a resolution calling for phased 
sanctions against North Korea after it this week pulled out of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). China, which has 
veto powers as a permanent member of the Security Council, has 
consistently opposed calls for sanctions against its communist 
ally. Despite reiterating this stance, Shen avoided questions 
on whether China would vote against the UN resolution or simply 
abstain. China has abstained, rather than use its veto power in 
past admonishments of Pyongyang's failure to live up to its 
commitment under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which it 
signed in 1985. Last week, China abstained from an IAEA vote to 
suspend technical assistance to North Korea in response to its 
refusal to allow inspectors access to its nuclear facilities. 
  The spokesman said that, "we regret the action the IAEA took 
on June 10 and the consequences that action has already caused," 
warning of the dangers of further heightening tensions. "At the 
present time, none of the parties involved has evidence showing 
that North Korea has developed nuclear arms," the spokesman 
said. "Before this is clarified, it would not be advisable to 
take action that might lead to the intensification of the 
confrontation and even to the outbreak of war. It would be 
ridiculous that, before an atomic bomb is completed, a war has 
broken out. That would not be good for any of the sides," he 
said. 
  Shen acknowledged that a 1961 agreement of friendship and 
mutual assistance between China and North Korea remained in 
force, but would not be drawn on whether the treaty obliged 
Beijing to give military assistance to its ally in case of war. 
"It is our hope that the parties concerned will chose not to 
talk about war but talk about ways of solving the nuclear 
issue," he said.

Minister Vo Van Kiet arrives in Moscow later today for a 
three-day official visit to Russia. 
  This is the first time for the Vietnamese premier to meet 
with top Russian leaders since the break-up of the Soviet Union. 
  "While on a visit to the Russian Federation, we shall attach 
much importance to strengthening the relations of traditional 
friendship and cooperation between our two countries in various 
fields," Vo Van Kiet said in Hanoi before his departure, 
according to the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY. 
  Sources of the Russian Foreign Ministry said a treaty on the 
principles of friendly relations between Russia and Vietnam is 
to be signed during the visit. The treaty is expected to

  [Text] Phnom penh, June 16 (XINHUA) -- The two-day round 
table talks of the working group on peace and national 
reconciliation in Cambodia broke down here today without 
reaching any agreement. 
  After today's closed-door meeting, a spokeman of the 
Cambodian Royal Government and the National Assembly told 
reporters that the meeting is over without any result. However, 
he did not want to say "the meeting has failed." 
  The spokesman said today's meeting discussed the cease-fire 
issue only and did not deal with the minimun political platform 
proposed by the Democratic Kampuchea Party (DKP). 
  The government side insisted on reaching an agreement on the 
timetable of the cease-fire first, but the DKP wanted to discuss 
details of setting up a cease-fire committee. 
  The government side noted that there is no need to meet 
again 
as the two round-table talks ended fruitlessly while the DKP 
suggested continuation of the talks. 
  Nhiek Tioulong, representative of King Norodom Sihanouk, 
said 
he will report to the king about the talks and Sihanouk would 
decide whether or not to continue the talks.

  [Text] Beijing, June 13 (XINHUA) -- PRC Premier Li Peng on 
11 June sent to the 30th summit of the Organization of African 
Unity [OAU] a message warmly congratulating the OAU on its 30th 
summit. The full text of the message follows: 
  To the OAU summit: 
  On the occasion of triumphant convocation of the 30th OAU 
summit, I hereby extend to it my warm congratulations on behalf 
of the Chinese Government and people. 
  The birth of new South Africa with Nelson Mandela as its 
president, and its attendance at the current summit as the 53d 
OAU member signify the inspiring great victory accomplished by 
the OAU and all African people in the political field, showing 
the further strengthening of unity and solidarity on the African 
continent. The admission of new South Africa to the OAU has 
added a new vitality to the African people in their efforts to 
seek a better future under the banner of the OAU, and has also 
ushered in a new epoch in the history of the OAU. We 
wholeheartedly wish the African people constant, new successes 
in their struggle to defend national independence and 
sovereignty, safeguard Africa's solidarity and unity, and 
improve living conditions. 
  We are glad to learn that the African Economic Community 
Treaty has officially become effective. The acceleration of 
Africa's economic integration is of great significance to 
African people's revitalization of the African economy through a 
collective self-reliance. It shows the firm will and 
determination of African countries and people to become united 
and make themselves stronger in an unfavorable international 
environment. The Chinese Government and people greatly admire 
their will and determination and wholeheartedly hope that the 
African people's collective efforts in the economic field will 
succeed. 
  With the changing international situation, it has become 
more 
and more important to maintain political stability in African 
countries so as to facilitate their economic development. 
Continued turbulence in some regions, and fighting in Rwanda in 
particular, has already taken a heavy toll and wrecked the 
economy, which has aroused widespread concern in the 
international community. We firmly support the OAU in its 
efforts to mediate in regional conflicts in Africa and maintain 
political and social stability in African countries. 
  A profound friendship has been forged between China and 
African nations during long, common struggles. Under the 
present complex international situation, we should even more 
sympathize with and support each other, and make joint efforts 
to strengthen Sino-African solidarity and cooperation. The 
Chinese Government and people treasure very much the 
Sino-African friendship. To strengthen friendship and 
cooperation with Africa has always been an important part of the 
foreign policy of the Chinese Government no matter how 
international situation changes. 
  I am convinced that the current summit will certainly 
achieve 
its desired results and triumphantly accomplish the lofty 
missions assigned by African nations and people. 
  I wish the summit a complete success! 
  [Signed] Li Peng, premier of the State Council of the 
People's Republic of China 
  [Dated] 11 June 1994, Beijing.

XINHUA reporters Zhu Youdi (2612 1635 2769) and Yin Hongzhu 
(1438 7703 4376)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 14 Jun (XINHUA) -- A national education 
conference convened by the CPC Central Committee and State 
Council opened today. Party and state leaders including Jiang 
Zemin, Li Peng, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, and Hu Jintao attended 
today's meeting. Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC 
Central Committee and state president delivered an important 
speech. On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and State 
Council, Premier Li Peng made a report on the situation in 
education. 
  The current national conference is an important meeting 
being 
held by the CPC Central Committee and State Council under the 
new situation in which China is accelerating the establishment 
of a socialist market economic structure and the modernization 
drive. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's 
basic line, the main tasks of the conference are to implement 
the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee; further carry out the strategy of giving 
priority to the development of education; mobilize the whole 
party and entire society to seriously implement the "Outline of 
the Reform and Development of China's Education"; and struggle 
for realization of the goals of China's reform and the 
development of education in the 1990's. 
  In his speech, Jiang Zemin pointed out: Since the Third 
Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, under the 
leadership of party committees and governments at various levels 
and with the hard work of the broad masses of educational 
workers, China's education work has developed rapidly; 
educational reform has expanded gradually; and great 
achievements have been made in education. This has raised 
quality, cultivated a vast number of capable people, and made 
important contributions to national economic construction, 
scientific and technological progress, and social development. 
On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and State Council, Jiang 
expressed high respect for the broad masses of teachers and 
educational workers who have been working hard on the 
educational front, and to people of various circles in society 
who have shown concern for and supported education. 
  Jiang Zemin said: The CPC Central Committee and Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping have always attached importance to education, and have 
considered it a fundamental issue linked with the socialist 
modernization drive and the history and fate of socialism, when 
formulating an overall strategy for the building of socialism 
with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
expositions on education are the theoretical basis for our party 
in formulating principles and policies for education in the new 
period; and have provided us with a powerful ideological weapon 
and orientation for the reform and development of education. 
Comrades of the whole party, especially leading cadres at 
various levels, must conscientiously understand Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's thinking on education when they study his theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Like Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping, they should attach importance to education from 
the high plane of strategy and promote the reform and 
development of education. 
  Jiang Zemin emphatically pointed out: In our country 
with a population of nearly 1.2 billion, and relatively 
inadequate resources and comparatively backward economic and 
cultural [wen hua 2429 0553] conditions, what must we rely on in 
realizing the grand goal of the socialist modernization drive? 
A decisive thing is to shift the focus of economic construction 
to the track of relying on scientific and technological 
progress, and of raising the quality of our laboring people. We 
must truly give priority to the development of education and 
place it in a strategic position; and strive to raise the level 
of ideology, ethics, science, and culture of the whole nation. 
This plan is of fundamental importance in achieving our 
country's modernization. 
  Jiang Zemin asked leading cadres at various levels to fully 
understand the need to vigorously develop education, speed up 
the training of people for the socialist modernization drive, 
and raise the quality of ideology, ethics, science, and 
education. He said: This is a necessary requirement in 
implementing the party's basic line, and is also a necessary 
requirement for unswervingly adhering to the party's basic line 
for 100 years. Only when we promote education can we 
fundamentally strengthen our country's comprehensive strength, 
and win strategic initiative in the fierce world competition. 
Only when we raise one generation of successors after another 
with high ideals, moral integrity, a good general education, and 
a sense of discipline, who will dedicate themselves to the cause 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, can we 
guarantee a long period of stability. In the entire course of 
building socialist modernization, we must unswervingly and 
always adhere to the strategic policy of giving priority to the 
development of education. 
  Jiang Zemin pointed out: In order to accelerate the reform 
and development of education, we must fully implement the 
"Outline of the Reform and Development of Education" formulated 
by the CPC Central Committee and State Council. This is not 
just important for various education departments but is also 
important for the whole party and entire society. Party 
committees and governments at various levels must effectively 
strengthen their leadership over education work, formulate 
specific measures for developing education in light of actual 
local conditions, be meticulous in making plans, and implement 
the measures and plans with unified arrangements. 
  Touching on the issue of respecting teachers and attaching 
importance to education, Jiang Zemin said: The hope of 
revitalizing the nation lies in education and the hope of 
revitalizing education depends on teachers. Teachers are the 
engineers of the people's soul. A teachers' job is noble and 
hard, and they should be respected by the whole party and entire 
society. In showing respect for teachers and attaching 
importance to education, leading cadres at various levels must 
take the lead, especially senior leading cadres. We must 
seriously implement the "Teachers' Law," safeguard teachers' 
lawful rights and interests, raise their remuneration according 
to relations, and create necessary conditions for their working, 
studying, and living conditions. 
  Jiang Zemin also pointed out that schools of different kinds 
at various levels should fully implement the party's policy on 
education, adhere to the socialist orientation in running 
schools, and strive to cultivate new people with "high ideas, 
moral integrity, a good general education and sense of 
discipline"; and enable them to develop morally, intellectually, 
and physically. In light of the new situation and problems 
emerging in the course of reform and construction, we should 
constantly strengthen and improve ideological and political work 
and ethical education in schools. Jiang said the whole society 
should show concern for and protect the healthy growth of 
students and join efforts to create a favorable environment for 
cultivating new people. 
  Jiang Zemin especially mentioned the issue of integrating 
education with production and labor. He said: This issue has 
been clearly defined in the "Outline of Reform and Development 
of Education." It is an important component part of our 
education policy because the integration of education with 
production and labor is a basic measure in adhering to a 
socialist orientation in education. 
  Jiang Zemin stressed: One of our basic national 
conditions is that we are developing education on a large scale 
under a situation in which the country is rather backward 
economically. Basing ourselves on this reality, we must deepen 
educational reform in order to make our educational structure 
and system conform to the needs of the development of a 
socialist market economy and all-around social progress. No 
matter what financial difficulties we face, we must be willing 
to invest in education in order to ensure success in the system 
of nine-year compulsory education, because this project will lay 
the foundation for raising the quality of the whole nation. The 
masses of educators in educational departments and schools 
should further emancipate their minds, seek truth from facts, 
vigorously explore new ways to develop education and establish a 
new educational structure under socialist market economic 
conditions, and strive to build a socialist educational system 
with Chinese characteristics. 
  In conclusion, Jiang Zemin stressed: It is a very glorious 
and arduous task to fulfill the grand objective of China's 
educational reform and development in the 1990's. Through our 
efforts over the past four decades, our educational undertaking 
has developed considerably, particularly in the past 15 years 
since the introduction of reform and opening up to the outside 
world. We have accumulated valuable experiences in educational 
reform, and a contingent of tens of millions of teachers has 
taken shape. All this has laid a sound foundation for 
educational reform and future development. The Central 
Committee believes that under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line, the Chinese nation's 
educational undertaking will surely continue to develop and 
prosper so long as we give strategic priority to developing 
education, seize opportunities, and thoroughly implement the 
"Outline of the Reform and Development of Education." 
  In his report entitled: "Let Us Mobilize and Vigorously 
Implement the `Outline of the Reform and Development of 
Education,'" Li Peng affirmed China's educational achievements 
scored since the introduction of reform and opening up to the 
outside world. He said: At present, China's reform and opening 
up to the outside world and its socialist modernization drive 
have entered a new period of development. Fundamentally 
speaking, economic construction and social progress must rely on 
science, technology, and education. To meet the needs of 
establishing a socialist market economic structure and to take 
on the development opportunities and challenges in the 21st 
century, we must further deepen educational reform, accelerate 
educational development, raise the quality of the whole nation, 
and train cross-century personnel for realizing our strategic 
objective of economic and social development. This is an urgent 
task confronting us. 
  Li Peng said: The "Outline of the Reform and Development of 
Education," promulgated by the CPC Central Committee and State 
Council, is a programmatic document for the development of 
education in China. To realize the development objectives set 
in the "Outline," we must concentrate on fulfilling the 
following tasks: First, efforts should be made to popularize 
nine-year compulsory education and to basically eliminate 
illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. This forms the 
basic requirement for raising the quality of the whole nation 
and is also the most important measure for developing education 
in China in the days to come. This task is difficult to realize 
in the countryside, particularly in frontier areas, remote 
areas, and poor areas. Governments at all levels should help 
these areas enforce compulsory education. In the course of 
doing so, they should integrate agricultural science with 
education in light of local conditions and make this a 
fundamental measure for helping poor areas free themselves from 
poverty and become well-off. Second, vigorous efforts should be 
made to develop vocational and adult education. In accordance 
with the need for primary and intermediate specialized personnel 
and with the degree of popularization of basic education, 
efforts should be made to divert graduates of elementary and 
middle schools to vocational schools in a planned way. This is 
the sure way to accelerate the heightening of laborers' quality 
and to invigorate the economy. Third, efforts should be made to 
develop higher education by focusing on raising the quality of 
education and raising efficiency in running schools. Through 
reform, we should mainly rely on a new way of developing higher 
education to an appropriate scale with a reasonable structure 
and strive to achieve a marked improvement in quality and 
efficiency. 
  Li Peng said: We must deepen educational reform in an 
all-around way to promote the development of education. The 
establishment of the socialist market economic structure has 
created an opportunity and motive force for educational reform 
and development, but at the same time it also calls for 
accelerating the pace of educational reform and the integration 
of education with economic development in order to gradually 
build a socialist educational system with Chinese 
characteristics. We should readjust the education structure by 
giving priority to raising the quality of laborers and to 
vigorously developing vocational education. It must be clearly 
understood that for a long period of time, an important and 
urgent task of education in China is to vigorously develop 
vocational education on the basis of popularizing nine-year 
compulsory education. This is a fundamental method of training 
a large number of applied personnel, a method which conforms to 
the national conditions in China. 
  Li Peng said: It is necessary to reform the system of 
running schools by gradually establishing a system in which the 
government plays the central role in running them, and all walks 
of life pool their funds to expand education. Basic education, 
particularly compulsory education, should be run mainly by the 
government. At the same time, enterprises, institutions, and 
other social forces should be encouraged to run various types of 
schools. Vocational and adult education should be mainly 
undertaken by trades, enterprises, institutions, and social 
organizations under government management, or they may be 
undertaken jointly by social organizations and individual 
citizens with the government's support. In higher education, we 
will practice the system under which schools of higher learning 
will mainly be run by the government while all sectors of 
society will participate in joint efforts to expand such 
education. We should straighten out the relationship among the 
government, society, and schools in accordance with the 
characteristics of various levels and types of education, and 
establish a scientific management system. We should reform the 
enrollment system in schools of higher learning, senior 
secondary schools, secondary schools, as well as vocational 
schools above the secondary level; and also reform their tuition 
collection system and system of assigning jobs to graduates. We 
should carefully draw up a reform program, strengthen propaganda 
and ideological work, and properly handle the relationship 
between reform and stability. 
  Li Peng pointed out: To develop education, we must expand 
the contingent of teachers, and increase teachers' pay and 
benefits. We should strive to run teachers' colleges well, 
encourage outstanding students to enroll in teachers' colleges, 
and also encourage graduates of such colleges to be happy in 
taking teaching as their profession. Efforts should be made to 
heighten teachers' ideological, professional, and teaching 
standards. 
  In his report, Li Peng stressed: It is necessary to 
strengthen and improve moral education in schools and heighten 
their teaching quality. Faced with the new situation and new 
requirements, we must effectively improve party leadership, 
strengthen and improve moral education in schools, and strive to 
explore new ideas for improving moral education under the new 
situation so that the traditional virtues and glorious 
traditions of the Chinese nation will be carried forward by the 
younger generation in conjunction with the spirit of the times. 
  Li Peng pointed out: Party committees and governments at all 
levels should strengthen their leadership over educational work 
and strive to do solid work to expand education. He proposed 
specific measures and requirements on increasing investment in 
education, improving the system of raising educational funds 
through various channels, upgrading teachers' social status and 
wages, putting an end to the practice of not paying teachers on 
time, and strengthening education-related legislation. 
  In conclusion, he called on party and government leaders at 
all levels to give strategic priority to developing education 
and to strive to fulfill the objectives and tasks set in the 
"Outline of the Reform and Development of Education." 
  Today's conference was presided over by Vice Premier Li 
Lanqing. 
  Also attending the conference were Li Tieying, Zou Jiahua, 
Chen Xitong, Qian Qichen, Fei Xiaotong, Sun Qimeng, Lei 
Jieqiong, Tomur Dawamat, Song Jian, Li Guixian, Ismail Amat, Hu 
Sheng, and Qian Zhengying; leading comrades of Central Committee 
and government departments, provinces, autonomous regions, 
municipalities, and cities with province-level economic 
decision-making authority; leading comrades of democratic 
parties; responsible comrades of the educational departments of 
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities; as well as 
the representatives of other relevant departments.

  [Text] Beijing, June 15 (CNS) -- The Chinese Academy of 
Social Sciences [CASS] invited tenders for the first time for 
some of its key research projects in order to encourage 
researchers to take up difficult subjects and to produce 
substantive success. Such a practice is aimed at enabling the 
academy to further build up a competitive and incentive 
mechanism. 
  The Director of the Scientific Research Bureau of the 
academy 
Mr. He Bingmeng, said in an interview with this agency that the 
academy had formulated regulations of such bidding on a trial 
basis. He added that the regulations stated that the academy 
would offer public bidding each year for some key research 
projects in order to ensure high quality results. 
  The traditional practice employed by the academy for key 
projects started with applications by each of its institutes 
which would be discussed by the Scientific Research Bureau. The 
applications were then submitted to the academy for final 
appraisal and approval. The main shortcoming of such practice 
lay in failure of highlighting the key projects which in turn 
led to fewer number of researchers who took up such projects. 
  The Vice President of the academy, Mr. Ru Xin, said that 
there were some 460 treatises last year as the result of 
research on specific topics, together with 530 investigative 
reports, 2,500 academic papers not including translated and 
academic references. All these totalled 150 million Chinese 
characters. Mr. Ru frankly acknowledged that the success in 
terms of quantity was rather great but there were not many of 
high quality while most of them were of general level and some 
even were of low quality. 
  The bureau made public some guidelines for the bidding which 
covers 12 research projects including research on situation of 
and solution to state-owned enterprises which are in serious 
loss, research on loss of state-owned asset seen in the 
transaction of property rights of state-owned enterprises, 
research on division of revenue and expenditure by governments 
at various levels and a shift of revenue between governments, 
legal protection on the build-up of clean administration, policy 
on absorption of surplus of rural labour force in main urban 
areas and research on relationships between China and Japan as 
well as the United States in economic cooperation in Asia and 
Pacific region. 
  The 12 items make up one seventh of key projects set by the 
academy for the entire year. The period of time for such 
bidding was between May 10 and June 30 which is open to all 
researchers of the academy on a basis of fair competition and 
the most suitable candidates will be chosen. The academy 
specially appropriated RMB [renminbi] 680 000 to fund the 
research items under the bidding. Mr. He said that in order to 
ensure high level outcome from these projects, the academy 
suggested to carry out joint research on these items and 
organized research teams featuring various disciplines and 
institutes as well as experts and scholars.

<F P=106> ["Text of White Paper: `Intellectual Property Protection in </F>
China'"] 
  [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- The information office 
of China's State Council released a white paper entitled 
"Intellectual Property Protection in China" here today. The 
full text of the white paper follows: 
<H5>  Foreword </H5>
  Chinese civilization has a long history. The Chinese nation 
has a vast reservoir of creativity. The brilliant culture 
created by the Chinese people has exerted a deepgoing influence 
on the progress of human civilization. Over the past several 
thousand years, vast numbers of outstanding Chinese scientists, 
inventors, writers and artists have given the glorious fruits of 
their mental labour to the development of humanity's common 
civilization, making enormous contributions. 
  The intellectual property protection system emerged as a 
product of the development of human civilization and commodity 
economy and, in various countries, it has increasingly become an 
effective legal tool for protecting the interests of the owner 
of intellectual products, promoting the development of science, 
technology and the social economy, and allowing international 
competition. As a whole, China, however, for a variety of 
historical reasons, began work on its intellectual property 
rights protection system at a comparatively late date. After 
China started reform and opening to the outside world, it 
accelerated the process of establishing an intellectual property 
rights protection system in order to rapidly develop social 
productive forces, promote overall social progress, meet the 
needs of developing a socialist market economy and expedite 
China's entry into the world economy. Since the end of the 
1970s, China has done a tremendous amount of effective work in 
this field, covering in a little more than a dozen years a 
distance which took other developed countries scores of years, 
even a hundred years, establishing a relatively comprehensive 
legal system for the protection of intellectual property rights, 
thereby attracting worldwide attention for its achievements not 
only in establishing the system but also in enforcement. 
  Today, intellectual property protection is an issue of 
universal concern in the international political, economic, 
scientific, technological and cultural exchanges. International 
bilateral and multilateral negotiations on this topic, 
especially the reaching of the Agreement on Trade-Related 
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights in the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), have raised worldwide intellectual 
property protection to a new level. 
  In today's world, great importance is attached to 
intellectual property protection. What is China's specific 
position regarding this question? What is China's current 
legislation on intellectual property rights and how is it 
enforced? What measures has China taken to ensure its 
international commitment to intellectual property protection? A 
brief introduction to these issues will prove useful. 
  I. China's Basic Position Regarding the Protection 
of Intellectual Property Rights 
  It is the Chinese Government's view that the intellectual 
property protection system plays a significant role in promoting 
progress in science and technology, enriching culture and 
developing the economy. It functions both as an important 
institution ensuring the normal running of the socialist market 
economy and as one of the basic environments and conditions for 
conducting international exchange and cooperation in science, 
technology, economy and culture. China considers the protection 
of intellectual property an important part of its policy of 
reform and opening to the outside world and of the building of 
its socialist legal system. Beginning in the late 1970s, China 
has been formulating laws and regulations for intellectual 
property rights protection, and has been participating in 
activities organized by the relevant international organizations 
aimed at strengthening international exchange and cooperation in 
the field of intellectual property rights. From its inception 
China's intellectual property rights protection system was 
directed towards the world and geared to high international 
standards. Spurred on by its reform and opening up, China has 
carried on its intellectual property protection legislation at a 
speed never before known. 
  On March 3, 1980, the Chinese Government submitted its 
application for admission to the World Intellectual Property 
Organization, and became a member state as of June 3, 1980. 
  The Trademark Law of the People's Republic of China was 
adopted at the 24th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 
Fifth National People's Congress on August 23, 1982, effective 
March 1, 1983, significantly marking the beginning of the 
systematic establishment of China's modern legal system for the 
protection of intellectual property rights. 
  On March 12, 1984 the fourth meeting of the Standing 
Committee of the Sixth National People's Congress adopted the 
Patent Law of the People's Republic of China, effective April 1, 
1985. 
  On December 19, 1984, the Chinese Government submitted its 
instrument of accession to the Paris Convention for the 
Protection of Industrial Property to the World Intellectual 
Property Organization and became a member state as of March 19, 
1985. 
  The General Principles of the Civil Law of the People's 
Republic of China were adopted at the fourth session of the 
Sixth National People's Congress on April 12, 1986, effective 
January 1, 1987. In this legislation, intellectual property 
rights as a whole were clearly defined in China's basic civil 
law for the first time as the civil rights of citizens and legal 
persons. This law for the first time affirmed citizens' and 
legal persons' right of authorship (copyright). 
  The Chinese Government has also worked hard in helping to 
build up an international environment wherein intellectual 
property rights in integrated circuits are protected. The World 
Intellectual Property Organization adopted the Treaty on 
Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuit at a 
diplomatic conference held in Washington D.C. in 1989; China was 
among the first signatory states. 
  The Chinese Government presented its instrument of accession 
to the Madrid Agreement for the International Registration of 
Trademarks to the World Intellectual Property Organization on 
July 4, 1989, and became a member state as of October 4, 1989. 
  The Copyright Law of the People's Republic of China was 
adopted by the 15th meeting of the Seventh National People's 
Congress Standing Committee on September 7, 1990, effective June 
1, 1991. 
  On July 10, 1992, the Chinese Government presented its 
instrument of accession to the Berne Convention for the 
Protection of Literary and Artistic Works to the World 
Intellectual Property Organization and on July 30, 1992 its 
instrument of accession to the Universal Copyright Convention to 
UNESCO, becoming a member state of both conventions as of 
October 15 and October 30, 1992 respectively. 
  On January 4, 1993, the Chinese Government presented its 
instrument of accession to the Convention for the Protection of 
Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized Duplication of 
Their Phonograms to the World Intellectual Property 
Organization, and became a member state as of April 30, 1993. 
  The Law of the People's Republic of China on Combating 
Unfair 
Competition was adopted by the third meeting of the Standing 
Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress on September 
2, 1993, and became effective on December 1 of the same year. 
  On September 15, 1993, the Chinese Government submitted its 
instrument of accession to the Patent Cooperation Treaty to the 
World Intellectual Property Organization, becoming a member 
state as of January 1, 1994. The Patent Office of China is 
China's agency dealing with cases involving the Patent 
Cooperation Treaty, performing international patent searches and 
preliminary examinations. 
  The above are only part of the records of China's 
intellectual property legislation and its participation in the 
activities organized by related international organizations, 
demonstrating the importance China has attached to intellectual 
property protection. 
  The basic framework for China's intellectual property rights 
protection legal system was completed for the most part in the 
1980s. In the 1990s, international economic relations and the 
international economic environment have already undergone great 
changes. In November 1990, multilateral trade negotiations in 
GATT's Uruguay Round produced a draft Agreement on Trade-Related 
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. This signaled that a 
new international standard of intellectual property rights 
protection was taking form. The Chinese Government actively 
participated in the negotiations and made unremitting efforts 
towards their final success. In order to meet the needs of the 
ever-wider opening up, China has consciously sought to fulfil 
its international obligation in intellectual property rights 
protection, endeavoring to bring its intellectual property 
protection level near the new international standards, and has 
taken many major measures to further raise its current level of 
intellectual property rights protection. 
  The Chinese Government's sincerity in its efforts to 
scrupulously abide by international conventions and bilateral 
agreements regarding the protection of intellectual property 
rights, and its capacity to fully implement its international 
obligations have been appreciated and supported by world 
opinion. When reviewing the World Intellectual Property 
Organization's past 20 years of cooperation with China, Dr. 
Arpad Bogsch, Director-General of the Organization, pointed out 
that "China had accomplished all this at a speed unmatched in 
the history of intellectual property protection." 
  China adheres to the principle in legal system that "there 
shall be laws to abide by, everyone should abide by the law, the 
law must be enforced strictly, and those who violate the law 
must be dealt with." Still, the intellectual property rights 
protection system has only comparatively recently been 
introduced in China, and some portion of the population has a 
rather incomplete understanding of intellectual property rights. 
In order to better implement this principle, while improving 
its legal system, enforcing the laws earnestly and striking 
relentless blows at infringements and other unlawful practices, 
China has spared no efforts in publicizing and providing 
education about the intellectual property protection legal 
system and in accelerating the training of professional 
personnel in this field. In China the promulgation of every 
intellectual property law was followed by widespread publicity 
through the media and distribution of large quantities of 
educational video-tapes and separate editions of the law. 
Meanwhile, governments at all levels ran legal knowledge forums 
and training classes so as to promptly make the relevant law 
known to all the people. After the revision of the Patent Law, 
for instance, millions of people throughout China attended such 
classes, the attendance in Hunan Province alone reaching 600,000 
people. The fact that there has been an increasing number of 
cases involving intellectual property rights in recent years and 
that these cases have been remedied through recourse to law 
reflects the people's heightened awareness and the wide spread 
of intellectual property rights knowledge throughout society. 
In order to speed up the training of personnel in this field, 
the Chinese government has, in close cooperation with related 
international organizations, sent people abroad to study or to 
attend training classes and seminars. Together with the World 
Intellectual Property Organization, China has held more than 30 
training classes and seminars, with the attendance of over 3,000 
people. Programs in intellectual property rights education and 
research have also been initiated at over 70 institutions of 
higher learning throughout the country. In 1986, a teaching and 
research centre for intellectual property rights was established 
at the People's University of China, enrolling non-law majors to 
study for a second degree in intellectual property rights; 
Beijing University's School of Intellectual Property Rights was 
founded in 1993 on the basis of the achievements it had attained 
in teaching and research in this regard. An education system 
for training professional personnel in this field for their 
second, Master's or Doctor's degrees has gradually taken form in 
China, providing the nation with batch after batch of qualified 
personnel in intellectual property rights protection. 
  II. China Has a High-Grade Legal System for 
Intellectual Property Protection 
  Along with its progress in reform and opening up, China has 
made big strides in intellectual property protection. In 
accordance with its national conditions and current tendencies 
in international development, China has formulated and 
fine-tuned various laws and regulations on intellectual property 
protection, thereby constructing a socialist legal system for 
intellectual property protection with Chinese characteristics. 
The scope of the intellectual property rights protected in 
China and the degree of protection afforded have gradually 
conformed with international practices and the high degree of 
legal protection for intellectual property rights has been 
realized. 
  Effective as of March 1983, the Trademark Law of the 
People's 
Republic of China and the rules for its implementation set forth 
the principles of application, examination and registration in 
trademark registration procedures which are entirely identical 
with common international principles. In order to meet the 
requirements of the reform and opening up and of economic 
development, to more effectively crack down on trademark 
counterfeiting and stop acts of infringement, and to 
conscientiously protect the right to exclusive use of a 
registered trademark, in 1993 China revised both its Trademark 
Law and the rules for its implementation to expand the range of 
trademarks protected. Regulations on commodity trademarks were 
joined by regulations on the registration and management of 
service trademarks; in examination as to form, a revision 
procedure was added, and in examination as to substance, a 
written comment system was established to provide convenience 
for registered trademark applicants. All these regulations 
coincide completely with the requirements of GATT's Agreement on 
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. In 
addition, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce has 
issued a series of regulations including the Regulations on the 
Administration of the Printing of Trademarks and the Procedures 
for Filing License Contracts for the Use of Trademarks. In 
February 1993, the National People's Congress Standing Committee 
adopted the Supplementary Regulations on Punishing Criminal 
Counterfeiting of Registered Trademarks to further intensify 
punishment for such counterfeiting and other infringements. 
These laws and regulations fully and effectively guarantee the 
right to the exclusive use of Chinese and foreign registered 
trademarks. 
  The Patent Law of the People's Republic of China and the 
rules for its implementation came into effect in April 1985, 
expanding the scope of intellectual property protection in China 
to include inventions and other new creations. In order to 
bring the level of China's patent protection closer to 
international standards, the Standing Committee of the National 
People's Congress adopted an amendment to the Patent Law on 
September 4, 1992, which included important revisions. 
Proceeding from the needs of expanding the opening up and 
accelerating scientific, technological and economic development, 
first, the revised Patent Law expands the scope of patent 
protection: patents may be granted to all types of 
technological inventions, whether new products or new 
techniques, including pharmaceutical products and substances 
obtained by means of a chemical process, foods, beverages and 
flavorings. Second, an invention patent's duration has been 
extended from 15 years from the date of application to 20 years; 
the duration of utility model patents and of exterior design 
patents has been extended from 5 years from the date of 
application to 10 years. Third, the protection of patent rights 
has been further strengthened. In addition to extending the 
protection of a patented process to include products directly 
produced by that process, the law clearly stipulates that the 
importation of patented products requires the permission of the 
patent holder, thereby giving more effective protection to the 
rights and interests of patentees. Fourth, conditions for 
imposing compulsory patent license were restipulated. These 
measures mark the reaching of a new level of patent protection 
in China. In this way, the Patent Law of China has essentially 
been brought in line with the GATT Agreement on Trade-Related 
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. 
  The Copyright Law of the People's Republic of China and the 
rules for its implementation explicitly protect the copyright 
and other legitimate rights and interests of the authors of 
literary, artistic and scientific works. The law provides that 
in addition to protecting the copyright of written works, oral 
works, music, operas, quyi (folk art forms including ballad 
singing, story telling, comic dialogues, clapper talks, cross 
talks, etc), choreography, works of fine arts, photographs, 
films, TV programs, video tapes, engineering designs, product 
designs and their descriptions, maps, sketch maps and other 
graphic works, China also protects computer software. China is 
among a select group of countries that have explicitly listed 
computer software as the object of protection by copyright laws. 
The State Council has, moreover, promulgated the Regulations on 
the Protection of Computer Software, providing the specifics 
whereby the laws protecting computer software will be 
implemented. These regulations, a necessary adjunct to the 
Copyright Law, came into effect in October 1991. On September 
25, 1992 the State Council promulgated the Regulations on the 
Implementation of the International Copyright Treaty, providing 
specific regulations on protecting foreign authors' copyrights 
in accordance with the international treaty. 
  These laws and regulations have been joined by the 
Technological Contract Law of the People's Republic of China and 
the Law on Scientific and Technological Progress of the People's 
Republic of China as formulated by the Standing Committee of the 
National People's Congress, as well as a series of 
administrative regulations concerning intellectual property 
protection worked out by the State Council, together further 
optimizing the nation's legal system for the protection of 
intellectual property rights, in the whole bringing the system 
close to and in coordination with international levels of 
protection. 
  China has a complete legal system for the protection of 
intellectual property rights. China's intellectual property law 
stipulates the legal responsibilities to be borne by anyone who 
violates the law, including civil liability, criminal liability 
and exposure to administrative sanctions. 
  China's Patent Law provides that in the case of infringement 
arising from the exploitation of a patent without authorization 
of the patentee, the patentee or other affected parties may 
request the patent administrative authorities to deal with the 
matter or may directly file suit in a people's court. In 
investigating and dealing with the matter, the patent 
administrative authorities are empowered to order the infringer 
to stop all acts of infringement and compensate for any losses. 
Whoever counterfeits a patented product or wrongly appropriates 
a patented technique will be ordered by the patent 
administrative authorities to cease all acts of counterfeiting, 
to provide the public with notification of his or her violation, 
and to pay a fine. In the case of serious violations, the 
criminal liability of the person directly responsible shall be 
investigated through application of relevant articles of the 
Criminal Law, and if found guilty, the person directly 
responsible shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not 
more than three years, criminal detention or a fine. 
  China's trademark laws and regulations stipulate that in the 
event of infringement on the right to exclusive use of a 
registered trademark, the administrative department for industry 
and commerce can, in line with its functions and powers or on 
the basis of a consumer complaint, examine and deal with the 
violation on its own initiative. The party whose right has been 
infringed may also, at the place where the infringer lives or 
where the act of infringement took place, request an 
administrative department for industry and commerce at or above 
the county level to handle the matter. The relevant 
administrative department for industry and commerce has the 
right to order the infringer to immediately cease infringement 
and to compensate the party whose right has been infringed for 
its losses. If the act of infringement on the right to 
exclusive use of a registered trademark does not constitute a 
crime, the administrative department for industry and commerce 
may still impose a fine on the infringer. If the party 
concerned wishes to challenge the decision of the administrative 
department for industry and commerce, it may bring suit in a 
people's court within a fixed time and the court will render 
judgment on the case. These regulations provide convenience to 
the litigants, and, moreover, ensure consistency, impartiality 
and seriousness in administrative law enforcement and judicial 
adjudication. In the event of an infringement on the right to 
exclusive use of a registered trademark, the party whose right 
has been infringed may also directly bring suit in a people's 
court. If the counterfeiting of registered trademarks 
constitutes a crime, the person who committed the act shall be 
ordered to compensate the party whose right has been infringed 
for losses suffered and his criminal responsibility shall be 
investigated and dealt with in accordance with the law. In 
accordance with the Supplementary Regulations on Punishing 
Criminal Counterfeiting of Registered Trademarks, in cases where 
the illegal gains are relatively large or other serious 
circumstances are involved the counterfeiter of a registered 
trademark will be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not 
more than three years or criminal detention, and/or fined; if 
the illegal gains are very large the counterfeiter shall be 
sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three 
years and not more than seven years and be fined. If an 
enterprise or institution is guilty of criminally counterfeiting 
a registered trademark, the unit will be fined and the criminal 
liability of the person in charge and other people directly 
responsible for the counterfeiting shall be investigated and 
dealt with in accordance with the law. If a government employee 
knowingly covers up the criminal counterfeiting of a registered 
trademark or if a person charged with enforcing the law 
compromises the law for personal gain, his or her criminal 
malfeasance will be determined by law. 
  The Copyright Law of China provides that the following 
acts shall be regarded as infringement: publication of a 
copyright owner's work without his or her permission, and the 
unauthorized publication of a cooperative work as the work of a 
single author; claiming authorship of another person's work 
without taking part in its creation with the intention of 
gaining fame or profit; distortion or alteration of another 
person's works; exploitation of an author's work in any manner 
without prior permission; the use of another's work without 
providing the legally stipulated payment; and live broadcast of 
a performance without the performer's prior permission. In such 
cases, the infringer shall bear civil responsibility for the 
cessation of the infringement, for the elimination of any 
negative effects caused by his actions, for offering a public 
apology, and for compensation for any losses. Those who 
plagiarize other people's works, or reproduce and distribute 
another person's works for their personal benefit without the 
copyright holder's permission, those who publish a book without 
the permission of the owner of the publishing right, and those 
who duplicate and distribute video and audio tapes without 
getting the permission of the tape manufacturers bear civil 
responsibility for their actions. The copyright administrative 
authorities may confiscate their illegal income or impose a fine 
on them. In the case of a copyright infringement or of 
violation of other related interests, the party whose rights 
have been infringed may also directly bring suit in a people's 
court. With regard to illegal activities that gravely 
jeopardize the social order or seriously infringe on the 
legitimate rights and interests of a copyright holder or the 
holder of other intellectual property rights, in cases where 
such violations constitute a crime the criminal liability of the 
infringer shall be investigated and dealt with in accordance 
with the relevant laws. 
  With the implementation of intellectual property laws, 
intellectual property rights are effectively protected in China. 
These laws are also actively encouraging invention and other 
forms of creation and fair competition. For instance, the 
protection of the right to the exclusive use of registered 
trademarks has resulted in the rapid growth of the number of 
trademarks registered by Chinese and foreign businessmen in 
China. By the end of 1993, the number of effective registered 
trademarks had exceeded 410,000. Of these, 350,000 were 
domestic, with the remaining 60,000 coming from 67 countries and 
regions. Companies from the United States, for example, had 
only 122 trademarks registered in China before 1979; by 1993 
that number had soared to 16,221, more than a hundred times the 
earlier figure. In 1993, there were 170,000 applications for 
trademark registration annually in China, including more than 
130,000 applications for new trademarks registration, among the 
highest number in the world. In addition, the Patent Law of 
China has greatly encouraged inventions and other creations in 
China, and has proved a magnet to patent applications from other 
countries and regions. On April 1, 1985, the first day the 
Patent Law came into effect, 3,455 applications for patent 
rights were submitted. By the end of 1993, the Patent Office of 
China had handled over 360,000 applications for patent rights. 
Of those, 27.5 percent were for inventions, 62.8 percent for 
utility models, and 9.7 percent for exterior designs; domestic 
applications accounted for 86.4 percent, while 13.6 percent were 
applications from 70 countries and regions. By the end of 1993, 
175,000 patents had been approved, including more than 20,000 
invention patents, more than 130,000 utility model patents and 
over 20,000 exterior design patents. 
  III. China Has a Complete Law Enforcement System 
for Intellectual Property Protection 
  China has formulated comprehensive intellectual property 
rights laws and regulations. Today, it is earnest and fair in 
executing these laws, and much has been accomplished in this 
regard. 
  These great achievements in the execution of the 
intellectual 
property rights protection laws and regulations are above all 
the product of comprehensive judicature and administration 
provided for in these same laws and regulations. 
  1. China's judicial institutions for intellectual property 
protection. 
  In China, any citizen, legal person or organization entitled 
to intellectual property rights whose rights and interests have 
been infringed may bring a lawsuit to the people's court in 
accordance with the law and receive practical and effective 
judicial protection. 
  The people's courts exercise judicial power independently 
according to law, are subordinate only to the law itself, and 
are not subject to interference by any administrative organ, 
public organization or individual. 
  Earnest execution of the law is the core of the 
administration of justice. The judicial activities of a 
people's court are carried out on the basis of facts, and with 
the law providing the criterion. Cases are tried strictly in 
accordance with substantive and procedural laws. Cases are 
heard in an open court, and a collegial system, a challenge 
system, a system whereby the court of second instance is the 
court of last instance, and a trial supervision system are 
practised. Judicial work, in accordance with the law, is also 
subject to supervision by people's congresses and people's 
procuratorates at all levels and by the masses, so as to ensure 
openness, impartiality, and seriousness. 
  The establishment and fortification of the judicial organs 
for trying intellectual property rights cases and the 
optimization of the judicial system are important guarantees for 
the people's courts correctly to handle such cases and 
conscientiously to protect intellectual property rights 
according to law. In recognition of the specialized nature of 
intellectual property rights cases and the advanced nature of 
the technology often involved, the higher people's courts in 
several provinces and municipalities directly under the central 
government such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Fujian and 
Hainan have since 1992 established such intellectual property 
rights courts as their actual needs demand. The intermediate 
people's courts in all the special economic zones as well as 
Beijing and Shanghai have also established intellectual property 
rights courts. Intermediate people's courts in the capital 
cities of other provinces and autonomous regions and in 
municipalities have set up collegial panels specializing in 
cases involving intellectual property rights protection. In 
this manner the hearing of intellectual property rights cases is 
centralized with the advantageous results that unity in 
executing the law is ensured, experience in dealing with the law 
is amassed, and the quality of judicature in intellectual 
property rights cases is strengthened. 
  With the implementation of China's law on intellectual 
property protection and the increasing improvement of the 
judiciary's protective power, people's courts at various levels 
in China have accepted and decided a large number of civil 
disputes concerning intellectual property rights. A total of 
3,505 cases concerning intellectual property rights disputes 
were accepted and handled by people's courts throughout the 
country from 1986 to the end of 1993, 1,168 of which concerned 
copyrights, 1,783 patents, and 554 trademark rights. The 
people's courts in accordance with the law defend the legitimate 
rights and interests of the foreign and domestic intellectual 
property rights holders through trying cases concerning 
intellectual property rights disputes. For example, the 
inventor of a new "technique for sinking piling using drill 
holes," brought a suit against the Beijing Subway Foundation 
Engineering Company to determine ownership of the patent on the 
invention. After trying the case, the Beijing Higher People's 
Court held that this invention was not a service invention as 
described by the Patent Law, so the patent right belonged to the 
inventor and not to his employer. In another example, Hong 
Kong's Sendon International Co., Ltd. brought suit against 
Shenzhen's Huada Electronics Co., Ltd. For trademark 
infringement. After hearing the case, the Shenzhen Intermediate 
People's Court ruled that the trademark "SENDON" was registered 
in China mainland by the plaintiff and should be protected by 
law. The defendant's use of the trademark "SENDON" on the same 
commodity sold by the plaintiff under that name constituted 
infringement on the rights to exclusive use of a registered 
trademark. The court decided that the defendant should pay the 
plaintiff 468,314.4 yuan in compensation. 
  Intellectual property rights are important civil rights. 
In civil infringement cases, the people's court is empowered to 
order the infringer to bear civil responsibility for the 
cessation of the infringement, for the elimination of any 
negative effects caused by his actions, for offering apologies, 
and for compensation for any losses in accordance with the law. 
Furthermore, it is empowered to confiscate the infringer's 
illegal gains and/or adjudge the infringer to criminal detention 
or a fine. 
  If the infringement of intellectual property rights is so 
serious that it has disrupted the economic order and constitutes 
a crime, the infringer's criminal responsibility is investigated 
and dealt with according to law. When a people's procuratorate 
institutes prosecution for a criminal act of infringement, if 
the evidence is sufficient to prove that the defendant has 
counterfeited another's trademark or patent right and the case 
is so serious as to constitute a crime, the people's court shall 
promptly and precisely impose punishment in strict accordance 
with the law. Between 1992 and 1993, people's courts accepted 
743 criminal cases for counterfeiting trademarks, of which 731 
have been tried with 566 people being sentenced to fixed terms 
of imprisonment, criminal detention or other punishments. The 
People's Court of Zhongshan City in Guangdong Province in 
separate cases imposed fines on five persons directly 
responsible for counterfeiting the American Mobil Oil 
Corporation's trademark "MOBIL," further sentencing the 
defendants to fixed terms of imprisonment from one year to two 
and a half years. This amply demonstrates that the people's 
courts of China are resolute in their stand towards punishing 
criminals and safeguarding intellectual property rights. 
  According to China's Administrative Procedure Law, if a 
citizen, legal person or organization wishes to contest a 
judgement or order of an administrative department for 
intellectual property protection in a dispute concerning 
intellectual property rights and to initiate administrative 
procedure litigation, the people's court shall try the case and 
shall, in accordance with the law, make a decision to maintain, 
rescind, or alter it. 
  When a people's court tries a case arising from intellectual 
property rights involving foreign nationals, it acts in 
accordance with Chinese laws and relevant international 
conventions to which China is a party, adhering to the principle 
of equity and reciprocity. In this way, the court provides the 
solid legal guarantees necessary for expanding international 
economic, technological and cultural exchange and cooperation. 
The Shenzhen Intermediate People's Court accepted the American 
E.F. Houghton Company's suit against the Shenzhen Hailian 
Chemical Co., Ltd. for the latter's trademark violations. 
Investigation proved the defendant's infringement and held it 
responsible. The two parties negotiated a settlement through 
mediation. The defendant promptly stopped its acts of 
infringement, offered public apology to the plaintiff, and 
handed over 130,000 yuan as a compensation for the plaintiff's 
economic loss. The court, in addition, adjudged the defendant a 
civil sanction fine. Ten days passed from the court's 
acceptance of the case to its resolution, expeditious remedy 
much appreciated by the American plaintiff. In acknowledgement 
of this, the E.F. Houghton Company presented the court with a 
silk banner reading: "Chinese law is just; judges try cases 
expeditiously." 
  Over the past few years, in an effort to raise the level of 
the administration of justice, the people's courts have adopted 
a series of potent measures to improve their quality and 
efficiency in handling cases. In order to amplify their impact, 
the people's courts have selected typical cases and tried them 
publicly, conducting information campaigns through the various 
public media. Undeniable social effects have been achieved 
through the use of specific cases in the popularization of legal 
education and the dignity of the socialist legal system has been 
maintained. 
  2. Administrative channels for intellectual property 
protection in China. 
  In addition to judicature in accordance with international 
practices, China's system for the protection of intellectual 
property rights comprises the Patent Law, the Trademark Law, and 
the Copyright Law and other administrative channels designated 
in intellectual property laws, all proceeding from China's 
actual conditions. 
  Under the Patent Law, the competent authorities in the State 
Council and local people's governments have the right to 
establish patent offices. Today, China has more than 50 patent 
offices established by local governments and more than 20 patent 
offices established by various ministries and departments under 
the State Council. The State Copyright Administration and local 
copyright administrative organs have been established in 
accordance with the Copyright Law. Trademark administration 
calls for unified registration of trademarks by the central 
government and level-by-level administration by the various 
local governments. Trademark administrative departments under 
the administrative bureaus for industry and commerce have been 
established at the central, provincial, city, prefectural and 
county levels; below the county level, there are administrative 
offices for industry and commerce. Today, there are well over 
7,000 full-time trademark administration personnel throughout 
China, in addition to 300,000 part-time personnel. 
  Chinese intellectual property rights administrative 
departments exercise their legally stipulated powers and 
functions to safeguard law and order within the field of 
intellectual property, encourage fair competition, mediate 
disputes, settle cases involving violations of intellectual 
property rights, and protect the interests of the broad masses 
of the people by maintaining a good social and economic 
environment. 
  In China the administrative procedures for solving disputes 
concerning intellectual property rights are simple and 
convenient. Cases can be quickly filed for official examination 
and possible prosecution, investigation follows promptly, and 
efficiency in handling the case is high. This is advantageous 
to the owners of the rights. The patent administrative organs 
in China always treat patent violation claims seriously and deal 
with them without delay in accordance with the law. 
  Since the Copyright Law was put into force, local 
administrative organs responsible for copyright affairs 
investigated and dealt with more than 150 cases involving 
pirated books and video products from June 1991 to the end of 
1993. They have confiscated and destroyed the pirated goods and 
levied administrative sanctions on the infringers. In 1994, the 
Chinese Government has organized the departments concerned to 
launch an assault, investigating and dealing with the illegal 
duplication of laser discs and illegal reproduction of books. 
In April 1994 in Guangdong Province, the administrative 
departments in charge of copyrights, cultural affairs, 
broadcast, film and video-tapes, the administrative departments 
for industry and commerce, and public security departments took 
joint action to deal with the illegal duplication of laser 
discs. Subsequently, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Hunan also took 
actions to deal with these problems. These measures dealt a 
heavy blow to the production and selling of pirated products. 
Over this same period, relevant departments of the Chinese 
Government took steps to strengthen administration over the 
establishment of enterprises manufacturing compact discs and 
supervision over their production in accordance with the law. 
  The Trademark Law of China has been in effect for more 
than ten years. During this time, the administrative 
departments for industry and commerce have dealt with 130,000 
cases of trademark violation and counterfeiting, including a 
number of particularly serious cases, e.g. Trademark violations 
or counterfeited trademarks for "Zhonghua" cigarettes, for 
"Forever," "Phoenix" and "Flying Pigeon" bicycles, for "Guizhou 
Maotai" wine, and for "Xingkaihe" ginseng. Effective protection 
was thus given to the lawful rights and interests of the 
registered trademark owners. 
  China's intellectual property rights administrative organs, 
in accordance with Chinese laws and relevant international 
treaties to which China is a party, adhering to the principle of 
equal treatment for nationals and non-nationals and reciprocity, 
give protection to foreigners' intellectual property rights in 
accordance with the law. For instance, the Zhejiang Provincial 
Patent Administration Office recently reached a just settlement 
in a complaint brought by a foreign plaintiff concerning 
unlicensed production of a cigarette lighter to which he held 
patent. The competent authorities ordered the factory concerned 
to cease all acts of infringement and compensate the foreigner 
for his losses. The State Copyright Administration investigated 
and then dealt with a series of cases in which a dozen odd arts 
and crafts factories in Fujian and Guangdong had manufactured 
pirated toys copying several foreign companies' toy designs, and 
a case in which an electronics enterprise in Jiangsu was 
illegally producing compact discs. Administrative departments 
for industry and commerce have investigated and dealt with 3,000 
cases involving the counterfeiting and other violations of such 
foreign trademarks as TDK, Toshiba, Sony, IBM, 3M, ESSO, P&amp;G, 
Head &amp; Shoulders, Xiaotiancai, and Philips. 
  A large proportion of the cases concerning violations of 
foreigners' intellectual property rights were investigated and 
dealt with by China's intellectual property protection 
administrative offices on their own initiative, acting in 
accordance with their prescribed functions and powers. 
  China's administrative departments for industry and commerce 
have undertaken the responsibility of maintaining economic order 
and can make market investigations on their own initiative so as 
to effectively protect the rights of the registered trademark 
owners. Since 1988, administrative organs for industry and 
commerce at various levels in Guangdong Province have 
investigated and dealt with 30l cases concerning the violation 
of U.S.-owned trademarks. Out of these 301 cases, one third were 
filed by the American trademark owners, with the remaining cases 
being the product of market investigations by the administrative 
organs for industry and commerce or consumer complaints. 
China's intellectual property rights administrative offices are 
impartial, and firmly safeguard the lawful rights and interests 
of those who hold such rights. This has earned them praises 
from many foreign enterprises and joint ventures. Some of these 
companies presented the administrative departments for industry 
and commerce silk banners or gilt boards, bearing words of 
praise such as "upright and honest, firm as a rock in 
administering justice," "impartiality in enforcing the law, 
support right, eliminate wrong," "just settlement, protection of 
commerce," "strict and impartial justice, conqueror of fakes and 
frauds," and "strict and impartial in executing the law, 
consummate impartiality." They praised the personnel handling 
the cases as "conscientious in work and resolute in action," 
"such speed in handling a case is seldom encountered anywhere in 
the world," etc. 
  Concluding Remarks 
  As China implements its reform and opening to the outside 
world, it is changing with each passing day. Today more than a 
few international observers have come to the conclusion that in 
terms of intellectual property protection China has reached 
international advanced levels. China's backwardness in its 
intellectual property system is now a thing of the past. 
  However, there remain some naysayers in the world seemingly 
willfully blind to China's development and transformation who 
incognizant of present realities pass improper judgements on the 
nation's current situation regarding intellectual property 
protection. They allege that China has not yet established a 
"full and effective intellectual property system," and that 
China "lacks the ability to undertake international 
obligations." Such unfounded opinions do not bear argument; the 
truth speaks for itself. 
  Nonetheless, China cannot remain satisfied with the 
achievements it has already made. China is a developing country 
and still has much work towards optimizing its intellectual 
property system. This system in its modern form was established 
only a short time ago, and as a result, awareness of 
intellectual property rights remains underdeveloped in society 
at large. In some regions and in some governmental departments 
there is insufficient appreciation of the importance of 
intellectual property protection. Some serious acts of 
infringement have violated not only the legitimate rights and 
interests of the holder of the intellectual property right, but 
also the dignity of the law. Accordingly, even as the nation 
continues to otherwise improve the intellectual property legal 
system, the State Council has drawn up Decisions on Further 
Strengthening the Protection of Intellectual Property. China is 
confident that the implementation of all the important measures 
contained in the Decisions will mark a great new step forward in 
the nation's efforts to ensure the protection of intellectual 
property rights. 
  China will continue actively to promote international 
cooperation in the field of intellectual property. China itself 
has received active assistance from the World Intellectual 
Property Organization and from others working in the field in 
establishing and fine-tuning its intellectual property rights 
protection system. The nation will, as in the past, actively 
join in the activities of relevant international organizations 
and fulfil the obligations described in the international 
intellectual property treaties and agreements. Operating on the 
basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and in 
accordance with the principle of equality and mutual benefit, 
China will continue to cooperate with the rest of the world's 
nations, working and making positive contributions towards the 
development and optimization of the international intellectual 
property system.

  [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- China has attached 
great importance to intellectual property protection and will 
spare no efforts in further raising its current level of 
intellectual property protection, according to a white paper 
issued by the Information Office of the State Council here today. 
  The white paper says, the Chinese Government holds that the 
intellectual property protection system plays a significant role 
in promoting progress in science and technology, enriching 
culture and developing the economy. 
  It functions both as an important institution ensuring the 
normal running of the socialist market economy and as one of the 
basic environments and conditions for conducting international 
exchange and cooperation in science, technology, economy and 
culture. 
  China considers the protection of intellectual property an 
important part of its policy of reform and opening to the 
outside world and of the building of its socialist legal system. 
  Beginning in the late 1970s, China has been formulating laws 
and regulations for intellectual property rights [IPR] 
protection, and has been participating in activities organized 
by the relevant international organizations aimed at 
strengthening international exchange and cooperation in the 
field of intellectual property rights. 
  From its inception, China's intellectual property rights 
protection system was directed towards the world and geared to 
high international standards. 
  Spurred on by its reform and opening up, China has carried 
on 
its intellectual property protection legislation at a speed 
never before known. 
  The white paper points out that since China joined the world 
intellectual property organization in June, 1980, it has gained 
accession to a number of international intellectual property 
right protection pacts, including the Paris Convention for the 
Protection of Industrial Property, the Treaty on Intellectual 
Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits, the Madrid Agreement 
for the International Registration of Trademarks, the Berne 
Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, 
the Universal Copyright Convention, the Convention for the 
Protection of Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized 
Duplication of Their Phonograms and the Patent Cooperation 
Treaty. 
  Meanwhile, China has adopted a series of laws and 
regulations 
in this regard which include the Trademark Law, the Patent Law, 
the Copyright Law and the Law on Combating Unfair Competition. 
  The basic framework for China's intellectual property rights 
protection legal system was completed for the most part in the 
1980s, says the white paper. In the 1990s, international 
economic relations and the international economic environment 
have already undergone great changes. In November, 1990, 
multilateral trade negotiation in GATT's Uruguay Round produced 
a draft agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual 
property rights. This signaled that a new international 
standard of intellectual property rights protection was taking 
form. 
  The Chinese Government actively participated in the 
negotiations and made unremitting efforts towards their final 
success. In order to meet the needs of the ever-wider opening 
up, China has consciously sought to fulfill its international 
obligation in intellectual property rights protection, 
endeavouring to bring its intellectual property protection level 
near the new international standards, and has taken many major 
measures to further raise its current level of intellectual 
property rights protection. 
  The Chinese Government's sincerity in its efforts to 
scrupulously abide by international conventions and bilateral 
agreements regarding the protection of intellectual property 
rights, its capacity to fully implement its international 
obligations have been appreciated and supported by world opinion. 
  The white paper notes that when reviewing the World 
Intellectual Property Organization's past 20 years of 
cooperation with China, Dr. Arpad Bogsch, director-general of 
the organization, pointed out that "China had accomplished all 
this at a speed unmatched in the history of intellectual 
property rights protection." 
  The white paper says that as the intellectual property 
rights 
protection system has only comparatively recently been 
introduced in China, and some portion of the population has a 
rather incomplete understanding of intellectual property rights, 
China has spared no efforts in publicizing and providing 
education about the intellectual property protection legal 
system and in accelerating the training of professional 
personnel in this field. In China the promulgation of every 
intellectual property law was followed by widespread publicity 
through the media and distribution of large quantities of 
educational video-tapes and separate editions of the law. 
  In order to speed up the training of personnel in this 
field, 
the Chinese Government has, in close cooperation with related 
international organizations, sent people abroad to study or to 
attend training classes and seminars. 
  Together with the world intellectual property organization, 
China has held more than 30 training classes and seminars, with 
the attendance of over 3,000 people. Programs in intellectual 
property rights education and research have also been initiated 
at over 70 institutions of higher learning throughout the 
country, the white paper says.

  [Text] Guangzhou, June 15 (CNS) -- A storm, unprecedented 
for a century, has hit north Guangdong for days, causing 
eruption of mountain torrents in the Liannan Yao Autonomous 
County and the Lianshan Zhuang Autonomous County, which has 
resulted in serious damage. 
  Since 12th this month transport, telecommunications and 
electricity in six townships of Liannan have been disrupted by 
mountain torrents triggered by days of heavy downpour. More 
than 40 power stations have been flooded or damaged. Production 
of most industrial enterprises and mines in the county seat and 
townships have to stop. The water level of the Bandong 
Reservoir, located, compared with others, on the highest place 
above sea-level in the province, is already 3.3 metres above the 
warning level. It is estimated that 1,300 people have been 
trapped in flood, over 300 houses have collapsed, 37 have died, 
one reported missing, 18 injured. About 1,000 hectares of crops 
have been submerged, causing the damage valued at more than RMB 
[renminbi] 100 million. 
  The storm also ravaged the county seat of Lianshan and over 
30 villages from 10th to 13th and caused eruption of mountain 
torrents. By the noon of yesterday, parts of riversides 
totalling 3 kilometres, ten bridges had been damaged. More than 
200 hectares of fish-raising ponds, over 1,000 hectares of crops 
were submerged. Tens of hundred people were trapped in flood. 
The direct economic loss caused by the storm is put at RMB 16 
million. 
  Qingyuan government officials and local cadres have been to 
the two counties to direct rescue work and trying to minimize 
the loss.

  [Text] Beijing, June 15 (CNS) -- Statistics released by 
the municipal Bureau of Land on the use of land in the 
municipality last year showed that occupation of land was rather 
serious here. 
  Each category of land use occupied a large area of land and 
the trend tended to go upwards. The total area of land occupied 
by each category was put at 5,743.8 hectares last year, 
registering the largest area in the last decade. Land occupied 
for nonagricultural categories made up 89 per cent while land 
for adjustment of farming pattern accounted for 11 per cent. 
  Arable land was seriously occupied. Various kinds of 
construction and adjustment of agricultural structure made up 
3937.4 hectares of cultivated land last year while exploitation 
of new cultivated land was put at 166.6 hectares, showing a net 
drop of 3,770.8 hectares for the entire year which was the most 
serious loss of arable land in the last ten years. Occupation 
of cultivated land by the state, the collective entities and 
individuals was rather serious, making up 84 per cent of the 
total. Construction of the state level made up 77.1 per cent of 
the arable land, the collective entities 6.2 per cent and 
individuals 0.6 per cent which was mainly for housing 
construction. As of late last year the total area under 
cultivation across the municipality was reduced to 385,000 
hectares. 
  Land under various kinds of construction in Beijing exceeded 
restrictions on each category set by the state for l993. 
Construction of the state level saw 266.7 hectares more than the 
planned, the collective level 466.7 hectares and individual 
level 333.3 hectares which was mainly for housing construction. 
  Beijing saw an increase of land cases in violation of law 
which involved a great area. There were 660 such cases covering 
a total area of 745 hectares and 557 hectares of cultivated 
land. Illegal occupation of arable land made up 74.8 per cent 
of the total area. Unauthorized use of land in such cases 
accounted for 625 hectares and took 449 hectares of cultivated 
land, dealing a serious blow to the economic construction and 
the general urban planning in Beijing.

<F P=106> [By Feng Xiuju (7458 4423 5468); Beijing XINHUA Domestic </F>
Service in Chinese at 1607 GMT on 15 June transmits a service 
message replacing the following item] 
  [Text] Beijing, 15 Jun (XINHUA) -- Meeting with his 
visitors from Hong Kong today, Li Ruihuan, member of the CPC 
Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee and 
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], said that much work 
remains to be done in implementing the "one country, two 
systems" principle and in maintaining Hong Kong's smooth 
transition and its stability and prosperity after 1997. 
  He said: "Just like accomplishing all other projects, we 
must strategically despise them but tactically take them 
seriously. So not only must we have the determination and 
confidence, but we must also have the capabilities and methods 
for accomplishing them." 
  Li Ruihuan made the statement this morning while meeting at 
the Great Hall of the People with the delegation of the Chinese 
Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong headed by its president 
Herbert Liang. 
  Li Ruihuan said: The "one country, two systems" principle 
was Deng Xiaoping's great creation which is in line with the 
interests of all Chinese people, including our countrymen in 
Hong Kong, and it has important and far-reaching significance. 
We will unswervingly implement this principle. 
  Li Ruihuan urged countrymen in Hong Kong to unite as closely 
as possible and contribute more to the process of achieving the 
goal that "Hong Kong is to be governed by Hong Kong citizens 
themselves." 
  When the meeting began, Li Ruihuan congratulated the Chinese 
Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong on its 60th founding 
anniversary and welcomed the association's friends on their 
visit to Beijing. He said: The Chinese Manufacturers' 
Association of Hong Kong is a business group with extensive 
influence. Over the years you have accomplished a great deal of 
work in promoting Hong Kong's prosperity and development, as 
well as in supporting China's reform, opening up, and 
modernization. Li Ruihuan urged the association's friends to 
continue to work hard to make new contributions to Hong Kong's 
stability and prosperity. 
  During the meeting, Li Ruihuan also answered the visitors' 
questions on how to maintain Hong Kong's stability and 
prosperity during the transitional period. 
  Also present at the meeting were Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman 
of the CPPCC National Committee and head of the CPC Central 
Committee United Front Department; Jing Shuping, chairman of the 
All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce; and Chen Ziying, 
vice chairman of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office.

  [Text] Beijing, 16 Jun (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang quipped this afternoon in 
reference to the DPRK's nuclear issue: "Lest we have a war on 
our lap even before there is an atomic bomb." 
  Shen stated here at the routine news briefing that in 
principle, China is against the involvement of the UN Security 
Council in the DPRK's nuclear issue and the means of sanctions. 
He held that even now there remain both room and possibilities 
for properly solving the DPRK's nuclear issue. As long as the 
concerned four corners and three sides give 100 percent of what 
they have, they still can promote peace, stability, and 
denuclearization on the Korean peninsula through dialogue. Shen 
said that it is to this goal that China is directing its efforts. 
  As quite a number of reporters had asked him about the 
possibility of the outbreak of war, Shen Guofang stressed more 
than once that right now he hopes that instead of talking about 
war, people should talk about how to solve the problem. So far, 
there is no evidence indicating that the DPRK has a nuclear 
arsenal. "Lest we have a war on our lap even before there is an 
atomic bomb." "No side wishes to see the outbreak of war, which 
would be highly unfavorable for Northeast Asia." 
  Shen Guofang said that the channel between the United States 
and the DPRK remains open and he hopes for "reopening the 
dialogue." 
  On China's recent nuclear test, Shen Guofang said: China has 
always been restrained in nuclear testing and is the country to 
conduct the fewest nuclear tests among the nuclear powers. 
Equally, China hopes to see a total ban on nuclear testing and 
to participate in talks related to the subject. Shen believes 
that the first step toward global denuclearization is that 
nuclear powers do not threaten to launch preemptive strikes.

  [Text] Since mid-May, the Vietnamese side has sent 
exploratory vessels to the Wan An Reef area of China's Nansha 
[Spratly] marine area to carry out geophysical operations. 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang today issued a 
statement on this. 
  The statement says: As is known to all, China has 
indisputable sovereignty over the Nansha Islands and their 
adjacent waters, and the Wan An Reef is part of the Nansha 
Islands. In recent years, Vietnam has demarcated certain blocks 
in this area for external bidding and has on many occasions 
harassed the normal scientific survey and fishing activities of 
Chinese vessels. Now it has moved into this area for oil and 
gas prospecting and development. It must be pointed out that 
these moves have seriously violated China's sovereignty over the 
Nansha Islands and have also put the Wab-21 petroleum contract 
signed between the China National Offshore Oil Corporation and 
the Crestone Energy Corporation of the United States, which 
covers this area, in serious jeopardy. The Chinese side has 
made solemn representations on many occasions to the Vietnamese 
side over its acts of violating China's sovereignty in the 
Nanshas. The Chinese Government demands once again that the 
Vietnamese Government, in proceeding from the overall interests 
of maintaining and developing bilateral relations and preserving 
peace and stability in the region, stop the aforementioned acts 
of infringement upon China's sovereignty. 
  Shen Guofang also announced: Vice President Joseph Estrada 
of the Republic of the Philippines will pay an official visit to 
China from 18 to 25 June at the invitation of Chinese Vice 
President Rong Yiren. A delegation of the Supreme Soviet of the 
Republic of Tajikistan will pay an official goodwill visit to 
China from 21 to 28 June, as guests of China's National People's 
Congress Standing Committee. 
  Shen Guofang also answered questions raised by reporters on 
the Korean nuclear issue, Sino-British relations, and the Hong 
Kong issue.

  [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
said here today that he expects his upcoming European trip to 
help increase understanding and trust as well as cooperation 
with the countries he is to visit. 
  Following the Foreign Ministry's announcement of Li's 
official visit to Austria, Germany and Romania from June 29 to 
July 12, the premier met with the ambassadors of the three 
countries this afternoon. 
  Li said that China enjoys sound relations with the three 
countries and China's friendly cooperation with them is 
expanding constantly. 
  "A long-term, stable and comprehensive cooperation between 
China and the three countries is not only in line with their own 
interests, but beneficial to world peace and development as 
well," he said. 
  Hoping the coming visit would further push forward Chinese 
friendship and cooperation with the three countries, Li said he 
expects to exchange views on a broad range of major world issues 
with the leaders of these countries. 
  The Chinese premier said that trade and economic ties take a 
major position in China's relations with the three countries, 
and China attaches much importance to developing this 
relationship, Li said, and this can be well demonstrated by the 
fact that a large group of entrepreneurs from major Chinese 
enterprises will be with him during the trip and will discuss 
trade and economic cooperation with their partners there. 
  Romanian Ambassador Romulus-Ioan Budura said Li's scheduled 
visit to Romania is of major significance and he will be 
accorded the most courteous reception. 
  The visit will exert a positive influence on Romania-China 
relations and the regional situation as well, the ambassador 
said. 
  Austrian Ambassador Dietrich Bukowski said that the Austria 
visit, the first one made by a Chinese premier, will bring 
bilateral relations to their highest point since the two 
countries established diplomatic ties 23 years ago. 
  He expects the visit to speed up the development of 
bilateral 
relations, especially trade and economic ties. 
  German Ambassador Armin Freitag said that he believes Li's 
visit to Germany will play an important role in furthering trade 
and economic cooperation, increasing political dialogue and 
promoting cultural exchanges between the two countries. 
  He said that Germany expects much to result from Li's 
upcoming visit and wishes it a great success.

  [Text] Moscow, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev said today the U.S. draft resolution on 
phased UN sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea (DPRK) contradicts an earlier agreement reached between 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  The document was distributed at the United Nations Security 
Council by the United States on Wednesday [15 June]. 
  Kozyrev told reporters that he was confused by the fact that 
"American diplomats had distributed in New York a draft 
resolution containing a concrete list of sanctions" against DPRK. 
  The U.S. move was made contrary to the "absolutely clear" 
agreement reached in a telephone conversation between Yeltsin 
and Clinton, as well as between their foreign ministers "to act 
jointly, to work on the draft resolution together and not to 
make unilateral initiative," Kozyrev pointed out. 
  He stressed that "in any case we shall not support the set 
of 
sanctions proposed without a preliminary agreement with us."

  [Text] Moscow, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin and his visiting Vietnamese counterpart Vo 
Van Kiet failed to sign the treaty on friendly relations on 
Thursday [18 June] because of contradictions over several 
issues, the ITAR- TASS NEWS AGENCY reported. 
  It said the disputed issues include prospecting and 
production of oil and natural gas by joint "Vietsovpetro" 
venture, the problems of the Vietnamese community in Russia and 
the Russian naval base in Vietnam's Cam Ranh. 
  The Vietnamese premier, who arrived in Moscow on Wednesday 
for a three-day official visit, held talks with Chernomyrdin on 
Thursday morning. He is also expected to meet with Russian

  [Text] Moscow, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Vietnamese Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet, who is in Moscow on a three-day official 
visit, remains optimistic about prospects of signing a bilateral 
treaty with Russia, though the sides failed to sign it during 
Thursday's [18 June] talks. 
  Commenting on his talks with Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, the Vietnamese premier told reporters: "Talks with 
the Russian side are going on productively. The new interstate 
treaty has been in general agreed upon and it is very important." 
  He said the document would be signed after certain 
improvements. The signing of the treaty, which was originally 
scheduled to take place at mid-day on Thursday, was put off till 
the evening. 
  A sources close to the Russian Government said the sides had 
failed to eliminate various disagreements during the talks 
between the two premiers. 
  Sources from the Vietnamese delegation explained that the 
disputed issues include prospecting and production of oil and 
natural gas by the joint "Vietsovpetro" venture, the problems of 
the Vietnamese community in Russia, as well as the Russian naval 
base in Cam Ranh. 
  To explain the delay of the signing of the documents, 
Chernomyrdin said that "matters of technical presentation" 
requiring specialists' attention cropped up during discussion. 
"Essentially, there have been no differences," he noted. 
  "We are convinced that Russia and Vietnam have every 
opportunity and potential to step up traditional cooperation in 
the commercial, economic, technological, scientific and other 
areas," he said. 
  However, the Vietnamese premier said the two sides differed 
on the following matters: the problem of paying off Vietnam's 
debt to Russia inherited from the former Soviet Union, terms of 
the operation of Cam Ranh base by the Russian Navy, and issues 
about the stay of Vietnamese citizens in Russia.

  [Text] Haikou, June 16 (XINHUA) -- The United Nations 
Children's Fund (UNICEF) has played an active role in China's 
health education program in recent years. 
  From 1990 to 1993, it provided 1.2 million U.S. dollars to 
aid the program. 
  China started the health education program in the early 
1980s. The program is aimed at popularization of health 
knowledge to change unhealthy living habits and behavior. 
  With the improvement of medical conditions, epidemic 
diseases 
have been on the decline, but some chronic diseases such as 
heart disease and high blood pressure have increased. 
  In 1994-95, UNICEF invested another 800,000 U.S. dollars in 
the program to be carried out in 18 provinces and regions 
including Hainan, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Gansu, Tibet, 
Qinghai, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and Guangxi. 
  According to an official from UNICEF who is attending a 
training class under the health education program in Haikou, 
capital of Hainan Province, UNICEF's aid program also involves 
women's and children's health education, epidemic prevention, 
and endemic disease prevention.

<F P=106> [By XINHUA correspondents Li Jianmin and Zhou Zongmin] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, June 17 (XINHUA) -- A growing number of 
the world's leading investors are flocking to China, a huge 
market of 1.2 billion people, as the country's economy continues 
booming. 
  Fifty-two giant transnational conglomerates, listed among 
the 
world's top 500 companies in the U.S. "FORTUNE" magazine, have 
pumped money into China since 1993, with a total contractual 
capital of four billion U.S. dollars, said officials from the 
State Administration of Industry and Commerce (SAIC), in a 
recent exclusive interview with XINHUA. 
  The arrival of leading international investors marked a 
significant shift in China's introduction of foreign investment 
which had been dominated by relatively small projects, the 
officials said. More fund and technology-intensive projects are 
coming in, they added. 
  "China's fast-growing economy and improved investment 
environment are major factors behind the transnational 
companies' favoring China," said Martin Claus, chief 
representative of the German KHD Company's Beijing office. KHD, 
one of the most prestigious engineering firms in the world, is 
now close to signing a 400- million-U.S. dollar contract with 
China. 
  China's economy has been growing at double-digit pace over 
the past several years and is expected to grow 12 percent in the 
first half of this year and 10 percent for the whole year. 
  Latest statistics indicate that transnational companies 
account for about half of the total foreign investment in China 
since 1993. 
  According to the SAIC officials, over 3,700 foreign firms 
have established representative offices or branches in China 
since the beginning of last year, including some 260 powerful 
companies. Among them are big names like Du Pont, General 
Electric, Siemens, IBM, Philips, Mitsubishi and National. While 
bringing investments to China, the transnationals have come 
along with more projects of technical cooperation. 
  Apart from Western firms, rising giants from 
newly-industrialized countries and regions, such as Singapore 
and the Republic of Korea, are also elbowing for a share in the 
Chinese market. 
  A survey conducted recently by an international organization 
shows that 98 percent of U.S. firms interviewed have listed 
China as the best place for investment. 
  Attracting big transnational firms has been China's main 
target in the 1990s. Foreign investments in chunks up to 10 
million dollars are most welcome, particularly in key economic 
fields such as infrastructure and basic industries. 
  More big international firms are putting money in these 
sectors as well as the service industries, said an official of 
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. 
  China has announced that its imports will be as high as 
1,000 
billion dollars in the remaining years before the end of the 
century. And foreign investors now face a good prospect.

"A Move That Is Hard To Understand"] 
  [Text] On 8 June the three parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
reached an agreement in Geneva on a complete cease fire for a 
month. The following day, the U.S. House of Representatives 
passed a resolution, calling on the Clinton administration to 
unilaterally lift the arms embargo on Bosnia. In response to 
this, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev pointed out in 
Moscow on 14 June that such a move would lead to a complicated 
political situation. General Ross, commander of the UN 
peacekeeping force in Bosnia, expressed disappointment, saying 
that the U.S. congressional decision was tantamount to 
"undermining the Bosnian peace process." 
  In September 1991 the UN Security Council passed a 
resolution 
calling on all countries to impose an arms embargo on all 
republics in the former Yugoslavia. The current U.S. 
congressional decision actually wants the U.S. Government to 
ignore the Security Council resolution and act independently. 
Judging from their reactions, the relevant quarters obviously 
find it hard to understand and cannot agree with the idea of 
unilaterally lifting the arms embargo. 
  On the question of maintaining the arms embargo on all 
parties in the Bosnian conflict, there always have been 
differences of opinion between the United States, the European 
alliance, and Russia. The United States has constantly stressed 
that failure to provide arms to the Muslims has "undermined the 
military balance among all the parties in Bosnia" and is "not 
conducive to the peace process." In the view of European 
countries, however, the argument that it would be conducive to 
peace to provide a large amount of weapons to a certain party in 
Bosnia is "illogical." Although the United States intends to 
lift the arms embargo on the Muslims, it does not want to act 
alone for fear that this would undermine cooperation with the 
allies and Russia on the Bosnian issue and would bring about 
"serious consequences." 
  The aforementioned resolution of the U.S. Congress has 
deepened people's impression: Just as the Bosnian peace process 
is making some headway, there seem to be some discordant voices 
coming from the United States to cause fluctuations in the peace 
process. People still remember that when the seven foreign 
ministers of the United States, Europe, and Russia reached an 
agreement on the Bosnian issue in Geneva a month ago, the U.S. 
Senate passed a resolution calling on the government to 
unilaterally lift the arms embargo on Bosnia. It aroused a 
strong reaction from the Russian parliament. On this occasion, 
just as the three parties in Bosnia had reached a cease-fire 
agreement, the U.S. Congress again called on the government to 
unilaterally lift the arms embargo on Bosnia in an attempt to 
place its own resolution above that of the Security Council. 
  The month-long cease-fire agreement reached in Geneva among 
the three parties in Bosnia is the first complete cease-fire 
agreement reached by all parties since the Bosnian civil war 
broke out two years ago. It was not easy to come by and 
generally has held so far. All parties to the Bosnian conflict, 
as well as the major powers concerned, should treasure this 
achievement. Particularly in a crucial situation, it is better 
to act with prudence.

  [Text] Seoul, June 17 (XINHUA) -- South Korea has decided 
to concentrate on a peaceful settlement of the nuclear problem 
of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) through 
dialogue such as a high-level meeting between Washington and 
Pyongyang. 
  The decision was made at a Unification and Security Policy 
Coordination Committee Meeting presided over by Deputy Prime 
Minister and National Unification Board (NUB) Minister Yi 
Hong-ku here Friday [17 June]. 
  Former President of the United States Jimmy Carter, who is 
currently on a visit in Pyongyang, held first round of talks 
with the DPRK's President Kim Il-song yesterday on ways to find 
a solution to the nuclear issue. 
  Kim was quoted as telling Carter that his country has 
changed 
its mind and will let two inspectors of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) remain in the DPRK. 
  Meanwhile, Carter reportedly said that Washington-Pyongyang 
high- level talks may resume if the DPRK freezes its nuclear 
program. 
  The U.S. and the DPRK held two rounds of high-level talks on 
the nuclear issue in June and July last year. The third round 
of talks, which had been scheduled for March 21 this year, was 
cancelled due to differences between the two sides. 
  The South Korean Government will announce its position on 
Pyongyang's new sign of reconciliation after President Kim 
Yong-sam meets with Carter again over the weekend, officials 
here said. 
  Carter, who went to Pyongyang through the heavily-fortified 
border village of Panmunjom after a three-day visit to South 
Korea, will return to Seoul via Panmunjom Saturday to brief 
President Kim Yong-sam on the results of his talks with DPRK 
leaders before heading back to Washington. 
  The former U.S. President said earlier that his trip would 
be 
a private one aiming "to discuss some of the important issues of 
the day with leaders of the area." 
  The United States yesterday submitted a draft resolution at 
the United Nations Security Council calling for sanctions 
against the DPRK, which on Monday withdrew from IAEA, the United 
Nations nuclear watchdog, and declared not to accept any more 
inspections of its nuclear program.

<F P=106> [Li Shaowen "Commentary"] </F>
  [Text] North Korea says it would immediately withdraw from 
the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and rejects any 
inspection of its nuclear facilities. It now sees any UN 
sanctions as an act of war. Li Shaowen has a commentary: 
  Pyongyang is toughening its stand in the wake of mounting 
pressure. It will not reverse its decision until the nuclear 
issue has been solved fairly through dialogue and negotiations. 
A North Korean Foreign Ministry statement issued on Monday [13 
June] charges the IAEA with committing an act of grave 
encroachment on its dignity and sovereignty. 
  The United States responded immediately. The State 
Department said on Tuesday [14 June] that Washington has worked 
out a draft resolution calling for UN economic sanctions. Also 
on Tuesday, North Korea's UN ambassador said its government has 
informed the United States of its decision to withdraw from the 
agency. It will also order the remaining two agency inspectors 
to leave the country. 
  North Korea and the IAEA have been differing over the 
nuclear 
fuel rods replacement. The agency accused Pyongyang of blocking 
a full inspection of the refueling process. The United States 
suspected it transferred plutonium from the Yongbyong nuclear 
reactor for its weapons program. On 10 June, the IAEA adopted a 
resolution urging North Korea to open its military facilities 
and suspended the agency's assistance to it. The United States, 
South Korea, and Japan agreed on imposing UN economic sanctions 
on Pyongyang. Washington has been lobbying support for the 
measures but failed to win any agreements from the international 
community. 
  Russia has called for an international conference to find a 
solution to the issue. On Monday, President Boris Yeltsin 
discussed the latest development with his U.S. counterpart Bill 
Clinton by a telephone call. They also discussed ways to settle 
it through political means. 
  China is opposed to sanctions imposed on North Korea. 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen has stressed the denuclearization 
of the Korean peninsula and regional stability as two of the 
goals in the fundamental interest of Asia-Pacific countries. 
China has time and again called for dialogue to resolve the 
dispute and appealed to the international community for 
restraint from taking hasty actions. 
  The door is still open for a political solution. North Korea 
has been calling for the resumption of talks with the United 
States on the issue before considering further inspections. It 
has threatened to withdraw from the IAEA and has not done yet. 
What is more, it is still a signatory to the nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty. All this indicates that only dialogue 
can bring about a resolution. Further confrontation and 
hostilities will just intensify the already tense situation and 
will cause a greater threat to regional peace and stability. 
After all, talks, however tough, are better than extreme 
actions.

<F P=106> ["Commentary" by staff reporters Xu Shiquan (6079 0013 6898) </F>
and He Hongze (0149 3163 3419): "Dialogue Is Better Than 
Confrontation"] 
  [Text] United Nations, 13 Jun (RENMIN RIBAO) -- Recently, 
Korea's nuclear issue once again has become a topic of concern 
and discussion at the UN Headquarters building. 
  Owing to the differences between the IAEA and Korea over the 
replacing of nuclear fuel rods since March this year, the 
situation concerning Korea's nuclear issue, which had been 
developing in a positive direction, unexpectedly took a sudden 
turn. While the IAEA decided on 10 June to suspend enforcement 
of the technological cooperation plan with Korea on uranium 
exploration and the peaceful use of nuclear energy, Korea 
declared that it would withdraw from the agency immediately. On 
the other hand, the United States carried out frequent 
activities within and without the United Nations, expecting the 
Security Council to impose sanctions against Korea. 
  It remains fresh in our minds that the United States has 
lobbied for this on more than one occasions, but its proposal 
was not well received by the international community. There was 
even objection to the proposal from U.S. political circles and 
the media. The Chinese delegation has always been against the 
Security Council's involvement in the Korean nuclear issue and a 
resolution on this adopted by the Security Council which 
includes sanctions. The Chinese representative has pointed out 
on numerous occasions that the four parties of the United 
States, the IAEA, Korea, and the ROK should iron out their 
differences and resolve the problem through dialogue and talks 
within the tripartite framework. Neither threats nor pressure 
will work; they will only intensify the contradictions and play 
a destructive role. Based on this principle, the Chinese 
delegation, in light of the given circumstances at that time, 
adopted a constructive attitude and comprehensively expounded 
the position of the Chinese Government on the question following 
the statement issued by the Security Council chairman on the 
Korean nuclear crisis in hopes that efforts would be made by the 
parties concerned to continue the talks and seek an appropriate 
solution. 
  Facts have proved that with the concerted efforts made by 
the 
parties concerned, the talks on the Korean nuclear issue at the 
previous stage developed in a positive direction despite the 
difficulties encountered. The United States reached a 
principled agreement with Korea last June, Korea announced a 
unilateral decision on suspending its withdrawal from the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], and Korea reached new 
agreements with IAEA and the United States, respectively, on 15 
and 25 February this year, followed by the IAEA's inspection of 
Korea's relevant nuclear facilities and completion of most of 
its mission. At present, differences and difficulties have 
cropped up concerning Korea's nuclear fuel rods. It should be 
noted that these differences and difficulties are temporary, as 
they have cropped up in the course of efforts made to resolve 
the problem. Meanwhile, there is still room for maneuver and a 
possibility of reaching a solution. 
  On the Korean nuclear issue, China has always regarded the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, as well as peace and 
stability on the peninsula, as the two major targets. This 
position has become the common understanding of the members of 
the Security Council, and has won widespread support from the 
international community. As long as the parties concerned have 
such sincerity and make unswerving efforts toward this dual 
objective, it is possible gradually to iron out the differences 
and reach an understanding. 
  The most important thing at present is that the parties 
concerned should keep calm and exercise restraint. There is an 
ancient Chinese saying: "Think of reason when you are enraged 
and never forget principles at the critical moment." In the 
face of the temporary disputes, if one side insists on imposing 
sanctions and exerting pressure, and even hastily threaten to 
use force, the positive achievements attained at the previous 
stage between the four parties and three sides will come to 
nothing. Moreover, the contradictions will be intensified 
again. The international community will not want to see or 
accept the consequences arising from shutting the door to 
negotiations. The deterioration and turbulence of the situation 
on the Korean peninsula not only will cause devastating damage 
to northeast Asia, but also will affect world peace and 
stability. As the matter is serious, the parties concerned 
should think thrice before taking action, and should define the 
reason and principles clearly. Sanctions and threats will be of 
no avail. The best option is to calmly and patiently hold 
talks. After all, dialogue is better than confrontation.

<F P=106> [By reporter Cui Tiemin (1508 6993 3046): "Acting Governor </F>
Wen Shizhen Meets With and Entertains Korean Guests"] 
  [Text] At the invitation of the provincial government, the 
8-member friendship delegation from North Pyongan Province, the 
DPRK, headed by Yom Chae-man, chairman of the Administrative and 
Economic Committee of North Pyongan Province, came to our 
province for a friendly visit on 3 June. 
  When the delegation arrived at the Shenyang north station at 
1515 in the afternoon, Acting Governor Wen Shizhen; Vice 
Governor Gao Guozhu; Ren Dianxi, vice mayor of Shenyang city; 
Zhang Xingnan, secretary general of the provincial government; 
and other provincial and city leaders warmly embraced and 
greeted the Korean guests. At the platform of the railway 
station, over 400 children sang and danced with bouquets of 
flowers in their hands to warmly welcome the delegation's visit. 
  At 1630, Acting Governor Wen Shizhen met with the delegation 
at the provincial government office. On behalf of the 
provincial government and the people across the province, Wen 
Shizhen extended a warm welcome to Chairman Yom Chae-man and his 
entourage for paying a visit to the province. He said: The two 
countries of China and the DPRK are linked by common mountains 
and rivers and the two peoples are bound together by ties of 
fraternal friendship. Under the cordial concerns of the party 
Central Committees of the two countries, the peoples of the two 
provinces have helped and supported each another, made important 
contributions to their respective socialist construction, and 
made due contributions to developing friendship between the two 
countries of China and the DPRK and between the two peoples. In 
the future, we will continue our efforts to promote and develop 
the friendly relationship between the two provinces and further 
deepen the friendship between the two countries and between the 
peoples of the border areas of the two countries. Wen Shizhen 
expressed that as a close and friendly neighbor, the people of 
Liaoning Province have always been concerned with the 
development of the Korean socialist revolutionary and 
construction undertakings. We heartily wish the fraternal 
Korean people new and greater success in their future 
revolutionary and construction cause. Wen Shizhen also briefed 
the guests on our province's situations in reform, opening up, 
and economic development. 
  Chairman Yom Chae-man thanked the people of our province for 
giving the delegation a warm and friendly reception. He said: 
In March 1990, I led a delegation to visit Liaoning Province. 
Although it is only a short span of four years between these 
two visits, I am very pleased to see that the people of Liaoning 
Province have scored tremendous achievements in building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics under the leadership of 
the CPC. We heartily rejoice at this and sincerely wish you 
greater achievements in the future. He expressed that he would 
exert utmost efforts to further develop the friendly cooperative 
relationship between the two provinces. 
  That evening, Acting Governor Wen Shizhen held a banquet in 
honor of the delegation at Youyi Guest House in Shenyang. 
  Cho Kil-chun, consul general of the DPRK Consulate in 
Shenyang, attended the banquet. 
  The delegation came to Shenyang by way of Dandong. When the 
delegation arrived in Dandong city, it was greeted by Liu 
Tingyao, mayor of Dandong city, and others. 
  Sui Xudong, director of the provincial foreign affairs 
office, made a special trip to Dandong to greet the delegation 
and accompany it to Shenyang.

<F P=106> [From the "Night News" program] </F>
  [Text] The State Environmental Protection Bureau and the 
General Administration of Customs recently commended 12 Jiangsu 
units for returning 1,288 tonnes of hazardous chemical wastes to 
overseas consignees. This serious incident of illegal import of 
hazardous wastes, which occurred half a year ago, has been 
initially settled. 
  This serious incident occurred on 25 September last year. 
Without receiving prior approval from environmental protection 
departments, Beijing's (Zhongmaofa) Company and Nanjing's 
(Huagu) Company imported 1,288 tonnes of so-called fuel oil from 
South Korea to Nanjing Port's (Shanyuan) Wharf. After a sample 
check by Jiangsu Import and Export Commodity Inspection Bureau 
personnel, they found that the shipment was not fuel oil, but 
hazardous chemical wastes. The Nanjing New District Customs 
immediately blocked the release of the problematic shipment. 
Due to the cooperation among relevant state and Jiangsu 
departments, the illegally imported wastes had all been safely 
returned to the consignee on 5 March this year. A check shows 
that during the five-month stay of these hazardous wastes in 
Nanjing Port, no incident of pollution was reported, thanks to 
the joint supervision of the Jiangsu and Nanjing Environmental 
Protection Bureaus. Although these hazardous wastes had been 
returned to the consignee, there is no knowing what kind of 
punishment will be meted to those who were responsible for 
importing these wastes in the first place.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, June 16 (XINHUA) -- The round-table 
meeting on peace and national reconciliation in Cambodia ended 
Thursday [16 June] with the royal government and the Democratic 
Kampuchea Party (DKP) failing to reach agreement on a cease-fire 
and a minimum political principle. 
  After the meeting, a spokesman for the royal government 
admitted that nothing came out of the meeting but added that it 
was "not a failure." 
  The spokesman said that during the meeting, the royal 
government side offered a deadline of noon on June 30 for a 
cease-fire to be imposed, while the DKP wished to discuss the 
details of establishing a monitoring committee. 
  The DKP criticized the government side for refusing to 
discuss in depth the problem of monitoring a cease-fire and 
refusing to discuss the minimum political principle on peace and 
national reconciliation. 
  The round table meeting opened on Wednesday and although 
neither side has decided whether to hold another, the 
possibility of further talks depends on King Norodom Sihanouk.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, June 16 (XINHUA) -- A representative of 
the president of the Democratic Kampuchea Party (DKP) Khieu 
Samphan said here today that a minimum political platform is 
essential to the achievement of the unity of all Cambodian 
national forces. 
  Chan Youran made the remark while clarifying the DKP's 
proposal for a minimum political platform at today's round table 
meeting on peace and national reconciliation in Cambodia. 
  However, the government side refused to discuss the platform 
and insisted that an agreement on the timetable of the 
cease-fire should come first and that the political platform 
issue should be tackled later. As a result, the round table 
talks broke down at noon without making any progress. 
  Chan said that the proposal calling on all Cambodian parties 
to agree on a minimum political platform "is another testimony 
of the sense of responsibility of the DKP and of its willingness 
to strive for genuine and lasting national reconciliation." 
  Earlier, DKP President Khieu Samphan said at the Pyongyang's 
round table talks on May 27 that the platform "will serve as the 
basis for the formation of a national government and a unified 
national army." The co-prime ministers of Cambodia contended 
that this would mean the dissolution of the royal government and 
the royal armed forces and was therefore unacceptable. 
  After the collapse of the talks today, the government side 
noted that there is no need to meet again as the two round-table 
talks held so far have both ended fruitlessly. But the DKP 
suggested continuation of the talks. 
  Nhiek Tioulong, representative of King Norodom Sihanouk, 
said 
he will report to the king about the talks and Sihanouk would 
decide whether or not to continue the talks.

  [Text] Manila, June 16 (XINHUA) -- The Philippines' exports 
to China is projected to increase by 70 percent this year 
following the signing of a protocol on the importation and 
exportation of commodities between the two countries, an 
industry leader said today. 
  Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Herman 
Montenegro, who recently visited China together with a 
Philippine trade mission, said there is vast opportunities for 
Philippine products in China. 
  Montenegro said Philippine construction materials like 
saniware products are hot and fast selling items in China as the 
country is currently experiencing a wave of construction 
activity. 
  In Beijing alone, he said, some 10 million square meters is 
being constructed annually. 
  The bilateral trade between the Philippines and China 
amounted to 480 million U.S. dollars and is expected to increase 
by 35 percent this year, according to the Department of Trade 
and Industry. 
  The trade mission, Montenegro said, was able to establish a 
trade desk in Guangdong Province which would help establish 
contact between Chinese and Filipino businessmen. 
  Another mission is being planned for October this year with 
the objective of organizing focus groups in Beijing, Shanghai, 
Xiamen and Guandong, Montenegro said.

  [Text] Canberra, June 17 (XINHUA) -- The Australian Trade 
Commission (Austrade), the government trade arms, has appointed 
Martin Walsh senior trade commissioner to Shanghai, China's 
largest industrial and financial center. 
  Walsh said today that as Shanghai is increasingly taking on 
the role of China's financial and industrial hub, "Austrade is 
now expanding its services in Shanghai." 
  This is in line with the government initiative to help 
Australian business get better access to the tremendous 
development now going on in the east China region, he said in a 
statement. 
  Walsh, who will take up his position on July 15, has been 
manager of Austrade's east Asia regional support office in 
Sydney since 1993. 
  Speaking fluent mandarin Chinese and with an extensive 
background in Chinese business culture, Walsh was posted as 
Austrade trade commissioner in south China from 1985 to 1988 and 
as trade development director at the Australian Commerce and 
Industry Office in Taipei from 1989 to 1992. 
  He said that "Shanghai itself is growing rapidly" and he 
would focus on its Pudong Economic Development Zone. 
  "We are focusing strongly on the new Pudong finance and 
industrial development area on the opposite bank of the Huangpu 
River to the Bund," he added. 
  He said that "this will be a massive commercial center." 
  Australia has shifted its trade focus to Asia in recent 
years 
in a hope of taking advantage of booming economies in the Asian 
region to give an impetus to the country's economy. 
  Trade and economic ties between China and Australia have 
increased in the past years as the thriving economic growth in 
China, especially in east China, has lured more Australian 
business. 
  Australia's investment in China has reached to 1.25 billion 
U.S. dollars in terms of contracted value by the end of last 
year, making it the 9th largest foreign investor in China.

  [Text] Brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, Presidential 
Council member, met yesterday in Beijing with Chinese Vice 
President Rong Yiren. He gave him a message from Brother 
Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the Presidential 
Council chairman, to Chinese President Jiang Zemin. The message 
concerns ties between our country and the PRC as well as the 
latest developments in our country. 
  The Yemeni News Agency, SABA', has learned that during the 
meeting, Brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, Presidential 
Council member, briefed the Chinese vice president, and through 
him the Chinese leadership, on the events and the bloody battles 
imposed on our people by the forces of apostasy and secession, 
which have violated the will of the people and dealt a 
treacherous blow to their aspirations and great achievements. 
  Brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani stressed that Yemen 
rejects any attempt to interfere in its domestic affairs. He 
also underlined the need to respect the political aspirations of 
the Yemeni people in unity, democracy, and progress. 
  The brother Presidential Council member voiced the 
appreciation of Yemen -- both people and government -- for the 
attitude displayed by the Chinese Government in the 
international forums in support of the Yemeni people's 
aspirations, unity, and democratic march. 
  For his part, the Chinese vice president welcomed Brother 
'Abd- al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani. He reviewed the ties between the 
Yemeni and Chinese peoples and stressed the need to continue and 
improve cooperation in all fields. He also said he regrets what 
is going on in Yemen and said he hopes problems will be resolved 
through dialogue. He asked the Presidential Council member to 
convey his and the Chinese president's greetings to the Yemeni 
leadership and people. 
  In a related development, a lengthy meeting was held between 
'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, Presidential Council member, and 
Qian Qichen, China's vice premier and foreign minister. 
  The brother Presidential Council member reviewed all 
developments in our country and shed light on all attitudes and 
attempts by our country's political leadership under Brother 
Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the Presidential 
Council chairman, to resolve the political crisis. That crisis 
started in 19 August 1993 and escalated since then according to 
a planned scheme by the gang of apostasy and secession, starting 
with the seclusion [of Ali Salim al-Bid] and the political 
maneuvers, and ending with the ill-omened declaration of 
secession, which directed a stab to the will of our people and 
their national principles. 
  He also stressed that all legitimate constitutional 
institutions are keen to start the dialogue within the framework 
of the national constants, particularly unity, democracy, and 
respect for constitutional legitimacy and its institutions. He 
explained that the political leadership has responded favorably 
to all the good initiatives by the brothers and friends. He 
stressed that Yemen abides by UN Security Council Resolution 924 
on the situation in our country and supports all the efforts 
seeking to help resolve problems within the framework of the 
national constants, respect for the principle of noninterference 
in domestic affairs, and the protection of Yemen's sovereignty 
and unity. 
  The Chinese vice premier and foreign minister voiced his 
appreciation for the clarifications made by 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
'Abd-al- Ghani, Presidential Council member. He said China was 
among the first states to support Yemeni unity when it was 
established in 1990 since Yemen, a country with a great history 
and an old civilization, has always been a united country. He 
regretted the fighting in Yemen and wished Yemen, a friend of 
China, unity, prosperity, stability, and progress. He 
underlined his country's position, which supports the solution 
of crises through peaceful dialogue and noninterference in the 
others' affairs since this is one of the most important 
principles on which international relations are based. 
  The two meetings were attended by Brother Ghalib Sa'id 
al-Abukhi, our ambassador in Beijing. 
  'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, Presidential Council member, 
received at his place of residence in the Guest House in Beijing 
the brother Arab ambassadors and heads of diplomatic missions, 
as well as the Arab League representative. 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
'Abd-al-Ghani gave a comprehensive review of the developments in 
our country. He also answered the ambassadors' questions. They 
all wished Yemen stability and prosperity under the canopy of 
its unity, which is considered a gain for all citizens of the 
Arab and Muslim nations.

  [Text] Nanjing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Inchcape Pacific, part 
of Inchcape, a large international services and marketing group 
based in Britain, has stepped up its drive into China with a 
series of investments in Nanjing, capital of east China's 
Jiangsu Province. 
  The company has acquired a leading motor distribution and 
service company, formed a joint venture to promote sales of 
consumer goods in central China, and established a wholly-owned 
investment holding company. 
  Paul M.F. Cheng, chairman of Inchcape Pacific, said 
yesterday 
at a press conference on the establishment of the three new 
enterprises that China is the number one development priority 
for the Inchcape Group worldwide, and these latest moves in 
Nanjing will help accelerate the growth of the company's 
business in China over the next few years. 
  He noted that Nanjing is an important market in its own 
right. It is the capital of Jiangsu Province, which has a 
population of 69 million people, bigger than Great Britain or 
France. Together with Shanghai and Hangzhou, Nanjing forms a 
strategic hub for Inchcape Pacific's further development in the 
Chang Jiang River basin and deeper into central China. 
  The Inchcape Group operates in over 80 countries. It focuses 
on three main areas: motors, marketing and services.

  [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- China values its 
friendly ties with Denmark and hopes for effective cooperation 
in environmental protection and other fields. 
  Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the 
Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference, expressed this at a 
meeting with visiting denmark Minister of Environment Svend 
Auken and his party here today. 
  China is launching a large-scale economic construction and 
environmental problems are becoming more conspicuous each 
passing day, Li said. 
  The country needs, and has put great emphasis on, learning 
from and absorbing advanced foreign expertise in environmental 
protection, he said. 
  In so doing, he said, "we hope to preserve a good 
environment, achieve economic growth and bring benefits to 
future generations." 
  Denmark boasts many advantages in environmental protection, 
he said, voicing the hope that the environmental departments of 
the two countries increase contacts, strengthen exchanges and 
explore new spheres of friendly cooperation. 
  During the meeting, Li recalled his recent visit to Denmark. 
He asked Auken to convey his thanks and best regards to the 
Danish prime minister, president of the parliament and other 
leaders. 
  Though far away from each other, China and Denmark have had 
friendly ties for a long time. Denmark was one of the first 
Western countries to set up diplomatic ties with New China and 
also supported the resumption of China's seat in the United 
Nations, Li noted. 
  Auken said China's economy is growing fast and Denmark is 
keen on extensive cooperation with China in the sector of 
environmental protection. 
  Auken and his party are here as guests of the State Bureau 
for Environmental Protection. Xie Zhenhua, the bureau's 
director, was present at the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
said here today that Sino-French relations have improved greatly 
and turned in a new direction since the recent visit to China by 
the French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. 
  Li made the remarks while meeting this afternoon with 
Jean-Pierre Desgeorges, president of the French-China Committee, 
a French institution designated for promoting trade and economic 
cooperation with China. 
  Desgeorges, once chairman of the French electric company 
Alsthom- Atlantic, has made great efforts to enhance power 
cooperation between China and France. 
  Li expressed his appreciation over the efforts Desgeorges 
and 
other French friends made toward improving bilateral relations 
when the relations met difficulties. 
  On Sino-French economic cooperation, Li said that the two 
countries may increase cooperation on projects with a smaller 
scale of investment besides joining efforts on large projects. 
  Desgeorges said his committee will make greater efforts to 
enhance exchanges and cooperation in the fields of trade and 
economy between France and China.

  [Text] Beijing, 14 Jun (XINHUA) -- The Fifth National 
Congress of Returned Overseas Chinese and Relatives of Chinese 
Nationals Living Abroad opened in the Great Hall of the People 
this afternoon. 
  Prior to the opening, leading cadres, including Jiang Zemin, 
Li Peng, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, and Rong Yiren, met cordially 
all deputies to the congress and posed for group photos. 
  On behalf of the party Central Committee and the State 
Council, Jiang Zemin extended warm greeting to the congress; 
wished the vast numbers of returned Overseas Chinese, relatives 
of Chinese nationals living abroad, and Overseas Chinese all the 
best; and expressed his cordial regards to cadres of the 
All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese [ACFOROC] at 
various levels and to personnel who handle work concerning 
Overseas Chinese. He said that work on Overseas Chinese has 
been long-term, policy-oriented, important work for both the 
party and the state. In the past, returned Overseas Chinese, 
relatives of Chinese nationals living abroad, and Overseas 
Chinese have made outstanding contributions in terms of nation 
revitalization and national construction. In this new period 
when China is accelerating its reform, opening up, and economic 
construction, conscientiously doing a good job in Overseas 
Chinese affairs will be important to the smooth realization of 
China's economic development strategic objectives, to the 
enhancement of friendly exchanges with other countries, and to 
the promotion of the peaceful unification of the motherland. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping, who terms bringing out the positive role 
of the broad Overseas Chinese as an unique opportunity for 
greater development in China, has provided us with important 
guidance with far-reaching significance to improve our work 
under the new situation. Let's take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as 
guidance, seize the opportunity, master the overall situation, 
work hard in unity, and open up a new work horizon for ACFOROC 
designed to contribute even more to revitalizing the Chinese 
nation and unifying the motherland. 
  The congress, which is being attended by 812 deputies and 
specially invited representatives, will examine ACFOROC's Fourth 
Committee work report, scrutinize and adopt its draft 
constitutional amendment, and elect its Fifth Committee. 
  In congratulating the congress on behalf of the party 
Central 
Committee and the State Council, Qian Qichen, a member of the 
CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and State Council vice 
premier, said: ACFOROC, a CPC-led nationwide people's 
organization of returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of 
Chinese nationals living abroad, serves as a bridge and a tie 
linking the party and the government with returned Overseas 
Chinese, relatives of Chinese nationals living abroad, and 
Overseas Chinese. Under the new situation, ACFOROC at various 
levels should unfold its work around the economy; give full play 
to the role of returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of Chinese 
nationals living abroad, and Overseas Chinese in participation 
in government and discussion as well as democratic supervision; 
and protect their lawful interests and legitimate rights in 
China according to the law. It is necessary to fully bring out 
ACFOROC's superiority in conducting nongovernmental exchanges, 
to step up foreign liaison work; to enthusiastically help 
returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of Chinese nationals living 
abroad, and Overseas Chinese in promoting cultural, educational, 
public health, and other social undertakings in China; and to 
thoroughly bring out ACFOROC's role in building the socialist 
spiritual civilization, including promoting the spiritual 
civilization in areas inhabited by returned Overseas Chinese. 
  Qian Qichen said: The party and the government have all 
along 
been attaching importance to work concerning Overseas Chinese. 
From now on, party committees and governments at various levels 
should further strengthen and improve leadership in this respect 
by giving full play to the role of ACFOROC and by showing 
concern for and lending their support enthusiastically. 
  In presenting a work report entitled "Making New 
Contributions Toward the Great Undertaking of Revitalizing the 
Chinese Nation and Unifying the Motherland," ACFOROC President 
Zhuang Yanlin, after reviewing the work of the past five years, 
highlighted the federation's major future tasks as following: 
to closely unite the vast number of returned Overseas Chinese, 
relatives of Chinese nationals living abroad, and Overseas 
Chinese to ensure greater contributions toward accelerating 
China's reform, opening up, and modernization drive; to further 
bring out its role in participation in government and discussion 
as well as democratic supervision; to promote the full 
implementation of "The Law for the Protection of Returned 
Overseas Chinese and Relatives of Chinese Nationals Living 
Abroad" and its "Implementation Rules"; to further bring out 
ACFOROC's superiority in conducting nongovernmental exchanges; 
to open up a new situation in foreign liaison work; to play a 
positive role in building a socialist spiritual civilization; 
and to vigorously promote reform within the ACFOROC itself for 
its improved performance. 
  ACFOROC Vice President Zhuang Shiping made an opening 
speech, 
while Gao Chao, vice president of the Chinese Scientists 
Association, greeted the congress on behalf of various people's 
organizations. 
  Other leading comrades who attended the opening ceremony 
after meeting all the delegates included Lie Jieqiong, Wang 
Guangying, Cheng Siyuan, Wang Zhaoguo, and Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme.

<F P=106> [By reporter Lu Yongjian (7773 3057 1696)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 15 Jun (XINHUA) -- Members of the urban 
flood control inspection group formed by the State Flood Control 
and Drought Relief Headquarters [SFCDRH] has returned to 
Beijing. He Jing, one of the group leaders, SFCDRH deputy 
commander, and vice minister of water resources, stressed that 
responsibility for cities' flood control must be set for 
administrative leaders to discharge, and publicity must be 
intensified to combat indifference. To safeguard cities from 
floods, grass-roots cadres and people must heighten their flood 
control awareness and intensify this year's antiflood 
preparations mentally and organizationally, and with effective 
measures. 
  He Jing continued: Since many Chinese cities are located by 
rivers and lakes, or near the sea, much has to be done in 
protecting these cities from floods. Whether these cities are 
safe from flood damage has a close bearing on China's social 
stability and economic development. Therefore cities' flood 
control is a priority project in China's flood control plan. 
This was why the SFCDRH organized the urban flood control 
inspection group to inspect certain major cities before the 
arrival of the high-water season. 
  According to He Jing, the inspection group -- composed of 
personnel from the State Economic and Trade Commission, State 
Planning Commission, Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry of 
Construction, and General Staff Headquarters, as well as the 
SFCDRH General Office -- inspected flood control projects in 
Jiujiang, Nanchang, Guangzhou, Zhuhai, and Shenzhen from 1 to 10 
June. The group found that these cities have taken flood 
control seriously, their precautionary measures have special 
characteristics, and they are quite successful in one way or 
another. But we must also be aware that the requirements which 
Chinese cities have set for flood control are quite low. For 
example, of the 472 cities with flood control assignments to 
carry out, only 93 of them, or 19.7 percent, have met the 
requirements for combating the kind of floods which occur once 
every 50 years; only 248 of them, or 52.5 percent, are able to 
combat the kind of floods that occur once every 20 years; and 
only 109 of them, or 23.1 percent, are able to combat the kind 
of floods which occur once every 10 years or less. This being 
the case, we must firmly intensify various non-engineering 
measures [fei gong cheng cuo shi 7236 1562 4453 2238 2457], 
heighten our awareness against floods, carry out all measures, 
and be well prepared against serious inundation. 
  He Jing stressed that cities and economic development zones 
must attach importance to flood control projects. She urged 
cities in all parts of the country to achieve even greater 
success in flood control as well as in combating drought. She 
also reminded all localities to tighten inspection, attend to 
usually unheeded areas, and pay special attention to the safety 
of dams located near cities and on the upper reaches of main 
lines of communications during the high-water season.

<F P=106> ["Special interview" with Chen Jiping by staff reporter Liu </F>
Jinghuai (0491 2417 2037); date, place not given: "Radical 
Action Will Be Taken To Improve Rural Public Order -- 
Interviewing Chen Jiping, Deputy Secretary General of the 
Central Commission of Political Science and Law, Member and 
Concurrently General Office Director of the Central Committee 
for Comprehensive Management of Social Security"] 
  [Text] Information from the Central Committee for 
Comprehensive Management of Social Security indicates that 
energetic rectification of public order in rural areas will be a 
formidable task for the comprehensive management of social 
security in China this year. When interviewed by this reporter, 
Chen Jiping, deputy secretary general of the Central Commission 
of Political Science and Law, and concurrently member and 
general office director of the Central Committee for 
Comprehensive Management of Social Security, stressed: In 
rectifying rural public order, we must stick to the principle of 
controlling public security in a comprehensive way and take 
"radical action" to increase the intensity of the work with a 
view to making obvious changes in the situation of rural public 
order in a short period and making further efforts to bring 
about comprehensive development in the rural work. 
  [Chen Jiping] The party Central Committee has invariably 
paid 
serious attention to the issues regarding agriculture, rural 
areas, and peasants. In October last year and in March this 
year, the central authorities convened two successive rural work 
meetings to make overall arrangements for rural work, give 
definite instructions on intensifying the work of 
comprehensively managing social security in rural areas, and 
call for making rapid and marked improvement in rural public 
order within a short period. The action of the central 
authorities to stress rural security work conforms to the 
aspirations of the masses because, after resolving the problem 
of having adequate food and clothing, they wish for a fine 
social environment in which they can live and work in peace and 
contentment. To peasants, the fact that public order is good or 
bad is not a criterion by which to assess the work of a 
department or an organization at any level, but one to judge 
whether or not the party and state really have cared for the 
well-being of the peasants. If the issue of rural public order 
is resolved properly, the party will win sincere support from 
the peasants, and this will be a powerful guarantee for rural 
stability. It can be said that the proper solution of the rural 
public order issue is of decisive significance in maintaining 
stability and prosperity in rural areas, as well as stability 
and development throughout the country. 
  [Liu] Some people have said that the rural public order 
situation in China is deteriorating; what is your view on this? 
What is the real state of affairs regarding rural public order 
in China? 
  [Chen] Generally speaking, rural public order is basically 
stable at present, but the situation in some rural areas is 
grim. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, momentous achievements has been made in the reform to 
restructure the rural economy, and tremendous changes have taken 
place in the appearance of rural areas. The problem of having 
enough to eat and wear has been resolved for the great majority 
of peasants, and quite a few of them have relatively enhanced 
their living standards. This is the most fundamental reason for 
rural stability. 
  Of course, it is necessary to point out that there are some 
rural areas in every province, autonomous region, and 
municipality where public order is bad to varying degrees. In 
some villages, the issue of public order is very conspicuous, 
having the following manifestations: 1) Various kinds of evil 
forces such as hooligans, local ruffians, and village tyrants 
are rampant. They bully the masses and jeopardize society. 2) 
In some areas along highways and water networks, highwaymen, 
train robbers, and pirates run rampant, and serious cases of 
violence including murder, robbery, explosions, and so on have 
increased by a relatively large margin, with their methods of 
committing crimes increasingly cruel. 3) In some areas along 
railways and highways and around oil fields, mines, and some 
large enterprises, mass lawbreaking activities of stealing or 
looting state property cannot be halted despite repeated bans. 
4) Mass fighting with firearms arising from disputes over land, 
forests, irrigation facilities, and so on have occurred 
frequently, and the incidence of fighting has continued to rise. 
5) Ugly social phenomena, including gambling, feudal 
superstition, drug-taking, drug-trafficking, practicing 
prostitution, patronizing prostitutes, and so on, have spread in 
some rural areas. In short, the public security problem in some 
rural areas is very serious, which has evoked strong 
repercussions among the peasants. If we do not concentrate our 
efforts on rectifying these malpractices, but only let them 
continue unbridled, prosperity and stability in rural areas 
certainly will be affected, and the smooth progress of reform 
and opening up will be disrupted. Therefore, the Central 
Committee for Comprehensive Management of Social Security has 
decided to carry out centralized rectification of public order 
in rural areas in the near future, and to vigorously intensify 
the work of controlling social security in a comprehensive way. 
This is a move in conformity with the popular will and in 
keeping with the requirements of maintaining stability and 
prosperity, and of ensuring the smooth progress of reform and 
opening up in rural areas. 
  [Liu] The issue of public order has been a flashpoint 
about which people are always concerned. In recent years, the 
party and state have consistently called for party and 
government organs to take firm control of social security, and 
pertinent departments also have made relentless efforts to 
rectify the problems in rural areas. Why are there still 
prominent social security problems existing in some rural areas? 
  [Chen] In recent years, quite a few localities have carried 
out rectification of public order in rural areas, and the 
Central Committee for Comprehensive Management of Social 
Security also has made deployments for the struggle in specific 
operations regarding rural social security -- such as the 
campaign to combat theft, the operation to surround and 
annihilate "train robbers and highwaymen," and others -- and 
certain results have been attained. Taken as a whole, however, 
the intensity was not stringent enough, and many measures failed 
to be genuinely put into effect at the grass-roots level, so the 
phenomenon of being "hot at the top and cool at the bottom" 
still exists. The major causes are as follows: 1) In some 
localities, the principal leading comrades did not pay adequate 
attention to the problem of rural public order, so that they 
were not powerful enough in work. 2) As some grass-roots 
organizations in townships and villages were lax in discipline, 
they could not exercise their proper role in maintaining social 
security. Meanwhile, these townships and villages also lacked 
ability in performing comprehensive management work, so that 
measures could not be put into practice. 3) As quite a number 
of rural security organizations existed in name only, they were 
in an unorganized state, and villagers were like an expanse of 
loose sand. They also lacked effective mechanisms for 
stimulation and restraint for maintaining public order. 4) Some 
grass-roots political and judicial departments, particularly the 
grass-roots units responsible for cracking down on rural 
lawbreaking activities, did not do their best in carrying out 
the policy of "severe crackdown." 5) There were no effective 
measures for helping and educating local ruffians and village 
gangsters in the course of the crackdown. Moreover, other 
factors -- such as the shortage of cultural life in many rural 
areas, lack of proper guidance for surplus laborers, and so on 
-- also were important causes that led to poor rural public 
order. In short, in a bid to thoroughly resolve the prominent 
social security problems existing in some rural areas, we must 
adhere to the guiding principle of controlling public security 
in a comprehensive way, adopt "radical action" nationwide, and 
increase the intensity of work. 
  [Liu] Nationwide "radical action" to rectify rural public 
order and severely crack down on all sorts of serious criminal 
activities in rural areas indeed accords with the aspirations of 
the vast number of peasants, but how will such "radical action" 
be taken? 
  [Chen] In order to take this "radical action," we call for 
various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities to 
concentrate their efforts this year and next on the 
rectification of conspicuous problems in rural areas where 
public security is in poor shape, so as to facilitate the 
implementation of various measures for the comprehensive 
management of social security. 
  As far as the entire country is concerned, the following 
four 
kinds of people are the key objects of attack in the current 
struggle to rectify rural public order in a concentrated way: 
1) Various kinds of evil forces, such as hooligans, local 
ruffians, and village gangsters, particularly gangs of hoodlums 
and thieves, as well as criminal organizations of an underworld 
nature; 2) train robbers, highwaymen, pirates, and other violent 
criminals who commit murder, robbery, explosions, rape, and so 
on; 3) serious criminals who destroy railroads, damage 
communications and production facilities, and steal or loot 
state property; and 4) organizers of such activities as 
practicing prostitution, patronizing prostitutes, drug 
trafficking, abducting women and children, cheating people of 
their money by means of feudal superstition, producing and 
distributing pornography, and gathering masses for gambling. 
  In a bid to ensure that the current crackdown will be 
conducted with greater intensity, various political and judicial 
departments, under the unified leadership of local party 
committees and governments, should conduct thoroughgoing 
investigations, tick off the conspicuous problems concerning 
public security and the areas where public order is in poor 
shape on a list as quickly as possible, select and transfer 
selected personnel to enhance coordination between departments, 
organize a few large campaigns to puncture the arrogance of 
criminals, and capture in a dragnet all sorts of criminal gangs, 
particularly those who play the tyrant in a particular locality. 
In every link of handling cases, political and judicial 
departments should further straighten out their ideas of law 
enforcement, observe strict discipline, and unswervingly adhere 
to the guiding principle of cracking down on crimes stringently 
and rapidly according to the law. It is necessary to adopt 
vigorous measures to conscientiously study and resolve the 
prominent problems that have hindered the implementation of the 
"severe crackdown" policy. It is all the more necessary to 
further augment the building of the law enforcement system and 
of political and judicial personnel. In the business 
departments and grass-roots units that also are engaged in 
cracking down on lawbreaking activities in rural areas, the 
system of investigating misjudged cases should be practiced 
strictly, and cases of bending the law for the benefit of 
relatives and friends, taking bribes to pervert the law, and 
other cases in violation of law and discipline also will be 
investigated and dealt with conscientiously. 
  [Liu] The severe crackdown on serious criminals in rural 
areas is based on the law and is feasible in practice, but there 
also exist in rural areas such public security problems of 
certain people often committing minor offenses. These minor 
cases in violation of the law occur frequently and 
substantially, which is the most thorny problem for the 
government and the peasants. What measures will be adopted in 
the current centralized rectification of public order in the 
rural areas? 
  [Chen] The lawbreakers characterized by "never committing 
serious crimes, but often committing minor offenses" have 
accounted for the largest proportion of cases concerning public 
security in rural areas and have been a long-standing, major, 
and difficult problem in rural security work. In particular, 
the masses hate local ruffians and village gangsters bitterly, 
but there are no effective measures to manage and handle these 
people for lack of sound laws and regulations at present. This 
is a major cause giving rise to the rampancy of local ruffians 
and village gangsters. Therefore, we first must proceed from the 
actual conditions of China's rural society at the present stage 
so as to solve the problem. Today, in a considerable portion of 
rural areas, peasants' legal concepts are comparatively weak, 
and owing to a large number of people who are uneducated and 
ignorant of law, the mechanisms of legal work in rural areas are 
very unsound too. On the one hand, we must stress the necessity 
of handling affairs strictly in accordance with the law, conduct 
education in rural areas to publicize knowledge of the law, and 
enthusiastically guide peasants in gradually getting onto the 
track of a socialist legal system. On the other hand, under the 
precondition that the Constitution and law are not violated, we 
must adopt some special policies and measures on certain 
specific objects in light of the national conditions to make 
good the shortcomings in building the legal system at the 
present stage. 
  Some practical measures currently are being probed in quite 
a 
few localities. For example, relevant departments in some 
localities enlisted those lawbreakers who had evoked strong 
repercussions among the masses for refusing to mend their ways 
despite repeated admonition but whose offenses were not serious 
enough for criminal sanction or reeducation through labor, and 
particularly those offenders who had been released after serving 
sentences or from labor education but had recidivist tendencies, 
to study knowledge of the law with a view to helping them mend 
their bad conduct. In other localities, the authorities took 
measures to enhance assistance and education for such people by 
way of practicing a public security responsibility system under 
which village chiefs, group heads of villagers, and parents 
signed letters of responsibility to give assistance and 
education to them, and satisfactory results have been scored in 
practice. 
  [Liu] Some social security problems in rural areas have 
something to do with the laxity and incompetence of some rural 
grass-roots organizations, as well as with the failure to 
properly implement the party's principles and policies by the 
rural leading cadres at the grass-roots level. In the current 
rectification of public order in rural areas, what measures will 
you take to overhaul and strengthen lax and incompetent rural 
organizations and to establish a new rural security structure, 
apart from severely cracking down on criminal offenses? 
  [Chen] The crux of doing the current rectification work well 
lies in devoting a lot of time and energy to strengthening the 
building of party and government organizations at the township 
and village levels and of mass self-government organizations. 
  -- The civil affairs, public security, and other pertinent 
departments should jointly send capable work teams to stay in 
the townships and villages where public order is poor and the 
work foundation weak. While rectifying prominent security 
problems, they should strengthen the building of party and 
government organizations in towns and townships, as well as the 
coordinated organizations, with village party branches as the 
cores, in order to change the rural appearance within a set 
period. 
  -- A deputy secretary should be assigned in each town and 
township party committee to be responsible for the comprehensive 
management of social security so as to amplify the bodies 
leading the work. Led by the principal leading cadres of the 
party organizations, these specially assigned deputy secretaries 
will take charge of day-to-day work. In the towns and townships 
that are designated as key units for rectification or where 
conditions exist, working bodies should be set up or special 
personnel assigned to conduct work in these localities. 
  -- In the towns and townships along traffic lines or with 
complicated public security conditions, local police stations 
should be set up as quickly as possible. 
  -- Rural joint security defense forces should be reorganized 
and augmented, the quality of personnel should be enhanced, and 
their sources of outlay should be resolved. The joint defense 
of public security should be organically combined with militia 
work in a bid to fully exercise the significant role of the 
militia in maintaining public order. However, in places where 
specially formed joint security defense forces are not 
necessary, they should conduct activities such as "joint defense 
among 10 households," "voluntarily on duty during the night," 
and so on, according to the necessity of maintaining public 
security and in line with the wishes of the people. 
  -- Rural public security committees and mediatory committees 
should be strengthened. Taking as focal points those that have 
empty titles only and are in a paralyzed state, we should 
perform conscientiously the work of reorganizing these units. 
The competent departments should provide professional guidance 
and personnel training for them so that they will exploit their 
strengths more effectively. 
  -- The practice of administering villages according to the 
law should be popularized vigorously. In particular, we should 
further ascertain the responsibility for public security and 
should establish incentive and restraining mechanisms to foster 
righteousness and eliminate evils by way of formulating rules 
and regulations for villagers, and should select through 
appraisal advanced households who observe laws and regulations 
in an appropriate manner. 
  -- The work of law propaganda and education among peasants 
should be improved and enhanced. With the grass-roots 
propaganda workers -- particularly the grass-roots judicial and 
administrative departments and their personnel, as well as the 
cultural centers as mainstreams -- propaganda and legal 
education with peasant characteristics should be launched deep 
in the key villages which were designated for the current 
rectification work. 
  In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that party and 
government leaders at all levels should pay serious attention to 
rural security work. It is particularly necessary for the 
principal leading cadres at the county and township levels to 
assume command in person, coordinate with relevant departments, 
fully mobilize the masses, and wage the struggle 
conscientiously. It is necessary to take the organization of 
this struggle as a major aspect of practicing the leadership 
responsibility system on the comprehensive management of social 
security, and to link it with commendation and punishment. With 
regard to the party and government leading cadres and relevant 
officials who have not exercised effective leadership so that 
public order in their localities remains chaotic, they must be 
handled in line with the requirements of the responsibility 
system, and if necessary, the right to veto by one vote relating 
to the comprehensive management of social security should be 
exercised as well.

Qichen, a Super Diplomatic Artist"] 
  [Text] For more than four decades since the founding of 
new China, there have been several world-renowned foreign 
ministers. From that outstanding premier and foreign minister, 
Zhou Enlai, and the learned foreign minister, Marshal Chen Yi -- 
both of the first generation -- to the present moderate and 
skilled foreign minister, Qian Qichen, whose style embodies a 
vast country in the international arena. 
  Qian Qichen is not tall or big, but a bit short. He does not 
look serious, but always has a smile on his face. When 
attending meetings with leaders and diplomats of American, 
European, Asian, and African countries, however, he appears 
outstanding and attractive. In addition to the factor -- as he 
put it -- "I have a big and powerful China behind me," one very 
important point for his attractiveness is that his qualities and 
poise make up his personal charisma. 
<H5>  Secret Diplomatic Principle </H5>
  In an interview with TA KUNG PAO, he said: "As foreign 
minister, it is important for me to reflect the position and 
principles of my country. If you echo other people's views in 
everything, you will not be respected. The reason China is 
thought important by the world is that it has it own views. It 
is not all right if you play the yes-man in everything and if 
you do not have your own characteristics or qualities." 
  True, China's many views and positions have been expressed 
through the important role of the foreign minister. However, 
when he declares and elaborates on a view, position, or 
principle -- however strong and solemn it is -- it remains 
solemn and yet does not give an impression of stiffness or 
rigidity. 
  What is the reason? The secret principle is that the 
pleasant and moderately broad smiles on his face makes China's 
views appear strong inside and soft outside. He also said: The 
key to some skills is to create -- to the extent possible -- a 
lively and vivid atmosphere within the scope allowed by the 
diplomatic field. Do not repeat the same words too many times. 
There should be some new words and new meanings. 
  The coexistence of principle and flexibility embodied in 
Qian 
Qichen not only has enabled China -- despite difficulties in the 
wake of the disintegration of the Soviet Union and East Europe, 
and of "4 June" -- to open up the diplomatic field and establish 
its weight, but also has won Qian himself such titles as 
"diplomatic ballet star" and "super diplomatic artist" given by 
Western media. 
  Qian Qichen was born in Tianjin in January 1928. At the age 
of nine, he and his family moved to Shanghai. He joined the 
student movement under the CPC's leadership when he was studying 
at a middle school affiliated to Shanghai's Datong University. 
As a middle-school student at the age of 14, he joined the CPC. 
He engaged in underground work under the leadership of Qiao Shi 
and Wu Xueqian. In 1945, at 17, he assumed a post in Shanghai's 
DAGONG BAO. 
  DAGONG BAO's managerial department, where he worked, was 
located on Nanjing Road, near the Bund. It was the busiest 
district in Shanghai: People came and went; business was very 
brisk. Using this as a shield, he took part in the underground 
student movement for the party. The colleagues who worked with 
him in those days recalled that he was kind and gentle, very 
capable, easy to talk to, and on very good terms with 
colleagues, and that he led a thrifty life and wore simple 
clothes. In a photo album of old DAGONG BAO people, there is a 
photo of Qian Qichen and several other DAGONG BAO people in a 
garden. In it, Qian Qichen is wearing a long robe and a scarf; 
he looks smart. 
<H5>  Rigorous Test </H5>
  Since the founding of New China in 1949, he worked for the 
Youth League at one time. In 1954, he went to study in the 
former Soviet Union and later went to work in the Foreign 
Ministry as second secretary at the Chinese Embassy in the 
Soviet Union. During the Cultural Revolution, as the vice head 
of the foreign affairs department of the Ministry of Higher 
Learning, he was accused of being a "capitalist roader" and was 
sent to work in the 7 May Cadre School. In 1972, he was 
transferred to the Soviet Union again as counselor. In 1974, he 
became ambassador to an African country. In 1977, he frequently 
appeared in public as the head of the Information Department of 
the Foreign Ministry and as the Foreign Ministry spokesman. In 
1982, he acted as vice minister of the Foreign Ministry. In 
1988, he became the seventh foreign minister of new China. At 
the NPC session in 1991, he was named state councilor and 
foreign minister. In the 1993 NPC elections, he was named vice 
premier of the State Council and foreign minister. 
  The shakeup of the socialist camps in the Soviet Union and 
Eastern Europe in 1989, and the "4 June turmoil" in Beijing cast 
a dark cloud over China's diplomatic sky. The foreign minister, 
who had acted in that capacity for only one year, met with a 
rigorous test. 
  Faced with political isolation and economic sanctions by the 
major Western powers, he continued his fairly penetrating 
smiles, skillfully used China's huge market as an attraction, 
and carried on dialogue with and contested with the Western 
powers over "human rights" tenaciously and flexibly. Bit by 
bit, he made them break the barriers -- willingly or unwillingly 
-- and face the facts. During this period, his diplomatic skills 
were brought to light and since have attracted worldwide 
attention. 
  In an article entitled "1993: The World Comes to a New 
Understanding of China," he wrote: "In disturbances, the true 
qualities of heroes are demonstrated. Over the past few years, 
China has withstood the test of changes around the world and has 
traveled a bumpy road. China has not been overwhelmed; rather, 
it has become more stable, more developed, and more prosperous. 
These past two years have been a period in which China's 
economy has developed most rapidly, and a period of diplomatic 
expansion and development. Given the continued economic 
recession of the West, China's large market is becoming a 
reality. Its great attraction means that no country will give 
up the opportunity to enter China's market. Facts have proved 
that there are extensive common interests between China and the 
West." 
<H5>  Basic Qualities </H5>
  A clear and analytical mind, quick and relaxed responses, 
appropriately tense and relaxed manners in dealings with others 
-- these are the basic qualities of Qian Qichen, the foreign 
minister of a large country. With these, he shuttles in the 
midst of rain and storms, and wages battles of wits. Following 
the rise and strengthening of China's economy and other aspects, 
China's diplomacy is no longer Third World diplomacy. China's 
role as a major diplomatic power already has been established 
with worldwide recognition. 
  In March and April this year alone, many important heads of 
state visited China. The U.S. secretary of state, the Japanese 
prime minister, the Korean president, the French premier, the 
Portuguese premier, the Australian governor..... The new "China 
craze" has begun. 
  Naturally, Qian Qichen is extremely busy at home and abroad. 
The abovementioned visits in March and April by the heads of 
major countries, plus the visits by the heads of small countries 
and the foreign ministers of various countries made a very long 
list. 
  From this, we can imagine how busy Qian Qichen is, but he 
laughed it off and described in a light way his "activity," 
which reporters asked about. However, his secretary and the 
personnel who are around him frequently told the truth. They 
said that he begins reading a large volume of information at six 
o'clock in the morning. During the day, he has to receive and 
meet with guests, hold talks, and have meetings. At night, he 
has to review and approve documents and revise manuscripts. 
Even on Sundays, he can hardly rest. He has to read books and 
do the office work -- or the additional lessons, as he calls 
them -- he has left undone. Whenever he is out on visits, he 
always works 18 hours without stop. He works from 0600 through 
2400. His secretary, Mr. Lian, said: We all feel very tired! 
Yet he rises early in the morning feeling refreshed and full of 
vigor. He is already 66 years old now, and his vigor, 
enthusiasm, and unusual memory are all admirable. 
<H5>  His Hobbies </H5>
  Qian Qichen does not smoke cigarettes or drink. He loves 
vegetarian food. His biggest hobbies are reading and walking. 
He has a good command of Russian and English. Outdoor walking, 
of course, is good for the health, but since he is so busy and 
has no spare time for walking, he can only use the indoor 
bicycle in his home for exercise. He considers reading a kind 
of spiritual walking. He reportedly very much likes reading 
politics, history, biographies, commentaries on current affairs, 
and some other essays. As he is so busy with his work, he has 
had to give up his other hobbies, such as photography, 
calligraphy, stamp collecting, and swimming. 
  Moreover, Qian Qichen has more concern for and a better 
understanding of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong issue than ordinary 
people. This is naturally related to his positions as foreign 
minister and chairman of the Preliminary Work Committee. 
Speaking on the Hong Kong issue, he appears to have a good 
knowledge of many people and things. He appears to have more 
concern for and a better knowledge of Hong Kong media 
particularly. He summed up the characteristics of Hong Kong 
media with rather humorous and popular phrases, making it easy 
for us to discern his special qualities as one who once worked 
for the press. 
  Qian Qichen has given us consistently good impressions. His 
diplomatic capability has been recognized unanimously the world 
over. His personal character wins good appraisals both at home 
and abroad. He behaves in a moderate and appropriate manner on 
diplomatic occasions. He is neither haughty nor humble. Even 
when dealing with his diplomatic counterparts, he talks 
cheerfully and calmly, making them convinced. 
  On 29 September 1993, after delivering a general speech in a 
UN General Assembly debate, the representatives of a dozen 
countries or more went before the seat of the Chinese 
representative and shook hands with him and sent him 
congratulations in violation of the chairman's earlier request 
that they must not send congratulations in the session hall. On 
public occasions at home, he appears amiable and kind, and does 
not put on airs, thus winning the respect of ordinary people 
from the bottom of their hearts. 
  Last year, this author participated in a celebration to mark 
the 10th anniversary of the publication of SHIJIE ZHISHI, a 
magazine run by the foreign ministry. He learned beforehand 
that Qian Qichen had asked that no gifts or certificates be sent 
to the celebration. When Qian Qichen arrived, he apologized to 
the large number of reporters present at the celebration and 
said smilingly: "Today, I have kept you busy. All I can do is 
to invite all of you to some tea...." We should know that it 
was popular to send gifts to news briefings in those days. For 
this reason, the reporters did not grumble against him, but 
appraised him in a praising tone. 
  In the NPC elections in 1993, Qian Qichen again was 
nominated 
as vice premier and foreign minister, and was elected with the 
most votes. This became good talk at home and abroad for some 
time. It is not difficult, therefore, to see on what Qian 
Qichen relies for the high appraisal and the many votes. 
  Qian Qichen has a happy and harmonious family. He married 
Zhou Hanqiong on 31 December 1952. They have one son and one 
daughter. Zhou also works in the Foreign Ministry. Their 
children are grown up and have their own children, as well. 
Nothing is more pleasant to Qian Qichen than playing with his 
grandchildren in his leisure time.

"China Sternly Cracks Down on Pirated Compact Discs"] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 10 Jun (WEN WEI PO)--In recent years, 
more and more pirated audio and video tapes and compact discs 
(CDs) have emerged in the domestic audio visual market and have 
spread to the international market. This phenomenon is becoming 
rampant. In particular, pirated CDs earn great profits so their 
numbers are on the rise and this adversely affects the 
law-abiding audio visual producers within the country. More 
importantly, they have infringed upon the intellectual property 
rights of the original composers and producers and caused 
grievance in the international community. Regarding these 
serious lawbreaking actions, the Chinese Government has always 
strictly banned such actions and has organized many campaigns to 
crack down on it. However, it still exists despite the efforts 
to ban it. 
<H5>  CD Production Lines Uncontrolled </H5>
  What is the reason? Lu Lu, the person in charge of the 
Shanghai Municipal Audio Visual Management Office, offered an 
analysis: First, CD production lines are seriously uncontrolled 
and this is the "source" of illegal pirated CDs. According to 
statistics, the whole country now has some 30 CD production 
lines, mostly situated in Guangdong Province. Based on the 
calculation that each CD production line produces 3 to 3.5 
million CDs each year, these production lines produce a total of 
100 million CDs every year. The whole country now has some 200 
registered publishing units but they do not produce many 
programs and they require only about one-tenth of the 
abovementioned supply of CDs. Consequently, many manufacturers 
do not have sufficient work to fill production capacity. Many 
CD production lines are established joint-venture style and, 
when the contracts are signed, most foreign parties promise to 
fulfill a certain production capacity. Under the condition that 
the normal channels cannot satisfy their needs, factories 
acquire pirated CDs from abroad in order to survive and these 
products are being sold in the domestic market while some have 
spread to the international market. 
  The reason for this uncontrolled situation regarding CD 
production lines is, according to analysis, because the audio 
visual management departments in some localities have different 
units implementing different policies and many departments have 
the power to approve the establishment of CD production lines. 
With approval being granted by different departments, plus the 
lack of consideration for overall demand, there are more 
production lines than needed. Second, proceeding from local 
interests, the local departments in charge of examination and 
approval duplicate the production lines. 
<H5>  Pirated Products Earn Great Profits </H5>
  The second reason for the rampant pirated CD situation is 
that producing and selling pirated CDs can earn great profits. 
According to information, the lowest profit rate is 100 
percent. At the same time, speaking theoretically, the fidelity 
of pirated CDs is nearly 100 percent. The production costs of 
pirated CDs are low and their selling prices are low, so they 
are acceptable to the consumers in the country and they have 
their market foundation. 
  In addition, as a distributor who legally imports CDs, China 
National Publications Import and Export Corporation cannot 
compete with those who sell pirated CDs because of the tariff 
(the tax rate for CDs containing popular songs is 120 percent 
and the tax rate for general CDs is 40 percent). In the market, 
the price for a pirated CD can be as low as 15 or 16 yuan, while 
the original CD imported by China National Publications Import 
and Export Corporation has a price tag of 100 yuan or more. 
  Apart from the abovementioned reasons, lax management of the 
audio visual market in the country is also a main reason. 
<H5>  Manage the Audio Visual Market According to Law </H5>
  How can we check pirated CDs? Lu Lu thinks that the crux is 
to control the "source" -- the number of production lines. He 
said that the central authorities have already shown 
determination in this regard. At the same time, he called for a 
great decrease in tariff for original CDs, to enable the lawful 
operators to compete in the market. In addition, management of 
the audio visual market should be strengthened. 
  Shanghai, as the city with the best management of the audio 
visual market in the country, has already promulgated the 
country's first set of audio visual management regulations -- 
Shanghai Municipality Audio Visual Market Management Procedure, 
to manage the market according to law. Beginning 1 July 1994, 
the municipality will thoroughly examine the current 1,200 audio 
visual products stalls and then issue them with permits and 
qualification certificates so that they can operate. The 
relevant department will strictly manage the source of CDs in 
wholesale units; encourage the establishment of business points; 
organize classes for people in the trade to teach them the 
relevant regulations and ethics and improve their quality; and 
will establish a mechanism to ban pirated CDs and bring 
prosperity to Shanghai's audio visual market.

<F P=106> [By Zhang Yuan: "State Opens The Door for More Foreign Law </F>
Offices"] 
  [Text] The number of foreign law firms allowed to open 
offices in China will be more than doubled within the next two 
years, a Ministry of Justice official said yesterday. 
  Pending approval of the State Council, up to 100 foreign law 
firms will be allowed to set up branches in the country, up from 
the present 41, according to Du Guoxing, deputy director of the 
lawyers' administration department with the ministry. 
  Foreign law firms will also be allowed to open in more 
coastal cities and provincial capitals than just the current 
five cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and 
Haikou, Du noted. 
  Du made the announcement at a seminar yesterday on China's 
first Foreign Trade Law, which takes effect July 1. 
  The seminar was co-sponsored by the International Business 
newspaper and the APC Law Firm, both based in Beijing. 
  Attending the seminar were more than 20 law experts, 
managers 
and officials, including senior officials from the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. 
  Due to China's rapid economic growth and rising business 
opportunities, more foreign law firms have applied for 
permission to enter the potentially huge Chinese market. 
  So far, about 80 foreign law firms have applied with the 
Ministry of Justice to open offices in the mainland. They must 
also register with the State Administration for Industry and 
Commerce. 
  The country first allowed foreign law firms to set up 
branches in the mainland on an experimental basis in July 1992. 
  Experience has shown that the experiment is a success, said 
Du, adding that the overseas law firms play an active role in 
helping more foreign investors enter the Chinese market, 
promoting Sino-foreign cooperation and training Chinese lawyers. 
  An Australian law firm office, for instance, helped 
introduce 
nearly 30 foreign investment projects to China in just one year. 
  Meanwhile, China will also encourage more Chinese law firms 
to open offices abroad. At present, there are only two Chinese 
law firms that have opened offices abroad, Du said.

  [Text] Beijing, June 17 (XINHUA) -- China's Supreme 
People's Procuratorate (SPP) issued a provisional regulation 
here today to protect and reward people who report cases of 
graft and bribery, leading to successful prosecutions. 
  It has already been decided to give rewards ranging from 
3,000 yuan to 30,000 yuan under these regulations to some 13 
informers for the information on such evil-doers which they gave 
to the procuratorates, said Zhao Dengju, an SPP deputy 
procurator. 
  "Exposure by means of letters, telephone or interviews by 
the 
masses has played a key role in China's drive against the 
corrupt practices," Zhao told a news conference here today. 
  Some 80 percent of all the corruption cases on the 
procuratorial file for investigation and prosecution were traced 
on the basis of clues reported by the masses, he said. 
  Since the beginning of the current anti-corruption drive, 
the 
procuratorates nationwide have accepted and heard 230,000 such 
cases, of which 170,000 were corruption cases, he said, adding 
that they accepted and heard 1.69 million reported cases since 
1988, of which 1.22 million were related to corruption. 
  The provisional regulation stipulates that an informer will 
be rewarded based on the role his information plays in cracking 
the case, or his contribution in helping the judicial bodies, 
and the illicit money or goods recovered. 
  To protect the informer from revenge, the regulation states 
that information about the informer will not be disclosed 
without his or her own permission. 
  The SPP official said the 13 rewarded informers had helped 
to 
uncover 11 major and important corruption cases, and recover 18 
million yuan worth of illicit money and goods. 
  Their rewards will total 119,000 yuan, he said. 
  The provisional regulation going into effect today is 
expected to help further the country's anti-corruption drive, 
Zhao said.

<F P=106> [Article by Lu Yu-sha (7627 6276 2619) from Beijing: </F>
"Tension in Spring--Utmost `Solicitude' Is Shown for National 
Churches"] 
  [Text] April, May, and June every year are the spring 
season for blossoms in Beijing. However, Beijing's political 
atmosphere seems like winter during this period. This is 
particularly true now as this year marks the fifth anniversary 
of the 4 June incident. While being highhanded with the 
democratic, worker, and student movements as these days 
approach, the authorities are also showing their special 
"solicitude" toward "some other people." 
  For example, the authorities recently issued a circular, 
calling for precautions against national level churches formed 
by all kinds of religious organizations. The circular also 
prohibited ties between these churches and their counterparts 
abroad. 
<H5>  Churches Must Not Develop Ties With Foreigners </H5>
  The State Council's Religion Bureau recently held a national 
conference in Beijing for chiefs of bureaus in charge of 
religion work. In light of the spirit of the speech made by 
Jiang Zemin at the National United Front Work Meeting, the 
conference initially laid down the principle of offering 
"classified guidance" to different religious groups. The 
principle for different religious sects is to prevent the 
establishment of a national religious organization and its ties 
with foreign organizations. 
<H5>  Buddhist and Taoist Organizations May Not Indiscriminately </H5>
Receive New Members 
  Regarding Buddhism and Taoism, the present task is to 
support 
and help Buddhist and Taoist organizations at all levels to 
strengthen their building, improve the quality of the monks, and 
exercise proper management over existing monasteries. The 
circular says: "Measures must be adopted to resolutely check 
practices of indiscriminate preaching of monastic disciplines 
and recruiting new members." Statutory procedures should be 
undergone to build monasteries and no monastery may be built 
without approval. In places which hold regular religious 
activities in small rural temples, it is necessary to strengthen 
management and let them open the temples to disciples after 
undergoing registration procedures. 
<H5>  Guard Against Islamic Interference in State Policies </H5>
  Regarding Islam, it is necessary to guard against its 
interference in the state's policies. The circular reiterated 
that they cannot meddle in the state's administrative, judicial, 
education, and marriage systems and may not restore the 
abolished feudal privileges and the exploitation system. The 
"Haiji Monastery," "imam [a hong 7093 6059]," and "jaiz [re yi 
si 3583 0181 2448]" must not be allowed to resume. Moreover, it 
is necessary to step up management of the Islamic monasteries, 
rectify and improve the "ahung [7093 6059]" and "imam day [yi ma 
ri 0122 3854 2480]" management system. Furthermore, it is 
necessary to positively and steadily resolve the contradictions 
and disputes between and within the sects and adopt forceful 
measures to stop the violent conflicts. 
<H5>  Step Up the Handling of Underground Catholic Forces </H5>
  Regarding Catholic work, the stress should be put on 
reforming the rites and gradually introducing mass in Chinese. 
It is necessary to further implement the policies on churches 
and premises and create conditions for normal religious 
activities. Shortages of bishops and clergymen is an 
outstanding question. Training should be given to those who are 
politically competent. If the question cannot be resolved 
temporarily, the responsible bishop can concurrently take up the 
job. Efforts should be stepped up in comprehensively handling 
the underground Catholic forces. Measures should be adopted to 
promptly dissolve the already established organizations. As 
regards the organizations which have not yet taken shape, it is 
necessary to take precautions and not allow them to develop. 
Moreover, the establishment of a national center for 
Catholicism will not be allowed. 
  Regarding Christianity, the religious departments should 
tackle the "thorny issues" together with the Christian 
organizations at all levels, namely, individuals proclaiming 
themselves missionaries, the establishment of private meeting 
places, and the question of minority religious sects. 
<H5>  Family Gatherings Not To Be Seen as Private Gatherings </H5>
  He who proclaims himself a missionary, who openly opposes 
the 
socialist system and government leadership, who publicize 
extremism, and who disseminates heretical beliefs shall be 
punished according to law. Measures should be adopted to check 
missionary work done by those unqualified to preach or who are 
not even disciples. 
  As regards the private meeting places set up directly by 
those who proclaim themselves missionaries or under their 
influence, and the gathering of some disciples who have 
separated themselves from the open religious establishments for 
various reasons and formed their own organizations, they shall 
be banned if involved in illegal activities. If their 
activities are normal, they can undergo registration. Some 
should be guided to participate in religious activities at the 
registered establishments. The traditional Christian family 
gathering should not be regarded as a private gathering. 
Nevertheless, the family gatherings should be replaced by 
churches and these people should be associated through the 
registered churches. 
<H5>  No National Level Organizations Should Be Established </H5>
  On the question of Christian sects, it is necessary to 
uphold 
association, seek common ground while reserving differences, and 
strengthen unity. Some localities with a large number of sects 
and disciples may be allowed to set up churches in places where 
conditions permit. However, no sect will be allowed to resume 
or establish national or regional organizations; nor will it be 
allowed to resume or establish ties with the religious 
organizations abroad. The organizations of the new sects 
introduced from abroad or established domestically of their own 
accord will be regarded as illegal organizations in light of 
relevant Chinese regulations.

<F P=106> [By reporter Sun Yong (1327 0516)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Jun (XINHUA) -- A meeting to mark the 
70th founding anniversary of the Huangpu [Whampoa] Military 
Academy and the 10th founding anniversary of the Huangpu 
Military Academy Alumni Association took place at the Great Hall 
of the People this afternoon. 
  The message inscribed by Jiang Zemin for the occasion reads: 
"Carry forward Huangpu's patriotic and revolutionary spirit in 
expediting the motherland's peaceful reunification." Liu 
Huaqing's inscribed message reads: "Greetings to the 70th 
founding anniversary of the Huangpu Military Academy. Carry 
forward the Huangpu spirit in expediting the motherland's 
reunification." 
  Li Peng, Hu Jintao, Qian Qichen, Zhang Zhen, Qin Jiwei, 
Cheng 
Siyuan, Li Peiyao, Yang Rudai, Wang Zhaoguo, Ngapoi Ngawang 
Jigmei, Sepydin Aza, Hong Xuezhi, Wang Guoquan and others 
attended the commemorations, or had their picture taken with 
representatives of the military academy's alumni prior to the 
commemorations. 
  Li Ruihuan addressed the meeting. He began his speech by 
extending the CPC Central Committee's warm greetings and sincere 
regards to the alumni as well as all the academy's teachers and 
cadets at home and abroad. Li Ruihuan said: Huangpu Military 
Academy was founded 70 years ago by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and Chinese 
communists represented by Zhou Enlai. Now 70 years have gone by 
and the Chinese people led by the CPC and Comrade Mao Zedong 
have accomplished the democratic revolution, which Dr. Sun 
Yat-sen did not accomplish, and developed this revolution into a 
socialist revolution. Achieving our motherland's peaceful 
reunification accords with the will of the people, it is what 
our nation wants, and it is also a sacred mission for Chinese 
people of all nationalities, including our countrymen in Taiwan. 
I hope Huangpu alumni on the two sides of the Strait will unite 
and contribute more to our motherland's reunification and 
China's revitalization. (full text of the speech will be 
transmitted separately) 
  Addressing the commemoration meeting, Li Moan, vice 
president 
of the Huangpu Military Academy Alumni Association, said: In 
the past we joined the whole nation in fighting the big powers 
and eliminating the warlords. Earthshaking changes have now 
taken place in our great motherland, and people throughout the 
country are advancing triumphantly under the guidance of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. Since its founding 10 years ago, the Huangpu 
Military Academy Alumni Association has been making unswerving 
efforts to foster the academy's spirit, establish ties with 
alumni, promote the motherland's reunification, and to dedicate 
itself to revitalizing China. Our association has already 
established contacts with nearly 1,000 alumni in Taiwan as well 
as alumni in more than 10 countries and regions. When 
contacting alumni in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, and overseas 
areas, our association has seized every opportunity to expound 
the nation's policy toward Taiwan -- a policy characterized by 
"peaceful reunification; and one country, two systems." We have 
also done many things useful for the introduction of capital, 
technology, and proficient personnel; and for promoting the 
development of relations and exchanges between the two sides of 
the strait. 
  Zhou Lejun, a Huangpu alumnus from Taiwan, also addressed 
the 
occasion. He said: The meritorious services which Huangpu 
alumni performed during the eastern and northern expeditions and 
the War of Resistance Against Japan have gone down in history. 
We are pleased to note the exchanges between alumni on the two 
sides of the strait. We should broaden our vision and, as 
brothers, we should by no means be engaged in quarrel. We are 
absolutely against separation; even more so are we against 
intervention by foreign forces and the obstruction of our great 
motherland's reunification. I hope Huangpu alumni will work 
hard together so that the great cause of reunification can be 
achieved at an early date. 
  The commemoration meeting was called by the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee. 
Ye Xuanping, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, 
chaired the meeting, which was attended by Huangpu alumni at 
home and from abroad and people of all walks of life in Beijing 
-- more than 500 in total. 
  In the evening, the CPPCC National Committee and the CPC 
Central Committee United Front Department hosted a banquet at 
the Great Hall of the People to mark the 70th founding 
anniversary of the Huangpu Military Academy and the 10th 
anniversary of the Huangpu Military Academy Alumni Association. 
Wang Zhaoguo delivered a toast at the banquet.

<F P=106> [Speech by Li Ruihuan at a meeting commemorating the 70th </F>
founding anniversary of the Huangpu (Whampoa) Military Academy 
and the 10th founding anniversary of the Huangpu Alumni 
Association on 16 June 1994] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Jun (XINHUA) -- Friends and comrades: 
  Today alumni of the Huangpu Military Academy at home and 
from 
abroad happily gather here to commemorate the academy's 70th 
founding anniversary and the Huangpu Alumni Association's 10th 
founding anniversary. On behalf of the CPC Central Committee, I 
extend warm congratulations and sincere greetings to all Huangpu 
alumni who are present today and through you, to all the 
academy's teachers and cadets at home and abroad. 
  Seven decades ago, Dr. Sun Yat-sen -- the great patriot and 
pioneer of the democratic revolution in China -- summarized 
bitter the experience of repeated setbacks in the pursuit of 
national independence, freedom and democracy, and the people's 
happiness; resolutely reshuffled the Kuomintang [KMT]; and, with 
the support and assistance of the Comintern and the CPC, put 
forward the three major policies on "alliance with Russia and 
the Communists, and assistance to peasants and workers," thereby 
effecting the first cooperation between the KMT and the CPC. In 
order to set up a revolutionary army and use armed revolutionary 
forces to fight against armed counterrevolutionary forces, Dr. 
Sun Yat-sen, together with the Chinese Communists, represented 
by Zhou Enlai, jointly founded the Huangpu Military Academy. 
Imbued with the aspiration of serving the country, ardent young 
people from various parts of the country congregated at 
"revolutionary Huangpu," and one after another groups of 
revolutionary soldiers grew to maturity at the academy, becoming 
the backbone of the Northern Expedition. Noble-minded Huangpu 
cadets from both KMT and CPC waged a bloodbath battle side by 
side to "topple imperialist powers and eliminate warlords," 
thereby defeating the northern reactionary warlords. After the 
Japanese imperialists launched an all-out war of aggression 
against China, which put the Chinese nation at a critical 
juncture between life or death, the KMT and the CPC -- under the 
CPC-sponsored great banner of national united front against 
Japan -- cooperated once again and fought against Japan, thereby 
winning the great victory over foreign aggression. We shall 
forever cherish the memory of those Huangpu martyrs who made 
important contributions to repelling aggressors and safeguarding 
national independence. 
  Seventy years have passed. The CPC and Comrade Mao Zedong 
led the Chinese people in accomplishing the democratic 
revolution, which Dr. Sun Yat-sen did not accomplish; and 
developed it into a socialist revolution. Earthshaking changes 
have taken place on the great earth of the motherland. The 
Chinese nation now stands erect in the east of the world and 
enjoys high esteem in the international community. Today China 
sees vigorous development in all fields of endeavor, and enjoys 
economic prosperity, political stability, national unity, and 
social progress. Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and led by the 
CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, the 
Chinese people are seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, 
and opening up wider; and the magnificent ideal of building a 
prosperous, democratic, civilized modern socialist power is 
being gradually transformed into a reality through the great 
efforts of the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation working 
hard in a pioneering spirit. 
  Achieving the motherland's peaceful reunification accords 
with the aspirations of the people and the demand of the nation; 
and it is the sacred mission of the Chinese people of all 
nationalities, including the compatriots in Taiwan. We shall 
continue to promote the cause of peaceful reunification under 
the concept of "one country, two systems." We have time and 
again stated our view that endorsing reunification means loving 
the country; and that differences existing between the two sides 
of the strait can be gradually resolved through increasing 
contacts and consultations under the principle of one China. 
Our stand has been praised and endorsed by farsighted people 
everywhere. We hope that the Taiwan authorities will weigh 
national interests above anything else and take practical 
measures to join us in accomplishing the great cause of 
motherland reunification. 
  Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said: "In reunification lies the hope 
of all countrymen who will enjoy happiness when reunification is 
realized. Failure to accomplish reunification will bring us 
suffering." The late Marshals Xu Xiangqign and Nie Rongzhen 
said in January 1990: "As the motherland has yet to be 
reunified, the alumni need to continue to exert themselves." 
The Huangpu Alumni Association has done tremendous work in 
promoting exchanges and contacts between the two sides of the 
strait in the last 10 years since its founding. We hope that 
you will redouble efforts to score even greater successes in the 
work. May Huangpu alumni on both sides of the strait unite and 
contribute more to the reunification of the motherland and the 
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

gathered here today to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding 
of the influential Huangpu Military Academy. 
  The gathering also marked the 10th anniversary of the 
Huangpu 
Military Academy Alumni Association. 
  Both Chinese president and chairman of the Central Military 
Commission, Jiang Zemin, and vice-chairman of the Central 
Military Commission, Liu Huaqing, calligraphed inscriptions of 
greetings for the anniversaries. 
  Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the 
Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said at the 
gathering that he hoped all alumni across the Taiwan Strait 
would unite for the reunification of the motherland and the 
revitalization of China. 
  Li, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political 
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, said 
that the reunification of the motherland is the common wish and 
sacred duty of the people of all nationalities in China, 
including the Taiwan compatriots. 
  Premier Li Peng and several other senior Chinese leaders, 
met 
the people attending today's gathering. 
  Huangpu (Whampoa) Military Academy, which was established in 
1924 by Dr. Sun Yat-sen at Huangpu near Guangzhou, was a 
training school for officers of the national revolutionary army 
during China's first revolutionary civil war (1924-1927). 
  Li Moan, vice-president of the Huangpu Military Academy 
Alumni Association, urged all who had attended the academy to be 
united under the banner of patriotism and to carry out the 
wishes of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and other revolutionary martyrs.

  [Text] Beijing's publication yesterday of a white paper on 
intellectual property protection has been dismissed as a 
whitewash. XINHUA, the official China news agency, yesterday 
announced the publication of the white paper-just two weeks 
ahead of a United States deadline, after which China faces a 
Special 301 investigation and possible trade sanctions. The 
Business Software Alliance (BSA) fears the white paper is merely 
propaganda and has urged the U.S. to go ahead with its Special 
301 action. 
  The white paper concentrates on underlining the measures 
Beijing has already taken to protect copyright on the mainland. 
It also admits that education is needed because "some portions 
of the population, have a rather incomplete understanding of 
intellectual property rights". The paper also said mainland 
authorities were encouraging "invention and other forms of 
creation" to alleviate the need to pirate goods. 
  However, the BSA and an official from the Hong Kong 
government's Intellectual Property Department both said 
yesterday the mainland authorities were slow to take up offers 
of advice on how to implement the laws or educate the 
population. Vice-president of the BSA Stephanie Mitchell, said 
the Chinese were insincere in their attempts to stamp out 
piracy, and that the BSA had offered Chinese officials and 
judges training, in how to recognise and deal with copyright 
infringement. There was also a BSA offer of technical 
assistance on how to prove, for example, a software program is 
pirated, she said. The offers were first made some months ago 
and have been repeated on an "on going basis". 
  As yet there had been no response from the Chinese side, Ms 
Mitchell said. There had been no tangible progress in cutting 
piracy on the mainland despite the passing of the new 
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), Ms Mitchell said. Recent 
raids on shops selling counterfeit goods were orchestrated by 
the propaganda division of the Chinese Communist Party, she 
claimed. It was "disheartening" that the judiciary and 
government IPR departments were still failing to deal with the 
problem, Ms Mitchell said. Beijing had also failed to come up 
with any prosecutions for any of the cases filed by the BSA with 
the state Intellectual Property Tribunal, she said: "They have 
been terribly slow in processing the cases. We have seen no 
practical results." 
  The number of cases of copyright infringement continues 
unabated despite high profile raids on some shops.

<F P=106> [By reporters Yang Zhaobo (2799 0340 3134) and Guo Xiaolan </F>
(6753 1420 5695)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Jun (XINHUA) -- The information office 
of the State Council today released a white paper entitled 
"Intellectual Property Protection in China." Song Jian, state 
councillor and concurrently minister in charge of the State 
Science and Technology Commission, issued a statement here on 
the purposes and significance of the white paper and on China's 
basic stand on the protection of intellectual property rights 
[IPR]. 
  Song Jian said: The IPR system is an important legal system 
for the protection of scientific, technological, cultural, and 
artistic achievements. It is also one of the conditions for an 
environment for the development of international scientific and 
technological, economic, and cultural cooperation and exchanges. 
China's Law on Scientific and Technological Progress declares 
"the state and society respect knowledge, trained personnel, and 
creative labor by scientists and technicians, and protect IPR." 
The information office of the State Council released the 
Intellectual Property Protection in China White Paper, which 
systematically introduces China's IPR legislation and law 
enforcement and expounds the Chinese Government's guiding 
ideology for improving IPR protection, in order to enable the 
international community to have a full understanding of the 
basic condition of IPR protection in China as well as the 
principled stand taken by China, the international obligations 
it has undertaken, and the important measures it has adopted, 
and in order to further foster a legal consciousness of IPR 
protection among the public. Its release will surely play a 
positive role in further improving IPR protection in China. 
  Song Jian pointed out: China's basic stand on IPR protection 
may be summed up as follows. First, China treats IPR protection 
as an important integral part of the policy on reform and 
opening up and of the socialist laws and regulations; speeds up 
the pace of legislation on IPR; and gradually perfects the 
relevant legal system. Second, China takes the road of 
internationalization in respect to the scope and level of its 
protection, and strives to conform to international standards. 
Third, China further strengthens supervision over law 
enforcement to ensure that various IPR legal systems are 
practically implemented. Based on this stand, China has 
attached great importance to IPR legislation since the 
implementation of its reform and opening up policies in order to 
accelerate modernization, the establishment of a socialist 
market economic system, and convergence with world standards. 
China joined the World Intellectual Property Organization in 
1980 and, after that, successively formulated a series of IPR 
protection laws and regulations, including the trademark law, 
patent law, general rule on civil law, technological contract 
law, copyright law, regulations on protecting computer software, 
law on unfair competition, and so forth. Especially after the 
1990's, China revised the patent law and trademark law to keep 
abreast of the international IPR protection trend, and to enable 
China's IPR system to completely converge with international 
standards. With regard to copyright protection, China's 
copyright law and the regulations for its implementation 
specifically stipulate the protection for writers' copyright as 
well as their relevant rights and interests, and incorporate 
computer software in the scope of copyright protection. After 
China joined the relevant international conventions, the State 
Council promulgated the "Provisions on the Implementation of 
International Copyright Treaties" in September 1992 to provide 
specific stipulations on the protection of the rights to which 
foreign copyright owners are entitled in accordance with 
international treaties. We have every reason to say that China 
has basically established an IPR legal system and, furthermore, 
has reached the international standard in respect of the scope 
and level of its protection. Of course, by this we do not mean 
to say that China's IPR legislation is perfect. We shall 
further amplify laws and regulations. According to the plans 
drawn up by the National People's Congress Standing Committee 
and the State Council, we shall pay close attention to 
formulating a law on protecting commercial secrets, a law on 
turning scientific and technological achievements to production, 
regulations on integrated circuit protection, regulations on 
protecting new species of plants, and so forth in the near 
future. I believe China will surely become one of the countries 
which has established a complete IPR protection system. 
  Song Jian said: The principles of China's legal system 
are "formulating enforceable laws, prosecuting cases according 
to law, enforcing the law strictly, and investigating and 
prosecuting any illegal activities." China has not only 
formulated an entire set of laws and regulations to protect 
intellectual property rights, but has also adopted a serious and 
impartial attitude while enforcing these laws and regulations. 
Moreover, China has scored marked progress in this field. In 
light of the professional nature of judicial work dealing with 
intellectual property rights, people's courts in Beijing, 
Shanghai, Guangdong, Hainan, and Fujian set up special courts 
for intellectual property rights cases in order to have high 
quality judicial personnel to specially try these cases. 
Recently, China's copyrights administrative organs cooperated 
with relevant administrative and judicial organs in 
investigating and prosecuting illegal duplication and selling of 
audio and video recordings in some regions, and cracking down on 
production of pirated audio and video recordings, thereby making 
great progress in this field. However, we should realize that 
some enterprises and individuals are still indifferent to laws 
concerning intellectual property rights, infringement of 
intellectual property rights occurs every now and then, some 
serious infringements of laws are still taking place in some 
areas, and punishment for acts in violation of intellectual 
property rights laws should be more severe. The Chinese 
Government is determined and able to solve this problem. 
  In conclusion, Song Jian pointed out: There are no 
boundaries to science and technology. As China sets up and 
perfects its intellectual property rights system, it is becoming 
an important member of the international community that protects 
intellectual property rights. While China is establishing and 
perfecting its intellectual property rights laws, it will 
earnestly fulfill its international obligations, comply with 
international standards of intellectual property rights 
protection, and play its role in international cooperation.

  [Text] Beijing, 16 Jun (XINHUA) -- The State Council 
Information Office today issued a white paper entitled 
"Intellectual Property Rights [IPR] Protection in China." The 
white paper offers a detailed explanation of China's basic 
position on the protection of IPR, a systematic account of 
legislation and law enforcement with regard to IPR, and the 
positive efforts it has made in undertaking international 
obligations in regard to protecting IPR. The white paper is 
divided into three parts and contains about 12,000 characters. 
  The white paper points out in its foreword: As a whole, 
China, for a variety of historical reasons, began work on its 
IPR protection system at a comparatively late date. After China 
started reform and opening up to the outside world, it 
accelerated the process of establishing an IPR protection system 
to rapidly develop social productive forces, promote overall 
social progress, meet the needs of developing a socialist market 
economy, and expedite China's entry into the world economy. 
Since the end of the seventies, China has done a tremendous 
amount of effective work in this field, covering in a little 
more than a dozen years a distance that took other developed 
countries scores of years, even 100 years, establishing a 
relatively comprehensive legal system for IPR protection, 
thereby attracting worldwide attention for its achievements not 
only in establishing the system but also in enforcement. 
  The white paper's first part elaborates on China's basic 
position regarding IPR protection. It points out: It is the 
Chinese Government's view that the intellectual property 
protection system plays a significant role in promoting progress 
in science and technology, enriching culture, and developing the 
economy. It functions both as an important institution ensuring 
the normal running of the socialist market economy and as one of 
the basic environments and conditions for conducting 
international exchange and cooperation in science and 
technology, economics, and culture. China considers the 
protection of intellectual property an important part of its 
policy of reform and opening up to the outside world and of the 
building of its socialist legal system. Beginning in the late 
seventies, China has been formulating laws and regulations for 
IPR protection, and has been actively participating in 
activities organized by relevant international organizations 
aimed at strengthening international exchange and cooperation in 
the IPR field. From its inception, China's IPR protection 
system was directed toward the world and geared to high 
international standards. Spurred on by its reform and opening 
up, China has carried on its intellectual property protection 
legislation at a speed never before known. 
  After starting reform and opening up to the outside world, 
China has enacted several laws for the protection of IPR, 
including "the PRC Trademark Law," "the PRC Patent Law," "the 
PRC Copyright Law," and "the PRC Law on Combating Unfair 
Competition." It has also actively participated in activities 
sponsored by the World Intellectual Property Organization [WIPO] 
and other relevant international organizations. It has become a 
WIPO member, the "Paris Convention for the Protection of 
Industrial Property Rights," the "Madrid Agreement for the 
International Registration of Trademarks," the "Berne Convention 
for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works," the 
"Universal Copyright Convention," the "Convention for the 
Protection of Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized 
Duplication of Their Phonograms," and the "Patent Cooperation 
Treaty." China was among the first signatory states of the 
"Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated 
Circuits." China has consciously sought to fulfill its 
international obligation in IPR protection, endeavoring to bring 
its intellectual property protection level near the new 
international standards, and has taken many major measures to 
further raise its current level of IPR protection. Dr. Arpad 
Bogsch, WIPO director general, pointed out that "China has 
accomplished all this at a speed unmatched in the history of 
intellectual property protection." 
  The white paper points out: While improving its legal 
system, earnestly enforcing the laws, and striking relentless 
blows at infringements and other unlawful practices, China has 
spared no effort in publicizing and providing education about 
the intellectual property protection legal system and in 
accelerating the training of professional personnel in this 
field. The fact that there has been an increasing number of 
cases involving IPR in recent years and that these cases have 
been remedied through recourse to law reflects the people's 
heightened awareness and the wide spread of IPR knowledge 
throughout society. 
  The white paper's second part elaborates on China's legal 
system for intellectual property protection. In accordance with 
its national conditions and current tendencies in international 
development, China has formulated and fine-tuned various laws 
and regulations on intellectual property protection, thereby 
constructing a socialist legal system for intellectual property 
protection with Chinese characteristics. The scope of the IPR 
protected in China and the degree of protection afforded have 
gradually conformed with international practices and a high 
degree of legal protection for IPR has been realized. 
  Effective March 1983, the "PRC Trademark Law" and the rules 
for its implementation set forth the principles of application, 
examination, and registration in trademark registration 
procedures that are entirely identical with common international 
principles. In 1993, China revised both its Trademark Law and 
the rules for its implementation to expand the range of 
trademarks protected. Regulations on commodity trademarks were 
joined by those on the registration and management of service 
trademarks; in examination as to form, a revision procedure was 
added; and in examination as to substance, a written comment 
system was established to provide convenience for registered 
trademark applicants. All these regulations coincide completely 
with the requirements of GATT's Agreement on Trade-Related 
Aspects of Intellectual Property. In addition, the State 
Administration for Industry and Commerce has issued a series of 
regulations including the Regulations on the "Administration of 
the Printing of Trademarks" and the "Procedures for Filing 
License Contracts for the Use of Trademarks." In February 1993, 
the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee adopted 
the "Supplementary Regulations on Punishing Criminal 
Counterfeiting of Registered Trademarks" to further intensify 
punishment for such counterfeiting and other infringements. 
These laws and regulations fully and effectively guarantee the 
right to the exclusive use of Chinese and foreign registered 
trademarks. 
  "The PRC Patent Law" and the rules for its implementation 
came into effect in April 1985, expanding the scope of 
intellectual property protection in China to include inventions 
and other new creations. To bring the level of China's patent 
protection closer to international standards, the NPC Standing 
Committee adopted an amendment to the Patent Law on 4 September 
1992, which included important revisions. The revised Patent 
Law expands the scope of patent protection: patents may be 
granted to all types of technological inventions, whether new 
products or new techniques, including pharmaceutical products 
and substances obtained by means of a chemical process, foods, 
beverages and flavorings; an invention patent's duration has 
been extended from 15 years from the date of application to 20 
years; the duration of utility model patents and of exterior 
design patents has been extended from five years from the date 
of application to 10 years; and the protection of patent rights 
has been further strengthened. In addition to extending the 
protection of a patented process to include products directly 
produced by that process, the law clearly stipulates that the 
importation of patented products requires the patent holder's 
permission; and conditions for imposing compulsory patent 
license were restipulated. These measures mark the reaching of 
a new level of patent protection in China. In this way, the PRC 
Patent Law has essentially been brought in line with the GATT 
"Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of IPR." 
  "The PRC Copyright Law" and the rules for its 
implementation explicitly protect the copyright and other 
legitimate rights and interests of the authors of literary, 
artistic, and scientific works. The law also provides 
protection for computer software. China is among a select group 
of countries that have explicitly listed computer software as 
the object of protection by copyright laws. Moreover, the State 
Council has promulgated the "Regulations on the Protection of 
Computer Software," providing the specifics whereby the laws 
protecting computer software will be implemented. These 
regulations, a necessary adjunct to the Copyright Law, came into 
effect in October 1991. On 25 September 1992, the State Council 
promulgated the "Regulations on the Implementation of the 
International Copyright Treaty," providing specific regulations 
on protecting foreign authors' copyrights in accordance with the 
international treaty. 
  These laws and regulations have been joined by the "PRC 
Technological Contract Law" and the "PRC Law on Scientific and 
Technological Progress" as formulated by the NPC Standing 
Committee as well as a series of administrative regulations 
concerning intellectual property protection worked out by the 
State Council, together further optimizing the nation's legal 
system for the protection of IPR, in the whole bringing the 
system close to and in coordination with international levels of 
protection. 
  The white paper also points out that China's intellectual 
property law stipulates the legal responsibilities to be borne 
by anyone who violates the law, including civil liability, 
criminal liability, and exposure to administrative sanctions. 
  The white paper notes: With the implementation of 
intellectual property laws, IPR are effectively protected in 
China. These laws also actively encourage invention and other 
forms of creation and fair competition. For instance, the 
protection of the right to the exclusive use of registered 
trademarks has resulted in the rapid growth of the number of 
trademarks registered by Chinese and foreign businessmen in 
China. By the end of 1993, there were over 410,000 effective 
registered trademarks. Of these, 350,000 were domestic, with 
the remaining 60,000 coming from 67 countries and regions. In 
1993, there were 170,000 applications for trademark registration 
annually in China, including more than 130,000 applications for 
new trademarks registration, among the highest number in the 
world. In addition, the PRC Patent Law has greatly encouraged 
inventions and other creations in China, and has proved a magnet 
for attracting patent applications from other countries and 
regions. On 1 April 1985, the first day the Patent Law came 
into effect, 3,455 applications for patent rights were 
submitted. By the end of 1993, the PRC Patent Office had 
handled over 360,000 applications for patent rights. 
  The white paper's third part elaborates on the law 
enforcement system for intellectual property protection; that 
is, the judicial institutions and administrative channels for 
intellectual property protection. 
  In China, any citizen, legal person, or organization 
entitled 
to IPR whose rights and interests have been infringed upon may 
bring a lawsuit to the people's court in accordance with the law 
and receive practical and effective judicial protection. The 
people's courts exercise judicial power independently according 
to law; are subordinate only to the law itself; and are not 
subject to interference by any administrative organ, public 
organization, or individual. From 1986 to the end of 1993, 
people's courts throughout the country accepted and handled 
3,505 cases concerning IPR disputes, 1,168 of which concerned 
copyrights, 1,783 patents, and 554 trademark rights. In 
accordance with the law, the people's courts defend the 
legitimate rights and interests of the foreign and domestic IPR 
holders through trying cases concerning IPR disputes. 
  Intellectual property is an important civil right. In 
civil infringement cases, the people's court is empowered to 
order the infringer to bear civil responsibility for the 
cessation of the infringement, for the elimination of any 
negative effects caused by his actions, for offering apologies, 
and for compensation for any losses in accordance with the law. 
Furthermore, it is empowered to confiscate the infringer's 
illegal gains and/or adjudge the infringer to criminal detention 
or a fine. If the IPR infringement is so serious that it has 
disrupted the economic order and constitutes a crime, the 
infringer's criminal responsibility is investigated and dealt 
with according to law. Between 1992 and 1993, people's courts 
accepted 743 criminal cases for counterfeiting trademarks, of 
which 731 have been tried with 566 people being sentenced to 
fixed terms of imprisonment, criminal detention, or other 
punishments. 
  The white paper points out: In addition to judicature in 
accordance with international practices, China's system for the 
protection of IPR comprises the Patent, Trademark, and Copyright 
Laws and other administrative channels designated in 
intellectual property laws, all proceeding from China's actual 
conditions. Since the Copyright Law was put into force, local 
administrative organs responsible for copyright affairs 
investigated and dealt with more than 150 cases involving 
pirated books and video products from June 1991 to the end of 
1993. They have confiscated and destroyed the pirated goods and 
levied administrative sanctions on the infringers. In 1994, the 
Chinese Government organized the departments concerned to launch 
an assault, investigating and dealing with the illegal 
duplication of laser discs and illegal reproduction of books. 
Relevant government departments took steps to strengthen 
administration over the establishment of enterprises 
manufacturing compact discs and supervision over their 
production in accordance with the law. 
  A large proportion of the cases concerning violations of 
foreigners' intellectual property rights were investigated and 
dealt with by China's intellectual property protection 
administrative offices on their own initiative, acting in 
accordance with their prescribed functions and powers. For 
instance, since 1988, administrative organs for industry and 
commerce at various levels in Guangdong Province have 
investigated and dealt with 301 cases concerning the violation 
of U.S.-owned trademarks. Out of these 301 cases, one third 
were filed by the American trademark owners, with the remaining 
cases being the product of market investigations by industry and 
commerce administrative organs or consumer complaints. 
  In its concluding remarks, the white paper points out: More 
than a few international observers have concluded that in terms 
of intellectual property protection, China has reached 
international advanced levels. Nonetheless, China cannot remain 
satisfied with the achievements it has already made and much 
remains to be done toward optimizing China's intellectual 
property system. In its modern form, this system was 
established only a short time ago, and as a result, awareness of 
IPR remains comparatively weak in society at large. In some 
regions and governmental departments, there is insufficient 
appreciation of the importance of intellectual property 
protection. Some serious acts of infringement have violated not 
only the legitimate rights and interests of the intellectual 
property right's holder, but also the dignity of the law. 
Accordingly, the State Council has drawn up Decisions on Further 
Strengthening the Protection of Intellectual Property. The 
implementation of all the important measures contained in the 
Decisions will mark a great new step forward in the nation's 
efforts to ensure IPR protection. China will continue to 
actively promote international cooperation in the field of 
intellectual property and make positive contributions toward the 
development and optimization of the international intellectual 
property system. 
  The Intellectual Property Protection in China White Paper 
(Chinese version) will be published in booklet form by Wuzhou 
Publishing House and sold through Xinhua Bookstores across the 
country.

  [Text] A national forum on cracking down on counterfeit 
goods opened in Hangzhou today. 
  According to information revealed at the meeting, the State 
Economic and Trade Commission, the State Administration for 
Industry and Commerce, the State Bureau of Technological 
Supervision, as well as public security, supervision, and 
judicial organs are currently making arrangements for a new 
offensive against counterfeiting. Three major campaigns will be 
unfolded across the nation in June, July, and August to smash 
counterfeiting dens, investigate major cases, and rectify the 
market. The national office for cracking down on counterfeiting 
has listed 10 major cases to be intensively investigated and 
dealt with in 1994. Counterfeiting dens that need to be smashed 
as well as counterfeit and shoddy goods markets to be rectified 
and banned have been determined as well. 
  At the national forum, delegates from a dozen or so 
provinces 
and municipalities will hold discussions on the specifics in 
conducting the three major campaigns against counterfeiting.

(1957 3189 7160)] 
  [Text] Hangzhou, 15 Jun (XINHUA) -- These reporters have 
learned from the national market work conference that opened 
here today that, to meet the internal demand of establishing a 
socialist market economic system, the State Planning Commission, 
in carrying out the plan of the party's Central Committee and 
the State Council, is now in the process of drawing up the 
"Ninth Five-Year Plan" and programs for fostering and developing 
a market system for 2010. 
  As far as market establishment is concerned, the State 
Council has entrusted planning departments with such 
responsibilities as guiding and promoting the establishment of a 
national market system; and formulating plans, overall 
strategies of, and major regulatory policies for the development 
of key markets across the country. Based on investigations and 
studies, the State Planning Commission has shaped its basic 
strategies in drawing up the Ninth Five-Year Plan and programs 
for nurturing and developing a market system for 2010. Main 
features of these basic strategies, which have been submitted to 
the ongoing national market work exchange conference for 
discussion, are: 1) to take circulation as an industry to 
reverse the sluggish and backward conditions encountered in 
developing China's circulation industry; 2) to prioritize 
service to both agriculture and peasants, paying special 
attention to the reform of the circulation system for 
agricultural producer goods and the establishment of rural 
markets; 3) to better serve urban and rural residents through 
availability of more living facilities; 4) to take advantage of 
regional superiority -- particularly superiority enjoyed by the 
central and western regions -- so as to gradually narrow the gap 
between the coastal and the central and western regions through 
nurturing and developing regional markets; and 5) to stress 
linking of domestic markets -- particularly factors of 
production and high-level markets -- with international markets, 
amid protection and promotion of development of national 
industry and commerce. 
  Hao Jianxiu, vice minister in charge of the State Planning 
Commission, presented the conference with a report entitled, 
"Try Hard To Create a New Situation in Market Work To Accelerate 
Fostering and Development of a Socialist Market System." 
Centering on speeding up nurturing and developing a market 
system, the meeting will focus its discussions on such questions 
as planning strategies for a market system, establishment of a 
major commodities reserve system, and market information 
networks.

<F P=106> [By ZHEJIANG RIBAO reporter Chen Songqing (7115 7313 3237) </F>
and XINHUA reporter Shen Haixiong (1957 3189 7169)] 
  [Text] Hangzhou, 15 Jun (XINHUA) -- While inspecting the 
Hangzhou Fangxiang Group, State Councillor Chen Junsheng pointed 
out: Coastal town and township enterprises' participating in 
developing the central and western regions is not only of great 
significance to poor areas but also to national economic 
development. It is a move of strategic significance, and I hope 
that the plan will be a success. 
  Not long ago, the Hangzhou Fangxiang Group decided to invest 
funds worth 100 million yuan in merging, buying, or 
incorporating a bunch of major town and township enterprises in 
the western region. It also decided to cooperate with 
enterprises in the western region in developing new industries 
to quicken the pace of economic development in the west. 
  After hearing the report by Lu Guanqiu, general manager of 
the Hangzhou Fangxiang Group, Chen Junsheng said: "I have 
already heard of your `westward plan' in Beijing, and I am very 
glad to know about it. I made this special trip to your company 
today to express my support for your `westward plan.' I also 
wish your `westward plan' success. I hope that it will 
encourage more coastal town and township enterprises to 
participate in developing the central and western regions and in 
supporting economically underdeveloped regions." 
  Chen Junsheng pointed out: Cooperation between the east and 
the west in joint development is of strategic significance. It 
serves the purpose of supporting poverty-stricken areas as well 
as the need for coastal town and township enterprises to further 
develop themselves. At present, being affected by the labor 
force, land resources, and other various factors, coastal town 
and township enterprises are seizing the opportunity to invest 
in the western region. This move will enable coastal town and 
township enterprises to reinvigorate themselves and to help town 
and township enterprises in the central and western regions to 
improve their economic efficiency and to develop healthily. 
Combining professionals, technology, and capital from the east 
with natural resources and the labor force in the west will 
definitely enhance both the eastern and western regions' 
strength and stamina of economic development. Moreover, the 
fundamental way to accomplish the state's goal of supporting 
poverty-stricken areas and helping 80 million people in poor 
areas lead a fairly comfortable life is to strengthen the inner 
vitality of economically undeveloped regions in terms of their 
economic development. At present, the economically 
underdeveloped central and western regions have abundant surplus 
laborers. If town and township enterprises in the eastern 
region can concentrate funds, technology, and professionals to 
develop the economy in the western region, the surplus laborers 
will be able to work in their hometowns. This will help reduce 
the number of migrant workers and maintain social stability. 
  Chen Junsheng said emphatically: The relevant departments in 
both the eastern and western regions must give support to their 
town and township enterprises and vigorously encourage them to 
jointly develop natural resources in the central and western 
regions on a mutual beneficial and reciprocal basis; quicken the 
pace of helping the central and western regions shake off 
poverty and become prosperous; gradually diminish the central 
and western regions' disparity compared to the eastern region; 
and promote sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic 
development.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Industrial Growth Hits 17 Percent While </F>
Inflation Lingers"] 
  [Text] China's economy continued its double-digit growth 
last month despite lingering inflation. 
  Industrial output hit 17.3 per cent in May the State 
Statistics Bureau announced yesterday. 
  The growth in production is due to the easing of credit 
controls by the government, which in turn has led to a rise in 
capital investment, said the bureau's economists. 
  And, Xinhua News Agency quoted an official from the State 
Economic and Trade Commission as saying that the GDP is expected 
to grow by about 12 per cent in the first half of this year, 
making it easier for the country to achieve the 9-10 GDP per 
cent growth in 1994. [sentence as published] 
  The fixed assets invested by work units hit 67.6 billion 
yuan 
($7.8 billion) in May, up nearly 28 per cent from the same month 
last year, the statistics bureau reported. 
  During the first five months of this year, State units 
invested 204.4 billion yuan ($23.5 billion) in the country's 
fixed assets sector, representing a rise of 34.2 percent over 
the same period a year ago the bureau said. 
  Of this, money used for construction accounted for 114.1 
billion yuan ($13.1 billion), up 35.1 percent over the same 
period last year. 
  Inflation also continued its double-digit growth this year, 
the bureau said. 
  In May, the cost of living index in the country was 21.3 per 
cent, higher than the same time of last year. But this was 0.4 
per cent lower than the growth of 21.7 per cent reported a month 
earlier. 
  The bureau's economists said living costs have been 
persistently high in the country's big cities, partly because of 
random price hikes of food and catering services. 
  The inflation in the country's 35 large and medium cities 
saw 
a growth of 23.2 per cent in April. And in May, the prices 
continued to grow at the same level. 
  Government departments should maintain strict control over 
the prices in a bid to meet this year's inflation target of 10 
per cent nationwide and 15 percent in major cities, as 
designated by the central government, said the economists. 
  They noted that efforts to increase bank savings and issuing 
treasury bonds are helping to curb inflation. 
  Banks and credit companies saw their individual and 
institutional savings increase by 113.4 billion yuan ($13 
billion) last month. The figure was 79.4 billion yuan ($9.1 
billion) higher than the same period last year, the bureau said. 
  And by the end of May, the State had sold more than 68.1 
billion yuan ($7.8billion) worth of treasury bonds. 
  It included the sale of two-year bonds valued at 24.8 
billion 
yuan ($2.8 billion), more than meeting the planned target, the 
bureau said. 
  A growth of bank savings and the brisk sale of State 
treasury 
bonds lead to a 33.7 percent growth in State revenue in May. 
  The success of financial reforms also helped to stimulate 
industrial growth in the already buoyant domestic market. 
  In May, the country's retail sales totalled 121.4 billion 
yuan ($14 billion), up 6.1 percent over the same period of last 
year.

  [Text] Beijing, 15 Jun (XINHUA) -- According to the State 
General Administration of Taxation, as of the end of April this 
year, industrial and commercial taxes collected in Shanghai 
reached 14.803 billion yuan, up 59 percent over the same period 
last year. Of this amount, the central government collected 
9.055 billion yuan, and the local government 5.748 billion yuan 
-- the ratio between them was 61.17 percent to 38.83 percent. 
The revenue increases, progress of tax collection, and 
proportion of the central government's revenue are all larger or 
quicker than the country's average. 
  According to the State General Administration of Taxation, 
since the new tax system was introduced, Shanghai has not 
witnessed any worrisome fluctuations or big increase in prices. 
As a result, people are free from anxiety, and the market is 
brisk. This has laid a foundation for the increase of 
industrial and commercial taxes. Tax departments at various 
levels in Shanghai promptly and effectively trained tax 
collectors and managers in various ways and tested their 
knowledge of the new tax system. While compiling reference 
materials on the new tax system for enterprises, tax organs gave 
special lectures or explanations on such difficult points as 
taxes included in the calculated prices; taxes not included in 
the calculated prices; taxpayers; and those whose tax 
obligations have yet to be fulfilled. Such training and 
publicity created favorable conditions for the smooth 
implementation of the new tax system and increase of revenues. 
  In tax levying and management, Shanghai Municipality made 
conscientious efforts to have general taxpayers understand the 
need for the value-added tax and to supply special invoices. 
The municipality appropriately adjusted the way in which it 
used to levy and manage taxes. It also strengthened its 
management of tax returns and invoicing. Since the 
implementation of the new tax system, more and more enterprises 
have reported on the invoices they issued. This has effectively 
guaranteed their payment of taxes. 
  Shanghai Municipality also strengthened its examination of 
tax payment receipts and its coordination with banks in order to 
ensure that all tax payments go to the state treasury. At the 
same time, the municipality also stepped up its work of 
destroying old tax payment receipts and set strict limits on 
invoices issued by enterprises. This was aimed at ensuring the 
correct use of new tax payment receipts and the accurate 
collection of taxes. 
  Since 1 January this year, Shanghai Municipality's tax 
departments have taken measures to strengthen their control and 
screening of invoices and tax payment receipts. All the tax 
payment receipts issued in the first quarter of the year have 
been checked, and the accuracy of using and filling in such 
receipts has also improved. As of the end of April, special 
invoices issued by 64,700 general taxpayers were checked, 
accounting for the 72.2 percent of those special invoices which 
should be checked. Also checked were 5,758,100 special invoices 
involving the added-value tax, 531,000 of which were 
questionable, accounting for 9.22 percent of the checked 
invoices. 
  While implementing the new tax system, Shanghai Municipality 
has cracked down on those issuing forged invoices. The 
municipal inspection and auditing group, and district inspection 
and auditing detachments took joint action in cracking down on 
the production and selling of forged invoices in several places 
in the city. Forged invoices were put on display to enable 
people to recognize them. In coordination with public security 
and procuratorial departments, the tax office in Zhabei district 
on 11 March raided Xinkezhan and two other places where illicit 
selling of forged invoices was rampant, and discovered more than 
30 people peddling such invoices. Public security personnel 
arrested eight of them and confiscated over 1,000 forged 
invoices of various kinds.

  [Text] As China has yet to promulgate and enforce a law on 
the control of pollution caused by solid wastes, there is a 
degree of difficulty in solving the problem of imported 
hazardous wastes. However, due to repeated occurrences of 
similar incidents, relevant state departments have begun to 
attach high importance to such incidents. 
  In a telephone interview with the station's Nightly News 
editor today over the importing of chemical wastes at Nanjing 
Port and of industrial waste at Ningbo Port, Wang Yangzu, deputy 
director of the State Environmental Protection Bureau, 
reiterated that as early as 1991, the State Environmental 
Protection Bureau and the General Administration of Customs had 
issued a circular on controlling the import of hazardous wastes. 
Wang Yangzu called on relevant departments in localities to 
strictly handle matters according to the guidelines set forth in 
the circular and called on them to mete out severe punishment to 
units and individuals who import hazardous wastes without 
authorization.

<F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Air China Inks $47 Million Deal for </F>
Simulators] 
  [Text] Air China is spending millions to improve flight 
safety with devices for better pilot training on the mainland. 
  The nation's flagship carrier formally placed a $47 million 
order yesterday with Canada for three full-flight simulators 
that replicate conditions for Boeing 747s, 737s, 767s and 757s. 
  The deal was inked in Beijing between heads of the airline, 
CAE Electronics of Canada and China Aviation Supplies 
Corporation (CASC) which will handle imports. 
  "This is telling evidence of Air China's resolve not only to 
be the leader of civil aviation in China and one of the leaders 
in the world, but also keep up with the advanced levels in 
flight training," said airline president Yin Wenlong. 
  "We already have a safety record of 39 years, and we have 
the 
determination to continue that record," he stressed. 
  Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua and the Canadian Ambassador Fred 
Bild 
were present at the signing ceremony. 
  The three most sophisticated simulators, confirmed by 
Federal 
Aviation Administration of U.S. as highest grade, will be set up 
at Air China's new training centre near Beijing Capital Airport. 
  The 130,000-square-metre centre, under intense construction 
since last August, will be the most advanced pilot training base 
when it opens in July 1995. 
  This will enable Air China to train its pilots almost 
exclusively at home, said an Air China training official. 
  Because the airline operates 63 jets -- led by 14 Boeing 
747s, 8 767s and 19 737s -- it spends more than $1 million a 
year sending pilots to the U.S., Australia and other countries 
for training. 
  The imported simulators will foster pilot talent and slash 
costs, the trainer said. 
  He said Air China, though boasting almost 1,000 pilots, 
needs 
to add nearly 60 pilots a year to meet growing demand for air 
travel. 
  Other domestic carriers will be permitted to rent the 
facilities for their pilots. 
  "CAE is very proud to supply the world's best flight 
simulators to Air China, said Rusi Master, president of the 
Canadian firm. 
  "The first and immediate benefit is to the users -- the 
pilots," he continued. The second benefit would be to the 
society as a whole by making air travel safety with good 
training devices." [sentence as published] 
  The simulators can imitate all kinds of air conditions, 
including different weather, helping train the pilots to cope 
with emergencies. 
  "We sincerely hope that CAE and us will fully honour the 
contract and make concerted efforts to make the world-class 
Beijing Flight Training Centre a reality," said Yin Wenlong. 
  "That is a guarantee of our future fruitful co-operation and 
a blessing for the health of civil aviation in China," he added. 
  Under the deal, the Canadian side is charged with 
installment 
and on-the-spot service of the simulators, the first of which 
will be delivered in August 1995. 
  As the largest carrier in China, Air China runs 33 
international routes and 57 domestic trunk routes, making 
Beijing the centre of a transport web.

  [Text] Xian, June 16 (XINHUA) -- China's largest 
manufacturer of unmanned planes is working to expand its 
overseas market. 
  Officials from the Aisheng group under Northwest Engineering 
University said that in one or two years they plan to export two 
new models of unmanned planes, which can be used in monitoring, 
location and tracking of targets on the earth. 
  The group has already exported over 30 of its unmanned 
planes 
to South Asia, Africa and South America. The good performance 
of these planes have been highly appreciated by the overseas 
customers, said the officials. 
  Since 1958, the group in the capital of northwest China's 
Shaanxi Province has produced more than 6,000 unmanned planes of 
13 types, which have found a wide use in border patrols, the 
anti-drug fight, aerial surveying and disaster observation. 
  The group's latest unmanned plane was developed last year. 
The officials said its overall technical level is 
state-of-the-art internationally. 
  Weighing less than 85 kg, the plane can fly as high as 5,000 
m at 100 m per second. It has an optimum flight duration of one 
hour or 40 km and is equipped with advanced electronic 
instruments, said the officials. 
  The group has received many inquiries from overseas about 
buying unmanned planes for various uses, the officials added.

  [Text] Beijing, June 17 (XINHUA) -- It was sunset and 
hundreds of fishing boats laden with their catches returned to 
Jiaozhou Bay in east China. 
  "We have not had such a good harvest in the coastal waters 
for years," said a weather-beaten fisherman busy unloading live 
fish and other aquatic products. 
  "In the past, the sea water for a time turned blackish and 
the fish started to die," he said. The picture is now 
different. He attributed the clean water and the coming back of 
fish to the Chinese government's anti-pollution efforts. 
  According to Xu Hongkai, an official of the Qingdao city 
environmental protection bureau, 80 percent of the pollutants in 
coastal waters used to come from the land. 
  Located on Jiaozhou Bay, Qingdao city has studied and worked 
out regulations to strengthen the oceanic environment, and 
invested an annual 40 million yuan in cleaning and controlling 
pollutant sources. It also built four pollution treatment 
projects with loans from the Asian Development Bank. 
  "As a result, the contents of key pollutants in the sea 
water 
has dropped steadily over the past five years," Xu said. 
  Qingdao is one of the places benefiting from the 
government's 
efforts to protect the oceanic environment. 
  China has 32,000 kilometers of coastline and three million 
square kilometers of sea areas, equal to less than one third of 
the country's landspace. 
  As long as 15 years ago, the Chinese Government laid down 
the 
principle that the environment must be protected alongside 
economic development, and conducted a number of research surveys 
on the environment and pollution control in the Bohai Sea and 
Yellow Sea. 
  In the early 1980s, the central government formulated six 
laws to protect the marine environment. The National Bureau of 
Oceanography set up a nationwide pollutant monitoring network 
and designated 39 sea zones for the dumping of waste, employing 
a system of licensing for dumping. 
  Zhu Guangqing, an official of the State Administration of 
Environmental Protection, said: "While rearranging the 
industrial location and product mix, the government has built a 
number of waste water treatment projects at ports and offshore 
oilfields and on ships." 
  It also designated 56 nature reserves to protect the ocean, 
oceanic ecology, plants and animals. These reserves cover a 
total area of 3.7 million hectares. 
  One example is the Yancheng National Nature Reserve in 
Jiangsu Province, where the number of red-crowned cranes, a rare 
bird under top government protection, has increased from 200 in 
1984 to more than 800 at present. 
  Nowadays, wherever you go along the coastal areas, you will 
see bill-boards with slogans like "developing the oceanic 
economy while protecting the sea". 
  China has concluded agreements with 30 countries for jointly 
protecting oceanic resources and environment. 
  While joining in three international pacts to ban ships 
leaking oil and polluting the sea, China has joined the efforts 
to protect the environment of the north-west Pacific Ocean zone 
and wishes to participate in the plan to protect the oceanic 
environment of the east Asian sea areas. 
  Yan Hongmo, director of the National Bureau of Oceanography, 
acknowledged that there is still room for improvement in the 
formation of laws and expansion of the number of specialists in 
oceanic environmental protection. Further efforts are to be 
made in this field. 
  He noted that China has just worked out a plan to clean and 
control pollutants in the sea by the year 2000.

  [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- China is urging its 
hundreds of millions of farmers to put fertilizer underground -- 
to reduce pollution and farm expenditure and improve yields. 
  By so doing, China could save at least 9.5 million tons of 
carbamide each year, and reduce environmental pollution caused 
by inefficient use of chemical fertilizers. 
  China imported about 18 million tons of chemical fertilizers 
in 1993. 
  Song Shuyou, an official of the Ministry of Agriculture, 
told 
a national agricultural meeting today that the new method of 
applying fertilizers can enable farmers to cut their expenditure 
for fertilizers and raise yields and income by about 600 yuan 
per hectare. 
  The official told agricultural officials from nine provinces 
and municipalities that the traditional way of applying chemical 
fertilizers is wasteful and causes large-scale pollution. 
  Traditionally, fertilizers were unevenly spread manually 
over 
the surface of the soil. Only some 30 percent is actually 
absorbed by plants, while most of the useful elements were lost 
by evaporation after exposure to sunlight or washed away by 
water or rain, thus polluting the air, rivers and lakes, said 
Song. 
  "If the efficiency is raised by 10 percentage points to 40 
percent, it would mean an equivalent of 9.5 million tons of 
carbamide will be saved," said the official at the meeting in 
Hebei Province's Guan County, about three hours' drive from 
Beijing. 
  In some developed countries, sixty percent of the chemical 
fertilizers were absorbed by plants, Song said. 
  According to the method listed on the ministry's nationwide 
technique extension program, farmers are advised to put chemical 
fertilizers six to 10 cm under the soil by hand or machine. 
  The official said the new method helps the plants to absorb 
more nutrients from the fertilizers and reduce pollution. 
  According to the results of the experiments in the provinces 
of Shandong, Henan, Liaoning and Heilongjiang by the Chinese 
Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the new method increased the 
per unit yield of cotton, wheat, corn and soybean by six percent 
to 15.2 percent in comparison with the traditional one. 
  The ministry plans to introduce the new technique to 66 
million ha [hectares] of cultivated land over a five-year 
period, starting this year.

  [Text] Nanchang, June 16 (XINHUA) -- After the disaster 
brought by torrential rains in early May, the northern to 
southern areas of Jiangxi Province have again received, 
incessantly heavy to torrential rains since 8 June and water 
levels in dams across big and small rivers have risen suddenly, 
causing heavy losses to industrial and agricultural production, 
the state, and the people's lives and property. 
  The average rainfall registered in the entire province 8-14 
June was 197 mm; 80 counties (cities) registered rainfalls of 
over 100 mm, with rainfalls in 38 of these counties (cities) 
exceeding 200 mm and rainfalls in six others exceeding 300 mm. 
The rains persisted over a long time and were heavy this time, 
causing rapid increases in water levels in dams across big and 
small rivers. Water levels along the Chang Jiang [2490 3068], 
the Lean He, the Xiu He, the Xin Jiang, and some tributaries of 
the Gan Jiang successively rose above the warning lines, and 11 
large reservoirs in the province successively opened their 
sluice gates to release flood water. 
  Sustained torrential rains have caused serious flood 
disasters. Incomplete statistics at present reveal that 
provincewide, 46 counties (cities) were hit by flood disasters, 
with over 3.5 million people affected by the disasters, 83,000 
houses damaged, 7,180 houses collapsed, 19 people dead, and over 
400,000 hectares of farm crops destroyed. Because of the 
disasters, 280 industrial and mining enterprises in the province 
totally stopped production and 296 others partially stopped 
production. 
  The Jiangxi provincial party committee and government 
attached utmost importance to flood prevention and fighting, are 
closely monitoring the flood situation, and are organizing and 
giving instructions on flood relief work. All principal party 
and government leaders of prefectures and counties should go 
right to the front line and lead the masses in flood fighting 
and relief work. 
  At present, torrential rains still persist in parts of 
Jiangxi, and the disaster is expanding.

  [Text] Lhasa, June 17 (XINHUA) -- Tibet is stepping up 
economic development in line with the various characteristics 
across this remote Chinese autonomous region, to rationalize its 
economic set-up. 
  According to a plan mapped out by the regional government, 
Tibet has classified itself into the central, north, east and 
west parts, according to the areas' economic structure. 
  The 18 counties in the central part of the region have been 
designated as the bread-basket of the autonomous region. A 
comprehensive agricultural development program is now being 
initiated in the areas, with two billion yuan from the central 
government. 
  The project has already produced an extra 10 million kg of 
grain, over one million kg of vegetables and another 1.6 million 
kg of meat. 
  A group of manufacturing and processing enterprises has shot 
up in the area, as energy and communications facilities have 
been greatly improved, making it a major production center of 
commodity grain, vegetables and foodstuffs, textiles and light 
industry. 
  The northern part of Tibet has been listed as a center for 
animal husbandry. About 60 million yuan has been invested in 
Nagqu alone to build livestock-raising facilities and provide 
local herdsmen with shelters to settle down. The move has added 
an average 250 yuan per capita per year for the local herdsmen. 
  The development of forestry products will be emphasized in 
Nyingchi and Qamdo. In the region's west and south, focus will 
be on an export-oriented economy, as the area shares 3,800 km of 
borders with neighboring countries.

<F P=106> ["Communique on the Tibet Autonomous Region's Environmental </F>
Situation in 1993" -- by the Tibet Autonomous Regional Bureau of 
Urban and Rural Construction and Environmental Protection, June 
1994] 
  [Text] According to Article 11 of the "Environmental 
Protection Law of the PRC," the Tibet Autonomous Region's 
environmental situation in 1993 is announced as follows: 
I. Environmental Conditions 
(1) The Environmental Pollution Situation 
  1. The Atmosphere 
  A total of 1.47 billion standard cubic meters of waste gases 
were discharged in Tibet in 1993, 40 percent more than the 
previous year. In the discharged waste gases, smog was 98 
tonnes, 63.3 percent more than the year before; sulfur dioxide 
was 1,900 tonnes, up 35.7 percent from the year before; and 
industrial dust was 14,657.7 tonnes, an increase of 8.6 percent 
over the previous year. 
  The daily average measurement over 1993 of suspended 
particles in the atmosphere in Lhasa was 194 micrograms per 
cubic meter; the daily average measurement of sulfur dioxide was 
615 micrograms per cubic meter; the daily average of nitrogen 
oxide was 11 micrograms per cubic meter, which was better than 
the previous year and was up to the state's first-level standard 
of atmospheric quality. No acid rains occurred in Tibet in 1993. 
  2. Water 
  A total of 40.775 million tonnes of waste water was 
discharged in Tibet in 1993, up 133 percent from the previous 
year. Of this, industrial waste water was 25.775 million 
tonnes, up 1,332 percent from the year before. Among the 
industrial waste water, chemical (?oxygen absorbent) [xu yang 
liang, 7194 8638 6852] was 25.173 tonnes, heavy metals (mercury 
and lead) were 0.17 tonnes, arsenic was 45.6 tonnes, and 
sulphide was 16.32 tonnes. (Note: The reason why industrial 
waste water increased sharply was that the waste water 
discharged by the Yangbajing experimental geothermal power plant 
was included in this figure; over the last few years, only a 
part of the plant's waste water was taken into account due to 
technical reasons.) 
  The quality of water in Tibet's major rivers and lakes 
reached the state's standards for surface water quality. 
  3. Noise in Urban Areas 
  In 1993, the average equivalent sound level of environmental 
noises in Lhasa city's residential, cultural and educational, 
commercial, and industrial areas as well as mixed area category 
two was all above 60 decibels, exceeding the state environmental 
noise standard for urban areas. Noise levels at eight -- or 
30.8 percent -- of the 26 monitoring points on the city's trunk 
roads exceeded the standard. Compared to the previous year, the 
sources of urban noise and their proportions remained unchanged, 
with traffic noises still topping the list. (Note: mixed area 
category two refers to areas consisting of industrial, 
commercial, and residential sectors with small traffic volume) 
  4. Industrial Solid Wastes and Others 
  In 1993, Tibet's industrial solid wastes amounted to 2,950 
tonnes, up 17 percent over that of the previous year; and the 
amount discharged was 260 tonnes, up 30 percent. The discharge 
occupied 0.2 hectares of land, but no farmland was used. 
  According to relevant investigation, occupational diseases 
such as pneumoconiosis and toxicosis diagnosed in workers of the 
region's industrial and mining enterprises were both lower than 
the national level. In 1993, there was no accident that caused 
environmental pollution in the region. 
(2) The Ecological Environment Situation 
  1. Forests and Grasslands 
  According to the outcome of the fourth national inspection 
on 
forest resources, Tibet was covered with 7.17 million hectares 
of forests, fourth among the nation's provinces, municipalities, 
and autonomous regions. The rate of forest coverage was 9.84 
percent, and the region's 2.084 billion cubic meters of timber 
reserves topped the nation. In 1993, the volume of 200,000 
cubic meters of cut timber was lower than that of the region's 
total forest growth. 
  Tibet's grasslands continued to degenerate with decreasing 
grass growth and coverage area. There were serious problems of 
grass diseases and weed growth, as well as rat and insect pests 
in grassland regions. 
  In 1993, the area of public green grounds in urban areas 
remained relatively unchanged compared to the previous year. 
The per capita area of public green grounds dropped by 4 square 
meters. 
  2. Land 
  The farmland area in Tibet was 223,800 hectares, and the per 
capita farmland area was 1.51 mu. In 1993, 28.24 hectares of 
farmland were permanently requisitioned for construction. 
  3. Climatic Changes and Natural Disasters 
  In 1993, Tibet's climate was basically perennial. The annual 
rainfall was lower than that for the previous years and its 
distribution was uneven. The number of days of gales was 
basically normal, with frequency higher in Lhaze, Baingoin, 
Ngari, and the northern part of Qamdo, but lower in other areas. 
  Droughts were severe during early summer in 1993. Uneven 
rainfall distribution and continuous rainstorms resulted in 
floods. Heavy rains triggered landslides and disrupted traffic, 
causing heavy losses. Snowstorms in winter caused the deaths of 
livestock. 
  In 1993, the rate of forest fires was 2.6 percent. 
II. Environmental Protection 
  In 1993, China marked the 20th anniversary of commencement 
of 
environmental protection as well as the 10th anniversary of 
incorporation of environmental protection into its basic 
national policy. The Tibet regional party committee and 
people's government attached further importance to and 
strengthened the tasks for environmental protection by adopting 
the "Decision on Strengthening Environmental Protection." 
People's congresses and people's political consultative 
conferences at all levels strengthened their guidance and 
supervision in the work. Further, governments and departments 
at all levels earnestly implemented their duties in 
environmental protection with new progress. 
  1. Prevention of Environmental Pollution 
  In 1993, Tibet further upgraded the tasks of preventing 
environmental pollution. The rate of removed smoke and dust in 
burnt gaseous wastes was 85 percent, up five percent from the 
previous year. The rate of treated industrial sewage was 44.8 
percent, up 25.9 percent over the previous year. Comprehensive 
use of industrial solid wastes totalled 1,500 tonnes. 
  Public facilities in urban areas were further improved. 
Lhasa city built 4.46 km of new underground sewers, increasing 
the total length of the city's underground sewers to 80 km. 
  Tibet directly invested 20.82 million yuan to prevent 
industrial pollution, an increase of 13.82 million yuan over 
that of the previous year. Of this, 12 million yuan was 
invested in three environmental protection construction projects 
and 8.57 million yuan was invested in industrial sewage 
treatment. 
  2. Protection of Ecological Environment 
  In 1993, Tibet's afforestation covered a total area of 2,680 
hectares [ha], up 5.14 percent from the previous year. The 
Tibetan people voluntarily planted 4.29 million trees, or 
741,000 trees more than the previous year; and the region 
cultivated 638,000 economic trees, an increase of 546,500. 
Grass was planted on 8,000 ha of land and fencing was erected 
for some 324,668 ha of grasslands. Elimination of rats, insect 
pests, and grass diseases was carried out on 15.91 ha [as 
published], and 27,900 ha of grasslands were irrigated. 
  According to incomplete statistics, in 1993, Tibet completed 
10 water conservancy projects; improved the irrigation for 3,527 
ha of farmland; added 960 ha of irrigated farmland; and carried 
out preservation work for an additional 1,073 ha of irrigated 
farmland. The completion of seven drinking water projects helped 
to solve the water supply problem for 1,890 people and 7,890 
livestock. 
  In 1993, Tibet put into operations seven hydroelectric power 
stations with a generating capacity of 9,220 kilowatts, and 
added small hydroelectric power generators with a capacity of 
3,225 kilowatts in rural areas. An additional 32 villages and 
4,868 people were provided with power supply. The "Tibet 
Yangguang [sun] Plan" entered its second phase. Last year, the 
region promoted the use of 3,500 units of solar stoves, 180 
square meters of solar water heaters, and small solar power 
sources with a capacity of 4.8 kilowatts. Energy conserved from 
the use of solar stoves and water heaters was equivalent to some 
3,000 tonnes of standard coal. The development of hydroelectric 
power and the promotion of solar energy use enhanced ecological 
environmental protection in the region. 
  The comprehensive development work in the middle reaches of 
the Yarlung Zangbo River, Lhasa River, and Nyang Qu River 
proceeded well. As of 1993, 18 forestry projects, 25 water 
conservancy projects, and 4 energy projects -- with a total 
investment of nearly 175 million yuan -- had been launched in 
the region. By building water conservancy projects, revamping 
medium and low yield farmlands, improving grasslands, and 
planting trees, the comprehensive development in the region has 
yielded noticeable economic results, social benefits, and 
environmental results. 
  We made relatively good progress in building nature 
conservation areas in 1993. The Mount Qomolangma [Everest] 
Nature Conservation Area was listed as a state-level nature 
conservation area. In addition, the regional government 
approved and established six regional-level nature conservation 
areas, adding 289,900 square km to Tibet's nature conservation 
areas. At the end of 1993, Tibet had 13 state and regional 
level nature conservation areas, with a total area of 325,400 
square km, accounting for 26.5 percent of Tibet's total area. 
  3. Strengthening Environmental Management 
  A nationwide inspection of enforcement of the environmental 
protection law was conducted in 1993. The Tibet Regional 
People's Congress Standing Committee and Government attached 
great importance to the inspection -- we set up a regional 
leading group to coordinate inspection work, worked out an 
inspection plan, and laid down a plan for carrying out 
inspection work. Environmental and resources management 
departments and law enforcement departments at all levels did 
their jobs strictly according to the law, and good results were 
achieved. Over the last few years, assessment of environmental 
effects has been conducted for all construction projects that 
might affect the environment. Construction of pollution 
prevention facilities has been carried out on 80 percent of 
regional level construction projects. The amounts of pollution 
discharge fees levied by the government in 1993 increased 
considerably over the previous year, and the fees were levied on 
more projects than before. In 1993, forestry public security 
departments uncovered 56 cases involving damaging resources and 
the environment; cracked four rings engaged in these activities; 
punished 111 persons; confiscated 650 guns, 98 wildlife 
products, 35,000 steel loops, 447 iron clips, and 22,600 yuan in 
stolen money and goods. 
  All localities in Tibet continued to conduct environmental 
protection propaganda activities in 1993 -- they featured 
television serial reports on environmental protection and held 
region-wide quizzes on environmental protection. Leaders of 
Tibet delivered speeches on television on "World Environment 
Day." 
  Tibet had 79 environmental protection workers at the end of 
1993. An environment monitoring station was built in Xigaze 
Prefecture and is ready for operation. Shannan Prefecture and 
Lhasa have approved establishment of environment monitoring 
stations. 
  In 1993, the "Study of the Background of Tibet's Soil and 
Environment" project won the region's second-grade prize for 
scientific work. 
  The Tibet Autonomous Regional environment monitoring station 
was named an advanced environmental protection collective of the 
country. 
  Environmental protection benefits the contemporary 
generation 
and the generations to come. Currently, Tibet is still one of 
the country's economically backward areas; therefore, economic 
development and environmental protection are equally arduous 
tasks for the region. We need to continue to work hard to 
maintain and gradually improve Tibet's environmental conditions 
and to ensure that the region's economy develops in a sustained, 
rapid, and healthy manner.

  [Text] Lhasa, June 15 (XINHUA) -- The Tibet Meteorological 
Bureau stresses cultivation of Tibetan professionals for the 
weather forecast sector. 
  Since 1981, the bureau has selected 520 Tibetans from the 
region and sent them to study in specialized schools and 
universities in inland provinces. 
  Now the proportion of Tibetan weather men to the total has 
increased from 18.6 percent to 70.3 percent. 
  Of all technological personnel in the Tibet meteorological 
sector, the Tibetan technicians account for more than 50 percent. 
  Purpu Cering is the first Tibetan to graduate from Nanjing 
Meteorology Institute, China's most prestigious in the field, 
with a master's degree. Last year, he went to the United States 
to participate in a modern meteorology program with the 
recommendation of the National Meteorological Bureau. 
  The 25-year-old engineer completed several research projects 
and returned with high praise from Chinese and foreign experts. 
  This year, the Tibet Meteorological Bureau selected six 
young 
Tibetans to enter Nanjing Meteorology Institute's master's 
program.

  [Text] Lhasa, June 16 (XINHUA) -- The news media and 
publications have developed quickly in the Tibet Autonomous 
Region in recent years. 
  Now there are 15 kinds of newspapers compared with four in 
1987. There are also 37 periodicals and 73 professional journals 
of various kinds and two audio-video presses. 
  "There was no modern press industry in Tibet before 
liberation," said Lopsong Phuntsog, director of the Press and 
Publication Bureau of Tibet. Even in 1987, there were only six 
periodicals and one publishing house in the whole region. 
  According to Lopsong, the regional government has used state 
subsidies mainly for publications in Tibet. 
  All the presses have done well to provide sufficient 
textbooks for primary and middle schools. The Tibet education 
press is to be established within this year to better support 
Tibet's education. 
  Buddhist scriptures used to be printed only in the 
monasteries and only in wood engravings. Now, 26 printers of 
various kinds have been set up in the region and all the big 
monasteries have their own printing houses. Laser photographic 
techniques used in printing have been popularized in Tibet and 
offset printing is gradually replacing letterpress printing. 
  The state has made a series of preferential policies in 
support of the development of the Tibetan press. 
  The XINHUA bookstores in Tibet enjoy a tax-free status. The 
state gives Tibet's publications industry a subsidy of four 
million yuan annually.

<F P=106> [Article by Shi Zilong (0670 1311 7893) entitled "Society's </F>
Causes and Countermeasures for Abducting and Trafficking in 
Women"] 
  [Text] Our region is one of the whole country's main 
provinces with the inflow of abducted women. Although the 
governments at various levels and the departments concerned have 
transferred and organized a large number of personnel to deal 
special blows to the women abductors and traders on several 
occasions, to investigate and arrest human traders, and to 
rescue the abducted women, the number of abducted women is still 
on a rise. 
  Through investigations in Qingshuihe County of Ulanqab 
League, we discovered that there are deep social backgrounds for 
the emergence and development of the criminal activities of 
abducting and trafficking in women. 
  1. Abducting and trafficking in women is a strange embryo 
produced by the gigantic transformation of society. Since the 
implementation of the production responsibility system in rural 
areas, movement in population flow has become more lively. 
Particularly, most of the areas with the outflow of population 
are mountain areas where economic development is rather 
backward, the living environment is very bad, people live a hard 
life, and there is a relative surplus in the population. While 
these women lack the know-how to enter society, they have the 
desire and courage to do so, and have become the main baggage of 
human traders. For instance, women from Sichuan comprise the 
majority of the women abducted and marketed in Qingshuihe 
County, and women from Mianyang area account for two-thirds of 
the total from Sichuan. Most of these women were abducted and 
sold to Qingshuihe County by swallowing the bait of job, 
business, and trip offers. 
  2. Men in areas where there is an influx of abducted women 
have strong desires for marriage. This has weakened society's 
attention to the women abduction and marketing activities. Most 
areas with the inflow of abducted women are economically 
backward areas, with a sparse population, and a wide discrepancy 
in the ratio of men and women. For instance, the ratio of men 
and women in Qingshuihe County is 115 to 100, with 8,716 more 
men than women. Some male adults in this county only rely on 
females from other places to resolve their marriage problems. 
So, the people maintain that an abducted woman can help offset 
the number of bachelors. This kind of normal marriage desire 
weakens the people's understanding about and attention to the 
criminal activities of abducting and trafficking in women. 
Under such circumstances, it is difficult to form a social 
foundation under which all the people deal blows to women 
abductors and traders. 
  3. The extremely complicated situation enhances the 
difficulties in dealing blows to human abductors and traders. 
By the end of 1992, 1,880 women from other parts of the country 
flowed into Qingshuihe County. Of them, 1,107 women were 
volunteers, 756 were abducted and trafficked in, and 17 ganged 
up with the swindlers to engage in women abduction and trading 
activities. Besides, there are a countless number of women who 
have escaped after being abducted and trafficked in. It is thus 
clear that of the incoming population from another places, there 
are both lawful marriage partners and women that have been 
abducted and trafficked in. Simultaneously, there are swindling 
activities. Such circumstances have objectively brought 
difficulties to the law enforcement departments in fixing the 
nature of the cases. Particularly, it is more difficult to 
punish the human traders who have escaped with unlawful gains 
before the women abduction and trading cases are exposed. 
  4. Buying and marketing marriage partners becomes the 
hotbed of abduction and trading of women. The buying and 
marketing of marriage partners is extremely popular in areas 
where there is an influx of abducted women. Money becomes the 
basic condition for marriage. A man in the rural areas of 
Qingshuihe County needs to spend over 10,000 yuan in cash gifts 
to marry a woman. Therefore, it is very attractive in some 
poverty-stricken areas to buy an abducted woman with four to 
five thousand yuan. Some people are even willing to run the 
risk of losing both women and money, of being punished by laws, 
to buy abducted women. High incomes also encourage human 
traders to defy laws and ceaselessly engage themselves in 
criminal activities. 
  Therefore, we maintain that dealing blows to the criminal 
activities of abducting and trading in women requires systematic 
engineering. We should mobilize all social forces to deal blows 
to these activities. 
  1. We should be determined to resolutely uproot the soil of 
abducting and trading in women and buying and marketing marriage 
partners. The party committees and governments at various 
levels should put the elimination of the remnants of feudalism, 
such as in the buying and marketing marriage partners, onto 
their work agenda, regard it as an important content of the 
spiritual civilization of rural areas, and conscientiously 
attend to the basic work relating to attacking women abductors 
and traders. Simultaneously, we should upgrade the quality of 
the young people in rural areas in line with the rural areas' 
education on culture, sciences, technologies, and laws. We 
should not only have the people in rural areas understand that 
purchasing abducted women is a criminal activity, but also make 
them respect the personal rights and interests of the women and 
to seek a lofty, civilized family life. 
  2. We should further draw a clear line of demarcation 
between 
guilt and nonguilt to enhance the effectiveness of the attack 
against criminals. Specifically speaking, we should draw a 
clear line of demarcation between normal marriage with 
nonnatives and crimes of human abduction and trade, between 
marriages of normal matchmaking and crimes of human abduction 
and trade, between abduction and trading and swindling in 
partnership, and between women who are willing to stay and those 
who are being forced to stay and dare not ask for rescue. In 
line with the trend of an increasing number of nonnative women 
in areas where there is an influx in population, we should adopt 
the principle of coordinating persuasion with punishment to deal 
blows to the criminal activities of abducting and trading in 
women. The matchmakers who act as go-betweens in introducing 
marriage partners, either on a voluntary basis or through 
complete formalities, are allowed to ask for appropriate amounts 
of service charges. However, those who abduct and trade in 
women, gang up with one another to engage in swindling 
activities, and force women to engage in criminal activities, 
must not be tolerated but should resolutely be attacked. 
  3. We should develop the economy and strengthen the setup of 
democracy and legal system. This is the final way for solving 
the problems of abducting and trading in women.

  [Text] Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party 
committee, went to the municipal kinescope plant on 5 June to 
conduct investigation and study on the enterprise's effort to 
deepen reform, end deficit and increase profit, and improve 
efficiency and the life of its staff members and workers. He 
emphasized: Reform is the only way out. We must take reform as 
a driving force; add impetus to enterprise reform, to the work 
to end deficit and increase profit, and to the effort to do 
practical work for enterprises; mobilize and rely on the vast 
number of staff members and workers to participate in and carry 
out reform successfully; improve enterprises' economic 
efficiency; and facilitate faster and better economic 
development in Tianjin. 
  In the morning, Gao Dezhan, secretary; and Zheng Zhiying, 
standing committee member and secretary general of the municipal 
party committee, arrived at the kinescope plant, a state 
second-level enterprise established 20 years ago. Gao Dezhan 
and others inspected production lines at workshops and talked 
cordially with workers at their posts to learn about the 
situation. They also held a discussion with members of the 
plant's leading body to hear reports on relevant conditions. 
  The Tianjin Municipal Kinescope Plant is a large state-owned 
enterprise, which used to be a large tax payer and whose 
products have been named as quality products of the state and 
the ministry on many occasions. Due to the failure in timely 
transformation of its internal mechanisms and other reasons, the 
plant began to experience a decline in economic efficiency and 
suffer losses ever since 1990 and became a large loss maker of 
Tianjin. Since June last year when the newly adjusted leading 
body assumed office, it extensively mobilized staff members and 
workers of the entire plant to offer suggestions to rationalize 
production and adopted a series of reform measures to pull the 
enterprise out of the predicament, thus enabling it to reduce 
its losses by 50 percent in the same year. In the first five 
months of this year, an increase of over 30 percent was 
registered in the output, output value, sales income of its 
products when compared with the same period last year. The 
plant ended deficit and made a profit of over 1 million yuan in 
May. By deepening reform, it has regained vigor. 
  Gao Dezhan affirmed the plant's achievements in deepening 
reform, ending deficit, and increasing profit. He said: The 
kinescope plant achieved marked results in ending deficit and 
increasing profit thanks to deepened reform. This proved that 
reform is the only way out and the driving force. The key to 
deepening reform lies in determination, boldness, and earnest 
effort in performing work. Large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises have made great contributions to the state, and 
their quality if good. There are many factors for their current 
difficulties. As has been proven in practice, enterprises can 
be invigorated and can stimulate the enthusiasm of its staff 
members and workers as long as they pay close attention to 
enterprise reform, their own mechanisms, and the market; 
decentralize the accounting procedures; establish the market 
mechanism within their plants; and successfully conduct the 
reform of the three systems. The very reason for the kinescope 
plant to achieve substantial results within a short time is its 
effort to add impetus to reform and to the work of ending 
deficit and increasing profit. 
  Gao Dezhan said: To succeed in the internal reform of 
enterprises, a good leading body is needed, which is diligent 
and honest in performing duties and brave in pioneering new 
causes, and which wholeheartedly rely on the working class and 
give full play to its role as the major force. 
  Gao Dezhan said: As an old industrial base, Tianjin will 
have no hope if it fails to improve enterprises. Only when 
enterprises are improved and invigorated can Tianjin become 
prosperous. In doing practical work to benefit the masses, we 
should not only address current problems, but we should also 
keep the fundamental interest of the masses in mind, which, in 
the final analysis, means to promote the economy. To be 
specific, we should enhance Tianjin's economic strength, improve 
the efficiency of enterprises, increase the revenues of the 
municipality as well as districts and counties, increase the 
income of urban and rural staff members and workers, and 
continuously upgrade the living standard. As far as enterprises 
are concerned, they should achieve success in deepening reform, 
opening wider to the outside world, adjusting the structure, 
conducting technical transformation, strengthening management, 
developing new products, improving leading bodies, training 
staff members and workers, improving work teams, and building 
the spiritual civilization, which should all be focused on 
reform. Enterprises must make arduous efforts to improve their 
skills, and other units must provide favorable conditions to 
improve service. Through the concerted efforts of all fields, we 
should make good enterprises more prosperous and help difficult 
enterprises seize the opportunity quickly to resolve the 
difficulties of their staff members and workers, increase their 
income, and stimulate their enthusiasm. 
  Gao Dezhan emphasized: It is no easy task for enterprises to 
achieve good results in reform and in ending deficit and 
increasing profit. Such good results must be consolidated and 
developed. Pertinent municipal departments should earnestly 
summarize and disseminate the good typical examples in deepening 
enterprise reform, ending deficit, and increasing profit so that 
greater breakthrough can be made throughout the municipality.

  [Text] Shenyang, June 17 (XINHUA) -- About half the 
state-owned enterprises in northeast China's Liaoning Province, 
which is heavily industrialized, have begun to make profits 
after reforms and technical renovations were carried out. 
  Sources from the Liaoning Provincial Planning Committee said 
that 500 out of the 600 enterprises that have adopted new 
management systems have improved their economic efficiency. 
  Last year, profits achieved by state-owned large and 
medium-sized enterprises topped 7.32 billion yuan, 70.6 percent 
of all the industrial profits achieved in the province. 
  A leading industrial center in China, the province now has 
1,263 large and medium-sized enterprises, accounting for about 
one-tenth of China's total. 
  Most of those enterprises were built during the 1950s and 
1960s under a highly planned economy, and had served as a 
leading factor in national economic growth in the past decades. 
  But many problems in the management systems, plus in many 
cases their backward conception of the market, had led to lower 
economic efficiency, economic experts noted. 
  In the transition of the planned economy to a market 
economy, 
many poorly-run enterprises were plunged into the red, and 
outdated equipment rubbed still more salt into the wounds of the 
state-owned enterprises. 
  Zhao Xinliang, director of the Provincial Planning 
Commission, said that during the past few years, several new 
management mechanisms were introduced into state-owned 
enterprises. Reforms in labor, wage and personnel systems were 
also carried out. 
  The provincial government has offered financial help to 
them. 
More money has been spent on the technical renovation of these 
enterprises. More than 33 billion yuan was invested in the 
renovation of 1,800 projects during the past three years. 
  As a result, the renovated projects created an additional 
output value of 10 billion yuan last year, compared with the 
pre-renovation period. 
  Tax and profits totalled three billion yuan and export 
volume 
reached 180 million U.S. dollars. 
  Zhao said many state-owned enterprises have adjusted 
themselves so well that they have even started to March toward 
the international market. They include a large zinc mill in 
Huludao Island, a tractor plant in Anshan city and an automobile 
factory in Dandong city. 
  "We hope the province will again become one of the most 
developed areas in China in 10 to 15 years," said Wen Shizhen, 
acting governor of the province.

  [Text] Lanzhou, June 17 (XINHUA) -- People of northwest 
China's Gansu Province who have suffered a lot from water loss 
and soil erosion are now benefiting from a government water and 
soil control project. 
  In the southern part of Gansu Province, which covers an area 
of 3,345 square kilometers, the poverty-stricken areas have 
dropped from 66 percent to 18 percent as a result of a five-year 
effort in water and soil control drive. 
  For a long time in the past, the southern part of Gansu, 
including the Qingba Mountain areas and the upper reaches of the 
Chang Jiang River, was one of the four main areas in China 
suffering from mud-rock flow. It now has over 800 crevasses 
caused by mud- rock flows and over 200 remains of landslides. 
  In 1988, the Chinese State Council designated seven counties 
in southern Gansu as key project areas for water and soil 
control. Since then, more than 10 million yuan (about 1.2 
million U.S. Dollars) has been invested in the project each year. 
  As part of the project, land has been terraced, trees 
planted 
and grass sown in a 3,345 square kilometer area. Local people 
describe the project as "life engineering". 
  The project has brought 57 percent of water loss and soil 
erosion under control. 
  The forest coverage in the area has increased by 4 percent. 
  With the improving of farming conditions, the grain output 
in 
the area has increased. Last year, the total grain output was 
716 million kilograms, a record for the area. 
  Production centers for apples, oranges and Chinese prickly 
ash have emerged along rivers and in mountain areas in the south 
of Gansu Province.

  [Text] Our province has created a new situation in the 
work of importing and using foreign capital. By the end of last 
year, more than 1,000 internal economic cooperation contracts 
had been signed involving more than 300 million yuan, and the 
total amount of direct materials and goods coordination was more 
than 400 million yuan. Eight autonomous prefectures, 
prefectures, and cities throughout the province have established 
or developed cooperative relations with 61 areas outside the 
province based on similar trades and services. 
  Vice Governor Liu Guanghe recently led a Qinghai delegation 
to visit the United States and Canada to invite investments. It 
succeeded in signing a total 12 projects. By the end of May, 
the contracts and regulations of 82 foreign-funded enterprises 
had been examined and approved and they had received their 
approval licenses. In addition, more than $35 million in foreign 
capital had been imported. Of these foreign-funded enterprises, 
70 percent are engaged in the exploitation of natural resources 
and in production involving light industry, textiles, 
electronics, chemistry, building construction, communications, 
metallurgy, nonferrous metal, foodstuffs, agricultural and 
sideline products, and so on.

  [Text] Beijing, June 17 (XINHUA) -- A leader of the 
Communist Party of China (CPC) today called for common efforts 
from both sides of the Taiwan Straits toward the goal of China's 
reunification. 
  Li Ruihuan, a Standing Committee member of the Political 
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, reiterated that Taiwan is 
an inseparable part of China's territory and China's 
reunification is the "common wish and noble mission" of all 
Chinese people, including Taiwan compatriots. 
  Li, also chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference, made these remarks 
during a meeting with Ping-ti Ho, vice-president of the National 
Association of Chinese-Americans (of the United States). 
  Li expressed the hope that people from all walks of life on

promoting Sino-U.S. relations and the exchanges across the 
Taiwan Straits.

  [Text] Beijing, June 17 (XINHUA) -- Wang Daohan, chairman 
of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait 
[ARATS], today sent a letter to Gu Zhenfu [Ku Chen-fu], 
president of the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF], to invite 
him once again to hold a high-level meeting between the two 
organizations at a selected place. 
  The letter reads: One year ago, the Wang-Gu talks made an 
historically significant step in the development of cross-strait 
relations. I am pleased to see that various contacts and 
exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have been 
conducted vigorously since then. Some progress has been made in 
implementing the agreement during the five negotiations between 
the colleagues of ARATS and the SEF. Particularly during the 
meeting between Mr. Tang Shubei and Jiao Renhe [Chaio Jen-he] 
early this year, a high degree of consensus was reached in terms 
of routine discussions between ARATS and the SEF. The meeting 
made a plan for this year's ARATS-SEF negotiations and other 
issues relating to the negotiations and achieved another interim 
result in promoting ARATS-SEF relations and cooperation since 
the Wang-Gu talks. It is my belief that various results which 
have been achieved since the Wang-Gu talks should be highly 
valued. 
  The letter continues: Since the unfortunate "Qiandao Lake 
Incident" occurred, the development of cross-strait relations 
have been adversely affected. I am very impressed by your 
active and reasonable attitude towards maintaining the overall 
development of cross-strait relations. Amid heavy mists and 
obstacles, the two organizations should work even harder to push 
forward ARATS-SEF negotiations and exchanges. Maintaining and 
promoting the development of cross-strait relations with a 
100-times greater enthusiasm has a bearing on consolidating and 
developing the original intention and achievements of the 
Wang-Gu talks. There is no reason for relaxation. It is highly 
necessary to hold a high-level meeting for communications and 
contacts. 
  The letter says: I sent you a letter early this year, 
inviting you to visit Beijing during the turn of spring and 
summer. I learned that you would be very glad to come to the 
Mainland to meet me. Recently, you wrote an article expressing 
the hopes to further strengthen high-ranking contacts between 
the two organizations. I deem it highly necessary to hold such 
a meeting. Strengthening high-ranking contacts between the two 
organizations is beneficial to further improving understanding, 
eliminating misunderstanding, overcoming discrepancies, and 
promoting cooperation in a bid to create an atmosphere of 
frequent exchanges and relaxation for the meeting. I would like 
to renew my suggestion to hold a meeting for reviewing ARATS-SEF 
cooperation, discussing ways to strengthen our ties and expand 
our cooperation, and conducting communications on policy-related 
issues and other issues. If it is inconvenient for you [to come 
to Beijing], such a meeting can be held in Taipei or another 
place agreed upon.

  [Text] Beijing, June 17 (XINHUA) -- A senior leader from a 
mainland non-governmental organization sent a letter Thursday 
[17 June] to his counterpart in Taiwan, expressing hopes to meet 
again soon with the head of the Taiwan-based organization. 
  Wang Daohan, president of the Association for Relations 
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), based on the mainland, wrote 
to Ku Chen-fu, chairman of the board and secretary general of 
the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), saying that 
the latest developments in relations across the straits called 
for an urgent meeting between the two organizations. 
  Wang said that the contacts between them would help further 
increase understanding, remove misunderstandings, overcome 
differences and promote cooperation. 
  The proposed talks, he said, could explore ways to forge 
closer contacts and expand cooperation. Wang proposed that they 
should meet in Taipei, or elsewhere if Ku prefers. Wang 
recalled that in a letter earlier this year he had invited Ku to 
Beijing for talks in late spring or early summer, and that 
sources then said that Ku would be happy to meet Wang on the 
mainland. Ku also wrote recently in an article expressing his 
wish to strengthen contacts. 
  In his letter, Wang said that the Wang-Ku talks a year ago 
had ushered in an important historical step in the development 
of relations across the straits, adding that exchanges in 
various sectors have been developing vigorously, marking the 
progress made in the five talks to settle the remaining issues 
in the agreements reached between Wang and Ku during their talks 
in Singapore. 
  Wang especially noted that the talks between Tang Shubei and 
Chiao Jen-ho early this year had reached a high degree of common 
understanding concerning talks on routine issues, and had 
drafted an outline for this year's talks between the two 
organisations. 
  He said the relations across the straits had been affected 
by 
the Qiandao Lake tragedy which claimed the lives of 24 Taiwan 
tourists. But Wang spoke highly of Ku's positive and rational 
stand to safeguard the relations across the straits. 
  "Amidst the rumors and misunderstandings, we should 
intensify 
our efforts to push ahead with the talks and exchanges between 
the two sides," Wang wrote. 
  This would be in line with the original intention and would 
consolidate the achievements already made, and therefore calls 
for talks between high-ranking leaders of the ARATS and SEF as 
soon as possible, Wang added.

  [Text] The Mainland Affairs Council Tuesday [14 June] 
denied reports that Taiwan is preparing to upgrade cross strait 
relations to allow direct trade. 
  According to media reports, the council has churned out a 
document to propose that the government proceed into the second 
phase of the National Reunification Guidelines next year. The 
second phase of the guidelines allows official exchanges in 
direct trade between Taiwan and Mainland China, which are 
currently banned. The first phase currently in effect only 
allows indirect trade and civilian contacts. 
  The media reports said: The council has made a proposal 
anticipating Taiwan will join the General Agreement on Tariff 
and Trade at the end of the year. 
  A council spokesman stressed: Only after Peking recognizes 
Taipei as a political entity and stops isolating Taiwan 
internationally will the government here proceed into the second 
phase of the National Reunification Guidelines.

  [Text] Taipei, June 17 (CNA) -- The Investment Commission 
approved 49 Taiwan investment projects in Mainland China worth 
NT$1.6 [new Taiwan dollars] billion (U.S.$59 million) during its 
screening meeting Thursday [16 June], indicating that Taiwan's 
investment fever on Mainland China has not cooled. 
  The approval brought the total number of investment projects 
approved since the Qiandao incident to 233, worth more than NT$5 
billion (U.S.$185 million), a commission official said. 
  The Thursday meeting followed a May 27 meeting that approved 
93 investment projects worth NT$1.9 billion (U.S.$70 million). 
  Meanwhile, United Microelectronics Corp. also gained 
approval 
to introduce industrial technical personnel from Mainland China 
to the island. This is the first time a local enterprise is 
being allowed to import mainland expertise to Taiwan, the 
official noted.

  [Text] Beijing, June 17 (XINHUA) -- The British Hong Kong 
Government's unilateral move in announcing a series of new 
measures involving major changes to the operation of government 
departments has violated provisions of the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration. 
  Shen Guofang, spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, 
made 
the remarks here today. 
  The British Hong Kong Government announced unilaterally on 
June 16 the so-called package of measures to further enhance the 
public's access to information, Shen said. 
  The measures involve major changes to the operation of 
government departments in Hong Kong, which is detrimental to 
Hong Kong's smooth transition, he said. 
  The spokesman pointed out that in accordance with the 
relevant provisions of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, such 
matters should be discussed at the Sino-British Joint Liaison 
Group. 
  The unilateral move by the British Hong Hong Government 
without prior consultation and agreement with China is 
unacceptable to the Chinese side, he said, and thus all the 
responsibility and consequences arising therefrom shall be borne 
by the British side.

<F P=106> [By Jim Cheung, and M.Y. Sung in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] A senior government official has said that he saw 
no evidence of a thaw in Sino-British relations when he met 
senior officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs in Beijing this 
week, despite recent declarations by China that its political 
row with Britain would not thwart cooperation. Secretary for 
Trade and Industry Brian Chau was in Beijing on official 
business, when Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and director 
of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Lu Ping, declared that 
two of the biggest obstacles to Sino-British cooperation could 
quickly be resolved. 
  During his trip, Mr Chau met the affair's office Deputy 
Director Chen Ziying and department head Wang Fengchao. Mr Chau 
said while his contact with both officials was brief and 
friendly, their position had not changed since the political row 
first began. "Their attitude towards me was the same when I last 
saw them two years ago," he said. 
  In Beijing, the Foreign Ministry continued to speak of 
conciliation, but stressed that continuing cooperation depended 
on Britain's attitude. "The Chinese side hopes that 
difficulties over the question of Hong Kong will not affect ties 
between the two countries in other areas," Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Shen Guofang said. "The Chinese side is willing to 
have further cooperation with the British side. But whether it 
can be done depends on what approach and action the British side 
takes." 
  The chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions Cheng 
Yiu-tong, who led a delegation to Beijing this week, said he was 
convinced that China was determined to shelve the long-running 
political row and resume cooperation with Britain. "Mr Qian 
emphasised that the deadlock over 1994-95 electoral reform was 
over," Mr Cheng said. "He said that China would strengthen 
economic cooperation with Britain to ensure a smooth transition 
in the remaining years."

  [Text] Washington, June 16 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton said here today that the U.S. would be willing to reopen 
negotiations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
(DPRK) if the DPRK cooperates with the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  Clinton said at a White House press conference today that 
there are reports that the DPRK may have offered new steps to 
resolve its nuclear dispute with the U.S. and the IAEA. 
  In discussions with U.S. former President Jimmy Carter who 
is 
in Pyongyang for a private visit, DPRK leaders said that IAEA's 
inspectors and monitoring equipment would be left in place, 
according to Clinton. 
  The DPRK also "desires to replace its present nuclear 
program 
with a new light water reactor technology that is more resistant 
to nuclear proliferation," Clinton said. 
  Clinton said he is interested in hearing more about the 
DPRK's offer and described the latest development as a promising 
one. 
  "If today's development mean that North Korea is genuinely 
and verifiably prepared to freeze its nuclear program while 
talks go on," Clinton said, "then we would be willing to resume 
high-level talks." 
  But in the meantime, the United States will continue to 
pursue its consultations on sanction against the DPRK at the 
United Nations, Clinton added. 
  "We are hopeful that this development today will be 
positive, 
and we are awaiting further evidence," Clinton said. 
  Before Clinton made the remarks, the White House issued a 
statement, saying that "the United States welcomes indications 
given to President Carter [as received] that North Korea desires 
to find a constructive solution to the very serious issues 
between North Korea and the international community." 
  "After confirming this meaning of the message from North 
Korea in diplomatic channels, we would be prepared to go to a 
third round of talks," Assistant Secretary of State Robert 
Gallucci said in the statement. 
  "The point today, I think, for you is that there may be in 
this message a basis for returning to talks with the North 
Koreans," Gallucci said.

  [Text] Washington, June 16 (XINHUA) -- The Business 
Coalition on U.S.-China Trade issued a statement today strongly 
opposing a congressional bill seeking to re-establish links 
between the bilateral trade and human rights. 
  The bill, introduced today by four democrats, including 
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell and Representative Nancy 
Pelosy, advocates imposing sanctions on products made by the 
Chinese Liberation Army, defense-related companies and certain 
state-owned enterprises. 
  Any such sanctions bill will undermine the president's 
leadership on China policy and cripple the ability of American 
companies to compete successfully in the fast-growing China 
market, affirmed the business coalition in its statement. 
  Mitchell and Pelosy have been trying to revoke President 
Bill 
Clinton's decision on May 26 of renewing China's MFN 
[most-favored nation] status unconditionally and delinking trade 
and human rights. 
  They had also played a leading role in the Bush 
administration in attempting to impose conditions on China's MFN. 
  Approval of this bill could send confusing signals about the 
reliability of American suppliers and undermine the efforts of 
American companies to create exports, markets, and additional 
U.S. jobs, the business coalition declared. 
  "We are prepared to work with the White House and our 
Democratic and Republican allies in Congress to fight any 
legislation that threatens to undermine the president's policy," 
it added. 
  The Business Coalition on U.S.-China Trade is an umbrella 
organization of American companies and trade associations, 
representing thousands of large and small American businesses, 
farm organizations, and consumer groups that support continued 
U.S. trade with China. 
  Nearly 800 American companies and associations signed the 
coalition's letter to the president early last month urging that 
MFN be separated from human rights issues. 
  A week ago, Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to the president 
for economic policy, said that if there was any further debate 
in the congress on the issue of China's MFN, the administration 
would oppose any effort to reverse the decision the president

  [Text] Haikou, 15 Jun (XINHUA) -- China's courts have 
brought their judicial role into full play and scored notable 
achievements in conducting foreign affairs and promoting 
judicial exchanges with foreign countries. 
  According to information released by the national conference 
on the foreign affairs of courts now being held in Haikou, from 
1983 to 1993, the supreme court sent a total of 125 delegations 
(groups) of 429 people abroad for visits; received 113 foreign 
delegations of 554 members; established ties with courts in 
nearly 100 countries and regions; and conducted exchanges with 
the International Court and other international organizations. 
Beijing's successful hosting of the 14th World Law Congress in 
1990 gave a strong impetus to promoting China's judicial 
exchanges with foreign countries and won the international 
community's understanding and support. 
  In a written speech to the conference, Ren Jianxin, member 
of 
the CPC Central Committee Secretariat and president of the 
Supreme People's Court, emphasized: Courts' foreign affairs are 
an important component of the government's overall diplomacy. 
People's courts should learn from the useful experiences of 
other countries' courts in continuing to improve and perfect a 
socialist judicial system with Chinese characteristics so as to 
better fulfill the judicial tasks laid on them by the 
constitution and to better serve the socialist modernization 
drive. Courts' foreign affairs work should play a more active 
role and make greater contributions in this area.

<F P=106> [By correspondents Yang Runshi (2799 3387 2514), and Zhang </F>
Kuanming (1728 1401 2494)] 
  [Text] Nanjing, 16 Jun (XINHUA) -- "Law enforcement 
departments must work hard to build a social environment 
favorable to reform, opening up, and economic development." 
This was what Ren Jianxin, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Secretariat and secretary of the CPC Central Committee Committee 
of Politics and Law, repeatedly stressed during his inspection 
tour of Jiangsu. 
  From 8 to 16 June, Comrade Ren Jianxin inspected Jiangsu and 
chaired the national conference on comprehensive management of 
public security in rural areas. Accompanied by Li Peiyou, 
president of the Jiangsu Higher People's Court, Ren Jianxin 
inspected Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Nanjing during and after 
the conference [hui hou 2585 0683]. He also had meetings with 
local party and government leaders and comrades of law 
enforcement departments, heard briefings, had informal meetings 
with the local police, and gave important speeches. 
  In his speeches, Ren Jianxin urged law enforcement 
departments to continue to uphold the "crackdown" principle and 
by no means waver or slacken their efforts. He said: 
Proceeding from the actual state of public security, we must 
constantly sum up our experience, intensify our crackdown 
measures, increase the crackdown intensity, and, according to 
law, harshly and promptly crack down on crimes which jeopardize 
public security. He added: We must earnestly follow through 
with the guidelines laid down by the recent national conference 
on comprehensive management of public security in rural areas. 
He said: Comprehensive management of public security is a 
great innovative undertaking China has launched to maintain 
social stability. Law enforcement departments must create a 
good social environment through cracking down on crime and 
comprehensive management of public security. 
  Ren Jianxin pointed out: We must proceed with the fight 
against serious economic crimes. During the second half of the 
year, law enforcement departments must work in close 
coordination with various other departments in cracking down on 
major economic crimes, especially corruption, bribery, financial 
fraud, and smuggling. To deepen the anticorruption struggle, we 
must publicize those major cases as soon as they have been 
prosecuted and verdicts on them have been announced. 
  Wherever his inspection tour took him, Ren Jianxin stressed: 
"We must enforce the law seriously, handle all cases 
impartially, and firmly combat local protectionism." He said: 
During my current inspection tour, I have been informed by 
various quarters in all places that local protectionism is 
serious. We must attach great importance to this problem. He 
added: If we cannot enforce law impartially and if we tolerate 
local protectionism, not only will we fail to protect local 
economic interests, but we will also infringe the interests of 
the state, and even impair our own image in international 
economic relations and trade. 
  Ren Jianxin pointed out: While we want to open wider to the 
outside world and bring in more foreign capital, we must have a 
stable social environment, good technology, and a good 
infrastructure; moreover, we must also have an effective legal 
system. We must impartially handle economic disputes at home as 
well as those disputes involving foreign concerns, and we must 
protect the legitimate rights and interests of various parties 
concerned on an equal footing according to law. 
  "Managing the police strictly and building stronger police 
force contingents" is another priority which Ren Jianxin 
underscored during his inspection tour in Jiangsu. He said: We 
must firmly combat the unethical conduct of a small number of 
law enforcement personnel. Law enforcers who have violated law 
and discipline must be firmly dealt with. Effective measures 
must be devised to increase the fighting power of law 
enforcement personnel so that they will become the bulwark on 
which the party and the people can depend and which can maintain 
social stability.

<F P=106> [By reporter Sun Yong (1327 0516); Beijing XINHUA Domestic </F>
Service in Chinese at 1503 GMT on 16 June transmits a service 
message replacing the following item] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Jun (XINHUA) -- A meeting to mark the 
70th founding anniversary of the Huangpu [Whampoa] Military 
Academy and the 10th anniversary of the Huangpu Military Academy 
Alumni Association took place at the Great Hall of the People 
this afternoon. 
  Li Peng, Hu Jintao, Qian Qichen, Zhang Zhen, Qin Jiwei, 
Cheng 
Siyuan, Li Peiyao, Yang Rudai, Wang Zhaoguo, Ngapoi Ngawang 
Jigmei, Sepydin Aza, Hong Xuezhi, Wan Guoquan and others 
attended the commemorations, or had their pictures taken with 
representatives of the military academy's alumni prior to the 
commemorations. 
  Li Ruihuan addressed the meeting. He began his speech by 
extending the CPC Central Committee's warm greetings and sincere 
regards to the alumni and to the academy's teachers and cadets 
at home and abroad. Li Ruihuan said: Huangpu Military Academy 
was founded 70 years ago by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and Chinese 
communists represented by Zhou Enlai. Now 70 years have gone by 
and the Chinese people led by the CPC and Comrade Mao Zedong 
have accomplished the democratic revolution, which Dr. Sun 
Yat-sen did not accomplish, and developed this revolution into a 
socialist revolution. Achieving our motherland's peaceful 
reunification accords with the will of the people, it is what 
our nation wants, and it is also a sacred mission for Chinese 
people of all nationalities, including our countrymen in Taiwan. 
I hope Huangpu alumni on the two sides of the strait will unite 
and contribute more to our motherland's reunification and 
China's revitalization. (full text of the speech will be 
transmitted separately) 
  Addressing the commemoration, Li Moan, vice president of the 
Huangpu Military Academy Alumni Association, said: In the past 
we joined the whole nation in fighting the big powers and 
eliminating the warlords. Earthshaking changes have now taken 
place in our great motherland, and people throughout the country 
are advancing triumphantly under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. Since its founding 10 years ago, the Huangpu 
Military Academy Alumni Association has been making unswerving 
efforts to foster the academy's spirit, establish ties with 
alumni, promote the motherland's reunification, and to dedicate 
itself to revitalizing China. Our association has already 
established contacts with nearly 1,000 alumni in Taiwan as well 
as alumni in more than 10 countries and regions. When 
contacting alumni in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, and overseas 
areas, our association has seized every opportunity to expound 
the nation's policy toward Taiwan -- a policy characterized by 
"peaceful reunification; and one country, two systems." We have 
also done many things useful for the introduction of capital, 
technology, and proficient personnel; and for promoting the 
development of relations and exchanges between the two sides of 
the strait. 
  Zhou Lejun, a Huangpu alumnus from Taiwan, also addressed 
the 
occasion. He said: The meritorious services which Huangpu 
alumni performed during the eastern and northern expeditions and 
the War of Resistance Against Japan have gone down in history. 
We are pleased to note the exchanges between alumni on the two 
sides of the strait today. We should broaden our vision and, as 
brothers, we should by no means be engaged in quarrel. We are 
absolutely against separation; and even more so are we against 
intervention by foreign forces and the obstruction of our great 
motherland's reunification. I hope Huangpu alumni will work hard 
together so that the great cause of reunification can be 
achieved at an early date. 
  The commemoration meeting was called by the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee. 
Ye Xuanping, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, 
chaired the meeting, which was attended by Huangpu alumni at 
home and from abroad and people of all walks of life in Beijing 
-- more than 500 in total. 
  In the evening, the CPPCC National Committee and the CPC 
Central Committee United Front Department hosted a banquet at 
the Great Hall of the People to mark the 70th founding 
anniversary of the Huangpu Military Academy and the 10th 
anniversary of the Huangpu Military Academy Alumni Association. 
Wang Zhaoguo delivered a toast at the banquet.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Chuangen (4545 0278 2704)] </F>
  [Text] Guiyang, 14 Jun (XINHUA) -- When Qiao Shi, member of 
the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau and chairman of the National People's Congress Standing 
Committee, inspected Guizhou, he pointed out: Guizhou must 
cherish the opportunity, proceed from its actual conditions, 
speed up the pace of development, continue to emancipate the 
mind, persist in reconstruction through its own efforts, make 
full use of its own favorable conditions, further arouse the 
initiative of the masses of all nationalities and the vast 
numbers of party members and cadres, and extensively absorb 
favorable factors in all quarters so as to enable a landlocked 
province which is not located in a coastal area, along the Chang 
Jiang, or in a border areas to gradually advance along the road 
of economic development with big strides. 
  Accompanied by Liu Fangren, Guizhou Provincial CPC Committee 
secretary; Guizhou Governor Chen Shineng; and Wang Chaowen, 
Guizhou Provincial People's Congress chairman; Qiao Shi drove 
more than 1,000 km between 7 and 14 June in his inspection tour 
of Duyun city, the capital of the Qiannan Bouyei-Miao Autonomous 
Prefecture; Kaili County; the capital of the Qiandongnan 
Miao-Dong Autonomous Prefecture, and the counties of Libo, 
Sandu, and Leishan, which are under the jurisdiction of the 
aforementioned two capitals. During his inspection tour, Qiao 
Shi visited factories, schools; villages inhabited by the Yao, 
Shui, and Miao minority nationalities; and some peasant 
households, and he got in touch with cadres, workers, peasants, 
and teachers of various nationalities to understand the 
situation of their production, livelihood, education, and 
efforts to become well-off. Qiao Shi was very pleased to see 
that these areas inhabited by minority nationalities enjoy 
economic development and social stability, that the living 
standards of the masses in these areas have been improved, and 
that various nationalities there get along with one another 
peacefully and harmoniously. At Miaoliang village in Sandu Shui 
Autonomous County, and at the Langdeshang village in Leishan 
County, Qiao Shi watched song and dance performances with a 
strong minority-nationalities flavor staged by villagers and was 
invited to dance with villagers of fraternal nationalities. 
  After having listened to work reports by the provincial 
party 
committee, the provincial people's congress, and the provincial 
government, Qiao Shi pointed out that now is an extremely good 
period for China's construction and development. He reviewed 
the modern history of China since the Opium War, analyzed 
various current international and domestic conditions favorable 
to China's economic construction, and encouraged everyone to 
gain a profound understanding of Comrade Xiaoping's important 
instructions so as to seize the opportunity to successfully 
promote Guizhou's economic construction. 
  Touching on Guizhou's economic work, Qiao Shi said: Guizhou 
is a landlocked province "which is not located in a coastal 
area, along the Chang Jiang, or in a border area." Mountains 
and hills account for 97 percent of its area. Impoverished 
people inhabit a relatively great portion of its area. Indeed, 
it faces big difficulties. True, it needs the central 
authorities' support and all quarters' help to solve these 
difficulties; however, in the final analysis, it must depend on 
itself. Above all, we must be aware of the fact that Guizhou 
has tremendous potential and many favorable conditions. It is 
necessary for Guizhou to closely rely on the masses of the 
people and to make full use of its favorable conditions to 
invigorate the economic sector and to successfully promote 
economic development. 
  The Guizhou provincial party committee and Guizhou 
Provincial 
Government always place agriculture and rural work at the top of 
the agenda of their economic work. Qiao Shi fully affirmed 
their practice. He said: Guizhou has achieved great successes 
in promoting agricultural development. However, it is still 
necessary for Guizhou to be more farsighted and to actually 
acquire a large-scale agriculture mentality when carrying out 
tasks in all fields of endeavor. Guizhou has very great 
potential for agricultural development. While doing a good job 
of grain production, Guizhou can develop animal husbandry and 
aquaculture and increase the output of orchards, tea, mulberry 
trees and silkworms, medicinal materials, and other cash crops. 
Meanwhile, it can develop town and township enterprises and, in 
particular, processing enterprises by basing itself on local raw 
and semifinished materials. After economic development has 
progressed to a certain extent, it can establish a group of 
small cities and towns in a planned way and under proper 
guidance to promote the development of rural areas to a higher 
level. The surplus labor force in rural areas can be organized 
to participate in the construction of highways, water 
conservancy projects, and other types of infrastructure so as to 
bring their role into full play. 
  Qiao Shi pointed out: Guizhou is endowed with very 
abundant resources and, in particular, with very abundant energy 
resources and nonferrous metals. Guizhou must make full use of 
its favorable condition -- "being endowed with a sea of coal 
south of the Chang Jiang." Meanwhile, it must also accelerate 
the tapping of its abundant water resources. It can build 
thermal power and hydropower stations at the same time. Because 
Guizhou already has a considerably solid foundation for the 
production of aluminum, coupled with adequate electric energy, 
the prospects for Guizhou's aluminum production are very good. 
Guizhou must strive to do a better job of building arterial and 
main highways to facilitate a linkup with major highways in 
neighboring provinces and regions, as well as in forming a 
network of them. Meanwhile, Guizhou must mobilize and organize 
the forces of all quarters to speed up construction in other 
fields. Of course, all these things must be carried out in a 
planned way and step by step. Close attention must be paid to 
vigorously developing, by every means possible, the projects for 
which the basic conditions already exist. 
  Qiao Shi stressed: Generally speaking, to accelerate 
development, Guizhou must rely on fully arousing the initiative 
of the 34 million people of various nationalities in the whole 
province. Meanwhile, it must strive to win the support of and 
help from the central authorities and relevant departments, and 
it must strengthen lateral ties and cooperation with fraternal 
provinces, municipalities, and regions. In addition, it must 
speed up the pace of reform and opening up, and do a good job of 
carrying out the construction of tangible- and 
intangible-investment-environment projects to attract more 
foreign funds and types of technology. In short, I hope that 
you comrades of Guizhou will further emancipate your minds, 
broaden your horizons, take a wider road, and adopt more methods 
in a bid to promote more rapid economic development in Guizhou. 
  Touching on the work of people's congresses, Qiao Shi 
stressed: It is necessary to strengthen the building of 
socialist democracy, laws, and regulations and to establish a 
legal system suited to a socialist market economy in accordance 
with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. He said: The missions undertaken by 
people's congresses are very heavy and important. The work of 
people's congresses at all levels, including legislation, the 
publicizing of laws and regulations, and the supervision of law 
enforcement, must be improved. He said: The forces from all 
walks of life must be mobilized to establish a legal system 
suited to a socialist market economy. It is also a process of 
broadly developing democracy. He pointed out: Improving the 
work of people's congresses at the grass-roots level has very 
important significance for strengthening party building, 
political power, and laws and regulations at the grass-roots 
level. 
  Qiao Shi expressed the belief that the people of various 
nationalities in Guizhou will surely be able to build Guizhou 
into a better province by adhering to the party's basic line, 
deepening reform, and opening up wider under the leadership of 
the provincial party committee and provincial government.

  [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua 
this afternoon made an inspection of the Beijing International 
Telecommunications Center and an experimental base of the 
Ministry of Railways. 
  Zou, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of China, visited some parts of 
the telecommunications center, including a wireless and digital 
optic-fiber, high-frequency system and an international 
telephone exchange center. 
  The center, set up in 1987, is an important link in China's 
national telecommunications network which transmits 
international telephone, telegraph and electronic data into or 
out of China. 
  Zou asked about the center's operation and encouraged staff 
to keep China in the sector's forefront. 
  On his tour of the base in the Science Research Institute 
under the Ministry of Railways, Zou boarded an in-trial 
para-high-speed train, which will run from Guangzhou, capital of 
south China's Guangdong Province, to Shenzhen, China's boomtown 
in the reform drive. 
  The passenger train, made entirely in China, is designed to 
run 180 kilometers per hour and is equipped with air 
conditioning in every car. 
  Zou discussed technological and management issues with 
engineers at the base.

  [Text] Chengdu, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's 
Sichuan Province plans to invest up to 100 billion yuan (about 
11.5 billion U.S. dollars) in the construction of energy 
projects before the end of this century in a bid to ease the 
power shortage which is plaguing its economic development. 
  Rich in natural resources, Sichuan boasts the biggest 
hydroelectric power and natural gas reserves in the country. 
  The province has mapped out an ambitious plan to exploit its 
hydroelectric power, natural gas and coal resources. The 
investment needed will come from the state, provincial and local 
governments along with overseas investment and funds raised by 
enterprises. 
  Already, power stations with a total investment of 30 
billion 
yuan (about 3.4 billion U.S. dollars) are being built across the 
province. These power stations will be able to provide a total 
of 6.5 million kw of electricity a year by the time they are 
completed. 
  The province plans to set aside another 60 billion yuan over 
the next few years on more such construction projects. Local 
governments are also building smaller ones with a total annual 
capacity of 1.3 million kw. 
  As China's second-largest coal producer, Sichuan is busy 
developing coal mines which will be able to supply 2.97 million 
tons of coal annually. 
  A natural gas field which can supply 1.3 million cu m of 
natural gas a year has been completed, and another of similar 
size is being planned. 
  Natural gas development and energy saving projects in China 
have been listed as loan projects by the World Bank for the 1994 
fiscal year with 255 million U.S. dollars in loans and 10 
million U.S. dollars in free aid.

<F P=106> [By NEIMENGGU RIBAO reporter Wang Rantong (3769 3544 1749) </F>
and Inner Mongolia People's Broadcasting Station reporter Niu 
Yaming (3662 0068 5407): "Inner Mongolia's Situation in Economic 
Development, Social Stability, Nationality Unity Is Excellent, 
and It Has Boundless Future in Accelerating Development and 
Great Hope To Be Among the Best"] 
  [Text] On the afternoon of 31 May, the Inner Mongolia 
Autonomous Regional Party Committee held a situation report 
meeting. Wang Qun, secretary of the autonomous regional party 
committee and chairman of the regional people's congress 
standing committee, pointed out at the meeting: Since this 
year, the economic development, social stability, and 
nationality unity in Inner Mongolia have forged ahead very well, 
and, especially, the adaptability to and control over the 
transition to a socialist market economic system have 
continuously strengthened. Inner Mongolia has boundless 
prospects to speed up development and great hope to be ranked 
among the best. 
  Attending the meeting were Qian Fenyong, Bai Enpei, and Wang 
Zhan, deputy secretaries, and Wuyunqimuge, standing committee 
member of the autonomous regional party committee. Also 
attending were leaders of the regional people's congress 
standing committee, government, and committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]; responsible 
persons of the departments of the regional party committee; 
responsible persons of the standing committee and various 
committees of the regional people's congress; responsible 
persons of the regional departments in charge of overall 
responsibilities; and responsible persons of the regional press 
and propaganda units. 
  Wang Qun expounded the region's current excellent situation 
from 10 aspects. He held: In the first five months of this 
year, party committees, people's congresses, governments, and 
CPPCC committees at all levels and the cadres and masses of 
various nationalities in the region did a great amount of 
fruitful work and achieved a marked success in conscientiously 
implementing the 20-character guideline of "grasping 
opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider to the outside 
world, promoting development, and maintaining stability," which 
was issued by the party Central Committee. Inner Mongolia has 
maintained a good developing situation in the process of 
establishing a socialist market economic system. Generally 
speaking, the situation of Inner Mongolia is very good. 
  Wang Qun pointed out: First, a good situation has prevailed 
in the region's economic development of industry, agriculture, 
and animal husbandry. Rural and pastoral areas have been 
prosperous; the people have been intent on advancement; and 
animal husbandry has reaped another bumper harvest. In 
agriculture, sown areas have been expanded, and the farming 
structure has been positively readjusted, making it most 
possible for peasants and herdsmen to increase their income by 
100 yuan over last year. A more gratifying achievement is that 
new headway has been made by the broad masses of peasants and 
herdsmen in adapting themselves to the socialist market economic 
system. Although industrial production confronted many 
difficulties and problems on the way of reform, Inner Mongolia's 
enterprises at and above the township level achieved an output 
value of 10.594 billion yuan in the January-April period, up 
11.1 percent from the corresponding period of last year. The 
ranking of our development speed rose from 24th in the country 
to 16th as compared with the corresponding period of last year. 
State-owned medium and small-sized enterprises have developed 
more rapidly than large and medium-sized enterprises; and the 
development speed of collective enterprises, the "three types of 
foreign-funded enterprises," joint-stock enterprises, and 
individual enterprises has outstripped that of the enterprises 
owned by the whole people. Especially the township enterprises 
have increased by a large margin, showing their characteristics 
of strong adaptability and flexibility to the market economic 
system. The large-scale increase of the tertiary industry, 
commodity circulation, service trades is also heartening. 
Second, tax revenue has increased synchronously. The financial 
revenue of the whole region in the January-April period of this 
year increased by 12 percent over the corresponding period of 
last year, and taxes increased by 20.5 percent. Commodity 
prices have been stable basically, and the level of commodity 
prices has been lower than the national average. This proves 
that the reform of the state's financial system has developed 
steadily and yielded good results. Third, urban and rural people 
have made gratifying progress in adapting themselves to and 
controlling over the socialist market economic activities. The 
concept of "finding the market instead of the mayor" has been 
accepted by more and more people. People have come to 
understand more how to follow the guidance of the market to 
readjust the structure of farming and livestock breeding, to 
take the road of merging into groups and exploiting small areas, 
and to develop a coordinated economy. In this aspect, many 
typical examples have sprung up in many areas, and a wealth of 
experiences have been accumulated. Fourth, the accelerated 
development of the state's key industries and basic industries 
in Inner Mongolia will certainly push the region's economy to 
develop fast. At present, the state is accelerating the pace in 
implementing the preferential policy in minority nationality 
areas. We should grasp the opportunity, make use of the party 
and state's preferential policy to minority nationality areas to 
speed up the region's economic construction by every possible 
means, make efforts to construct the region into China's largest 
base of agriculture, animal husbandry, sideline production, and 
foodstuff industry, and construct it into the state's important 
energy base. The central authority's policy to enrich the 
country and to strengthen the border area will certainly bring 
very favorable opportunity for Inner Mongolia's development, and 
Inner Mongolia's prospect is boundless and full of hope. Fifth, 
reform, opening up, and the endeavor of bringing in investment 
from abroad and developing lateral cooperation at home have 
greatly pushed forward the unconventional development of the 
region's township enterprises, "three types of foreign-funded 
enterprises," and individual enterprises. 
  Township 
enterprise is the promising and the only means to enrich the 
broad masses of peasants and herdsmen and also to develop the 
region's economy. The increase rate of the region's township 
enterprises in the first four months of this year was registered 
at 119 percent. Township enterprises have slashed a road of 
development characterized by little input, high yield, and high 
efficiency, thus demonstrating their great vitality. The region 
has also the six large backbone industries, such as coal, 
electricity, chemical, and light and textile industries. As 
long as our understanding is unified and the leadership and the 
rank and file are of one mind and do their utmost together, the 
development of Inner Mongolia will certainly be accelerated, and 
it is very possible for it to be "ranked among the best." 
Sixth, the 3 million people of all nationalities have fired the 
first shot of the fight to shake off poverty and to get rich, 
and the victory in shaking off poverty and getting rich in six 
years is within grasp. The key is that the higher and lower 
levels should take the matter seriously and unite and work hard. 
To unite in the fight is the key to winning victory. This 
fight should be made successful at any cost. We may adopt the 
means of coordinating state's support with the self-reliance and 
arduous efforts of the masses, supporting the poor with 
intellectual resources, science, and technology, and sending 
persons to selected poverty-stricken areas to help improve their 
work. People at higher and lower levels of the whole region 
should unite as one, work hard together, and put into effect the 
party, the state, and the region's every support-the-poor policy 
and measure. Seventh, the endeavors to rejuvenate the region 
with science and technology and to do a good job in 
comprehensive service are developing from the past decentralized 
pattern characterized by each doing his own way into a new 
pattern suitable to the market economy, which is characterized 
by a broad sphere, a merging into groups, coordination of 
agriculture, industry, animal husbandry with trade and 
technology, and combination of companies with peasant 
households. What the market demands is what technology will 
serve to produce. The concept of the victory belonging to the 
superior in market competition is being accepted by more and 
more producers and managers. Winning by superior quality and 
aiming at improving efficiency have become the irresistible 
development trends in rejuvenating the region with science and 
technology and improving comprehensive service. Eighth, being 
built on a fine basis, the ecotypic agriculture and animal 
husbandry of good economic efficiency are developing more 
rapidly. The region's agriculture and animal husbandry have 
already had a nice basis, and the ecotype and good economic 
efficiency are the higher demands on the development of 
agricultural and animal husbandry production. In ecological 
construction and environmental protection, the region has the 
precious experiences of "growing trees, growing grass, and 
growing shrubs," and "turning cultivated land back to forests or 
pastures." We should further spread these experiences to have 
them yield positive results throughout the region. Party 
committees, people's congresses, governments, and CPPCC 
committees at all levels in the region should, according to 
their own duties, do a good job in the work which has a 
strategic meaning to benefit future generations. Ninth, to be 
actively intent on advancement and to be united and stable are 
another characteristic of the region's situation. That people 
of all nationalities in the region help each other and achieve 
progress and prosperity together has become a common practice. 
Cadres of all nationalities and the broad masses of the people 
have shared comforts and hardships, communist party members have 
set the example of carrying on the fine tradition of the party, 
and the socialist style has been carried forward. A number of 
heroes and models have emerged in this. Organizational 
departments and propaganda departments at all levels should make 
great efforts to carry forward the new practice of the times and 
publicize advanced and heroic deeds to further develop the good 
situation characterized by active efforts in making progress, 
unity, and stability. Tenth, the leadership has been 
strengthened, style of work has been improved, and the guideline 
of attaching equal importance to and achieving success in two 
tasks at the same time has been carried out further. When 
building the socialist material civilization, leaders at all 
levels have had high enthusiasm for building the socialist 
spiritual civilization, and their measures have been powerful 
and achievements conspicuous. Stressing lofty ideals, morality, 
styles, and discipline has become the common wish and action of 
cadres and masses of all nationalities. Comrade Wang Qun 
pointed out that the ten aspects described above were the major 
indicators of the region's excellent situation. 
  Wang Qun pointed out: We should attach much importance to 
the existing problems and difficulties, though facing the good 
situation. Problems such as the development of enterprises, 
banner and county's finance, and commodity prices should all be 
taken very seriously by leaders at all levels. As long as the 
people at higher and lower levels of the region work hard 
together, these problems that have occurred in the process of 
progress and development can be totally overcome and resolved. 
The whole region's cadres and masses of all nationalities 
should persistently carry out the basic line of the party, take 
the 20-character guideline of the party Central Committee as the 
guide, uplift spirit, work hard together, adopt positive 
measures to solve the practical problems we have faced, and 
consolidate and develop the region's excellent situation which 
has been hard-won.

  [Text] Shenyang, June 17 (XINHUA) -- An export commodity 
trade fair will be held from July 1 to 10 in Dalian, a coastal 
open city in north-east China's Liaoning Province. 
  More than 3,000 overseas business people from over 50 
countries and regions are expected to take part in the fair 
where a vast range of export commodities will be on display. 
  Jointly sponsored by eight north-eastern provinces and 
cities, including Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces and 
the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the fair will be the 
biggest of the sort staged so far in China, according to an 
official leading the Liaoning trade delegation. 
  The three provinces in northeast China and the Inner 
Mongolia 
have jointly staged seven such fairs since 1987, with a total 
trade volume of about 3.3 billion U.S. dollars and cooperative 
projects signed worth about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars. 
  Commodities to be on show include products of grain and 
edible oil, hardware, minerals, garments, textiles, special 
local products, arts and crafts, machinery, electronics, autos, 
medical and health equipment, and non-metal products. 
  Products from many foreign-funded joint ventures will also 
be 
on display. 
  A large number of projects in energy resources, transport 
and 
traffic, telecommunications, real estate, business, finance and 
banking, tourism and joint development of industrial parks, will 
be ready for cooperation with overseas investors. 
  The '94 Liaoning Trade Fair for Foreign Economic and 
Technological Cooperation will be held at the same time. 
  According to a Taiwan affairs official of Liaoning 
provincial 
government, the local government will give preferential 
treatment to business people from Taiwan since they have shown 
special interests in investment in northeast China in the past 
few years.

  [Text] Urumqi, June 15 (XINHUA) -- More than 300,000 
families of farmers and herdsmen in northwest China's Xinjiang 
Uygur Autonomous Region have eliminated poverty in the past few 
years thanks to scientific progress. 
  According to statistics from the region, it had 353,700 poor 
families comprising more than 1.6 million people by the end of 
1985. 
  To help these people shake off poverty, the region put more 
efforts into teaching them agricultural technologies and 
techniques rather than simply giving them money as before. 
  The regional commission of science and technology, the 
regional women's federation and the agricultural department of 
the region have composed a complete program to aid the poor by 
setting up evening schools and training classes and offering 
correspondence courses and hands-on teaching. 
  By now, about 85 percent of the poor farmers and herdsmen 
have mastered one or two practical techniques. 
  The region has also sent thousands of scientists and 
technicians to the grassroots level to help the poor people. 
  As the region suffers from a lack of rain, the regional 
government began to build 90 irrigation works in 1986. Now it 
has poured 300 million yuan into these projects, among which 46 
have been completed. 
  These projects have increased the reservoir water reserve of 
the region by 90 million cubic meters and irrigated more than 
80,000 hectares of farmlands and grasslands.

<F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, June 17 (CNA) -- The Beijing-based 
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) on 
Friday [17 June] renewed its call for a high-level meeting with 
its Taiwan counterpart to discuss ways to promote cross-strait 
dialogue and rapprochement. 
  ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan faxed a message to C.F. Ku, 
president of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) early in 
the morning suggesting that the two meet either in Taipei or a 
third place to exchange views on matters of mutual concern and 
on ways to boost cooperation between the two intermediary 
organizations. 
  Wang said SEF and ARATS should work even closer and harder 
to 
promote cross-strait dialogue and various civilian exchanges in 
the wake of the Qiandao Lake travel disaster, in which 24 Taiwan 
tourists were killed. 
  This was the second time Wang has pushed for a meeting with 
Ku this year. He also invited Ku to visit Beijing for 
high-level talks earlier in the year, but Ku did not accept that 
invitation. 
  Cross-strait relations have remained at a low ebb since the 
March 31 tragedy on Qiandao Lake, which is in Zhejiang Province 
in southeastern China. 
  Wang said in his latest letter that a high-level SEF-ARATS 
meeting is needed to reaffirm their good will toward each other 
and mend their differences over some cross-strait disputes. 
  SEF Deputy Secretary-General Li Ching-ping said Wang's warm- 
hearted overture is laudable, adding that Wang's message had 
already been relayed to Ku, who is currently on a European tour. 
  Li said SEF will discuss with the Mainland Affairs Council, 
which oversees SEF operations, how to respond to Wang's letter 
after Ku returns. 
  Ku and Wang met in Singapore in April 1993 for the first 
time 
to lay a framework for SEF-ARATS exchanges. Several agreements 
were signed during the historic Ku-Wang meeting for 
institutionalized bilateral contacts. 
  However, follow-up meetings between SEF and ARATS officials 
failed to proceed as smoothly as expected. 
  SEF and ARATS are unofficial conduits for cross-strait 
exchanges in the absence of official ties.

  [Text] Taipei, June 16 (CNA) -- The Beijing-based 
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) is 
stepping up contacts with Taiwan investors in Mainland China in 
an attempt to have them cut their relations with Taiwan, a 
high-ranking mainland affairs official said Thursday [16 June]. 
  Huang Kun-hui, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council 
(MAC), said during a cabinet meeting that ARATS Chairman Wang 
Daohan and Standing Vice Chairman Tang Shubei have visited many 
southeastern mainland cities where a number of Taiwan-owned 
companies are located, including Ningbo, Hangzhou, Nanjing, 
Yangzhou, Wuxi and Suzhou, since mid-May. 
  Wang and Tang have met intensively with senior executives of 
Taiwan-invested firms during their tours of those cities, Huang 
said. They have also held face-to-face talks with Taiwan youths 
studying there. 
  [Words indistinct] might be aiming to win back the hearts of 
Taiwan businessmen whose confidence in mainland authorities has 
been adversely affected by the Qiandao Lake travel disaster in 
which 24 tourists were killed, Huang noted. 
  "The two might also be implementing resolutions reached 
during a Beijing meeting in April on a new strategy toward 
Taiwan to intensify courting Taiwan investors," Huang said. 
  Huang also said that ARATS has adopted a sugar-coated 
conciliatory approach to win the trust of Taiwan businessmen. 
"Wang seems to be talking Taiwan investors into believing that 
ARATS can speak for them and protect their interests and rights 
on the mainland," he explained. 
  On the other hand, he said ARATS has deliberately ignored 
the 
call from the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) for 
cooperation in assisting mainland China-based Taiwan companies 
to resolve their problems. 
  "By doing so, ARATS aims to alienate Taiwan companies from 
the SEF," Huang said, adding that ARATS hopes those firms will 
in the long run exclusively turn to it for assistance and 
gradually cut their ties with their homeland. 
  The SEF and ARATS are semi-official bodies set up by their 
respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in the 
absence of official contacts.

  [Text] Seoul, June 18 (XINHUA) -- Former U.S. President 
Jimmy Carter returned here from Pyongyang via the truce village 
of Panmunjom this morning after a four-day visit to the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) during which he 
held talks with President Kim Il-song on resolving the nuclear 
issue. 
  Carter is expected to brief South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam on the results of his two rounds of talks with the DPRK 
leader. 
  During their second round of talks in Pyongyang on Friday, 
Carter told Kim that the U.S. had suspended its moves to apply 
sanctions against the DPRK, while Kim declared that he had 
authorized a joint search for Americans missing in action (MIA) 
from the 1950-1953 Korean War. 
  The news appeared to signal a breakthrough in the nuclear 
crisis on the Korean peninsula, with Carter describing the MIA 
initiative as a "good omen for the future." 
  "I would like to inform you that they have stopped the 
sanctions activity in the United Nations," Carter told Kim at 
their talks. 
  The former U.S. President also said that Washington had 
"provisionally agreed" to hold a third round of high-level talks 
with Pyongyang, and added that he was passing on the message 
after consultations with the White House. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton said on Thursday that his 
country 
would resume high-level talks with the DPRK if signals from 
Pyongyang indicated that it was willing to freeze its nuclear 
program. 
  The U.S. and the DPRK held two rounds of high-level talks on 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula in June and July last 
year. The third round of talks, which was scheduled for March 21 
this year, was cancelled because of differences between the two 
sides. 
  Kim told Carter during their first round of talks on 
Thursday 
that two inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) would be allowed to remain in the DPRK rather than be 
expelled, a gesture of conciliation in Pyongyang's nuclear row 
with Washington and its allies. 
  Carter passed through the heavily-fortified border village 
of 
Panmunjom on Wednesday on his way to Pyongyang after meeting 
South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, Deputy Prime Minister and 
National Unification Board (NUB) Minister Yi Hong-ku, and 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu during a three-day visit to Seoul. 
  He said earlier that his trip to the Korean peninsula would 
be a private one. "My hope is to discuss some of the important 
issues of the day with leaders in the area," he explained. 
  Recently the U.S., after consultations with South Korea and 
Japan, drafted a resolution calling for United Nations sanctions 
against the DPRK when it banned IAEA inspectors from testing 
samples of nuclear fuel to determine whether it had been 
diverted secretly to make atomic weapons. 
  Pyongyang warned that any sanctions aimed at forcing it to 
accept inspections would be regarded as a declaration of war, 
while insisting that its nuclear program was entirely peaceful. 
  On Monday, the DPRK announced that it was withdrawing 
immediately from the IAEA, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, 
and would accept no more inspections of its nuclear program, in 
retaliation for the agency's own sanctions resolution against 
Pyongyang. The resolution provided for an immediate halt to 
IAEA technical assistance to the DPRK totaling 250,000 U.S. 
dollars a year. 
  Before meeting president Kim Yong-sam here today, Carter 
will 
meet Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu to discuss the steps that 
Seoul and Washington can take to deal with the nuclear issue, 
based on the outcome of his talks in Pyongyang, official sources 
here say. 
  The former president is to meet the press here this 
afternoon 
before leaving for the United States.

  [Text] Seoul, June 18 (XINHUA) -- President of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Kim Il-song has 
said that his country is willing to freeze its nuclear program 
if Washington agrees to hold a third round of high-level talks 
with Pyongyang, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter quoted Kim 
Il-song as saying today. 
  "President Kim Il-song said that North Korea (DPRK) would 
freeze its nuclear program, but with assurance that a third 
round of talks would take place and that North Korea could 
replace the present nuclear reactor system," Carter said at a 
press conference. 
  "But he did not agree to permanent freezing of the nuclear 
exercises, nuclear activities in North Korea," Carter said, 
adding that Kim Il-song made it clear that this is possible 
"only if there is assurance of light water reactor technology 
being available to North Korea." 
  Carter returned here Saturday [18 June] morning via the 
truce 
village of Panmunjom following his four-day private visit to the 
DPRK. He passed through Panmunjom Wednesday on his way to 
Pyongyang after meeting with South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam, Deputy Prime Minister and National Unification Board 
(NUB) Minister Yi Hong-ku and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu 
during his three-day visit to Seoul. 
  The former U.S. President, who met with President Kim 
Il-song 
twice during his stay in Pyongyang, said that the DPRK leader 
has made two specific requests. 
  One is that the U.S. would support the DPRK's desire to 
replace graphite moderated reactor with light water reactor and 
the other is that the DPRK be assured officially it will not be 
subject to nuclear attack from the U.S. or other outside forces, 
Carter said. 
  He noted that President Kim Il-song would like that to be 
done within the context of the joint declaration of the DPRK and 
South Korea concerning denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. 
  Washington, Carter said, is willing to reassure the DPRK 
against nuclear attack and to support inter-Korean agreement on 
denuclearization. 
  "I was authorized to say that in the context of the 
North-South Korean declaration on denuclearization, that the 
U.S. will be willing to join in on such assurance," he said. 
  Carter quoted Kim Il-song as saying that the DPRK never has 
planned to "develop nuclear weapons." 
  He clarified what appeared to be the major discrepancy 
between him and U.S. President Bill Clinton after reports on 
Friday evening that Carter informed Kim Il-song that the U.S. 
stopped discussing sanctions at the United Nations and agreed to 
hold the next round of high-level talks with Pyongyang. 
  "I informed President Kim that in my opinion, if (North 
Korean) commitments were carried out, the need or effort of 
sanctions would be put in abeyance and that the third round of 
talks would be rescheduled soon to resolve all the issues 
related to the nuclear issue," Carter said. 
  Referring to the effect of sanctions against the DPRK, 
Carter 
said, "I don't think that threat of sanctions has any effect at 
all as far as damage to its economy, society is concerned." 
  While briefing South Korean President Kim Yong-sam on his 
Pyongyang visit this morning, Carter also conveyed President Kim 
Il-song's proposal for an inter-Korean summit. Kim Yong-sam 
accepted the proposal forthwith. 
  Carter, who was visiting the Korean peninsula in a private 
capacity, is expected to brief the Clinton administration as 
soon as he returns to the U.S. on Saturday evening.

<F P=106> ["Carter: Nuclear Crisis in DPRK Is Over"] </F>
  [Text] Washington, June 19 (XINHUA) -- Former president of 
the United States Jimmy Carter said here today he thought that 
the crisis with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) 
is over. 
  Carter told reporters after meeting with U.S. Administration 
officials at the White House that as far as he was concerned, 
"there are no unanswered questions" following his talks with 
DPRK leaders on how to resolve the unclear crisis. 
  Carter, who returned from the DPRK on Saturday [18 June], 
had 
about two-hour meetings at the White House with National 
Security Adviser Tony Lake, Assistant Secretary of State Robert 
Gallucci, Assistant Secretary of State for Asia Winston Lord and 
other officials. 
  Before speaking to reporters, Carter talked by telephone for 
about half an hour with U.S. President Bill Clinton, who is 
spending the weekend at Camp David. 
  "I personally believe that the crisis is over," Carter said, 
"and I personally believe that Kim Il-song wants to be sure that 
the crisis is over." 
  "I personally don't see any need to proceed with the 
sanctions unless there is some violation of the agreement I have 
received," Carter stressed. 
  Carter said he expected the third round of talks between the 
U.S. and the DPRK could be arranged within the next few weeks 
and that confirmation of the latest agreements through 
diplomatic channels could get under way as soon as this week. 
  "It may well be that President Carter has brought back 
something upon which we can build and defuse the situation," 
Gallucci told reporters after Carter left the White House. 
  He said the Clinton administration would move as quickly as 
possible to meet with DPRK officials and discuss the proposals 
brought back by Carter. 
  However, Lake said that the United States's efforts to 
obtain 
sanctions against the DPRK would only be suspended after formal 
talks between the two countries begin. 
  "In the meantime," Lake said, "we are continuing to consult 
on the sanctions" at the United Nations.

  [Text] Washington, June 18 (XINHUA) -- Most Americans 
support the U.S. Administration to resume talks with the 
Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea (DPRK), a NEWSWEEK 
magazine poll said today. 
  The poll showed that nearly 68 percent of 499 Americans 
interviewed by telephone believed the United States should 
resume talks with the DPRK. 
  Twenty-five percent were against resuming talks before 
inspections on the DPRK's nuclear facilities, and seven percent 
said they didn't know, the poll said. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton said Thursday [19 Jun] that the 
U.S. would be willing to resume high-level talks with the DPRK 
if the DPRK is ready to freeze its nuclear program while talks 
go on.

  [Text] Washington, June 18 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
reiterated today that it will resume talks with the Democratic 
Peoples' Republic of Korea (DPRK) if the DPRK is ready to freeze 
its nuclear program. 
  The U.S. Administration will discuss the DPRK's position 
with 
U.S. former President Jimmy Carter who just ended his private 
visit to the DPRK today, White House Press Secretary Dee Dee 
Myers said in a statement. 
  It was reported that the DPRK told Carter it will agree to 
allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors 
to stay in the DPRK and to replace its present nuclear program 
with a new light water reactor technology. 
  President Bill Clinton said Thursday [16 Jun] if this 
development means that the DPRK "is genuinely and verifiably 
prepared to freeze its nuclear program while talks go on", then 
the U.S. will be willing to resume high-level talks with the 
DPRK. 
  Myers said that preliminary reports on Carter's visit 
"present the possibility that the North Koreans may be prepared 
to make commitments and take actions" that would pave the way 
for a new round of talks. 
  The U.S. would also seek confirmation through "diplomatic 
channels" on the DPRK's position, she added. 
  "If this meaning of the message is clearly confirmed through 
those channels, and we hope it will be, we would be prepared to 
enter a third round of talks to resolve the outstanding issues 
between North Korea and the international community," Myers said. 
  But she also said that "we are continuing to consult on a 
sanctions resolution at the U.N. Security Council."

<F P=106> ["France Accused of Aggravating Situation on Korean </F>
Peninsula"] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 19 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Saturday [18 June] accused 
France of aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula by 
supporting sanctions against the DPRK, the local newspaper 
NODONG SINMUN reported today. 
  It was reported that the French Foreign Ministry recently 
favored a decisive measure against the DPRK and manifested its 
official stand to support a UN resolution on sanctions. 
  "Such moves of France are aimed at preventing the 'nuclear 
issue' which has become an international focal point from being 
solved through DPRK-U.S. talks... goading Northeast Asian 
countries onto a conflict and thereby fishing in troubled 
waters," the paper quoted a spokesman of the DPRK Foreign 
Ministry as saying. 
  "The situation in our country now has become extremely 
tense," he said, adding that "our people are making full 
prepartions to defend the dignity and sovereignty of the 
country." 
  "We have already declared more than once that in case any 
'sanctions' should be imposed on us, not only the parties taking 
the van in enforcing them but also those who back them would be 
held responsible," the spokesman noted. 
  "The French authorities must know that our warning is not an 
empty word," he warned. 
  The spokesman pointed out that as a permanent member of the 
UN Security Council, France "should help toward a peaceful 
solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through 
dialogue and negotiation."

<F P=106> ["Political Talk" column by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 3768): </F>
"The World Faces a Crisis of Nuclear Proliferation"] 
  [Text] The United States, the ROK, and Japan are kicking 
up an uproar over the DPRK nuclear issue. From the 
international inspections to the sanctions proposal submitted to 
the UN Security Council, the state of events is developing 
through twists and turns and is attracting people's close 
attention. 
  However, in the world as a whole, especially after the end 
of 
the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, nuclear 
proliferation has become an inevitable trend. This has become a 
hidden peril facing world peace. 
  Some countries have already secretly developed their own 
nuclear weapons. Reportedly, Israel and India possess or will 
soon possess nuclear weapons; Iraq, Iran, and Libya are also 
likely to become possessors of nuclear weapons. There are also 
signs that Pakistan is developing nuclear bombs. In order to 
deal with the Indian "threat," it is no wonder that Pakistan 
might develop nuclear weapons. In October 1990, the then Bush 
administration of the United States accused Pakistan of 
developing nuclear weapons and froze economic and military 
assistance to Pakistan. After Clinton took office, the new 
administration prohibited the sale of 38 F-16 fighters to 
Pakistan on the same grounds. Recently, foreign news agencies 
have said that Pakistan has imported sophisticated machinery 
from two German companies to refine enriched uranium. 
  On 13 June, a spokesman for the Pakistani Foreign Ministry 
said: "Pakistan is exploring the possibility of importing 
certain sophisticated machinery from countries which can produce 
such equipment." These remarks actually exposed something the 
spokesman tried to cover up or deny. 
  A more complicated and potential crisis of nuclear 
proliferation not only exists in reality, but is also spreading. 
  After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the 15 republics 
of the former Soviet Union took their own course independently. 
This has made it uncertain whether the gigantic nuclear 
arsenal, missile force, and nuclear submarine fleet of the 
former Soviet Union is still under effective control. 
  On 16 June, Riyabev, first vice minister of nuclear industry 
in the Russian Government, announced that in the last 18 months, 
ten cases of the theft of nuclear fuel had occurred in Russia. 
In one case, the stolen fuel was highly enriched uranium-235, 
which can cause nuclear fission, and in nine other cases, 
uranium-238 was stolen. Uranium-238 is less likely to cause 
nuclear fission if it lies idle. 
  The stolen highly enriched uranium-235 was in the possession 
of a scientific research and production center in Bodolisk in 
Moscow Oblast. An employee of the center stole a total of about 
1.5 kg of uranium-235 on several occasions. The criminal was 
arrested in April this year and the stolen nuclear materials 
retrieved. The authorities are investigating the criminal's 
background. 
  In addition, the Russian federal counter-espionage 
department 
arrested three thieves last March in St. Petersburg. The 
criminals sold 3 kg of uranium-235 to some Germans for $300 per 
gram. The uranium was stolen from a nuclear plant in the Moscow 
suburbs. Two of the three criminals were salesmen from a meat 
shop and one was a plumber. They transported the enriched 
uranium in a container. 
  After the above-mentioned cases were publicized, Western 
countries were stunned by Russia's failure to effectively manage 
its nuclear materials. In particular, an underground market for 
secret transactions in nuclear materials stolen and smuggled 
from Russia has arisen in some West European countries. Some 
Middle East oil- producing countries and Islamic countries have 
a strong interest in buying such materials. If Russia still 
cannot effectively check the illegal outflow of nuclear fuel, 
sooner or later more countries will be able to produce atomic 
bombs. Moreover, there has been a brain among nuclear 
scientists in Russia and Ukraine. 
  The United Nations will be plagued by a complicated 
situation 
of nuclear proliferation and will find that it can do very 
little to bring this under control.

  [Text] Vienna, June 17 (XINHUA) - More than 80 countries, 
including China, approved a nuclear safety convention at a 
foreign affairs meeting of nuclear safety here today. 
  The convention, initialed after a three-day conference, is 
aimed at a high-level nuclear safety in the world through 
international cooperation and enhancing measures in individual 
countries. 
  Under the convention, all signatory countries should take 
proper measures including laws and supervisions to implement it. 
  The convention will be open for signature at the annual 
general conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) in September and come into force once it has been 
ratified by at least 22 countries, 17 of which must have 
operating commercial nuclear plants. 
  The meeting, organized by the IAEA, opened on Tuesday and 
was 
attended by four international organizations and 84 countries.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by staff reporter Zheng Yuanyuan (6774 0954 </F>
0954): "United States Wants Western Europe To Take On Greater 
Responsibilities"] 
  [Text] Paris, 9 Jun (RENMIN RIBAO)--Clinton visited Italy, 
Britain, and France between 2 and 8 June. He attended 
commemoration activities for the 50th anniversary of the Allied 
landings in Normandy and also exchanged opinions with the 
leaders of the three countries in order to improve the 
partnership with the European allies. 
  On 7 June, Clinton gave a speech to the French National 
Assembly, and this attracted extensive attention from the mass 
media. The speech mainly expressed the following three points: 
First, post-Cold War Europe is facing some serious challenges, 
mainly from ethnic and religious contradictions and the 
consequent conflicts and civil wars inside the former Soviet 
Union and the East European countries. Second, the United 
States "supports a strong Europe," and, at the same time, will 
not rescind its military commitment to Europe. Third, a strong 
Europe should be built with all the countries of East and West 
Europe tied by security, economic, and democratic bonds. 
  Clinton expressed support for a powerful Europe, but this in 
fact indicates that the United States hopes Western Europe will 
take on greater responsibilities for resolving the many 
difficult problems of post-Cold War Europe. Therefore, Clinton 
gave up, to a certain degree, his predecessors' attitude of 
having reservations about European integration, especially in 
the aspect of European defense. This is a major change. After 
the end of the Cold War, the United States became the sole 
superpower in the world, but its strength is declining and it 
lacks the ability to continue to act as the "world's policeman" 
to extinguish the flames of war in various hot spots. The 
Clinton administration has thus adopted a policy of no direct 
interference in local conflicts that do not directly endanger 
the "fundamental interests" of the United States. In such 
circumstances, the United States has decided to let Europe 
shoulder greater security responsibilities. That is, Europe 
will be encouraged to expand and strengthen its own 
organizations and institutions in order to restrain and 
eliminate local conflicts. 
  Supporting a powerful Europe is something the United States 
can do at present to reduce its responsibilities without running 
any risks. This is because a lot of uncertainties remain in the 
outlook for the East European countries and about their 
participation in the European Union. A European defense system 
remains in an "embryonic" state, and it will take time for it to 
develop. Therefore, a so-called "strong Europe" will not 
challenge the leading position of the United States in the 
alliance for the time being, and the United States could also 
strengthen itself while Europe undergoes the prolonged 
adjustment process from turbulence to stability. On the other 
hand, this will be a giant challenge for Western Europe, as it 
will have to make greater efforts to solve issues which concern 
the destiny of Europe. 
  To encourage Europe take on greater responsibilities, a 
major 
step taken by the United States was to improve relations with 
France. France is a very influential member of the European 
Union. Clinton chose to give the speech in France because he 
wanted to make a good impression on France and thus ease the 
tense relationship between the two countries in the past few 
years caused by the GATT negotiations and the Bosnia crisis. At 
present, France is trying hard to add a "social chapter" to the 
world trade talks in order to restrict imports from developing 
countries and to protect French products. Therefore, it needs 
U.S. support. Clinton and Balladur reached a consensus in their 
talks and agreed that the two countries should set up an expert 
team to work out a draft for discussion at the G-7 summit in 
Naples. Clinton also showed flexibility on handling the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. He needs France's understanding and 
tolerance toward the U.S. policy of "not sending ground troops." 
So Clinton praised France's "great contribution" to the 
settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis and consented to a 
"European peace plan." 
  Reaction to Clinton's European trip and his speech to the 
French National Assembly varied in the three West European 
countries. Clinton's praise of the European Union, especially 
Franco-German cooperation, delighted Mitterrand, the founder of 
the European Union, but left Britain feeling deflated because 
the "Anglo-American special relationship" was played down. 
Public opinion in Italy, however, held that Clinton's visit 
showed mistrust of the new government. 
  Finally, it should be pointed out that during his trip to 
Europe, Clinton did not forget to call for strengthening the 
internal unity of the Atlantic alliance. He tried to use the 
Normandy commemoration activities to review the historical 
experience of "being comrades-in-arms fighting a bloody battle 
against common enemies" 50 years ago in order to strengthen 
NATO's internal cooperation with the United States as the core. 
However, the cohesive force between the two sides of the 
Atlantic Ocean is getting weaker, and Clinton's call did not 
gain an explicit response. In his talks with Clinton, 
Mitterrand said that France would be a faithful partner, but 
also an "unruly partner." He also explicitly indicated that 
France would not return to NATO's integrated military structure. 
  Clinton's trip to the three West European countries shows 
that Europe remains the focus of U.S. global strategy, but it 
also indicates that European-U.S. relations will encounter more 
difficult problems in the course of readjustments while Western 
Europe takes up greater security responsibilities.

  [Text] Paris, June 17 (XINHUA) -- China today called for 
regular high-level meetings supported by the developed nations 
to coordinate efforts against AIDS in the developing world and 
other hard-hit regions. 
  The call was made by Chinese Health Minister Chen Minzhang 
at 
a ministerial level international conference in Paris, which is 
being held ahead of a Paris summit proposed by France for 
December 1 on the fight against the killer disease. 
  China supports international and trans-regional cooperation 
in the fight against AIDS, said Chen, stressing that more 
attention and efforts should be given to anti-AIDS plans in 
developing countries. 
  It urges neighboring states to coordinate their efforts to 
fight AIDS by setting up information networks and developing 
regional cooperation projects, he added. 
  Chen also briefed the conference on the Chinese Government's 
anti-AIDS work and pledged to make contribution to the global 
strategy against AIDS. 
  The two-day conference, which started today, is being 
attended by ministers from 50 nations and representatives of 
some world health agencies.

"Kim Il-song Says DPRK Will Not Provoke a War"] 
  [Text] Words From the Heart to Sihanouk 
  According to the latest issue of the FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC 
REVIEW published in Hong Kong yesterday (16 June), DPRK 
President Kim Il- song indicated to the United States, through 
Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk: The DPRK has no 
intention of provoking a war. 
  The Cambodian head of state quoted Kim's remark when 
interviewed by the journal's Beijing-based correspondent. It 
happened that when holding talks with Sihanouk on 1 June, Kim 
said: The DPRK has no intention of provoking a war, but if it 
is attacked, it will put up strong resistance. He also asked 
the Cambodian head of state to pass this message to the United 
States. 
  Sihanouk stressed to the journal's correspondent: "Judging 
from President Il-song's words, I don't detect any hostility 
toward the United States." Although Sihanouk said he had not 
passed the message to the United States, he actually had done so 
by speaking to a FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW correspondent. 
  We should believe the veracity of Kim's words,as quoted by 
Sihanouk. First, as a Cambodian head of state openly 
interviewed by the correspondent of a foreign journal, it is 
impossible for him to make out something out of nothing. 
Second, judging by the current situation on the Korean 
peninsula, the DPRK has taken a tough stand because it feels 
humiliated by the attitudes and tones of the United States and 
the IAEA on the DPRK nuclear issue. Owing to national sentiment 
and because it considers the other party unreasonable, the DPRK 
has reacted strongly. 
<H5>  DPRK Resents Acts of Nuclear Inspection </H5>
  When talking about the IAEA forcibly entering the DPRK's 
nuclear facilities to carry out inspections, Kim reportedly told 
Sihanouk: "This is a humiliating body search." "They want us to 
take off our coat, and then our underwear, and now our trousers 
and after that we will be nude, absolutely naked." 
  Through these resentful words Kim has expressed the DPRK's 
feeling of humiliation. This makes it necessary for both the 
United States and the DPRK to listen to China's stand. China 
calls on both parties to remain calm and restrained, and make 
every effort to resume dialogue as early as possible so as to 
avoid further deterioration in the situation. At least people 
should not resort to "Cold War" brinkmanship [zhan zheng bian 
yuan de leng zhan 2069 3630 6708 4878 4104 0397 2069]. 
  Jimmy Carter's talks in Pyongyang yesterday reportedly went 
well. The DPRK promised not to expel the two IAEA personnel from 
its territories. This is what is called "restraint." If the 
DPRK forcibly expels the IAEA personnel, it certainly will be 
denounced by the United Nations and the international community. 
Once the relations deteriorate and the war of words starts 
again, the situation will become serious. 
<H5>  The United States Does Not Want To Start a War Either </H5>
  Judging from the reality in the DPRK today, it is credible 
that Kim Il-song does not want war. On the U.S. side, Clinton 
frequently has muddled things up diplomatically since taking 
office, and for this reason he has been subjected to repeated 
attacks: The deployment of U.S. troops to and their withdrawal 
from Somalia, as well as its threats to send troops against the 
Haitian military government, have been opposed, and it 
shilly-shallies toward the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
its efforts to lift arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims are 
opposed by Russia. Its diplomatic difficulties have piled high 
as a mountain. 
  All these incidents show that Clinton often has been unable 
to make up his mind on major diplomatic issues. In the face of 
the current crisis in Korea, so far Clinton still can be 
regarded as being restrained. As some people within the U.S. 
Government also are skeptical about whether sanctions will work, 
and as China and Russia are against economic sanctions, it is 
hard for the United States to come out with a sanctions package. 
The hesitation on U.S. part shows that the United States is not 
ready and also cannot rashly take military action. 
  The talks Carter currently is holding in Pyongyang provide 
an 
opportunity for both parties to turn hostility into a resumption 
of talks. Since both parties are unwilling and unable to go to 
war, they -- with the participation of the countries concerned 
-- should give the matter further thought and discuss it later, 
in line with the principle of resolving disputes through peace 
talks so as to ease the crisis.

  [Text] Beijing, June 18 (CNS)--There have since 1990 been 
some 100 cases under anti-dumping investigation overseas 
involving China's exports, according to an official with the 
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. He added 
that such accusation had adverse impacts on China's export trade 
worth billions of U.S. dollars. Last year saw 37 such cases, 
registering the greatest ever number in a single year. There 
were 12 cases under the anti-dumping accusation during the first 
quarter of this year which should arouse great concern because 
such accusation from abroad targeting China's export trade have 
tended to grow serious. 
  The United States, Canada, the European Community and 
Australia were the very countries in the past to file protest 
with China for its alleged dumping overseas. Other countries 
including Japan, South Korea, Denmark [as received], South 
Africa, Chile Brazil, Mexico and Nigeria followed suit since 
1992. 
  The anti-dumping practice was just against a particular kind 
of export item in the past but such practice turns to most of 
China's export items at present. Some South America countries 
such as Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela accused 
China of committing alleged dumping of a certain kind of export 
item in great quantity nearly in each of their anti-dumping 
movements [sentence as received]. 
  Key export items including machinery products and textiles 
showed an increasing portion in the items which were alleged to 
be involved in the dumping practice. Colour televisions, 
microwave ovens, electric fans and bicycles were put under 
anti-dumping investigation by the U.S., South Africa and the 
European Community last year while preparations on anti-dumping 
campaign were made by Japan, South American countries and the 
European Community to target China's other export items such as 
textiles, clothing and sport shoes. 
  Three type foreign-funded enterprises run in China tended to 
be under attack for their alleged dumping practice overseas. 
Nearly each anti-dumping campaign carried out abroad in recent 
years involved products turned out by these enterprises. Bad 
influence will be cast on the use of foreign capital by China in 
a long run [sentence as received]. 
  Accusation of dumping made by foreign countries on many 
occasions mainly lied in some reasons [sentence as received]. 
First, a long term economic slump in Western countries, the 
rising trade protectionism and being jealous of China's vast 
trade surplus in recent years played an important role in such 
accusation. Second, following the reform of the foreign trade 
system in China, the export channels tended to increase but 
administration of and control over export items which carry no 
export quota nor export permit stopped short. Some enterprises' 
practice of lowering prices of their products in order to 
strengthen their competitiveness gave a pretext for such 
accusation.

<F P=106> [by Geoffrey Murray] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, June 18 KYODO -- Japanese car firms that 
want to play a major role in the development of China's motor 
industry will have to demonstrate a strong commitment to the 
components sector in order to gain acceptance. 
  At the same time, it is becoming clear that the hesitancy of 
Japanese manufacturers in establishing a strong presence in 
China until the last few years is working against their 
interests, at least for now, in what is likely to emerge as a 
major market by the turn of the century. 
  The Beijing government has not yet officially unveiled its 
new industrial policy for the automobile industry, which was 
originally supposed to be announced at the end of last year but 
has been repeatedly delayed. 
  But Ye Qing, vice director of the State Planning Commission, 
has just outlined conditions for the entry of foreign car makers 
after a government-imposed freeze on new passenger car 
manufacturing operations expires at the end of next year. 
  According to Ye, "all things being equal, priority will be 
given to foreign partners who have shown good cooperation in the 
spare and components parts fields." 
  According to sources, major Japanese and American 
manufacturers now knocking on the door have been told they will 
not be able to establish assembly plants until 1996 at the very 
earliest. Toyota and Mitsubishi were among the companies 
singled out by officials for this treatment. 
  The policy reflects the concern that the Chinese components 
sector is backward and extremely fragmented. In its present 
condition, the industry is considered totally unsuitable for the 
development of a modern automotive industry, which is what the 
government wants to see in place in the next few years. 
  Thus, foreign car makers that did not show faith in China in 
the early days of the open door policy in the 1980s will now 
have to prove themselves by helping to upgrade this sector. 
  The immediate beneficiaries of the new policy are Volkswagen 
of Germany and Citroen of France. Volkswagen began producing 
Santana passenger cars and engines partly for export in Shanghai 
in 1985. A second assembly line at Changchun in the northeast 
was set up in 1991 to produce Audi and Jetta models. Volkswagen 
had many problems initially, especially in the procurement of 
Chinese-made components to meet local content targets (due to 
reach 90 percent by 1996), but the operation is now highly 
profitable. 
  In May 1992, Shenlong (Magic Dragon) Automobile Co., a joint 
venture between Citroen and China Dongfeng Auto Corp. was set up 
with work divided between factories in two central cities, Wuhan 
and Xianfeng. With financial backing from the French 
Government, the venture began producing the Citroen ZX small car 
from complete knocked-down kits, before beginning development 
with its Chinese partner of a new model. 
  The two European companies have now received their reward. 
Ye Qing confirmed Chinese press reports that Beijing will set 
up three automotive conglomerates based on Changchun, Shanghai 
and Wuhan, although it did not give any further details. 
  The official business weekly reported last month that China 
expected to consolidate its existing 120-plus automotive plants 
into "three or four giants that would enable the car industry to 
make five million cars annually." 
  A senior official of the ministry of machinery industry said 
the first stage would be the creation of six or seven 
conglomerates by the year 2000, each capable of producing 
300,000 cars a year. In the early decades of the next century, 
they would be further reshuffled into three or four giants. The 
companies would be granted preference in financing, taxation and 
the issuing of securities. 
  Applications from foreign manufacturers to assemble cars in 
China would be vetted to see how they fitted into this scheme, 
the official stressed, adding, "it is not impossible that some 
new operations will be allowed as the market develops." 
  Among Japanese manufacturers, smaller firms such as 
Daihatsu, 
Isuzu and Suzuki have modest car assembly operations with 
Chinese partners. But the major firms have for the moment 
adopted the strategy of gaining market experience through the 
less costly channel of pickup trucks, minivans and minibuses. 
Toyota, for example, makes vans with state-owned Jinbei ("Gold 
Cup") automotive in Shenyang, northeast China, while Nissan has 
joined a joint venture in Zhengzhou, central China, making 
pickup trucks. 
  There is strong logic in this, given the fact that these 
vehicles are a prime means of transport in the rural areas where 
three- quarters of the Chinese population live -- and where 
roads and after-sales service are not developed enough for 
sophisticated passenger cars. 
  "Chinese officials always tell us that we must pay a premium 
for being late in the market. They say that Volkswagen took a 
risk and has been rewarded and that we should pay extra for 
starting up now," a Japanese executive said after a high-ranking 
industry delegation visited China to be briefed on the growing 
market late last year. 
  As a result, Japanese companies are encouraging their major 
components suppliers at home to seek out potential joint venture 
partners to ensure the Chinese industry is capable of producing 
world standard high quality parts at the right price. Several 
of Nissan's prime suppliers have already established joint 
ventures in Zhengzhou. 
  In May 1993, a wholly owned subsidiary of China 
International 
Trust and Investment Corp. (CITIC) -- the state-run conglomerate 
that is emerging as a key player in China's economic 
modernization -- was established to develop a parts production 
base to support the entire automobile industry. Among the 
initial objectives of Citic Automobile was enhanced cooperation 
with Zhengzhou Nissan, in which it owns an interest. 
  The American giants General Motors and Ford have also 
stepped 
up their activities to find prospective partners for the 
production of a wide range of components. Ford has established 
several joint ventures even though it does not have any vehicle 
manufacturing presence in China yet (GM confines itself to truck 
assembly at present). 
  As a further incentive, the central government announced 
that

  [Text] Washington, June 17 (XINHUA) -- The Clinton 
administration asked Congress here today for special authority 
to negotiate free trade agreements with Latin American countries. 
  Some of these countries have expressed the hope that they be 
included in an expanded North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA) which links the U.S., Canada and Mexico. 
  With fast-track authority, sought by the administration when 
negotiating NAFTA and the General Agreement of Tariffs and 
Trade, the trade agreement negotiated by the administration 
allows no congressional amendment. 
  Sources said bilateral negotiations between the U.S. and 
Chile on the latter's joining of NAFTA will begin later this 
year. Chile reportedly hoped the agreement can be concluded by 
early 1995.

  [Text] New York, June 16 (CNS) -- The '94 China trade 
exhibition held in New York ended yesterday with export trade 
contracts signed during the exhibition valued at US$55.5 million 
while a number of letters of intent were also signed for trade 
and joint ventured items. 
  The trade function was held shortly after an announcement by

favoured nation trade status to China. There were more 
businessmen than before from the U.S. trade as well as 
industrial and commercial sectors to attend the exhibition. 
  During the function, negotiations on import and export trade 
as well as on joint ventures were held between nearly 10,000 
businessmen from across the United States and close to 100 
foreign trade companies, industrial and trade companies and 
three type foreign-funded enterprises from 17 provinces and 
cities across China. U.S. businessmen were very interested in 
high technology items on display involving aero-space 
technology, shipping, petro-chemical products and postal and 
telecommunications equipment. 
  Initial statistics showed that a total of US$55.5 million 
worth of export trade contracts were signed. Trade contracts of 
intent were valued at US$96.47 million while contracts of intent 
for import from U.S. were put at US$21 million. Agreements of 
intent were initially reached on 14 joint ventured production 
items including engines, optical fibre, sedan, circuit plate for 
computer, satellite communication network and steel. Trade 
contacts clinched during the exhibition covered such items as 
grain and oil, machinery, hardware, construction material, 
products of native livestock, light industry, silk, postal and 
telecommunications equipment and handicraft articles.

  [Text] Beijing, June 18 (XINHUA) -- China and Estonia have 
considered it essential to exchange information and experience 
in the fields of economy, science, technology, culture and law 
through consultations. 
  This was stated in a joint declaration on Estonian President 
Lennart Meri's visit to China issued today. President Meri left 
Shenzhen for home late tonight at the end of his seven-day 
official visit to China. 
  During the visit, Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier 
Li Peng had held separate talks with the Estonian president on 
the current state and the prospects of bilateral relations and 
other issues of common interest. 
  "The mutually-beneficial cooperation between the People's 
Republic of China and the Republic of Estonia is progressing 
smoothly," the declaration says. 
  China and Estonia reaffirm their desire to develop relations 
on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial 
integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each 
other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit and 
peaceful coexistence, the declaration notes. 
  The two parties will promote the activities of the official 
missions accredited to them, in accordance with the provisions 
of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna 
Convention on Consular Relations, the declaration says. 
  The Estonian Government "recognizes that the Government of 
the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government of 
China and Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory. 
It affirms that it will not establish government relations of 
any form with Taiwan," it says. 
  China respects the independence, sovereignty and territorial 
integrity of Estonia. 
  China and Estonia also consider it essential to help 
establish relations between social institutions, commercial 
structures and cultural organizations. 
  "In order to promote the continuous development of bilateral 
relations, officials of the two foreign ministries will hold 
political consultations on bilateral relations as well as on 
regional and international issues of mutual interest." 
  The declaration states that China and Estonia are ready to 
strengthen their cooperation within the United Nations and other 
international organizations in accordance with the UN Charter 
and universally-recognized norms of international law. 
  "The two parties express their opposition to every type of 
international terrorism activity and their readiness to 
cooperate in fighting against international terrorism, organized 
crime and the smuggling of arms, narcotics, artifacts of 
historical value and works of art," it says. 
  The two parties point out that each state has the right to 
choose a social and economic system and path of development as 
appropriate to its interests and heritage. "differences in these 
areas should not be an obstacle to maintaining and developing 
normal relations between states." 
  In conclusion, the declaration stresses that the two parties 
affirm that the declaration is not directed against any third 
state and that it does not affect the rights and obligations of 
the parties deriving from the existing bilateral and 
multilateral treaties they have concluded with other states.

Minister Adolfas Slezevicius said today that the forthcoming 
visit to lithuania by Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen is 
expected to further enhance economic cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  Slezevicius told XINHUA in an exclusive interview that 
Lithuania attaches great importance to developing ties with

  Reviewing the development of the Lithuania-China relations 
in 
recent years, he said Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas's 
successful visit to China last year strongly pushed forward the

and its economy is turning for the better although we still face 
a lot of problems." 
  He stressed that the inflation rate in Lithuania has been

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata said today that Japan has the capability to produce 
nuclear weapons and it has not done so because of its 
international treaty obligations, the Tokyo news service 
reported. 
  "It's certainly the case that Japan has the capability to 
possess nuclear weapons but has not made them," KYODO quoted 
Hata as telling Japanese reporters inside the Diet (parliament) 
building. 
  He said Japan has abstained from doing so in line with its 
obligations as a non-nuclear state under the nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), KYODO said. 
  Hata made the comment in connection with an alleged remark 
made in a House of Councillors Budget Committee meeting earlier 
in the day. 
  The prime minister was quoted by parliamentarians as having 
said he "agrees absolutely" with an interpellator's views that 
Japan should confirm to other nations that it can indeed produce 
nuclear weapons, though it is refraining from doing so for 
political reasons. 
  The interpellator, opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
member 
Hiroshi Oki, cited the NPT and Japan's three non-nuclear 
principles -- not possessing, manufacturing or introducing 
nuclear weapons on its territory. 
  KYODO said Hata denied to the press at first that he made 
the 
alleged remark, though Oki insisted that the prime minister 
"roundly affirmed" Japan's potential for producing nuclear 
weapons. 
  It is believed to be the first time for the Japanese 
Government to publicly acknowledge such potential in the Diet or 
public, the news service said.

<F P=106> ["New Talk" column: "A Turning Point for Renewing U.S.-DPRK </F>
Dialogue"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman 
commented on the Korean nuclear issue, and once again called on 
the parties concerned to remain calm and restrained and to make 
all possible efforts to restore dialogue, consultations, and 
negotiations as soon as possible in order to prevent the further 
aggravation of the situation. 
  Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Foreign Minister Qian 
Qichen talked separately about the Korean nuclear issue when 
meeting foreign visitors last week and hoped that the parties 
concerned would solve the problem through negotiations. 
However, the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], after 
being prompted by some countries, adopted a resolution on 10 
June on halting technical assistance to the DPRK. Three days 
ago, the DPRK announced its decision to withdraw from the IAEA, 
and the situation thus worsened. 
  On the other hand, at the invitation of DPRK Foreign 
Minister 
Kim Yong-nam, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter visited the 
DPRK by crossing the border at the truce village of Panmunjom, 
and this has become the focus of people's attention. Yesterday, 
Carter held talks with Kim Yong-nam. More importantly, Carter 
will talk with DPRK President Kim Il-song, and the meeting will 
probably be held today. 
  Because the Korean nuclear issue has now come to an impasse 
that is making the situation more tense than before, the 
international community hopes that Carter's visit will help 
relax the atmosphere. In his speech at a banquet yesterday, 
Carter said that an optimistic outlook remained in the 
situation, and Kim Yong-nam also expressed hope of solving the 
problem through negotiations. Therefore, after Carter's meeting 
with Kim Il-song, some new developments may emerge and a further 
worsening of the situation can be avoided. The situation may 
thus become conducive to the restoration of consultations 
between the two sides. 
  A delegation from Japan's Socialist Party concluded its 
visit 
to the DPRK and returned home from Pyongyang via Beijing 
yesterday. When meeting the press in Beijing, they said that 
during their visit to the DPRK, they were told that the DPRK and 
the United States might resume talks by the end of this month. 
Whether this was true will be verified by Carter after he 
returns to Seoul or the United States via Panmunjom. 
  President Clinton says that Carter is visiting the DPRK just 
in a private capacity, but when meeting Congressional leaders of 
the two parties yesterday, he said that he hoped that Carter's 
visit might bring about more certainty to the situation. 
However, he still stressed that the United States was pursuing 
a "very prudent and very firm" policy toward the DPRK. 
  According to information from Washington yesterday, Clinton 
has drawn up a draft for a sanctions resolution and passed it to 
the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations for consultations with 
the representatives of other nations. The draft requires an 
arms embargo, a halt to UN assistance, a halt to scientific and 
technological cooperation, and a reduction in diplomatic 
contacts with the DPRK. However, the U.S. mass media also 
reported that there would be a one-month grace period even if 
the draft was passed. 
  Carter will stay in the DPRK for four days and will leave on 
Saturday. He will return to the United States on Sunday or next 
week. It is not clear whether a message will be brought back by 
Carter before the UN Security Council begins to discuss the 
U.S.-proposed sanctions, which may not only encounter opposition 
but could also be vetoed. Therefore, if the sanctions plan is 
shelved or removed before the resumption of U.S.-DPRK talks, 
then this will not only bring about a turning point for the 
situation on the Korean peninsula, but will also be conducive to 
the peace and tranquility of Asia and the world.

<F P=106> ["Evening Talk" column by Yang Chu (5017 2612): "United </F>
States Releases Sanctions Plan"] 
  [Text] The United States has announced a proposal for 
three-phase sanctions against the DPRK, with the first phase of 
the sanctions being an arms embargo, which will ban the sale of 
all weapons and components to the DPRK. 
  The sanctions also include such steps as a halt to economic 
and technical assistance to the DPRK and a halt to the $15 
million in annual aid offered by the UN to the DPRK. Technical 
assistance to be stopped includes that for a program on the 
peaceful utilization of nuclear energy. In addition, diplomatic 
exchanges, as well as cultural, technical, scientific, 
commercial, and educational exchanges, with the DPRK will be 
reduced, and air transportation to the DPRK will also be stopped. 
  The sanctions proposal was submitted to the UN Security 
Council yesterday. The proposed sanctions seem rather mild, 
because Chapter 7 of the UN Charter on the use of force by 
states to execute a UN resolution was not applied in this case. 
  First, if force is not used to ensure the enforcement of the 
UN resolution, then arms can still be shipped freely to the DPRK. 
  Second, as the sanctions bill will be put to the vote in the 
UN Security Council, China, as a permanent member of the 
Security Council, may exercise its veto as it has explicitly 
expressed its opposition to the sanctions. 
  The United States may say that if the proposals are not 
adopted by the Security Council, the United States and its 
allies will continue to unilaterally impose the sanctions 
against DPRK, but the sanctions will become less effective. 
  Third, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter is now visiting 
Pyongyang, the capital of the DPRK, and he advocates that the 
United States and the DPRK should establish full-scale 
diplomatic relations. 
  The U.S. strategy is to combine threats with inducements in 
order to compel the DPRK to submit. The United States seems 
tough on the surface, but, fortunately, its real intention is to 
seek a peaceful solution. The announcement of the sanctions 
proposal appears to aggravate the tension, but the real 
situation is not that tense.

<F P=106> ["Short commentary" by XINHUA reporters Gang Ye (0398 0396) </F>
and Wang Dajun (3769 1129 6511): "Keep the Door to Dialogue 
Open"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 18 Jun (XINHUA) -- At the juncture when 
dialogue between all the parties concerned on the Korea nuclear 
issue has reached a deadlock again, a favorable turn has 
reemerged on the Korean peninsula, over which a dark cloud hangs. 
  Korean leaders once again unequivocally expressed their 
positive desire for a peaceful solution to the confrontation 
caused by the nuclear dispute. On 16 June, when President Kim 
Il-song met with former U.S. President Carter, he pointed out 
that Korea [DPRK] and the United States have had some 
misunderstandings due to a lack of trust. He said that Carter's 
visit marked a new beginning in the relations between the two 
countries. One day earlier, Kim Yong-nam, Korean vice premier 
and foreign minister, said that all outstanding issues, 
including the nuclear issue, between Korea and the United States 
can be solved as long as the latter extricates itself from the 
concept of confrontation with Korea, respects Korea's 
sovereignty, and treats Korea on equal terms. He expressed the 
hope that Carter's visit could become a good turning point for 
Korean-U.S. relations to gradually change from distrust and 
hostility to friendliness and mutual respect. 
  Carter also said in his speech that the nuclear issue had 
led 
to a terrible misunderstanding between the United States and 
Korea; that the time has come for the two countries to establish 
friendship, understanding, and comprehensive relations, 
including trade and personnel exchanges; and that all the other 
issues will make progress as soon as the nuclear issue is 
resolved. He stated that the United States' leader and himself 
all believe that the Korean peninsula will surely achieve 
peaceful reunification. Meanwhile, after U.S. President Clinton 
learned that Korea is permitting the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] inspectors and their inspection and monitoring 
equipment to continue to remain in Korea and that it hopes to 
use light-water reactor technology to replace its existing 
nuclear technology, he said: The United States is willing to 
conditionally resume high-level talks with Korea. 
  Several serious confrontations have occurred between Korea 
and the United States since the United States raised the Korea 
nuclear issue after the end of the Gulf war. Two rounds of 
vice-foreign-ministerial-level talks held between the two 
countries brought hope for a solution to the nuclear issue and 
for the improvement of Korean-U.S. relations. However, for want 
of sufficient trust and understanding on the part of the two 
sides, such a momentum for detente was unable to continue. The 
situation deteriorated. The IAEA announced a halt in aid to 
Korea; Korea announced its withdrawal from the organization; the 
United States planned sanctions against Korea. All these cannot 
but cause people to be worried. Many facts concerning the 
international [situation] show that using sanctions to threaten 
can only make a contradiction escalate, that bringing pressure 
to bear on the other side and confrontation are not helpful for 
solving an issue, and that only dialogue is the effective way to 
settle a dispute. 
  At present, both Korea and the United States have expressed 
their desire to hold a dialogue. This provides another rare 
opportunity for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue. As 
long as [all parties concerned] treasure the opportunity and 
hold a dialogue in earnest, it will not be hard for them to find 
an effective way to solve the problem.

  [Text] Seoul, June 18 (XINHUA) -- South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam accepted today a proposal made by Kim Il-song, 
president of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), 
to hold an inter-Korean summit aimed at tackling the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who arrived here 
Saturday 
[18 June] morning following his four-day private visit to the 
DPRK, conveyed DPRK President Kim Il-song's proposal to South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam. 
  President Kim Yong-sam, upon hearing of Kim Il-song's wish 
to 
meet with him at any time, anywhere and at an early date without 
preconditions, told Carter that he will accept the offer 
"without any hesitation," presidential press secretary Chu 
Ton-sik told reporters. 
  Carter conveyed Kim Il-song's verbal message when briefing 
the south Korean president on the results of his Pyongyang trip. 
  Making a quick response to Kim Il-song's suggestion that 
"the 
earlier the summit came the better it would be," Kim Yong-sam 
said that "I myself think that the South-North Korean summit 
would be better the earlier it came," Chu quoted the South 
Korean president as saying. 
  Observers here believed that barring some unexpected 
developments, the inter-Korean summit is likely to be held in 
the near future, for the first time in the half-century of 
national division on the Korean peninsula. The venue of the 
summit can be either in Seoul, Pyongyang or at a third place. 
  Officials sources said that South Korea and the DPRK are 
expected to begin working-level contacts soon to discuss details 
of the planned summit meeting. 
  Carter's shuttling between Seoul and Pyongyang was a bid to 
break the deadlock over the DPRK's controversial nuclear program.

  [Text] China has vowed to prevent hazardous waste 
materials from being allowed into the country. China Radio's 
Song Danqi recently interviewed the deputy director of the State 
Bureau of Environmental Protection. Wu Jia has the report: 
  The Chinese Government is taking measures to prevent 
hazardous waste materials from being shipped from overseas into 
its territory. Wang Yangzu, deputy director of the State Bureau 
of Environmental Protection, delivered a stern warning in 
Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu Province, last Sunday [12 June]. 
  [Wang speaking in Mandarin fading into English translation] 
He explained: On 25 September 1993, two Chinese corporations 
and a group of companies from the Republic of Korea [ROK] 
shipped 1,288 tons of harmful chemical waste to Nanjing Port 
under the label of fuel oil. The illegal shipment of chemical 
waste from South Korea was uncovered by the Nanjing Port 
authorities and caught the attention of the State Council. 
Through the joint efforts of the departments involved, on 5 
March this year, the waste was returned to the port of 
departure. Wang Yangzu further expressed the Chinese 
Government's stance against importing of waste from abroad. 
  [Wang speaking in Mandarin fading into English translation] 
He said: In recent years the cases of transnational 
transferring of harmful waste and rubbish were on the increase. 
He cited another example where Germany had shipped a large 
number of waste plastic bags to China. He said although a small 
number of items of harmful waste can be used as recycling 
materials, the importing must be under strict control. In 
general, almost all dangerous wastes are prevented from entering 
China's territory. The State Bureau of Environmental Protection 
and the General Administration of Customs are now closely 
cooperating to prevent pollutants from being shipped into China. 
Meanwhile, China is now formulating a law to prevent solid 
waste pollution. Wang Yangzu said China will take some legal 
and economic actions against the violations of the law and 
regulations. He revealed a number of people from domestic 
transportation department have been punished in the case of the 
ROK shipping chemical wastes to Nanjing port. He suggested that 
environmental protection must be based on legislative 
administration. All individuals and companies should take 
responsibility for the sustainable development of the global 
environment.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, June 19 (XINHUA) -- The representative 
office of the Democratic Kampuchea Party (DKP) here is 
postponing its withdrawal from the capital till June 20, as 
their visas for Thailand are unavailable on the weekend. 
  The Interior Ministry of the royal government had asked all 
DKP officials to leave the capital before June 19 for security 
reasons, but notified them of the request as late as 6:30 PM of 
June 17. 
  The DKP representative office agreed to the request on June 
18 morning, but failed to get the visas as the Thai Embassy was 
closed as usual at weekends. The DKP people are expected to 
return to their base area via Thailand. 
  Informed of their trouble, King Norodom Sihanouk instructed 
the Royal Palace Office and the government to arrange the DKP's 
departure well, and the Interior Ministry granted the officials 
a one-day delay. 
  There was no demonstration against the DKP here in the past 
two days as the royal government had claimed to be fearing of. 
  One news source said that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign 
Minister Norodom Sirivudh, secretary-general of the FUNCINPEC 
party, said his party took exception to the government decision 
to expel the DKP office from Phnom Penh.

  [Text] Beijing, June 18 (XINHUA) -- Philippine 
Vice-President Joseph Ejercito Estrada arrived here this 
afternoon on an official visit to China at the invitation of 
Chinese Vice-President Rong Yiren. 
  This is Estrada's first China visit since he became vice- 
president of the Philippines. 
  During the visit which is aimed to expand the existing good 
ties between China and the Philippines, he is expected to meet 
with Chinese leaders and exchange views with Vice-President Rong 
on the growth of bilateral ties and issues of common concern. 
  Among those accompanying the vice-president on the visit are 
Mrs. Estrada and members of parliament, as well as a group of 
the Philippine industrialists and businessmen who are to explore 
ways of furthering bilateral trade and cooperation with their 
Chinese counterparts. 
  Rapid progress has been made in bilateral trade over recent 
years. Last year the volume of trade between the two countries 
amounted to 500 million U.S. dollars, hitting an all time-high 
in the past decade. 
  It is believed that Estrada's visit will give a new impetus

  [Text] Beijing, June 20 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President 
Rong Yiren held talks here this morning with Philippine 
Vice-President Joseph Ejercito Estrada. 
  During the talks Estrada reaffirmed his government's 
"one-China" policy, and Rong expressed his appreciation for this. 
  Estrada said that the Philippine economic and cultural ties 
with Taiwan are confined to the non-governmental level. 
  The Philippine Government adheres to its firm promise made 
in 
a communique signed between the two countries in 1975 and to its 
consistent stand that the Government of the People's Republic of 
China is the only legitimate government of China, and that 
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. 
  During the talks, which lasted for over an hour, Rong and 
Estrada exchanged views on bilateral issues and regional and 
other international issues of common concern. 
  Rong spoke highly of the development of bilateral friendly 
ties over the past few years, adding that China and the 
Philippines are close neighbors, and leaders of the two 
countries have exchanged visits frequently. 
  He noted that gratifying results have been made in bilateral 
exchanges and cooperation in the fields of politics, economy, 
trade, and science and technology as well as culture since the 
two countries established diplomatic relations 19 years ago. 
  He said China places great importance on developing its 
trade 
and economic cooperation with the Philippines, and encourages 
Chinese industrialists and businessmen to conduct varied ways of 
cooperation in the Philippines. 
  Rong said that the cooperation of Philippine industrialists 
and businessmen is also welcomed by China. 
  He said he was convinced that, with joint efforts, Sino- 
Philippine relations will grow in depth. 
  Estrada said he was satisfied with the growth of bilateral 
friendly ties and cooperation, and said he hoped that his visit 
would contribute to furthering such a relationship. 
  He said he wished to increase the volume of bilateral trade 
and welcomed more Chinese entrepreneurs to invest in his country. 
  During the talks Estrada invited Rong to visit the 
Philippines, and Rong accepted the invitation with pleasure. 
  Before the talks Rong presided over a ceremony welcoming 
Vice- President Estrada and Mrs. Estrada and their party. 
  After the talks, the two leaders attended a ceremony to sign 
a trade protocol for this year. 
  In the afternoon, the Philippine vice-president met Tao 
Siju, 
minister of public security. 
  This evening Rong is to give a banquet in honor of Estrada 
and his party.

  [Text] Hangzhou, June 19 (XINHUA) -- The Hangzhou City 
Intermediate People's Court [IPC] convened a sentencing rally in 
Hangzhou this morning to announce the judgment of the Zhejiang 
Provincial Higher People's Court approving the death sentence 
for Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan, and Yu Aijun, the three criminals 
guilty of the heinous crime of robbery and murder in Qiandao 
Lake, Chunan County, on 31 March. Leaders of Hangzhou city and 
representatives from all walks of life and relevant departments 
of the province and city -- 1,200 in all -- were present at the 
sentencing rally. 
  Yang Gang, president of the Hangzhou City IPC, presided over 
the rally. Wang Zhijian, chief judge of the First Criminal 
Division of the Hangzhou City IPC, read the adjudication. After 
reviewing the death sentences, the Zhejiang Provincial Higher 
People's Court decided to approve the sentences -- death and 
deprivation of political rights for life -- for Wu Lihong, Hu 
Zhihan, and Yu Aijun for the crime of robbery and murder. The 
court decided the cumulative punishment of death and deprivation 
of political rights for life be carried out. 
  Wang Yongming, mayor of Hangzhou, spoke at the rally. He 
pointed out that the sentencing rally fully reflects the purpose 
of judicial organs in upholding justice and being loyal to the 
law and people. It fully reflects the party and government's 
firm determination to safeguard public order, to severely punish 
criminals, and to protect the safety of life and property of the 
broad masses of the people as well as compatriots from Hong 
Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and overseas Chinese, and foreign 
nationals within Chinese territory. The severe punishment for 
the three criminals in accordance with law not only defends the 
dignity of law but also serves as the best consolation for the 
deceased compatriots. 
  After the sentencing rally, the three criminals Wu Lihong, 
Hu 
Zhihan, and Yu Aijun were, after verification of their identity, 
escorted to the execution ground and shot in pursuance of an 
order of execution issued by the president of the Zhejiang 
Provincial Higher People's Court.

  [Text] Hangzhou, June 19 (XINHUA) -- Three men guilty of 
robbery and murder in the March 31 Qiandao Lake tragedy in 
Zhejiang Province, east China, were executed here today after 
the provincial higher court approved the death sentence. 
  More than 1,200 people gathered at the Hangzhou theater this 
morning to hear the judgement announced by the Intermediate 
People's Court of Hangzhou. The verdict was read by the 
intermediate people's court, saying that Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan 
and Yu Aijun on March 31 this year robbed and murdered 24 Taiwan 
tourists and eight mainland crew members on a pleasure boat on 
Qingdao Lake, a major tourist attraction in Zhejiang Province. 
  It said that the three men robbed the tourists of large 
quantities of their property by threatening them with violence 
and then murdered the victims by blowing up the boat and setting 
fire to it. 
  The three men accused of robbery and murder were sentenced 
to 
death and deprived of political rights for life on June 12. 
  They did not appeal to a higher court against the sentence 
within the legal period. Chinese law grants a three-day period 
for appeals.

  [Text] Hong Kong, June 20 (AFP) -- China was making plans 
Monday to blow up a strategic levy in Guangdong Province to stop 
the worst floods in 50 years from inundating the prosperous 
Pearl River delta region. Local officials, contacted by 
telephone, said all measures had been taken to destroy the levy 
at Foshan, 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Guangzhou city, if 
flood waters continued to rise. "If the flood waters rise by 
another 30 centimeters (one foot), then we will have to 
sacrifice part of Foshan," one official told AFP. 
  Threatened downriver were Guangzhou, the provincial capital 
which has been on full flood alert since Saturday, and the Pearl 
River delta, which is home to China's largest concentration of 
foreign investment. 
  Hong Kong newspapers called the floods -- triggered by 
successive days of torrential rains which persisted Monday -- 
the worst in 50 years, claiming more than 200 lives in various 
areas by official count. The crisis disrupted what was supposed 
to have been a triumphant inspection tour of the province by 
China's president and communist party leader Jiang Zemin, the 
EASTERN EXPRESS newspaper said. Jiang arrived Sunday in 
Shenzhen, across the border from Hong Kong, only to spend his 
first hours visiting some of the 160 injured in Friday's 
collapse of a fire-gutted textile mill in another city, Zhuhai, 
that left 24 dead. 
  The Guangdong official, who asked not to be named, said the 
demolition of the levy had been approved by the central 
government in Beijing, which has called for all efforts to 
protect China's richest province. Blowing up the levy would put 
a vast area of lush farmland underwater, but reduce the threat 
of floods wreaking greater damage downriver. Flood waters had 
already submerged several counties around Sanshui city, upriver 
from Foshan, where the North and East rivers join to become part 
of the Pearl River delta, which flows into the South China Sea. 
Late Sunday, flood waters in Sanshui had risen to 12.34 meters 
(40 feet) or nine meters (30 feet) above the warning level. In 
nearby Zhaoqing, the North River had jumped its banks, rising 
13.53 meters (44 feet) or 4.53 meters (15 feet) above the 
warning point. 
  Tens of thousands of Foshan residents were evacuated to 
Guangzhou, residents said, while in the provincial capital 
itself 500,000 people -- half of them from the Army -- had been 
mobilized to fight the floods. In Guangzhou, shops and 
factories along the river banks set up walls of sandbags and 
moved equipment to higher ground, residents said. 
  Provincial authorities meanwhile banned increases in 
staple-food prices, with immediate fines for anyone caught 
profiteering from the flood.

  [Text] Hong Kong, June 20 (AFP) -- In Hong Kong, Governor 
Chris Patten said the territory has informed China that it 
stands ready to provide whatever assistance it can to help 
Guangdong confront its flood waters. "The devastating floods in 
China have shocked everybody in Hong Kong," Patten said. He 
also extended "sympathy at the large loss of life which those 
floods have already caused." The majority of Hong Kong's six 
million people trace their family roots to the Pearl River delta.

  [Text] One person is confirmed dead and 60 injured after a 
Hong Kong-owned textile factory collapsed in Zhuhai this 
afternoon. Up to 40 people are still thought trapped beneath the 
rubble of the building, which was being cleaned up after being 
gutted by fire. 
  The factory is owned by a Hong Kong-China joint venture and 
is estimated to have employed around 1,500 workers. What 
remains of it now is mostly rubble. The gutted remains of the 
building were being searched by around 200 workers and firemen, 
making sure the fire was completely extinguished and starting to 
move out cloth and textile materials. At about 1400 it's 
believed that heavy rains started to fall, weakening the 
structure still standing. Shortly afterwards, the remaining 
walls came crashing down, trapping around 100 people. Sixty of 
them are said to have been taken to hospital, suffering 
injuries. A spokeswoman at Zhuhai's People Hospital described 
the situation there as very busy. One person is confirmed dead; 
about 40 others are still thought to be trapped under the rubble. 
  The fire at the factory began at around 1700 yesterday 
afternoon, and spread quickly through the six-story building 
located close to the Macao border. It was put out around four 
hours later at 2100. 
  The question authorities will now be asking is why workers 
and firemen went back into the building if the structure was 
unsafe.

  [Text] At least eight workers ordered by their Hong Kong 
bosses to retrieve cotton from a fire-damaged Zhuhai factory 
were killed when it collapsed yesterday. 
  Shopkeepers next to the Hong Kong joint-venture factory said 
they saw the bodies of eight workers covered in blankets next to 
huge mounds of rubble. Soldiers, Public Security Bureau (PSB) 
officers and hospital workers were searching for an estimated 40 
others early this morning. 
  Another 40 were in hospital, many with broken limbs. 
  The Yue Sun Textile Factory -- a joint venture between a 
Hong 
Kong merchant and the Zhuhai Qianshan Industrial Company is in 
the Qianshan Industrial Zone about eight kilometres north of the 
Macao border. It is one of the largest in Zhuhai. 
  Two weeks ago in nearby Shenzhen 11 people died when a 
partially-built plastics factory collapsed. 
  PSB officers were refusing to comment but sources at the 
scene said the workers were ordered back into the factory 
yesterday by their Hong Kong bosses to salvage cotton damaged in 
the blaze which gutted the factory on Thursday. They said 
workers could be seen throughout all six storeys of the building 
as it crumbled into a three-storey pile of rubble about 2 pm. 
Rescue work was delayed for 30 minutes after debris caught fire 
at 9 pm. Diggers and cranes moved in, allowing a human chain 
formed by survivors to reach one man, screaming as his head 
popped above the rubble. 
  Shopkeeper Chang Kamyick, 18, said: "On the third floor I 
saw 
at least 20 workers. I heard a huge bang like an earthquake and 
I turned and saw the building collapse within two minutes. 
  "Ten workers ran out but others were trapped. One man only 
had his head above the rubble. He yelled for help and a digger 
went in to rescue him. 
  "Many workers joined hands to pull him out. Others stayed to 
look for survivors. Minutes later officials arrived to help." 
  Other sources at the scene said the fire-damaged building, 
which supported heavy machines on its middle floors, appeared to 
be weakened after a four-hour downpour. Maintenance worker, 
Liang Yuyang, 25, who was pulled unconscious from the wreckage 
and rushed to hospital, said that when the building had 
collapsed around him he had thought it was the end. 
  "I had been going round the edge of the site, when suddenly 
I 
felt as if a water fall was gushing around me.I thought I was 
already dead but I woke up in the hospital a few hours later." 
  Mr Liang had been taken to the Xiangzhou Hospital in the 
back 
of a truck before being operated on for multiple injuries 
including a broken leg. He said he had been working for around 
one year and until yesterday had felt that the management was 
good. Earlier in the evening the Mayor of Zhuhai, Liang 
Guangda, visited some of the victims in the Xiangzhou Hospital. 
  Labour groups in Hong Kong reacted strongly, criticising the 
decision to allow the workers to re-enter the factory before 
ensuring it was safe. 
  "It was irresponsible behaviour," said the chief executive 
of 
the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims, 
Chan Kam- hong. 
  A fire had raged through most of the factory building on 
Thursday, but no casualties were reported. Firemen from Zhuhai 
and nearby cities put out the fire at dawn yesterday, and 
workers returned to remove damaged yarn from lower floors. 
Others were working outside the building. At about 2 pm after 
torrential rain and strong winds, the front half of the building 
collapsed. Zhuhai public security authorities sent hundreds of 
officers and firemen to rescue the victims, and sealed off a 
section of the highway to Guangzhou for ambulances and rescue 
vehicles. 
  A spokesman for Zhuhai City People's Hospital said most of 
its patients had minor injuries. Many had been treated and 
discharged. Factory director Yeung Chi-kwong refused to comment 
on why workers were allowed back into the scorched building, 
saying management still had to clarify many questions. He said: 
"We can't answer your questions at the moment, because of 
administrative reasons." 
  Zhuhai residents gathered to see whether relatives were 
among 
the casualties. 
  The factory was one of the largest in Zhuhai and employed 
more than 2,000 workers, most of them from Sichuan and Hunan 
provinces. Portuguese news agency Lusa in Macao said it was a 
300 million yuan (HK$267.6 million [Hong Kong dollars] ) 
investment. 
  Zhuhai Labour Bureau director Guo Boquan said preliminary 
investigations showed the fire had been related to welding.
