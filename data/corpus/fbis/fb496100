<F P=106> [Summary of implementation of the goals of "three, five, </F>
eight, and 10": "Stride Forward Toward the Good Beginning of the 
Magnificent Goal"] 
  [Text] If we say that Tianjin's development pace has 
obviously accelerated since the commencement of reform and 
opening up, then, the changes in the future will be even more 
spectacular. When drawing the outlines of the magnificent 
blueprint for striding forward toward the 21st century, 
Tianjin's people have vividly summarized the blueprint as the 
goals of "three, five, eight, and 10." That is, to quadruple 
the 1980 GNP in 1997, three years ahead of schedule; to 
basically complete the rebuilding of dangerous and shabby houses 
in urban areas in five to seven years; to readjust and renovate 
through grafting all large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises in about eight years; and to basically complete the 
building of the new coastal area in about 10 years. At present, 
the implementation of these four fighting goals are being 
organized in a planned and step-by-step manner. 
<H5>  The Demand of the Situation, and the Expectation of the </H5>
People 
  The raising of these four fighting goals is not the 
subjective assumption of a certain person or some persons, but 
is the objective demand of Tianjin's development and the 
expectation of Tianjin's people. The sixth municipal party 
congress and the first session of the 12th municipal people's 
congress, held last year, defined Tianjin's overall development 
target and set forth the demand of using 20 years' endeavor to 
make Tianjin one of the areas in China that basically realize 
modernization and to build Tianjin into the commercial, trading, 
and banking center of northern China, into a comprehensive 
industrial base that is advanced in technology, and into a 
modernized international big port city opened to all directions. 
To this end, we must turn goals and tasks into specific actions 
based on the analysis of Tianjin's situation and the overall 
situation, must map out plans and arrangements for several 
stages, and then carry out these plans and arrangements step by 
step. The goals of "three, five, eight, and 10" have been 
defined around the fulfillment of the overall target after many 
investigations and appraisals were conducted. These four goals 
are internally connected with one another and affect and 
supplement each other. In the overall plot of the acceleration 
of Tianjin's development, we have given prominence to 
appropriately handling the relations between existing 
enterprises and new enterprises. On the one hand, we have 
stressed the endeavor of invigorating existing enterprises and 
grasping the readjustment and renovation of old enterprises; 
and, on the other hand, we have stressed the necessity of 
cultivating new and major economic growing points. In the 
economic layout, we have stressed the development of new areas 
and the rebuilding of old areas. In the priorities of 
development, we have given prominence to invigorating large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises and developing rural 
economy. In the relations between production and livelihood, we 
have defined the necessity of regarding the improvement of the 
people's living standards as the starting point and the ending 
point of all work on the basis of developing production. 
  Being examined and approved by the municipal people's 
congress last March, these four goals have evoked strong 
repercussions among Tianjin's people, and the vast numbers of 
cadres and the masses have been inspired by these goals. Most 
people maintain that these four goals are not only realistic but 
also press the people to forge ahead; and these four goals are 
not only the demand of the situation but also the expectation 
and the voice of the vast numbers of the masses. Many people 
say that all localities in the country are now vying with one 
another in developing themselves, Tianjin, as a municipality, 
should be even more rapid in the pace of carrying out reform, 
opening up, and economic construction. We have the wish and the 
vigor to let our hometown develop at an even faster pace and 
become even more beautiful. These four goals have let us catch 
sight of hopes and have a bright prospect. In particular, the 
goal of rebuilding all dangerous and shabby houses in five to 
seven years has enjoyed popular support and become the central 
topic talked by the people at streets and lanes. As said by the 
common people, "there is no need to enter the 21st century by 
living in old and shabby houses built in the thirties and 
forties." 
<H5>  Drawing the Concerted Efforts of All Fronts </H5>
  Realizing these four fighting goals is a grand, huge project 
all fronts should make concerted efforts to realize these goals. 
To this end, the municipal government has exerted great 
efforts and strengthened the organizational leadership over the 
realization of these goals. A leading group for realizing these 
four goals has been organized with Mayor Zhang Lichang as its 
head. This leading group has four subteams with responsible 
vice mayors as their heads and relevant commission, bureau, 
district, and county responsible persons as their members. 
Offices subordinate to the subteams have been established to 
take charge of day-to-day investigations, coordination, and 
supervisions. So far, four subteams have convened meetings on 
several occasions, defined overall plans and annual plans for 
implementing these four goals, also divided the tasks among each 
level, set up a system for assessment of targets, and done their 
best to firmly attend to the implementation of these goals. For 
instance, the subteam of the new coastal area emphatically 
studied the plan of the key coastal development area and defined 
the dividing lines of the new coastal area. The new coastal 
area covers five districts (including Tanggu, Hangu, Dagang, and 
parts of Dongli and Jinnan), and 20 townships. It occupies an 
area of 350.36 square kilometers. This area is a new rising 
area whose prospects for economic development are greater than 
any other areas in Tianjin as well as one with the highest 
degree of opening up, the widest coverage of policies, and the 
best infrastructural facilities. The new coastal area will 
develop 188 square kilometers in the next 10 years or by 2003. 
At that time, its gross domestic product and foreign export 
value will account for 40 percent, respectively, of the 
municipality's total. This year, its GNP will increase by over 
20 percent and surpass the growth rate of the municipality. So 
far, the construction of some key projects is in full swing. 
The 140,000-ton ethylene, 200,000-ton polyester, Jinnan-Hangu 
highway, and Dagang-Tanggu highway projects are under full 
construction. The pre-phase preparatory work for the Beitang 
power plant, the project for diverting Luanhe water to Hangu, 
and the third coal gas plant is in full swing and these projects 
are being listed for examinations and approvals. Tianjin Harbor 
is accelerating its construction pace and is to obtain a 
capacity of annually transporting 500,000 standard containers to 
foreign countries and to possess 40 million tons of loading and 
unloading capacity. The development zone should continue to 
keep the leading positions in the whole country in terms of the 
fulfillment of its targets. In the first five months of this 
year, the development zone made new headway in inviting 
businessmen and bringing in capital. A total of 233 
foreign-funded enterprises of three types have been approved. 
The investment in these enterprises totals $747 million. The 
investment scale of the projects averages at $3,056,400. 
  The municipal economic, commercial, and communications 
committees conducted deep and thorough investigations on 
readjustment and transformation of old enterprises with foreign 
capital, worked out specific plans for transforming state-owned 
large and medium-sized enterprises step-by-step, and also 
prefulfilled the tasks for readjustment and transformation with 
foreign capital in the next five years. Of the municipality's 
748 state-owned large and medium- sized enterprises, 214 should 
fulfill the tasks for readjustment and transformation with 
foreign capital this year and 143 should fill the tasks next 
year. That is, 48 percent of the large and medium-sized 
enterprises should be transformed in 1994 and 1995. The 
municipal economic committee urged that through grafting 
readjustment and transformation, 318 large and medium-sized 
enterprises should realize the quadrupling tasks three years 
ahead of schedule. In 1997, the total industrial output value 
should reach 74.59 billion yuan and the profits and taxes 
realized by the industrial enterprises should reach 10.27 
billion yuan, respectively, increasing by more than 600 percent 
and 400 percent over 1980. The grafting readjustment and 
transformation of the commercial department's 80 large and 
medium-sized enterprises are under smooth progress. Ten joint 
ventures have made preliminary achievements in grafting 
transformation, 11 enterprises have made progress in 
readjustment and transformation, and the reconstruction and 
expansion of nine large-sized retail sales shopping centers are 
under full swing. 
<H5>  Implement These Goals Step by Step To Achieve Initial Results </H5>
  The key to realizing the four goals is to do a good job in 
taking the first step and to have a high starting point. If we 
do a good job in the first year, we may enhance the spirit, 
boost morale, and lay a foundation for future development. To 
realize the goal of quadrupling the GNP three years ahead of 
schedule, from 1993 to 1997, we must increase the municipality's 
GNP at an annual progressive rate of over 11 percent, and this 
year we plan to increase the GNP by 12 percent. This requires 
our efforts to conscientiously grasp well all quarterly and 
monthly economic tasks. Judging from the operational situation 
of this year's first quarter, the development rate and 
efficiency were fairly good. The whole municipality's GNP 
reached 15.415 billion yuan, up 12.4 percent over the same 
period last year, thus attaining the required progress. Of 
this, 296 million yuan came from the primary industry, up 4.4 
percent; 9.72 billion yuan came from the secondary industry, up 
12.1 percent; and 5.399 billion yuan came from the tertiary 
industry, up 13.5 percent. From January to May, the total 
output value of industrial units at and above the township level 
across the municipality reached 37.669 billion yuan, up 16.6 
percent over the same period last year. 
  The project of renovating slum houses that draws the 
attention of the people across the municipality has been 
smoothly carried out. The municipal leading comrades have 
traveled to the construction sites to give work guidance and 
help solve problems on many occasions. Six districts in the 
municipality have taken quick actions, grasped this work firmly, 
done solid work, actively collected construction funds, expanded 
the strength to invite business and introduce capital, and 
unceasingly accelerated the progress of renovating slum houses. 
From January to May, the municipality as a whole demolished a 
large area of slum houses totalling 520,000 square meters, built 
houses covering an area of 4.29 million square meters, completed 
the construction of 438,000 square meters of houses, and enabled 
10,019 residents to move into new houses. 
  On the basis of sizing up the real situation, industrial 
enterprises have accelerated the pace in grafting, readjustment, 
and transformation of old enterprises. They signed 66 contracts 
on utilization of foreign capital from January to April. The 
total volume of contracted investments reached $448 million, 
and the volume of contracted foreign capital reached $251 
million. Of this, 53 items were on grafting and transformation 
of old enterprises with foreign capital, the total volume of 
contracted investments reached $396 million, and the volume of 
contracted foreign capital reached $214 million. 
  A good development trend has emerged in the construction of 
a 
new seaside area. At present, the whole line of the Tianjin 
Port-Tanggu highway has been initiated. Most of the earthwork of 
the Tianjin section of the Shanhaiguan-Guangzhou highway has 
been completed. The Xinhua Road overpass in Tanggu is expected 
to open to traffic by the end of June. Construction of a heat 
and power plant and a water plant in the development zone is in 
full swing. The Nanjiang bridge project at the port area is 
progressing smoothly. The intangible conditions for building the 
polluted water disposal center are being strengthened, and the 
pre-phase preparatory work for building the energy wharf has 
been comprehensively carried out. 
  We will sow what we reap. This year's opening situation is 
quite good and the trend is excellent. We are convinced that as 
long as the higher and the lower levels across the municipality 
work with one heart and one mind, unite as one, and make 
indomitable and unremitting efforts, we will surely attain the 
"3.5.8.10" fighting goal on time or ahead of schedule, and 
Tianjin will surely have a more brilliant future.

  [Text] According to the latest statistical data released by 
the municipal statistical bureau, Tianjin's industrial economy 
has shown a sustained, stable, and healthy development since the 
beginning of this year, and Tianjin achieved another new level 
in major industrial targets in May. 
  The industrial production kept a trend of steady progress. 
In 
May, the total output value created by the industries at and 
above the township level in the municipality was 8.511 billion 
yuan, an increase of 17.1 percent over the same period of the 
previous year, and the industrial output value from January to 
May totaled 37.669 billion yuan, an increase of 16.6 percent. 
The sales of products was improving month by month. In May, 
the sales value of Tianjin's industries at or above the township 
level was 7.754 billion yuan, an increase of 16.2 percent over 
the same period last year. The sales value from January to May 
totaled 34.867 billion yuan, increasing by 14.2 percent; and the 
marketing rate of products was 92.25 percent in May, 1.43 
percentage points up from April. 
  The development of light industry continued to be faster 
than 
that of heavy industry. In May, Tianjin's output value of light 
industry totaled 3.681 billion yuan, an increase of 18.7 percent 
over the corresponding period of last year, the output value of 
heavy industry totaled 4.83 billion yuan, increasing by 15.9 
percent. The proportion of light industry increased to some 
extent. From January to May, the ratio of the light industrial 
output value to heavy industrial output value was 44.55:55.45. 
Comparing with the ratio of 36.1:63.9 in the same period of the 
previous year, the proportion of light industrial output value 
rose by 8.46 percentage points. 
  The developing trend of nonstate-owned industry was strong. 
From January to May, the industrial output value of the "three 
types of foreign-funded enterprises" increased by 1.12 times 
over the same period last year, the net increase of the output 
value was 4.014 billion yuan, accounting for 74.9 percent of 
Tianjin's net increase of output value. The output value of 
township-run industry increased by 38.48 percent over the same 
period last year, and the net increase of the output value was 
1.97 billion yuan, accounting for 36.8 percent of Tianjin's net 
increase of output value. The output value of the industries 
run by districts, counties, and neighborhoods increased by 35.9 
percent over the same period last year, and the net increase of 
the output value was 382 million yuan, accounting for 7.1 
percent of Tianjin's increase of output value. 
  The development of the production of export products 
achieved 
the best level in recent years. The value of the export 
products of industrial enterprises totaled 4.232 billion yuan, 
an increase of 46.84 percent over the same period in recent 
years, achieving the best level in the same period in recent 
years. This gave larger impetus to Tianjin's efforts to earn 
more foreign exchange through exports and development of 
export-oriented economy. 
  The major indexes of the industrial economic efficiency were 
better than the corresponding period last year, achieving the 
best level in May. According to statistics, the profit and tax 
of the industrial enterprises at and above the township level 
that implemented the independent accounting system totaled 773 
million yuan in April, 37.5 percent up from the average level of 
this year's first quarter. Of the total, profit was 280 million 
yuan, 166.7 percent up from the average level of this year's 
first quarter. Tianjin's sales income from January to April 
totaled 27.21 billion yuan, an increase of 12.5 percent over the 
corresponding period last year, and its profit and tax totaled 
2.459 billion yuan, up 16.8 percent. 
  Judging from the developing trend, Tianjin is capable of 
attaining a half of the annual objective by the end of this 
year's first half.

  [Text] Xining, June 20 (XINHUA) -- Qinghai, one of China's 
poor provinces in the northwest, has declared that the province 
will get rid of poverty by the end of 2000. 
  Located on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, Qinghai has harsh 
natural conditions and is often hit by natural disasters. 
  According to Ma Yuanbiao, vice-governor of the province, by 
the year 2000 Qinghai's animal husbandry production will occupy 
30 percent of total agricultural production, the per capita 
income of farmers and herdsmen will be over 500 yuan, and some 
50 percent of the total social production value in rural areas 
will be made by township enterprises. 
  In the past eight years, the poverty-stricken areas in 
Qinghai have constructed over 2,300 kilometers of highways and 
improved farmland soil and grassland. The per capita income has 
increased by 81 percent in the rural areas. 
  The provincial government has helped the poor areas to set 
up 
nearly 1,000 processing factories for farm and animal husbandry 
products, mining and metallurgical plants and trained more than 
1 million people. 
  In 1993, the total industrial output value in poor areas was 
1.25 billion yuan (about 180 million U.S. dollars), 2.6 times 
the figure eight years ago. 
  As a result of these efforts, nearly 70,000 people in the 
province have escaped poverty every year. But there are still 
1.19 million people under the poverty line, one-third of the 
population in rural areas. 
  According to a new help-the-poor plan of the province, there 
will be an average of 170,000 people escaping poverty each year, 
and 14 percent increase of per capita income, through 2000. 
  The provincial government has issued policies to encourage 
enterprises in developed areas to invest in poor areas. 
  Each year, the province issues 3 million yuan in 
aid-the-poor 
loans.

  [Text] The provincial party committee recently decided to 
entrust the provincial discipline inspection commission with the 
task of forming and deploying to some 10 prefectures and cities, 
as well as some 30 key provincial departments and bureaus, a 
total of 12 inspection groups comprising nearly 100 cadres from 
the provincial people's congress, Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference committee, as well as the leading group 
in charge of building party style and clean government. 
  The 12 inspection groups will mainly inspect the province's 
anticorruption work since the start of this year. The 
provincial party committee has decided that the 12 inspection 
groups should try to focus on the following developments: 1) 
Whether or not the party and government cadres at county or 
provincial department section level have met all five 
self-examination and self-rectification requirements; 2) Whether 
or not all exposed corruption cases have been thoroughly 
investigated and handled; 3) Whether or not various malpractices 
have been straightened out; and 4) Whether or not the 
province-wide anticorruption struggle has attained the desired 
results. 
  The provincial party committee stressed: The upcoming 
province-wide anticorruption check-up is an important measure in 
deepening and prolonging the province's on-going anticorruption 
struggle, summing up the province's achievements and progress in 
the anticorruption struggle since 1993, popularizing the 
province's successful anticorruption experiences, investigating 
and tackling each and every existing problem in this connection, 
strictly implementing this year's three anticorruption tasks, 
and striving for more tangible achievements in the 
anticorruption struggle before the end of this year.

  [Text] Xian, June 18 (XINHUA) -- Shaanxi Province in 
northwest China has scored marked achievements in environmental 
protection and pollution control. 
  The province has made great efforts to reduce the discharge 
of industrial pollutants such as waste gas and water. 
  Last year the treatment and utilization of waste gas 
increased by 28 percent, of waste water by 4.7 percent and of 
solid waste by 0.54 percent, according to Zhang Lianjie, head of 
the provincial Environmental Protection Bureau. 
  The provincial government spent over 100 million yuan (about 
12 million U.S. dollars) between 1991 and 1992 to complete 503 
pollution-control projects. 
  In 1993 the province built 52 smoke and dust control zones, 
covering an area of 236.9 sq km, and 21 noise pollution control 
zones, covering 108 sq km. 
  The provincial government also relies on universities and 
scientific research institutes to help reduce pollution in the 
cement, textile, metallurgical, power, mineral and chemical 
industries. 
  Meanwhile, the province has built 13 nature reserves with a 
total area of over 164,000 ha, and ecological agricultural 
demonstration zones in nearly 100 villages. 
  Some 79 rare animals and plants such as crested ibis, golden 
monkey and davidia involucrata baill are now well protected in 
the province.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuan Yang (6678 3152): "Commenting on Taiwan </F>
Leader's Visit to Four Countries"] 
  [Text] Between early and mid May, the Taiwan authorities' 
top leader made a visit to four countries in Central America and 
Africa. What image has Taiwan conjured up in the international 
community? What impact will it exert on cross-strait relations? 
People might size up the situation and make a judgment on it by 
linking it to the Taiwan authorities' past behavior. 
  The deepest impression the four-country trip left us is 
precisely that this Taiwan leader "tossing silver dollars along 
his way" -- was giving dollar-alms to some economically 
underdeveloped impoverished and small countries to buy their 
popular support for Taiwan's "return to the United Nations." 
  Last year, the Taiwan authorities' attempt to "return to the 
United Nations" met with the opposition and resistance of the 
international community and went bankrupt, but they would not 
let the matter drop. Since the beginning of this year, the 
Taiwan authorities have stepped up their activities, with some 
prominent figures made frequent trips to visit some foreign 
countries to demonstrate Taiwan's status as a "sovereign state." 
During the spring festival this year, the Taiwan authorities' 
leader went to some Southeast Asian countries on "holiday 
calls"; an important purpose of which was precisely to rely on 
its "strength in economy and trade" "to expand its international 
living space," in an attempt to become a dialogue partner with 
ASEAN countries so as to obtain its status of a political body 
and thus squeeze itself into this regional international 
organization, thereby laying a foundation for its future "return 
to the United Nations.". To achieve this purpose, the Taiwan 
authorities have provided several Southeast Asian countries with 
$150 million low-interest loans in the form of aid. 
  During his four-country visit this year, he was playing the 
same old trick, and continued to buy popular support with huge 
sums of money. In Nicaragua, he forgave its $17 million loan, 
in addition to providing it with a $30 million low-interest loan 
in exchange for Nicaragua's support for Taiwan's "return to the 
United Nations." In Costa Rica, he provided the country with a 
$15 million low-interest loan in exchange for the country's 
guarantee to support Taiwan's "return to the United Nations." 
In South Africa, he provided the country with $15 million to 
consolidate "diplomatic relations" between the two sides. In 
Swaziland, he also provided the country with a considerable loan. 
  To accomplish certain political aims, the Taiwan authorities 
also provided funds for the candidates in some countries' 
general elections, which can be likened to placing bets on those 
who had greater probabilities to win, aside from giving alms in 
public. Such improper practices already have aroused reproaches 
and repugnance from political circles and the masses in some 
countries. The Taiwan people have long expressed their 
resentment of the authorities' squandering money. They 
indicated that "dollar diplomacy" was like taking a stimulant 
that had only a brief effect, but would not effect permanent 
cure." A major Taiwan newspaper expressed doubt as to what role 
such countries' accepting aid could play in Taiwan's "return to 
the United Nations." The paper said, compared with over 100 UN 
members, the strength of the friendly Central and South American 
countries was limited, even insignificant. 
  The important task in the four-country visit by the Taiwan 
leader was to consolidate "diplomatic relations" with South 
Africa through the swearing-in ceremonies for newly elected 
South African President Mandela. For this reason, aside from 
providing the loan, he expected the new South African 
administration would develop its relations with Taiwan and PRC 
according to the "dual recognition" pattern. In coordination 
with this, some Taiwan officials, media, and hired scholars once 
again raised a hubbub concerning the theory of "dual 
recognition." Some high-ranking responsible persons openly 
asserted that Taiwan was ready to accept "dual recognition," 
regardless of the one-China principle. 
  In fact, reviewing the various tricks to which the Taiwan 
authorities have resorted since the 1960's in their fight for 
"international living space," it is not difficult to see that 
the "dual recognition" attempt has never succeeded, but some 
decision-makers among the Taiwan authorities have failed to 
realize their errors and mend their ways, while increasingly 
distancing themselves from the "one-China" principle. 
  In the 1960's, France, the Congo, and Dahomey established 
diplomatic relations with PRC; at that time, Taiwan's embassies 
tried to stay in those countries and would not leave. At last, 
they had to lower the flag, remove the embassies, and leave 
those countries. 
  In late 1980's, the Taiwan authorities set out the principle 
of "pragmatic diplomacy," and changed from "swearing not to 
coexist with the enemy" to "staying put when the enemy comes." 
Regarding "dual recognition at that time, the Taiwan 
authorities adopted the practice of doing it, but not saying it 
aloud. 
  In the early 1990's, the Taiwan authorities dished up the 
"Program for National Reunification," announcing that "under the 
prerequisite of one China, Taiwan and Mainland China should show 
respect for one another without rejecting each other in 
international affairs." When this program was presented, it 
came under fire from Mainland China and form figures who showed 
concern for the reunification of the motherland, while 
indicating that in the program the adherence to one China was 
false, the truth was to deepen the split between Taiwan and the 
motherland. 
  Under such circumstances, the Taiwan authorities dare not 
announce openly that their pursuit in promoting "dual 
recognition" is the goal of their "diplomatic policy"; in 
practice, however, they have never given up the opportunity and 
attempt to promote it. 
  Recently, a responsible person of Taiwan's "Executive Yuan" 
stated: By "dual recognition" we mean a sort of parallel 
relation, not one of opposition. Therefore, he had to admit 
that Mainland China would by no means agree to such a concept. 
It follows that Taiwan is to face lots of difficulties in 
"diplomatic work." 
  Obviously, the resolute opposition to "dual recognition" on 
the part of Mainland China is based on the fundamental interests 
of the entire Chinese nation, and on firmly safeguarding the 
"one China" principle. As adherence to the "one China" 
principle is an important tie to maintain the fresh-and-blood 
relations of the compatriots in Taiwan and China Mainland, any 
speech or action deviating from or shaking this important 
principle will seriously affect the healthy development of 
interactive cross-strait relations. 
  An increasingly growing number of facts demonstrated that in 
handling foreign relations or relations with the mainland, some 
decision-makers among the Taiwan authorities are dangerously 
moving further from the path of the "one China" principle. 
Recently, a person in office representing the Taiwan 
authorities said that the concept of "China" is vague. It would 
not be strange if this statement had been made by some Taiwan 
Democratic Progress Party member, but it was made by none other 
than a person in office representing the Taiwan authorities, and 
that has given us much food for thought. How can he adhere to 
the "one China" principle? What position has he placed himself 
in before the righteous cause of the Chinese nation and history?

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by reporter Jin Songtai (6855 2646 0669): "In </F>
First Five Months This Year, Shanghai Attracts the Highest Level 
of Taiwan Investment on the Mainland"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 14 June (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- The 
"Investment Inspection Council of the Economic Ministry" of 
Taiwan has made an announcement on the situation of Taiwan 
businessmen's investment in the mainland between January and May 
1994. Statistics show that Shanghai remained the area where 
Taiwan businessmen made the largest total amount of investment 
on the mainland. Of the 475 mainland investment projects, 66 
were in Shanghai, where the investment amount totaled $68.54 
million, far greater than that in Shenzhen, which ranked second 
place. 
  Although Shanghai lacks natural and geographic partners for 
close economic relations -- like those that exist between 
Guangdong and Hong Kong, between Fujian and Taiwan, and between 
Shandong and South Korea -- Shanghai is still the favorite of 
Taiwan investors. In particular, some companies which have 
achieved initial successes in Shanghai are making additional 
investments, which form a substantial force. 
  The chain store business, which began in 1992, is now the 
key 
point of competition among overseas corporations. Chung Hsing 
Group and Pacific Construction, companies that run chain 
department stores in Taiwan, have launched investment projects 
in Shanghai. In view of the good business prospects in 
Shanghai, Pacific Construction will launch a second-phase 
$7.2-million investment project in Shanghai's Pacific Department 
Store, which will increase its total stake in the department 
store to $12.7 million. Ouyang Yi-ming, the company's general 
manager, said that the rapid business growth in Shanghai 
prompted them to make the decision on the construction of the 
second building for the Shanghai Pacific Department Store. 
  Last month, the board of directors of the Hua-hsin Li-hua 
Company, the Taiwan cable and wire producing enterprise that 
made the highest amount of indirect investment in the mainland, 
held a meeting to adopt three indirect mainland investment 
schemes. Its original plan for building a power and cable plant 
in Jiangsu's Wuxi was shifted to Shanghai, with the amount of 
investment increasing form $3.5 million to $6.75 million. 
Before that, Hua-hsin Li-hua had already invested and run 
factories in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Wuhan. 
  Shanghai became the Taiwan businessmen's favorite investment 
target thanks to Shanghai's vital relations with the Chang 
Jiang. After Shanghai was built into a port city in 1843, it 
continued to be a major foreign trade port for the entire Chang 
Jiang valley. Taiwan's Chang Jung Shipping decided to make 
investment in Shanghai precisely because it took this fact into 
account. On 14 May, the shipping company signed an official 
contract with the Shanghai Harbor Authority on building a 
container terminal with an area of 60,000 square meters along 
Baoshan's Jungong Road. The project will be completed and put 
into operation in approximately one year and will be named the 
Shanghai Chang Jung Container Corporation. The Shanghai side 
exchanged the land for shares of the company and the Chang 
Jung's holding in the company will not be limited. In addition, 
Chang Jung will have full management power. 
  A number of Taiwan-funded enterprises engaged in 
labor-intensive industries such as plastics, footwear, garments, 
and mechanical tools have been set up in the nine suburban 
districts and counties. They and the urban Taiwan investment 
projects, primarily engaged in tertiary industry, support and 
supplement one another. In the first quarter of this year, 
Taiwan-funded enterprises in Shanghai's suburban areas numbered 
846 and accounted for 51.8 percent of the total number of 
Taiwan-funded enterprises in Shanghai. Of the suburban 
Taiwan-funded enterprises, 70 percent were labor-intensive ones. 
  Experts expect that Shanghai will become the base for the 
mainland headquarters of many Taiwan companies in the near 
future. After Citibank decided to move its China headquarters 
from Hong Kong to Shanghai and Morgan Stanley decided to move 
its Asia headquarters from Hong Kong to Shanghai, other foreign 
corporations may take similar action and this will give a 
warning to Taiwan businessmen: Do not let this opportunity slip 
by. Wei Chuan Group built a food producing center in Shanghai 
as its operation center in the mainland; Xiamen Kun Tsan, which 
was the first foreign-owned company to be listed in the mainland 
stock market, moved its mainland headquarters to Shanghai and 
also proceeded from Shanghai to sell its products in all parts 
of the country, thus becoming the model for Taiwan companies 
seeking to enter the mainland market. 
  Yang Wen-fan, general manager of the China market 
headquarters of Kun Tsan, said that Shanghai plays two functions 
which cannot be replaced by other cities. It is the city that 
absorbs information and provides opportunities more directly and 
rapidly. The city is also the sole "economic window" which can 
radiate to all parts of the mainland market. As long as 
products can sell well in Shanghai and gain fame, they will 
certainly become popular in nearby provinces and cities. 
  Since Shanghai became the key point of the mainland's reform 
and opening and once again became the economic, financial, and 
trade center of the Chinese mainland, it has certainly had great 
influence among Taiwan businessmen. In fact, Taiwan businessmen 
have had a strong interest in Shanghai for a long time, and this 
shows that they are well-aware of Shanghai's position. As 
Taiwan's CHING CHI JIH PAO said, in order to occupy the mainland 
market, one must first gain a foothold in Shanghai.

Up of Parliamentary Organizations of ASEAN Countries Concludes 
Friendly Visits to Inner Mongolia"] 
  [Text] The delegation made up of the parliamentary 
organizations of the various countries of the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN] successfully concluded its 
two-day friendly visit to Inner Mongolia and left Hohhot by 
plane on the morning of 11 June, bringing with it the 
achievements in further strengthening the friendly relations and 
economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation between the 
various ASEAN countries and Inner Mongolia. 
  The 25-member delegation headed by Jose de Venecia, speaker 
of the Congress of the Philippines, came to visit China at the 
invitation of the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing 
Committee. It arrived in Hohhot on the evening of 8 June, 
greeted by regional leaders and people of various nationalities. 
  Accompanied by Zhu Liang, member of the NPC Standing 
Committee and chairman of the NPC Foreign Affairs Committee, and 
Yu Xinglong, vice chairman of the NPC Nationalities Committee 
and vice chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regional 
People's Congress Standing Committee, the delegation went to the 
pastoral areas of Siziwang Banner by car on the morning of 9 
June. It was warmly received by local party and government 
leaders and the masses of various nationalities. In the 
Gegentala grassland, the delegation watched with great interest 
contests of the Mongolian nationality's traditional sports, such 
as wrestling, archery, and horse race, and happily visited 
herdsmen households. That evening, herdsmen held a campfire 
with nationality and local characteristics to welcome the guests 
from afar. The hosts and guests sang and danced together to 
spend a happy and unforgettable evening in the grassland. 
  Chaired by Yu Xinglong, vice chairman of the autonomous 
regional people's congress standing committee, a briefing was 
held at the Baotou Hall of the auditorium of the autonomous 
regional government on the afternoon of 10 June for Lin Yongsan, 
vice chairman of the autonomous regional government, to 
introduce Inner Mongolia's economic and social development to 
the delegation. 
  At 1800 that day, Wang Qun, Wu Liji, Qian Fenyong, Yu 
Xinglong, Lin Yongsan, and Xu Bainian warmly met with the 
delegation at the Jirem League Hall of the auditorium of the 
autonomous regional government and held cordial talks with it. 
Zhu Liang, member of the NPC Standing Committee and chairman of 
the NPC Foreign Affairs Committee, was present at the meeting. 
  Wang Qun introduced the delegation the economic and social 
development of China and, in particular, Inner Mongolia. He 
said: With a vast territory and abundant resources, Inner 
Mongolia has great potential for exploitation and very bright 
prospects. We welcome the various ASEAN countries to invest in 
Inner Mongolia's enterprises and other developmental 
undertakings and to further strengthen the friendly relations 
and economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation with the 
region. 
  Jose de Venecia, leader of the delegation, first thanked the 
regional party and government leaders and the masses for their 
warm and friendly reception. He said: Our delegation is from 
five countries of southeast Asia, representing 250 million 
southeast Asian people. After returning to our countries, we 
will tell our countries and peoples that Inner Mongolia 
Autonomous Region is speeding up construction and development in 
all fields. We will also sincerely conduct cooperation and 
exchanges with Inner Mongolia in economic, cultural, and other 
fields. 
  That evening, Wang Qun, Wu Liji, Qian Fenyong, Yu Xinglong, 
Lin Yongsan, Yang Zizhen, and Xu Bainian hosted a banquet in 
honor of the delegation at Xincheng Hotel. Wang Qun and Jose de 
Venecia gave speeches, pledging concerted efforts to strengthen 
the cooperation between Inner Mongolia and the various ASEAN 
countries. 
  Yu Xinglong, Lin Yongsan, and Yang Zizhen warmly sent the 
delegation off at the airport on the morning of 11 June.

  [Text] Beijing, June 21 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice President 
Rong Yiren today urged British and American business people to 
take advantage of China's reform and opening-up and lose no time 
to strengthen economic and technical cooperation with Chinese 
enterprises. 
  The vice-president made the call when meeting with C.R. 
Sitter, president of Exxon Corporation and Lord Prior, chairman 
of General Electric Company here this morning. 
  From the long run, the Chinese vice-president said during 
his 
meeting with Lord Prior, the series of fundamental reform 
measures introduced in taxation, banking and foreign trade at 
the beginning of this year, which were designed to promote a 
socialist market economic structure best suited to Chinese 
conditions, will make it more convenient and more favorable for 
foreign investors to invest and conduct economic and technical 
cooperation in China. 
  Despite the fact that China was not familiar with market 
economy, Rong said, China has adopted all possible measures in 
the course of deepening reform and opening-up and these have 
laid a solid foundation for Sino-foreign cooperation in all 
domains. 
  The vice-president said that the strengthening of 
cooperation 
between developed and developing countries will facilitate 
economic recovery and growth of developed countries. 
  In a certain sense, he noted, it is the best way of 
promoting 
the development of the world economy by strengthening 
"South-North cooperation. [no closing quote as received] 
  Rong told Mr. C.R. Sitter that China has always attached 
much 
importance to the development of energy industry. Although 
tremendous progress has been made over the past decade in 
China's energy industry, he added, it is still unable to keep 
pace with the development of the entire national economy. 
  He said that China hopes that all internationally known 
corporations such as Exxon would take further steps to 
strengthen cooperation with China in energy and petro-chemicals, 
including the utilization of funds and advanced technologies of 
these corporations. 
  He told Mr. Sitter that all the reform measures introduced 
in 
China have yielded significant results as shown in the increase 
of state revenue, stable foreign exchanges rates, and rising 
foreign exchange reserves. 
  It is rather normal that some problems may occur in the 
course of reform, the Chinese vice-president said. What is most 
important is discover and solve them by taking practicable 
measures. 
  Lord Prior and Mr. Sitter came to China at the invitation of 
the China International Trust and Investment Corporation and the 
China National Petrochemical Corporation. Their corporations 
are ready to conduct a new round of cooperation with Chinese 
departments in the development of the power industry and the 
exploration and development of land and offshore oil.

  [Text] Hong Kong, June 22 (AFP)--Sino-British talks on 
Hong Kong were making headway Wednesday, negotiators said, as a 
top Chinese official suggested Beijing was prepared to accept a 
financing plan for the colony's new airport. 
  "We've covered a lot of ground. The atmosphere continues to 
be constructive," chief British negotiator Hugh Davies said 
after the second day of Sino-British Joint Liaison Group talks. 
  He declined to give details, but Davies and Chinese 
counterpart Guo Fengmin promised to say "something more" when 
their meeting winds up on Thursday. 
  On Friday the Joint Liaison Group's specialized airport 
committee is to discuss the vexed issue of how much debt to 
raise to pay for the 20.3 billion U.S. dollar Chek Lap Kok 
airport and related public works. 
  The Joint Liaison Group is the diplomatic body charged with 
hammering out technical details of Hong Kong's 1997 handback to 
China. This week's meeting is its first in six months. 
  In an interview with the Asian Wall Street Journal, 
Beijing's 
top official for Hong Kong affairs, Lu Ping, said China was 
"very flexible" on the financing issue. 
  "Britain has been indicating that it wants to cooperate with 
the Chinese side on the economic front," Lu was quoted as 
saying. "We are waiting to see their deeds." 
  The airport financing issue has been overshadowed since 1992 
by Governor Chris Patten's pre-1997 democratic reform plans, the 
final stage of which is to be adopted next week by the 
Legislative Council. 
  Picking up on Foreign Minister Qian Qichen's statement last 
week that China was willing to bury the hatchet when it comes to 
Patten's political reforms, Lu said: "Chris Patten is someone 
beyond our control." 
  Under a 1991 agreement with Britain, China must be consulted 
if Hong Kong wants to raise more than five billion Hong Kong 
dollars (646.83 million U.S.) of airport-related debt maturing 
after 1997. 
  But Lu said Beijing now was ready to accept a debt level 
"far 
about five [as received]." He did not elaborate. 
  Hong Kong favors tapping world capital markets to help pay 
for Chek Lap Kok, taking advantage of the best interest rates in 
many years, but China dreads that too much debt will be left 
behind once Britain departs in 1997.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Jing Shuzhan (2529 2118 1455) and reporter </F>
Jia Yong (6328 3057)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 18 Jun (XINHUA) -- The second class of Army 
cadres of command level and above to study Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, sponsored by the 
National Defense University under the Central Military 
Commission [CMC] and the General Political Department, ended 
today. So far, a total of 154 senior Army cadres have attended 
the classes. 
  To assemble senior cadres from the whole Army to study 
Volume 
3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and discuss 
current major issues in the country and the army's modernization 
drive was an important measure adopted by the CMC in order to 
further implement the strategic task of arming the whole army 
with the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. Jiang Zemin, Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, and 
other CMC leaders attended discussions on two occasions with 
members of the first and second study classes. 
  According to a briefing, members of the study classes 
diligently studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics in the light of the 
realities in the work of each unit or department. They 
discussed in particular the theme of Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on socialist market economy, the building of spiritual 
civilization under the condition of market economy, and the 
Army's ideological and political work. Through study, members 
deepened their understanding of Deng Xiaoping's scientific 
exposition on the essence of socialism, grasped a deeper insight 
of the intrinsic meaning of socialism, and enhanced their 
consciousness and steadfastness in implementing the party's 
basic line. Meanwhile, they obtained a better understanding of 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on socialist market economy -- especially 
the theory's formulation, contents, and great significance -- 
thereby raising their awareness of safeguarding the overall 
interests and of subordinating themselves to the overall 
interests. They also further clarified their ideas for work and 
improved their leadership quality. It is understood that, 
inspired by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory, members of the study 
class wrote more than 100 theses with keen insight.

  [Text] Harbin, June 22 (XINHUA) -- China has launched a new 
move to auction off more wasteland to farmers in an effort to 
quicken the building of water and soil conservation projects and 
help farmers achieve greater economic gains. 
  To date, the use right of a total of 500,000 hectares of 
wasteland in north China's Shanxi, Shaanxi and Heilongjiang 
Provinces had been sold to farmers, according to a national 
wastelands auction held in Mudanjiang city of northeast China's 
Heilongjiang Province. 
  China has more than 300 million hectares of wasteland 
suffering from serious water loss and soil erosion, over ten 
percent of which (about 30 million hectares) can be developed. 
  State Councillor Chen Junsheng sent a message, hailing the 
opening ceremony of the auction, saying the new move is an 
extension of China's household contract responsibility system, 
with remuneration linked to output, that started in rural areas 
in the late 1970s. 
  It is a new step, under the new market economic conditions, 
to initiate a mass movement to tackle soil erosion, he said. 
  According to the state councillor, the right of development 
and use of wastelands sold legally allows farmers to explore and 
use the land for a period of 50 to 100 years. It can be 
inherited and transferred, he said. 
  The move helps to bring into full play the initiative of 
local peasants to control water loss and soil erosion and tap 
natural resources and further develop agricultural production, 
Chen said. 
  He added, it also opens a new way for the surplus labor 
force 
in the rural areas to find jobs and helps raise necessary funds 
for the country's water conservation projects. 
  Due to various historical reasons, he said, soil erosion in 
China is still serious. It is of great significance to tackle 
the problem by mobilizing the masses of people, he said. 
  He urged governments at all levels to understand and carry 
out the policy in spirit and to the letter and in the light of 
the real situation in each locality. 
  According to the meeting, the main bidders for the use right 
of large tracts of wasteland are farmers, but personnel from 
governmental bodies, workers and staff members from state-owned 
and private enterprises, as well as overseas business people, 
are also encouraged to participate. 
  Wasteland that suffer from serious soil erosion, including 
barren mountains, valleys, hills, rivers and streams, will be 
given priority in the sales. 
  Money raised will be used solely as a special fund in 
tackling soil erosion problems in other areas. 
  More than one hundred representatives from the governmental 
water and soil conservation departments at all levels across the 
country are taking part in the meeting.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 (XINHUA) -- Japan today denied that 
it is capable of producing nuclear weapons, saying the nation 
"does not have any expertise or experience in producing nuclear 
weapons." 
  "Japan has highly advanced technology for the peaceful use 
of 
nuclear energy," however, mere possession of high-level nuclear 
technology and scientific technology does not amount to 
production ability, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Terusuke Terada 
told a regular press conference. 
  Terada's denial of Japan's nuclear potential came days after 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata acknowledged that Japan has the 
capability to produce nuclear arms but said it has not done so 
in line with its international treaty obligations. 
  "It's certainly the case that Japan has the capability to 
possess nuclear weapons but has not made them," Hata told 
Japanese reporters inside the Diet building last Friday. 
  Terada said Japan's nuclear power activities are restricted 
to peaceful purpose by the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the 
atomic energy basic law and others. 
  As the only country that suffered from atomic bombing, Japan 
strictly upholds a so-called three no's principle -- no 
possession, no manufacturing and no introduction of nuclear 
weapons, he said.

<F P=106> [Commentary by ANHUI RIBAO contributing commentator: "Study </F>
the New Fiscal and Taxation Systems and Seize the Initiative in 
Providing Leadership"] 
  [Text] In our reform of the economic structure this year, 
we will combine package reform with breakthroughs in key areas, 
with reform of the fiscal and taxation systems constituting a 
key content. Successfully carrying out fiscal and taxation 
system reform is of great significance to accelerating the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure; further 
straightening out interest relationships among various sectors; 
enhancing the enthusiasm of people at various levels; 
simultaneously increasing revenue and stimulating economic 
development; and to upgrading Anhui's economic level and overall 
strength. To ensure the smooth progress of reform, many areas 
have conscientiously studied and publicized the new fiscal and 
taxation systems. Although they have achieved some results in 
this respect, we should be aware that work done thus far is 
entirely insufficient. Quite a number of comrades, including 
many leading comrades and those directly engaged in economic 
work, have failed to attach sufficient importance to knowledge 
of fiscal and taxation system reform. Instead of carefully and 
thoroughly studying the new fiscal and taxation systems, they 
only understand them in general terms, and are not clear about 
how to handle problems encountered in the course of implementing 
the new systems. Therefore, they have not taken the initiative 
to adapt themselves to the new situation and to switch to a new 
idea for economic development. This state of affairs is 
entirely incompatible with the new situation. 
  Anhui is now at the critical phase of accelerating 
development. Whether or not we can seize the opportunity, 
advance by taking advantage of the situation, and keep the 
development momentum, depends heavily on our ability to pass the 
test of fiscal and taxation system reform. To Anhui, the 
introduction of the new fiscal and taxation systems is both a 
challenge and an opportunity, and is both pressure and a motive 
force. Through implementing the new fiscal and taxation 
systems, we should redirect the guiding thought for economic 
work at different levels to optimizing structures and improving 
efficiency, in order to create new conditions and a new motive 
force for Anhui's economic development. Meanwhile, as the 
factors of increased spending have risen this year, we should 
handle the relationship among reform, development, and stability 
well. This also requires that we concentrate on doing our 
fiscal and taxation work well. Therefore, cadres at all levels, 
particularly leading cadres, must enhance their understanding of 
the importance of thoroughly studying the new fiscal and 
taxation systems. They should know that this is an important 
matter which has a bearing on Anhui's economic development as a 
whole, and therefore, they should do it well. Efforts should be 
made, through a thorough study of the new fiscal and taxation 
systems, to enhance Anhui people's awareness of opportunities 
and competition. We should make serious efforts to tackle 
reform of the fiscal and taxation systems, accelerate economic 
development, increase revenue and reduce expenditure, and ensure 
that there will be a surplus in the balance between revenue and 
expenditure this year; thereby laying the foundation for 
economic development and an increase in tax revenues in the 
future. 
  In strengthening the study of fiscal and taxation system 
reform, it is necessary to conduct investigations in all 
localities. Leading cadres at all levels and comrades from 
various relevant departments should visit various localities, 
trades, and enterprises to specifically study and analyze the 
situation to obtain first-hand information. By combining 
qualitative and quantitative analysis, they should get a good 
picture of the local situation. 
  On the basis of 
investigation and study, leading cadres and comrades of various 
departments should actively work to meet the requirements of the 
new fiscal and taxation systems, further straighten out their 
development plans, and readjust the economic structure. In 
particular, they should have a clear understanding of the 
following points: First, they should stick to the concept of 
development; keep in mind the importance of increasing tax 
revenues and boosting economic development; vigorously cultivate 
new trades for expanding the economy; promote the coordinated 
development of first, secondary, and tertiary industries; open 
up new avenues of financial resources; and make economic 
development the reliable basis for expanding tax revenues. 
Second, it is necessary to enhance awareness of efficiency, 
firmly establish the standard -- "economic development is based 
on efficiency, the improvement of efficiency is based on profits 
and taxes, and the increase in profits and taxes can be 
determined from the amount of profits and taxes delivered to the 
state"; accelerate readjustment of the economic structure; 
invest limited funds and resources in industries and products 
which comply with state industrial policies, give quick returns, 
and have high added value; and pay attention to efficiency in 
economic development. Third, it is necessary to change the 
concept of supporting enterprises by relying purely on reducing 
taxes and transferring profits; improve the relationship between 
the government and enterprises; and ensure that all taxes are 
collected; at the same time, after localities have strengthened 
their financial power, they should concentrate on supporting 
enterprises. Fourth, it is necessary to give equal importance 
to broadening sources of income and reducing expenditure, and 
resolutely put a stop to extravagance and wastefulness. 
  Fiscal and taxation system reform is a specialized job and 
involves a wide range of subjects. It will be difficult to 
carry out if we do not work hard. All localities and 
departments should, on the basis of preliminary studies, make 
further efforts to conduct a comprehensive and systematic study 
to tackle existing problems and to increase their understanding 
of the reform. In particular, they should thoroughly study the 
new situation and contradictions which have emerged in the 
practice of the new systems. They should avoid being satisfied 
with a general and conceptual understanding, and overcome the 
tendency to simplify matters because they are difficult to 
understand. Leading cadres should take the lead in engaging in 
studies; personally conduct investigations and studies; and 
seize the initiative in leading economic work. Fiscal and 
taxation system reform involves various sectors and the vital 
interests of the masses. When new policies and regulations are 
promulgated, the relevant departments should see to it that they 
are quickly implemented in grass-roots areas and enterprises. 
They should promptly discover and sum up the work experiences 
of various localities, and vigorously popularize them to promote 
the smooth advance of fiscal and taxation system reform.

  [Text] Guangzhou, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Ou Guangyuan, deputy 
governor of south China's Guangdong Province, said here today 
that Guangdong is to promote the development of real estate 
market and the construction of development zones. 
  Speaking at a ceremony entitled "China (Guangdong) First 
Program Week To Promote Real Estate and Development Zones," the 
deputy governor said that Guangdong will continue its efforts to 
improve its investment environment and to deepen the reform of 
the land use system so as to bring the role of land assets into 
full play in economic development. 
  Yuan Zheng, director of the Guangdong Land Resources 
Department, said that the program week is aimed at academic 
exchanges, theoretic research, business project talks and real 
estate transactions. 
  In 1993, the land on which Guangdong transferred land-use 
rights amounted to 15,000 hectares and brought an income of 1.1 
billion yuan. 
  Foreign funds that Guangdong has gotten from its land market 
accounted for 42 percent of the total last year. 
  The program week is jointly sponsored by China Land Asset 
Promotion Society, Guangdong Land Society and Guangzhou Real 
Estate Association. 
  During the program, a symposium on the reform of land-use 
system will also be held with the participation of the delegates 
of 18 provinces and regions.

  [Text] Haikou, 11 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- In Haikou 
a few days ago, Governor Ruan Chongwu, secretary of the Hainan 
Provincial CPC Committee, officially presented a license for the 
use of state-owned land in the Yangpu Economic Development Zone 
to Mr. Yue Yuen-ping, chairman of the board of the Hainan Yangpu 
Land Development Company Limited. 
  According to the relevant provisions of the license, the 
user 
of the land, covering 27.353 square km in Yangpu Economic 
Development Zone, is the Hainan Yangpu Land Development Company 
Limited; the tenure is 70 years (from 26 December 1992 to 26 
December 2062); and the whole area is to be developed through 
construction projects. Moreover, in the remarks column of the 
license, the limits and scope of land use right, the method of 
transferring land use right, and the method of handling changes 
in conduct also are explicitly stipulated. The license holder 
owns the largest development land area and has the most special 
development pattern in China. 
  To accelerate the development of Yangpu, in an official, 
written reply issued the other day, the Hainan Provincial 
Government explicitly called on the Yangpu Land Development 
Company to earnestly fulfill the provisions laid down in the 
"Contract of Transfer." In line with the requirements of 
overall planning, the latter should ensure that within 15 years 
after the acquisition of land use right, it will invest a total 
of 18 billion Hong Kong dollars in the construction of public 
facilities, and in particular, should invest 10 billion Hong 
Kong dollars in the first five years. Meanwhile, in accordance 
with the "Contract of Transfer" and the many previous 
commitments of Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong) Limited, it should 
speedily sign special contracts or agreements with the 
departments concerned on the resettlement of residents and on 
the construction of water, electricity, and other government 
public facilities in Yangpu Economic Development Zone. 
  Mr. Yue was very pleased to receive the license. He said: 
The issuance of the state land use right license has provided a 
just and rational legal basis and force to land holding in 
Yangpu Economic Development Zone, and has made it convenient for 
the license holder to invite investment. He said the company 
will boost the development of Yangpu in the near future by 
paying effective attention to such issues as removal, 
resettlement, water, electricity, communications, and invitation 
of investment.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Relying on Deepening Reforms To Solve Problems </F>
Arising in Reforms -- On Relations Between Deepening Reforms and 
Handling Contradictions Among the People"] 
  [Text] Reform means self-improvement and self-development 
of our socialist system. In accordance with the requirements of 
the development of productive forces, it naturally will adjust 
the patterns and relationships of interests among various 
quarters. Therefore, it inevitably will bring about many 
contradictions. Today, in particular, when our reform has been 
in full swing and has entered the stage of effecting a major 
breakthrough, new reform measures have touched, or will touch 
upon the depths of relations of social interests quite 
extensively. This inevitably will cause more and more 
complicated contradictions. Compared with the past, the present 
contradictions among the people are more conspicuous, 
widespread, and complicated. We should say that this is a 
normal phenomenon that demonstrates a new economic system full 
of vigor and vitality. It is advancing more rapidly to replace 
the old economic system, which trammeled the development of 
productive forces. 
  Therefore, in the fact of many complicated contradictions, 
we 
must neither feel puzzled nor shrink back. We must realize that 
the old system not only trammeled the development of productive 
forces and adversely affected the improvement of the people's 
living standards, but also distorted interest relationships in 
many aspects. This fostered discontent among the broad masses 
of people. Under the old system, contradictions among the people 
not only existed extensively, but also faced the possibility of 
being intensified at all times. Therefore, at a glance, with 
the deepening of reform, there are more and more acute 
contradictions among the people. Actually, our production 
relations and superstructure have become more suitable to the 
development of productive forces. Distorted interest 
relationships among various quarters and collectives are being 
straightened out. Unity between the state and the people, 
between the central and local authorities, between various 
departments, between various units, and among the masses is 
being strengthened. Facts have shown that reform is beneficial 
to the stability of our country, social progress, and unity of 
the people. Therefore, no matter how enormous the contradictions 
we encounter, we must be firm and unshakable in deepening 
reform, and must rely on deepening reform to solve problems 
arising in reform. This is our basic idea for handling 
contradictions among the people. 
  Why should we rely on deepening reform to handle 
contradictions among the people? This is because complicated 
contradictions among the people which have been brought about by 
deepening reform are contradictions based on identical interests 
of the masses, and contradictions arising in social progress. 
However, if we fail to handle them in a timely fashion, there 
might be negative results. Those nonantagonistic contradictions 
might even become antagonistic contradictions. Leading organs 
and cadres at all levels must attach importance to this matter, 
and must work conscientiously and seriously to handle it well. 
  First, we must never waver in persisting in deepening 
reform. 
In the meantime, we also must control well the weight and pace 
of reform, so that they conform with the capability of the 
state, society, enterprises and the masses. This will enable us 
to limit to a controllable scope the impacts and frictions 
occurring in the course of replacing the old system with the new. 
  Second, reform is a large and systematic social project. 
Various reform measures are mutually linked with and constrain 
each other. If we fail to attach importance to coordination, 
cooperation and mutual care, we tend to deepen reform in 
isolation, or feel it difficult to advance or to retreat. This 
will trigger thorny social problems. For instance, in reforming 
our labor and employment system without the establishment and 
improvement of our social insurance system, it will be difficult 
for us to take a big step. If we act rashly, we are liable to 
lose more than we gain. Let us take another example. If 
enterprises fail to make marked progress in transforming their 
operational mechanisms, it naturally will be difficult to turn 
several large state-owned banks into genuine commercial banks. 
If we move too fast, we might possibly "strangle" a number of 
enterprises that originally stood a very good chance of success 
in invigorating themselves. The examples cited above tell us 
the truth: While promoting reform, we must adopt an overall 
point of view to control well its progress and weight, so that 
we can act in tacit agreement to advance reform in a coordinated 
manner. In so doing, we can ease up many contradictions, and 
avoid their intensification. This will make the work of 
handling them easy. 
  Third, it is necessary for us to do thoroughgoing and 
painstaking ideological work. The reform we are carrying out 
proceeds from the greatest interests of the broad masses of 
people. If we view adjustment of interest relationships and the 
redistribution of certain power in an isolated way, we might 
think that some people gain more than they lose, or vice versa. 
As a whole, however, our success in reform will greatly 
emancipate and develop our country's social productive forces, 
and will vigorously arouse the enthusiasm of our entire people. 
This will enable our motherland to become strong and powerful 
more quickly, and enable our people to improve their livelihood. 
Our people are always reasonable. As long as we can state the 
reasons clearly, they not only can fully understand certain 
inconveniences and difficulties brought to some of them by 
contradictions arising in the present-day reform, but also can 
actively help the government solve these contradictions, and be 
of one heart and one mind to push forward our great cause of 
socialist reform.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Lijun (1728 0500 6511): "Jilin Holds a </F>
Work Conference on Management of Rural Financial Affairs"] 
  [Text] Reporter learned from the provincial work conference 
on management of the rural financial affairs that concluded a 
few days ago that in 1994 and 1995 the province will make "six 
cleanups and six changes" in the rural financial affairs. Wang 
Guofa, vice governor of the provincial government, made a speech 
at the conference. 
  After summing up the province's achievements in rural 
financial affairs made over the past years, the conference 
pointed out: Now, problems in the management of rural financial 
affairs, which are in urgent need of solution, still exist. 
That is, the accumulated funds of agriculture are still being 
drained, the funds obtained by some localities according to a 
unified plan are not well managed, there are more instances of 
illegally interfering in the management and the flow of 
accumulated funds, the problems due to the raising of the 
interest rates by the collectives and the problems relating to 
"two debts" prominently exist, the rural areas fail to 
effectively manage their financial affairs, some localities have 
abolished county- and township-level agricultural economic 
centers, some localities delegate the rights to the management 
of rural financial affairs to towns and townships, and some 
localities "wean" the rural areas from the management of their 
financial affairs. So, the rural areas are lacking in basic 
work conditions and basic organizations. 
  To this end, the conference urged: To strengthen the 
management of the rural financial affairs in 1994 and 1995, we 
should win a victory in the overall battle of "six cleanups and 
six changes." "Six cleanups" indicate: Square accounts to solve 
the problems due to complicated accounting; clear up collective 
property to protect and expand the collective sector of the 
economy; clear up internal and external debts to eliminate rural 
debt chains; eliminate the raising of interest rates to solve 
the problems of being heavily in debt; eliminate the peasants' 
burdens to resolutely end the activities of wantonly collecting 
funds, asking for charges, and apportioning expenses; and clear 
up excessive staff members to solve overstaffing. 
  "Six changes" indicate: Implement the provincial people's 
congress "regulations" on management of funds, "regulations" on 
contracts, and "regulations" on the auditing work of the rural 
areas, as well as the "regulations" on the peasants' burden as 
stipulated by the state and the province -- both old and new 
accumulated funds used to be "owned and managed by communities" 
in the past and will be "converted into stocks and managed by 
townships"; change the decentralized management of the funds 
obtained according to the unified plan into centralized 
management; change the peasants' burdens from unitary shares to 
collection of funds from various channels; the basic work 
relating to the management of financial affairs has been changed 
from management at will to standardized management; change the 
ways for management of rural financial affairs from unitary 
administration to legalization; and change the ways for sorting 
out rural financial affairs from periodic cleanup to regular 
auditing examinations. The "six cleanups" and "six changes" 
will be conducted among villages, communities (groups), 
collective economic organizations and their subordinate 
enterprises, enterprises, institutions, township-level 
enterprises, and town- and township-level financial affairs 
stations and offices. 
  The conference stressed: The governments at various levels 
and all departments concerned should upgrade their understanding 
and realistically strengthen the leadership over the work 
relating to the cleanups and changes. On the basis of deeply 
conducting investigations and study and firmly grasping the 
implementation of the laws and regulations, we should strengthen 
the setup of the rural financial affairs management 
organizations. In the course of conducting the organizational 
reform, the governments at various levels must not reduce the 
staff and funds of the rural economic stations, still less "cut 
the subsidies to them."

  [Text] Lanzhou, June 22 (XINHUA) -- More than 1,700 
multi-functional markets have been built in northwest China's 
Gansu Province, attracting both domestic and overseas business 
people. 
  The state reform and opening-up policy has been an eye 
opener 
for this remote province. 
  For this inland province, the construction of the markets 
has 
promoted exchanges and circulation of commodities between Gansu 
and other parts of China. 
  Lanzhou, capital of the province, is now the biggest 
wholesale and commodity distribution center in northwest China, 
especially in garments, daily-use articles, manufactured goods 
and cloth materials. 
  The Lanzhou Guanghui cloth material wholesale market is now 
one of the six biggest of its kind in China. 
  Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture is one the biggest 
wholesale 
centers of leather, wool, timber and tea in the northwest. 
  With rich resources of nonferrous minerals and petrochemical 
products, the northwest petrochemical market in Lanzhou is now 
the biggest in China. 
  The brisk markets have also helped farmers to gauge the real 
value of their products such as apples, pears, dates and some 
precious Chinese medicinal herbs which sell well on the domestic 
market. 
  Farmers in Gangu county have founded their own grain, edible 
oil, timber and garment markets. 
  Increasing numbers of farmers have engaged in business and 
transportation. They have become more and more aware of the 
importance of market information in production.

  [Text] Beijing, June 23 (AFP)--China welcomed Thursday the 
resumption of talks between Washington and Pyongyang over the 
North Korean nuclear crisis, hailing the move as a "turning 
point." 
  "We are happy to see these positive developments... and 
appreciate the wise attitude and cooperative efforts by the 
various parties concerned for the peaceful settlement of this 
issue," Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said at a weekly 
press conference. 
  President Bill Clinton announced Wednesday that North Korea 
had agreed to freeze its nuclear programme, opening the door to 
high-level talks with the United States in Geneva next month. 
  During negotiations, Washington will suspend efforts to 
pursue UN sanctions against North Korea for refusing to allow 
inspection of its nuclear facilities. 
  "We sincerely hope all the parties concerned will treasure 
and grasp this hard-won turning point," Wu said, adding that 
dialogue, rather than sanctions "is the most fundamental way for 
a peaceful and proper settlement of the Korean nuclear issue." 
  China has repeatedly opposed the idea of UN sanctions and Wu 
clearly indicated that Beijing felt the latest developments were 
a vindication of that stance. 
  "Ever since this North Korean nuclear question cropped up, 
China has resolutely insisted that it be resolved through 
dialogue instead of through exerting pressure," Wu said. 
  "I believe this is an important act China has done." 
  He also welcomed Pyongyang's agreement to preparatory talks 
with Seoul for a summit between North Korean President Kim 
Il-Song and his South Korean counterpart, Kim Yong-Sam. 
  Asked whether China was satisfied that North Korea is not 
following a nuclear weapons programme, Wu would only reiterate 
China's commitment to the denuclearisation of the Korean 
peninsula. 
  "China does not wish to see the emergence of nuclear weapons 
on the Korean peninsula, whether from the North of from the 
South or any other countries," Wu said.

  [Text] Beijing, June 23 (AFP)--China emphatically denied 
Thursday a Beijing-backed Hong Kong newspaper report that 
paramount leader Deng Xiaoping had made a rare public appearance 
in the northeastern coastal city of Qingdao. 
  "This report is not true," Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu 
Jianmin told a weekly press briefing. 
  In a front-page article published Thursday, Wen Wei Po said 
Deng's trip took place recently and quoted the 89-year-old 
Chinese leader as telling local officials in Qingdao that China 
"must not have a multi-party system." 
  The official rejection of the detailed report, which quoted 
what were described as authoritative sources, was unusual given 
the fact that the Wen Wei Po is backed by Beijing and often used 
by the Chinese authorities. 
  Asked to clarify Deng's present whereabouts, Wu said simply: 
"Mr. Deng Xiaoping is wherever he is." 
  Deng's last public appearance was at Lunar New Year in 
February when he appeared on Shanghai television looking frail 
and physically supported by his daughters. 
  The ailing leader's health is a constant source of intense 
speculation.

  [Text] Beijing, June 23 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman explained here this afternoon why China has 
abstained from voting on the UN Security Council bill 
authorizing France dispatching troops for humanitarian 
intervention in Rwanda. 
  "The action authorized by the UN Security Council resolution 
at present is not guaranteed of cooperation and consent by the 
parties to the conflict in Rwanda," the spokesman said in the 
weekly news conference. 
  "In view of this, China has abstained on the vote." 
  He said that since the Rwanda crisis occurred, China has 
constantly followed the development of the events in that 
country. 
  "At present the situation in Rwanda is continuing to 
aggravate and the humanitarian conditions in that country are 
becoming increasingly grim, and we support efforts of the 
international community to help end the crisis in Rwanda and 
remove the miserable plight of the Rwanda people as soon as 
possible. 
  "In the meantime, it is our belief that it is an 
indispensable condition for the success of UN Peace-keeping 
operation to obtain the consent of the parties concerned, and to 
obtain the cooperation of the countries and regional 
organizations concerned," he said.

<F P=106> [By Sheel Kohli in London] </F>
  [Text] As trading started in the foreign exchange capital 
of the world yesterday, hardened City currency dealers were 
waiting for signs that the rescue party for the U.S. dollar was 
on the way. Until the G7 (Group of Seven) mobilised their 
official banks into the markets the dollar would be on a one-way 
ride, they warned. "If the central banks don't all step in 
together soon, then we're going to see the U.S. dollar go into 
free-fall because the speculators don't care. They want to see 
how low it can go," said one London trader. 
  Late last night, European time, the Japanese yen dipped 
through the emotive level of 100 yen to the U.S. dollar. At one 
point, the yen was trading in Europe at 99.85 the lowest level 
that the U.S. dollar has reached since the end of World War 11, 
reflecting a new aggressiveness among global foreign exchange 
speculators. 
  The consequences are far-reaching. For Japan, which is now 
emerging from one of its longest recessions, the marketability 
of the yen is paramount if a successful economic recovery is to 
be achieved. This week saw what is believed to have been a US$1 
billion injection by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) just before the 
Tokyo close on Tuesday with the dollar being bought at 
reportedly 100.4 yen, 100.6 yen and 101 yen. 
  Phil Luxton, a currency analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd 
said there was a feeling that speculators wanted to see how long 
it would be before the central banks of the G7 nations stepped 
in. "They (the speculators) are probing all the time, and 
trying to find the level at which the central banks will move 
in." 
  Clearly, as the current low level of the yen has shown, 
occasional intervention by the BOJ is not enough, and a 
concerted effort is needed. What surprised the City yesterday 
was the almost blase attitude that seemed to be adopted by the 
U.S. central bank, the Federal Reserve towards any kind of 
intervention. If a concerted effort is to be made, the Federal 
Reserve will have to determine the timing, and several observers 
expected key clues to be revealed in Federal Reserve chairman 
Alan Greenspan's address to the House of Representatives' budget 
committee last night. 
  Options available to the Federal Reserve were seen to be to 
increase interest rates significantly to give added confidence 
to the dollar, or to advocate concerted intervention by the G7 
central banks. The market has for a long time been betting on a 
rise in U.S. interest rates to six per cent by the end of the 
year. 
  Nick Clube of Smith New Court said central bankers 
everywhere 
would be keeping a close eye on the effect that the currency 
turmoil would have on the bond and equity markets. "It is to do 
with bonds and equities, if they are being adversely affected, 
the banks will feel more pressure to come in." Lee Ferridge of 
Natwest Markets said banks were possibly waiting for the market 
to become too short on dollars before teaching it a hard, sharp 
lesson by intervening and pushing up rates significantly. 
  The question of central bank intervention also puts into 
focus the mark-dollar relationship. Adrian Cunningham of Union 
Bank of Switzerland said the delay over intervention might have 
been caused by reluctance on the part of the Bundesbank, where 
the mark was trading at a comfortable 1.5982/5992 to the dollar. 
"The Bundesbank is not unhappy about the dollar-mark rate at 
1.60. It isn't perceived by the Bundesbank to be a problem." 
The decision by the Bundesbank to shave 0.05 per cent off the 
repo rate to five per cent was in itself an act of support 
without intervention because it buoyed sentiment in the belief 
that Germany was happy to cut repo even though official rates 
were on hold, he said. However, he suggested the Bundesbank 
would need to fund the budget, and would be looking for finance 
from a market which had faith in its currency policy. 
  Another story doing the rounds was that the United States 
might be punishing Japan over their enduring trade dispute, 
knowing that a strong yen would keep Japanese exports down. But 
that theory was also dismissed because the United States would 
be well-aware of the long-term economic damage such a policy 
could wreak on its own domestic market.

<F P=106> [By Simon Fluendy] </F>
  [Text] Few will need reminding that the direction of the 
United States dollar has a big effect on world equity and bond 
markets. On Monday night equity prices around the world dived 
on the back of a weakening dollar. But if that bad news was not 
enough to wreck what was left of Hong Kong's sentiment, then the 
eventual effects on the territory's economy from the greenback's 
crash could be worse. 
  Because of the peg, anything that happens to America's 
dollar 
also affects Hong Kong's currency. In the short to medium-term 
it might be of some benefit to foreign companies in Hong Kong 
worried about the cost of doing business here. If their home 
currency is European or Japanese then they will get more for 
their Hong Kong buck than before. But that will soon be 
overridden by higher prices for things the territory brings in 
from the outside world--things such as food, cars and steel. 
And that will lead to inflation. As the cost of imports rises, 
so the cost is passed on--to consumers who buy imported goods in 
shops, or to companies who buy equipment or raw materials from 
overseas. The effects are compounded by the push for higher 
wages to cope with the higher cost of imports and the cycle then 
repeats itself. 
  Multi-national companies in Hong Kong will hardly suffer. 
They have their pick of sources and currencies and are 
insulated from some of the effects of a falling dollar. It is 
the individual consumer and smaller companies who are likely to 
suffer most. Traders and exporters busily turning drums of 
polymer into Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod's action 
figures will initially be seduced by the thought of being able 
to offer lower yen prices to Japanese customers and lower mark 
prices to European customers. 
  But as the effects of a devaluing dollar are pushed through 
the system, that feeling will fade. Hong Kong imports huge 
amounts from Japan $178.03 billion last year and most of that is 
in consumer goods such as cars. As the price of Japanese goods 
rises, Hong Kong will likely start to feel the effects both in 
extra costs and in higher wage demands, as higher import prices 
convert into wage inflation. 
  The question is: How big an effect and how soon? It is not 
easy to answer. There are those who will argue that a stronger 
yen will act only at the margins of the economy. Most imports 
from Japan are consumer goods and many will be pushed straight 
out again in the form of reexports or tourist purchases. The 
second factor to consider with Japan is the scale of Japanese 
investment in Hong Kong and China. It has not been noted much 
in Europe or the US yet, but Japan's foreign policy has long 
shifted from its trading relationship with the West to its 
relationships in Asia. 
  In the old days, the giant Japanese firms were tumbling over 
each other to open factories inside Fortress Europe. No longer. 
And when trade talks broke down a few months ago, the Japanese 
almost shrugged their shoulders. With the passing of the 
generation which was old enough to see and understand World War 
II, Japan is again trying to extend its ties in the region. The 
bad blood is diminishing and in its place is a hunger for cheap 
Japanese loans and the friendly hand of a nation willing to take 
equity stakes in even the most crumbling ruin in China not just 
because of future potential, but because of the disaster which 
hangs over the whole region if China's economic reforms spin out 
of control and end up a failure. 
  Japan's Foreign Ministry is now far more interested in 
China's continued prosperity and stability that it is in what 
becomes of the U.S. dollar. If the dollar dives, there is that 
much less danger of U.S. President Bill Clinton trying to beat 
the Japanese trade surplus into submission. Meanwhile, Japan 
gets on with the business at hand--making Asia great. 
  If the money which Japan is presently pulling out of the 
U.S. 
dollar finds its way to Hong Kong it will obviously be good 
news. The cloud on the horizon is in the form of reports from 
brokers that Japanese clients are going to cash in Hong Kong to 
insulate themselves from currency loss. Better to think that 
every dollar the Japanese take out of the U.S. to protect 
themselves from the fall is a dollar which could find its way 
back into building up Asia.

<F P=106> [By Donald Last] </F>
  [Text] The greenback is likely to plumb new depths against 
the Japanese yen and, having broken through the pyschological 
barrier of 100 yen, could fall to 90-95 in the the near future 
say analysts and traders. Tuesday's break in the dollar to a 
post-war low against the yen of 99.95 cast a chill in Tokyo. "I 
thought 100 yen was the mother of all defensive positions" for 
the dollar, Chris Calderwood, Barclays de Zoete Wedd's economist 
in Tokyo, said. "If you cannot defend that, you cannot defend 
anything." 
  Though global bond markets were steadier yesterday, the bond 
and forex markets remain febrile. In the forex, the U.S. dollar 
recovered to 100.80 against the yen and just above 1.60 German 
marks. In the bond markets, the U.S. Treasury benchmark 30-year 
bond firmed slightly and the yield fell from 7.50 per cent to 
7.46 percent in Tokyo and European trading. 
  Markets were hoping for some signs from U.S. Federal Reserve 
chairman, Alan Greenspan in his Humphrey Hawkins testimony 
before Congress yesterday but he deliberately eschewed any 
mention of the ailing dollar. He simply noted that further 
increases in pressure on manufacturing capacity risked emerging 
inflation. The U.S. factory operating rate is now 83 per cent, 
not far from the 85 percent which many economists consider 
inflationary. 
  Apart from the Bank of Japan selling yen against dollars 
yesterday, the other central banks, and especially the U.S. 
Federal Reserve, were conspicuous by their absence. This is in 
strong contrast to early-May when they interevened to buy 
dollars en masse. "Having gone to a new post-war low the foreign 
exchange markets will now probe the downside to search out 
central bank policy on interest rates and the dollar," Ian 
McKinnon, Citibank's chief economist in London, said. The 
central banks have said that a stronger yen is bad for world 
trade because it threatens to prolong the Japanese recession and 
"the markets want to see some heavy-duty intervention, some 
action to support words", he said. 
  The dollar's fresh weakness against the yen has sparked 
worries that the Federal Reserve may be forced into further rate 
hikes which in turn would hit global bond and stockmarkets. "I 
believe the Federal Reserve will use the next policymaking Open 
Market Committee meeting July 5 to 6 to raise Fed funds another 
quarter point and then up them again in August," said Mitsubishi 
Finance International's head of research in London, Brendan 
Brown, who estimates second quarter U.S. gross domestic product 
is running at 4 to 5 percent annualised. 
  The coming Naples Summit (July 8-9) of the major 
industrialised Group of Seven (G7) club would seem to call for 
central bank actions to calm markets down, S G Warburg said in a 
forex report. "It would be embarrassing to say the least for G7 
leaders to welcome a global recovery with the dollar in free 
fall and bond/stockmarkets melting." If no interest rate action 
is taken by the Fed "the dollar can hardly be expected to 
stabilise, let alone change course", Warburgs said. 
  Pressure will also be on the Bank of Japan to cut rates to 
take the pressure off the yen and help preserve Japan's economic 
recovery. Market participants believe the Bank of Japan will 
have to cut its 1 and 3/4 percent discount rate if the yen hits 
95 against the dollar.

  [Text] United Nations, June 22 (XINHUA) -- The U.N. 
Security Council approved today a French initiative of sending 
troops to Rwanda on a humanitarian mission despite strong 
opposition from Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), who has claimed 
that such an intervention is against the U.N.-back Arusha 
agreement. 
  The Tutsi-dominated RPF said the Arusha peace agreement, 
which was signed in August, 1993, permitted no foreign military 
presence in Rwanda, thus it regarded sending French troops to 
Rwanda as a violation of the agreement. 
  The vote on the initiative is 10-0, with five abstentions by 
China, Brazil, Pakistan, New Zealand and Nigeria. 
  Under the resolution, France will deploy as early as 
Thursday 
[23 June] a French-commanded 2,700 French and Senegalese troops 
in Rwanda with the mandate of saving lives and setting up safe 
havens for refugees. The mission will last two months. 
  The Council said in the resolution that is was deeply 
concerned by the continued slaughter of civilians and by an 
expected delay of at least two months before all U.N. 
peacekeeping troops can be deployed. 
  Speaking to reporters after the Council meeting, Gerald 
Gahima, spokesman for the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) said the 
Council resolution was "totally unacceptable." 
  The United Nations may have its "choice" of sending troops 
to 
Rwanda, but it has also to bear the "responsibility" for its 
action. 
  He demanded the U.N. withdrawal from Rwanda the U.N. 
Assistance Mission for Rwanda (Unamir) because the mission had 
become groundless for U.N. violation of the Arusha agreement. 
[sentence as received] 
  "We can not handle with two forces at one time," he said. 
  The RPF has long accused France siding with the 
Hutu-dominated government and said the French Government trained 
the Hutu presidential guard, which has done most of the killings 
since April, after the Rwandan president was killed in a plane 
crash. 
  China said, before the Council's voting, that gaining 
support 
and cooperation from warring parties is an indispensable 
condition for the success of any U.N. peacekeeping operation. 
  Since there was no assurances of cooperation from the 
warring 
parties, China would abstain the draft resolution, said Chen 
Jian, deputy permanent representative to the United Nations. 
  Chen also reminded Council members of the lesson of the U.N. 
mission in Somali, which has been widely regarded as a U.N. 
failure in injecting forces without the consent of the warring 
parties.

  [Text] Beijing, June 22 (XINHUA) -- The lasting -- even 
growing -- influence of the five principles of peaceful 
co-existence, first formulated by China, have been underlined 
here in the run-up to the 40th anniversary of the "birthday" of 
these tenets. 
  The five principles, which were first proposed by China and 
were then initially advocated by China, India and Myanmar (the 
former Burma) have had great impact on China's diplomacy and 
international relations, said former Chinese Foreign Minister 
Huang Hua in a recent interview with XINHUA. 
  In the interview, the veteran diplomat said that the five 
principles of peaceful co-existence, namely mutual respect for 
sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, 
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and 
mutual benefit and peaceful co-existence, were the result of a 
developing process. 
  Back on the eve of the founding of New China, Huang 
recalled, 
late Chairman Mao Zedong had spelled out three principles -- 
equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect for territory and 
sovereignty -- as the basis for China to establish diplomatic 
links with foreign countries. 
  Huang, foreign minister in the late 1970s and early 1980s, 
recalled that China proposed the addition of "non-interference 
in each other's internal affairs" as a new principle to the 
above three principles in a Sino-Soviet pact signed in February, 
1950. 
  At a meeting in Beijing with an Indian Government delegation 
in December, 1953, late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai put forward 
for the first time the five principles of peaceful co-existence, 
which met with warm response from India, Huang said. 
  On June 28, 1954, China and India issued a joint statement 
in 
which the two countries affirmed that the five principles of 
peaceful co-existence should be the criterion guiding bilateral 
relations, Huang noted. 
  "And that day was regarded as the birthday of the five 
principles," he said, adding that on the same month, these 
principles were also clearly stated in a Sino-Burmese statement. 
  The five principles received warm support from 
newly-independent countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, 
Huang continued. 
  The five principles had been accepted by more and more 
countries and international organizations after the Bandung 
Conference in April, 1954, in Indonesia, at which ten principles 
were drawn up on the basis of the five principles, Huang said. 
  Fu Hao, former deputy foreign minister of China, said that 
the five principles played an important role in making New 
China's voice heard across the world when China was blocked and 
relatively isolated. 
  Fu, a political counsellor of the Chinese Embassy in India 
in 
the 1950s, said that Sino-Indian relations improved quickly 
after the proclamation of the five principles, and "China fever" 
was seen in India as a result. 
  The Indian people often mentioned the five principles when 
meeting with Chinese personnel. 
  The then Indian ambassador to China, the second ambassador 
to 
this country, before leaving his post for home, asked Chairman 
Mao's signature as a memento. Mao obliged by writing two lines 
of ancient Chinese verse on a white paper cover of a fan: "A 
bosom friend afar brings the distance closer." 
  Former Deputy Foreign Minister Han Nianlong said the five 
principles had undergone dozens of years of tests in a changing 
world. 
  Time had shown that international relations could not be 
handled fairly and reasonably in the forms of big family, group 
politics, power sphere or world leader, Han said. 
  He added that the five principles, emphasizing solving 
international conflicts through negotiations and talks on equal 
footings, are in keeping with the developing trend of the world. 
  Wu Xueqian, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and former 
foreign minister, believed that the five principles are 
important in the international arena because they go beyond the 
limits by social system and ideology, and conform to the 
principles of sovereignty and equality specified in the United 
Nations charter. 
  Wu added that the five principles are clearer and easier to 
understand than the UN Charter. 
  On the current significance of the five principles, Liu 
Shuqing, president of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign 
Affairs and former vice-foreign minister, said the five 
principles had always put a rein on the practices of hegemonism 
and power politics. 
  Despite the end of the Cold War, Liu said, the phenomenon of 
unfair play is very common in world affairs, and peace and 
development are facing serious challenges. 
  In recent years, a few powers, propagating "sovereignty is 
outmoded," and "human rights ahead of sovereignty," have tried 
to interfere in other countries' internal affairs, Liu said, 
which indicates that though the five principles have been 
accepted by the world, not all countries act accordingly. 
  "At present many countries are very concerned with 
establishing a new international political and economic order," 
Liu said. 
  "What kind of new order does the world need? it is clear 
that the new order cannot be just and reasonable and accepted by 
most countries unless it is based on the five principles of 
peaceful co-existence," he stressed.

  [Text] Washington, June 22 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton today pledged U.S. support for the Middle East peace 
process to Jordan's King Husayn. 
  "I want to reaffirm the support of the United States for a 
comprehensive settlement in the Middle East," Clinton told 
reporters at the White House before meeting with Husayn. 
  Clinton expressed his welcome to King Husayn back to the 
White House [as received] and said that "I support his courage 
and vision in renewing his efforts to make peace with Israel." 
  "This remains a very important priority for me and for our 
administration, and I am very encouraged by where we are now in 
the whole process, and especially by efforts that King Husayn 
has made," the President said. 
  It was reported that King Husayn was ready to take major 
steps toward normal relations with Israel and would not wait for 
similar progress in Israel's dealings with other Arab countries. 
  Asked if he is seeking a separate peace with Israel, Husayn 
said that "I'm seeing the beginning of serious negotiation on 
the agenda that was ratified here in Washington as rapidly as 
possible" [as received]. 
  "This is what we expected to be engaged in in the coming 
period," Husayn said, "but beyond that, we certainly would share 
with the President our hope that we will have a comprehensive 
peace in the entire region."

  [Text] Washington, June 22 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton welcomed today what he called Russia's "far-sighted 
choice" of joining NATO's Partnership for Peace program. 
  In a ceremony celebrating the 50th anniversary of the 
signing 
of a bill aiding World War Two veterans, Clinton said the 
Russian move was "another step on our long road in man's 
everlasting quest for peace." 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev signed the documents 
in Brussels today. Moscow was 21st nation to join the program 
that covers joint planning and exercises and other consultations. 
  At the Brussels ceremony, Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of 
State 
Warren Christopher announced that Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin will visit Washington in September. 
  Before the September trip, Yeltsin will meet Clinton in 
Naples, Italy, during the July summit of the seven 
industrialized nations. 
  In a separate development, U.S. Vice President Al Gore 
opened 
two days of talks with Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin on space, trade, energy and environment cooperation. 
  Both Gore and Chernomyrdin are leading several joint 
U.S.-Russian committees working on the related areas. 
  The committees, established 14 months ago during Clinton's 
meeting with Yeltsin in Vancouver, Canada, are having their 
third meeting here. 
  They are expected to sign a number of agreements on 
cooperation in space exploration, oil and gas production and 
environmental protection.

  [Text] Seoul, June 23 (XINHUA) -- South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam was told by his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton today 
that negotiations are underway to discuss resuming the 
high-level talks between Washington and Pyongyang in Geneva 
early next month. 
  Kim and Clinton were talking about concerted measures on 
Pyongyang's nuclear issue in a telephone conversation, according 
to the presidential office. 
  Clinton phoned Kim this morning and explained the background 
of the U.S. decision to agree to a third round of high-level 
talks with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). 
  Clinton disclosed that the DPRK has agreed not to refuel its 
nuclear reactor at Yongbyon or reprocess spent fuel and has 
guaranteed continuous monitoring by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  The U.S. President said that he welcomes the inter-Korean 
agreement to hold a summit and he is encouraged to see things 
are developing rapidly to lay the groundwork for the summit. 
  Kim, in the meantime, said that he has praised the DPRK's 
acceptance of Seoul's offer for a preliminary contact next week 
for the inter-Korean summit. 
  He also noted that his government is pushing for the 
inter-Korean summit with the "absolute support" of the people. 
  Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter went to Pyongyang last 
week and brought back a message to Seoul that President Kim 
Il-song wants to hold a summit with South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam. 
  Seoul immediately accepted and proposed a pre-summit 
working-level contact at the truce village of Panmunjom on the 
morning of June 28. 
  Yesterday, the DPRK notified South Korea of its acceptance 
of 
Seoul's proposal.

<F P=106> ["Roundup"] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, June 22 (XINHUA) -- After a half year of 
arduous bargaining, Russia, the major heir to the former Soviet 
Union, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) finally 
achieved the compromises necessary to enable Moscow to join 
NATO's Partnership for Peace program. 
  On Tuesday [21 June], Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev 
flew to Brussels, headquarters of the treaty organization, to 
sign the Partnership for Peace program originally proposed by 
U.S. President Bill Clinton in response to some eastern European 
countries' desire for NATO memberships. 
  Shortly after the signing ceremony, Kozyrev and NATO Deputy 
Secretary General Sergio Balanzino announced at a press 
conference a cooperation protocol between Russia and NATO 
setting forth general principles for their future relations. 
  The protocol, put forward by Moscow as a precondition for 
joining the Partnership for Peace program, acknowledges Russia's 
major power status and its influence in Europe, stating that 
Russia and NATO will have extensive dialogue and cooperation and 
conduct political consultations on European and global security 
and peacekeeping missions. 
  NATO has placed some restrictions on Russia's request for 
more political consultation on security issues. Both sides will 
remain independent in their decision making, the NATO leadership 
pointed out today. 
  In fact, the two documents reflect the concessions made by 
both sides after six months of bargaining. 
  Their differences focused on whether a special relationship 
would be established between them. 
  Since U.S. President Clinton proposed the program in 
January, 
Russia had repeatedly changed its position on the issue in an 
effort to gain special relations with NATO commensurate with its 
status as a world power. 
  NATO, however, insisted that all participants in the 
Partnership for Peace plan be equal and demanded that Russia 
first join the program before discussing any special 
relationship. 
  At a meeting of NATO defence ministers in Brussels on May 
25, 
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev announced that Russia 
would join the Partnership for Peace plan "unconditionally." 
  But he proposed that in the meantime Russia and NATO 
establish more extensive cooperation in military and security 
matters and urged NATO to sign a separate cooperation agreement 
with Russia on European and global security. 
  Evidently, special ties between Russia and NATO remained the 
cornerstone of the new conception proposed by Grachev. 
  Essentially, Russia wanted greater say in international 
affairs, specifically, the right of veto on international issues 
within the framework of the treaty organization. 
  The dilemma facing NATO was that it could neither neglect 
Russia's request nor meet it. 
  On the one hand, NATO hoped Russia would join the program 
because a new security mechanism in Europe could hardly work 
without Russia's participation, and NATO did not want to 
irritate the nuclear power by disregarding its request. 
  On the other hand, NATO worried that other countries would 
be 
displeased if special relations were established with Russia. 
  The treaty organization was also trying to prevent Russia 
from taking advantage of special relations in order to 
strengthen its role in NATO. 
  As a compromise, NATO was ready to take Russia's world power 
status into consideration without conceding the right of veto. 
  In light of NATO's tough stance, Russia readjusted its 
policy. At a NATO meeting in Istanbul on June 10, Kozyrev 
announced that Russia would soon sign the partnership for peace 
plan. 
  Russia based this decision on the following considerations: 
  First, Russia wants to end its dispute with NATO for fear 
the 
quarrel could deepen mistrust between the two sides. 
  Second, Russia worries that it will become isolated when 
other eastern European countries and former Soviet republics 
join the program one after the other. 
  Third, Russia sees many uncertain factors in the program and 
should join in order to develop the situation in a direction 
favorable to the interests of the former Soviet republic. 
  With these compromises, Russia and NATO have finally signed 
the two documents. But differences remain over Russia's role in 
NATO and NATO's future role in general. 
  Therefore, both cooperation and disagreement will continue 
to 
dominate relations between Russia and NATO, and this 
relationship will, to a large extent, determine the future 
pattern of security in Europe.

  [Text] Washington, June 22 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton today tried to calm down nervous financial markets, 
saying the U.S. economy was fundamentally "very sound." 
  Speaking to reporters at the White House, Clinton minimized 
Tuesday's [21 June] plunge in the value of the dollars. 
  "Let me just emphasize that the dollar as you know is traded 
in big multinational markets with other currencies and they go 
up and down," the President said. "But the fundamental economic 
realities in this country are very sound." 
  He said the economy is growing, inflation is low and 
unemployment has dropped dramatically. "I think we just have to 
keep working on our fundamentals and in the end the markets will 
have to respond to economic realities of the American economy," 
Clinton said. 
  The U.S. dollars had plunged to a post-World War Two low 
against the Japanese yen and the lowest level in more than a 
year against the German mark Tuesday. 
  The Bank of Japan intervened today to slow the dollars's 
slide, but the German mark has retained its strength in 
international markets.

  [Text] Jiamusi, June 21 (CNS)--The Sino-Russian border 
trade which has been slack for nearly two years is now rising 
again. With China and Russia having had their economic policies 
in place, the Sino-Russian border trade is expected to be 
prosperous once again. 
  Since summer this year, trade talks between China and Russia 
have become more active. In an international economic and trade 
conference held in Jiamusi City in Heilongjiang Province in 
early June, the trade volume increased to RMB 5 billion 
[renminbi] from several hundred million made in such trade talks 
held in the past years. The recovery of the border trade was 
seen as one of important reasons. 
  The official in charge of the border trade in the City 
attributed the recovery of the Sino-Russian border trade to the 
following factors: 
  First, China and Russia have mutual-complementary market 
demands. Despite of Japanese and South Korean products pouring 
into the Russian market, it is hard for the Russian consumers to 
accept due to their high prices. Russians still prefer the 
Chinese products which are of good quality but sell at lower 
prices. On the other hand, China also needs Russian-made steel 
products, timber, glass, cars and machines as well as the 
advanced and new technology in particular. 
  The Chinese side and the Russian side have imposed strict 
inspection over passports held by their economic and trade staff 
and a ban on speculators to enter and leave their countries. 
The two sides have also reached the relevant agreement on 
development of the border trade. All these have created relaxed 
circumstances for the Sino-Russian border trade. 
  The Chinese customs and the foreign trade departments have 
strenghtened inspection over the exports to prevent counterfeit 
and low quality products from flowing out of the country. They 
have also hosted various kinds of exhibitions of Chinese 
products of high quality to raise confidence of the Russian 
consumers in the Chinese products.

  [Text] Beijing, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of 
China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, 
said here today that China and Tajikistan should become good 
neighbors on the basis of the five principles of peaceful 
co-existence. 
  Qiao made these remarks at a meeting with a delegation led 
by 
A.S. Dostiev, the first vice-chairman of the Supreme Soviet of 
Tajikistan [name and title as received], at the Great Hall of 
the People here this afternoon. 
  Dostiev agreed with Qiao's view, adding that Tajikistan and 
China have shared a peaceful border. "It is our hope that this 
will become a border of friendly cooperation between the two 
countries." 
  Qiao expressed the hope that the two countries will increase 
their contacts and understanding and boost cooperation in the 
fields of economy and culture. 
  He noted that Buhe, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing 
Committee, held very good talks with Dostiev, which will be 
conducive to promoting mutual understanding and friendship and 
provide the delegation with more information about China. 
  The two legislative departments' close contacts and exchange 
of experience will play a positive role in pushing forward 
bilateral ties, Qiao said. 
  He said he was very pleased that now Tajikistan's domestic 
environment is stable, and that he was sure that the country 
will move ahead continuously. 
  "China will be Tajikistan's good cooperating partner in the 
process of its development," he added. 
  Dostiev expressed his appreciation for China's pursuit of 
the 
five principles of peaceful co-existence in handling 
state-to-state relations. 
  As Tajikistan is a newly-independent country, he said it 
should learn from experience of other countries including China 
in both economic and legislative construction. 
  Buhe, vice-chairman of the Chinese NPC Standing Committee, 
was present at the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, June 23 (XINHUA) -- China will toe the line 
of the five principles of peaceful co-existence in handling 
foreign relations, stressed Vice-President Rong Yiren when 
meeting with a delegation led by A.S. Dostiev, first 
vice-chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan [name and 
title as received] here today. 
  Rong said that most friends on the delegation had come to 
China for the first time and hoped that the visit could improve 
mutual understanding. 
  He said the delegation's visit indicated that bilateral 
links 
had developed smoothly since China and Tajikistan set up 
diplomatic ties. 
  He said that China will develop relations and conduct 
friendly cooperation with foreign countries in accordance with 
the five principles of peaceful co-existence. 
  Strengthening exchanges and collaboration is beneficial for 
China and Tajikistan, both developing countries with the 
responsibilities of pushing the economies forward and raising 
people's living standards, Rong said. 
  On China's reform and opening drive, Rong said: "Though 
China's economy is growing quickly, the Chinese people's living 
standards, which have risen steadily, lag far behind those in 
developed countries. 
  "We will continue our efforts to catch up with the 
moderately-developed countries by the middle of the next 
century," he said. 
  Appreciating China's warm and friendly welcome, Dostiev said 
it embodied the friendship of China and the Chinese people 
toward Tajikistan and her people. 
  Dostiev said his current visit was aimed at furthering 
existing bilateral friendly cooperation, at getting a better 
understanding of China's 15 years of reform, and at learning 
successful experience suitable to Tajikistan's conditions. 
  Praising China's foreign and domestic policies, Dostiev said 
it is right for China to adhere to the five principles of 
peaceful co-existence in the world arena and stick to the 
construction of the socialist market economy within its 
territory.

"Fruitful Mediation"] 
  [Text] Between 13 and 18 June, former U.S. President Jimmy 
Carter shuttled between the DPRK and the ROK. After returning 
to the United States, he talked on the telephone with President 
Clinton and met with relevant senior U.S. officials in order to 
brief them about his visit to the Korean peninsula. This time, 
Mr. Carter promoted an exchange of opinions between the DPRK, 
the United States, and the ROK on the nuclear issue, and his 
mediation activity was fruitful and has eased the tense 
situation on the Korean peninsula to a certain degree. 
  In the recent period, the situation on the Korean peninsula 
became tense due to the nuclear issue. In particular, after the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] adopted a resolution 
to impose sanctions against the DPRK on 10 June and the DPRK 
announced its withdrawal from the IAEA on 13 June, dialogue 
between the various parties concerned on the nuclear issue in 
the DPRK was suspended, and the situation on the Korean 
peninsula was strained further. The United States and some 
other countries intensively planned to push the UN Security 
Council to pass a resolution on imposing sanctions against the 
DPRK. The U.S. and ROK armed forces carried out exercises and 
deployed "Patriot" missiles. The DPRK also issued repeated 
statements, saying that sanctions in any form would be regarded 
as an act of war against the DPRK. At this moment, Carter was 
invited to visit the Korean peninsula. Although it was just a 
private visit, it still attracted extensive attention from the 
international community. 
  Before visiting the DPRK, Carter first visited the ROK and 
held a meeting with President Kim Yong-sam. In Pyongyang, he 
met President Kim Il-song twice, and the two talked for a long 
time. After leaving the DPRK, Carter once again visited the ROK 
and conveyed a message from President Kim Il-song to President 
Kim Yong-sam. 
  Carter's mediation has achieved positive results: the DPRK 
allowed IAEA inspectors and monitoring equipment to remain in 
the DPRK, and agreed that the United States should send 
personnel to help the DPRK search for the remains of American 
soldiers killed in the Korean war. President Kim Il-song also 
expressed willingness to unconditionally meet with President Kim 
Yong-sam at any time and in any place. The ROK gave a positive 
reaction to this, and proposed that the two sides hold a meeting 
of deputy premiers on 26 June in Panmunjom to make preparations 
for the first summit meeting between the leaders of the south 
and the north, which will be an important event on the Korean 
Peninsula and will promote the peaceful settlement of the Korean 
nuclear issue and regional stability. 
  After returning to the United States, Carter talked on the 
telephone with President Clinton, and then told the press that 
"the crisis was over." He also said that efforts made by the 
United States to impose sanctions against the DPRK would "just 
delay and hold up the diplomatic actions." Although the White 
House expressed "prudent optimism" about Carter's visit to the 
DPRK, it still "greatly appreciated the former president's 
benign efforts." 
  All international opinion valued highly Mr. Carter's trip to 
the Korean peninsula. His mediating activities once again show 
that dialogue is better than confrontation and that continuing 
to seek political settlement is more favorable to the settlement 
of differences than recklessly imposing sanctions and exerting 
pressure. People believe that through further dialogue, the 
relevant parties involved in the Korean issue will certainly be 
able to find a way to settle the issue peacefully and will 
eventually realize the two objectives of making the Korean 
peninsula a nuclear-free zone and safeguarding the stability on 
the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Seoul, June 22 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea (DPRK) notified South Korea today that it has 
accepted Seoul's proposal for a preparatory contact on June 28 
for an inter-Korean summit, much to the welcome of the latter. 
  The DPRK, in a telephone message from Premier Kang Song-san 
to his South Korean counterpart Yi Yong-tok said that a 
seven-member delegation will go to the summit preparatory talks 
at the truce village of Panmunjom. 
  "The tense political situation on the peninsula has now made 
the opening of a summit more mandatory than at any other time," 
Kang said in the message. 
  He noted, this highest-level meeting of the two sides will 
be 
a historic event which will give the 70 million Korean people 
"the joy of reconciliation and unity" and renew hopes for a 
country of peace and unification. 
  A South Korean Government official welcomed the DPRK's 
reply, 
saying that "the message came within the quickest timeframe we 
had thought of and it was in agreement with our proposal. This 
suggests that they are sincere in approaching the summit." 
  After a visit to Pyongyang last week, former U.S. President 
Jimmy Carter took a message to Seoul that the DPRK's President 
Kim Il-song wants to hold a summit with South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam without delay. 
  Seoul immediately accepted and proposed a working-level 
contact at Panmunjom on the morning of June 28. 
  Some sources said Deputy Prime Minister and the National 
Unification Board (NUB) Minister Yi Hong-ku is the likely 
Seoul-side chief delegate to the contact meeting, while 
Pyongyang may send over its Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister 
Kim Yong-nam.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Agreement was reached 
today on the prospect of an inter-Korean summit which has been 
proposed by South Korea to help relieve the tension on the 
peninsula. 
  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Premier 
Kang 
Song-san said that his government will send a high-level 
delegation for the pre-summit talks. 
  Kang Song-san today notified his South Korean counterpart Yi 
Yong-tok that the DPRK has accepted Seoul's proposal for a 
preparatory meeting on June 28. 
  He said a seven-member DPRK delegation, to be headed by an 
official of vice-premier level, will travel to the truce village 
of Panmunjom for the meeting. 
  "The tense political situation on the peninsula has now made 
the idea of a summit more mandatory than at any other time," 
Kang said in the message. 
  He said that this high level meeting of the two sides will 
be 
an historic event. "It will give the 70 million Korean people 
the joy of reconciliation and unity and renew hopes for a 
country of peace and unification," added Kang. 
  "It has been the DPRK's consistent policy to remove distrust 
and confrontation between the North and the South and open a new 
phase of national reunification independently and peacefully," 
said the message. 
  On June 18, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who visited 
the DPRK on June 15-18, relayed to South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam an oral message from DPRK President Kim Il-song, saying 
he was ready to hold a North-South summit with Kim Yong-sam 
unconditionally and at any time or place. 
  Then on Monday [20 June] Yi Yong-tok suggested to Kang 
Song-san that a preliminary contact be made to discuss detailed 
arrangements for the summit, to be held at Panmunjom at 10:00 
A.M. local time on June 28 (Tuesday). 
  A South Korean Government official welcomed the DPRK's 
reply, 
saying that the message came within the quickest timeframe. "It 
was in agreement with our proposal and this suggests that they 
are sincere in approaching the summit," he added.

  [Text] Beijing, June 22 (XINHUA) -- A high-powered 
non-governmental organization was launched here today, 
reflecting China's growing interest in international economic 
cooperation and development in Northeast Asia. 
  The China Association for the Promotion of International 
Technological and Economic Cooperation in Northeast Asia, with 
members from the central government and provincial governments, 
prominent academic institutions and major companies, is poised 
to play a big role in mobilizing the countries and regions in 
Northeast Asia to form closer links in developing the regional 
economy. 
  "Though the countries and regions in northeast Asia differ 
widely in terms of economic development, the region, with rich 
labor and natural resources and a strong industrial foundation, 
has the greatest growth potential and brightest prospects for 
cooperation," said Ma Hong, honorary president of the 
association, who heads the Development Research Center of the 
State Council. 
  According to him, all countries in this region had expressed 
strong desires to promote international cooperation within the 
region. 
  The association has already established contacts with some 
domestic and overseas economic and technological organizations, 
social groups and investment groups and begun to explore ways of 
cooperation with them. 
  Some enterprise groups in Asia, America and Europe have even 
invited the association to launch joint ventures overseas. 
  "The expanded exchanges and cooperation will probably lead 
to 
the establishment of an international economic cooperation 
organization in Northeast Asia in the future," said an 
association official. 
  A specialists' committee will soon be set up within the 
association to study key issues related to regional cooperation 
and provide policy consultations for relevant departments of the 
State Council. 
  The association also plans to hold a large international 
academic symposium and trade fair in April or may next year, the 
official said.

  [Text] Canberra, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese State 
Councilor Li Tieying said today that China has confidence in 
re-entering the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Speaking at the Australia-China Business Council in 
Melbourne 
today, Li said that the Chinese Government has adopted a series 
of major reform measures since talks started on China's 
resumption of its GATT membership in 1986. 
  He said that China "will fulfill its due obligations and its 
economic and trade systems will be further integrated with the

  [Text] Canberra, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese State 
Councillor Li Tieying said today that foreign trade has played a 
prominent role in China's economic development. 
  In 1993, the total volume of China's import and export 
accounted for over 35 percent of its GNP, measured with the 
internationally accepted indicators, Li told the Australia-China 
Business Council in Melbourne this noon. 
  "Since 1979, China's total volume of foreign trade has been 
growing at an average annual rate of 16 percent," Li said in a 
speech at the luncheon in honor of him by the council. 
  Li said that this rate is higher than the growth rate of 
China's GDP and that of the world trade during the same period. 
  Li, who is also minister in charge of the State Commission 
for Restructuring the Economic Systems, arrived in Melbourne 
this morning for a nine-day visit to Australia after ending his 
tour to New Zealand. 
  He told the host that China has maintained favorable trade 
terms and its foreign exchange reserve is kept at the normal 
level, reaching 21.2 billion U.S. dollars at the end of last 
year. 
  Li said that it is China's basic national policy "to further 
expand its opening-up to the outside world, vigorously develop 
its foreign trade and widely involved itself in international 
cooperation and exchanges." 
  Last year, China's total import stood at 104 billion U.S. 
dollars and is estimated to reach 1,000 billion U.S. dollars in 
the next seven years. 
  "China's development cannot be achieved without cooperation 
with other countries," Li said. 
  He also said that "China's development and cooperation with 
other countries are also important for the promotion of world's 
economic and trade development and the maintenance of global 
peace and stability." 
  On the Sino-Australian bilateral economic relations, Li said 
that last year, the two countries enjoyed a two-way trade of 
three billion U.S. dollars, up nearly 29 percent on the previous 
year. 
  Australia has so far invested in over 1,300 projects in 
China, with a total contracted investment of 1.25 billion U.S. 
dollars, making it the ninth largest investor in China. 
  China has also set up over 70 non-trade enterprilion U.S. 
dollars. 
  Li said that the two countries have broad prospects for 
cooperation in the fields of economy, technology, culture and 
education.

  [Text] Canberra, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Beijing will continue 
to encourage foreign business to invest in China. 
  Speaking at the Australia-China Business Council in 
Melbourne 
this noon, China's State Councilor Li Tieying said that there 
would be no change in the preferential policies granted to 
foreign-funded enterprises. 
  He also said that foreign-funded enterprises will gradually 
enjoy the treatment granted to the Chinese people. 
  Li, who is also minister in charge of the State Commission 
for Restructuring the Economic Systems, arrived in Melbourne 
this morning for a nine-day visit to Australia. 
  "We will maintain the continuity of our foreign investment 
policy by continuing to encourage foreign investment into 
China," Li told the luncheon in honor of him by the council. 
  "China has always respected and protected the legal rights 
and interests of foreign businesses," Li said. "Treatment 
equivalent to that extended to Chinese nationals will be 
gradually granted to foreign enterprises." 
  Talking about the newly-introduced reforms of foreign 
exchange and foreign trade, Li said that a system of bank 
foreign exchange settlement and sales would be introduced for 
state-owned foreign trade enterprises. 
  "The existing practice will be maintained in regard to 
foreign-funded enterprises, namely, they can retain their cash 
accounts to facilitate their operation including import and 
export," he added. 
  On the reform of China's taxation system, Li said that it 
"does not, generally speaking, increase the overall tax burden 
on foreign-funded enterprise." 
  "For some enterprises whose tax burden does increase, 
corresponding compensation measures have been formulated to 
allow for the full entitlement of foreign businessmen to the 
preferential conditions set forth in China's laws and agreements 
for cooperation in China," Li said. 
  Li stressed that "there have been changes in any of the 
preferential policies regarding to foreign-funded enterprises." 
  The recent approval of China's foreign trade law will 
provide 
a better legal guarantee for foreign investment and trade 
activities in China, he added. 
  China has so far approved 170,000 foreign-invested projects, 
with the accumulated directed foreign investment exceeding 60 
billion U.S. dollars and over 70,000 foreign-funded enterprises 
already is [words indistinct].

recent years, the two countries have witnessed smooth growth of 
bilateral ties and strengthened cooperation in international 
affairs. 
  The strengthening of their cooperation in various fields is 
in line with the interests of the two nations, and is conducive 
to peace, stability and development in Asia and the world as a 
whole, said Qiao, who is chairman of the Standing Committee of 
China's National People's Congress. 
  Surjeet told Qiao that his visit is aimed at knowing more 
about China's policy of reform and opening to the world, its 
achievements as well as its problems.

obtained in recent years," he said. 
  The Communist Party of India (Marxist) speaks highly of Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and is confident of socialism's future, he said.

  [Text] Prague, June 16 (XINHUA) -- A Czech industrial 
product exhibition, the largest over recent years to be held in 
China, will take place this December in an effort to promote 
economic ties between the two countries. 
  According to reports, the Czech Government believes China's 
huge trade market is so attractive that it will send either its 
Minister of Industry and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy or Economic 
Minister Karel Dyba to attend the opening ceremony. 
  Prague is also planning to earmark 5 million korun (about 
220,000 U.S. dollars) to subsidize enterprises taking part in 
the exhibition, allocating 100,000 korun or some 4,400 dollars 
for each unit. 
  The Czech Republic exported products worth 250 million U.S. 
dollars to China last year, registering a 2.5 times increase 
over the previous two years. 
  They were chiefly machine tools, transport and brewery 
equipment and chemicals. It also imported raw materials, 
foodstuffs, textiles and other industrial products from China.

<F P=106> [By reporter Hu Guohua (5170 0948 5478)] </F>
  [Text] Guangzhou, 22 Jun (XINHUA) -- During his recent 
inspection of Guangdong, Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the 
CPC Central Committee, Chinese President, and chairman of the 
Central Military Commission, offered important opinions on the 
development of special economic zones. He pointed out: The 
establishment of special economic zones in China is an important 
step for promoting reform, opening up, and modernization. This 
move fully demonstrates Comrade Deng Xiaoping's and our party's 
enterprising spirit, farsightedness, revolutionary courage and 
resourcefulness, and political wisdom. I hope that people of 
the special economic zones, following the course set by Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping, based on the achievements and experiences they 
have gained, and through deepening reform in all fields, will 
revamp the economic structures, improve overall management, 
improve workers' training, improve the investment environment, 
improve economic efficiency, refine the democratic legal system, 
and promote spiritual civilization, to raise the overall 
economic and social development level to a new height. All in 
all, we should create new resources and raise our work to a new 
level. 
  From 15 to 21 June, accompanied by Comrade Xie Fei, member 
of 
the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the 
Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, and Comrade Zhu Senlin, 
governor of Guangdong Province, Comrade Jiang Zemin inspected 
Guangzhou, Foshan, Zhongshan, Zhuhai, Shenzhen, and Meizhou. 
During the trip, Jiang Zemin, ignoring fatigue, inspected 
factories and rural areas to keep himself abreast of the current 
industrial and agricultural production situation and the 
building of grass-roots party organizations. He was very happy 
to see the progress in reform and development in all areas. He 
said: Under the leadership of the Guangdong Provincial CPC 
Committee and government, Guangdong's developmental trends have 
been very good, and developments in the special economic zones 
have also been very good. The progress is indeed encouraging. 
  Wherever he went, Comrade Jiang Zemin cordially conversed 
with grass-roots cadres, technical workers, and the masses, 
discussing various issues with them and seeking their opinions. 
In Zhongshan City's Sanxiang Town and Meixian County's Fuda 
Town, he visited peasant households braving storms and muddy 
roads. He cordially engaged in small talk with peasants Zheng 
Xiangui, Zheng Dikun, and Liang Bo; visited their houses and 
farms; inquired about their incomes and lives; and hoped they 
would continue to work diligently to improve their livelihoods. 
  General Secretary Jiang Zemin heard work reports by the 
Zhuhai City CPC Committee, the Shenzhen City CPC Committee, the 
Meizhou City CPC Committee, and the Guangdong Provincial CPC 
Committee. He fully affirmed the tremendous achievements and 
contributions Guangdong and the special economic zones have made 
over the last 15 years. He said: The establishment of the 
special economic zones was an important strategic decision made 
by the party Central Committee and the State Council according 
to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's proposal. With the exploratory and 
diligent work over the last 15 years, the special economic zones 
in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and other localities have gained many 
valuable development experiences, making important contributions 
to the country's reform, opening up, and modernization drive. 
They have truly played an experimental role and served as the 
country's showcases and pacesetters. Practice proves that our 
decision to establish special economic zones is completely 
correct. The special economic zones' achievements and 
contributions are the result of the hard work and common efforts 
of the large numbers of constructors of the special economic 
zones; these achievements and contributions are also inseparable 
from the forceful support of other localities. 
  Jiang Zemin said: Our reform, opening up, modernization 
efforts, and economic and social development across the country 
are a closely knit and unified whole. Cooperation should be 
stepped up between special economic zones and other localities, 
between the Zhujiang Delta and the Chang Jiang Delta and the 
Bohaiwan region, and between coastal areas and the central and 
western parts of the country. They should make use of their own 
resources, fulfill each other's needs, and help each other make 
progress, so they can develop in a better and more coordinated 
manner. They must not try to replace others, especially not to 
exclude each other. All localities, particularly special 
economic zones and the more economically developed coastal 
areas, should self-consciously make contributions to the 
development of a nationally unified socialist market economy. 
  While discussing special economic zones' development 
experience, Jiang Zemin pointed out: The experience in building 
special economic zones all boils down to one point -- that is, 
we must unwaveringly insist on using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
the party's basic line as our guidance, and should emancipate 
our minds and do things in light of reality. We should be bold 
and yet steady; we should integrate theory with practice; we 
should create on our own while making use of others' experience; 
we should strive to create and develop Chinese characteristics 
and a Chinese style for our special economic zones. 
  While stressing that special economic zones should be 
further 
improved, Jiang Zemin said: The central authorities' resolve to 
develop special economic zones will not change; the central 
authorities' basic policy toward the special economic zones will 
not change; the special economic zones' status and role in the 
country's reform, opening up, and modernization drive will not 
change. We should interweave the development of special 
economic zones with the entire process of the socialist 
modernization drive. The view that special economic zones' 
status and role can be reduced or even gradually eliminated in 
the new situation in which a trend of all-front opening up to 
the outside world is being formed across the country is 
incorrect. 
  Jiang Zemin believes that the development of special 
economic zones has entered a new stage in which we should strive 
to improve the overall quality and create additional advantages 
of special economic zones. Then, under the new circumstances, 
how can the additional advantages be created and new progress be 
made? He discussed five important points to this end. 
  The first point is that special economic zones should 
continue to actively explore and gain more experience in 
accelerating the establishment of the socialist market economic 
structure across the country. Jiang Zemin said: In the special 
economic zones, we should accelerate the change of operational 
mechanisms of state-owned enterprises and establish a modern 
enterprise system. We should accelerate the cultivation and 
development of the market system, with emphasis on the 
development of the production-factors markets and intermediate 
organizations of various categories. We should accelerate the 
change of government functions and improve working efficiency. 
We should speed up the establishment of an income distribution 
system which takes the principle of "to each according to his 
work" as its mainstay, gives priority to efficiency while taking 
fairness into account; and we should improve the social security 
system. We should accelerate our participation in international 
economic cooperation and speed up the pace of necessary 
convergence with the international economy. While carrying out 
well these auxiliary reforms, we must formulate laws and 
regulations for governing the socialist market economy, and we 
must also handle well the relationship among reform, 
development, and stability and make the three coordinate with 
and promote one another. 
  The second point is that the special economic zones should 
maintain a fast and healthy economic development through 
deepening the reform and opening wider to the outside world. In 
order for them to do so, Jiang Zemin emphasized the necessity to 
do work well in the following respects: First, great efforts 
should be made to readjust the economic structure and develop 
more high-tech industries; this is an urgent task for special 
economic zones at present. In principle, the special economic 
zones and open coastal cities should no longer develop 
labor-intensive industries with low-levels of technology, such 
as processing supplied materials, processing materials according 
to samples provided, assembling provided parts, and engaging in 
compensatory trade. Such industries should be gradually moved 
to the interior regions; such a move will help the special 
economic zones and coastal regions accelerate the upgrading of 
their industrial structure, and it is conducive to the economic 
development of the interior regions, to reducing the blind flow 
of labor forces out of the interior regions, and to gradually 
narrowing inter-regional development gaps. The special economic 
zones should continue making great efforts to develop an export- 
oriented economy, and the key to success in this regard is to 
raise levels of technology and improve the product quality. We 
should strive to produce and export products of advanced 
technology and high-added value. Second, great efforts should 
be made to improve management. We must improve management in 
order to develop the economy. The management system should be 
comprehensive, the management work should be strict, and 
management standards should be raised. We should raise 
management standards in all fields -- economic, legal, 
administrative, and social management fields alike. It is 
inconceivable to engage in the modernization drive in the 
absence of modern management. The special economic zones should 
take the lead in performing and enforcing modern management. 
Third, a further step should be taken to improve the investment 
environment of the special economic zones. It should include 
both the "hard" environment -- a good infrastructure -- and the 
"soft" environment -- good working efficiency, service, 
legislation, and systems. Fourth, we should attach importance to 
and step up overall planning for the special economic zones. 
Only when we have a scientifically oriented general plan can we 
reduce blindness and losses in construction. 
  The third point is that the special economic zones should 
continue to introduce investment from abroad and establish 
lateral ties at home and make new contributions to promoting 
common development and common prosperity across the country. 
Jiang Zemin said: The special economic zones and the 
economically more developed coastal regions should persistently 
develop lateral ties with the interior regions, and they should 
make the most of their superior features, share out work, 
cooperate with one another, and take advantage of each other's 
strengths. This is extremely important for the development of a 
unified socialist market economy across the country, gradually 
narrowing the development gaps between the coastal regions and 
the interior regions, and achieving a common prosperity. I hope 
that the leading comrades in the special economic zones will 
constantly study how to strengthen economic and technological 
cooperation between the special economic zones and the interior 
regions and to support the development of poor interior regions; 
and this is something to the advantage of the economic 
development in the special economic zones and across the 
country, and it is well worth doing. 
  The fourth point is that the special economic zones, 
particularly the Shenzhen and Zhuhai Special Economic Zones, 
should make more contributions to our country's resumption of 
sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao and to its maintenance of 
long-term prosperity there. Jiang Zemin said: The broad masses 
of the compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao are patriotic, 
actively supporting the reunification of the motherland and 
willing to contribute to the modernization of the motherland. 
The more the Shenzhen and Zhuhai special economic zones develop 
socialist market economy, socialist democracy, and socialist 
spiritual civilization, the more they will play an important 
role in helping maintain long-term prosperity in Hong Kong and 
Macao. 
  The fifth point is that we should make great efforts to step 
up the building of socialist spiritual civilization in the 
special economic zones and improve the party's leadership over 
the work of the special economic zones. Jiang Zemin said: 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping particularly and unequivocally pointed 
out in his important talks made during his southern China 
inspection tour that a socialism with Chinese characteristics 
can be constructed only after both material and spiritual 
civilization are built well. We must have a profound 
understanding of this important idea of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, 
and conscientiously and persistently attach importance to both 
civilizations. We should see that the special economic zones 
and open coastal regions have achieved very rapid economic 
development and the situation of their material civilization has 
been gratifying in recent years. Relatively speaking, they 
still have many problems in the building of spiritual 
civilization, although they have made quite a few achievements 
in this regard. In particular, we must make great efforts to 
combat decadent behaviors and evils, such as disrupting public 
order, corrupting social values, and infringing upon the 
people's interests. We should take both stopgap measures and 
radical measures, and truly build both civilizations well. I 
hope that the special economic zones will not only march in the 
van in reform, opening up, and economic development, but also 
play a leading role in the building of spiritual civilization in 
China. Jiang Zemin also pointed out: We must know clearly that 
the additional advantages to be created for the special economic 
zones should include economic advantages, advantages in both 
material and spiritual civilization, ideological and political 
advantages, and the advantages of all-around social progress. 
For this reason, the special economic zones must make progress 
in building both civilizations. In appraising a leading cadre's 
job performance, we must assess not only his ability and 
achievements in building material civilization, but also his 
ability and achievements in building spiritual civilization. 
Under no circumstances should material civilization be 
developed at the expense of weakening or even sacrificing the 
building of spiritual civilization. Instead, the development of 
material civilization should help the development of spiritual 
civilization. We should satisfy the needs of the people's 
cultural life, while constantly providing a motive force and 
intellectual support for the development of material 
civilization. 
  Jiang Zemin stressed: As China deepens reform and 
opening up, establishes a socialist market economic structure, 
and advances the modernization drive, special economic zones 
should also correspondingly develop their characteristics. Some 
original preferential policies and measures practiced in special 
economic zones will naturally undergo changes, and it is 
necessary to develop new characteristics for special economic 
zones through creating and fully displaying their new strengths. 
Special economic zones should be "special." Jiang Zemin 
encouraged special economic zones and the broad masses of cadres 
and people throughout Guangdong Province to lift their spirits 
and to continue their efforts to complete various tasks even 
better. 
  General Secretary Jiang always has the production, lives, 
and 
well-being of the masses at heart. Because his inspection tour 
coincided with serious floods in some areas of Guangdong, he on 
many occasions inquired about the disaster situation, living 
arrangements for people in flood-affected areas, and the flood 
control and relief work and expressed his deep concern to people 
in those areas. The accident of the collapse of a textile 
factory building occurred during his inspection of Zhuhai, and 
he thus heard a briefing by the city party committee, ordered 
them to give treatment to the injured with all their strength, 
and he personally visited injured workers at the hospital. When 
he was informed that floods had also successively hit Guangxi, 
Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang, Comrade Jiang Zemin again 
gave important instructions. He asked principal leading cadres 
at all levels to swiftly go to the forefront of the 
disaster-stricken areas to organize and direct the people to 
carry out flood control and relief work. He demanded that 
flood-prone areas make preparations because preparedness averts 
peril. He also urged everybody to display the superiority of 
socialism and the fine tradition manifested that "whenever 
people in one part of the country are hard hit, their fellow 
countrymen in other parts of the country will come to their 
aid." He called for concerted efforts by the party, government, 
military, and the masses to strive for a victory in flood 
control and relief work. 
  During his inspection of Guangzhou, Comrade Jiang Zemin also 
went to the Guangzhou Military Region and heard a briefing by 
Commander Li Xilin and Political Commissar Shi Yuxiao. He 
encouraged comrades in the military region to intensify their 
studying, to do their jobs well, and to comprehensively improve 
the troops' quality and fighting capacity. He asked the broad 
masses of officers and men to display the work style of fearing 
no danger and fatigue and of conducting continuous struggles in 
current flood-fighting and relief work so as to make the maximum 
contribution to ensuring the security of the lives and property 
of the people and to rapidly restoring production and 
construction in the flood-stricken areas. 
  Those accompanying General Secretary Jiang Zemin in his 
inspection of Guangdong were Liao Hui, Zeng Peiyan, Hu Guangbao, 
Teng Wensheng, Yu Xiaosong, and other comrades in charge of 
relevant departments under the CPC Central Committee and the 
State Council.

  [Text] Guangzhou, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen stressed here that the 
country's coastal areas, particularly the Special Economic Zones 
[SEZs], should push their reform and opening up drive to an even 
higher level. 
  Qian, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), made these 
remarks when he was touring south China's Guangdong Province 
from June 17 to 22. 
  He said during his inspection that the coastal areas, 
particularly the special economic zones, which have been the 
country's pilot areas to carry out the policy of reform and 
opening to the outside world, have strong economic and 
technological forces and have accumulated rich experience in 
international trade, should now concentrate their efforts on 
developing high-tech industries and adopting high-level 
management. 
  Vice-Premier Qian visited Shenzhen and Zhuhai Special 
Economic Zones as well as Zhongshan and Foshan cities. He also 
inspected some ports, airports and tourist resorts. 
  After inspecting several ports linking the mainland of China 
with Hong Kong and Macao, Qian said that customs should be 
strict in making checks and pay attention to providing good 
facilities for trade and exchanges. 
  With the economic development, it was also necessary to 
promote ideological and ethical progress. 
  Vice-Premier Qian also inspected some dikes where local 
people and soldiers were fighting the floods. He conveyed 
regards to the flood fighters on behalf of the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council.

  [Text] Nanning, 22 Jun (XINHUA) -- Zou Jiahua, member of 
the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier, 21 
Jun arrived in Guangxi with a working group. In the past two 
days, he inspected flood-stricken areas in Wuzhou, Liuzhou, and 
other places. He expressed his greetings to military personnel 
and people who were busy in the first line of flood-fighting 
work. He made plans for flood prevention and disaster relief. 
Zou Jiahua also called on people in flood-stricken areas to 
foster faith and boost morale in a bid to overcome natural 
disasters and rebuild their homeland. 
  On 17 June, north, central, and northwest parts of Guangxi 
were hit by big floods. At 12:00 on 21 June, Vice Premier Zou 
Jiahua led a working group, which was formed by relevant leading 
comrades and experts of the State Planning Commission, the 
Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry of Internal Trade, the 
Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Public Health, and the 
General Political Department of the PLA, and flew to Nanning. 
On behalf of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and 
the Central Military Commission, Zou Jiahua went to see people 
living in Wuzhou, Liuzhou, and other places where floods had 
brought about severe damage. He expressed his greetings to 
officers and soldiers of the PLA and the armed police who were 
busy in the front line of the flood-fighting work. In the 
afternoon of 22 June, Zou Jiahua and his party braved the rain 
and took trucks to Wuliting area in Yufeng district of Liuzhou 
City where they inspected the flood situation. 
  After inspecting some places and hearing reports, Zou Jiahua 
said that he was satisfied with the previous flood-fighting work 
done by military personnel and people in Guangxi. He urged 
leading cadres at all levels to continue carrying forward the 
fine tradition of the party, form close ties with the people, 
and take the lead in fighting against floods. 
  Zou Jiahua emphatically said: The primary task at present is 
to solve the problem of providing food to people living in 
flood- stricken areas. Great effort should be made to resume 
transportation and ensure that enough grain will be transported 
to the flood-stricken areas in time. It is necessary to 
mobilize all the people to do well the work of public health and 
epidemic prevention. It is imperative to be on guard against 
the occurrence and spread of contagious diseases. 
  While planning for the flood-prevention, flood-fighting, and 
disaster-relief work in Guangxi, Zou Jiahua said: Flood season 
just began in South China. We should be mentally ready for a 
long-term fight against floods. Never shall we become careless. 
He urged leading cadres at all levels to foster a resolution 
and faith in overcoming natural disasters. He urged them to 
work hard, be self-dependent, and overcome present difficulties 
by relying on the force of the masses.

  [Text] Beijing, June 23 (AFP) -- China's official media 
played up Thursday relief efforts in six southern provinces hit 
by severe flooding, but continued to hide the high death toll in 
the disaster from the Chinese people. 
  The PEOPLE'S DAILY, the party mouthpiece, quoted Vice 
Premier 
Zou Jiahua, who is heading a central government task force to 
southwestern Guangxi, as expressing his satisfaction with relief 
efforts after touring badly hit areas for two days. 
  According to a ministry of civil affairs statement released 
to foreign news organisations Wednesday, 719 people have died in 
two weeks of severe flooding that has caused economic losses of 
some 30.54 billion yuan (3.51 billion dollars) in the six 
provinces. 
  Central Hunan has been worst hit with 190 fatalities, while 
174 people have died in southern Guangdong, 141 in southwestern 
Guangxi, 80 in southeasten Fujian, 68 in eastern Zhejiang and 66 
in southeastern Jiangxi as of Wednesday, according to the 
ministry's figures. 
  In a similar statement revealing the extent of the disaster 
earlier in the week, the ministry appealed for foreign aid for 
relief efforts. 
  Chinese citizens, meanwhile, have been given few details of 
casualties and economic losses, fed instead a daily diet of 
propaganda extolling local governments' commitment to helping 
local residents and the heroism of People's Liberation Army 
soldiers on the front line of relief work. 
  Zhou was quoted as saying the main tasks were ensuring food 
supplies for local people, stepping up efforts to restore 
transport links and carrying out effective disease prevention 
work to stop the outbreak of any epidemics. 
  "Southern China's flood season has only just begun, we must 
prepare with a long-term flood prevention attitude and by no 
means treat the matter lightly," the PEOPLE'S DAILY quoted Zhou 
as saying. 
  The central government had as of Wednesday released six 
million yuan in relief aid, divided equally between Guangdong, 
Guangxi and Hunan. 
  The paper said that in Fujian there had been "severe losses 
in human life and property," but gave no precise details. 
  Local officials were again quoted as stressing their 
courageous efforts at bringing relief to citizens, saying 
special funds had been released and eight task forces dispatched. 
  Some 10,000 soldiers, police and local paramilitary officers 
and 3,000 vehicles are taking part in the relief work, it said.

  [Text] A joint central work team led by State Councillor 
Chen Junsheng arrived at the provincial flood control 
headquarters based near the Bei Jiang Dam to express his 
sympathy and concern for the cadres, masses, as well as People's 
Liberation Army officers and soldiers combating the flood on the 
front lines. The joint central work team relayed instructions 
issued in Beijing by Premier Li Peng with regard to the flood 
prevention and disaster relief work underway in some southern 
China provinces and cities. 
  Provincial leaders, including [Governor] Zhu Senlin and Ou 
Guangyuan, reported to the joint central work team on 
Guangdong's flood prevention and disaster relief work. The 
joint central work team and the provincial leaders then went to 
Qingyuan to inspect the flood prevention work. Comrade Chen 
Junsheng spoke highly of the province's flood prevention and 
disaster relief work and gave the following instructions: 1) 
never slacken the flood prevention efforts; 2) to be ready to 
combat more severe floods and natural disasters; 3) to reinforce 
dikes and dams and clear away silt; 4) to provide afflicted 
areas with disaster relief and organize local people to resume 
production and rebuild home towns; 5) to repair damaged 
installations and facilities; 6) to take precautions against 
possible epidemic diseases caused by the flooding.

  [Text] Beijing, June 23 (XINHUA) -- The Ministry of 
Agriculture has allocated 65,600 tons of chemical fertilizer and 
20,000 tons of fuel for farm machinery to flooded areas in 
southern China as part of its efforts to help them recover from 
the disaster, sources from the ministry said here today. 
  About 3.86 million ha of crops had been hit by the 
disastrous 
floods since early June, with south China's Guangdong Province 
the worst affected. 
  The ministry said that about 660,000 ha of crops in 
Guangdong 
province, one of the richest regions in China, was affected by 
the floods. 
  Guangdong Province was followed by the provinces of Jiangxi 
and Hunan, with 600,000 ha of flooded crops. 
  The other provinces were east China's Zhejiang, Anhui and 
Fujian, and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. 
  While the southern part of China has been hit by rainstorms 
and floods, about 19 million ha of crop in nearly ten provinces 
or regions in the northern China are suffering from continuous 
drought, an increase of about 11.1 million ha over last month. 
  About 17.6 million people and 27.81 million head of 
livestock 
have problems with drinking water because of the prolonged dry 
spells, the minister said. 
  The drought-hit regions include the provinces of Shandong, 
Hebei and Shanxi and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. 
  The ministry is also offering the disaster-hit regions 
advices on how to minimize the effects on agricultural 
production, such as growing more crops that needs shorter growth 
period in the flooded southern regions and more acreage for late 
rice in double-cropping rice regions. 
  Moreover, the flooded areas should pay more attention to 
possible droughts which often come after floods, and worsening 
plant diseases, particularly the prevention and control of 
diseases affecting rice, cotton, corn and soybeans, the ministry 
cautioned.

  [Text] Beijing, June 22 (CNS) -- The Minister of Public 
Security, Mr. Tao Siju, said today that resolute measures would 
be continuously taken in China's anti-drug trafficking work this 
year and in the coming years to prevent drugs from flowing into 
China. 
  Speaking at a meeting held by the state anti-drug 
trafficking 
committee, Mr. Tao said despite of notable achievements made in 
the country's anti-drug trafficking campaign since last year, 
situation of drug-related crimes remained serious due to effects 
of the worldwide drug-related crimes. The anti-drug trafficking 
campaign was arduous with drug trafficking activities rampant in 
the frontier area of the southwest China and existence of 
illegal planting of opium poppies. Therefore, the campaign 
should not slack off. 
  Mr. Tao said top priority would be given to the frontier 
area 
of the southwest China such as Yunnan Province and Guangxi 
Province in terms of crackdown of border drug trafficking. 
These two provinces should intensify their anti-drug 
trafficking campaigns in order to prevent drugs made outside 
China from passing through the territory of China.

  [Text] Beijing, June 23 (CNS) -- The security business has 
become one of the new rising professions in China following 
nearly ten years' exploitation. It can help to some extent 
alleviate the tense state involving long term inadequacy of the 
police force. 
  The profession dated back to 1985 when Shenzhen took the 
lead 
in setting up a security service company, the first of its kind 
in China, according to sources from the public security 
department. Other places followed suit since then and there were 
more than 1,000 security companies across the country with 
employment of 200,000 as of late last year. 
  The security profession is regarded as an auxiliary force to 
help the police prevent crime and safeguard social order, 
according to relevant regulations. Security workers comprise 
demobilized military men, unemployed young persons from urban 
areas and young persons from rural areas. 
  The security business, which offers service at certain 
charges, has developed into new groups to defend social order. 
The Beijing Security Service Company, for example, is now 
providing service for 2,278 entities, including foreign 
diplomatic missions stationed in China, apartment buildings for 
diplomats, foreign-funded enterprises and domestic industrial 
enterprises. 
  Most security companies just offer gate-keeping service at 
present. The level of service available as well as the quality 
of service and employees urgently need to be improved. A 
security association is said to be established in the near 
future in a bid to boost professional guidance and 
administration of the security business.

<F P=106> [By Chan Wai-Fong in Shenzhen] </F>
  [Text] Ousted Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang has been 
given unexpected prominence in a photographic exhibition on tour 
in Guangdong. The former party general-secretary, 74, appeared 
in at least five photos among the 520 shown in the Deng Xiaoping 
Photograph Exhibition which opened in Shenzhen yesterday. 
  One well-displayed picture showed him working side-by-side 
with patriarch Deng Xiaoping and the late party chief Hu Yaobang 
in the 1980's when Mr Deng's theory of "socialism with Chinese 
characteristics" was put forward. 
  There were also pictures of Mr Zhao on historical occasions, 
like the signing of the Sino-British and Sino-Portuguese Joint 
Declarations, in which Mr Deng also participated. 
  Photos of Mr Zhao, Mr Hu and other controversial figures in 
the Communist Party's political movements, like Gao Gan amazed 
the thousands who flocked to the Shenzhen Exhibition Hall at the 
start of the week-long show. Zou Qiyu, director of the 
Information Office of the Guangdong Provincial Government, said 
that to respect history and to be loyal to facts was one of the 
guiding principles of the exhibition. "Many of the historical 
personalities appear in the way history has taken place," Mr Zou 
said. 
  Analysts in Guangdong said Mr Zhao, a former party boss of 
the province, still had a large following there. Perhaps 
mindful of this the leadership has repeatedly denied requests by 
Mr Zhao, now re-located to Chengdu, Sichuan Province, to visit 
the province, 
  Many of the old comrades-in-arms who fought alongside Mr 
Deng 
during the liberation warfare and during the 1950's were given 
pride of place, dwarfing the current powers-that-be. 
  While a number of relatively liberal politicians, such as 
former president Yang Shangkun, were shown in central positions 
in a number of pictures, Premier Li Peng appeared only once, 
among party leaders in a group photo taken about two years ago. 
  Mr Zou said about 40 per cent of the pictures had not been 
published before. Most of these were taken on Mr Deng's visits 
to Guangdong in the past decade and particularly in early 1992. 
  Co-organised by Shenzhen and the Guangdong Provincial 
Government and party committees, the exhibition is understood to 
be the largest of its kind about the patriarch. 
  Apart from Mr Deng's life-long involvement with China and 
the 
Chinese Communist Party, a large section is devoted to Mr Deng 
in Guangdong. There is a special section on him as a humorous 
and active private citizen who enjoys life, particularly family 
life. 
  Mr Zou dismissed claims that the show would help boost Mr 
Deng's personality cult, which the elderly leader has repeatedly 
denounced. "We only want to help people understand and 
comprehend better comrade Deng's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and to promote the learning of 
Deng's Selected Works," he said. He added that "responsible 
departments" in Beijing had given their approval. 
  Tang Yongbin, a Shenzhen worker, said the exhibition was 
significant now that economic reform "had reached a rather 
critical stage." He did not think the show would promote Mr 
Deng's personality cult. 
  Another visitor said the exhibition was only to commemorate 
Mr Deng's visit to Shenzhen and Guangdong. "Many of the 
pictures taken during his visit then had not been shown before. 
But now there is little disagreement over the introduction of 
market economy the showing of these pictures carries no 
particular significance," he said. 
  After touring the province, the exhibition will travel to 
Hong Kong and other cities in the West.

  [Text] Beijing, 21 Jun (XINHUA) -- To ensure the sound 
development of the satellite ground reception equipment 
industry, China will designate producers of ground reception 
equipment for satellite television broadcasting and implement a 
strict production licensing system. 
  It was learned that China's satellite television industry 
developed rapidly in the last decade. The country today has 
nearly 300 enterprises producing more than 100,000 sets of 
satellite television reception equipment a year. These 
enterprises, which are under the jurisdiction of more than 10 
departments, spread thinly their production investment and are 
generally small in terms of their scale of production. Many of 
them lack the ability to develop products by themselves and 
demonstrate poor economic efficiency. To change this condition, 
the State Council has decided to strengthen the macromanagement 
of the production of satellite ground reception equipment. 
Based on this decision, the Ministry of Electronics Industry 
recently promulgated the "Provisions on the Management of Ground 
Receiving Equipment for Satellite Television Broadcasting." 
  The provisions specify that local departments in charge of 
the electronics industry will be centrally responsible for 
managing the production of satellite ground reception equipment, 
for receiving applications, for making recommendations related 
to the designation of enterprises for the production of 
satellite ground reception equipment in the localities, and for 
investigating unlicensed production. 
  The provisions stipulate that an enterprise must possess 
certain conditions to become a designated production enterprise: 
An enterprise must has the ability to develop new products, and 
its products must contain a higher proportion of locally made 
components. Its production scale must be fairly large, and its 
products must enjoy a fairly large market share. It must have 
the means to measure satellite ground reception equipment 
qualities and possess a sound and effective system for quality 
control. Its products must reach the current national or 
industrial standards. It must have a complete set of documents 
on the design and industrial process of the products as required 
by state regulations. 
  The provisions also set specific requirements on the methods 
of application, examination, and approval for designated 
production enterprises and on the operation and management of 
licensed enterprises. The provisions also stipulate that 
unlicensed enterprises must immediately stop producing satellite 
ground reception equipment and that unlicensed producers will be 
investigated to fix their responsibility as legal entities in 
accordance with the law.

  [Text] Fuzhou, June 22 (CNS) -- Flood lasting for ten or 
more days in Fujian Province has brought about heavy losses in 
agriculture there. According to the latest information offered 
by the Provincial Agricultural Bureau, a total area of 2.465 
million mu of crops have been hit by the flood and of which, 446 
000 mu of crops will have no yield, 1.957 million mu of grain 
have been heavily hit and some 300 million kilogram grain are 
expected to be lost. 
  Among nine cities and prefectures in Fujian, those seriously 
hit by the flood are Sanming, Nanping, Ningde, Fuzhou, Quanzhou 
and Putian. Of these, Sanming City is worst hit by the flood. 
In May, the city was hit by the heavy rainstorm and had big 
losses and now it suffers again from the flood with some 600 000 
mu of crops damaged by flood and 200 million kilogram grain 
expected to be lost. 
  Per capita possession of cultivated land in Fujian is only 
0.05 mu. Even if in the normal years, grain output there is not 
self- sufficient. The consecutive flood has made agricultural 
production situation there more grim. Disaster-relief groups 
have been sent to the flood-stricken areas striving for 
minimizing losses.

  [Text] At a provincial anticorruption report meeting that 
ended yesterday [19 June], provincial party Secretary Jia 
Qinglin stressed: Party committees and governments at all 
levels must maintain our leadership style as main party and 
government leaders who grasp anticorruption work in person. 
They must increase their sense of responsibility and urgency in 
deepening the three kinds of work in the anticorruption struggle. 
  Comrade Jia Qinglin fully affirmed the achievements in the 
anticorruption struggle in our province since the three plenary 
meetings of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission. In 
the meantime, he also pointed out: At present, there remain 
problems of failing to firmly grasp the work of investigating 
and handling major and important cases, and of unhealthy trends 
gaining ground. Governments and relevant departments at all 
levels must pay close attention to this matter. 
  He emphasized: It is necessary to further unify our 
understanding so as to increase our consciousness of doing two 
types of work simultaneously, and attaching equal importance to 
both. Proceeding from the overall situation of maintaining a 
lengthy and peaceful reign in our country, we must be firm and 
unshakable in carrying out our anticorruption struggle in a 
deepgoing, solid, and more effective way. We must increase the 
weight of investigating and handling major and important cases, 
with the focus on cases involving corruption, graft, fraud, 
smuggling, and severe violation of financial and economic 
discipline. [passage indistinct] 
  Comrade Lin Zhaoshu put forward specific demands for the 
work 
arrangements in the next stage of our anticorruption struggle. 
He pointed out: It is necessary to continue grasping the work 
of maintaining leading cadres' cleanliness, honesty, and self- 
discipline, and of correcting unhealthy trends. It is necessary 
to continue exercising control over revenues and expenditures to 
solve the problem of unhealthy trends at its root. It is 
necessary to strengthen supervision and examination work. 
[passage indistinct]. 
  Leaders of the provincial court, procuratorate, and public 
security bureau also spoke at the meeting.

  [Text] The State Ministry of Communications and the 
provincial government held an on-the-spot meeting on the 
Zhangzhou Economic Development Zone, which was developed by the 
Chinese Merchants Steamship and Navigation Company and the Bank 
of China, in Zhangzhou on 14 June to study the issue of 
accelerating the construction of the zone. The meeting 
stressed: Governments at all levels and various departments 
must further understand the great significance of accelerating 
the construction of the zone from the height of realizing the 
reunification of the motherland, must make concerted efforts to 
do a good job of port construction, and must actively create the 
optimal conditions for the opening of the three exchanges. 
  Communications Minister Huang Zhendong and Provincial Party 
Secretary Jia Qinglin listened to the reports submitted by the 
leaders of Zhangzhou City and the Zhangzhou Economic Development 
Zone and made important speeches. 
  Since the Zhangzhou Economic Development Zone, which 
earmarks 
an area of 18 square km for development, has been under 
construction since the beginning of last year, great progress 
has been made in the various fields of work, thus attracting the 
attention of people at home and abroad. 
  When discussing the need to fully understand the 
significance 
of accelerating the zone's construction, Huang Zendong stressed: 
Fujian will be the first to bear the brunt of opening direct air 
and shipping services between the two sides of the strait. 
Efforts should be made to speed up port construction to 
facilitate the commencement of shipping services. It is 
imperative to accelerate the construction of the Zhangzhou 
Economic Development Zone. 
  Jia Qinglin fully affirmed the achievements already made by 
Zhangzhou Economic Development Zone. He pointed out: The zone 
has been set up in Fujian, Zhangzhou, Longhai, and Gangwei, and 
these areas will be the first to benefit. We should support the 
zone's construction with concrete action. He stressed: Not 
only will the construction of the zone spur Zhangzhou's economic 
development but it will also play a mutually complementary role 
in the development of the Xiamen Special Economic Zone. More 
importantly, we should focus on the development of exchanges 
between the two sides of the strait and serve and submit to the 
overall situation of peaceful reunification and the concept of 
one country, two systems. We should approach the great 
significance of the construction of the development zone in this 
sense. 
  The meeting studied the issues of port construction, land 
acquisition, deep-water facilities and the corresponding support 
roads on land, funds, a 35,000-tonne-class multipurpose wharf, 
the zone's preferential policy after the introduction of 
taxation system reform, and the zone's gateway to the outside 
world. The participants achieved unity in understanding and 
adopted a resolution.

  [Text] Nanchang, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Jiujiang, an eastern 
Chinese city with an excellent harbor on the Chang Jiang river, 
has accelerated its infrastructure construction to provide 
better conditions for overseas investment. 
  According to an official from the city, the central 
government and Jiangxi Province are spending over three billion 
yuan on 20 key construction projects in Jiujiang during the 
Seventh Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995). 
  Opened to foreign ships in 1992, Jiujiang harbor has regular 
cargo shipping services to various parts of the world. Its 
airport links the city with Beijing, Nanjing and Huiyang in 
Guangdong Province. New air routes are being planned with 
regular flights to Shanghai, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and 
Haikou. 
  A major bridge across the Chang Jiang river is being built 
in 
the city. Railway lines from Beijing to Kowloon, from Shanghai 
to Chongqing, and from Jiujiang to Hefei, which are all under 
construction, will make the city an important transportation 
center. 
  With a favorable investment environment and promising 
potential, the city approved 144 foreign investment projects 
during last year alone, with an investment of 140 million U.S. 
dollars. 
  To further improve its investment conditions, the city plans 
to invest a total of 10 billion yuan by the end of the century 
in such sectors as communications, telecommunications and energy.

  [Text] Nanchang, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Arable land protection 
areas, to ensure the success of intensive farming, stable output 
and freedom from drought and waterlogging, have been set up in 
Jiangxi province. 
  The per capita arable land in this major grain-producing 
region averages 0.97 mu (one mu equals 0.065 ha) in Jiangxi. 
And the figure is decreasing along with industrialization, 
urbanization and population growth. The shortage of arable land 
is becoming an increasing obstacle to the development of 
agriculture and the economy as a whole. 
  Land in the protection areas can only be used for planting, 
and no house building, soil removal or brick making are allowed. 
Also banned are the digging of fish-raising pools or graves and 
tree planting. 
  With the setting up of arable land protection areas farmers 
no longer worry about their land being "confiscated". This 
gives them confidence to throw themselves wholeheartedly into 
farming.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporters Chang Chiao (1728 </F>
3390), Yeh Hung-yen (2814 4767 3601): "Three Million People in 
Guangdong Hit by Floods"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 21 Jun (TA KUNG PAO) -- Large areas in 
Guangdong have been hit by floods and the losses are heavy. 
Because various localities have been busy with rescue and 
relief work, they have had no time to prepare detailed 
statistics on losses. The Guangdong Headquarters for Prevention 
of Three Kinds of Natural Disasters has sent a "report on the 
struggle against floods, efforts to deal with the emergency, and 
the state of the disasters in the Xi Jiang and Bei Jiang." This 
reveals that according to incomplete statistics from the four 
cities of Shaoguan, Qingyuan, Zhaoqing, and Zhongshan, 29 
counties and cities have been hit by floods, and 3.177 million 
people have been affected. Of these, 740,000 are surrounded by 
floodwaters, 300,000 in Shaoguan City, 340,000 in Qingyuan City, 
and 100,000 in Zhaoqing City. Some 280,000 houses have been 
ruined, 37,000 houses have collapsed, 101 people have died, 49 
people are missing, 147,000 hectares of farmland have been hit, 
and a number of medium and small irrigation projects have been 
seriously damaged. 
  The situation revealed by the flood disaster this time shows 
that most of the embankments which defend small areas and which 
have low fortification standards have collapsed. For example, 
31 embankments in Qingyuan City have collapsed. Of these 
embankments, four were protecting a 10,000 mu or larger area of 
land; in Zhaoqing City, 99 embankments each protecting an area 
of less than 10,000 mu of land, have collapsed, and five 
embankments each protecting an area of 1,000-10,000 mu, have 
water running over them, and gates have to be lifted to let 
water pass through in order to protect them. The seats of 
counties and towns along the rivers and coast have been 
seriously inundated--a total of 13 county seats have been 
inundated. For example, Yangshan County is four meters under 
water, whereas in the counties of Fengkai, Yunan, Yingde, and 
Lechang, water has risen to the second floor. More than 70,000 
people in Yingde City are now relying on biscuits, mineral 
water, and medicine dropped to them from helicopters. 
  According to information, during the floods this time, 
torrents of water rushed down the mountains and landslides 
occurred, blocking many roads. For example, State Expressway 
107 was not through north of Yangshan and the main roads and 
bridges in Liannan and Lianshan have been blocked by mud from 
landslides. Meanwhile, houses have collapsed as a result of 
landslide, for example, at Sanzhou Management Zone in Liannan 
County's Damai Hill, 33 people died when their houses collapsed. 
Power transmission lines and irrigation facilities have also 
been damaged by landslides. In Yangshan County's Chakeng 
Reservoir, a moderate landslide and the collapse of a wall along 
the spillway have blocked the water tunnel with rocks and mud 
but the situation has been promptly handled and the reservoir 
has been rendered safe.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Guangdong Utilizes Over $4 Billion of </F>
Foreign Capital in the First Five Months of This Year"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 12 Jun (TA KUNG PAO) -- Guangdong 
Province has utilized almost $4.1 billion of foreign capital 
over the first five months of this year, an increase of 40 
percent over the same period last year. Guangzhou, Huizhou, 
Zhanjiang, Shantou, Zhaoqing, and Jieyang Cities have registered 
an increase of more than 50 percent. The exports of 
foreign-invested enterprises throughout the province have 
amounted to $1.9 billion. Foreign businessmen have actually 
invested almost $3.5 billion, or 80 percent of the foreign 
capital utilized by the province. During this period, more than 
1,100 contracts have been signed with wholly owned 
foreign-invested enterprises, each contract comprising $2.48 
million in foreign capital. 
  According to statistics provided by the Guangdong Provincial 
Economic Commission, investment in tertiary industries has 
continued to rise, but investment in the real estate business 
has been slowing down. In the first quarter, 597 of the newly 
approved three type foreign-invested enterprises engaged in 
tertiary industrial production, and percentage went up from 1 to 
2 percent as compared with the same period last year. The real 
estate business began to slow down following the rapid 
development of the last two years. From January to March, there 
were 159 newly approved projects throughout the province, a 
decrease of 28 percent compared with the same period last year. 
  In the first quarter, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan 
investments accounted for 94 percent, a decrease of 1.5 percent 
compared with the same period last year. In the newly approved 
enterprises during the same quarter, there were 19 British 
enterprises, 62 U.S. enterprises, and three French enterprises, 
an increase of more than 50 percent over the same period last 
year. Regarding foreign capital actually utilized, Thai capital 
increased by almost 50 percent, Australian capital went up 85 
times, and U.S. capital 15 times. 
  The Guangdong Provincial Government has proposed a basic 
idea 
on the utilization of foreign capital in the future. 
  First, aiming at the basic realization of modernization in 
20 
years and utilizing foreign capital in a multidirectional 
manner, Guangdong will strive to utilize foreign capital of $190 
billion in the coming 20 years. Primary, secondary, and 
tertiary industries will be opened to foreign capital, except 
some special undertakings prescribed by the state. With the 
exception of basic industries and monopolized undertakings with 
state controlled stocks, foreign investors are welcome to wholly 
operate other undertakings and projects or to control the larger 
parts of their stocks. 
  Second, Guangdong will use the industrial policy to guide 
investment orientation, so as to change the previous practice of 
orientating policies to certain regions. By implementing a 
preferential industrial policy, it will gradually switch the 
foreign investment focus from processing industries to 
infrastructure construction, basic industries, tertiary 
industries, and hi-tech industries. 
  Third, the province will improve the results of foreign 
capital utilization by strengthening management. Under the 
conditions of a socialist market economy, it will establish a 
mechanism by which the government can exercise macromanagement 
over all enterprises, including foreign-invested firms. 
Guangdong will formulate the relevant laws and regulations to 
deal with the increasing disputes in three type foreign-invested 
enterprises and to protect the legitimate rights and interests 
of both management and labor. 
  Apart from this, as renminbi is currently in relatively 
short 
supply, foreign investors will be allowed to control large 
portions of stock through direct investments. In addition, 
Guangdong will fully use the internationally practiced BOT 
[build-operate-transfer] method, investments by international 
financial firms, and investments by loan foundations. 
  Viewing the new developments in foreign capital utilization, 
Guangdong will integrate the use of foreign capital with pillar 
industries. It will focus its efforts on developing energy, 
transportation, and telecommunications facilities as well as 
ethylene, automobile, electronics, textile, clothing, and 
pharmaceutical industries. Moreover, it will encourage the use 
of foreign capital in hi-tech industrial development, the high- 
supplementary-value export processing industry, and foreign- 
exchange-creating agriculture. Foreign capital will be 
introduced in banking and retail businesses on a trial basis for 
gradual popularization. In real estate, foreign capital will be 
primarily used for industrial land development, the renovation 
of old houses, and the construction of ordinary apartments. In 
mountainous or slowly developing regions, foreign capital may be 
transferred in an echelon formation; for the present, foreign 
capital can still be used for labor-intensive industrial 
development.

  [Text] A central work team headed by State Council Vice 
Premier Zou Jiahua, responsible for providing disaster relief to 
Guangxi, arrived in Nanning at noon by special plane today. 
Accompanied by autonomous regional Governor Cheng Kejie and 
other leaders, the work team rushed to Wuzhou and other places 
by helicopter to inspect the disaster situation and to guide the 
work of combating floods and providing disaster relief. 
  Leaders with Vice Premier Zou Jiahua included Chen Yaobang, 
vice minister of the State Planning Commission, He Jihai, vice 
minister of the Internal Trade Ministry, Li Jiaolin, deputy 
director of the Grain Reserve Department, Xu Caihou, deputy 
director of the General Political Department under the People's 
Liberation Army [PLA], and others. 
  Autonomous regional party, government, and military leaders 
who welcomed Vice Premier Zou Jiahua and his party at Nanning's 
Wuxi Airport included Cheng Kejie, Liu Mingzu, Xu Bingsong, Mao 
Hubin, and others. 
  Zhao Fulin, Guangxi Autonomous Regional CPC secretary, Wen 
Guoqing, Guangxi Military District commander, Liu Chunliang, 
political commissar of the air force stationed in Guangxi, and 
others rushed to Guiping and Pingnan, one of the areas severely 
affected by floods in our region, to inspect the disaster 
situation, and guide the work of fighting floods and providing 
disaster relief. On behalf of the regional CPC committee, 
regional people's government, Guangxi Military District, and PLA 
troops stationed in Guangxi, they visited and expressed their 
thanks to all servicemen and civilian who participated in the 
drive to fight floods and provide disaster relief. 
  On the afternoon of 20 June, after arriving in Guiping, Zhao 
Fulin and his party took a boat to go downstream on the Yu Jiang 
to Jiangkou Town, a severely flooded area. When the boat 
arrived at the town, Zhao Fulin visited more than 700 officers 
and men of the Tashan Heroic Regiment, who were fighting the 
floods there. When he learned that these more than 700 fighters 
and officers had risked their lives and sweat to erect a 14-km 
flood-control dyke using 100,000 pieces of gunnysacks. He was 
very excited and said: You ventured to keep off the floods with 
your bodies to protect the lives and property of the people. 
You have proven to be the People's Army and heroic troops. 
  In Pingnan County town where the water level was as high as 
over three meters, while inspecting those drowned streets and 
houses, Zhao Fulin asked local leaders about the floods. He 
wanted to know the situation regarding safety, food supplies, 
lodging, health, and other concerns of the masses affected by 
the disaster. When he learned that the county had succeeded in 
processing 300,000 kg of paddy into rice and that each and every 
victim of floods would first get five kg of rice to ensure that 
they would not go hungry, Zhao Fulin felt very happy. He 
stressed: The present priority task is to rescue those of the 
masses who are stranded on rooftops and hilltops as soon as 
possible. We must clearly examine each and every village, 
rooftop, and tree. We must rescue them as early as possible. 
Those who lack grain must be provided with relief grain. Our 
relief work must reflect that the party shows concern for the 
masses and that our party and government leaders have strong 
organization capability. It must also show the strength of 
army- civilian unity and team spirit under the leadership of the 
CPC. 
  In Pingnan County town, Zhao Fulin also took a small boat to 
visit victims stranded on rooftops. He asked after their health 
with deep concern and said a few words to comfort them. When 
the masses witnessed the deep concern shown to them by the 
regional party, government, and military leaders, they were 
greatly moved. 
  After inspecting the flood situation in the two counties and 
cities, Secretary Zhao discussed on the boat with Yulin 
prefectural, county, and city leaders disaster-relief plans. He 
uttered sincere words and expressed earnest hopes. When he 
learned that county and city party secretaries in Yulin City, 
Beiliu City, and Hongxian County, which were not affected by 
floods, had each led 1,000-man rescue teams consisting of young 
people's militiamen who could swim well to provide disaster 
relief, he praised them by saying: Such team spirit is very 
good. The foods are merciless but the men are full of sympathy. 
Party and government leaders at all levels must tell the broad 
masses of people affected by floods that the government and 
areas which have not been affected by the disaster will 
definitely come to their rescue. As long as there is the 
leadership of the Communist Party, difficulties can be overcome 
no matter how enormous they are.

  [Text] Provincial party committee Secretary Li Changchun 
invited persons in charge of a number of loss-making state-run 
enterprises to a meeting convened in Luoyang on 13 June to 
discuss and map out ways and means of turning enterprise losses 
into profits. 
  Secretary Li Changchun delivered a speech in which he 
emphatically called for firmly grasping each and every excellent 
opportunity at the moment, further emancipating our minds, 
deepening the on-going enterprise reform, and boldly trying out 
a variety of new reform measures. He stated: We should 
strictly implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee by further developing the 
productive forces; promoting lateral associations between 
enterprises; forming more enterprise groups; correctly handling 
relations between reform and development, on the one hand, and 
stability on the other; carrying out production in light of 
market demand; producing more readily marketable products; 
shifting enterprise operational mechanisms; focusing on heavy 
industrial growth, while continually pushing ahead with light 
and textile industrial growth; and amalgamating more loss-making 
enterprises with profit-making enterprises, with a view to 
turning enterprise losses into profits. To this end, he said, 
all comrades concerned should further enhance a sense of 
enterprise reform and should strive to accelerate the on-going 
enterprise reform. 
  Secretary Li Changchun noted: The large and medium-sized 
state- run enterprises also should implement a joint-stock 
cooperative system on a trial basis, further expand opening up 
to the outside world, and firmly grasp two key work aspects at 
the same time.

  [Text] Wuhan, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Central China's Hubei 
Province will build a new billion yuan, 160 km railway linking 
it to the Three Gorges area, where China's largest water control 
dam will be located. 
  According to local officials, the new railway line will 
start 
from Yingcheng city in eastern Hubei and join the existing 
Jiaozuo railway line at Jingzhou city, also in Hubei, via the 
province's Tianmen and Zhongxiang cities and Jingshan County, 
and extend to Yichang city, which is quite close to the huge 
projected dam. 
  The new railway line will have a capacity to carry more than 
20 million tons per year. 
  Construction of the line will begin during the next 
five-year- plan period (1996-2000) and the whole project will be 
completed within three years. 
  Foreign funds, such as foreign governmental loans and 
investment from transnational consortiums, will be used besides 
locally-raised funds to pay for the new line. 
  Engineers say that it will help shorten the travelling 
distance between Wuhan, the province's capital, and Yichang by 
240 km, compared with the existing Handan and Jiaozhi railway 
lines. 
  The officials added that the new line would be of great 
importance for improving the comprehensive transport system in 
central China, promoting economic development along the Chang 
Jiang river, and helping the construction of the Three Gorges 
Dam.

areas; 118 cities and towns were submerged; 115,000 houses were 
destroyed, and approximately 50,000 houses collapsed. The 
flooding has left 120 people dead and has caused more than 2 
billion yuan in direct economic losses. It has also inflicted 
losses on approximately 914,000 mu of crops, has destroyed 
510,000 mu of cultivated land, has forced 4,100 industrial and 
mining enterprises to suspend production or to operate at a 
reduced capacity, has damaged over 600 km of embankments, has 
burst at least 14,000 small reservoirs and 12,000 km of 
irrigation ditches, and has caused approximately 350 million 
yuan in direct economic losses to water conservancy facilities.

  Wang Keying urged the judicial and public security organs at 
all levels to maintain stability in public order. 
  In conclusion, Provincial Party Secretary Wang Maolin 
delivered an important speech. He said: On the whole, the 
current flood fighting and relief tasks have been completed 
satisfactorily. The People's Liberation Army in particular has 
played a unique role. We should bring the positive role of the 
working class and the broad masses of people into full play.

  [Text] Comrade Wen Jiabao [member of CPC Central Committee 
Secretariat] and his party left Changsha for Zhuzhou and 
Xiangtan yesterday. He inspected the flooded areas, including 
Zhuzhou City's Xiawan dike, the Hexi New and High Technology 
Development Zone, and Linghuayuan and Xiangtan's Yangtianhu, 
Xingxiadi, Zhoujiangdi, and Shiwandalou, where rescue and relief 
work was in full swing. After listening to reports submitted by 
the two cities on their efforts to fight the flooding and do 
relief work, he issued important instructions. 
  Comrade Wen Jiabao fully affirmed the initial victories that 
the two cities have scored in their flood fighting and relief 
work under the leadership of the provincial party committee and 
government. He said: In fighting floods and doing relief work, 
the broad masses of cadres and people in Zhuzhou and Xiangtan 
sacrificed their interests to rescue a large number of 
industrial and mining enterprises, the Beijing-Guangzhou 
Railway, the 107 National Highway, and cities and thus minimized 
the losses caused by floods. This fully shows that, with party 
leadership and the socialist system, we will be able to overcome 
all difficulties. Regarding the work in the next stage, he 
pointed out: We should continue to take flood fighting and 
relief tasks as the focus of our current work and simultaneously 
do a good job of reform, opening up to the outside world, 
stability, other fields of work, and industrial and agricultural 
production. He said: After the water recedes, we should firmly 
grasp the opportunity and repair the damaged dikes and 
embankments. As the highest flood season has not yet arrived, 
we should be prepared at any time to meet new flood peaks 
head-on rather than slacken our efforts. We should try every 
possible means to provide food, clothing, and shelter to flood 
victims, pay special attention to preventing and curing 
diseases, and concentrate efforts on the resumption of 
production and the reconstruction of homes. He particularly 
stressed: The current flooding has revealed problems in the 
construction of water conservancy facilities and urban flood 
control. In the past, inadequate consideration has been given 
to urban flood control and the coordination of urban and rural 
flood control. In the next step, we should earnestly draw a 
lesson from this negative experience. 
  Governor Chen Bangzhu urged the party committees and 
governments of Zhuzhou and Xiangtan to convey Comrade Wen 
Jiabao's regards and instructions on behalf of the party Central 
Committee and the State Council for the broad masses of cadres 
and people to the party committees and governments at all levels 
as soon as possible, earnestly implement them, and effectively 
carry out the work of fighting floods, doing relief work, and 
helping oneself by engaging in production.

  Some 560,000 Armymen and residents have worked days and 
nights to combat the floods for almost a week. 
  The Changsha city government and the city committee of the 
Communist Party of China have now begun to organize manpower to 
help resume production, while continuing operations to fight any 
further possible floods.

the Changsha monitoring station was 38.93 m [meters], some 3.93 
m above danger level. 
  One hundred and eighteen towns of eight prefectures and 
cities along the Xiangjiang River were flooded. 
  Flood water also entered some 20 streets and lanes of 
Changsha, more than 300,000 city dwellers were affected. Over

  [Text] On 17 June, while carrying out an inspection tour 
in Longli County, provincial party Secretary Liu Fangren said: 
Spring plowing and production in our province this year are 
basically over. In the next step of our agricultural production, 
we must grasp field management, the diversified economy, 
township and town enterprises, and the prevention of natural 
disasters to strive for a bumper harvest. 
  Liu Fangren added: Doing a good work in planting and 
transplanting rice seedlings is a prerequisite for a bumper 
grain harvest. After this, we must grasp field management well. 
In some localities, the task of planting flue-cured tobaccos 
has not yet been fulfilled this year, and the acreage devoted to 
tobacco crops has dropped. However, as long as we can do good 
field management work, our production output can also be 
increased despite this reduction in acreage. When the busy 
season of spring production is over, the mass rural work force 
can focus on work in the diversified economy, provided that 
field management is not affected. We must strive to increase 
grain output as well as the peasants' incomes. 
  Liu Fangren continued: We must solidly foster the idea of 
preventing and fighting natural disasters to strive for a bumper 
agricultural harvest. We must draw a lesson from the past, and 
make early preparations for fighting drought. We must on no 
account lower our guard or become careless. Ponds, pools and 
reservoirs must be full of water, and efforts must be made to 
examine and repair drought-fighting equipment and facilities as 
quickly as possible. Oil to be used in the fight against 
drought must be promptly allocated and transported. Where 
precautions have been taken, there is no danger. In the 
meantime, we must also pay attention to preventing and curing 
diseases and eliminating insect pests from farm products to 
strive for another bumper grain harvest this year. 
  Comrade Liu Fangren also made a special trip to Guiding 
County to visit cadres and workers at the 353 Farm, 353 Chicken 
Farm, and the Eighth Military Industrial Hospital of the 
People's Liberation Army. He expressed thanks to all the cadres 
and workers for their contributions to Guizhou's invigoration 
and local development over the past 28 years. 
  Secretary Liu Fangren asked in detail about how military 
industrial enterprises are exploiting their strong points under 
market economic conditions and their situation since moving from 
military to civilian production. He also asked how military 
industrial enterprises are participating in the mass discussion 
of the emancipation of the mind in light of their practical 
conditions, are developing and invigorating themselves, are 
strengthening their training program for qualified personnel, 
are increasing their staying power, and are striving to gain 
market share. He also asked about the livelihood, income, and 
health conditions of retired veteran comrades who had made 
contributions to the establishment of their enterprises. 
  Secretary Liu Fangren said: Military industrial enterprises 
are technically strong and posses a veritable galaxy of talent. 
They must gain a foothold in the market and exploit their own 
exceptional strong points. They must manufacture famous-brand 
and high-quality products and expand Guizhou's influence, so 
that people know more about Guizhou and its military industrial 
enterprises. Cadres and workers in military industrial 
enterprises must work with people throughout the province to 
make still greater contributions to invigorating Guizhou and 
enriching its people.

  [Text] Guiyang, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Construction of the 
Jinjia Coal Mine began recently. It belongs to the Panjiang 
Administration of Mines. 
  The mine is designed to produce 1.8 million tons of coal a 
year. It is expected to go into production within five years. 
The cost of creating the mine will reach 500 million yuan (57 
million U.S. dollars). 
  Fan Jinsheng, an official of the Department of Coal 
Production of Guizhou provincial government, said that Jinjia 
Mine, at the junction of the two provinces of Guizhou and Yunnan 
and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, will help provide 
power and industrial raw materials to a large number of backbone 
enterprises in south-west China. 
  It will thus play an important role in the economic 
development of Guizhou Province and even of the whole south-west 
China area. 
  He said that Guizhou is rich in coal resources. The verified 
reserves of coal deposits amount to 50 billion tons, making the 
province top among the nine provinces and autonomous regions 
south of the Chang Jiang river. 
  The province now produces 45 million tons of coal a year and 
provides a dozen provinces and autonomous regions with coal and 
electricity.

  [Text] Guiyang, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Guizhou, a mountainous 
province in southwest China, which used to suffer from very poor 
communications, now has a highway network covering 95 percent of 
its townships, a density higher than the national average. 
  The total length of the highways in the province has reached 
32,000 kilometers and there are more than 3,200 highway bridges. 
Among the highways are five high-grade ones, including the 
Guiyang- Huangguoshu highway. Construction of some other 
high-grade highways, such as the Guiyang-Zunyi highway and the 
Anshun-Zhijin highway, is well ahead. 
  There was no highway in Guizhou until 1927, when Zhou 
Xicheng, the then governor of Guizhou, bought a "Chevrolet" car. 
It was the first automobile to get to the province, and had to 
be taken apart, making eight pieces, to be carried by manpower 
to the center of Guiyang, capital of the province. 
  Since the founding of New China in 1949, the central 
government has consistently implemented favourable policies to 
encourage Guizhou to build highways. 
  In the past decade, the central government has given large 
subsidies for the purpose. Last year alone, a total of 256 
million yuan (nearly 30 million U.S. dollars) was invested in 
construction of highways in the province. 
  Under the national development program, Guizhou Province 
will 
concentrate on building three express highways in the next ten 
years. 
  The first starts from Guizhou's border with Hunan Province 
and runs westward to end at the border of Guizhou and Yunnan 
Provinces via Kaili, Guiyang and Anshun. 
  It is a 760-kilometer section of a national arterial 
highway, 
the Shanghai-Kunming-Wanding highway. 
  The other two both begin at the border of Guizhou and 
Sichuan 
Provinces and run southward to enter Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous 
Region, respectively via Zunyi, Guiyang and Duyun and via Dafang 
and Anlong. 
  Mo Shiren, vice-governor of Guizhou Province, said that to 
speed up construction of highways was an important part of the 
province's overall strategy for economic development. 
  Only by accelerating the development of communications and 
transport can the province further exploit its rich mineral 
resources and develop its production and processing of farm 
produce. 
  He noted that among all the provinces, municipalities and 
autonomous regions in the country, Guizhou is top in top-grade 
phosphate deposits and second in the reserves of bauxite. It is 
also in the top five in reserves of 25 other minerals. 
  The province also produces fine-quality apples, walnuts and 
peanuts.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sichuan Governor Xiao Yang by staff reporter </F>
Liu Xiaoqing (0491 1420 7230), 12 June--place not given] 
  [Text] Chongqing, 12 Jun (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Xiao 
Yang, governor of Sichuan Province, can be said to be a 
specialist in foreign trade and economic cooperation. He took 
up this work 16 years ago and has spared no efforts to open 
Sichuan and Chongqing wider to the outside world in the past few 
years, no matter whether he was in charge of the government of 
Chongqing City or Sichuan. Xiao Yang has been interviewed by 
this reporter today. 
  Xiao Yang said the reason why China opened the coastal 
cities 
to the outside world first was their favorable geographical 
position. "The coastal cities are close to the sea and the sea 
links them with the outside. However, we are in mountain 
valleys and we are close to Mount Emei." Xiao Yang spoke 
humorously about a solemn topic. 
  "China had to regard the export-oriented economy as the 
dominant factor before it could converge with the international 
economy when it began to open itself up to the outside world. 
The first thing in the export-oriented economy is 
transportation. It takes five days to go from Chongqing to 
Shanghai by water and the distance between the two places is 
3,000 km. How could import processing and compensation trade be 
carried out? How could Sichuan compete with the coastal areas?" 
  Following the development during the past decade or so, the 
scope of China's opening up to the outside world has greatly 
developed and opening up has spread from the coastal and border 
areas to the vast hinterland. At the same time, China's own 
conditions for economic cooperation with foreign countries have 
also become increasingly mature. China's annual volume of 
foreign trade has developed from $20 billion at the end of the 
1970's to the current $200 billion. 
  After giving this reporter a brief account of the general 
situation of China's opening up to the outside world, Xiao Yang 
analyzed several new characteristics in China's opening up at 
present. He said: The first is that the opening up pattern 
with the export-oriented economy as the dominant factor has 
changed into a pattern with the domestic market as the dominant 
factor or a pattern with equal importance given to both the 
domestic and foreign markets. The degree of opening up of 
China's market has greatly increased. Second, China's economic 
level is able to absorb more foreign capital and large foreign 
enterprises have come to make investments in China's hinterland 
one after another. 
  Third, the gap between the coastal areas and the hinterland 
is evident and the state will give more consideration to the 
hinterland or will implement a tilted policy in favor of the 
hinterland. 
  The amount of foreign capital absorbed by Sichuan, he said, 
is determined by the attractiveness and the degree of opening up 
of the market. Foreign businessmen do not come to see Mount 
Emei or the stone carvings of Dazu. They come because of the 
enormous market in Sichuan. As far as the United States is 
concerned, Sichuan's market has provided 150,000 jobs for the 
Americans. This is quite tempting. 
  Foreign businessmen have already occupied the outside market 
quite thoroughly. Are we not taking away what they have 
occupied if we only develop the export-oriented economy? We 
have opened part of our market and they have come immediately. 
Taking Sichuan as an example, Xiao Yang said: Many large 
foreign enterprises came to Sichuan last year and most of them 
were manufacturing enterprises. The largest telephone 
corporation and glass group from the United States came. The 
Siemens Corporation of Germany and the biggest hydropower group 
from Canada also rushed to Sichuan. U.S. General Motors and 
Japan's Honda Automobile Corporation also followed their 
examples and were ready to make investment in Sichuan on a large 
scale. Japan's Honda repeatedly said it had come late. 
  Xiao Yang said: In view of the three characteristics 
mentioned above, provinces in the hinterland should 
energetically adopt measures to cope with the situation. They 
should first of all have a good understanding of their own 
market. Xiao Yang talked about Sichuan's market and he knows it 
like the back of his hand. He said: The annual transaction 
volume of Sichuan's market is 400 billion yuan and Sichuan's 
market grows at a rate of 10 percent each year. This means 
Sichuan has a market of 40 billion yuan for development each 
year and the volume of this market is its capacity to absorb 
foreign capital. Where else can one find such a vast market in 
the world at present? 
  Second, hinterland provinces should give full play to the 
strong points of their own resources. Both Sichuan's 
agriculture and industry have a solid foundation. Besides, 
Sichuan has 1.6 million science and technology workers and rich 
labor resources. The market plus resources and manpower makes 
for the biggest investment environment. 
  Xiao Yang said: In addition to the market, resources, and 
other basic conditions, the efficiency and behavior of the 
government is also very important. The government should ensure 
that foreign businessmen have a normal operational environment 
for investment and should protect the legitimate rights and 
interests of foreign businessmen. At present, some localities 
have taken a few "bites" out of foreign enterprises because they 
are foreign enterprises and have money. How outrageous! 
  Opening up the market is Xiao Yang's basic train of thought 
on opening the hinterland to the outside world. He has already 
put forward and practiced such a train of thought when he was in 
Chongqing a few years ago. This also shows his realistic and 
pioneering spirit in performing official duties. However, Xiao 
Yang also specially pointed out: The market cannot be opened 
indiscriminately. There should be limits and benefits in 
opening the market.

<F P=106> [Unidentified correspondent video report from the "Regional </F>
News Hookup" program] 
  [Excerpts] Chen Kuiyuan, secretary of the Tibet Autonomous 
Regional CPC Committee, recently inspected the Lhasa City Rug 
Factory and Doilungdeqen County. At the rug factory, Secretary 
Chen inquired about its production and earning of foreign 
exchange through exports. At Doilungdeqen County Secretary, 
Chen Kuiyuan visited a water plant at more than 4,000 meters 
above sea level to call on the workers on the frontline. He 
also inquired about the county's agricultural production and 
application of science in farming. [Video shows Chen Kuiyuan 
talking to workers of Lhasa City Rug Factory and cuts to shots 
showing Chen Kuiyuan and other Tibetan leaders visiting farms in 
Doilungdeqen County. This is followed by shot showing Chen 
being interviewed by an unidentified reporter in a room and then

accompanied on the inspection tour by Lieque, member of the 
standing committee of the regional party committee, and Luosang 
Toinzhub, vice chairman of the regional government and mayor of 
Lhasa. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent] What are the plans of the 
regional party committee and the regional government to 
accomplish the tasks of deepening the reform, accelerating 
development, and maintaining stability this year? 
  [Chen Kuiyuan] This year is a crucial year for reform 
throughout the country. In Tibet, the level of economic 
development is comparatively low. It is a region with a 
comparatively backward economy. This being so, it is all the 
more necessary that we seize the opportunity and push forward 
Tibet's economic development by deepening reform and opening 
wider to the outside world. We are unable to compete with the 
rest of the country in our level and speed of economic 
development. However, reform is not only a motive force for 
further development in developed areas, but is also a strong 
motive force for economically backward areas to catch up and 
accelerate development. Therefore, we must seize the 
opportunity for reform. Through deepening reform, we should 
strive to further invigorate Tibet's economy and improve the 
people's living standards. This year, what we should do first 
is to conscientiously implement the guidelines of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Like the 
rest of the country, we should transform the economic structure, 
especially the financial structure, the pricing structure, and 
the planning structure. The state is aiming at building a 
unified and orderly market economy. If there is a lack of 
uniformity in economic structure and operating mechanisms, we 
will face many obstacles in our economic exchanges and economic 
cooperation with the rest of the country, as well as in the 
normal operation of the economy in the autonomous region. 
Therefore, we must first catch up with the rest of the country 
in reform so that we can join other fraternal provinces and 
autonomous regions in marching toward the development goals of 
the end of this century and even of the next century under 
similar economic conditions. [passage omitted] 
  To develop the economy and improve the people's living, we 
need a stable social and economic environment. Judging from the 
current environment of Tibet, the general situation is stable. 
With the efforts of party committees, governments, and 
security, procuratorial, and judicial departments at all levels 
and with the support of the people, Tibet's entire social 
environment is stable. Of course, internationally, a handful of 
people desire to stir up trouble in Tibet. Moreover, they have 
spread lies about turbulence and disturbances occurring in 
Tibet. In fact, the situation which they have been expecting 
has never emerged in Tibet. On the contrary, people here are 
arduously participating in socialist economic construction in a 
relatively peaceful environment. Of course, we are maintaining 
high vigilance against both the internal and external factors of 
instability. Internationally, there is truly a small number of 
people who are unwilling to see Tibet pursue economic 
construction in a stable and peaceful environment. Meanwhile, 
the splittist clique outside Tibet has been trying to win the 
support of international hostile forces in a bid to create chaos 
in Tibet in order to achieve their despicable political 
objective. In Tibet, with the vigorous support and cooperation 
of the cadres and people, we are going all out to participate in 
economic construction. Because of this, a relatively peaceful 
and stable environment has been maintained in the autonomous 
region. In the future, we will continue to adhere to the 
principle of "grasping two links" at the same time and of 
"attaching importance to both" and be ready at all times to 
eliminate the interference of hostile forces so as to ensure the 
smooth progress of Tibet's economic construction and gradual 
improvement of the people's living standards. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Reporter Li Shuxiu (2621 3219 4423) and Correspondent Gu </F>
Laibin (6253 0171 6333): "A New Pattern of Simultaneously 
Developing Coal and Electricity is Being Formed in Our Region"] 
  [Text] Being puzzled for a long time by the external 
shipment, coal mines in our region are implementing the strategy 
of locally converting raw coal. The 10-odd large and 
medium-sized power plants that the autonomous region has newly 
built and expanded or is going to build through various 
investment forms during recent years have provided broad 
prospects for the local conversion of raw coal. A new pattern 
of simultaneously developing coal and electricity is being 
formed in the region. The past situation of mainly relying on 
railways to transport coal from the north to the south and 
delivering coal from the west to the east has been gradually 
substituted by aerial power transmission. 
  Being China's second largest coal base, Inner Mongolia has 
so 
far formed a raw coal annual production capacity of 50 million 
tonnes. However, its external transport capacity is only 30 
percent of the total output. More than 50 percent of the coal 
pits in the three major coal mines in the western part of the 
region are forced to suspend production; the coal pits under 
three bureaus and one mine in the eastern part of the region are 
running under capacity, and are difficult to move ahead; and 
only one-fourth of the dressed coal produced by Dongsheng and 
the "white coal" produced by Gulaben which are famous at home 
and abroad can be transported out of the region. 
  To this end, guided by the state strategy of shifting energy 
development to the west, the regional party committee and 
government have promptly readjusted the development strategy. 
Secretary Wang Qun proposed the idea of "giving priority to 
developing electricity, using electricity to guarantee coal 
industry and coal industry to promote power industry, and 
transmitting more electricity to other localities outside the 
region." From 1988 to 1993, our region made an investment of 
4.8 billion yuan to help add an installed power capacity of 1.5 
million kw. A large number of major power projects were 
distributed and successively initiated in selected areas where 
coal resources are concentrated. The first phase of the 
Fengzhen Power Plant with an installed capacity of 800,000 kw 
has been completed, two power generating units of Jungar Power 
Plant each with a capacity of 100,000 kw have been put into 
production, the first power generating unit of Haibowan Power 
Plant with a capacity of 100,000 kw has been operated for 
commercial purpose, and the two power generating unit expansion 
projects of Huiliuhe Power Plant each with a capacity of 50,000 
kw have begun to feed the power grid. Construction of the newly 
built exceptionally big Dalad Power Plant and the Haibowan and 
Huolinhe Power Plants, and the two expansion projects of 
Yuanbaoshan and Tongliao Power Plants is making headway. A new 
pattern of simultaneously building Wuhai, Wangli, Shengli, 
Baorixile, Yimin, Huolinhe, and Pingzhuang large-scale coal 
production bases and developing power industry is being formed 
in close connection with power development. 
  At present, the two leading industries of coal and 
electricity are unceasingly exploring ways to seek conversion in 
an effort to broaden the development path. Three kinds of local 
conversions of raw coal are seen. First, the mine-run 
type--coal mines run power industry and build pit-head power 
stations. The first phase of the Huolinhe open-cut mine project 
of building two power generating units each with a capacity of 
100,000 kw is in full swing. This coal mine has already formed 
an annual production capacity of 10 million tonnes and its final 
goal is to have an annual capacity of producing an output of 30 
million tonnes of raw coal. Second, the combined-track 
type--the coal and power industries make joint efforts in 
operation and combine their systems together. At present, 
Yiminhe open-cut mine has already formed an annual production 
capacity of 1 million tonnes; the first phase of the Yimin Power 
Plant which is under construction includes the building of two 
power generating units each with a capacity of 500,000 kw; and 
the coal, electricity, and road projects of Jungar will all be 
put into production this year. Third, the simultaneously 
developed type--unified plans are adopted in coal and energy 
developments to seek coordinated and simultaneous development. 
The construction of Wanli mining area with a final scale of 
producing 45 million tonnes of raw coal annually and the Dalad 
Power Plant with an installed capacity of 5 million kw is being 
carried out in a coordinated and simultaneous manner. 
Construction of Shengli Coal Mine with a total scale of 
producing 30 million tonnes of raw coal annually and Zhenglan 
Banner Power Plant with a designed capacity of 3.6 million kw is 
being planned and carried out simultaneously so that the scale 
and development of these two projects will keep pace with each 
other.

  [Text] On the afternoon of 19 June, the municipal party 
committee and the municipal government held a meeting of leading 
cadres of districts, counties, and bureaus to mobilize leading 
cadres at all levels and cadres of party and government organs 
to concentrate a period of time on going deep to enterprises and 
the grass-roots units to conduct investigation and study, to 
size up the situation, to ponder practical ways and do practical 
things, to conscientiously find out where we are lagging behind, 
to formulate measures, to sum up the work of the first half of 
the year in a down-to-earth manner, and to make arrangements for 
the work of the second half of the year. The meeting stressed: 
It is necessary to fully understand the major significance of 
this activity of going deep to the grass-roots units to conduct 
investigation and study and to do practical things, extensively 
create a trend of conducting investigation and study and making 
earnest efforts to do practical things in the whole 
municipality, push all fields of work to a new height, 
comprehensively fulfill or overfulfill this year's various 
tasks, and lay a solid foundation for Tianjin's reform and 
development during next year and for some time to come and for 
creating further brilliant success in Tianjin. 
  Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, gave 
an important speech. Zhang Lichang, deputy secretary of the 
municipal party committee and municipal mayor, presided over 
the meeting. Li Jianguo, deputy secretary of the municipal 
party committee, Nie Bichu, chairman of the municipal people's 
congress standing committee, and Liu Jinfeng, chairman of the 
municipal committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, attended the meeting. 
  In his speech, Gao Dezhan pointed out: The main implications 
of this activity of concentrating a certain period of time on 
going deep to the grass-roots units to conduct investigation and 
study and to do practical things are: Conducting investigation 
is aimed at sizing up the situation and conducting study is 
aimed at pondering practical methods. With practical methods in 
hand, we should also implement them and do practical things. We 
must see the actual results to judge whether we have really 
implemented them or not. This move is aimed at developing the 
current excellent situation and better promoting the work of the 
second half of this year. Generally speaking, in going to the 
grass-roots units, we have three major objectives: First, we 
must further promote the change of work style of leading cadres 
and the change of functions of leading organs. During this 
activity of going deep to the grass-roots units, leading cadres 
at all levels must conduct investigation and study and ponder 
practical methods. All leading organs should change functions 
and do practical things. Second, we should further develop our 
municipality's excellent situation and maintain a good trend in 
all fields of work. In line with the overall plan of the 
enlarged plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee, 
we should promote this work during the middle stage, size up the 
situation through conducting meticulous investigation and study, 
know how the matter stands, list out the difficult points, find 
out the problems, and put forward countermeasures and measures 
in the light of the problems and weak aspects. Third, we should 
further maintain close ties with the masses and mobilize the 
enthusiasm of the broad masses of people. Through this 
activity, we should further improve the mass feelings, pool the 
strength of the masses, further arouse the enthusiasm of the 
broad masses of people in participating in reform, promoting 
development, and safeguarding stability, and form a vivid 
situation in the whole municipality in which the higher and the 
lower levels work with one heart and one mind and make concerted 
efforts to carry out reform and construction. 
  Gao Dezhan stressed: the general tasks and demands of this 
activity of conducting investigation and study and doing 
practical things are to size up the situation, ponder practical 
methods, and do practical things on the basis of summing up the 
work of the first half of this year and making work arrangements 
for the second half of the year, grasp the work of the second 
half of this year more firmly, rapidly, and successfully, 
comprehensively fulfill the aforementioned three objectives, and 
successfully accomplish the following four tasks. 1) We should 
conscientiously sum up the work of the first half of this year. 
In addition to summing up the achievements and experiences in a 
down-to-earth manner, we should also honestly find out problems 
and where we are lagging behind. It is also necessary to place 
the emphasis in sizing up the real situation and fining out 
where we are lagging behind. In this aspect, we should attend to 
the major issues. First, we should maintain close connection 
with the overall work situation of the entire party and country, 
with an emphasis in finding out where we are lagging behind in 
deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, 
and maintaining stability, and in ending deficits, increasing 
profits, and raising efficiency. Second, on the basis of finding 
out where we are lagging behind in the system of assuming 
responsibility for fulfilling a certain work objectives, we 
should conscientiously investigate and examine the situation of 
implementing this system among leading cadres. Third, we should 
find out where we are lagging behind in the major work of our 
own departments, localities, and units. In this aspect, we 
should not only find out where we are lagging behind in work but 
also in ideology. 2) We should make proper work arrangements for 
the second half of the year. On the basis of summing up the 
work, we should specify countermeasures and measures for 
successfully carrying out the work of the second half of this 
year and formulate practical methods that comply with the 
reality and are workable, and can solve problems. It is 
necessary to avoid giving vague and general directions while 
formulating measures and making work arrangements. As far as the 
work of whole municipality is concerned, the various tasks 
defined in this year's work targets responsibility system must 
be fulfilled or overfulfilled, the unfulfilled ones left over by 
the first half of the year must be accomplished, the weak 
aspects must be strengthened, and all fields of work set for 
this year must be done better compared with last year; during 
the second half of this year, strenuous efforts must be exerted 
to deepen reform, particularly enterprise reform, tackle reform 
problems, and accomplish this year's reform tasks and 
objectives; energy should be concentrated on ending enterprise 
deficits, increasing profits, and raising efficiency during the 
second half of the year, and more financial revenues should be 
collected, more profits should be created by enterprises, and 
the urban and rural masses should earn more. Difficult 
enterprises, in particular, should strive to rapidly take a turn 
for the better and enable staff and workers to have a higher 
income. Furthermore, we should realistically attend to spiritual 
civilization, comprehensive improvement of public security, and 
party building. 3) We should concentrate efforts on summing up 
and popularizing a number of typical examples. To grasp the 
typical examples, it is necessary to sum up a number of good 
examples during this activity of going to the grass-roots units 
and achieve big breakthroughs in using typical experiences to 
promote work in the entire area and to solve difficulties in 
work. 4) We should help the grass-roots units solve problems 
and do practical things for enterprises in a down-to-earth 
manner. During this activity, we should go not only to units 
which have done a good job in their work but also to units with 
great difficulties and many problems in an effort to attain the 
goal of doing practical things and helping grass-roots units 
solve problems in the course of conducting investigation and 
study. It is necessary to realistically change functions, exert 
real efforts to do practical things for enterprises and 
grass-roots units, honestly do some practical things for 
enterprises, and create good external conditions for them. The 
number of problems solved should be regarded as a standard for 
testing the results of this activity. 
  Gao Dezhan demanded: To organize this large-scale activity, 
we have to concentrate a period of time, assume heavy tasks, and 
set high standards because it involves the work of many sectors. 
Party committees and governments at all levels must attach 
prime importance to it, realistically strengthen leadership, 
organize work carefully, clearly define tasks, attend to 
priorities, and guarantee that this activity will be smoothly 
carried out and actual results will be achieved. 1) We should 
carry out all sorts of organizational work in places where it is 
needed. Leading cadres at all levels, particularly the first 
two top leaders, should take the lead in going to the 
grass-roots units, earnestly practice what they advocate, and 
take the lead in setting examples. We must set the time. 
Cadres going to the grass-roots units must guarantee that they 
will devote more than 15 days to conducting investigation and 
study at the grass-roots level and do practical things for them. 
The entire activity must be carried out in a well-organized and 
planned manner, and by no means should it be let alone. 2) We 
should highlight priorities. It is necessary to proceed from our 
own reality, attend to the major contradictions, grasp the 
priorities and key units, strive to effectively solve a number 
of difficult problems that affect or restrict the development in 
various fields, enable a number of key units to achieve fairly 
big progress in their work, and make some backward units or 
units with many problems have a turn for the better and change 
the outlook. 3) We should realistically change the work style. 
We must not just travel from one office to another. We should 
go to plants, rural areas, shops, schools, and the grass-roots 
units. We must be good at using our brains, realistically size 
up the actual situation, ponder practical methods, and attain 
the aim of seeking actual results. We must be clean and 
self-disciplined and be thrifty and simple in work style, use 
simple means of transportation and have fewer people in our 
company, and become one with the masses, and must not give 
trouble or add burdens to the grass-roots units. Still less 
should we be allowed to seek special privilege or practice 
unhealthy trends. 4) We should pay attention to actual results. 
In addition to realistically sizing up the real situation, 
pondering practical methods, doing practical things, solving a 
number of problems, and expediting the work, all levels should 
do a good job in summing up their work done during the first 
half of this year and make work arrangements for the second half 
of the year. Each and every leading cadre should genuinely go 
to the grass roots to get firsthand information and personally 
write his investigation report. 
  Gao Dezhan emphatically pointed out: Recently, Comrade Jiang 
  Zemin gave a speech at the commencement of the fourth 
theoretical discussion class for principal leading cadres of the 
provincial and ministerial levels in which he gave important 
views on the issue of unceasingly deepening the study of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics in the whole party. This speech is of great 
guiding significance in successfully carrying out this 
municipality-wide activity of conducting investigation and study 
and doing practical things. The process of going deep to the 
grass-roots units to conduct investigation and study is not only 
a process of applying scientific theories to solving practical 
issues but also a process of bringing practical issues to the 
class in the course of deeply studying this theory. This 
activity of going deep to the grass-roots units to conduct 
investigation and study and to do practical things for them is a 
major move of summing up and popularizing the work in line with 
the general tasks of the whole party and country; a major move 
of promoting the change of work style of cadres and the change 
of functions of organs and maintaining close ties with the 
masses; and a major move of deeply studying Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics in line with reality. During this process, we 
should consciously combine the activity of conducting 
investigation and study and doing practical things with the 
study of theory, use this theory to guide practice, solve 
practical problems, and enable the ideological and theoretical 
levels and the ability of solving practical problems of cadres 
at all levels to enter a new height. 
  Zhang Lichang called for efforts to rapidly relay the 
guidelines of this meeting to leading bodies at all levels and 
cadres of all party and government organs, unify thinking, 
enhance understanding, proceed from the reality of one's own 
department, locality, and unit, organize the work carefully, and 
make overall planning and proper arrangements; strengthen 
leadership, set strict demands, clearly define the tasks for 
cadres going down to the grass-roots units, and avoid formalism. 
It is necessary to solve problems and to expedite the work in 
the course of conducting investigation and study, and strive to 
achieve actual results. 
  Also attending this meeting were members of the standing 
committee of the municipal party committee, vice chairmen of the 
municipal people's congress standing committee, vice mayors, 
vice chairmen of the municipal committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference, and principal responsible 
comrades of various departments, committees, offices, districts, 
counties, bureaus, and mass organizations, a total of 700 people.

  [Text] Tianjin, June 21 (XINHUA) -- A new geothermal field 
of 840 sq m [square meters] has been discovered near this north 
China port city. 
  According to a local energy official, a three-year survey of 
geothermal reserves in the area is well on its way to completion. 
  Geologists say the temperature at the well mouth of the 
"Shanlinzi" geothermal field, which is the second-biggest after 
the Wanglanzhuang field, that has ever discovered in this city, 
is between 75 and 96 degrees centigrade. 
  The amount of heat that can be used is equivalent to that 
given off by 12.23 million tons of standard coal, they claim. 
  The exploration of geothermal resources in this area started 
in the 1970s. To date, some 14 thermal wells have been drilled 
and tap to serve industry, agriculture and animal husbandry, 
tourism and daily life of local people. 
  Tianjin boasts rich geothermal resources, and some ten 
geothermal fields have been found. They cover a total area of 
3,074 sq m and have a total hot water reserve of 7.876 cu m 
[cubic meters].

  [Text] Tianjin, June 22 (XINHUA) -- A new joint venture 
container company has been set up in Tianjin, north China's 
biggest industrial center. 
  The company, co-financed by the Tianjin port and a container 
firm of the Republic of Korea, is the thirtieth joint venture to 
be built in the port. 
  The port now has eight container berths capable of handling 
over one million containers yearly. 
  The container turnover time has been shortened to 21 days 
from the previous 45 days due to a land-and-water coordinated 
transport system with more than 120 inland container relay 
stations built in Baotou, Zhengzhou, Xian, Chengdu, Yinchuan and 
Lanzhou cities. 
  The company has opened over 50 water routes for scheduled 
container shipments to more than 160 countries and regions 
around the world.

  [Excerpts] The anticorruption leading group of the 
provincial party committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon 
[22 June] at which it was stressed that greater efforts should 
be made to investigate and handle major and important cases in a 
selective way, and to raise the province's anticorruption 
struggle to a new level. 
  The current meeting studied the implementation of the spirit 
of the meeting of the Central Commission for Political Science 
and Law and the national conference of discipline inspection and 
supervision organs, and made arrangements for the province's 
anticorruption struggle in the next stage. The meeting also 
adopted the report on the achievements made in the past 10 
months of the anticorruption struggle throughout the province. 
According to statistics, during that period, procuratorial 
organs at all levels throughout the province accepted 687 
economic criminal cases for prosecution, of which 208 were 
embezzlement and bribe taking cases, constituting 40 percent of 
the cases filed for investigation and prosecution. Of the 687 
economic criminal cases accepted, 145 were major cases involving 
more than 10,000 yuan in funds, and 34 were important cases 
involving cadres at the county and departmental levels and 
above. Compared with the previous year, the number of cases 
filed for investigation and prosecution and the number of major 
and important cases doubled and redoubled. This shows that 
phased achievements have been made in the anticorruption 
struggle. 
  The meeting held that although some achievements have been 
made in the province's anticorruption struggle, there are still 
many problems. Their main manifestations are that the 
development of the anticorruption struggle is imbalanced; there 
is a gap of understanding among leading cadres; and because laws 
are not enforced strictly and no effective measures are taken to 
fight corruption, the investigation and prosecution of cases 
proceed slowly. [passage omitted] 
  Provincial party Secretary Yin Kesheng and Deputy Secretary 
Cai Zhulin delivered speeches one after another. [passage 
omitted] 
  In their speeches, they particularly urged cadres of the 
discipline inspection and supervision organs, as well as cadres 
and functionaries of political-legal organs, to enforce laws 
impartially by removing barriers and obstructions, to promote 
the province's work in all fields of endeavor with the victories 
scored in the anticorruption struggle, keep the spirits of the 
masses of people high through the anticorruption struggle, and 
strive to elevate the province's work in all fields to a new 
level.

  [Text] On the morning of 7 June, 12 enterprises in our 
province received the nameplate of a window enterprise for 
supervision of administrative law enforcement from the 
provincial legislative affairs bureau. They have thus become 
the first batch of units conducting experiments in supervision 
of administrative law enforcement to protect enterprises' 
legitimate rights and interests and standardize the government's 
administrative behavior. 
  At present, as we are developing the socialist [words 
indistinct] economic management departments and monopolistic 
trades turn power into a commodity by using the power in their 
hands and their monopolistic status. These unhealthy practices 
or corrupt phenomena have done serious harm to the inviolability 
of the law and the authority of the government. To further 
strengthen supervision of law enforcement and protect 
enterprises' legitimate rights and interests, the provincial 
Legislative Affairs Bureau decided to set up pilot window 
enterprises to supervise and administer law enforcement across 
the province in light of the realities. Through extensive 
investigations and consultations, the bureau decided to 
designate 12 representative enterprises, including the Xining 
Steelworks and the Qinghai Bank of Agriculture, as the first 
batch of window enterprises to supervise and administer law 
enforcement. 
  Xu Tongqing, deputy director of [words indistinct] of the 
provincial people's congress; Lan Faliang, deputy secretary 
general of the provincial government; Yang Miaoling, director of 
the provincial legislative affairs bureau; and other comrades 
issued nameplates to the 12 enterprises. At the 
nameplate-issuing ceremony, they stressed: All window 
enterprises should expose and report administrative law 
violations, particularly administrative power-for-money 
behavior, promptly and accurately provide administrative 
law-enforcement information, especially administrative 
power-for-money information to judicial organs, and help the 
latter do a good job of cleaning up window enterprises. At the 
same time, they should study and abide by the law, standardize 
their own behavior with the law, and strive to be models in 
observing discipline and abiding by the law. 
  It has been learned that since the implementation of the 
supervision of administrative law enforcement, the provincial 
legislative affairs bureau will further expand the number of the 
window enterprises when conditions permit and continuously 
deepen the supervision of administrative law enforcement.

  [Text] The Provincial Department of Radio and Television, 
the Provincial Department of Culture, the Provincial 
Administration for Industry and Commerce, the Provincial 
Department of Public Security, the Provincial Press and 
Publications Administration, and the Provincial Copyright 
Administration have launched a joint inspection of the audio and 
video tape markets in the Xian area. In audio-visual product 
stores in the Dachengshi section of Beida District, inspectors 
seized 360 pirated cassette tapes, 547 video tapes, 1,390 
compact discs, and 119 laser discs. Some of these audio and 
video products contained indecent material and others were 
poorly produced. During the inspection, inspectors discovered 
that some audio-visual product stores were operating without a 
business license, while others did not have any legitimate 
source of supply. The store operators did not have any 
understanding of copyrights and lacked the ability to tell 
genuine products from counterfeit ones. 
  It has been learned that, since March this year, in Xian 
City 
proper, the authorities have seized a substantial amount of 
pirated audio-visual products, specifically, over 140,000 audio 
tapes and close to 100,000 video tapes.

  [Text] Beijing, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Lu Ping, director of 
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, 
expressed the hope here today that the civil servants in Hong 
Kong focus all their attention on their work and do not worry 
about seniority with pay. 
  The seniority with pay has been stipulated clearly in the 
basic law and there is also financial guarantee in this regard, 
Lu said, referring to the idea that a fund be set up before 
China resumes the exercise of power over Hong Kong in 1997. 
  With its promises on this and other matters, the Chinese 
government will never try to shift its responsibility, Lu told a 
visiting delegation from the association of the former senior 
civil servants of Hong Kong, led by former secretary for land 
and works Chan Nai-keong. 
  Hong Kong civil servants can continue their service after 
1997, Lu said. Only the chief civil servants will have to be 
nominated by the chief administrator of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region and confirmed by the central government, 
which is designed to make the future government highly efficient. 
  During the meeting, Lu Ping also solicited opinions from the 
group on the links between the future executive and legislative 
bodies. 
  Some proposed that more Hong Kong civil servants should have 
access to Chinese courses on the mainland to enable them to 
learn more about it, with which Lu agreed.

  [Text] Hong Kong, June 22 (AFP) -- Sino-British talks on 
Hong Kong were making headway Wednesday, negotiators said, as a 
top Chinese official suggested Beijing was prepared to accept a 
financing plan for the colony's new airport. 
  "We've covered a lot of ground. The atmosphere continues to 
be constructive," chief British negotiator Hugh Davies said 
after the second day of Sino-British Joint Liaison Group talks. 
  He declined to give details, but Davies and Chinese 
counterpart Guo Fengmin promised to say "something more" when 
their meeting winds up on Thursday. 
  On Friday the Joint Liaison Group's specialized airport 
committee is to discuss the vexed issue of how much debt to 
raise to pay for the 20.3 billion U.S. dollar Chek Lap Kok 
airport and related public works. 
  The Joint Liaison Group is the diplomatic body charged with 
hammering out technical details of Hong Kong's 1997 handback to 
China. This week's meeting is its first in six months. 
  In an interview with the Asian Wall Street Journal, 
Beijing's 
top official for Hong Kong affairs, Lu Ping, said China was 
"very flexible" on the financing issue. 
  "Britain has been indicating that it wants to cooperate with 
the Chinese side on the economic front," Lu was quoted as 
saying. "We are waiting to see their deeds." 
  The airport financing issue has been overshadowed since 1992 
by Governor Chris Patten's pre-1997 democratic reform plans, the 
final stage of which is to be adopted next week by the 
Legislative Council. 
  Picking up on Foreign Minister Qian Qichen's statement last 
week that China was willing to bury the hatchet when it comes to 
Patten's political reforms, Lu said: "Chris Patten is someone 
beyond our control." 
  Under a 1991 agreement with Britain, China must be consulted 
if Hong Kong wants to raise more than five billion Hong Kong 
dollars (646.83 million U.S.) of airport-related debt maturing 
after 1997. 
  But Lu said Beijing now was ready to accept a debt level 
"far 
about five [as received]." He did not elaborate. 
  Hong Kong favors tapping world capital markets to help pay 
for Chek Lap Kok, taking advantage of the best interest rates in 
many years, but China dreads that too much debt will be left 
behind once Britain departs in 1997.

<F P=106> [Report: "Hong Kong XINHUA Deputy Director Zheng Guoxiong </F>
Urges Britain to Give Up Confrontation, Effect a Fundamental 
Change in Policy"] 
  [Text] Zheng Guoxiong, deputy director of Hong Kong branch 
of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, talked about recent Sino-British ties 
at an open occasion yesterday. He said that the key to 
improvement in Sino-British ties lies in Britain's attitude and 
action. Zheng urged the British side to give up its policy of 
confrontation with China and effect a fundamental change in its 
policy. 
  The Association of New Territories Mass Organizations held a 
gathering yesterday to mark the ninth anniversary of its 
founding and to congratulate its members being elected as 
deputies of National People's Congress, members of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] and the 
Preliminary Working Committee, Hong Kong affairs advisers, 
deputies to the Guangdong People's Congress, members of the 
Guangdong CPPCC, and Hong Kong district affairs advisers. In 
response to a question by a reporter at the gathering, Zheng 
Guoxiong said that everybody is concerned about recent 
Sino-British relations. While meeting with state leaders in 
Beijing, the same question was raised by members of delegations 
from the Hong Kong Federation of Industry and the Hong Kong 
Chinese Chamber of Commerce. 
  In accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Zheng 
said, China and Britain should cooperate in resolving major 
issues related to Hong Kong's transition because this will 
benefit Hong Kong's smooth transition. This is also the 
consistent stand and position of the Chinese Government. 
  The British Government had changed its policy toward China 
at 
the previous stage, made a mistaken evaluation of the situation, 
and pursued a policy of confrontation with China, which produced 
a negative impact on Sino-British cooperation, Zheng stated. 
  Now the key to resumption of Sino-British cooperation lies 
in 
Britain's attitude and action, Zheng continued, and the Chinese 
Government hopes that the British side will give up its policy 
of confrontation and will effect a fundamental change in its 
policy. Zheng stressed that because of the unilateral action 
taken by Patten, it has been impossible for China and Britain to 
cooperate in the political system. Proceeding from the 
fundamental and long-term interests of the Hong Kong residents 
and for the sake of maintaining Hong Kong's stability and 
prosperity, however, the Chinese Government still hopes to 
cooperate with the British side in terms of economy, people's 
livelihood, and other fields. This is also the consistent 
spirit of the Chinese Government toward Hong Kong. 
  The Hong Kong government's proposal to increase openness in 
information access involved a major change in government 
operations and did not conform with the relevant spirit of the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration, Zheng Guoxiong stated. As the 
British Hong Kong government did not consult the Chinese side in 
advance, it is unacceptable to the Chinese side. 
  Zheng also refuted the so-called statement that this was 
Hong 
Kong's internal affair. He said that the move involved the 
transition to 1997 and exerted an influence on current, as well 
as future operations. Therefore, the Chinese side must be 
consulted. Otherwise, the Chinese Government will not undertake 
any responsibility. Neither will the future government of the 
special administrative region undertake any responsibility.

<F P=106> [By M.Y. Sung in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] China has dismissed diplomatic concerns that it 
might plant spies and informers in foreign consulates in Hong 
Kong after 1997. 
  Diplomatic missions in the territory fear a Foreign 
Ministry-run government agency might centralise their supply of 
local staff when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. 
  Under the Basic Law, the Central People's Government will be 
responsible for foreign affairs in the Special Administrative 
Region (SAR). 
  But China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told The HONGKONG 
STANDARD it had no intention of changing current consulate 
practices which allow foreign diplomatic missions in the 
territory absolute freedom to recruit their own staff. 
  In a statement, the Foreign Ministry said all 
consulate-related matters would be further examined, but that 
basically China was unwilling to change the territory's usual 
practices. 
  "After China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty 
over 
Hong Kong, the present system will basically remain unchanged," 
the Foreign Ministry said. 
  Staff such as office clerks, interpreters, drivers or 
domestic helpers at diplomats' residences are usually recruited 
through public advertisements in local newspapers. 
  Sources argued the practice of planting bugs and spies in 
foreign diplomatic missions was not only used by communist 
countries but also by many Western nations. 
  "Under the present staff recruitment rules, spies and 
informers can still mingle in foreign consulates in Hong Kong," 
a source said. 
  The question of whether new recruitment rules will be 
introduced for the territory's foreign consulates is a very 
"minor issue to China. 
  "A principle has been stipulated under the Basic Law on the 
questions concerning the establishment of foreign consulates in 
Hong Kong," the Foreign Ministry statement said. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofeng explained that 
foreign affairs issues in Hong Kong would be handled by China 
under the Basic Law provisions which referred to major 
diplomatic policy. 
  "The Foreign Ministry will not take care of those small 
concrete things," Mr Shen said, referring to staff recruitment 
for foreign diplomatic missions in Hong Kong. 
  "The local staff recruitment rules for consulates are among 
considerable number of matter that have not yet been fully 
studied by the Foreign Ministry."

  [Text] Hong Kong, 17 Jun (XINHUA) -- The Defense and 
Public Security Experts subgroup of the Sino-British Joint 
Liaison Group ended its 16th meeting in Hong Kong yesterday. 
The parties did not reach a consensus in all aspects on the 
transfer of military-use land in Hong Kong, but made progress on 
some issues. Both parties agreed to hold an informal meeting in 
the next few days to continue their consultations. 
  In his interview with reporters after the meeting, Chen 
Zuoer, head of the Chinese delegation, said: During these four 
days, both parties have further narrowed their discrepancies and 
made some progress. But there are some issues which need 
further discussions. The Chinese side will try its best to 
continue to seek a resolution to some pending problems in an 
informal and flexible manner so as to reach an agreement at the 
earliest possible date.

  [Text] China is to significantly boost the staff of its key 
policy branch on Hong Kong affairs in the next two months to 
help speed up preparations for the 1997 handover. 
  About 16 newly-recruited staff will join the Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office in the face of the increasing workload on 
transitional matters. 
  The extra staff will mainly work under the two major 
departments on political and economic affairs, headed by Xu Ze 
and Zhang Liangdong. At present, each department has about 20 
staff who help formulate China's strategy on matters ranging 
from the airport plan, localisation of civil service and Joint 
Liaison Group issues. 
  The extra staff have been recruited in the past few months 
following a decision by the Chinese Government to increase 
staffing of the office in view of the growing workload. Sources 
said the new recruits were all fresh graduates from major 
universities in Beijing. 
  "Of course, it's most ideal to have people who have already 
had some experience on Hong Kong affairs transferred from other 
departments. But the pool of experienced staff is really too 
small. We can only look for fresh university graduates," an 
official said. 
  The official said the extra staff would have to be given 
training on the background to the Hong Kong issues. 
  He said the additional staff would help strengthen the 
research team of the two departments and the sup porting team 
for the Preliminary Working Committee. 
  Officials said the staff in crease was imperative because 
workloads had risen in the lead-up to 1997.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Why Should Compensations Be Made If the </F>
Employment Contract Is Not Renewed After Expiration?"] 
  [Text] Recently, the secretary for civil service affairs of 
the Hong Kong Government announced that he had explained to 
administrative officers employed according to overseas contracts 
that all expatriate employees in the policy-making branches of 
the Government Secretariat will have to retire by the age of 57; 
at the same time, the Government will promote local 
administrative officers to various secretary posts ahead of 
their previous expatriate superiors. After the secretary for 
civil service affairs made the announcement, the overseas civil 
servants revealed more inside stories. It was said that the 
Hong Kong Government had promised to pay compensation to A- and 
B-class expatriate officials in the policy-making branches who 
could not be promoted. As the expatriate officials in the 
policy-making branches will be forced to retire ahead of the 
retirement age or will not be promoted, they will bring a suit 
against the Government, which has harmed their "human rights." 
  The suit brought by the overseas civil servants against the 
Hong Kong Government was based on the "Human Rights Act" 
formulated by the Hong Kong Government. They held that taking 
legal action against the government on the basis of the new act 
certainly would drive the Government into an awkward predicament 
in the proceedings. Such handling of the personnel arrangements 
for secretary-level officials by the Hong Kong Government 
obviously was a deliberate ploy to leave some loopholes so that 
excuses could be found to make compensation before its power 
comes to an end. 
  The Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulates that the 
administration of the British Hong Kong Government will come to 
an end on 30 June 1997; and the Basic Law stipulates that the 
secretary-level officials will be Chinese citizens who are 
permanent residents of Hong Kong. Therefore, the British Hong 
Kong Government cannot sign any employment contracts with 
expatriate civil servants which extend beyond 1997. Moreover, 
the Hong Kong Government has long announced its civil service 
localization policy. When Edward Youde and David Wilson were 
governors, local Chinese officials were promoted to be branch 
secretaries and department directors. This fact never aroused 
any controversy. However, after Chris Patten took the 
governorship in 1992, the Hong Kong Government took such 
measures as the naturalization of expatriate civil servants and 
the adoption of the Human Rights Act, and this thus led to the 
troublesome legal proceedings taken by the expatriate civil 
servants against the government. 
  Why did the expatriate officials at the posts of branch 
secretary and department director obediently retire without 
taking legal proceedings before Patten took the governorship? 
There were two reasons. First, according to the Letters Patent 
and the Royal Instructions, all officials must obey the 
governor, and the governor does not need to give any explanation 
when deciding to promote or not to promote any official, or to 
require any official to retire. Second, all expatriate civil 
servants signed employment contracts that did not extend beyond 
1997, and the contracts were normally two-year or four-year 
ones. Moreover, the Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions 
were constitutional documents, which naturally took precedence 
over any local legislation. 
  According to newspaper reports in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong 
Government and the secretary-level expatriate officials have 
reached a secret agreement, and the government will pay HK$2.9 
million in compensation to them. The local public was not 
consulted before this arrangement was made, and the Legislative 
Council was not briefed. After this is made a fait accompli, 
Hong Kong taxpayers will be forced to pay the bill without an 
opportunity to say no. 
  According to usual practice, if the employment contract of 
an 
expatriate civil servant is not to be renewed, the government 
will give notice 10 months ahead of its expiration. Once the 
contract expires, the expatriate civil servant will have to 
leave office, and the government will not have to pay any 
compensation. In the current cases, however, some expatriate 
officials received the relevant notices 18 months ahead of the 
expiration of their employment contracts, and they had 
sufficient time to seek new jobs in private institutions. How 
could they be paid special compensation, or bring a suit in 
court? Will the expatriate civil servants whose employment 
contracts were not renewed before Patten took office also take 
similar legal proceedings so as to claim compensation? If no 
compensation is paid to the latter, how will the Hong Kong 
Government justify its double standard? 
  In the Common Law areas, the expiration of the employment 
contracts indicates the termination of the employment 
relationship between the employer and the employee, and there 
exists no issue of compensation. Now the Hong Kong Government 
is showing its "generosity" by bestowing the Hong Kong people's 
money in violation of legal principles and standard practice, 
and without regard for the interests of Hong Kong people. 
  The present state of affairs shows that the "Human Rights 
Act" is a carefully calculated plan of the British Hong Kong 
authorities ahead of their withdrawal. On the surface, the act 
was aimed at guaranteeing Hong Kong people's human rights; in 
reality, it served some different purposes. According to the 
"Human Rights Act," those who try to evade taxes or dodge their 
creditors may flee Hong Kong without being held up by the court 
and without being detained. What a disorderly situation will 
this cause! 
  From the Hong Kong Government's plan for the naturalization 
of the expatriate civil servants to the arrangement for huge 
amounts of compensation for expatriate civil servants who leave 
office after the expiration of their employment contracts -- all 
these facts show how the colonial rulers are using public office 
for private gain. The Hong Kong people now are worried that the 
expatriate officials in the Mass Transit Rail Corporation, the 
Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, and the Provisional Airport 
Authority will follow the example of the expatriate government 
officials in taking away a huge amount of compensation before 
1997.

  [Text] Beijing, 18 Jun (XINHUA) -- The Social and Security 
Special Group under the Preliminary Working Committee of the 
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region held its fifth meeting at the Hong Kong-Macao Center in 
Beijing from 17 to 18 June. The participants discussed the 
issue of reflux immigration among Hong Kong permanent residents 
who are Chinese citizens. 
  The committee members noted: Chinese citizens among Hong 
Kong's permanent residents who obtain foreign nationality status 
following their emigration before 1997 are no longer Chinese 
citizens. Therefore, they will not be accorded the permanent 
residence status according to the provisions contained in items 
1 and 2, paragraph 2, Article 24 of the Basic Law, but they may 
obtain permanent residence status in accordance with item 4 
under paragraph 2 of Article 24 provided they meet the three 
requirements set in the item. However, in studying this issue, 
it is necessary to take into consideration that the Basic Law 
takes effect on 1 July 1997 and that objective and subjective 
laws stipulating Hong Kong as the place of permanent residence 
will not be enacted until after 1997. This is, in fact, a 
question of transition. Therefore, the British Hong Kong 
Government is urged to revise its "Regulations on the Entry of 
People" as soon as possible in order to make its prescribed 
requirements for permanent residents in complete accord with the 
provisions of the Basic Law.

  [Text] Hong Kong, June 21 (XINHUA) -- The XINHUA NEWS 
AGENCY Hong Kong [HK] branch today donated a total of 425,980 HK 
dollars (about 54,613 U.S. dollars) to help relieve the 
devastating floods in six south China provinces and regions. 
  The branch also set up a special flood relief office and 
re-opened a flood relief account in Bank of China Hong Kong 
branch to receive donations from Hong Kong residents and 
organizations. 
  Up to now, Hong Kong residents and organizations, together 
with major Chinese (mainland) institutions in the territory, 
have donated about 30 million HK dollars (about 3.846 million 
U.S. dollars) for the flood-hit areas. 
  Since early June, the provinces and regions of Guangdong, 
Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang and Fujian have suffered from 
severe floods which caused 438 people dead and 480,000-plus 
houses down with an estimated economic loss of 17 billion 
renminbi yuan (about 1.954 billion U.S. dollars).

  [Text] Beijing will develop alternative travel documents 
for Hong Kong residents not eligible for Special Administrative 
Region (SAR) passports after 1997 under proposals being studied 
by the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC). The China-appointed 
think-tank will also study a systematic plan for thousands of 
mainland children with Hong Kong parents to return to the 
territory. 
  The PWC's social security group ended a two-day session in 
Beijing yesterday to draft a working agenda for the next six 
months. The PWC social security group local leader Rita Fan said 
an alternative to the SAR passport could be needed for residents 
who had not gained permanent residency by living in the 
territory for seven years. While details were yet to be 
finalised, Mrs Fan said the documents would probably apply to 
people who use Document of Identity (DI) as their travel papers. 
  Under the present system, about 1.5 million Hong Kong people 
hold British Dependent Territory Citizen (BDTC) passports and 
are able to apply for British National Overseas (BNO) passports. 
Those who were not born in the territory, but obtained right of 
abode after living here continuously for seven years, can use 
the Certificate of Identity (CI) as their travel documents. 
They are not entitled to apply for BDTC passports. People 
living here who have not yet fulfilled the seven years 
continuous residence requirement can use their original passport 
or a Document of Identity (DI). 
  Mrs Fan said BNO and CI holders would be entitled to apply 
for passports issued by the Special Administrative Region (SAR) 
government. But DI holders-might not qualify. 
  The PWC would also focus on the fate of at least 75,000 
mainland children who will be allowed into Hong Kong after 1997. 
Under the Basic Law ethnic Chinese children born outside the 
territory to Hong Kong permanent residents will have right of 
abode in the territory. While the Hong Kong government has 
extended the number of children allowed into the territory each 
day there are still fears of a flood of immigrants on 1 July 
1997. Mrs Fan said the PWC needed to make arrangements to allow 
the systematic arrival of children in Hong Kong after 1997.

  [Text] Hong Kong's post-1997 government is set to tighten 
restrictions on political activists for the sake of maintaining 
stability in the territory under Chinese rule. 
  Beijing's political think-tank on Hong Kong affairs, the 
Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), has recommended that the 
Special Administrative Region (SAR) government withdraw key 
political freedoms granted in the territory in recent years. 
The PWC will recommend the SAR government restore restrictions 
on political organisations which were removed from the 1949 
Societies Ordinance in 1992 to conform with the Bill of Rights. 
  Political societies in Hong Kong would be prohibited from 
forming ties with foreign organisations. Formation of new 
political organisations would not be allowed without permission 
from the government. The PWC warned the SAR government would 
also overturn amendments--if they were adopted--currently before 
the Legislative Council curbing police powers to stop and search 
people, and easing restrictions on public demonstrations. PWC 
members said the changes contravened the Basic Law--Hong Kong's 
mini-constitution after 1997- and breached the spirit of the 
1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. The PWC said the changes 
reduced the government's control over political organisations 
and activists and threatened the territory's stability. 
  PWC legal group co-convenor Shao Tianren, a Chinese official 
who advises the Foreign Ministry, said the spirit of the Joint 
Declaration--stipulating the conditions under which Hong Kong 
would revert to Chinese rule--made it clear that the law in 
force in the territory since 1984 should remain basically 
unchanged. He said "any major change in the transitional period 
should be negotiated with the Chinese side". He said the SAR 
government would not adopt major legal changes introduced 
unilalerally by the British-Hong Kong government. 
  The government hopes to amend the Public Order Ordinance and 
the Societies Ordinance to make them conform with the Bill of 
Rights. But China claimed this violate the Basic Law. 
  "Any amendments or new legislation made between 1984 (the 
year the Joint Declaration was signed) and 1997 should not be 
regarded as original law of the territory (and should be 
negotiated first with China)," co-convenor Simon Li said. The 
former local Appeal Court judge said he suspected the Hong Kong 
government had attempted to circumvent the Basic Law by making 
the changes. He also accused the government of granting too 
much political freedom since 1990, resulting in almost daily 
public demonstrations. 
  The recommendations caused a furore among Hong Kong's 
political activists and legislators. Prominent activist and 
United Democrats legislator Lau Chin-shek said the decision was 
indicative of Beijing's intention to clamp down on activists 
after 1997. Independent legislator Anna Wu said: "The move 
reflects that Beijing is cautious about political groups and 
would like to hinder basic freedoms in Hong Kong (after 1997)." 
Independent legislator Emily Lau warned the move could create 
"legal chaos".

  [Text] Journalist Xi Yang has won an award far the reports 
which led to him being jailed by China for 12 years. 
  Xi and three colleagues at Ming Pao took the Newspaper 
Society of Hong Kong prize for the best business story in a 
Chinese publication. 
  Their entry was a series of reports on China's 
macro-economic 
control. After the articles appeared in June and July last 
year, Xi was arrested and accused of"spying on and stealing 
state secrets". 
  One of the adjudicators of the awards, To Yiu-ming, of the 
Hong Kong Baptist College Journalism Department, said Xi won the 
award for the outstanding reporting he did in the series. 
  "Xi and his colleagues have chosen a very hot topic of great 
impact to the Chinese economy. They managed to come up with 
several scoops while presenting a comprehensive picture of the 
financial situation in China." 
  He said the granting of the award had nothing to do with the 
Government's jailing of Xi. 
  "But it does reflect the irony that things that we honour in 
our society are regarded as a crime by Chinese authorities," he 
said. 
  Executive Chief Editor of Ming Pao, Paul Cheung Kin-por, 
said: "The award confirmed the hard work of Xi Yang and his 
colleagues. 
  "But we also feel sorry about what happened to Xi, after all 
he did what a reporter is supposed to do." 
  Mr Cheung said the paper would tell Xi's father, Xi 
Linsheng, 
about the award.

  [Text] Beijing, June 22 (CNS) -- The Director of the Hong 
Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the State Council of China 
was interviewed by deputy-chief of the international affairs 
department of the WALL STREET JOURNAL yesterday. He expounded 
China's stance on negotiations on issues of the new airport, No. 
9 Wharf project, the legislative election of the future Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region, choice of the Chief 
Executive and the press freedom in Hong Kong after 1997. 
  With respect to the Sino-British negotiations on the new 
airport of Hong Kong which had attracted broad attention, Mr. Lu 
said the Chinese side had been always hoping to solve the issue 
of the new airport of Hong Kong as early as possible through the 
Sino-British negotiations. Since liabilities left for the 
future government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
by the Hong Kong authorities in its financial budget for the new 
airport greatly surpassed HK$5 billion [Hong Kong dollars], a 
solution to this issue was yet to be reached. The Hong Kong 
authorities now expressed to increase investment in the new 
airport project, thus making it possible to reduce liabilities 
to be left for the future government of the region. Therefore, 
the issue of the new airport could be expected to be settled 
soon. But settlement of this problem depended on the British 
side's cooperative stance and actual move. 
  When talking on the issue of the legislative election of 
Hong 
Kong, Mr. Lu stressed again the Chinese side advocated an 
"orderly and gradual" democratic electoral method with an aim of 
realization of the smooth transition as well as maintaining 
stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. 
  As for the issue of what are characteristics qualified for 
the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region apart from those requirements stipulated in the Basic 
Law, Mr. Lu answered the candidate for such a post would be 
required to have administrative management experience, to enjoy 
a high reputation among the Hong Kong residents and be 
acceptable to the majority. The Chief Executive should be 
elected by the Hong Kong residents in accordance with the Basic 
Law. 
  With regard to the press freedom of Hong Kong after 1997, 
Mr. 
Lu said the Basic Law had relevant provision about this issue 
and what was common practice today would still be practiced 
after 1997. It was impossible to imagine that all six million 
Hong Kong residents were in favor of socialism. On the 
contrary, the majority of Hong Kong residents were probably not 
for socialism. However, he said, he believed that most of the 
Hong Kong residents would be surely in favor of "one China, two 
systems". The Hong Kong residents may express their own 
opinions freely, but it would be impermissible for any one to 
take actions trying to use Hong Kong as a basis to subvert the 
Chinese government.

<F P=106> [By political correspondent Sally Blyth and Rain Ren] </F>
  [Text] In a final act of brinkmanship, Britain has 
declared to China its bottom line on the future of the military 
sites. It is believed that Britain has informed China that if 
no agreement is reached officially by early July, Britain cannot 
guarantee that all military facilities would be ready for 
handover by July 1, 1997. 
  Hopes of reaching an overall agreement on defence sites will 
rapidly fade unless China accepts Britain's position at this 
morning's meeting. 
  Britain's bottom line includes two contentious points that 
remain unresolved despite protracted negotiations: A limit on 
the size of the Stonecutters Island naval base and the number of 
military residential blocks to be handed over to China. It is 
understood that Britain told China of its position on both 
issues at yesterday's plenary session of the Joint Liaison Group 
(JLG). 
  China has insisted on a much larger naval base and 
complained 
that Britain was willing to hand over only 30 percent of the 
residential blocks available. 
  Britain had hoped an agreement could be reached this morning 
by the expert team, in time to be endorsed by the plenary 
session. Britain's timetable is for the Hong Kong Government to 
apply for the funding necessary for redeveloping these military 
sites at the last Legislative Council finance committee meeting 
of the political calendar on July 15. A JLG agreement will have 
to be reached soon to allow enough time between now and mid-July 
to prepare the necessary papers on funding for committee members. 
  The funding will be essential for the redevelopment of 
military hospitals and refurbishment of a number of buildings at 
some military sites, as well as the expansion of the 
Stonecutters Island naval base before 1997. This will take time 
to complete. Further land reclamation works on Stonecutters 
Island, for example, will take at least three months. 
  China has agreed to hand over any military sites not used by 
the military to the future Special Administrative Region 
government. 
  The expert team talks on the military sites have been 
conducted simultaneously with the JLG plenary session, which is 
due to end today. 
  At yesterday's meeting, both sides failed to agree on right 
of abode for returning Hong Kong migrants. Britain has also 
failed to secure China's agreement on the construction of the 
much-delayed Container Terminal Nine (CT9). The granting of CT9 
development rights is one of the main issues on the JLG agenda. 
  Guo Fengmin, the head of the Chinese JLG team, said China 
would not agree on the terminal until Hong Kong people had been 
consulted. China has insisted that the terminal must be built in 
a cost-effective way. 
  If no agreement on defence lands is made this morning, it is 
expected that both sides will announce agreements on a number of 
multilateral treaties affecting the economy and trade. 
  Meanwhile, the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office, Lu Ping, has said an agreement on airport financing 
could come as early as the end of this month. In an interview 
with the ASIAN WALL STREET JOURNAL published yesterday, Lu was 
quoted as saying China would accept debts for the airport far 
above the HK$5 billion limit once insisted upon and contained in 
the Memorandum of Understanding. Lu's comments are the 
strongest signal of support from China so far on the latest 
airport financing proposal.

  [Text] China is prepared to accept government borrowing 
"far above" the $5 billion ceiling stipulated in the 1991 
Sino-British Agreement in an effort to strike an early deal on 
Hong Kong's new airport, according to a senior Chinese official. 
Lu Ping struck yet another positive note on the stalled airport 
talks just two days before the Airport Committee starts another 
round of negotiation on Chek Lap Kok's financial package. 
  Speaking in the Legislative Council, Financial Secretary Sir 
Hamish Macleod said the Government hoped good progress would be 
made at the talks tomorrow. 
  Mr Lu, director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, said he hoped a decision on the airport would be 
reached by the end of next week. But that would only be 
possible if Britain co-operated, he said in an interview with 
the ASIAN WALL STREET JOURNAL published yesterday. 
  Under the latest financial package, the Government will put 
$60.3 billion into the Mass Transit Railway Corporation and the 
Provisional Airport Authority. The amount of borrowing, 
however, would still be around $20 billion. . 
  Under the 1991 deal or Memorandum of Understanding, the 
government can only proceed with borrowing in excess of $5 
billion if China agrees. Mr Lu said China was prepared to 
accept a debt ceiling substantially above $5 billion but 
declined to give a figure. "It's still far above five... Yes, 
I have said we are very flexible," he said. 
  Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten said Mr Lu's remarks were 
"positive and constructive." "I very much hope that we'll see 
an increasingly good and cooperative relationship with China and 
it's obviously in the interests of Hong Kong. I hope that both 
of us will be able to see the words we used about cooperation 
turned into real practical successes in the work of the Joint 
Liaison Group and elsewhere too. I think people in Hong Kong 
want to see actions as well as hear words," he said. 
  Mr Patten said he would like to see a decisive breakthrough 
at the meeting of the Airport Committee tomorrow, adding that no 
one should "count the eggs before they are hatched". 
  An overall financing agreement would speed up the 
construction of the airport, he said.

  [Text] Hong Kong, June 22 (XINHUA) -- The Board of 
Directors of Bank of China (BOC) has appointed Yang Zilin chief 
executive of its Hong Kong and Macau regional office to replace 
his predecessor Huang Diyan. 
  The news was announced by BOC's President Wang Xuebing at a 
reception held here today at the Bank of China Tower to 
introduce the newly-appointed head of the bank's regional office. 
  According to Wang, Huang Diyan will remain as an advisor to 
the regional office after his retirement from the post which he 
took up in 1985. 
  As BOC's managing director, Yang Zilin was an assistant 
president of the bank's head office prior to his present 
appointment. 
  Yang has had a long service with BOC. Before his appointment 
as the bank's assistant president, he was the general manager of 
the bank's head office administrative department and the Tokyo 
branch respectively. 
  "His performance at both offices were excellent," said Wang 
Xuebing while introducing Yang at the reception. 
  Wang believed that Yang will continue to make use of his 
talent to facilitate the future development of the Hongkong 
[HK]-based Bank of China group and to strengthen the friendly 
cooperation with the banking community and friends in other 
sectors. 
  "I am positive that the Bank of China group, based on past 
achievements and under the new leadership, will continue to work 
in cooperation with the financial and other circles for the 
prosperity and stability of the region and for building up a 
better tomorrow," Wang said. 
  At today's reception, Wang also expressed his heartfelt 
thanks to Huang Diyan on behalf of the Bank of China head office 
for his endeavours to the development of the Bank of China group 
over the years. 
  More than 100 business leaders and public figures in the 
territory attended today's event. 
  It is also learned at today's reception that the Bank of 
China group has decided to donate eight million H.K. dollars 
(slightly over one million U.S. dollars) to the people in the 
flooding areas of southern China.

<F P=106> [Second installment in a series of articles by Huang </F>
Wenfang, a former offcial with XINHUA News Agency's Hong Kong 
Branch who retired from XINHUA in 1992 and now lives in Hong 
Kong] 
  [Text] It is a news agency--or that is its title. But 
within the Hong Kong headquarters of the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY 
(XINHUA), the news department is known as the "mini branch". 
Housed in a tiny section on Sharp Street West, it is the only 
area from which XINHUA actually handles news and wire services. 
The other 16 departments and offices on Queen's Road East are 
for more pertinent use. The territory's branch of XINHUA is 
composed of 22 sections: 12 departments, four offices, three 
district offices and three offices on the mainland. Strictly 
speaking, the three district offices are not part of the Hong 
Kong Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, but in Queen's 
Road East, the committee controls not only XINHUA, but other 
units in Hong Kong. 
  We sum up the structure as "four major lines". The first 
line is the banking system, meaning the financial committee, 
with the Bank of China as its centre; second is the trade 
committee, with China Resources as its pulse; third is the 
transport committee, built around China Merchants, and fourth is 
a committee handling overseas Chinese affairs. 
  Originally, the heads of these four lines were members of 
the 
Hong Kong committee, but this was scrapped in the mid-1980s. 
With the reform many mainland organisations began sending 
people to Hong Kong. 
  Economic units all come under the control of XINHUA, 
although 
they no longer take part in the work of the Hong Kong committee. 
They are also controlled by their Beijing bosses, giving rise to 
the phrase "two kinds of leaders". This means their day-to-day 
business comes under the control of Beijing, and XINHUA, for the 
most part, does not interfere. But anything relating to Hong 
Kong decisions, policies or the deployment of cadres is handled 
by XINHUA. 
  XINHUA has always been controlled by the Central Committee 
of 
the Chinese Communist Party, but the specific responsibility of 
each central committee member has changed from time to time. 
From the 1950s onwards, the central committee had a Hong Kong 
and Macao leading group with Zhou Enlai as head. Chen Yi was 
the first deputy head and Liao Chengzhi the second deputy. 
  XINHUA came under the leadership of this group. Among what 
we called "Zhou-Chen-Liao", it was Liao who had the most 
full-time and specific tasks. He often sought instructions from 
Zhou, and, on matters of importance, would ask Mao Zedong. Zhou 
was directly in charge of Hong Kong work right up to his death 
in 1976. Chen also died during the Cultural Revolution. After 
the revolution, new appointments were made. Geng Biao became 
the new head, with Chen Muhua and Liao Chengzhi as deputies. 
  In fact, the leading group never functioned after this. The 
moment appointments were announced, Geng and Chen said they 
could not handle the job because they were not familiar with 
Hong Kong. This meant Liao continued to handle Hong Kong by 
himself. So this new leading group was dead as soon as it was 
born. It never held a single meeting. From the time the party 
central office decided to take back sovereignty over Hong Kong 
in mid-December, 1981, to the time a draft policy plan was 
completed in the first half of 1982, neither Geng nor Chen took 
part in any stage of the process. 
  At the time, Geng was a politburo member and Minister of 
Defence, and Chen an alternate member of the politburo and 
Minister of Foreign Trade. Liao was a central committee member, 
as well as heading the newly established Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office of the State Council. 
  It was not until the end of 1981 that then party general 
secretary, Hu Yaobang, clearly stated: "The party central 
committee has entrusted Liao Chengzhi to handle the three piles" 
-- that is, work regarding Hong Kong and Macao, Taiwan, and 
overseas Chinese. After Liao died in 1983, the central committee 
entrusted three people to handle these jobs: Ji Pengfei on Hong 
Kong and Macao work, Yang Shangkun on Taiwan and Wu Xueqian on 
the overseas Chinese department. Thus, both Liao and Ji had 
held two posts at once. They did not do Hong Kong work as the 
director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, but rather 
as the leader entrusted with this work by the central committee. 
  The present director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office, Lu Ping, has never been entrusted by the central 
committee to handle Hong Kong work. Since the retirement of Ji, 
that job has been handled by the General Secretary, Jiang Zemin, 
and Premier, Li Peng. The Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, as a 
politburo member, handles foreign affairs, Hong Kong and Macao, 
and Taiwan. As the assistant of Jiang and Li, Qian helps with 
Hong Kong. 
  So Jiang and Li are the highest power holders in respect to 
Hong Kong. Right now, matters of great importance concerning 
Hong Kong are first reported to Qian, then Jiang and Li are 
asked for advice. 
  Jiang and Li divide Hong Kong work between them: Li handles 
most jobs concerning government departments, while Jiang handles 
party affairs and decisions concerning the overall situation. 
It can be said that Jiang handles more than Li. 
  The so-called "three horse carriage", often referred to by 
the Hong Kong media, translates as XINHUA, the State Council's 
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, and the Hong Kong and Macao 
desk of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This view is incorrect. 
  The Hong Kong and Macao desk of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs exists only at ministerial-level, equivalent to one 
level below a single department in XINHUA. So, XINHUA and the 
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office are of equal status, both at 
ministerial level. Neither has leadership over the other. 
XINHUA is a top level overseas post of the Chinese Communist 
Party, while the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office is an office 
of the State Council for handling Hong Kong and Macao work. 
  In most cases, when there is an important decision to be 
made 
about Hong Kong policy, XINHUA and the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office meet. If the subject concerns Sino-British 
relations, someone from the Foreign Ministry will join the 
meeting. If it concerns economic matters, people from the 
relevant economic departments will be there. 
  So the best way to characterise leadership over Hong Kong 
work is that it is handled by Jiang, Li and Qian.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Abandon Confrontation, Resume Negotiations"] </F>
  [Text] On 12 June, a spokesman for the British Foreign 
Office revealed to the press in Hong Kong that British Foreign 
Office Minister Alastair Goodlad would visit China in July. He 
said that the details of Goodlad's visit would be made public in 
late June and would not be revealed at the present stage. 
  Before the relevant diplomatic consultations had been 
completed, the British side became too impatient to wait any 
longer and disclosed this information. Moreover, it stressed 
that Goodlad would limit his discussions to Sino-British 
relations, including business cooperation and cooperation on 
international affairs, but would not talk about the Hong Kong 
issue. 
  People with a discerning eye could see that British 
businessmen were unhappy with the state of Sino-British 
relations, and some members in both chambers of the British 
Parliament have openly criticized the current China policy 
pursued by the British Government. All other industrial 
countries have attached great importance to the giant China 
market, have successively increased their economic and trade 
cooperation with China, and have been pursuing a friendly and 
cooperative diplomatic policy toward China. Even the United 
States, the leading Western country, has adjusted its policy on 
MFN and the human rights issue and has made efforts to expand 
its economic and trade exchanges and develop the China market. 
The exchange of visits by vice premiers and ministers was 
arranged; however, Britain does not have much bargaining power 
in its relations with China. 
  Britain has been pursuing a policy of confrontation. In 
particular, after Patten dished out the "three violation" 
political reform package in Hong Kong, Britain disregarded the 
"consultation and cooperation" principle stipulated in Annex II 
of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, broke the confidentiality 
principle regarding its diplomatic contacts, and violated the 
understanding that no unilateral action with effects extending 
beyond 1997 could be taken before agreement was reached through 
diplomatic channels. Patten also alleged that "secret diplomacy 
and agreement" were gone forever. The British side launched 
opinion and propaganda offensives launched and used television, 
radio, and newspapers to propagate Patten's scheme. They 
continued to act perversely and willfully and had no scruples 
about terminating the talks and making the political structure 
different from that designed by China for the post-1997 period. 
In pursuing this confrontational policy, the British 
authorities flagrantly played the "international card." They 
thought that, if other Western countries supported them, they 
might be able to intimidate China. The situation, however, did 
not develop as Britain expected. The Western industrial 
countries, including the United States, all attached importance 
to their own economic interests, and were not willing to be 
Britain's pawn. Thus, Britain's "international card" was not 
supported by other Western countries, and Britain found it 
difficult to continue to pursue the policy of isolating China by 
itself. This policy would only end up isolating Britain. 
  After Clinton announced that MFN would no longer be linked 
to 
human rights on 26 May, Britain found that the situation had 
become extremely unfavorable and it also hastily changed its 
position and tried to warm up its relations with China. It then 
decided to proceed from the low-level contacts at the vice 
minister level, but this was not a bad thing. 
  It was prudent not to announce the agenda beforehand and 
even 
to say that the visit will not be related to the Hong Kong 
issue. This may leave more leeway and may enable both sides to 
move onto the course of quiet diplomacy. In the past, megaphone 
diplomacy only played into the hands of some politicians and 
enabled them to put on political shows to serve their selfish 
calculations; such a practice was certainly detrimental to the 
resolution of problems. It only served to completely destroy 
the foundation for mutual trust and diplomatic cooperation. The 
Foreign Office is certainly the organ in the British Government 
that is in charge of relations with China. If Britain is 
sincerity about conducting a diplomatic dialogue with China and 
solving problems between the two countries through 
consultations, China is naturally willing to maintain contracts 
through diplomatic channels. The Joint Declaration explicitly 
stipulates the channels and forms of contacts between the 
Chinese and British Governments. So, if the British side is 
willing to follow the consultation channels specified in the 
Joint Declaration, China certainly welcomes this. 
  The first of these channels is the Sino-British Joint 
Liaison 
Group, and the second is diplomatic consultations between the 
two governments. Certain changes have indeed occurred, and both 
sides have become more willing to conduct consultations more 
positively. The discussions on the issues of military land, 
localization of laws, the court of final appeal, and the Special 
Administrative Region passports have all made certain progress. 
The holding of a Joint Liaison Group meeting on 21 June also 
showed that some issues had moved closer to resolution. The 
British side has now also adopted a more realistic attitude 
toward the airport financial issue. As the Chinese side did not 
raise any objections, it seems that an agreement will be reached 
soon. 
  Some press reports have pointed out that the controversy 
over the political structure has become a thing of the "past." 
If this reflects the opinion of the British side, then it will 
not help the thaw in Sino-British relations. The breakdown of 
the talks on the political structure was caused by the British 
side, and the consequences cannot be undone. The three-tier 
councils in Hong Kong must be reorganized in 1997. However, it 
seems that the British side is still trying to move even further 
away on the political structure issue. Some people are now 
calling for direct elections arrangements which deviate more 
radically from the Basic Law; some people are calling for 
revising more laws in Hong Kong; and some people are even trying 
to shake the executive-led government structure... All this 
shows that some people have never given up the confrontational 
policy. The breakdown of the talks on the political structure 
is indeed an event of the past, but the dispute over the 
political structure has not come to an end. The fundamental 
reason lies in the fact that the British side still refuses to 
give up its "three violation" position. Recently, some people 
in the British Hong Kong authorities continued to insist that 
China cannot reorganize the three-level council structure built 
up unilaterally by the British side. This proves that the 
dispute over the political structure has not yet come to an end. 
Moreover, these remarks in fact foreshadow the future 
development of the dispute. If the British side really wants to 
cooperate, it must improve its deeds and attitudes to 
demonstrate its sincerity. If a benign cooperation atmosphere 
can be created before Goodlad visits China, then he may not 
return home empty-handed after his trip in July.

  [Text] Hong Kong, former Foreign Secretary Lord Howe 
observed on a recent visit, is a "magnificent living plant." It 
is an organic, changing society, which has continued to develop 
since he negotiated the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and 
set the seal on the territory's return to Chinese control. Yet 
some members of China's Hong Kong transition team, the 
Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), seem to assume the 
territory's legal, political, and social development should have 
been frozen at the moment the treaty was signed and to regard 
any changes that have taken place since as a breach of the 
agreement. 
  The PWC Legal Affairs Subgroup, however, is made up of 
experienced lawyers and should be a forum where such opinions 
are out of fashion. That they are not tells us much more work 
has to go into persuading some Chinese officials and pro-China 
figures here that the territory has changed over the past 10 
years and its laws can, and should, reflect the changes. 
  Shao Tianren, the group's mainland co-convenor, and his 
local 
counterpart, former Appeals Court judge Simon Li Fook-sean, have 
warned that planned amendments to the Public Order Ordinance and 
the Societies Ordinance, aimed at relaxing controls on freedom 
of assembly and the ban on links to organisations overseas, 
would violate the Joint Declaration's provision that "the laws 
currently in force in Hong Kong will remain basically unchanged". 
  Article 3 (3) of the Joint Declaration, from which that 
phrase is taken, was not intended to embalm the body of Hong 
Kong law exactly as it stood in December 1984. On the contrary, 
Article 3 sets out the basic policies of the People's Republic 
of China for the Special Administrative Region (SAR). It should 
be clear that the agreement to leave the laws basically 
unchanged applies to laws currently in force at the time of the 
creation of the SAR on July 1, 1997. The article is intended to 
reassure the people of Hong Kong that China has given legal 
backing to its promise that their way of life will continue 
after 1997. 
  The PWC is on stronger ground if it argues that the 
government's proposals relaxing the Societies Ordinance are in 
conflict with the Basic Law. Article 23, introduced as an 
afterthought into the second draft in the light of Hong Kong's 
strong reaction to the June 4, 1989, crackdown on the Chinese 
democracy movement, bans subversion against the Central People's 
Government, prohibits foreign political organisations, and bans 
local political groups from establishing links with foreign 
organisations. It is harder to attack the revisions to the 
Public Order Ordinance, since the Basic Law guarantees "freedom 
of association, of assembly, of procession, and of 
demonstration." 
  It is for the SAR government to decide if the changes that 
have taken place before its establishment should be reversed to 
conform with the Basic Law. But it will have to reflect, as the 
PWC should be reflecting today, that the changes in Hong Kong 
society are not imposed from the outside by the British 
administration but have often been forced from the 
administration with great reluctance in response to organic 
changes within society. Hong Kong did not begin to change with 
the arrival of Chris Patten but long before. That development 
was recognised and encouraged by the Joint Declaration, which 
called for the legislature to be constituted by elections and 
guaranteed the same freedoms later enshrined in the Basic Law. 
China seems to have begun to regret those enlightened and 
farsighted policies in 1989. But it is in Beijing's interests, 
and Hong Kong's, to return to the views that helped shape the 
Joint Declaration.

  [Text] Taipei, June 23 (CNA) -- Taiwan's trade deficit 
with Europe reached an all-time high of US$959 million during 
the first five months of this year, according to statistics 
released by the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) Thursday [23 June]. 
  BOFT officials attributed the surging deficit to the 
lessened 
competitiveness of made-in-Taiwan products on the European 
market. 
  During the January-May period, Taiwan's exports to Europe 
totaled US$5.335 billion, a decline of 5.6 percent from the 
first five months of 1993. Imports totaled US$6.294 billion, an 
increase of 10.7 percent, the officials said. 
  Among the European countries, Germany remained Taiwan's 
leading trade partner, accounting for 27.5 percent of Taiwan's 
total bilateral trade with Europe. 
  Despite the gradually recovering economy in Europe, Taiwan's 
capital-intensive industries have had trouble penetrating the 
European market, an indication that industrial upgrading here 
has not yet helped the competitiveness of Taiwan products 
overseas. 
  Taiwan's exports to Europe are mainly information products, 
electronic machinery components, bicycles, plastic products, and 
sports equipment.

  [Text] Jakarta, June 21 (CNA) -- Ties between Taiwan and 
Indonesia have improved significantly since President Li 
Teng-hui paid an unofficial visit to Indonesia in February, a 
Taiwan official stationed here said Tuesday [21 June]. 
  Lu Pao-sun, representative of the Taipei Economic and Trade 
Office in Jakarta, noted that Taiwan had invested a total of 
US$8.6 billion in Indonesia as of the end of May, making it the 
second largest foreign investor in the Southeast Asian country. 
  In comparison, he pointed out, aggregate Taiwan investment 
was about US$4 billion as of the end of 1993. It's really 
amazing that investment from Taiwan made such a big jump in the 
five-month period, he said. Annual two-way trade between the 
two countries stands at nearly US$3 billion, he added. 
  Lu made the remarks at a cocktail party in honor of a 
delegation of Taiwan manufacturers taking part in the Jakarta 
fair, which opened last Saturday and will continue through July 
16. 
  The delegation is led by Ronie H.K. Huang, secretary-general 
of the Taipei-based China External Trade Development Council. 
  Stressing that the delegation aims to strengthen trade and 
investment cooperation between the two countries, Huang said he 
has invited Indonesian entrepreneurs to display their products 
at the Taipei import fair, which is scheduled for October. 
  Earlier in the day, Huang called on Commerce Minister 
Joedono 
and Rudy Langkong, chairman of the Export Promotion Commission 
under the Ministry of Commerce. 
  Also speaking at the party, ROC legislator Lin Shou-shan 
said 
the Taipei government has promoted the "southern strategy" in a 
bid to help enhance the economic progress in Southeast Asian 
countries and Taiwan's overseas investment. 
  Taiwan is willing to share its experience in economic 
development with other countries, Lin noted. 
  In return, Langkong extended his welcome to the Taiwan 
delegation, saying that longstanding relations between the two 
countries have been solid despite the lack of diplomatic ties. 
He said that Indonesia will definitely be represented at the 
1994 Taipei import fair.

  [Text] Taipei, June 23 (CNA) -- Republic of China [ROC] 
trade and defense officials will discuss the control of certain 
high-tech exports with their U.S. counterparts when the two 
sides meet for strategic trade consultations in Washington on 
Tuesday [28 June] and Wednesday. 
  Since the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding on 
the protection of trade in strategic commodities -- such as 
computers that can be used for military purposes -- and 
technical data in 1990, they have held regular meetings. 
  The ROC, in the spirit of the memorandum, has mapped out 
regulations governing the export and import of high-tech 
products. One of these requirements is that domestic 
manufacturers must receive approval from the Board of Foreign 
Trade (BOFT) before importing such products. 
  A BOFT official said that the idea of controlling hi-tech 
products first came from the international Coordinating 
Committee for Multilateral Export Control, whose original aim 
was to keep high-tech products from falling into the hands of 
communist countries. With the collapse of communism, however, 
its focus has shifted to keeping such products out of the hands 
of terrorists. 
  The official said that the government is now preparing a 
list 
of high-tech products subject to export control, and it is 
expected that certain information and machinery products would 
be affected.

  [Text] Taipei, June 23 (CNA) -- In an attempt to speed up 
Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 
or GATT, the government is working to further open domestic 
service markets, a ranking government official said Thursday [23 
June]. 
  Hsiao Wan-chang, chairman of the Council for Economic 
Planning and Development (CEPD), noted that the "initial 
commitment list" of service industries will come out by the end 
of this month. 
  The strategy to promote the liberalization of the service 
sector -- a requirement to become a GATT member -- also fit 
into the government's ambition to build Taiwan into an 
Asia-Pacific business- operations center, Hsiao stressed. 
  Taiwan, which has observer status with the Geneva-based 
world 
trade regulating body, is expected to become a full member by 
the end of the year. 
  The CEPD service-liberalization task force has reached a 
preliminary consensus on the service-opening package, Hsiao 
pointed out. 
  He said the government is set to open the import-export 
shipping container trafficking business in accordance with an 
amendment to the highway law, and will relax restrictions on 
foreigners who want to work as tour guides, with the residency 
requirement for a foreign guide being lowered from three years 
to six months. 
  In telecommunications, he said, the government must adjust 
its monopolistic hold over local, long-distance, international, 
and cellular phone services. 
  The value-added network service market will also be open to 
foreigners in a step-by-step approach upon the completion of the 
revised telecommunications law, he said. 
  Moreover, he said, foreign insurance companies will be 
allowed to open branches in Taiwan in line with the revision of 
the guidelines on permits for foreign insurance companies, which 
is expected to be completed by the end of August. Currently, 
only US insurance firms are allowed to operate here. 
  Restrictions on foreign banks' establishing branches will 
also be relaxed. A foreign bank is now allowed to open three 
branches here annually.

  [Text] Taipei, June 23 (CNA) -- A new round of talks 
between the intermediary bodies from the two sides of the Taiwan 
strait may be held in Taipei in mid-July to discuss some 
cross-strait issues, a mainland affairs official said Thursday 
[23 June]. 
  "We have authorized the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) to 
prepare for a working-level meeting with its mainland Chinese 
counterpart as part of our efforts to promote cross-strait 
dialogue and rapprochement," said Kao Koong-lien, vice chairman 
of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC). 
  It will be the fifth working-level meeting between the SEF 
and the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the 
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) since the heads of the two semi-official 
conduits for cross- strait exchanges met in Singapore in April 
1993. 
  The meeting will focus on issues related to the repatriation 
of mainland hijackers and illegal immigrants as well as to 
cross-strait fishing disputes, Kao said. 
  SEF and ARATS officials have met four times to discuss these 
issues since the second half of last year, but no definite 
results have been reached because of Beijing's reluctance to 
recognize Taiwan's jurisdiction over territories now under its 
control. 
  Kao said the fifth round of talks will also discuss ways to 
protect the safety of Taiwan travelers on the mainland. "The 
issue has become pressing after the March 31 Qiandao lake travel 
disaster in which 24 Taiwan tourists were murdered," Kao noted. 
  The meeting will be held after the July 4-5 national meeting 
on mainland affairs, but the exact date has yet to be decided, 
kao said. "We hope it will take place before late July or early 
August," he added. 
  The SEF is expected to inform ARATS of its intention to hold 
the fifth-round working-level meeting in the next few days. 
  Kao said the SEF will also arrange for a meeting between its 
Vice Chairman and Secretary-General, Chiao Jen-ho, and ARATS 
Vice President Tang Shubei in the near future. 
  "The time, venue and agenda for the proposed Chiao-tang 
meeting will be decided after further discussion by SEF and 
ARATS officials," Kao said. 
  He added that he does not rule out the possibility that the 
Chiao-Tang meeting will be held in Taiwan. Chiao and Tang met 
for the first time in Beijing last November. 
  Kao said the Mainland Affairs Council, which oversees SEF 
operations, has never tied the holding of a second Chiao-Tang 
meeting to the satisfactory conclusion of the fifth 
working-level meeting between the two organizations. 
  "We hope the planned Chiao-Tang meeting will help create a 
favorable environment for a new round of talks between SEF 
Chairman C.F. Koo and ARATS President Wang Daohan," Kao noted. 
  He denied that the presidential office has ordered the MAC 
not to approve a Koo-Wang meeting within this year. "We have 
never received any such instruction," he stressed. 
  During the first Koo-Wang meeting, several agreements were 
signed to lay a framework for institutionalized dialogue and 
communications between the SEF and ARATS. 
  As cross-strait relations have plunged to a low ebb in the 
aftermath of the Qiandao lake tragedy, Kao said Taiwan hopes to 
create a better atmosphere before a second Koo-Wang meeting 
takes place.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yin Nai-hsin (1438 0035 7451)] </F>
  [Text] The Mainland Affairs Commission [MAC] yesterday 
approved the proposal of the Ministry of Education to stop, 
beginning 1 July, accepting applications for allowing 
non-cultural and educational personnel from the mainland to 
visit Taiwan to engage in cultural and educational activities 
and to strictly control cross-strait cultural and educational 
exchanges to be held in Taiwan by closely screening their 
sponsors and the nature of the activities. The visit to Taiwan 
by non-cultural and non-educational figures will be allowed only 
after responsible government agencies have enacted relevant 
regulations governing the approval of their applications. 
  At the present stage, the action described above will be 
interpreted as a measure in disguise to tighten control. In the 
past, administrative agencies took a more liberal attitude in 
examining reasons for the mainlanders' visits to Taiwan to 
engage in cultural and educational activities and in determining 
their status. This has enabled mainlanders in official positions 
who have worked in economic, trade, industrial, and business 
circles to visit Taiwan. However, after 1 July, the Ministry of 
Education will only accept the applications of mainland 
personnel in cultural and educational circles to engage in 
educational, sports, cultural, arts, and science and technology 
activities that are sponsored by schools, research institutions, 
and academic societies. Personnel in other specialized fields 
can apply for visits to Taiwan only after government agencies 
have enacted measures for approving their applications. 
  In our administrative talks with the mainland, the question 
of visits by mainland economic and trade personnel to Taiwan has 
consistently been used as a bargaining chip, and this has 
delayed approval of the measures drafted by the Ministry of 
Economic Affairs governing visits by people from the mainland's 
economic and trade circles. The MAC meeting's approval of the 
Ministry of Education's proposal at this time will block for the 
time being the route used by mainland economic and trade 
personnel in official positions to visit Taiwan. Whether this 
has anything to do with the aftermath of the Chientao Lake 
[Qiandaohu] case on cross-strait relations is worth pondering. 
  After the MAC meeting, MAC Vice Chairman Kao Kung-lien said 
that the government has been too relaxed in its control, adding 
that the government has never specifically allowed non-cultural 
and non- educational personnel to visit Taiwan for cultural and 
educational activities. According to statistics, only one third 
of the mainlanders who were approved by the Ministry of 
Education to visit Taiwan were directly involved in academic 
activities in the strict sense of the word; the rest have 
nothing to do with cultural and educational activities at all. 
  We have sponsored many cross-strait symposiums -- including 
those on steel production, communications, and tourism -- based 
on the measures governing the approval of applications for 
people from the mainland to visit Taiwan to engage in cultural 
and educational activities. Personnel in charge of the 
mainland's state-run enterprises, including those from the 
Shoutu [Shoudu] Iron and Steel Corporation, airline companies, 
and Youth Tourist Service, have visited Taiwan. 
  Kao Kung-lien pointed out: Last June, the government 
promulgated measures governing the approval of applications for 
people on the mainland to visit Taiwan. Since then, with the 
exception of those who came to visit their relatives and attend 
their funerals, all others have come based on measures governing 
approval of applications for cultural and educational exchanges. 
It is easy to handle applications for educational, cultural, 
sports, and arts exchange, because they are easy to identify. 
The Ministry of Education, however, has a hard time examining 
non-academic activities involving finance, banking, and 
economics. The ministry last year asked other government 
agencies to enact measures for the approval of applications for 
mainland personnel in different categories to visit Taiwan, but 
the agencies have not come up with the measures yet. 
  It was pointed out that the following measures on visits by 
mainlanders in specialized fields have been drafted on the basis 
of regulations governing relations between people on two sides 
of the Taiwan Strait and are in the process of being examined 
and approved: measures on visits by economic and trade personnel 
(Ministry of Economic Affairs), by agricultural personnel 
(Council of Agriculture), and by communications personnel 
(Ministry of Communications). Measures concerning visits by 
physicians and by financial, construction, and environmental 
protection personnel are also being considered.

  [Text] Taipei, June 22 (CNA) -- The Central Bank of China 
(CBC) may have to tighten up its credit policy to cope with the 
changing international economic situation, an economic planner 
said Wednesday [22 June]. 
  "Sharp rises in international oil and commodity prices in 
recent weeks have inflicted increasing inflationary pressure on 
Taiwan," said K.C. Li, a department director at the Council for 
Economic Planning and Development. 
  Chinese Petroleum Corp., a state monopoly, is considering 
raising prices for its products by an average of 3 percent in 
July because its crude oil import cost has risen to US$16 per 
barrel, exceeding its original estimate of US$14.50. 
  Li said the proposed oil price hike may trigger a wave of 
adjustments of prices for many other products and services. 
  In addition, the nearly 2 percent depreciation of the new 
Taiwan dollar against the U.S. greenback over the past few 
months has added up to domestic inflationary pressure, Li noted. 
  The consumer price index grew at an annual rate of 4.33 
percent in May, far exceeding the government-set 3.5 percent 
ceiling, and the import price index grew 5.07 percent -- a 
three-year high. 
  If the trend continues, Li said, the domestic inflation rate 
will far surpass the 3.5 percent ceiling for the year. 
  The oil and commodity price surges, coupled with the 
weakening of the U.S. dollar, have triggered panic selling in 
major world stock markets in recent days as stock dealers react 
to the fear that mounting inflation may hinder the global 
economic recovery. 
  In reaction to the bearish mood of international bourses, 
the 
Taiwan stock exchange's weighted price index, the market's key 
barometer, has fallen below the psychologically important 6.000- 
point barrier. Panic selling has also been seen in the local 
bond market, pushing up government bond yields drastically in 
the past few days. 
  Against this background, Li said, the central bank must 
decide whether to continue its current easy credit policy to 
maintain moderate economic growth or to tighten its monetary 
policy to maintain domestic price stability. 
  The central bank adopted an easy credit policy last July 
with 
a view to stimulating private investment and boosting economic 
growth. 
  CBC officials said they are keeping close watch on recent 
trends in major world financial markets. "We won't lightly 
adjust our credit policy before making a careful, comprehensive 
review of economic situations at home and abroad," said a CBC 
official, who requested anonymity. 
  CBC Governor Liang Kuo-shu said recently that the bank's top 
consideration in formulating monetary policy is to maintain 
price stability.

  [Text] Chairman Hsiao Wan-chang of the Council for 
Economic Planning and Development yesterday briefed Premier Lien 
Chan on the progress of carrying out a plan for invigorating the 
economy. According to Hsiao Wan-chang, the plan has achieved 
success in promoting investment by the private sector. He said 
that economic growth is expected to increase to 6.3 percent in 
the second half of 1994. 
  The data presented by Hsiao Wan-chang yesterday show that 
the 
plan has played its role in bringing the economic growth rate 
within the target area. The achievements include: 
  1. Major investment plans have increased by a large margin. 
During the period between July 1991 and April 1994, 54 major 
investment plans have been filed with the Ministry of Economic 
Affairs, with each plan involving more than NT$ [New Taiwan 
dollars] 200 million. The total investment amount in this 
period is estimated at NT$254.9 billion. There will be 93 major 
investment plans in 1994, with a total investment amount of 
NT$146.9 billion, an increase of 54 percent over 1993. These 
figures demonstrate that the economic plan has achieved success 
in promoting investment by the private sector. 
  2. The rate of investment by the private sector has returned 
to the target area. In the second half of 1993, investment by 
the private sector increased by 9.2 percent. Invigorated by the 
plan, the private sector increase its investments by 18.7 
percent in the first quarter of this year. It is estimated that 
the investment growth rate will reach 14.5 percent in the second 
quarter of this year, thus achieving the goal of the plan, which 
calls for a 10-15 percent increase in investment by the private 
sectors in three years. 
  3. The economic situation will take a turn for the better in 
the second half of 1994. The economic growth rates for the 
second half of 1993 and the first half of 1994 are 5.5 percent 
and (an estimated) 5.6 percent respectively, slightly less than 
the targeted growth rate of 6-7 percent. Lackluster exports 
could be attributed to the failure to reach this goal. But it 
is expected that the economic growth rate will improve to 6.3 
percent in the second half of 1994. 
  4. The trend toward industrial upgrading continues. In the 
manufacturing sector, the capital- and technology-intensive 
heavy industries have continuously increased production. In the 
first quarter of this year, the output value of heavy industry 
represents 62.3 percent of the entire manufacturing sector, up 
from 60.8 percent in the same period last year. In the 
January-May period of this year, petrochemical industry exports 
accounts for 53.6 percent of total industrial exports, up from 
51.2 percent in same period last year. The plan has achieved 
its strategic goal of upgrading industry. 
  5. Productivity has increased. In line with the plan for 
effectively increasing productivity, labor productivity in the 
first quarter of this year increased by 4.2 percent over the 
same period last year. 
  Since the introduction of the plan in July last year, the 
domestic economy has experienced a slow recovery. On top of 
that, enterprises have had a hard time acquiring land for their 
plants. As a result, the plan has met with frequent criticism. 
Li Kao-chao, director of the Economic Research Department of 
the Council for Economic Planning and Development, said: Such a 
plan does not aim to stimulate an economic recovery but rather 
to serve as a medium- and long-term plan for improving the 
domestic investment environment. It takes a longer period of 
time to judge the effectiveness of the plan. It is not fair to 
criticize the plan based only on the figures for the first and 
second quarters.

  [Text] Beijing, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Since the early 1980s, 
the Ministry of Communications has used loans of about 2.5 
billion U.S. dollars from the World Bank and the Asian 
Development Bank, as well as 290 billion Japanese yen from the 
Japanese Government, to construct communications infrastructures. 
  Huang Zhendong, minister of communications, said in a press 
conference today that China has used foreign capital to 
construct a host of docks in the ports of Shanghai, Tianjin, 
Guangzhou, Qinhuangdao, Rizhao, Lianyungang and Qingdao, 
increasing the handling capacity by 43 million tons. 
  Twenty-three provinces, autonomous regions and 
municipalities 
have used or are going to use loans from international financial 
institutions or foreign governments to construct 7,000 km of 
highways. 
  Besides, direct investment in highway or port 
infrastructures 
by foreign business people has also advanced considerably, he 
said. 
  As for opening to the outside world, Huang said, by the end 
of 1993 China's water transport ports open to foreign vessels 
had grown to 107 in number, and 35 highway transport ports are 
now open to foreign vehicles from neighboring countries. 
  In addition, China has signed maritime agreements with 43 
countries and signed governmental road transport agreements with 
eight countries; 577 joint ventures in highway transportation 
and water transport businesses and vehicle services have been 
approved, of which 415 are in the road transport sector, 66 in 
automobile services, and 96 in water transportation. 
  Huang said that his ministry will take advantage of all 
favorable opportunities and provide a list of infrastructure 
projects with high economic returns to attract foreign capital, 
adhering to state industrial development policies to solve the 
problem of inadequate investment. 
  He said that there are good prospects for the communications 
sector's use of foreign funds. Guangdong province alone has 
signed letters of intent on the use of 3.5 billion U.S. dollars 
in foreign funds.

  [Text] Beijing, 21 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- While 
gradually removing price controls where appropriate over the 
next few years, China will continue to exercise direct state 
control over the prices of five types of commodities and 
services. 
  The five types of commodities and services are: 
  Less competitive commodities that have a great bearing on 
social stability and on the long-term development of the 
national economy, such as crude oil, natural gas, and a few rare 
metals; 
  Commodities whose prices are strictly controlled by the 
government including some medicines and weapons; 
  Living quarters offered to civil servants and low-income 
earners; 
  Utilities where competition is inappropriate, such as public 
transport, urban water and gas supplies, electricity for general 
and production purposes, rail passenger and freight transport, 
the mail service, and telecommunications; 
  Major facilities and services such as various types of 
social 
public insurance, public education, and health care.

<F P=106> [Interview with Zhong Pengrong, director and researcher of </F>
the Beijing Jinsida Economic Planning Center, by staff reporter 
Gao Shangang (7559 0810 4993); place and date not given: 
"Curbing Inflation Requires Quicker Reform--Interview With 
Young Economist Zhong Pengrong"] 
  [Text] Zhong Pengrong, 39, is now director and researcher 
of the Beijing Jinsida Economic Planning Center. In 1987, he 
published an article "Reforming the Investment Structure 
According to the Requirements of the Commodity Economy" in 
JINGJI RIBAO, and his opinions attracted the attention of the 
central leaders. He was later transferred to the Central 
General Office to do investigation and research work. In 1992, 
he published an article "Socialism Also Needs the Market 
Economy" (written jointly with Chen Jinyu) in JINGJI RIBAO. The 
article was reprinted by RENMIN RIBAO and dozens of national 
newspapers. So far, he has published more than 10 books, 
including "Studies of Inflation in China" and "On 
Macroeconomics," and more than 200 treatises. Recently, his 
book "100 Major National Policies" was published by the People's 
Publishing House. 
  [Gao] Price hikes have become an issue which concerns many 
people. What is your opinion about the fundamental cause of 
price increases in our country? 
  [Zhong] The price increases have been caused by an excessive 
amount of currency in circulation, which in turn has resulted 
from excessive loans. Therefore, in order to control commodity 
prices, efforts should primarily be made to restrain credit and 
limit the amount of currency in circulation. 
  [Gao] Why has the phenomena of excessive credit appeared so 
frequently, and why has it been so difficult for the state to 
bring under control? 
  [Zhong] The fundamental problem is that loans in our country 
are being made almost for free. This finds expression in two 
ways. First, after a loan is made, the borrower may fail to pay 
it back when the debt is due or may never repay it. Second, the 
interest rate for the loans is lower than the inflation rate and 
is also lower than the average market interest rate. The annual 
interest rate of bank loans is around 10 percent, but the 
inflation rate in large and medium-sized cities is over 20 
percent. In some localities, the interest rate of loans given 
by one enterprise to another is as high as 35 percent or more. 
Because of these two factors, enterprises and the local 
government all want to take out as many loans as possible by 
starting new projects. Thus, bank loans have become the most 
precious and scarce of resources. Between 80 and 90 percent of 
the people who come to the provincial capitals or the national 
capital do so for the purpose of obtaining loans. Under strong 
pressure from borrowers throughout the country, the credit 
limits laid down by the state have been exceeded time and again. 
This has inevitably led to inflation. 
  [Gao] Loans are being made almost for free. This problem 
indeed exists to various degrees in our country, and it is a 
structural problem. That is to say, the inflation in our 
country is not only related to the current policies; instead, it 
is the result of the operation of the current structure. 
Therefore, the fundamental way to curb inflation is to reform 
the current structure. 
  [Zhong] In restraining inflation, the key lies in the 
establishment of a mechanism in the monetary structure which 
will prevent loan seekers from contracting endless amounts of 
loans and which will prompt them to be more conservative in 
taking out loans. Only when they are sure that the expected 
profits from the investment or the business project will be 
higher than the interest rate of the loan do they dare take the 
loan; otherwise, they will refuse to accept the loan even if the 
loan is offered to them. The mechanism should also discourage 
loan-extenders from offering loans recklessly; only when they 
are sure that the debtors can repay the principal with interest 
will they offer a loan. Under such a mechanism, there will 
appear a new situation in which hundreds of thousands of people 
are jointly exercising self-control over the size of loans. 
  [Gao] The character of the funds is determined by the 
characteristics of the financial institutions that provide such 
funds. If the financial institutions are not enterprises that 
have to bear sole responsibility for their own business profits 
and losses but are just government fund suppliers, then the 
funds they offer will have the same character as "rice from the 
big pot" [da guo fan 1129 6938 7391]. If the financial 
institutions are enterprises which operate on their own and bear 
sole responsibility for their business profits and losses, then 
they will treat the funds as a commodity. 
  [Zhong] In order to establish a mechanism which makes both 
loan-makers and money-borrowers jointly exercise self-control 
over the size of credit, it is necessary to make the commercial 
banks (including the current specialized banks) operate on their 
own and bear responsibility for their own business profits and 
losses. This is a necessary precondition. If the commercial 
banks really bear responsibility for their own profits and 
losses, then they will link the issuance of loans with their own 
interests and will make careful assessments and prudently handle 
the issuance and recovery of the loans. Before they make loans, 
they will carefully evaluate and scientifically analyze the 
liquidity of the debtor enterprises and the economic feasibility 
of the relevant projects and will not recklessly make credit 
arrangements; after the loans are made, they will try by every 
possible means to retrieve loans that are due for repayment. 
Thus, both loan-makers and loan-users will be facing great 
pressure, and they will behave more prudently and rationally 
when issuing and accepting loans. 
  [Gao] The rising demand for loans is also related to their 
comparatively low interest rate. Without changing this 
situation, even if there are tough terms for repayment, people 
may continue to seek more loans. 
  [Zhong] Reforming the interest rate mechanism is indeed a 
major measure for curbing inflation. In our country, the 
interest rate is sometimes lower than the inflation rate. The 
negative interest rate in reality is not conducive to 
restraining the demand for loans; nor is it conducive to 
increasing the supply of deposits. To solve this problem, we 
may appropriately raise the interest rate, but, in the long run, 
we must still take action in the structural aspect. That is, we 
should establish a structure in which the interest rates are 
formed and adjusted by market forces. With such a structure, 
when the demand for loans becomes too great, the interest rate 
will automatically rise, and the cost of funds will increase; 
thus, enterprises with poor business results will automatically 
shrink their scale of production and operation, and investment 
projects that do not yield good returns will automatically scale 
down. Furthermore, when the interest rate is increasing, 
deposits will become more attractive, and some residents will 
reduce consumption and add to their savings. The two 
developments are both conducive to reducing the currency in 
circulation and lowering commodity prices. 
  [Gao] In our country, inflation has close relations with the 
swelling of investment. Whenever the size of investment 
expands, currency inflation certainly takes place and commodity 
prices go up; whenever the size of investment is brought under 
control, prices go down. 
  [Zhong] At present, the funds for launching new projects 
primarily come from bank loans. If the funds for new projects 
come from the surplus money of residents or the accumulated 
funds of enterprises, then expansion in investment will be based 
primarily on the reduction in the enterprise bonuses and welfare 
funds and in the immediate consumption of the residents. This 
will only change the structure of demand in society and will not 
increase the overall quantity of demand. If the size of 
investment is expanded in this manner, it will accelerate 
economic growth and will not lead to inflation. Moreover, with 
such an investment structure plus reform of the banking system, 
there will be an effective mechanism for controlling the credit 
fund. Even if people are encouraged to launch new investment 
projects, they will not do so recklessly. Thus, inflation can be 
effectively curbed. In the long run, we cannot merely rely on 
administrative means to control the size of investment; instead, 
we should set up a self-control mechanism for investors by 
reforming the investment and monetary structures. 
  [Gao] There are also certain relations between enterprises' 
economic efficiency and the inflation situation. Do you think 
that it will be conducive to curbing inflation if more 
enterprises can register fewer business losses? 
  [Zhong] The enterprises which are running in the red 
constitute a cause of inflation in our country. The normal 
relationship between the enterprises and the market is as 
follows: The former puts currency (including savings) into the 
market and takes raw materials and consumer goods for its 
workers away from the market. Through one cycle of production, 
it puts products back into the market and retrieves the money it 
contributed in the past. This will not cause inflation. If 
products do not sell, and the enterprise incurs losses and 
cannot find a way out, then the enterprise will have to go 
bankrupt, and the money will be retrieved by auctioning off its 
assets. If the enterprise cannot use its products or assets to 
retrieve the money, then the money will remain in the market for 
a long time and will affect prices, thus causing inflation. 
  [Gao] When governments use bank overdrafts to cover 
financial 
deficits, this also causes inflation. One of the reasons behind 
the financial deficits is the failure to cut down on 
administrative expenses. What do you think we should do to 
solve this problem? 
  [Zhong] Advancing structural reform in government 
institutions is a good way to cut down on administrative 
expenses and is also an important element of curbing inflation. 
In our country, a major cause of inflation is the excessive 
size of government institutions, whose gigantic administrative 
expenses lead to financial deficits. When bank overdrafts are 
used to cover up these deficits, this directly leads to 
inflation. If the deficits are covered up by issuing public 
debt, the possibility of inflation still cannot be ruled out. 
Therefore, the efforts to curb inflation should also be linked 
with steps to streamline government institutions and reduce 
administrative expenses. 
  [Gao] Will the enterprises and local governments' method of 
raising funds by issuing bonds and stock also cause inflation? 
  [Zhong] The enterprises' issuance of bonds and stocks and 
the 
local governments' fund-raising activities play the same 
function as the banks' issuance of loans in increasing the 
quantity of currency in circulation. However, we cannot put a 
halt to necessary financial activities. In our country, means 
of direct fund-raising such as stocks and bonds, as compared 
with the means of indirect fund-raising with the banks playing 
an intermediate role, are not only representative of the changes 
in financial forms but are also representative of the changes in 
the monetary system and the character of the funds. The "gift" 
funds are thus changed into a type of commodity, and such a 
change is conducive to curbing inflation. Of course, in order 
to prevent the excessive size of direct fund-raising, which may 
lead to the swelling of credit, we should properly handle things 
in two aspects: First, there should be a limit for the gross 
size of direct fund-raising. Second, when the size of direct 
fund-raising is expanding, indirect fund-raising among the banks 
should be scaled down accordingly.

<F P=106> [RENMIN RIBAO 23 June editorial: "Earnestly Implementing </F>
State Industrial Policy"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 22 Jun (XINHUA) -- The "Outline of State 
Industrial Policy in the Nineties" recently promulgated by the 
State Council is carried in today's edition of this newspaper. 
The "Outline" is an important document guiding our country's 
work in making industrial policy, as well as a major policy 
basis for readjusting and optimizing the industrial structure at 
present and for some time to come. Earnestly fulfilling the 
demands outlined in the document will play a very important role 
in promoting sustained, rapid, and healthy national development. 
  Industrial policy is an important means by which the state 
tightens and improves macroeconomic regulation and control, 
readjusts and optimizes the industrial structure, brings about 
qualitative improvements in industry, and rationally distributes 
resources over the long term. The State Council promulgated the 
"Decision of the State Council on the Gist of Current Industrial 
Policy" in March of 1989. The "Decision" played a positive role 
in controlling inflation, in establishing a normal industrial 
development order, and in increasing the supply of essential 
goods. Our country's reform, opening up, and modernization have 
entered a new stage of vigorous development since the beginning 
of the nineties, especially since Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
delivered his important talks in early 1992 and the 14th CPC 
National Congress. Our national economy has grown rapidly, and 
both the pattern of domestic demand and the international 
economic environment have undergone significant changes. To 
meet the requirements of economic development in the new 
situation, the State Council formulated the "Outline of State 
Industrial Policy in the Nineties," in which it clearly 
specified the major principles for readjusting and optimizing 
the industrial structure, priorities in industrial development, 
and the safeguard policies to be implemented in coordination, 
with a view to effectively steering our national economy toward 
realizing the second-step strategic objective of national 
economic and social development. 
  Our country is currently in a crucial period of accelerating 
the establishment of a socialist market economic structure. 
During the process of establishing a new structure, the market 
should be allowed to play a fundamental role in distributing 
resources while the state should tighten macroeconomic 
regulation and control and provide guidance for the rational 
distribution of resources over the long term. Industrial policy 
is at the core of long-term development policy. The tangible 
achievements scored by the economically developed countries in 
the world, especially by a great many Asian countries and 
regions, have corroborated the important role played by 
industrial policy. Our country is establishing a socialist 
market economic structure as its industrial structure is 
undergoing significant changes. This requires the government to 
formulate rational and farsighted structural policy and to guide 
economic development on its own initiative so as to avert 
haphazard production and investment activities and improve 
macroeconomic returns and economic performance. 
  Based on an in-depth analysis of the trends of change in our 
country's industrial structure, in accordance with the objective 
laws governing the process of industrialization and 
modernization, the "Outline" clearly specifies the main 
direction and aspects of our country's industrial restructuring 
during the nineties; that is, continuously strengthening the 
status of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, 
developing the rural economy in an all-around way, vigorously 
beefing up basic industries, striving to relieve the strain 
posed by the slow development of basic industries and 
infrastructure, accelerating the development of mainstay 
industries to promote overall national economic development, 
rationally restructuring foreign trade, sharpening the 
competitive edge of our industries in the international market, 
quickening the pace of developing industries using new and high 
technology, supporting the development of new industries and 
products, and continuing to develop tertiary industry 
energetically. Moreover, efforts should be made to optimize the 
industrial organizational structure and to improve industrial 
technological levels so as to render the industrial pattern more 
rational. All in all, the "Outline" fully outlines the general 
trend and pattern of our country's industrial development and 
clearly sets forth the major principles and policies for 
readjusting and optimizing the industrial structure. 
  The "Outline," a document providing guidance on industrial 
policy work, sets forth general requirements which must be 
fulfilled one by one through specific policies. So far, the 
State Council has promulgated the "Industrial Policy for the Car 
Industry," which specifically sets the goal of developing this 
key industry and explains its industrial organization, 
technology, distribution, and foreign investment and trade 
policies. This specific industrial policy has begun to be 
implemented. The State Council has also promulgated criteria of 
economic scale for investment and construction on a number of 
important products to achieve economies of scale in these 
industries and increase their competitiveness. Pursuant to the 
requirements of the "Outline," the State Council will formulate 
one by one additional specific industrial policies on transport, 
telecommunications, construction, electronics, machine-building, 
petrochemical, foreign investment, trade, technology, and 
industrial reorganization to fulfill what is required in the 
"Outline." 
  The "Outline" also specifies procedures for formulating 
industrial policy and the method of implementing it. This 
provides an important guarantee ensuring that industrial policy 
is scientific, authoritative, and effective in implementation 
and helps move the work of formulating industrial policy closer 
to standardization and establishing it on an institutional and 
legal basis. The "Outline" specifically calls for the 
establishment of systems of decisionmaking, work procedures, 
examination and approval, logistic support, supervision and 
inspection, and evaluation of the state's industrial policy. 
These systems, which will be established in line with the usual 
practice of a market economy, with due attention to bringing 
into play the initiatives of all quarters, will greatly raise 
the government's work efficiency in formulating and implementing 
industrial policy. 
  Once state industrial policy is formulated, the important 
thing is implementation. From our countries' experience in 
formulating industrial policy, and in light of the fairly 
successful foreign practice in implementing industrial policy, 
it is crucial that the following four links be grasped well for 
the implementation of the "Outline": First, all departments and 
localities must organize a drive to earnestly study and 
publicize the "Outline" so that state industrial policy is 
extensively understood and recognized. It is necessary to study 
and understand what the "Outline" requires and enhance our 
consciousness in implementing it from the perspective of quickly 
and successfully pushing forward the development of the entire 
economy and establishing a socialist market economic structure. 
Second, it is necessary to stress coordination and consistency 
between state industrial policies and other economic policies. 
Effective implementation of industrial policies requires 
effective coordination of other economic policies, particularly 
on financial, banking, taxation, price, foreign trade, and 
foreign investment. Departments of planning, finance, banking, 
taxation, customs, stock supervision, administration for 
industry and commerce, and state-owned property management, as 
well as relevant specialized departments and local governments 
should appropriately adjust their policy measures within their 
jurisdiction and implement effective logistic support systems in 
accordance with the general requirements of the "Outline" to 
ensure their coordinated functioning in line with the state's 
general industrial policy. Third, it is necessary to handle well 
the relationship between implementing state industrial policy 
and bringing into play the market mechanism. In implementing 
industrial policy, it is necessary to pay attention to bringing 
into play the role of market mechanism and, under the state's 
macroeconomic regulation and control, bring into full play the 
basic role of the market in the allocation of resources to 
ensure the realization of the goal of structural adjustment. It 
is necessary to use economic means and legal measures to provide 
guidance and carry out coordination. Fourth, it is necessary to 
handle well the relationship between partial and overall 
interests. The "Outline" requires that local governments at the 
provincial level specifically study the formulation of 
implementing measures in light of local realities. In enacting 
implementation measures, provinces, autonomous regions, and 
municipalities should stress bringing into play their relative 
strong points while taking into consideration the state's 
overall interests and avoid the tendency to consider partial 
interests alone to the neglect of overall interests. In 
developing local economies, governments at all levels should 
earnestly and consciously implement state industrial policy. In 
the case of industries supported by state industrial policy, 
they can develop them in light of local realities and in line 
with national distribution arrangements. In the case of 
industries incompatible with state industrial policies, they 
should consciously follow state industrial policy and refrain 
from violating them; otherwise, they will affect national 
economic development and at the same time cause economic losses 
to the localities. Only by so doing can we promote sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development of the economy which, in the 
final analysis, will help bring about effective growth of the 
local economy.

<F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Lu Mu (7627 3668) from "Views on </F>
Economic Life" column: "How To View the General Situation of 
State Enterprises?"] 
  [Text] Properly improving state enterprises is the focus of 
our economic work. How to view the general situation of state 
enterprises has become a universal concern of the people. 
<H5>  Powerful Strength of State Enterprises Remains </H5>
  Our country's state enterprises have developed steadily 
since 
reform and opening up began. The 1985 general survey on 
industry throughout the country showed that the total number of 
large and medium industrial enterprises was 8,285. In 1990, 
that is, five years later, the number had increased to 13,469. 
In 1992, the number again rose to 13,719. 
  State enterprises, in particular large and medium-sized 
ones, 
are the mainstay of socialist modernization and the main source 
of state financial revenue. In the first year of the 1990's, 
the number of large and medium-sized enterprises accounted for 
only 3.2 percent of the total number of industrial enterprises 
which kept separate accounts, but the original value of their 
fixed assets accounted for 67.6 percent of the total; their net 
output value, 58.4 percent of the total; their income from 
product sales, 56.4 percent of the total; and their volume of 
taxes and profits, 68.2 percent of the total. 
  By 1992, among industrial enterprises at and above the 
township level, the output value of state enterprises accounted 
for 59 percent of the total; their profits and taxes obtained, 
69.43 percent of the total; and their taxes and profits handed 
over to the state, 76.8 percent of the total. According to 
statistics from the departments concerned, since 1978, China's 
gross domestic output value has grown at an average annual rate 
of 9 percent, while the average annual growth rate of state 
enterprises was 8 percent. This shows that the powerful 
strength of state enterprises continues. 
<H5>  Difficulties in the Course of Advance </H5>
  There is no denying the fact that in the early stage of the 
transition from a highly concentrated unitary planned economic 
structure to a socialist market economy, some trades and 
enterprises of our country's state industry of our country have 
actually encountered various kinds of difficulties in their 
production and operation. For example, the situation of the 
entire coal industry's long-standing losses has not 
fundamentally changed, and the textile industry also suffered 
losses as a whole last year. In 1993, 31.8 percent of state 
industrial enterprises included in the state budget suffered 
losses. Also, the burden on state enterprises is excessive and 
they lack the strength for further development. In 1992, 
profits and taxes handed over to the state by state enterprises 
accounted for 88 percent of those obtained, which was 20 
percentage points over those provided by collective enterprises 
and about 100 percent over those from enterprises in other 
economic sectors. They depend on bank loans for a large amount 
of their working funds and this again increases their burdens 
because of interest payments. Moreover, the internal management 
of some state enterprises has tended to become poorer, causing a 
decline in economic results. 
  However, all these problems are mainly caused by the 
irrational structure of industries, products, and enterprise 
organizations; slow technological progress; problems with 
prices, which are not yet completely solved; and, in particular, 
the operational structure, which is not yet really changed. 
They are problems in the course of the advance and can 
certainly be solved through deepening reform. The problem of the 
excessive burden of state enterprises, for example, has been or 
is being solved following the coordinated reforms carried out in 
finance, banking, and so on. The Baoshan Iron and Steel 
Company, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, the Yangzi Ethylene 
Plant, and a large number of other large and medium-sized 
enterprises have adopted the method of separating the "main body 
from the supplementary bodies" and of "setting separate 
accounts" to gradually relieve themselves of the heavy burden of 
"enterprises running society" on their shoulders. 
  Poor management in production and operations, low economic 
results, and other problems not only exist in state enterprises, 
but also exist in township and town enterprises, Sino-foreign 
joint ventures, and enterprises owned by individuals. These 
problems have accumulated over a long period of time and cannot 
be solved at one go. To solve these problems, we must make 
concerted efforts, energetically carry out exploration, and 
persist in deepening the reform of the economic structure and 
the enterprise system. 
<H5>  The Road of Enterprise Reform Becomes Broader and Broader </H5>
  Authoritative personalities in economic circles were correct 
when they said the socialist market economy structure was a new 
type of economic structure which integrates with the basic 
socialist system. The position and role of the state economy 
cannot be replaced by other economic sectors. In carrying out 
reform of the economic structure in our country, we should 
always regard public ownership as the main body and promote the 
common development of various economic sectors. We should never 
take the road of privatization in reforming state enterprises 
today or in the future. 
  Some old leaders and old specialists who have been engaged 
in 
industrial economic work for a long time, universally hold that 
since the 1980's, the whole country has all along been making 
efforts to improve state enterprises and the road of enterprise 
reform has become broader and broader. Although the road taken 
has been rough and bumpy, we have achieved fruitful results, 
such as the promulgation and implementation of the "Enterprise 
Law," the relevant "regulations," and so on. This is clear to 
all. Enterprise reform in our country started with the 
delegation of greater power to enterprises and was followed by 
changing the operational mechanism of enterprises. The Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, in 
particular, made clear the goal and means of establishing a 
modern enterprise system. We have finally found, through 
explorations, a broad road for state enterprises to move toward 
the market and to become prosperous and flourishing. 
  Our country's state enterprises were brilliant in the past, 
remain brilliant today, and will certainly be even more 
brilliant in the future.

  [Text] Beijing, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Officials and scholars 
from several government departments last have held a forum on 
the white paper on intellectual property rights protection in 
China, which was released by the Information Office of the State 
Council on the 16th of this month. [sentence as published] 
  Jia Mingru of the State Council's Bureau of Legislative 
Affairs said at the forum that the white paper has for the first 
time systematically expounded China's stand on and attitude 
toward intellectual property rights in the form of an official 
publication. 
  He said that China will draw up border measures later this 
year for the benefit of intellectual property rights protection 
as well as promulgate laws and regulations to bolster the 
protection of integrated circuits and flora species. 
  Dong Baolin, a senior economist from the Trademark Office of 
the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, said that 
the implementation of the country's trademark law since 1983 has 
been followed by a rise in the number of both domestic and 
foreign trademarks registered in China. 
  By the end of 1993, China had approved over 410,000 
trademarks, including some 60,000 items from 67 countries and 
regions worldwide, the economist said. 
  He added that the application volume in the first five 
months 
of this year has outstripped that of the corresponding period of 
last year. 
  "This has demonstrated China's sincerity and resolution in 
protecting trademarks," Dong stressed. "It also shows an 
attractive Chinese market and a sound investment environment in 
China." 
  Duan Ruichun, an official from the State Science and 
Technology Commission, said that the white paper will help 
eliminate misunderstandings about China's intellectual property 
rights protection situation and promote bilateral and 
multi-lateral cooperation between China and the rest of the 
world. 
  Wen Xikai of the State Patent Office said that the state 
patent law, in effect since 1985, has spurred domestic 
inventions and foreign patent applications and resulted in a 24 
percent annual increase in the overall number of patent 
applications. 
  By the end of last year, the bureau had received 360,000 
patent applications, 13.6 percent of which were from outside the 
country. 
  "Any fair-minded person should no longer harbor any doubt 
about China's sincerity and ability in protecting intellectual 
property rights," she noted. 
  Wang Huapeng, an official from the State Copyright Bureau, 
said that though the country's copyright law is only three years 
old, China is one of the few countries in the world to have put 
computer software under protection. 
  Zhang Yuqing, a senior scholar at the Ministry of Foreign 
Trade and Economic Cooperation, said that international trade 
would be virtually impossible today if there were no 
intellectual property rights protection. 
  He said that pirated compact and laser discs are still seen 
in some parts of China. 
  "This has harmed the development of the national music 
industry," he said. He hoped to see further measures 
implemented to deal with the problem. 
  Vice-Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission 
Hui Yongzheng said that China's expected economic development 
will be accompanied by the arduous task of protecting 
intellectual property rights. 
  "China is always ready to cooperate with other countries on 
the basis of equality and mutual benefit," he said. "However, 
China resolutely opposes any act of interference in its internal 
affairs under the pretext of intellectual property rights 
protection."

<F P=106> [Article by Li Wenzhang, an official with the State </F>
Administration for Industry and Commerce: "Trademarks Ease 
Shift to Socialist Market Economy"] 
  [Text] The transition from central planning to the market 
economy can pick up pace if the special role of trademarks is 
better implemented. 
  The importance of trademarks in opening up markets and 
building economic strength requires greater attention from 
Chinese enterprises. 
  A good trademark can bring huge economic benefits and a 
bright future for an enterprise. But many firms, especially 
those large- and medium-sized ones, have not fully realized the 
importance of registering trademarks as an intellectual property 
right. Consequently, their sense of protecting their own 
trademarks is rather weak and some have suffered grave economic 
losses due to infringement cases. 
  Since the Trademark Law was issued in 1983, China has set up 
a registration and administration system as a legal guarantee 
for developing the market economy. 
  Such a legal system is important because, first of all, it 
directly regulates the performance of market competitors--both 
manufacturers and sellers. The trade mark system is a basic 
legal set-up for China's socialist market economy. 
  And as a very important part of the legal system protecting 
intellectual rights, trademarks cover registrations application, 
administration, and the protection of property rights. 
  Secondly, it is a necessary guarantee of fair competition 
for 
enterprises. Being independent economic bodies and facing an 
open market, enterprises must seek as much profit as possible to 
maintain their own interests and win market competition. 
  Big profits can only be achieved with quality goods and 
services. Thus enterprises need to improve the quality of their 
products and develop their own markets with credible trademarks. 
  For instance, if an enterprise develops a new product, gives 
it a trademark, and has it registered it will then have made the 
necessary preparations for the product to enter the market. 
  Its property rights will then be protected by law in case 
the 
trademark is infringed upon by others, whether the violation was 
intentional or accidental. 
  China is using both administrative and legal functions to 
maintain fair economic order and encourage product improvements. 
  Thirdly, trademarks are the basis for conducting 
international economic cooperation and exchanges. 
  The material resources and technologies of a country are 
limited. A nation can only develop more quickly and meet 
domestic material demand with aid from international businesses. 
  In today's world economy, intellectual property is rapidly 
increasing as property rights are becoming critical factors in 
economic cooperation. Thus, setting up a law for intellectual 
property rights, like the Trademark Law, has become 
indispensable. 
  Such a law conforms to the interests of developed and 
developing nations. This is because, without a law protecting 
trademark holders, international sales of high-quality products 
becomes impossible. 
  It is quite clear that no one wants to invest and sell goods 
in a country which does not protect intellectual rights and 
leaves loopholes for counterfeits of advanced foreign products. 
  As for domestic enterprises, their initiative for improving 
product quality will be hurt if their special right for 
registered trademarks is not well protected by the government 
and fair competition will not be well established. 
  The Chinese law has promoted the rapid development of its 
economy and also provided a legal basis for this rapid 
development. 
  Trademarks, in addition, are a part of the commercial 
culture. Apart from meeting the legal requirements, a producer 
has to carefully study whether its trade mark will be accepted 
by the public. 
  Popular foreign trademarks, such as Coca-Cola, Kodak, and 
Mercedes Benz symbolize the economy, culture, and political and 
national spirit of a country. While indicating their countries' 
economic strength, they also reflect the nation's spiritual 
pursuit for superb quality and perfection. 
  China's trademark system has basically met the needs of the 
country's market economic system. However, problems still exist. 
  One is that public awareness about the law is generally low 
and the quality of administrative workers needs to be upgraded; 
more efforts are needed to protect the special rights of 
trademark holders and more importance should be attached to 
trademark administration in China.

<F P=106> [Article by Li Wen: "Trade Promotion Body Set Up"] </F>
  [Text] A nongovernment organization aiming to promote 
economic cooperation between China and other Northeast Asian 
countries was founded in Beijing yesterday. The Chinese 
Association for the Promotion of International Technological and 
Economic Cooperation in Northeast Asia is the first of its kind. 
  "The focus of the world economy is moving from the West to 
the Asia-Pacific region, in which Northeast Asia boasts great 
potential for development," said Yang Shouzheng, president of 
the association. 
  The detente after 40 years of "Cold War" provides the region 
with a stable climate for technological and economic 
cooperation. With their rich resources and a huge market, 
Northeast Asian countries have placed market economy as the 
priority in their economic development. 
  The founding of the association is to meet the needs of the 
region by providing consultancy services and promoting exchange 
and co-operation. "Trade between China and Northeast Asia has 
been growing steadily over the past few years," said Pi 
Shenghao, deputy director with China International Trust and 
Investment Corporation Research International. 
  Bilateral trade has been active. 
  Trade between China and the Republic of Korea (ROK) reached 
$8.9 billion last year and that with Russia amounted to $7.2 
billion, a 24 percent increase over the previous year. 
  Trade with Japan, China's biggest trade partner after Hong 
Kong, reached $39 billion last year, a 30 percent increase over 
1992. 
  Meanwhile, economic co-operation between Japan and Russia, 
and between ROK and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, 
has also seen steady growth. Besides trade links, Pi said, the 
neighbouring countries are working together under a United 
Nations programme to develop the Tumen River Development Zone, 
which borders China, Russia, and the DPRK. 
  The United Nations Development Programme will invest $30 
billion in the massive project over the next 20 years. "The 
project will boost relations among Northeast Asian countries," 
said Pi. 
  In the three northeastern provinces in China, Harbin has 
established itself as the conduit for commerce with Russia. 
Since 1990, an annual border trade fair has been organized in 
Harbin, attracting businessmen from nearby regions and other 
parts of the world. 
  Tianjin and Dalian have also held such fairs. 
  To expand international cooperation and investment, the new 
association will hold an international academic symposium and a 
trade fair with the theme, "Northeast Asia looking to the 21st 
Century," in April next year.

<F P=106> [CHINA DAILY Commentary: "Racing to the Future"] </F>
  [Text] The State Council has just issued strict measures to 
curb the rampant expansion of the futures market and urged 
strict enforcement in exchanges and brokerage firms. 
  Earlier, the central government called a temporary halt to 
the operation of property rights exchanges for rectification. 
  Meanwhile, fact-finding groups were sent by the state to 
local futures and property rights exchanges to collect 
information for making further decisions. 
  Obviously, such measures are not intended to stifle the 
futures market or the trade in State enterprises' property. 
  As a matter of fact, it is aimed at standardizing the 
operation of those exchanges and leading them to a healthy track. 
  In the long run, the central government is encouraging 
futures development and trade in property rights. 
  To open futures markets and property rights exchanges is a 
big step toward establishing a framework of the socialist market 
economy. It also shows China's determination to embrace a 
market economy. 
  However, their development has been too hasty for the 
reforms. Local governments have been rushing headlong to set up 
exchanges. As a result, their operation very often fails to meet 
standard requirements. 
  Nationally, there are more than 40 registered futures 
exchanges, over 500 brokerage firms, and 174 property rights 
exchanges. 
  The central authorities have reaffirmed that the futures 
market and the trade of property rights are still in an 
experimental stage. It is necessary to mention that prudence is 
the key to their pace of development. 
  Some local authorities are taking the wrong approach to 
futures and property rights exchanges. 
  Some assume opening futures exchanges will boost their local 
coffers. Some tried to get rid of some money-losing state 
enterprises instead of trying to improve their management. 
  Their view has fueled the overheated development of those 
exchanges. 
  In addition, due to lack of relevant laws and regulations, 
profiteers take advantage of the loopholes to pocket illicit 
earnings in the fledgling markets. 
  Some futures firms make money simply by swindling their 
customers. And some profiteers try to manipulate the selling 
price of state enterprises. 
  Thus, profiteers are often the only beneficiaries while 
customers and the state lose out. 
  As a Chinese saying goes, you cannot draw a circle and a 
square unless you have a compass and a ruler. The development 
of futures and trade of property rights will suffer setbacks 
unless they are placed under proper guidance. 
  Relevant government departments are drafting regulations on 
the management of those exchanges. It is necessary and timely 
to lead these exchanges to a path of healthy growth.

<F P=106> [Article by staff reporters Li Miaoying (2621 5379 5391) and </F>
Zhang Chuanxi (1728 0278 3556): "Foreign-Funded Enterprises in 
Guangdong Play All Kinds of Tricks To Evade Taxes"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 12 Jun (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- A 
relevant official from the Guangdong Provincial Taxation Bureau 
has revealed that investigation results have shown that 
approximately half of the foreign-funded enterprises in 
Guangdong have evaded taxes in one way or another. The problem 
is becoming increasingly serious and has had an impact on 
Guangdong's financial revenue. 
  The official said that the phenomena of tax evasion -- such 
as the non-synchronous growth of the industrial output value and 
the amount of tax receipts -- are quite conspicuous in many 
localities in Guangdong. The gross output value of the 
foreign-funded enterprises in a certain city in Guangdong 
accounted for 60 percent of the industrial output value of that 
city, but the taxes paid by these enterprises accounted for only 
15 percent of the total. 
  The Taxation Bureau official said that, in one or two 
cities, 
60 percent of the foreign-funded enterprises had evaded taxes. 
  Foreign-funded enterprises play all kinds of tricks to evade 
taxes. The major ones are as follows: 
  1. Prices for imported goods are overstated and prices for 
exported products are understated, resulting in losses or low 
profits as recorded in the accounts. Foreign-funded enterprises 
which import materials and export finished products evade taxes 
by exercising control over the rights of purchase and sales 
abroad and by overstating the prices for imported goods and 
understating the prices of exported products, and the accounts 
show low profits or losses. A foreign-funded toy plant in 
Foshan City, in which over $4 million was invested, announced 
accumulated losses of $1.8 million after operating for less than 
one year. An investigation by the taxation departments showed 
that the plant had tried to evade taxes by reporting losses. 
Although the plant claimed to have suffered heavy losses, it 
continued to inject enormous amounts of money to expand the 
scale of production. 
  2. "Surrogate pregnancy" is used to avoid attention. The 
products of a foreign-funded cosmetics plant in a certain city 
are in great demand both at home and abroad, but the plant 
announces heavy losses after operating for two years. At the 
same time, another cosmetic company which produces the same type 
of products is set up in the same city. Although its scale of 
production is relatively small, it posts record sales of over 
6,000 cases of cosmetics in a six-month period. Investigation 
has shown that the products manufactured and sold by the company 
were in fact "borrowed" from the plant. The taxation department 
demanded that the plant pay 6 million yuan in back taxes. 
  3. Depreciation is overstated to increase the production 
costs. 
  The taxation department official said that he believes many 
foreign-funded enterprises have suddenly become rich through 
evading taxes. 
  The issue of foreign-funded enterprises evading taxes in 
Guangdong has attracted the close attention of the relevant 
government departments. The State General Administration of 
Taxation set up an anti-tax evasion group not long ago in 
Shenzhen City, where many foreign-funded enterprises are 
concentrated. The group will monitor and control foreign-funded 
enterprises' tax payment on the basis of extensively collecting 
various kinds of data. The Guangdong Provincial Taxation Bureau 
is also working out effective measures to deal with the problem. 
An official concerned said that the new tax system implemented 
this year would be conducive to effectively carrying out 
anti-tax evasion work. The use of unified value-added invoices 
beginning from 1 July, for example, would be helpful to solving 
the problem of tax evasion.

  [Text] Shenyang, June 23 (XINHUA) -- China has set up over 
400 firms involved in overseas labor services, and they are 
undertaking contracted projects in more than 170 countries and 
regions throughout the world. 
  The latest report from the relevant government department 
shows that a total of more than 48,000 overseas labor service 
projects have been signed since 1979 by various types of Chinese 
service companies, involving 34.16 billion U.S. dollars, with an 
accumulated turnover of 20.74 billion U.S. dollars. 
  The report also indicates that in the first four months of 
this year the overseas labor service contracts signed reached 
2.05 billion U.S. dollars with a turnover of 1.44 billion U.S. 
dollars, a hefty rise from the same period of last year. 
  In 1993 China signed over 11,600 such contracts worth 6.8 
billion U.S. dollars, with an overall turnover of 4.538 billion 
U.S. dollars, and about 174,000 experts and skilled workers were 
sent abroad. 
  Over the past few years China has contracted various 
projects 
in industry, agriculture and the service industries, including 
oil refineries and textile factories. 
  China's overseas services industry began almost at the same 
time as the reform and open policies were initiated in the late 
1970s and early 1980s. Before this, China used to render free 
labor services abroad, the official said.

  [Text] Beijing, June 23 (XINHUA) -- China is happy to see 
the positive developments on the Korean nuclear issue and 
appreciates the wise attitude adopted by the parties concerned 
for a peaceful settlement of the issue, Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman Wu Jianmin said here today. 
  U.S. President Clinton announced today that the U.S. would 
hold the third round of talks with DPRK in Geneva in early July 
to seek an overall improvement of relations between the two 
countries, Wu noted at a press conference here this afternoon. 
  He continued that according to Clinton, the U.S. would also 
stop pushing for sanctions against DPRK in the UN Security 
Council. Meanwhile, DPRK and ROK have reached an agreement on 
holding preliminary talks for a summit meeting between them. 
  Wu said, China is happy to see these positive developments 
on 
the Korean nuclear issue and appreciates the wise attitude 
adopted and positive efforts made by the parties concerned for a 
peaceful settlement of this issue. 
  The spokesman stressed that dialogue, instead of exerting 
pressure, is the basic way for a peaceful and proper settlement 
of the Korean nuclear issue. "This conforms to the interests of 
all parties and serves peace and stability on the peninsula." 
  China sincerely hopes that all parties concerned will 
treasure and seize upon this important turning point, persist in 
consultation and dialogue with an equal, pragmatic and sincere 
approach and make constructive efforts to bring about a 
denuclearized, peaceful and stable Korean peninsula, he said.

<F P=106> ["Political talk" column by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 3768): </F>
"Carter's Success, the White House's Incompetence"] 
  [Text] The tense situation on the Korean peninsula has 
eased following former U.S. President Carter's mediation in 
Pyongyang, and U.S. President Clinton has also changed his tone. 
Contrary to Carter's assertion, it is hard to say whether the 
crisis is over. There may yet be a relapse. As a matter of 
fact, however, this once again reveals the weakness of the U.S. 
Government's diplomacy. 
<H5>  Washington Is Neither Cold Nor Hot </H5>
  Carter was the U.S. President for only four years. He 
entered the White House bemoaning the state of the universe and 
pitying the fate of mankind like a preacher. He did not achieve 
very much despite arduous efforts in administration, so he was 
not reelected president. After he withdrew from office, he ran 
a peanut farm while silently devoting his efforts to peace. 
Unlike other retired U.S. presidents, he has frequently been 
involved in seemingly ordinary activities which were actually 
quite meaningful. This frequently earned him praise. 
  His shuttle mediation between Seoul, Pyongyang, and 
Washington was a rare activity which showed a magnanimous 
attitude. He obtained a positive response from Pyongyang, and 
preparations are being made for a historic summit meeting 
between the two Kims. Washington was suspicious in the 
beginning, but later admitted that "there are indications of 
hope," thus softening its stance. 
  Viewing the responses of White House officials and Clinton, 
there is still a gap between the U.S. Government, Carter, and 
Seoul in their assessment of the situation. Carter said that 
"complete agreement" had been reached with Pyongyang on major 
issues, whereas Seoul nimbly responded to Kim Il-song's proposal 
for a summit meeting, immediately agreeing and actively making 
preparations. Comparatively speaking, Washington is neither cold 
nor hot. 
<H5>  Washington Does Not Intend To Have a Dialogue </H5>
  On one hand, Washington warmly welcomed some of Pyongyang's 
positive actions, such as not expelling the two International 
Atomic Energy Agency inspection personnel. On the other, it 
coldly responded to Pyongyang's proposal to freeze its nuclear 
program, asking Pyongyang to make a written guarantee apart from 
allowing nuclear inspections. Washington neither objected to 
nor supported the proposal for a summit, indicating its 
unwillingness to participate in a dialogue. 
  Washington and Pyongyang have conducted two rounds of formal 
talks. In Washington's mind, the talks are a method for putting 
pressure on Pyongyang, not improving understanding and reducing 
misunderstandings. Taking advantage of the DPRK's hope to 
rebuild its relations with the United States, it has set many 
preconditions for the talks and has "raised the prices." After 
Carter reported on the results of his Pyongyang tour, the United 
States revoked its demand that the DPRK explain its previous 
replacement of nuclear materials. This may be considered a kind 
of progress. 
  Carter's Pyongyang tour precisely suggests that dialogue is 
the most important element. Carter conducted his mediation 
effort as an "ordinary civilian." His success shows the White 
House's incompetence. 
<H5>  Rumors About Washington </H5>
  Washington's method of handling the crisis was clumsy. If 
Carter had not appeared on the scene and reversed the 
development trend, Clinton would have found himself in an even 
more awkward position. The U.S. threat of sanctions is baffling. 
The United States has no economic or military relations with 
the DPRK, and its sanctions must be enforced by a third party. 
Countries which can play a role in this respect are China, 
Japan, Russia, the ROK, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. The U.S. allies 
in Europe cannot help. China is opposed to sanctions; Japan and 
the ROK are hesitating; Iran, Iraq, and Syria will not take 
instructions from the United States; and the only one left is 
Russia. When working out a UN Security Council resolution, the 
United States did not consult Russia, which made it so angry 
that it was not willing to cooperate with the United States. As 
a result, their relations were tense for some time. When Carter 
said in Pyongyang that sanctions had been put aside, Washington 
immediately denied it. As a matter of fact, Carter had hit the 
mark quite by accident. 
  At a time when U.S. diplomacy is in a mess, rumors are 
spreading in Washington that the secretary of state will be 
replaced, and the candidate is said to be Secretary of Treasury 
Bentsen. These rumors have been spreading for months. Even if 
Clinton does not have this intention, it also suggests that 
people in and outside the government are dissatisfied with U.S. 
foreign policy.

"Deng Xiaoping Recently Visited Qingdao, Mentioned Three Major 
Problems in China's Development"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 22 Jun (WEN WEI PO) -- Authoritative 
persons here disclosed that not long ago, accompanied by Central 
Military Commission Vice Chairman Liu Huaqing, former CPC leader 
Deng Xiaoping toured Qingdao, Shandong. 
  Mentioning fundamental problems regarding the country's 
development, Deng Xiaoping said that it is necessary to pay 
attention to and stick to three points: First, except when an 
inevitable large-scale war breaks out, the principle of taking 
economic development as the center must absolutely never be 
changed, the policy of reform and opening up must absolutely 
never be changed, and the party's basic line must not be shaken 
for one hundred years to come. Second, it is necessary to sum 
up the lesson of the former Soviet Union, and it is necessary to 
properly handle the relationship between the center and 
localities. Third, it is necessary to stick to the CPC's 
leadership and the CPC's ruling status must never be shaken. 
China must not pursue a multiparty system. 
  It is learned that Deng Xiaoping's above views have already 
been relayed to central high-ranking personalities.

<F P=106> [By the editorial group for the "Military Writings of Mao </F>
Zedong": "Reveal Mao Zedong's Military Thinking in a Complete 
and Comprehensive Manner -- A Brief Introduction to the 
`Military Writings of Mao Zedong'"] 
  [Text] The newly published, six-volume Military 
Writings of Mao Zedong (henceforth shortened as 
Writings), totalling 2.67 million characters, 
consists of 1,612 military cables, commands, reports, letters, 
and theoretical works on military affairs written by Mao Zedong 
between August 1927 and December 1972, most of them never 
published before. The new publication is the most systematic 
and comprehensive military work to date by Mao Zedong. It 
documents in detail the founding of the Chinese People's 
Liberation Army [PLA] from next to nothing, its development from 
a small into a large army, and its outstanding war record; sheds 
light on the formation, maturation, and development of Mao 
Zedong's military thinking, vividly showing Mao Zedong's highly 
successful troop maneuvers and brilliant art of military 
command; and displays relatively comprehensively the theoretical 
structure of Mao Zedong's military thinking. The work is Mao 
Zedong's rich and valuable theoretical heritage for military 
theory and philosophical thinking. 
  The first volume of the Writings contains 
247 of Mao Zedong's military essays written during the Agrarian 
Revolutionary War which highlight Mao Zedong's painstaking 
exploration of a range of issues, such as carving out a path for 
the Chinese Revolution, establishing a new type of people's 
army, and people's war and its strategies and tactics. 
  After the fiasco of the 1927 Revolution, the CPC began to 
probe seriously for a path for the Chinese Revolution. In his 
"Speech at the Emergency Central Conference," "Outline of the 
Hunan Movement," and "Autumn Harvest Uprising in Hunan Requires 
Army Support," Mao Zedong puts forward explicitly the idea of 
seizing political power by force and by combining peasants' 
uprisings with military support. With the defeat of the Autumn 
Harvest Uprising, Mao Zedong boldly pulled his insurgent army 
back to rural areas, where the enemy's rule was weak, and 
established a revolutionary power base in Jinggangshan, where he 
built an "armed independent regime of workers and peasants." In 
the "Writings," letters and papers, such as the "Letter to the 
Central Committee Through the Good Offices of the Hunan and 
Jiangxi Party Committees" and the 20 March and 5 April 1929 
letters from the Red Fourth Army Front Committee to the Central 
Committee, concentrate on probing for a theory to account for 
"armed independent regimes of workers and peasants," and 
policies and strategies on the struggle against the enemy. 
The publication in early 1930 of A Single Spark Can 
Start a Prairie Fire marked the formation of Mao Zedong's 
basic theory on the path of the Chinese Revolution. 
  Mao Zedong made the most important theoretical and practical 
contributions to the process of founding a new type of 
proletarian revolutionary army. A range of key principles he 
advanced during this time -- such as affirming party leadership 
over the Army, the establishment of a democratic system within 
the Army, the pursuit of the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and 
Eight Points for Attention," the three assignments of combating, 
fund raising, and mass work for the Red Army, strengthening 
political education, and laying down correct military-political 
relationships -- drew a fundamental line between the Red Army 
and all the previous armies. Mao Zedong's "Letter to Lin Biao" 
on 14 June 1929 is an important piece of literature on the 
development of the People's Army, spelling out the basic 
principles for a new type of army and paving the way for the 
"Gutian Conference Resolutions." The Writings 
prints the full text of the "Resolutions at the Ninth Congress 
of the Fourth Army of the CPC Red Army" (that is "Gutian 
Conference Resolutions"), which systematically sums up the 
army-building experience since the founding of the Fourth Army 
of the Red Army, and is a programmatic paper for the development 
of the People's Army. 
  Exploring the warfare experience, which involved great 
hardship, Mao Zedong came up with a whole set of strategies and 
tactics tailored to the characteristics of China's Revolutionary 
War. The Writings fully reflects the famous 
"16-character formulation of military principles" -- that is 
"when the enemy advances, we retreat; when the enemy camps, we 
harass; when the enemy tires, we attack; when the enemy 
retreats, we pursue" -- authored by Mao Zedong and Zhu De in the 
early years of the Red Army, and the active defensive strategy 
centered on "luring the enemy to penetrate deeply," which was 
formulated during counter-campaigns against "encirclement and 
suppression." During the counter-campaigns against 
"encirclement and suppression" and strategic retreats, Mao 
Zedong advanced many important military principles on troop 
concentrations, mobile warfare, war of quick decision, and war 
of annihilation. 
  As a distillation of the Red Army's decade-long experience 
of 
pitched battles, Mao Zedong's "Problems of Strategies for 
China's Revolutionary War" displays a mature theoretical 
structure spelling out in a systematic way the abovementioned 
problems concerning strategies for China's Revolutionary War, 
and moreover, examining their philosophical and methodological 
implications. This marks the formation of Mao Zedong's 
thought on military affairs. 
  The second volume of the Writings contains 
244 essays written by Mao Zedong during the War of Resistance 
Against Japan which highlight his theories, lines, principles, 
and policies on the national united front in Resistance to 
Japan, War of Total Resistance, protracted war, and guerrilla 
warfare. 
  The War of Resistance Against Japan was advocated by the 
CPC and pursued under the banner of Anti-Japanese National 
United Front, itself based on the KMT-CPC Collaboration. Led by 
Mao Zedong, the Chinese communists buried the hatchet; valued 
the national cause above all; and made detailed plans for the 
deployment of the Eighth-Route Army and New Fourth Army, 
strategic unfolding, and the prosecution of war. Moreover, with 
a positive attitude, they continuously made suggestions to the 
KMT authorities about providing guidance on a national 
anti-Japanese strategy. Essays such as "Cable to Chiang 
Kai-shek on the Japanese Invasion of the Lugou Bridge," "On 
National Defense," "On the Strategy for the North China Front," 
and "On Strategic Arrangements in North China Following the Loss 
of Taiyuan" underscore problems in this area. 
  Mao Zedong's "On Protracted War" argues most forcefully for 
the general principle of waging a protracted war, and was 
immensely important in providing guidance to the Chinese people 
in winning the final victory in the war against Japan. 
  Mao Zedong expounds fully on the strategic value of 
guerrilla 
warfare in the war against Japan in "On the Principles of 
Warfare for the Red Army" and in many other essays. These 
essays played a key role in the rapid development of guerrilla 
warfare in the war against Japan. 
  One outstanding feature of army building in the war against 
Japan was the insistence on party leadership and the guaranteed 
political, ideological, and organizational independence of the 
Army. Mao Zedong's systematic summing up and incisive analysis 
of army building in the seventh party congress political report 
raised thinking on army building to a new dimension. 
  An important part of the second volume of the 
Works concerns correctly handling the national and 
class contradictions in the war against Japan and the KMT-CPC 
relationship. Early in the Anti-Japanese war period, the 
Eighth-Route Army and the KMT Army were the two forces to bear 
the brunt of fighting on the North China front. For a time, part 
of the KMT Army came under the command of the Eighth-Route Army. 
Regarding this group of KMT troops, Mao Zedong has this to say 
in his cable to Zhu De and Peng Dehuai: "We should care about 
and help them; they should not be assigned the most dangerous 
missions, nor want for food and supplies" (p. 70). He also 
instructed: "We should criticize constructively and make 
suggestions about certain weaknesses with friendly parties and 
armies, and should not laugh at and ridicule them" (p. 130). 
After the fall of Wuhan in October 1938, the KMT diehards 
pursued the policy of passive resistance against the Japanese, 
but active fight against the communists, constantly creating 
frictions with the communists. Mao Zedong laid down the policy 
and measure of struggling against the diehards on just grounds, 
based on our advantage, and with restraint adopted "a militarily 
defensive position," and stressed "unification in fighting 
against the Japanese" (p. 567) to counter the attacks by KMT 
diehards. Led by Mao Zedong, our party was able to adhere to 
correct policies and measures in the national united front 
against the Japanese, and thus ensured victory in the war 
against the Japanese. 
  The third and fourth volumes of the Writings 
consist of 902 of Mao Zedong's essays written during the 
Liberation War period. This was an important stage in the 
development of Mao Zedong's military thinking. The essays 
collected in these volumes highlight Mao Zedong's theories and 
practices in strategic decision, war planning, and the art of 
high command. 
  1. Arriving at a strategic decision, and proposing new 
strategic missions, principles, and methods to achieve these 
missions based on the practical conditions of both our side and 
the enemy. With victory in the war against the Japanese 
and aimed against the reactionary KMT's policy of actively 
preparing for a full-scale civil war, Mao Zedong reminded the 
whole party and Army of conducting prompt strategic changes, 
which consisted of switching the guerrilla warfare to mobile 
warfare and the pursuit of "moving toward the north and 
defending the south." With the outbreak of full-scale civil 
war, Mao Zedong, based on the strength of our side and the enemy 
and on the combat experience of our troops gained early in the 
civil war, formulated the interior-line operations and a policy 
of active strategic defense, consisting of wiping out the 
enemy's effective strength and refraining from seizing or 
holding strongholds. Under the guidance of this formulation, 
our Army scored the momentous victory of smashing the KMT's 
full-scale offensives and countering their selective attacks 
with concentrated forces. When the momentum of the enemy's 
concentrated attacks was spent, but when the PLA still was 
outnumbered by the enemy in total troop strength, Mao Zedong 
made the bold strategic decision to direct the PLA main force to 
attack the exterior lines in order to expand the war into areas 
under KMT rule, thus initiating the historic change in People's 
Revolutionary War from strategic defense to strategic offense. 
Beginning in the fall of 1948, he directed our Army to launch 
in a timely fashion the three great Liaoshi-Shenyang, Huai-Hai, 
and Peiping-Tientsin Campaigns, which basically wiped out the 
KMT main force and shook the KMT rule to its very foundations. 
Thereafter, in a fearless, combative, and triumphant spirit, 
Mao Zedong refused to be duped by Chiang Kai-shek's "peace talk" 
plot or intimidated by the imperialists' threat of armed 
intervention, and made the strategic decision of widening the 
war to the whole country in pursuit of the revolution, thus 
smashing Chiang Kai-shek's hope of rearming himself for a 
comeback on the strength of his half-diminished power base south 
of the Chang Jiang, forcing the imperialist powers to pull back 
from armed intervention, and finally winning the great 
Liberation War. 
  2. Putting forward in a timely fashion a highly 
relevant principle of military operations that was able to meet 
the needs evolved from the development of war and adjust to 
specific conditions of different battlefields. Early in 
the war, in view of the rearmament of the KMT by the United 
States and therefore its greater combat power, Mao Zedong laid 
great emphasis on the principle of "concentrating a superior 
force to destroy the enemy forces one by one." Parallel to this 
was the guiding thought of adhering to the war of annihilation 
and mobile warfare. Regarding areas with heavy concentrations 
of enemy troops, the emphasis was on caution, waiting for an 
opportunity, working for more than instant results, and luring 
the enemy to penetrate deeply. In waging battles that had 
decisive strategic significance, the emphasis was on boldly 
taking over enemy strongholds and heavily fortified cities, and 
launching wars of annihilation on an unprecedented scale. 
The 10 famed military principles summarized by Mao Zedong 
in his "The Present Situation and Our Tasks" embody and 
highlight the guiding principles for all our Army's operations 
during the time of the War of Liberation. 
  3. Great mobility and maneuverability; good at luring 
or drawing away enemies; creating favorable opportunities for 
battles; holding firmly the initiative to launch offensives; and 
handle everything with great flexibility and according to 
changes in enemy movements, time, and locations -- these are the 
obvious characteristics of Mao Zedong's art of high command. 
  Essays in this period also reflect new developments in Mao 
Zedong's thinking on army building. 
  The sixth volume of Works includes 219 
essays written between the founding of the PRC and December 1972 
which trace how Mao Zedong ordered the PLA to continue the 
strategic pursuit; liberate the whole country and certain 
important islands; move troops into Tibet and peacefully 
liberate it; conduct the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid 
Korea; and defend the country, its national security, and 
territorial integrity; and build a modern and regular army for 
national defense. 
  Mao Zedong paid great attention to the construction of a 
powerful, modern, and regular army of national defense. He 
pointed out: We now have come to the highest stage of army 
building, which is the acquiring of modern technology. China 
must build a powerful national defense army, a powerful air and 
naval force, and a good logistical system. He was determined to 
launch research and development of hi-tech weapons, and wanted 
to develop atomic and hydrogen bombs and intercontinental 
ballistic missiles. In line with modernizing army equipment, he 
demanded that the Army be regularized and that it install a 
"centralized command, hierarchy, and establishment, and 
discipline and training system" to instill "organization, 
planning, accuracy, and discipline" (p. 341). 
  Mao Zedong's military thinking sums up the experiences 
of China's Revolutionary War and wars against aggression. It is 
a theoretical distillation of those experiences. It was born in 
revolutionary war practice and continuously developed alongside 
the practice and changes in historical conditions. Today, 
learning and studying seriously the Military Writings of 
Mao Zedong, and appreciating profoundly and acquiring its 
basic tenets, principles, and scientific methods, hold important 
significance for our conscious effort to adhere to Mao Zedong's 
military thinking and Deng Xiaoping's theory on national defense 
and army building in the new era as the guiding thoughts for our 
Army.

  [Excerpts] The provincial people's government held a flood 
resistance and disaster relief teleconference yesterday 
afternoon. The conference made emergency arrangements for 
Fujian's flood resistance and disaster relief work. Since 13 
June, most of Fujian's cities and counties have been hit and 
devastated by a wave of torrential rains and rainstorms. 
According to the preliminary statistics, some 411 townships and 
towns and more than 2.49 million people in the province have 
been hit by the flood that has, to date, left more than 40 
people dead and caused direct economic losses totalling more 
than 3 billion yuan. According to a meteorological report, the 
province is expected to be hit by another wave of torrential 
rain and rainstorms over the next two to three days. [passage 
omitted] 
  Provincial Governor Chen Mingyi delivered a speech in which 
he urged leaders at all levels in the province to earnestly 
strengthen leadership over the province's flood resistance and 
disaster relief work; make every possible endeavor to organize 
and mobilize the broad masses of people to participate in flood 
resistance and disaster relief work; and protect people's lives 
and property. 
  The governor stated: We should pay more attention to each 
and every vulnerable aspect; take necessary precautions; and 
direct more energy to protecting the province's reservoirs, 
dams, drainage systems, key projects, as well as crucial 
installations and facilities. 
  The governor also called on the provincial departments 
concerned to actively and unreservedly assist the afflicted 
areas in combating flood; help those areas provide for 
themselves by engaging in production; and join hands with people 
in the afflicted areas in overcoming current difficulties and 
rebuilding damaged homes. 
  It has been learned that the provincial people's government 
himmediately allocated special funds to help the afflicted areas 
and dispatched some eight work groups to various afflicted areas 
to investigate the flood situation and extend sympathy and 
solicitude to the local people. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Guangzhou, 21 Jun (XINHUA) -- Chen Junsheng, state 
councillor and director of the State Flood Control and Drought 
Relief Headquarters, and a central joint work group led by him 
went to the main dike along the Bei Jiang in Guangdong today. 
They extended their regards to the cadres, people, commanders 
and fighters of the People's Liberation Army [PLA], and officers 
and men of the armed police working on the forefront of 
combating floods there. They fully affirmed the work done in 
the preceding period by the party, government, and army 
organizations in Guangdong in combating floods and dealing with 
emergencies. 
  Chen Junsheng was briefed by Guangdong Governor Zhu Senlin, 
Vice Governor Ou Guangyuan, and other responsible comrades on 
the flood control work along the Bei Jiang dike in the preceding 
period. After inspecting some dangerous sections and spots, Chen 
Junsheng said: An interim success, better than expected, has 
been achieved in the flood control along the Bei Jiang dike. 
The work has been done comparatively well because the 
provincial party committee and the provincial government have 
provided effective leadership, each has attended to its duties, 
the party, the government, the army and the people have made 
concerted efforts, and the officers and men of the PLA units in 
Guangzhou have played a key role at a crucial moment. 
  Chen Junsheng said: While strengthening the Bei Jing dike, 
great attention should be paid to removing silt and obstacles. 
In order to enhance flood regulation capability in the future, 
flood regulation and storage projects should be built over the 
Bei Jiang and the Xi Jiang in the Zhu Jiang valley. 
  Chen Junsheng issued some instructions on Guangdong's flood 
relief work in the next step. 
  At 5 pm, Chen Junsheng and his party went to the flood 
control work site of the PLA units in Guangzhou. On behalf of 
the party Central Committee, the State Council and the Central 
Military Commission, they gave their regards to PLA commanders 
and fighters there, and encouraged the latter to make persistent 
efforts to achieve new success in combating floods. 
  Among the members of the central joint work group were Hou 
Jie, Minister of Construction; He Jing, Vice Minister of Water 
Resources; and General Li Jing, Deputy Chief of General Staff.

  [Text] To further enhance the quality of its propaganda 
and make good preparations for providing Beijing with our radio 
programs, the news station under the Hunan People's Radio 
Network recently conscientiously summed up and analyzed its past 
propaganda work. It will make proper adjustments in its 
programming effective 20 June. 
  The adjusted programming will retain its distinctive 
features 
while giving more prominence to news broadcasting. From morning 
till night, news will be broadcasted at the most important 
times. The former "International News" program carried at 2200 
[1500 GMT] will be moved to 0610 [2210 GMT], and there will be a 
10-minute program called "Night News" to increase efficiency. 
  The previous "Daily Morning News" will be replaced by 
"Yesterday's Guide." In addition, the "738 News Hotline" and 
"738 Live Studio" will be merged and broadcasted from 1810 to 
1855 [1010 to 1055 GMT]. This will enable the program 
presenters to host their program more easily and will encourage 
the audience to participate in the hotline. 
  As part of the change, a small number of specialized 
programs 
will also be adjusted. The "Rural World" program carried at 
1830 [1030 GMT] will be replaced by the "Urban and Rural 
Panorama" program broadcasted at 0730 [2330 GMT] and 2030 [1230 
GMT]. Both "Hunan Night Talk" and "Audience Voice" will be 
dropped in favor of more literature and art programs.

<F P=106> [Speech by Zhang Baifa, executive vice mayor of Beijing </F>
Municipality and vice chairman of the board of directors of the 
China Urban Development Research Society, at the third congress 
of the China Urban Development Research Society, entitled: 
"Priorities of Beijing's Urban Construction" -- on 9 June] 
  [Text] Under the leadership and concern of the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council, Beijing, the capital of China, 
has presented itself before the people in the world with a 
completely new appearance of "ancient cultural city and modern 
city." 
  Beijing is the political and cultural center of China as 
well 
as a center in which China contacts with foreign countries. To 
meet the demand of this nature, Beijing has built, over the past 
40 years or so, some 10 million square meters of buildings for 
the use of administrative organs, foreign affairs offices, 
cultural and sports centers, scientific research institutes, and 
institutions of higher learning. Since the commencement of 
reform and opening up, Beijing has also built a number of 
modernized guesthouses, hotels, diplomatic apartments, and 
office buildings, that are mainly used to do business with and 
serve foreign firms and nationals. The building of these 
administrative, cultural, and international contacting 
facilities has strengthened the function as the capital, and, at 
the same time, promoted the development of the secondary and 
tertiary industries. From 1949 to 1993, Beijing's industrial 
output value rose from 170 million yuan to 125.6 billion yuan, 
and the volume of retail sales of commodities rose from 280 
million yuan to 54.9 billion yuan, thus having greatly enhanced 
the economic strength of Beijing. 
  Meanwhile, Beijing expanded the scope of the areas under its 
jurisdiction on five occasions, with the total area expanding 
from 707 square km to 16,800 square km and with the area of 
plan-covered urban districts developing to 1,040 square km. 
Beijing's permanent population increased from 4.14 million to 
10.51 million, of which, the permanent population in urban areas 
increased from 1.76 million to 6.65 million. The total floor 
space of houses of various kinds increased from 20.50 million 
square meters to 220 million square meters, of which, the floor 
space of residences in urban areas increased from 13.54 million 
square meters to 115 million square meters. 
  Cities are the carrier of economic and social development. 
The more rapidly the economy and society develop, the higher is 
the demand on urban construction. For a municipal government, a 
very important duty is to beef up urban construction with a view 
to providing conditions and service for the development of all 
professions and trades. Since urban construction touches upon a 
multitude of things and trades, it is necessary to give 
prominence to key trades and use them to bring along non-key 
ones. Viewing from the practice in the past and from the 
development in the future, we must, in the content of 
construction, accelerate the building of urban infrastructure 
and residences, and, in the links of work, successfully grasp 
urban planning and the reform of urban construction economic 
structure. Then, I want to give a brief speech on these four 
issues. 
<H5>  1. On the Issue of Firmly and Unswervingly Putting the </H5>
Construction of Urban Infrastructure in the First Place of Urban 
Construction 
  Urban infrastructure is the ordinary condition for the 
production of materials and for the livelihood of the people and 
is the foundation on which a city depends to exist and develop. 
If a plant is cut off from communications, posts and 
telecommunications, water, coal, electricity, gas, and heat 
facilities, its production will be in a state of chaos and even 
stop. If a family is cut off from these facilities, it will 
feel very inconvenient in livelihood and even be unable to lead 
a life. These facilities are even more frequently utilized and 
consumed by guesthouses, hotels, and shopping centers. A city 
will be at a standstill if it is cut off from these facilities 
for a short while and will be at a low ebb if being cut off from 
these facilities for a long period of time. In a certain period 
before the commencement of reform and opening up, Beijing failed 
to put the construction of urban infrastructure in a due place, 
and, therefore, it suffered, like other big, medium-sized, and 
small cities in the country, the shortages of communications, 
postal, and telecommunications facilities, the insufficient 
supply of water, electricity, gas, and heat, poor environmental 
conditions, and the low ability in guarding against natural 
calamities. 
  Over the past 10 years or so since the implementation of 
the reform and open policies, Beijing has regarded the 
construction of urban infrastructural facilities as the primary 
task for urban construction. Over the past 14 years, Beijing 
has invested 29.3 billion yuan in fixed assets of urban 
infrastructural facilities, an increase of 270 percent over the 
figure in the past 30 years before 1979. A group of key basic 
transportation, postal and telecommunications, energy resource, 
water supply and drainage, environmental, and disaster-combating 
projects have been built. 
  Although Beijing has rapidly developed the urban 
infrastructural facilities, it is still confronted with some 
difficulties. To be an internationally modernized large city, 
Beijing should rely on the diversion of water from south to 
north in order to ensure the supply of water for the urban 
areas, place hope on Shaanxi's natural gas supply in order to 
ensure the supply of gas for the urban areas, and vigorously 
develop underground railway tracks and light railway tracks in 
order to alleviate the traffic jams. A considerable number of 
capital must be spent in these huge projects. Thus, the burden 
is heavy. We have not found more feasible countermeasures for 
resolving some of the difficulties, such as central heat supply 
and garbage disposal. To this end, the construction of urban 
infrastructural facilities should be regarded as a priority in 
urban construction. We have to do so not only in the past and 
at present but also in the future. 
<H5>  2. On the Issue of Improving the Living Standards </H5>
  A stable life can set the people's minds at rest. When 
living in peace, the people can work in contentment. Only when 
the people live and work in peace and contentment will society 
be stable, there be a relaxed environment for reform, and the 
economic and social development ceaselessly be elevated to a new 
height. Therefore, Beijing has paid full attention to the 
construction of residential houses. Since the founding of the 
PRC, Beijing has built more than 100 million square meters of 
residential houses, accounting for more than 50 percent of the 
municipality's total houses. Particularly, since the 
implementation of the reform and open policies, the municipality 
has expanded the dynamics of developing new areas and rebuilding 
old towns. So, more than 5 million square meters of residential 
houses were built annually, and about 80,000 to 100,000 
households moved to new houses every year. As of the end of 
1993, there were 115 million square meters of urban residential 
houses, and the per capita land use areas reached 12.5 square 
meters. More than 90 percent of the households attained the 
level of "being seperately accommodated." In the past three 
years, the municipality completely solved the problems for the 
households with housing difficulties whose per capita housing 
area was less than 2 square meters. Through reconstruction of 
the houses in dangerous conditions, the municipality solved the 
housing problems for 56,000 households whose houses were in 
dangerous conditions. More than 70 percent of the houses are 
built with their own kitchens and toilets. The interior designs 
have been developed toward the orientation of "large living 
rooms, kitchens, rest rooms, small bedrooms, and more closets." 
Through overall development, the municipality has strengthened 
the construction of auxiliary facilities. Thus, the living 
environment has noticeably improved. 
  But, the urban permanent population has increased by 4.89 
million due to the rapid development of the urban areas in the 
municipality since the founding of the PRC. Along with the 
long-term implementation of the low-rent welfare housing system, 
nearly 200,000 households are still living in the conditions 
that per capita living space is less than 4 square meters, and 
more than 8 million square meters of dangerous and shabby houses 
are in urgent need of reconstruction. Some 100,000 urban 
permanent population will increase with each passing year in the 
future. So, the municipality's strained housing situation is 
extremely serious. The central authorities set forth the 
requirement for being comparatively well-off by 2000. The 
municipal party committee and government set forth the 
requirement for being fairly well-off three years ahead of 
schedule, including that for being fairly well-off in the 
housing conditions. There are three standards for being fairly 
well-off in the housing conditions. First, the per capita 
housing area reaches 14 square meters. Second, more than 80 
percent of the houses are built with their own kitchens and 
toilets. Third, the problems that the per capita housing area 
is under 4 square meters should completely be solved, and the 
problems that the per capita housing areas are less than 5 or 6 
square meters should partially be solved. It is more difficult 
to attain the third standard. The key to attaining this 
standard hinges on that whether or not the housing problems for 
the households with low and medium-level incomes can be solved. 
To this end, we should focus our efforts on grasping the 
following two tasks in the foreseeable future. 
  First, we should carry out the project to provide 
comfortable houses. On the one hand, we should do a good job in 
registering and verifying the low and medium-income households 
which have housing difficulties, clarifying who and where they 
are and their number. On the other hand, work responsibilities 
should be assigned to every level of different departments and 
different areas to build and collect housing resources through 
five channels. Housing construction funds should be shared by 
the government, the work units, and individuals, with the 
government responsible for the 10 categories of local 
construction taxes and fees, individuals purchasing houses in 
line with the housing reform policies, and work units paying for 
the differential between the construction cost and the 
purchasing price. Meanwhile, it has been stipulated that 
development companies or housing construction units responsible 
for developing and building the houses to resolve people's 
housing difficulties and provide them with comfortable houses 
are not allowed to make profits. In spite of this, there are 
still some individuals and units who cannot afford to pay for 
the houses. In addition to the long-term mortgage loans and the 
housing construction loans provided to individuals and work 
units, respectively, we are studying the plans for resolving the 
housing difficulties of the second batch of households through 
adjustment. 
  Second, we should speed up the renovation of dilapidated 
houses. Many low and medium-income households with housing 
difficulties are living in dilapidated housing areas with few 
houses and a poor living environment. As early as 1990, the 
municipal government put forward a principle to renovate the 
dilapidated houses, which called for shifting the housing 
construction focus from development of new areas to a 
combination of new area development with renovation of 
dilapidated houses; placing the leadership work for renovation 
of dilapidated houses mainly on district and county governments; 
and coordinating renovation of dilapidated houses with the 
development of new areas, with real estate business, with 
housing reform, and with the protection of the styles and 
features of the ancient capital. Over the past three years and 
more, 1.5 million square meters of dilapidated houses have been 
pulled down, and 2.16 million square meters of houses built to 
enable 56,000 households to move to new houses already or in the 
near future. The renovation has become more and more difficult, 
and continuous study is needed to solve new problems and put 
forward new countermeasures. If the urban plan is not further 
improved, it will be difficult to develop the essence and 
discard the dross of the old city. If construction of urban 
infrastructural facilities and key projects is not accelerated, 
it will be difficult to possess even the minimum conditions for 
the renovation. If reform and opening up are not expanded, it 
will be difficult to gain the land price differential through 
real estate business, to make the state, the work units, and 
individuals to share the burdens through housing reform, to draw 
in investment from abroad for our projects, and to raise funds 
for the renovation. 
<H5>  3. The Issue of Developing the "Leading" Role of the Urban </H5>
Plan 
  The healthy development and the fairly great achievements in 
Beijing's urban construction are attributed to a fairly mature 
and continuously improved overall urban construction plan. As 
early as 1950's, Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and other 
revolutionaries of the older generation gave instructions on 
many occasions on Beijing's construction, planning, development, 
and other major issues. Since the third plenary session of the 
11th party Central Committee, Deng Xiaoping and other party and 
state leaders, the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, and 
the State Council have given explicit instructions on the 
principles for Beijing's construction. The State Council again 
officially approved the revised "Beijing overall urban 
construction plan" on 6 October 1993 and promulgated it for 
implementation on 21 February 1994. The new overall plan draws 
a trans-century grand blueprint of Beijing's urban construction 
and development of other undertakings and defines the target to 
be attained, namely to bring Beijing's social development and 
its overall economic as well as scientific and technological 
strength up to or surpass in some areas the levels of the 
capital cities of medium developed countries by 2010 so as to 
lay a solid foundation for building Beijing into a first-rate 
modern international city by the middle of the 21st century. 
  The current task is implementation. For this, we should 
conduct propaganda and education to make the vast number of 
leading cadres and people in all walks of life clearly 
understand that the State Council's written reply and the new 
overall plan are the programmatic and authoritative documents on 
Beijing's construction and that it is necessary to embrace the 
idea of subordinating local interest to overall interest and 
immediate interest to long-term interest and to guide and 
promote the implementation of the overall plan in line with the 
needs of the socialist market economy. Meanwhile, legal, 
administrative, and economic means should be adopted to 
strengthen the management of the plan. Only in this way can we 
implement this scientific plan to the letter and enable it to 
play a leading role in guiding urban construction and management. 
<H5>  4. On the Issue of Accelerating the Reform of the Economic </H5>
Systems Concerning Urban Construction 
  As an organic body, cities have their objective operating 
mechanism. Therefore, there should be a set of economic systems 
concerning urban construction that are suitable for the 
mechanism of cities. Urban construction consumes a huge amount 
of money. From where does the money come? Under the planned 
economic system, the unified state allocations and collections 
were carried out, thus resulting in too much debts and cities 
being operated in an inefficient and disorderly manner. Under 
the market economic system, we should make great effort to 
gradually transit from the unified state allocations and 
collections to self-allocation and self-collection, to effect a 
favorable cycle of input and output, and to make cities have a 
complete and sound organism and reach an efficient and orderly 
state of operation. To realize this transition, we should, in 
the course of continuously carrying out various reforms in urban 
areas, strengthen the reform of economic systems concerning 
urban construction. The focus of this reform is to reform three 
systems and establish five markets. 
  The first system that should be reformed is the urban 
infrastructure investment system. In the form of investment 
compensation, urban infrastructure can be divided into three 
categories: The first category is the compensation by society. 
This category of facilities, such as urban roads, rainwater 
drainage facilities, natural calamities prevention facilities, 
and urban green lands, cannot be calculated and their charges 
cannot be collected from users. Thus, the cost should be borne 
by the whole society through perfection of tax revenue systems. 
The other category is the compensation by markets. The 
facilities covered by this category include water, coal, 
electricity, gas, and heat supply facilities. The products 
provided by this category of facilities can all be calculated 
and thus the cost should be borne by consumers through the 
exchange at equal value on markets. Another category is the 
compound compensation. This category include public traffic 
means and sewage discharge and treatment facilities. The first 
investment in such facilities should be borne by society, while 
their regular operating expenses should be borne by markets. 
Touching upon tax revenue reform and pricing reform, the reforms 
in all categories of urban infrastructure will meet grave 
difficulties and it is impossible to accomplish them at one 
step. However, the later these systems are reformed, the graver 
the waste is, and the more losses the state will sustain. Only 
when the normal and stable investment sources are ensured for 
the above three categories of urban facilities, the banking 
credit can be brought into full play. With a long service life, 
urban basic facilities are built by one generation but will 
bring benefit to several generations. With the banking credit 
as the lever, the funds for building these facilities can be 
raised by one generation but be paid back by several 
generations. The second system that should be reformed is the 
land- use system. Only when we transfer land-use rights with 
compensation can we make the most of land resources, can we 
withdraw the profit gained from the grade difference of land, 
that originally belong to the government, and can we attain the 
goal that what is taken from the land is used in the interests 
of the city. No longer should we beg for food by holding a 
golden bowl in our hands. The third system that should be 
reformed is the housing system. In this reform, we should 
mainly depend on the efforts of the state and units, and then on 
the efforts of individuals. The best way is to sell public 
houses to workers and staff. This reform touches upon the 
interests and the renewal of concepts of numerous households and 
upon the reforms of financial system and wage system of 
enterprises, administrative units, and institutions. Thus, it 
goes without saying that there will be grave difficulties in 
this reform. However, without reform, there would be no way out. 
  The five markets that should be established include the real 
estate market, the building materials and equipment market, the 
project bidding market, the building laborers markets, and the 
technological information market. At present, we should, on the 
one hand, strengthen the management function of the government 
and regulate the markets and should, on the other hand, perfect 
various rules and regulations and standardize markets. 
Particularly, we must make the real estate market more visible 
to the public and make known to the public all the transaction 
behaviors and transaction links. Otherwise, there is no end of 
trouble for the future. 
  The above opinions are offered for your common discussion, 
and your comments are welcomed for those which are inappropriate.

  [Text] Beijing, 23 Jun (XINHUA) -- During his meeting with 
a delegation of the Association for Hong Kong's Former 
High-Ranking Public Functionaries in Beijing this afternoon, 
Vice Premier Qian Qichen said it is extremely important to have 
a stable contingent of public functionaries during Hong Kong's 
transition period. The delegation was led by Chen Naiqiang, 
Hong Kong's former secretary for lands and works. 
  Qian Qichen said: Public functionaries are essential in 
administrative operation. It is necessary to depend on public 
functionaries to ensure smooth take-over of sovereignty, stable 
transition, and the management of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region after 1997. 
  He continued: The Sino-British Joint Statement and the Basic 
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have specific 
regulations concerning the continuing service of public 
functionaries. The purpose of these regulations is to maintain 
the stability of the rank-and-file of public functionaries. 
  Qian Qichen said: "The delegation's visit to Beijing is of 
great significance. We support your setting up the Association 
for Hong Kong's Former High-Ranking Public Functionaries." 
  He said: After Hong Kong returns to the motherland, those 
public functionaries who would like to stay and serve the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region and its residents are indeed 
patriotic people who love Hong Kong. 
  Qian Qichen expressed the hope that the contingent of public 
functionaries in Hong Kong will honestly perform their duties 
and serve the Hong Kong residents in the last few years of the 
transition period. 
  Qian Qichen emphatically said: As a financial, economic, and 
information center, Hong Kong is an economic-type city. It 
should focus on its administration and ensure high efficiency in 
its administrative management. 
  Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, 
was present during the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that it was 
extremely important to stabilize the ranks of Hong Kong's civil 
servants in the transitional period. 
  "This is because Hong Kong's administrative work has to rely 
on its civil servants. 
  "The smooth transfer of power and stable transition as well 
as its special administrative region's management after 1997 
will also rely on them," said Qian at a meeting with a 
delegation from the Association of the Former Senior Civil 
Servants of Hong Kong, led by former Secretary for Land and 
Works Chan Nai-keong. 
  Qian said that both Sino-British Joint Statement and the 
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region make 
clear stipulations on the continuous employment of civil 
servants. 
  The aim is to maintain the civil servants' stabilization, he 
added. 
  Qian described the delegation's visit to Beijing as of great 
significance, adding: "We support you to set up the association 
of the former senior civil servants of Hong Kong." 
  Qian said after Hong Kong's return to the motherland, civil 
servants will serve the government of its special administrative 
region and the Hong Kong residents as well. This is in 
conformity with loving the motherland and loving Hong Kong, he 
said. 
  Qian expressed the hope that the Hong Kong civil servants 
will do their best to be responsible in their work and serve the 
Hong Kong residents well in the remaining years of the 
transitional period. 
  He stressed that Hong Kong is a center of finance, economy 
and information and also an economic city, so administrative 
management plays a leading role and its high efficiency should 
be ensured. 
  Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office 
of the State Council, took part in the meeting.

  [Text] Guangzhou, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general 
secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC), said that 
Special Economic Zones [SEZ's] and the relatively developed 
coastal regions should contribute to the development of a 
unified socialist market economy in China. 
  In a recent tour of south China's Guangdong Province, Jiang 
visited Guangzhou, Foshan, Zhongshan, Zhuhai, Shenzhen and 
Meizhou cities, accompanied by Guangdong Provincial Party 
Secretary Xie Fei and Governor Zhu Senlin. 
  Jiang said the establishment of Special Economic Zones 
reflected an important decision made by the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council, advocated by comrade Deng 
Xiaoping. 
  He said that in the past 15 years, the development of 
Special 
Economic Zones, including Shenzhen and Zhuhai, had accumulated 
valuable experience and contributed to China's reform and 
opening to the outside world. 
  He noted that practice had shown that the establishment of 
the Special Economic Zones was correct. 
  He called for a close cooperation between the Special 
Economic Zones and other regions of the country, the areas on 
the Pearl River delta, the Chang Jiang River delta and the area 
along the Bohai Bay, the coastal and interior regions, and 
central and western parts of the country. 
  He said that all regions should develop their strengths and 
complement each other so as to achieve a coordinated development. 
  He pointed out that central government's determination and 
policies for the development of the Special Economic Zone will 
remain unchanged; the position and role of the Special Economic 
Zones in China's reform, opening-up and modernization drive 
would remain unchanged. 
  He rejected the view that the role of the Special Economic 
Zones would be weakened by China's opening to the world in an 
all-around way. 
  Jiang said that the Special Economic Zones should accumulate 
more experience for China's establishment of a socialist market 
economy, involving accelerated transformation of the management 
system of state enterprises, setting up a modern enterprise 
system, cultivating the market system, formulating a fair income 
system and improving the social security system, and taking part 
in international economic cooperation and joining in the world 
market. 
  The Special Economic Zones should maintain fast and stable 
economic growth through deepening of reform and expanding 
opening to outside world, he added. 
  Jiang called on the zones to make efforts to develop new and 
high-tech industry, enhance management and further improve the 
investment environment. 
  He said that Shenzhen and Zhuhai are expected to make more 
contributions to the resumption of China's sovereignty over Hong 
Kong and Macao and the maintenance of Hong Kong and Macao's 
prosperity. 
  Jiang also gave directions on the ethical and cultural 
development in the Special Economic Zones. 
  During Jiang's inspection of Guangdong, some areas were hit 
by floods. He expressed great sympathy and solicitude time and 
again for the people in the flood-stricken areas. 
  During his stay in Zhuhai city, a workshop of a textile 
plant 
collapsed. Jiang went to hospital to visit the injured workers.

<F P=106> [Article by Hu Qili, Minister of Electronics Industry: </F>
"Develop the Information Industry and the Economic Information 
Network, Promote Information Service for the National Economy"] 
  [Text] I. Developing the Information Industry, 
Establishing a National Economic Information Network, and 
Promoting Information Services for the Economy and Society Are 
Badly Needed for China's Modernization Drive and Are a Great 
Trend in the World's Economic and Technological Development 
  The world's economic development is changing from 
industrialization to an information world. As the pillar for 
the information science, the electronics industry has become a 
strategic industry in the world today. Judging from developed 
countries' course of development over the past decades, the 
electronics industry has played a very crucial role in promoting 
technological progress, carrying out industrial reform, 
enhancing labor productivity, and speeding economic development, 
in the readjustment of the economic structure, and in the course 
of developing human civilizations and promoting social progress. 
The speedy development of electronic technology, especially 
software and information services, has formed the electronic 
information industry -- represented by microelectronics, and 
computer, communications, and software technology -- and 
continues to cause drastic changes in society, the economy, and 
people's lifestyles. 
  The CPC Central Committee and the State Council attach great 
importance to the development of China's information services. 
Not long ago, the State Council officially set up the National 
Joint Conference on Economic Information to organize and plan 
the development of China's economic information services. With 
the direct concern of the top party and state leadership, it has 
been decided to implement the "Three Golden Projects" (Golden 
Bridge, Golden Pass, and Golden Card Projects), thus placing the 
quickening of China's economic information services high on the 
agenda. This is a major policy decision for China's 
modernization and is a strategic measure for achieving the 
second- and third-step goals of national economic development. 
  Promoting information services and integrating them with 
industrialization will greatly enhance the quality of China's 
national economy and will help change the economy from an 
extensive one to an efficient one. China's current economy is 
still in a high-consumption, low-efficiency, and extensive 
pattern of development. Energy consumption and material 
consumption per unit of output value are three to five times 
that of developed countries, the energy utilization rate is 30 
percent, and its total personnel labor productivity is merely 
some 5 percent that of developed countries. Fully developing 
and utilizing information resources and information technology, 
and putting economic development onto the track of relying on 
technological progress can greatly enhance the utilization rate 
of material resources and exceedingly enhance the added value of 
production and labor productivity, as well as bringing into full 
play the role of "science and technology as a primary productive 
force." 
  Promoting information services is an immediate task for 
establishing and perfecting China's socialist market economy 
system and improving macroscopic regulation and control. The 
backwardness of China's information technology means makes it 
impossible to promptly, accurately, and completely collect, 
transmit, and comprehensively process various kinds of economic 
information, including information for banking, finance, 
revenue, foreign trade, domestic trade, and industrial and 
agricultural production. This seriously hinders the State 
Council and governments at all levels in promptly making 
macroscopic policy decisions and carrying out effective 
macroscopic regulation and control, and causes difficulties for 
China in its international economic exchanges. The major 
information system projects and the basic information facilities 
which leaders of the State Council are personally in charge of 
are intended to resolve this salient contradiction at an early 
date. 
  Promoting information services and accelerating the 
development of the information industry will promote the 
modernization of China's industrial structure and of the entire 
national economy. Today, social and economic development 
increasingly depends on information resources, information 
technology, and the information industry. The information 
industry is a leading industry for the modern economy. Its 
importance is reflected not only by its daily increasing output 
value in the national economy, but all the more by its 
"invigorating," "arousing," and "doubling" effects on the entire 
national economy. It has become the driving force for the rapid 
growth of the modern national economy. 
  Promoting information services will be conducive to the 
smooth linking of China's economy with that of the world. 
Information services are becoming a major means of 
international contact and trade exchanges. All big companies in 
developed countries have extensively adopted the use of 
electronic data exchange and electronic mail. Europe and the 
United States already have employed electronic means for 
international trade. If China does not accelerate the process 
of promoting information services, it will directly affect the 
depth and breadth of the opening up to the outside world and 
will weaken China's role in the world economy. 
  II. Insist on the Integration of Production With 
Application and of Manufacturing Industries With the Information 
Service Industry, and Develop the Information Industry in an 
All-Round Way, Thus Offering Information Services for the 
National Economy 
  The electronics industry shoulders a heavy historical task 
in 
the process of promoting information services. In China, the 
electronics industry already has become a new industry of some 
proportions, and is playing an increasingly important role in 
the modernization drive and in supplying information to society. 
In 1993, the total industrial output value of China's 
electronics industry came to 175 billion yuan, and electronic 
products exports reached $8.1 billion. In the past decade, the 
principle of "insisting on application and promoting 
development" has been coordinated closely with all sectors of 
the national economy, with the result that China has obtained 
remarkable achievements in the application of electronic 
information technology. Over the past year, for the several 
major information projects -- especially the "Three Golden 
Projects" -- we have made general plans, evaluated proposals, 
and designed their development, and we have made a gratifying 
step by putting some of them into practice. The general scale 
and technology of China's information industry, however, are far 
from meeting the demand for information services. China has 
very low expertise in the electronics industry and is 
particularly weak in the integrated circuit industry, which has 
become a factor restricting the development of the entire 
electronics industry. At present, there exists a certain degree 
of separation between the industry and the market, as well as a 
lack of coordination between technology imports and scientific 
research and development. This situation, coupled with the 
problems with the mechanism, makes it difficult to concentrate 
strength and capital or to set up large enterprise groups. 
  At present, China's electronic information industry has 
entered a crucial historical period of development, and is faced 
with an unprecedentedly good opportunity and tough challenges. 
Leading comrades of the State Council have pointed out clearly: 
"In organizational reform, the State Council has decided to set 
up the Ministry of Electronics Industry. Although its name 
remains the same as previously, its tasks are greatly different 
from the past. The goal of setting up the Ministry of 
Electronics Industry this time is to strengthen the management 
of the electronics industry across the country under the new 
circumstances. The Ministry of Electronics Industry is the arm 
of the State Council that carries out macroscopic management of 
the electronics industry across the country." It also added: 
"We take the entire information industry as a pillar industry 
for the modernization of the national economy, and we have set 
higher demands and expectations. The tasks with which we have 
charged the Ministry of Electronics Industry are not only to 
produce and manufacture products, but also to attach great 
importance to hardware and the market and to promote applied 
electronic technology. We must seize the opportunity to 
accelerate development." 
  The electronics industry must be aimed at providing services 
to the national economy and society, must continue adhering to 
the principle of integrating production and application, and 
must promote the all-round coordinated development of 
manufacturing industries, information systems, and information 
services. The focal point of development should be based on 
microelectronics, and we should take communications and 
computers as the mainstay, strengthen system integration and 
software-development capability, and offer better full sets of 
electronic system equipment and technological services for the 
development of the national economy and society. It is now 
necessary to concentrate energies on the development of 
electronic information system projects, the emphasis of which is 
on the "Three Golden Projects." 
  The "Golden Bridge Project," which is the State's public 
economic information communication network project, is one of 
the basic facilities for providing economic and social 
information services. It is mutually linked and mutually 
connected with the communication lines of the Ministry of Post 
and Telecommunications and with the special communication 
networks of other ministries. The "Golden Bridge" network can 
transmit data, documents, sound, and diagrams. It will serve as 
a satellite information channel for various information service 
systems, including banking, customs, foreign trade, domestic 
trade, tourism, meteorology, communications, national security, 
and science and technology. It can offer a virtual subnetwork 
for all sectors that intend to set up satellite 
telecommunications networks, reduce duplicate projects, and save 
funds. 
  The "Golden Pass Project" is a preliminary project of the 
"Golden Bridge Project." It will contribute to the service 
system networks of the customs, foreign trade, foreign exchange 
control, and taxation enterprises and departments; promote the 
electronic data exchange service and the electronic mail 
service; and achieve the automation of pass control and 
paperless trade. 
  The "Golden Card Project," which is the electronic currency 
project, will serve banks and related sectors. It will use the 
"Golden Bridge" network to link and perfect the information 
systems of the banking service. It will promote the use of 
credit and cash cards for banks, and gradually will achieve 
electronic cash deposit and exchange, and electronic cash 
payment; reduce the amount of cash people carry with them; and 
offer them convenience. It also will make people lead a more 
convenient and more comfortable life, and gradually will promote 
various electronic value-added services to meet the needs of 
society, as well as offering a reliable communication network. 
  In order to accelerate the implementation of the "Three 
Golden Projects," the Ministry of Electronics Industry should 
proceed from the demand of customers, serve customers, 
coordinate with the departments concerned, strengthen 
organization and leadership, improve overall planning, further 
formulate general technological plans for projects, and 
positively carry out experiments. 
  When it has gained 
experience, it gradually should promote its experience, and then 
must formulate industrial policies, organize related enterprises 
and research academies to carry out scientific research and 
development and large-scale production, offer system equipment 
and services for the "Three Golden Projects," develop China's 
large enterprise groups, and enhance the national strength in 
the course of promoting information services. 
<H5>  III. Under the Unified Leadership and Planning of the State </H5>
Council and With the Close Coordination and Concerted Efforts of 
All Ministries, Commissions, and Localities, We Will Jointly 
Promote Economic and Social Information Services 
  Strengthening the national will and bringing into play the 
government's functions of organization and of planning and 
coordination are an important guarantee for promoting 
information services. The national economic information service 
is a grand social project that cuts across departments, trades, 
and regions, and straddles the next century. It integrates a 
multitude of technologies and a multitude of trades and 
services. Only when we make unified plans, give unified 
commands, unify the pace, properly coordinate relationships 
among all quarters, bring into play the initiative of the center 
and localities and of related departments and enterprises, share 
a division of labor, and make concerted efforts under the strong 
leadership of the State Council can we successfully implement 
them. We must actively and energetically coordinate and 
harmonize with the departments concerned, and assist the State 
Council in offering good service. 
  In promoting information services, we must begin by setting 
standards and standardizing policies, and must do good work in 
standardization and legislation. Promoting information services 
includes the development of basic facilities that serve as 
information channels, and the development of various applied 
information systems. Its huge efficiency lies in the fact that 
the various applied information systems are mutually linked and 
connected through the public information channel, thus fully 
exploiting and utilizing information resources and achieving the 
common use of resources. If we roughly compare basic 
communication facilities to an "expressway," then the various 
applied information systems are the cars running on the 
expressway. Therefore, we must set technological standards and 
agreements for the development of the state's public information 
network, special information networks, and the various applied 
information systems, including all types of equipment and 
software. The information systems to be set up by all trades 
and units must be open, while at the same time guaranteeing the 
confidentiality of secret information. Therefore, promoting 
information services not only requires the development and 
application of advanced electronic technology, but also requires 
reform of the patterns of operation and the management system 
accordingly, as well as standardized government, enterprise, and 
market behavior. Only by means of strong and effective policies 
and laws can we guarantee the orderly promotion of information 
services. 
  When promoting information services, we must insist on 
opening up wider and on strengthening cooperation and exchanges 
with the outside world. Promoting information services is a 
common choice and great trend for the economic and social 
development of all countries around the world. The development 
of the state's basic economic information facilities must 
guarantee international links and adopt common standards. 
Developed countries already have gone a fairly long way in the 
development of information technology, the information industry, 
and in the promotion of information services. Now they are 
developing into high-degree information societies. We can use 
for reference and utilize the technology, experience, personnel, 
management, and capital from around the world, and accelerate 
the development of China's information industry and information 
services through cooperation and exchanges. 
  In short, we should seize the opportunity to accelerate the 
development of the electronics industry, and should positively 
and actively improve service while accelerating economic 
development and promoting information services. This is both an 
unshirkable task of the electronics industry and a rare 
opportunity for the electronic industry as a leading and pillar 
industry to fully play its role. We must adhere to making demand 
our objective and service our aim, change functions, and change 
ways of thinking and work style. We should seize the 
opportunity to accelerate development and make great efforts to 
further upgrade the technological expertise and efficiency of 
the electronics industry.

  [Text] Guangzhou, June 23 (XINHUA) -- The highest flood 
peaks on the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers have passed, said Zhu 
Senlin, governor of south China's Guangdong Province. 
  While inspecting flood control and relief work in Qingyuan 
city on the Beijiang River yesterday, he attributed Guangdong's 
success in combating this flood -- almost the biggest in 100 
years -- to concerted efforts by the armymen stationed in 
Guangdong and local residents. 
  More than 200 people lost their lives in the natural 
disaster, which destroyed 189,000 rooms and ruined crops on 1.2 
million hectares. 
  The flood was caused by successive torrential rainstorms in 
the Xijiang and Beijiang River valleys in early and middle June. 
Major flood monitoring stations on the two rivers recorded 
their highest water levels, all four meters above the danger 
mark. 
  Local governments at various levels in the province have 
paid 
close attention to flood control work, and leading government 
and communist party officials of different localities have gone 
to the flood-fighting front. 
  No breaches of major embankments or reservoirs were reported 
despite the most serious flood in a hundred years, effectively 
protecting the safety of the provincial capital, Guangzhou, and 
the Pearl (Zhujiang) River Delta. 
  But the losses caused by the flood were quite serious, said 
the governor. 
  According to him, 11 million people in the province's nine 
cities and 55 counties were affected, and more than 200 people 
died in the natural disaster, with 189,000 rooms destroyed and 
1.2 million hectares of crops ruined. The direct economic 
losses were set at 10.2 billion yuan. 
  The governor warned that though the flood danger had 
receded, 
the determination to fight possible further floods could not 
slacken, as this is just the beginning: the main flood season, 
which usually begins in late July and early August, has not yet 
arrived. 
  He urged local officials to be on constant alert against 
further possible floods and be meticulous about flood prevention 
and control measures, while doing their utmost to help flood 
victims, assisting them to resume production as soon as possible 
and maintaining social stability.

  [Text] Guangzhou, China, June 23 (AFP)--Disease has broken 
out in flood-ravaged southern China where relief workers are 
battling to contain rising waters, officials said Thursday. 
  Cholera, typhoid and dysentry have been reported in the city 
of Qingyuan, in northern Guangdong province, which has been 
hardest hit by the two weeks of flooding, a provincial 
government health official revealed. 
  The official, who refused to be named, said 15 people in the 
city had contracted cholera, while an unspecified number had 
been affected by typhoid and dysentery, following the worst 
flooding in the area for a century. 
  Drinking water in the area is contaminated, polluted by the 
rotting corpses of drowned livestock, he said. But people are 
still using the water for cooking and washing. 
  But he insisted: "The outbreak is not serious, and we are 
monitoring the situation closely and taking additional measures 
to combat the spread of any disease." 
  Another health official said bottled water, food and medical 
supplies were being rushed to the area from the provincial 
capital, Guangzhou, to alleviate chronic shortages in the 
worst-hit areas. 
  He said a severe shortage of medicine had forced the 
authorities to raid warehouses and shops in search of extra 
supplies. 
  Relief workers have called on both the provincial and 
central 
governments to ship in more emergency supplies to the disaster 
area, the official added. 
  Meanwhile, soldiers continued to reinforce an embankment 
built to keep flood waters off the main Guangzhou and Sanshui 
railway line, by building a second line of defence at the point 
between the two cities where the Beijiang and Sijiang rivers 
meet. 
  Provincial Communist Party secretary Xie Fei visited the 
Beijiang embankment where 500,000 soldiers and relief workers 
have been battling against the rising flood waters for the past 
week. He praised soldiers for their relief work. 
  Sanshui is a strategic point as if it is overrun by the 
water, large parts of the prosperous Pearl River Delta will also 
be at risk of inundation. 
  Rail services on the line were suspended indefinitely on 
Wednesday, cutting off a vital supply line to the flooded 
region, although roads to the area still remain open. 
  Xie is expected in another affected city, Shaoquang, on the 
northernmost point of the province. 
  Guangdong governor Zhu Senlen told reporters Wednesday the 
death toll in the province stood at 210, but government 
officials said Thursday it would rise further as relief workers 
reached villages marooned by floodwater. 
  Zhu said 61 people were reported missing, 4,054 had been 
injured, and that direct economic loss in the area was estimated 
at more than 10 billion yuan (11.6 million dollars) 
  In Guangzhou Thursday, the Pearl River continued to swell 
and 
overflowed its banks in some low-lying areas of the city as 
seasonal tides set in, forcing flood waters back into the city. 
  City officials expected the tide to continue for a further 
three days, and are monitoring the level of the murky water in 
the provincial capital. 
  Guests of some hotels in the city are meanwhile being warned 
not to drink tap water in case it is contaminated and carrying 
disease.

  [Text] Shenzhen, June 22 (XINHUA) -- The financial market 
in Shenzhen city, in south China's Guangdong Province, has been 
operating well since the beginning of this year. 
  According to Wang Xiyi, head of the Shenzhen branch of the 
People's Bank of China, by the end of May, the balance of 
savings of various kinds in the city reached 73.205 billion 
yuan, an increase of 9.483 billion yuan over the corresponding 
figure in January, while the sum remaining after extending loans 
stood at 54.195 billion yuan, up 5.611 billion yuan on January's 
corresponding figure. 
  Wang said it was encouraging that more and more bank savings 
in the city came from fixed deposits, which meant that the sum 
for long-term use is growing. 
  To guarantee enough funds for major enterprises and 
construction of key basic facilities in Shenzhen, the loans 
issued by various banks in the city in June are estimated at 1.6 
billion yuan. 
  The branch head said that though Shenzhen, as a pilot city 
for China's policy of reform and opening to the world, has a 
freer financial environment, there still remained a need for 
effective measures to control inflation there, to strengthen the 
withdrawal of currency from circulation and to prevent the use 
of working capital as investment capital in the form of fixed 
assets.

the county level is in charge of supervision and administration 
of affairs relating to peasant burdens within its own area of 
jurisdiction, the township people's government is in charge of 
supervision and administration of affairs related to peasant 
burdens within townships, while routine operations are to be run 
by rural economic management and administrative departments at 
all levels (hereafter referred to as rural economic

will be calculated on the basis of figures given by the rural 
economic income distribution statistical statement prepared with 
data collected by rural economic administrative departments at 
all levels, according to the statistical method formulated by 
the Ministry of Agriculture and approved by the State 
Statistical Bureau. This amount which is to be calculated on a 
township or village basis will not exceed 5 percent of net 
peasant per-capita income recorded in the previous year. 
  Article 9. The village profit retention comprises a 
provident fund, a public welfare fund, and management fees. 
  1) The provident fund is to be used to finance farmland and 
water conservation capital construction projects, tree planting 
and afforestation work, purchase of fixed assets for production, 
and operation of collective enterprises. 
  2) The public welfare fund is to be used to support 
households enjoying the five guarantees, to subsidize households 
in extreme difficulty, and to finance cooperative medical and 
health care services, epidemic prevention service, woman and 
child care, as well as cultural activities, education, and other 
collective welfare undertakings. 
  3) The management fee is used to pay village and production 
group cadres, as well as expenses for administrative operations.

enterprise, after taxes will pay to the local authorities which 
his residential household registration is attached to, village

the township organ in charge of rural economic administration, 
the final accounts and budget will be discussed and approved by 
the assembly of members of the village collective economic 
organization, and then submitted to the villagers' assembly for 
discussion and approval before they are filed to the township 
people's government for record purposes.

together with the village profit retention final accounts and 
budgets of all the villages under the township's jurisdiction, 
to the county department supervising and administering affairs

and is to be used to finance local public-aided undertakings. 
The nature and use of the township coordination fee as a type 
of collective fund will not be confused or altered. 
  The township coordination fee will not be used to make up 
any 
financial deficits of the township, nor will the sum of the fee 
be divided up and separately collected, managed, and allocated 
by different departments. 
  It is prohibited to place the township coordination fee 
under 
the county management. 
  Article 17. The village profit retention and township

fee which is subject to centralized administration by the 
township rural economic management department will be allocated 
to different special accounts, with specific funds to be used 
only for specific purposes. 
  As far as appropriation of the village profit retention and 
township coordination fees is concerned, an appropriation plan 
will be drawn up according to the quota and proportions fixed by

indiscriminately on an egalitarian basis, nor will they be 
misappropriated, diverted to inappropriate use, or used as a 
financial guaranty. 
  Article 18. The county and township departments supervising 
and administering affairs related to peasant burdens will 
practice a tailor-made auditing system for the allocation,

  [Text] Wuhan, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Central China's Hubei 
Province has launched a "giant program" to restore its prestige 
as an industrial base of the country and raise its overall 
economic strength. 
  Some 79 big industrial groups selected from 11 sectors, 
including the machine building, metallurgical, chemicals, 
textiles, power and petrochemical industries, will be the main 
participants in the program. 
  These groups are now the mainstay of the provincial economy, 
including the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, the Dongfeng Motor 
Vehicle Company, the Jinmen Petrochemicals Plant and the 
Hanchuang Power Plant. 
  The provincial government will adopt preferential policies 
for these enterprises in technical upgrading and implementing 
reform measures in a bid to increase their market share. 
  It plans to increase their sales by an average of 1 billion 
yuan (about 120 million U.S. dollars) each year. 
  The province's fixed industrial assets have come to more 
than 
80 billion yuan (about 10 billion U.S. dollars). 
  A committee made up of members of the provincial economic, 
planning, finance, banking, taxation and science departments has 
been set up to coordinate the implementation of the program.

  [Text] Wuhan, June 22 (XINHUA) -- China's main grain and 
cotton producer, Hubei Province, has stepped up efforts to 
construct agricultural production bases. 
  It has invested nearly 500 million yuan (about 62 million 
U.S. dollars) in building the bases since 1985. 
  The bases are now playing an important role in leading and 
promoting local agricultural production. 
  The province has built 29 grain production bases, covering 
50 
percent of its farmland and accounting for 64 percent of the 
total grain output. 
  Some 14 high-quality cotton bases and 81 farm technology 
promotion centers have also been built in the province. 
  Hubei has obtained loans from international organizations 
totalling 12.1 million U.S. dollars and 250 million Japanese yen 
to carry out agricultural development projects in the Wuling 
mountains and western Hubei. 
  A loan amounting to 48 million yuan from the World Bank has 
also been used to improve soil in the province.

  [Text] The following is a recorded report filed by this 
station's reporter on the front lines of the province's battle 
against the flooding yesterday. 
  [Begin recording] Dear audience, it is now almost noon on 20 
June. I'm reporting in Changshanyuan at the eastern gate of 
Changsha City. This morning, Provincial Party Committee 
Secretary Wang Maolin, provincial Governor Chen Bangzhu, and 
some other provincial party and government leaders arrived here 
in Changshayuan, on the front line of the province's flood 
resistance effort, to direct the fight against the flooding. 
  Governor Chen Bangzhu and vice Governor Zheng Peimin just 
arrived back in Changsha at about 0700 this morning after 
attending a Beijing meeting. As soon as they stepped out from 
the train, they set out for Changshayuan, the front line of the 
province's flood resistance. I interviewed Governor Chen 
Bangzhu here on the spot. 
  [Reporter] How are you, Governor Chen? You have inspected 
some flood-stricken areas in Changsha City this morning. Will 
you please tell our audience something about the province's 
flood situation? 
  [Governor] This year, Hunan has been hit by a flood of a 
severity unseen for the past 100 years in terms of both water 
level and quantity. Over the past few days, the broad masses of 
Army personnel and people across the province have been bravely 
fighting the flood and have been making concerted efforts to 
provide disaster relief to afflicted areas, with the result that 
some of the province's key dams have remained sound and economic 
losses have been reduced to a minimum. 
  I would like to take this opportunity to extend my warm 
regards and thanks to the broad masses of Army personnel and 
people fighting in the front lines of the province's battle 
against the flood. At the moment, the province's flood 
situation remains very serious, because the water level is still 
high. According to weather forecasts and meteorological 
reports, the province is expecting more rain to fall over the 
next few days. We will definitely encounter more hardships and 
difficulties. Under the current circumstances, the broad masses 
of Army personnel and people across the province should further 
step up their work and devote more energy to flood prevention 
and disaster relief work, this being an overriding task at the 
moment. 
  We are full of confidence that, under the leadership of the 
CPC Central Committee and the State Council, the broad masses of 
the Hunan Army personnel and people will be able to overcome the 
difficulties and hardships caused by natural calamities such as 
flooding, waterlogging, and so on and will win a complete 
victory in the on-going flood prevention and disaster relief 
struggle. [end recording]

  [Text] Changsha, June 21 (XINHUA) -- The foreign-funded 
enterprises in central China's Hunan Province have increased in 
number, scale and efficiency, according to a local senior 
official. 
  Now the province has 2,499 foreign-funded enterprises, and 
the actual use of foreign funds amounts to 1.793 billion U.S. 
dollars, said Tao Na, director of the Provincial Committee of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. 
  Last year the foreign-funded firms attained an export volume 
of over 100 million U.S. dollars, more than the total for the 
previous 14 years. 
  Foreign investors have also taken part in constructing and 
upgrading Hunan's five big thermal power plants, the Hunan 
section of the Beijing-Guangzhou highway, the urban construction 
of this capital of the province and the expansion of Changsha 
airport. 
  Meanwhile, negotiations with foreign investors on highway, 
bridge and power plant construction are under way. 
  The province is also using foreign funds for urban 
construction in some big and medium-sized cities, including 
Changsha, Zhuzhou, Xiantan, Yueyang, Hengyang and Changde. 
  Now 25 state-run big and medium-sized enterprises have 
started technical upgrading using foreign funds. 
  In order to speed up its economic development, the province 
plans to hold economic and trade fairs in Hong Kong and Shenzhen 
September 5 to 9.

  [Excerpt] Beijing, 23 Jun (XINHUA) -- Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Wu Jianmin commented on the Korean nuclear issue and 
answered reporters' questions concerning the Rwanda crisis and 
the Yemeni civil war at a press conference this afternoon. 
  On the Korean nuclear issue, Wu Jianmin said: U.S. President 
Clinton announced today that the United States would hold the 
third round of talks with the DPRK in Geneva in early July to 
seek an overall improvement of relations between the two 
countries; and it that would also stop pushing for sanctions 
against the DPRK in the UN Security Council. Meanwhile, the 
DPRK and ROK have reached an agreement on holding preliminary 
talks for a summit meeting between them. We are happy to see 
these positive developments on the Korean nuclear issue and 
appreciate the wise attitude adopted and positive efforts made 
by the parties concerned for a peaceful settlement of this issue. 
  He said: Dialogue, instead of exerting pressure, is the 
basic way for a peaceful and proper settlement of the Korean 
nuclear issue. This conforms to the interests of all parties 
and helps safeguard peace and stability on the peninsula. We 
sincerely hope that all parties concerned will treasure and 
seize upon this important turning point; hold consultations and 
dialogue with an equal, pragmatic, and sincere approach; and 
make constructive efforts to bring about a denuclearized, 
peaceful, and stable Korean peninsula. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beijing, June 24 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
today sent a telegram to the special ministerial meeting of the 
Group of 77 in New York congratulating them on the 30th 
anniversary of the group's founding. 
  "On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the founding of 
the Group of 77 and the convocation of its special ministerial 
meeting, I would like to extend, on behalf of the Chinese 
Government and people, our warm congratulations," Li said in his 
message. 
  "For thirty years, the Group of 77 has made unremitting 
efforts in safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of 
developing countries, breaking up the inequitable international 
economic order and promoting north-south dialogue and 
international economic cooperation," he said. 
  "With major and profound changes in the international 
situation in recent years, the group is facing new tasks and 
challenges," he continued. 
  "At the UN Conference on Environment and Development and a 
number of other important international conferences, the group 
has worked to serve the interests of developing countries and 
made contributions to the achievement of positive results at 
these conferences," the premier pointed out. 
  He noted that "facts show that it is necessary and entirely 
possible for developing countries to close ranks and enhance 
cooperation for a common objective under the current new 
international situation." 
  "Being a developing country itself," Li said, "China has all 
along supported the just stand and reasonable demands of the 
Group of 77 and maintained good relations with it." 
  "Since the beginning of the 1990s, our cooperation has made 
further headway, which has effectively defended the common 
interests of developing countries," he said. 
  "I firmly believe that China and the Group of 77 will 
support 
and cooperate with each other even more forcefully and closely 
in the years ahead," Li added. 
  He stressed that "the Chinese Government and people stand 
ready to work with the Group of 77 for a gradual reform of the 
international economic order and for the common development and 
prosperity of developing countries." 
  The Chinese premier in his message wished every success for 
the Group of 77 special ministerial meeting. 
  The Group of 77, founded in Geneva in 1964, now has 129 
member countries.

  [Text] Beijing, June 23 (XINHUA) -- A top Chinese official 
said here today that the five principles of peaceful 
co-existence are of guiding significance in establishing a new 
international political and economic order even 40 years after 
first being advocated. 
  Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the 
National People's Congress (NPC), told an NPC forum marking the 
40th birthday anniversary of the five principles of peaceful 
co-existence that they "conform to the spirit of the United 
Nations charter and illustrate the fundamental characteristics 
of a new-type international relations." 
  The five principles of peaceful co-existence, namely the 
mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, 
non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal 
affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful co-existence, 
were first formulated by China and later advocated by China and 
its neighboring countries of India and Myanmar (the former 
Burma) in 1954. 
  At that time, Tian said, these principles represented the 
common aspirations of the newly independent nations and their 
peoples. Over the past 40 years, the five principles have been 
accepted by more and more countries and "have played an 
important role in maintaining world peace." 
  Tian said China is not only an advocate but also a faithful 
follower of the principles. The country has established 
diplomatic ties with 158 countries and developed economic, 
trade, scientific and cultural exchanges and cooperation with 
more than 200 countries and regions in the world. 
  The NPC also pursues active exchanges with foreign 
counterparts on the basis of the five principles, establishing 
friendly ties with 130 foreign parliaments and international 
parliamentary organizations, he added. 
  Tian stressed that China will continue to adhere to the five 
principles and will constitute no threat to any state or region, 
even after it becomes stronger economically. 
  "China will forever be a stable factor for peace in the 
Asia-Pacific region and the whole world," Tian said, adding 
"China has never sought for hegemony, nor will it begin to seek 
it." 
  Vice-chairpersons of the NPC Standing Committee Fei 
Xiaotong, 
Lei Jieqiong, Qin Jiwei and Li Peiyao attended the forum. 
Leaders of non-communist parties and the foreign ministry made 
speeches on the birth and development of the five principles, 
and on the ever-growing role the principles play in the 
international political and economic arena. 
  The forum was sponsored by the Foreign Affairs Committee of 
the NPC.

<F P=106> [By reporter Chen Jinjun (7115 6651 6511)] </F>
  [Text] Wellington, Jun 20 (XINHUA) -- Li Tieying, Chinese 
state councillor and minister in charge of the State Commission 
for Economic Restructuring, said here today: China will 
continue to uphold its policy of reform and opening up, 
establish a new market economic structure as soon as possible, 
quicken the pace to make its new economic system compatible with 
international practices, and actively participate in 
international competition and economic cooperation. 
  Speaking at a reception hosted by (Murray Horn), secretary 
general of the New Zealand Finance Ministry, Li Tieying said: 
Doing so "not only serves the fundamental interests of the 
Chinese people but also conforms to the common aspirations and 
fundamental interests of the people in the rest of the world." 
  He said: "Over the past 15 years, guided by Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, China 
made remarkable achievements in reform, opening up, and 
modernization. Its economic structure and operational 
mechanisms underwent profound changes." 
  He added: A situation has taken initial shape in China in 
which the publicly owned economic sector constitutes the 
mainstay while the state-owned, collective, individual, private, 
and foreign-funded economic sectors develop simultaneously, 
compete on an equal footing, and develop together. China has 
made unceasing efforts to extend the scale of reform in 
state-owned enterprises and explore practical ways to establish 
a modern enterprise system. China is cultivating a market 
system, accelerating price reform, and continuing strengthening 
the role of market mechanisms. Instead of trying to directly 
control enterprises by giving them administrative orders, the 
state mainly uses economic and legislative means to indirectly 
regulate and control enterprises. China has set up a 
distribution system in which remuneration according to one's 
work as the principal mode of distribution and various other 
means of distribution serve as supplements. A new social 
security system has also been established. The household 
contract responsibility system, with remuneration linked to 
output, is extensively carried out in China's rural areas. This 
and the adjustment of agricultural produce prices and 
procurement systems have motivated peasants to work harder. 
  Li Tieying said: "China's commitment to a market-oriented 
economy in its reform and opening up is correct. Our cause is 
extensively and wholeheartedly supported by our people. Chinese 
people are marching toward the goal of establishing a new system 
and accomplishing modernization." 
  He added: In 1988, China doubled its gross national product 
[GNP] of 1980 ahead of time, basically realizing the first stage 
of its strategic target of improving the people's living 
standards. We may foresee that our GNP will probably be doubled 
again by the end of the century. By that time, we may achieve 
the second stage of the strategic target of improving the 
people's living standards in advance. China's current major 
task is to promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic 
development by establishing a socialist market economic 
structure so as to ensure the realization of the third stage of 
the strategic target. That is, China hopes to catch up with or 
surpass the present standards of moderately developed countries 
by the middle of the 21st century. 
  Li Tieying said: Developing and strengthening our economic 
relations and cooperation with countries and regions in the 
Asia-Pacific region constitutes an integral part of China's 
overall opening up policy. China is willing to actively expand 
its cooperation with New Zealand in the political, economic, 
scientific, technological, and cultural fields through various 
channels under the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and 
efficiency. 
  The China economic structure investigation delegation, 
headed 
by Li Tieying, arrived in New Zealand on 18 June.

  [Text] Washington, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Russia today agreed 
with the United States to shutdown its plutonium production, and 
the U.S. side pledged 10 billion dollars investment in Russia's 
oil and natural gas production. 
  These agreements were within the 22 documents on cooperation 
in energy, space, environment, nuclear safety and other areas 
between the two countries signed by U.S. Vice President Al Gore 
and Russian visiting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
  The signing came at the end of a two-day meeting of a number 
of U.S.-Russian committees established 14 months ago when 
presidents of both countries met in Vancouver, Canada. 
  Before the ceremony, Chernomyrdin met briefly with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton. 
  According to the accord, the U.S. will invest 10 billion 
dollars in Russia's oil and natural gas production in Sakhalin 
Island as well as widened environmental protection cooperation. 
  The accord on plutonium stipulates that both U.S. and Russia 
stop operation of plutonium production reactors by the year 
2000. Russia has three such reactors in operation, two still 
producing weapons grade plutonium. 
  The joint committees meet twice a year alternatively in 
Washington and Moscow. Gore will head a U.S. delegation to 
Russia in the winter for the fourth meeting.

  [Text] Shanghai, June (XINHUA) -- Esso, the largest oil 
company in the United States, opened a subsidiary here yesterday 
to direct its oil exploration in the East China Sea. 
  The subsidiary, Esso China Ltd., will begin to gather 
seismic 
data in a contract sea block on June 26. 
  Esso and 14 big foreign oil companies, including Texaco, 
Chevron, Shell and Phillips-Arco, are now searching for oil and 
gas over a 64,246 square kilometer continental basin area in the 
sea. 
  In May 1992, the Chinese Government decided to open part of 
the offshore area in the East China Sea to foreign oil companies. 
  On June 30, 1992, the China National Offshore Oil 
Corporation 
opened bids for Sino-foreign joint development of oil in that 
area. 
  Esso and 14 foreign oil companies beat fierce competition to 
win bids to search for and produce oil and gas in 18 blocks in 
the sea, in cooperation with the Chinese corporation. 
  Li May Phipps and Kevin Biddle, both vice-presidents of Esso 
China Ltd., said that they were delighted at Esso's success in 
winning a contract block. 
  The 2,120 sq km block is about 200 km north-east of Wenzhou, 
a port in Zhejiang Province. 
  Biddle said: "We are fully confident of our success in 
exploring oil in the East China Sea." 
  Since oil exploration in the East China Sea began in the 
early 1970s, an oilfield and nine oil-bearing structures have 
been discovered and 27 oil exploratory wells drilled there. 
  After seismic exploration is completed and relevant data 
processed, Esso China Ltd. will choose the best well location to 
drill an exploratory well, he said. 
  Drilling is expected to begin next year, he added. 
  Founded in 1882, Esso is currently searching for oil and gas 
in more than 80 countries. It spent 8.2 billion U.S. dollars in 
investment and exploration in 1993. 
  Esso opened a representative office in Beijing 13 years ago 
as part of its effort to participate in developing energy 
resources in China. 
  Biddle said that over the past ten years and more, his 
parent 
company had spent 200 million U.S. dollars in the search for 
offshore oil and gas resources in China. 
  To date, Esso has drilled 17 wells in two blocks in the 
South 
China Sea, striking both oil and gas there, he said. 
  Moreover, together with Chinese partners, Esso is also 
searching for oil in the Tarim basin in northwest China's 
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, he added. 
  He said he thought that oil and gas resources in northwest 
China are probably even more promising than those in the Daqing 
oilfield in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province and in the 
Shengli oilfield in east China's Shandong Province. 
  Esso's cooperation with China is based on long-term 
interests, he said, adding that Esso will try to expand its 
cooperation with Chinese partners in accordance with the 
principles of equality and mutual benefit. 
  Esso is also willing to invest in energy projects in China, 
such as oil projects, coal projects and power projects, he added.

  [Text] Yinchuan, June 23 (XINHUA) -- A poverty-relief and 
environment improvement project was officially launched recently 
in the mountainous southern part of Ningxia in northwest China, 
with free aid from the United Nations World Food Program. 
  Li Shengrong, the top official in charge of the code-named 
4071 Project, said the project will involve the building of 
reservoirs, pump stations and wells, which will expand irrigated 
farmlands by 3,700 ha. 
  The project will also sponsor the building of 10,000 ha of 
terraced farms, 77 km of roads and water supply works to quench 
the wide thirst felt both by humans and stock, Li said. 
  Li said the project will teach 31,900 to read and write, 
reducing the local adult illiteracy rate from 36 percent to 18 
percent. About 64,000 farmers, 28,000 of them women, will be 
trained in various farming skills. 
  The project will be aimed at setting up a network of 
extension stations for the promotion of new stock and crop 
breeds and better farming skills and machines. 
  Massive afforestation efforts under the project will improve 
the local environment and alleviate the shortage of animal feeds 
and fuels, Li said. 
  The three counties involved in the project, namely Guyuan, 
Pengyang and Longde, account for 59 percent of the autonomous 
region's area, where poor resources, infertile farms and 
frequent natural disasters have made the area one of the poorest 
places in China. 
  According to the authority, the three counties now have 
639,000 people living under the official poverty line. 
  Project 4071 will cost 150 million yuan, of which half will 
be funded by 80,500 tons of grain donated by the United Nations 
World Food Program, Li said. The first batch of 14,500 tons of 
grain are expected to arrive by September. 
  In five years when the project is completed, the authority 
hopes that the local grain production will be double its current 
figure, and the average income of local farmers will rise above 
the poverty line. 
  To ensure the work quality of the project, Li said the 
project authority has invited experts and senior management 
staff to provide technological supervision and consultancy 
services.

  [Text] Washington, June 23 (XINHUA) -- The actual U.S. 
agricultural sales to China last year exceeded 500 million U.S. 
dollars, although the official figure was 372 million dollars, 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture said today. 
  The official statistics, the department's foreign 
agricultural service said, "do not reveal the true level of 
trade with China," and re-exports to China from Hong Kong and 
informal trade should be included. 
  According to the department's latest agriculture trade 
highlights, most of the U.S. agricultural sales to China are 
bulk products such as wheat and cotton. Forest products sales 
are also significant. 
  It estimated that in 1993, total U.S. consumer food 
shipments 
to China were 221.8 million dollars, six times greater than 
official direct shipments, making China the 12th largest U.S. 
consumer food market. 
  Among the most popular U.S. consumer food in China, 
according 
to the report, are poultry meat products, such as chicken paws 
and wings, in addition to snack foods, including fruit and nuts, 
and fresh fruit.

  [Text] New York, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Business leaders 
attending the conference on business opportunities in China here 
today were not just talking, many of whom had already gained 
experience of doing business there. 
  Their successful stories, strategies to tackle the China 
market, practical ways of doing business, the difficulties and 
obstacles they encountered there and the cultural differences 
were shared among the meeting attendants. Most of the speakers 
agreed the chances were there, the challenges there, but the 
important thing now was how to get down to real business. 
  The conference on business opportunities in China was held 
with participants of big name companies in the United States and 
some businesses from Asia-Pacific region. 
  The two-day conference, organized by World Congress Inc. and 
sponsored by Nynex Company (New York telephone company) in New 
York, drew some 100 representatives from business companies, 
government agencies and research institutions. 
  Well-known names such GM-Hughes Electronics, Export-Import 
Bank of the United States, Dupont Company, McDonnell Douglas and 
the National Committee of U.S.-China Relations were presented at 
the conference, which as the world congress said, was the first 
of a series on global market. 
  At the conference entitled "Business Opportunities in the 
People's Republic of China", companies, which have been 
successful in their business there, such as GM Hughes, Dupont 
and McDonnell Douglas shared their experiences and exchanged 
ideas in the conference. 
  Different from some other meetings on China, it not only 
dealt with macro topics such as building on China's past to move 
into the 21st century but also micro ones such as ways to 
overcome transportation obstacles in China. 
  Arthur Wilson, director of the Nynex's China liaison, said 
that his company was very much interested in China market, 
especially the extensive telecommunication needs throughout 
China. 
  According to him, Nynex, which will turn its expertise in 
northeastern America into international operation, was always 
willing to help China's telecommunication companies and 
organizations improve and promote the communication system there. 
  In an interview with XINHUA, Charles P. collins, managing 
director of the International Business Network, which has 
operated a China business information program on its computer 
system, noted that there were great opportunities to do business 
in China and the interest was still growing. So to cope with 
the need of original information about China, his company 
established the China program on-line service to help foreign 
businessmen get first-hand information about China. 
  Now that with interest in China becoming more and more 
specific, Vidar J. Jorgensen, managing director of the world 
congress, said that his congress was planning another conference 
next year. 
  The conference is expected to cover finance, financial 
service and investment and actual operations, he said. People 
were now not only satisfied in talking about opportunities but 
also the real business.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Third-round talks 
between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the 
United States aimed at finding a solution to the nuclear issue 
and improving relations between the two countries are to be held 
in Geneva in the first week of July. 
  A DPRK spokesman said: "We expect the talks to be on a fair 
and equal basis so that a substantial agreement may be reached 
for a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue and for the 
improvement of relations between the DPRK and the United States 
as a whole." 
  Meanwhile, the DPRK also announced today that it will allow 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Vienna-based 
U.N. nuclear watchdog, to keep its two inspectors and monitoring 
equipment in place at the Yongbyon facility. 
  In Washington, President Clinton said Wednesday [22 June] 
that Pyongyang has agreed to freeze its nuclear program, adding 
that Washington would now resume diplomatic talks and drop a 
call for U.N. sanctions. 
  "Although these developments do not provide a solution to 
the 
problem they do mark a new opportunity to find a solution," 
Clinton said at a news conference.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has agreed that two inspectors 
from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) can continue 
their work at the country's nuclear facilities. 
  Ho Hyo-pil, vice director of the secretariat [title as 
received] of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the 
Fatherland, said that the decision followed a request by the 
IAEA. 
  He said that it reflected the DPRK's magnanimity and served 
to prove the transparency of its declared peaceful purpose of 
nuclear development. 
  The two IAEA inspectors arrived in Pyongyang on May 17 to 
carry out checks at the Yongbyon radiochemical laboratory. 
  On June 13, the DPRK announced its withdrawal from the IAEA, 
the world's nuclear watchdog body, and refused any further IAEA 
inspections of its nuclear facilities from that date. 
  This followed an IAEA decision on June 10 to impose 
sanctions 
against the DPRK. 
  At a press conference today, Ho distributed a memorandum, 
prepared by the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the 
Fatherland, which accused South Korea of stockpiling plutonium 
in secrecy and itself being engaged in the development of 
nuclear armaments. 
  The statement included a strong protest against what was 
described as the IAEA's "injustice" and "double standards" over 
the nuclear issues of the South and North sides of Korea.

<F P=106> ["Beijing political situation" column by Jen Hui-wen (0117 </F>
1979 2419) on 22 June 1994 in Beijing: "Inside Story About 
China Briefing DPRK on How To Act"] 
  [Text] The situation on the Korean peninsula has been 
relaxed and tense intermittently over the past year or so due to 
the dispute concerning the nuclear issue in the DPRK. However, 
since mid-June, when former U.S. President Jimmy Carter went to 
Pyongyang on invitation to hold talks with DPRK President Kim 
Il-song, the situation has eased. U.S. President Bill Clinton 
has said that there are signs of a solution to the dispute over 
the DPRK, the U.S. representative to the UN has also suspended a 
plan to propose sanctions against the DPRK in the UN and has 
begun to study the credibility of Carter's report, and the ROK 
has suggested to the DPRK that a South-North preparatory meeting 
be held on 28 June in Panmunjom. In view of this, the 
international community generally thinks that Carter has been 
successful in his role as a "peace envoy." 
<H5>  Kim Il-Song Changes and Adopts a Softer Stance </H5>
  Then what has been the change in the DPRK's position after 
Carter and Kim Il-song held talks? According to information, 
Kim Il-song expressed three basic points on behalf of the DPRK: 
First, the DPRK is willing to solve the dispute through talks 
with the United States, and if the DPRK can obtain diplomatic 
recognition from the United States, as well as assistance with 
light-water reactors from the United States or other countries, 
then the DPRK may freeze its current 200,000 kw atomic energy 
program; second, the DPRK is very pragmatic and realizes that it 
is no longer possible to promote communism in the ROK, so the 
DPRK will not launch an attack against ROK, however, if some 
people bring war to the DPRK, then the DPRK can only accept the 
challenge; and third, the DPRK does not want to be a victim of 
power politics and pressure and it cannot accept being a country 
with no military secrets, nor can it accept inspections of 
everything by international organizations as this is an issue of 
an independent country's sovereignty which cannot be violated. 
The first two points in the DPRK's position show a softer 
stance. Precisely because of this, the United States is no 
longer asking the DPRK to explain the 1989 incident (in 1989, 
the DPRK removed used nuclear fuel from its reactor at Yongbyon. 
The United States thought the DPRK might have used the nuclear 
fuel to make plutonium, which is required for a nuclear bomb, so 
it has been demanding an explanation from the DPRK), but has 
stressed the current action. Of course, while the United States 
is adopting a more moderate attitude toward the DPRK, this is a 
step taken by it to redevelop [its relations] with Asia. 
  Regarding the third point of the DPRK's position, an expert 
on international problems in Beijing has said that this is the 
minimum demand of a sovereign country and is no cause for 
criticism, and the United States and the IAEA should not push 
excess demands over nuclear inspections in the DPRK. 
Furthermore, not long ago, the DPRK complained to the IAEA that 
it had acted favorably toward other countries but unfavorably 
toward DPRK. The DPRK had doubts and asked the IAEA: Japan now 
has a stock of plutonium which is enough for 100 nuclear bombs 
(the DPRK's plutonium is only enough to make a single nuclear 
bomb at most), both India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons, 
while Taiwan and South Africa are carrying out nuclear 
cooperation, while the United States is shipping many nuclear 
weapons to the ROK, but you do not say a word and just stare at 
DPRK. Is this fair? What the DPRK has said is not 
unreasonable. To put it bluntly, the United States wants to use 
this chance to topple the DPRK, and this is a component of U.S. 
strategy to carry out peaceful evolution in the socialist 
countries, therefore, it can hardly avoid evoking a strong 
reaction from the DPRK. In fact, the DPRK also wants to join 
the international community, but it cannot tolerate a change in 
its current system. If the United States looks only at the 
latter point, the consequence will be serious. Now, after 
Carter's mediation, the situation has temporarily eased, but the 
problem has not been completely solved. 
<H5>  Liu Huaqing Discusses Strategy With Choe Kwang </H5>
  The easing of the situation on the Korean peninsula is also 
inseparable from China's role. Regarding a solution to the 
nuclear crisis in the DPRK, the United States has always wanted 
China to influence the DPRK. Although China has said publicly 
that it "has a limited role to play" and "not much to do," in 
fact, it has done a great deal of work regarding the DPRK. 
  Informed sources in Beijing disclosed that on 9 June, CPC 
General Secretary Jiang Zemin attended a forum held by the Army; 
when he talked about the nuclear dispute in the DPRK, he pointed 
out that China's steadfast position is to promote a nuclear-free 
Korean peninsula and safeguard peace and stability on the Korean 
peninsula. He disclosed that China had sent a party, government, 
and military delegation to the DPRK led by Ding Guangen, a 
member of the Political Bureau; Wen Jiabao, an alternate member 
of the Political Bureau; Wang Ruilin, a director of Deng's 
office; and Li Desheng, an old general. 
  The delegation 
explained China's abovementioned position to Kim Il-sung and 
indicated in concrete terms that if the DPRK pursued 
construction, China would do what it could to support it; if the 
DPRK developed nuclear weapons, China would be opposed to this; 
and if the DPRK was attacked by war, China would fulfill [lu 
xing 1462 5887] the Sino-DPRK Treaty. The delegation also 
invited Kim Il-sung to visit China in October to participate in 
China's 45th National Day celebration. 
  In mid-June, a DPRK military delegation led by Choe Kwang, 
chief of the general staff of the Korean People's Army, visited 
China. Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the CPC Central Military 
Commission, talked sincerely with the delegation and hoped that 
the DPRK could fight on just grounds to its advantage and with 
restraint to win sympathy and support from the international 
community. In concrete terms, first, it should never take the 
initiative in causing trouble; second, its reaction to pressure 
from the international community should not be stronger than the 
pressure itself; third, in order to avoid friction, the armed 
forces at the demarcation line should be moved further from the 
contact line; and fifth, a political solution is the best 
strategy, stalling is the second best strategy, conflict is a 
bad strategy, and taking the initiative to launch an attack is 
the worst strategy. It should not emphasize the word 
"fighting," it should emphasize the word "talking." 
  The expert on international problems in Beijing pointed out 
that, out of the consideration for peace and stability on the 
Korean peninsula, the Asian region, and even the world, China 
has constantly upheld the principle of not exporting nuclear 
weapons technology, and for this reason China has been 
criticized by the DPRK. However, on the matter of how the 
nuclear crisis can be solved, China still sincerely suggested to 
the DPRK that this is the strategy it should take. Judged from 
the position stated by Kim Il-song when he held talks with 
Carter, the effects of this strategy can be seen. 
  According to informed sources, China has always been very 
concerned about the situation on the Korean peninsula. When the 
situation became tense, China's State Council held a special 
meeting on 30 May to discuss the situation on the Korean 
peninsula. The meeting was presided over by Premier Li Peng and 
Qian Qichen, vice premier and foreign minister, gave a report. 
<H5>  DPRK Has Yet To Understand the Way To Build a Strong Country </H5>
  Qian Qichen said at the meeting: "Promoting a nuclear-free 
Korean peninsula and safeguarding peace and stability on the 
Korean peninsula are basic goals persistently upheld by the 
Chinese Government regarding the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula. These two goals conform to the basic interests of all 
countries in the East Asia region and should become a basic 
starting point in seeking a proper solution to the current 
problem." 
  Qian Qichen pointed out: "When faced with difficulties, the 
relevant sides must all the more stay calm and exercise 
restraint, must not rashly close the door to talks, and must try 
their best to allow room for and the possibility of talks to 
solve this problem. Sanctions are not helpful in solving the 
problem, could intensify the conflict, and may lead to 
consequences which no one wants to see." 
  He stressed that patient talks participated in by four 
parties and three sides (the DPRK, the ROK, the IAEA, and the 
United States) will have more practical effects than a solution 
sponsored by the UN. 
  Li Peng said that the DPRK should devote itself to 
developing 
its economy, then it would have more room for maneuver and 
greater influence. 
  The expert on international issues in Beijing thought that 
when China disapproves of the pursuit of nuclear weapons by the 
DPRK but supports its economic reform, it is in fact pointing 
out the way for the DPRK to build a strong country and bring 
affluence to its people. Obviously, so long as the economy is 
developed and comprehensive national strength is increased, 
foreign pressure will naturally decrease. However, it has been 
alleged that whenever senior DPRK officials hear China chanting 
the economic gospel, they become impatient. They still do not 
think; what a pity!

  [Text] Canberra, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese State 
Councilor Li Tieying said today that foreign trade has played a 
prominent role in China's economic development. 
  In 1993, the total volume of China's import and export 
accounted for over 35 percent of its GNP, measured with the 
internationally accepted indicators, Li told the Australia-China 
Business Council in Melbourne this noon. 
  "Since 1979, China's total volume of foreign trade has been 
growing at an average annual rate of 16 percent," Li said in a 
speech at the luncheon in honor of him by the Council. 
  Li said that this rate is higher than the growth rate of 
China's GDP and that of the world trade during the same period. 
  Li, who is also minister in charge of the State Commission 
for Restructuring the Economic Systems, arrived in Melbourne 
this morning for a nine-day visit to Australia after ending his 
tour to New Zealand. 
  He told the host that China has maintained favorable trade 
terms and its foreign exchange reserve is kept at the normal 
level, reaching 21.2 billion U.S. dollars at the end of last 
year. 
  Li said that it is China's basic national policy "to further 
expand its opening-up to the outside world, vigorously develop 
its foreign trade and widely involved itself in international 
cooperation and exchanges." 
  Last year, China's total import stood at 104 billion U.S. 
dollars and is estimated to reach 1,000 billion U.S. dollars in 
the next seven years. 
  "China's development cannot be achieved without cooperation 
with other countries," Li said. 
  He also said that "China's development and cooperation with 
other countries are also important for the promotion of world's 
economic and trade development and the maintenance of global 
peace and stability." 
  On the Sino-Australian bilateral economic relations, Li said 
that last year, the two countries enjoyed a two-way trade of 
three billion U.S. dollars, up nearly 29 percent on the previous 
year. 
  Australia has so far invested in over 1,300 projects in 
China, with a total contracted investment of 1.25 billion U.S. 
dollars, making it the ninth largest investor in China. 
  China has also set up over 70 non-trade enterprises in 
Australia, with a total investment of 400 million U.S. dollars. 
  Li said that the two countries have broad prospects for 
cooperation in the fields of economy, technology, culture and 
education.

El Abidine Ben Ali received Luo Gan, Chinese state councillor 
and secretary-general of the State Council, at the Carthage 
Palace in the Tunisian capital today.

national economy and in tackling the problems of food, clothing 
and housing. 
  The Tunisian head of state described relations between his 
country and China as excellent, emphasizing Tunisia's wish to 
promote bilateral ties of friendship and cooperation in all

safeguarding national sovereignty and independence, developing 
the national economy and raising the living standards of the 
Tunisian people.

  [Text] Beijing, June 24 (XINHUA) -- A New Zealand trade 
delegation comprising 70 enterpreneurs is now in China, probing 
new investment and cooperation opportunities. 
  The delegation, the largest ever from that country, led by 
Minister of Trade Negotiations Philip Burdon, is expected to 
lead to a new "investment wind" blowing from the South Pacific 
island nation, trade officials from both countries believe. 
  In the trade group are representatives from New Zealand's 
leading enterprises, such as Fletcher Challenge, Calt Halt and 
the Lion Company, which have already invested in China. They 
will tour Tianjin, Suzhou, Chongqing and Guangzhou to discuss 
specific cooperation projects with local officials in addition 
to holding two trade seminars in Beijing and Shanghai, 
respectively. 
  In his talks with Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation Wu Yi, Burdon said that his country 
attaches great importance to developing trade and economic ties 
with Asian countries, China in particular. The New Zealand 
Government has also launched the "Asia-2000" strategic plan 
targeting the shifting of its trade focus from the traditional 
European markets to Asia. 
  With the implementation of the plan two years ago, New 
Zealand-China economic ties have entered a new stage in which 
sole trade has given way to a variety of methods of economic 
cooperation. China so far is New Zealand's tenth-largest export 
destination and its sixth-largest import source, involving a 
total trade volume of more than 500 million U.S. dollars last 
year, a rise of 14.5 percent over 1992. 
  The first quarter of this year saw the bilateral trade rise 
to more than 93 million U.S. dollars, up 12.6 percent over the 
same period of last year. Chinese exports are mainly garments 
and textiles and electronic appliances, and imports are mainly 
resource-based products such as wool, timber, coal and iron ore. 
  As a traditional capital absorbing country, New Zealand has 
in recent years encouraged its enterprises to invest in China. 
By the end of last year New Zealand had invested in 148 
enterprises in China involving a total capital of nearly 70 
million U.S. dollars. Last year alone they set up 76 joint 
ventures in pasture development, feedstuffs, woolen textiles, 
fishing, computers and inland oil exploration. The total 
contracted capital of 44.5 million U.S. dollars was more than 
the previous year's total. 
  A New Zealand trade official said that the investment wind 
is 
expected to blow stronger along with China's economic 
development and opening drive. 
  Over the past few years Chinese enterprises have also 
invested in New Zealand. They run more than 20 joint ventures 
with investment much larger than that poured by New Zealand into 
China.

  [Text] Tunis, June 24 (XINHUA) -- Faruq Qaddumi, chief of 
the PLO Political Department, met with Luo Gan, state councillor 
and secretary general of the Chinese State Council Thursday [23 
June] night for talks on the latest Palestinian developments and 
bilateral relations. 
  Qaddumi briefed Luo Gan on the latest developments in the 
implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement on self-rule 
in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, saying, "the implementation of 
this agreement ushers in a new phase" for the Palestine 
Liberation Organization. 
  He explained that although the PLO encounters some problems, 
it is committed to the peace process in the Middle East and is 
seeking to attain a final goal of restoring all legitimate 
rights of the Palestinian people. 
  The Chinese official said that reaching an agreement on 
Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho between the 
PLO and Israel and its implementation is a major breakthrough in 
the Middle East peace process. 
  He expressed his belief that despite hurdles on the way of 
implementing the agreement and the future Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations, the Middle East peace process will forge ahead so 
long as all parties concerned adopt realistic positions. 
  The Chinese official said that the PLO will have to handle 
several challenges in the forthcoming stage, such as economic 
development, social stability and upgrading the living 
conditions of the Palestinian people. 
  He voiced confidence that the PLO will pursue a policy which 
will best guarantee successful implementation of the self-rule 
agreement so as to provide a sound basis for an overall and just 
settlement of the Middle East issue and regain the legitimate 
rights of the Palestinian people. 
  The Chinese official said that the government and people of 
China will as always support the peace process in the Middle 
East and contribute to the Palestinian economic reconstruction. 
  The Chinese official arrived in Tunis Tuesday on a four-day 
good-will visit to Tunisia and is scheduled to leave for Libya 
later today.

<F P=106> [By Rain Ren, Sally Blyth and Chip Tsao] </F>
  [Text] Chinese officials have indicated that they are not 
prepared to make significant concessions at today's long-awaited 
meeting of the Sino-British airport committee. 
  These unexpectedly negative signals came as yesterday's 
meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group ground to a halt 
when Guo Fengmin, the leader of the Chinese team, told British 
officials that he was unable to hold further discussions on 
issues remaining on the table. It is understood that the 
Chinese negotiating team is waiting for fresh instructions from 
Beijing on the crucial issue of the handover of military land. 
  The main Chinese objection to Britain's position appears to 
be China's unwillingness to give the Legislative Council a final 
say on funding for redevelopment of the military lands, 
particularly the new naval base. 
  Recent indications of China's willingness to be flexible 
over 
the level of government equity injection in the airport project 
have produced high hopes of a successful outcome for today's 
one-day airport committee meeting. 
  However, Chinese officials have described these high hopes 
as 
"unrealistic". 
  In a newspaper interview published on Wednesday, Lu Ping, 
the 
director of China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office said that 
Beijing would be prepared to countenance a level of debt for the 
airport project higher than the $5bn [billion Hong Kong dollars] 
level, which had been China's previous bottom line. 
  But Lu was also careful to stress that progress on the 
airport talks depended on the "attitude" and the "co-operation" 
of the British -- a point emphasised by Chinese officials last 
night. 
  British diplomats are also pessimistic about the outcome of 
today's talks because of the mixed signals coming out of Beijing. 
  Although the outlook for the talks is bleak, neither team is 
prepared to totally discount the possibility of an agreement. 
  After yesterday's JLG meeting it was suggested that a 
separate experts' meeting on military lands, which has been held 
simultaneously with the JLG, could continue over the weekend but 
no agreement was reached on when it would reconvene. 
  Aside from the problem of Legco's role in funding 
arrangements for the redevelopment of the military sites, it is 
understood that disagreement persists over the size of the new 
naval base to be built at Stonecutters Island. 
  Britain has been insisting that the price for developing a 
larger naval base at Stonecutters will be a shortfall of funds 
to refurbish military facilities elsewhere in the territory. 
  China's objections to giving the Legislative Council a 
primary role in determining the funding for the redevelopment of 
the sites stems from its insistence that Legco is merely an 
advisory, colonial body, not a decision-making institution. 
  Britain, however, would find it difficult to accept an 
agreement which excludes the role of Legco in determining the 
funding proposals. Nor can it agree that British funds will be 
used to make up the difference if Legco only agrees to the 
partial provision of the financing agreement recommended by the 
JLG. 
  A senior British official said Britain was trying to work 
out 
a compromise formula. 
  "You have to have provisions which enable the thing [the 
fund] to be put into effect. If the Chinese side does not like 
the way in which the money is made available, then we have to 
look at other ways. We have to find some wording which does not 
openly contradict the position of both sides. 
  "Equally, Britain will not accept the obligation to pay if 
Legco denies the money. Both sides will have to find a 
phraseology to make sure, from the legal point of view, that 
neither side's position is compromised unacceptably, otherwise 
there is obviously no deal," he said. 
  The Governor, Chris Patten, yesterday tried to put a 
positive 
slant on the adjournment of the JLG meeting. 
  "We've [been] talking about the future of the defence estate 
for about seven years. That is an indication of how difficult 
and complex the issues are," he said. 
  "I think that it's fair to say that both sides have been 
working extremely hard over the last few weeks to try to put an 
agreement in place as soon as possible. It is complicated. It 
is difficult."

<F P=106> [From the "Chinese Economic News" column: "Six Guidelines </F>
for the Flotation of Mainland Firms in Hong Kong"] 
  [Text] Ma Shuping, deputy director of the Accountant 
Office of the Finance Ministry, has stressed the following six 
principles on the question of the flotation of mainland firms in 
Hong Kong: 1) The enterprise must implement China's accounting 
system. It is international practice to follow the accounting 
standards of the enterprise's home country. 
  2) When an enterprise is listed on the Hong Kong market, it 
should prepare balance sheets in light of international or Hong 
Kong accounting standards. Although the "experimental system" 
and the accounting operation and statistical systems have 
approached Hong Kong's accounting standards, there are still 
differences between mainland statistics and Hong Kong's 
prevailing practices. To help Hong Kong investors understand 
and analyze the financial status of the listed companies, the 
financial reports presented by the company to the shareholders 
should follow China's accounting standards and regulations as 
well as international and Hong Kong accounting standards. 
  3) When the shareholding company is set up, the listed 
enterprise should implement the "experimental system." The 
provisions governing shareholding companies should be followed 
for endorsing the establishment of a company, namely, "a company 
is established and becomes a corporation after it registers with 
the industrial and commercial administrative management 
authorities." 
  4) The implementation of the "experimental system" will not 
be retroactive. To provide a comparable financial report, the 
auditing report submitted by the registered accountant should 
readjust the balance sheet of the previous years and reckon the 
achievements of the previous three years in light of constant 
prices. This does not affect the actual situation of a certain 
accounting system already practiced in an enterprise. 
  5) The time and method for evaluating transfer accounts. 
According to provisions, when an enterprise is transformed into 
a shareholding company, its assets must be evaluated, and the 
face value of the original enterprise must be readjusted in 
light of the values defined in the evaluation. There are two 
points which should be clarified: First, when the accounts 
should be transferred. The accounts can be evaluated and 
transferred only after the enterprise has been transformed to a 
shareholding company. Second, how the accounts should be 
transferred. The floating capital, long-term investment, and 
invisible assets should be transferred in light of the value and 
face value defined in the evaluation. The original value and 
accumulated depreciation of the fixed assets should be 
reevaluated. The net value of the fixed assets should be 
calculated by deducting the estimated depreciation from the 
reevaluated original value. 
  6) Public welfare funds should be placed under the 
shareholders' control. In accordance with the law and 
administrative rules, a shareholding company should draw a 
certain proportion of public welfare funds from its after-tax 
profits. Public welfare funds should be under the shareholders' 
control. The fixed assets purchased by an enterprise with 
public welfare funds are considered part of the enterprise's 
assets. Any gains or losses which result from the disposal of 
these assets should be regarded as income or expenses from 
enterprise operations and should be included in the enterprise's 
total profits or losses.

  [Text] Haikou, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Rapid progress has been 
made in agricultural development projects in Hainan Province, 
China's largest special economic zone, thanks to investment by 
Taiwanese businessmen. 
  By the end of last year, there were 121 Taiwan-funded 
enterprises in farming, forestry, animal husbandry and fisheries. 
  Most of the enterprises were set up in Wenchang and 
Qiongshan 
counties and Sanya city. 
  The contractual funds for the agricultural projects have 
come 
to 85.18 million U.S. dollars, accounting for 9 percent of the 
total funds invested in Hainan Province. 
  In Sanya city in the southern part of the Hainan island, 
there are 47 enterprises funded by Taiwanese businessmen. 
Eighteen of them are agricultural ones with a total investment 
of 4.33 million U.S. dollars, 30.45 million H.K. [Hong Kong] 
dollars and 15.54 million yuan, accounting for 47.6 percent of 
the total investment by Taiwanese businessmen in the city. 
  Agricultural development has become one of the major targets 
investment by Taiwanese businessmen. 
  Hong Zhaoming, one of the earliest Taiwanese businessmen to 
invest in Sanya city, now has contracted for 150 hectares of 
farmland. He will introduce high-quality bananas, mangoes and 
seedless watermelon from Taiwan. 
  Hong is now planning to expand his agricultural development 
projects to Dongfang, Ledong and Changjiang counties. By the 
end of 1995, Hong's corporation will have developed 330 hectares 
of farmland to grow tropical fruits and flowers. 
  Hainan is an agricultural province. Of its 6.8 million 
population, 80 percent are now living in rural areas. 
  Wang Yongchun, mayor of Sanya city, said that the 
agricultural projects financed by Taiwan investors serve as an 
eye-opener local farmers.

  [Text] The Gansu Provincial Economic and Trade Commission, 
the Gansu Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China, and 
the Gansu Provincial Branch of the Industrial and Commercial 
Bank of China jointly issued a circular yesterday, calling on 
financial and banking departments at all levels in Gansu to 
provide loans to state-owned industrial enterprises so as to 
guarantee them sufficient circulating funds. 
  The circular also laid out specific measures for providing 
loss-making state-owned industrial enterprises with bank loans, 
stipulating: State-owned industrial enterprises which are 
capable of producing readily marketable products and generating 
good economic results but lack circulating funds, shall apply to 
specialized banks for loans so as to acquire sufficient 
circulating funds. The local economic and trade commissions at 
all levels across the province shall take the initiative to 
assist the relevant specialized banks to investigate and verify 
the operational needs of state-owned industrial enterprises. 
Furthermore, the specialized banks shall actively assist 
state-owned industrial enterprises in this connection, 
particularly those enterprises that are capable of producing 
marketable products and generating better economic results, 
thereby enabling loss-making state-owned industrial enterprises 
to resume normal operations at an earlier date. Nevertheless, 
the circular stated, different situations should be handled in 
different fashions. For example, specialized banks shall 
provide proper assistance to state-owned industrial enterprises 
capable of reducing losses or turning losses into profits before 
the end of this year, thereby helping them tide over the current 
difficulties as quickly as possible. 
  The circular noted: Under the leadership of the local party 
committees and people's governments, economic and trade 
commissions at all levels across the province shall cooperate 
with the specialized banks and departments in charge of 
enterprises in amalgamating and combining long-standing 
loss-making state-owned industrial enterprises that are 
incapable of repaying bank loans or cutting losses in order to 
enable these enterprises to either transform their production 
lines, develop readily marketable products, or engage in 
tertiary industrial development. Those state-owned industrial 
enterprises that are unable to improve operations after being 
amalgamated or combined should be declared bankrupt without 
delay in accordance with the law. In so doing, the circular 
stated, appropriate measures should be adopted to guarantee the 
basic livelihood of the staff and workers.

  [Text] A provincial coal work meeting which ended on 21 
June pointed out: Our province's specific guidelines for 
developing its coal industry are that we must base ourselves on 
the real situation in our province, implement unified planning, 
stabilize the Datong Coal Mine, and devote our primary efforts 
to develop the (Rehe) coal mining area. We must select the best 
coal mines and transform them [words indistinct]. We must pay 
attention to the production of anthracite and coke and support 
the development of coal mines run by townships and towns. We 
must strive to boost the province's annual coal production 
output to 4.5 million tons by 2000. 
  The above-mentioned meeting convened by the provincial 
government made a conscientious analysis of the present 
situation of the coal industry in our province and the present 
difficulties facing the coal enterprises. It worked out 
preferential policies for supporting the development of the coal 
industry in our province and made overall arrangements 
beneficial to that development. Coal has occupied an important 
position in our province's fuel production setup. At present, 
coal has accounted for 58 percent of our province's energy 
consumption; however, our province's self-supporting rate of 
coal last year was only 52 percent. We need to import 1,700,000 
tons of coal every year. Developing the coal industry and 
increasing its self-support rate is our province's long-term 
goal of struggle. 
  Vice Provincial Governor Wang Hanmin spoke at the meeting on 
the future development of our province's coal industry. He 
said: Our province's coal industry has been developing under 
difficult conditions, but it has nonetheless made marked 
contributions to economic development throughout the province. 
In recent years, though coal enterprises have encountered 
enormous difficulties and their output has dropped, we must 
understand that demand in the coal market is currently in a 
state of change. A favorable opportunity has come our way. 
  Wang Hanmin stressed: We must seize this favorable 
opportunity and have sense of urgency for reform and 
development. We must focus on running existing coal enterprises 
well, increasing investment, and speeding up the pace of 
updating facilities and technical transformation. We must 
transform or expand several of the existing enterprises' 
production projects, increase their production staying power, 
and boost their production output. Coal enterprises are also 
facing the problem of transforming their operational mechanisms. 
They must free themselves from the long-term traditional planned 
economic pattern, must transform their internal management 
systems to meet the needs of the market economy, and must 
promote the development of the coal industry in our province.

  [Text] Since August 1993, the industrial and commercial 
administration organs at all levels across the province have 
actively plunged into the joint operation of antismuggling along 
the 1,400 km long border. As of now, these administrative 
organs have dispatched 1,272 personnel to the struggle against 
smuggling and trafficking in smuggled goods. They have cracked 
down on the 6,923 cases involving illegal import of cars. They 
have confiscated more than 67 million yuan in goods and 
collection of fines. 
  The industrial and commercial bureaus of various cities and 
autonomous prefectures across the province have made unified 
arrangements for the specific struggle against smuggling and 
trafficking in smuggled goods. They have also continuously 
carried out the activities of dealing blows at smuggling and 
trafficking in smuggled goods by concentrating their time and 
giving priority to handling key cases. The industrial and 
commercial administration organs of border cities and counties, 
which have coordinated with the armed police forces and public 
security organs of border areas, have enhanced the supervision 
and inspection over vital communications lines and passes by 
assigning personnel to be on duty day and night. They have 
conducted strict inspection over vehicles passing by, as well as 
investigated and handled promptly the smuggling of vehicles and 
goods as soon as they have been discovered.

  [Text] Liu Zegang, the arch criminal belonging to a big 
gang of criminals who abducted women and forced them to engage 
in prostitution, which caused a sensation in the mountain city 
of Benxi, was shot dead on the spot by public security police 
when he resisted arrest with a gun and put up a desperate 
struggle. 
  In March 1994, Benxi city public security bureau cracked a 
case involving a big gang of criminals who abducted women and 
forced them to engage in prostitution. This gang involved 31 
criminals. Under the pretext of helping them find a job in 
Guangzhou or arranging a tour for them, they fooled 39 school 
girls and unemployed young women and took them to Shenzhen and 
forced them to engage in prostitution in an effort to seek 
exorbitant profits. In addition, they also used despicable and 
cruel means to inflict mental and physical suffering on them. 
So far, public security organs have captured 16 criminals and 
saved 10 young women. Criminal Liu Zegang was the chieftain of 
the criminal gang. In September 1990, he was sentenced to three 
and a half years imprisonment for theft. After his release, he 
was unemployed. Shortly after 1500 on the afternoon of 26 May, 
after being pursued and captured by the police with no way out, 
criminal Liu ignoring the police's repeated oral warnings and 
warning shots, stubbornly resisted arrest with a gun and was 
wounded by our public security police's decisive firing of guns 
and subsequently died. 
  Recently, Benxi city public security bureau held a 
commendatory meeting to award a citation of merit, third class, 
to Inspectors Wang Ge and Wang Baoren who pursued and shot 
criminal Liu.

  [Text] Shenyang, June 24 (XINHUA) -- North-east China's 
Liaoning Province, one of the most industrialized areas of 
China, is trying to restructure its economy, aiming to pull 
ahead of others again in the economic field. 
  Wen Shizhen, acting governor of the province, said that 
Liaoning is mapping out a blueprint to revitalize its 
state-owned economic sector and bring another economic boom to 
the former industrial leader of China. 
  Liaoning, with a population topping 40 million, has more 
than 
1,260 state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, accounting 
for one-tenth of the nation's total. These enterprises have 
given great help to the country during past decades. 
  But due to long-term running under a tightly planned 
economy, 
most of them have problems adjusting themselves to the demands 
of the market economy which China is implementing. Still worse, 
an economic boom is hindered by outdated equipment and means of 
production. 
  The acting governor said that the province is making 
vigorous 
efforts to restructure its economy. The state-owned sector is 
being revived and new economic sectors, including private firms, 
rural enterprises and foreign-funded enterprises, have been 
developing rapidly. 
  By 1995, the majority of state-owned enterprises are 
expected 
to make a profit as new management systems and relevant reforms 
are being carried out in them. 
  The industrial output value of the non-state-owned economic 
sector makes up 47.5 percent of the province's total, compared 
with only 16.4 percent in 1978. The rural enterprises have 
generated one-third of the province's gross product, reaching 
164.3 billion yuan last year. 
  According to the acting governor, a market system for 
commodities, finance, technology and labor will be established 
in the province soon, to guide enterprises' production according 
to market demand. The present planning system will be phased 
out. 
  Social security insurance and the housing system will also 
be 
reformed to cope with the new situation. 
  The province will open further to the outside world. The 
port city of Dalian will be built into a center of finance, 
trade and information services. 
  Foreign businessmen are encouraged to invest in basic 
industries, infrastructure facilities and high-tech sectors. 
Export-oriented ventures are also welcomed. 
  Liaoning has huge economic development potential as it has 
vast reserves in oil, iron, coal, non-ferrous metals and 
diamonds. It is self-sufficient in food supplies. 
  In addition, the number of high-grade personnel in science 
and technology and in management is large. Geographic 
advantages, including a long coastline and numerous ports, will 
also help the province's development, said the acting governor.

  [Text] On 18 June, the municipal discipline inspection 
commission held a meeting of district, county, bureau (general 
company), university and college discipline inspection 
commission secretaries and supervisory bureau (section) 
directors to relay and implement the guidelines of the national 
telephone conference of discipline inspection and supervisory 
departments cosponsored by the Central Discipline Inspection 
Commission and the Ministry of Supervision. The meeting 
stressed the necessity to expand the dynamics of punishment and 
to concentrate energy on investigating and handling a number of 
major and appalling cases. 
  Since the second plenary session of the Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission held last year, Beijing Municipality has 
expanded the dynamics of investigating and handling major and 
appalling cases, forcefully attacked unlawful and undisciplined 
activities, and made appropriate achievements. Thus, the people 
have strengthened the confidence in opposing corruption. In 
1993, the discipline inspection and supervisory organs across 
the municipality investigated and handled 1,044 undisciplined 
cases of various categories and handled 593 party members. Of 
this, 518 or 49.6 percent were cases involving violation of 
economic discipline. Of the cases investigated and handled, 183 
or 17.5 percent were major and appalling cases. In the first 
five months of this year, the discipline inspection and 
supervisory organs across the municipality investigated and 
handled 659 undisciplined cases of various categories, an 
increase of 48.1 percent over the same period of last year when 
445 cases were investigated and handled. Of this, 61 were major 
and appalling cases. 
  Li Yongan, standing committee member of the municipal party 
committee and secretary of the municipal discipline inspection 
commission, made a speech at the meeting. He said: The 
discipline inspection and supervisory organs at various levels 
across the municipality should conscientiously implement the 
guidelines of the national telephone conference of discipline 
inspection and supervisory departments held on 9 June, as well 
as the guidelines of the "circular on paying attention to 
investigating and handling major and appalling economic cases in 
the course of waging the struggle against corruption as issued 
by the offices of the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council," and should expand the dynamics of investigating and 
handling major and appalling cases. In the next few months, the 
discipline inspection and supervisory organs across the 
municipality should concentrate time and energy on investigating 
and concluding a number of major and appalling cases; pay 
particular attention to conscientiously investigating and 
handling a number of major and appalling cases of engaging in 
corruption, giving and accepting bribes, getting money by fraud, 
indulging in smuggling, and seriously violating financial and 
economic discipline; and make noticeable achievements. We 
should continuously focus our efforts on investigating party and 
government leading organs, judicial departments, administrative 
and law enforcement departments, and economic management 
departments; and emphatically investigate and handle the major 
economic criminal cases relating to the leading cadres at or 
above the county (section) level. We should openly handle and 
expose the cases with influential power in order to build up 
momentum and produce an impact. He stressed: The leaders at 
various levels, particularly party and government top leaders, 
should further upgrade understanding, pay high attention to 
investigating and handling major and appalling cases, and 
support discipline inspection and supervisory departments to 
strictly and rapidly investigate and handle a number of cases of 
violating economic laws and economic discipline. We should 
ensure the supply of funds for handling cases for the discipline 
inspection and supervisory departments and provide necessary 
material conditions for investigating and handling major and 
appalling cases. Leaders of the discipline inspection and 
supervisory organs at various levels should personally go to the 
forefront to handle cases. It is necessary to strictly carry 
out the system of responsibility for handling cases among each 
level. We should further strengthen the coordination and 
cooperation of law and discipline enforcement departments and 
the departments for supervision over the enforcement of 
administrative laws, and have them closely cooperate with one 
another, and form cohesive power. Discipline inspection and 
supervisory departments should resolutely withstand the 
obstacles created by the practice of interceding for somebody. 
We should grasp the typical cases of refusing to report and 
handle cases, creating obstacles for handling cases, offering 
false evidence, and refusing to offer evidence; and openly and 
strictly investigate and affix the responsibility for these 
cases.

  [Text] An official Chinese denial of a report on the 
paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, has created a rift with a 
Beijing-controlled newspaper in Hong Kong. 
  China's Foreign Ministry yesterday denied a report in WEN 
WEI 
PO that the patriarch recently visited the Shandong province 
seaside resort of Qingdao. 
  "This report is not accurate," a spokesman, Wu Jianmin, told 
a regular news conference in Beijing. Switching from Chinese to 
English for emphasis, he added: "It is not true." 
  Sources in Qingdao added they were sure Deng had not been 
there. 
  "We would have known the day he arrived and been immediately 
instructed by city officials whether we could reveal it or not," 
a journalist in Qingdao said. Another source in the city added 
that no senior official from Beijing had stayed recently at the 
Eight Great Passes Scenic Area Resort, the official residence 
for senior leaders visiting the city. 
  The report may have been an attempt to contradict growing 
rumours of Deng's deteriorating health, which have been fuelled 
by television pictures of an emaciated and stunned-looking 
figure shuffling along the streets of Shanghai supported by his 
two daughters during the lunar new year holiday. 
  The Chinese leader's health has been of particular concern 
in 
Hong Kong, where "the Deng factor" has a strong effect on 
markets, business and politics. 
  The report quoted Deng, 89, as saying China's economic 
reforms and its policy of opening to the outside world would not 
change "unless there is an unavoidable large-scale war". It was 
reported that Deng also ruled out a multi-party political system. 
  WEN WEI PO's editor-in-chief, Liu Zaiming, said yesterday 
the 
paper stood by its report. 
  "I know about the Foreign Ministry statement. But what we 
have reported is what we believe," he said. 
  The newspaper is controlled by China's Communist Party 
through the Hong Kong branch of the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY 
(XINHUA). 
  It would not be the first time it has printed an erroneous 
story about the patriarch. 
  Last December, it reported Deng had gone to vote in Beijing 
municipal elections when it was widely known that he was in 
Shanghai.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] Patriarch Deng Xiaoping has asked China's top 
generals to safeguard an orderly succession and to defuse unrest 
that might occur after his death. 
  Chinese sources said while Mr Deng's health remained 
precarious, he was fit enough to do short-term travelling. 
  Leaving weighty matters of state to lieutenants including 
President Jiang Zemin and Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, the patriarch 
has devoted his energy to ensuring a smooth succession. 
  Informed sources said in a secret talk to about 20 senior 
generals earlier this year, Mr Deng spelled out a two-pronged 
strategy for guaranteeing a trouble-free succession. 
  "Rally round comrade Jiang Zemin as the core of the new 
leadership," Mr Deng told the gathering of top brass, who 
included former president Yang Shangkun, one of Mr Jiang's major 
rivals. 
  "Uphold political stability at all costs. Provide help to 
the party and the Government in maintaining social order. 
Bolster central authority and check the growth of regionalism." 
  The patriarch specifically asked his long-time 
comrade-in-arms General Liu Huaqing to help Mr Jiang, Mr Deng's 
successor as Central Military Commission (CMC) chairman, 
consolidate his hold over the People's Liberation Army and the 
paramilitary People's Armed Police. 
  Under Mr Deng's overall guidance, Mr Jiang, General Liu and 
the generals laid down contingency plans through which urban 
riots could be contained and defused. 
  Military sources said after having secured the loyalty of 
the 
generals, including the commanders and commissars of the eight 
military regions, Mr Deng and Vice-chairman of the CMC, General 
Liu, are confident that the centrifugal tendencies of a number 
of powerful regional cadres could be held in check. 
  In return, the army officers have been assured a big budget 
and a large say in civilian matters, particularly foreign policy. 
  The Chinese-run Hong Kong daily, WEN WEI PO, reported 
yesterday that Mr Deng recently toured Qingdao in eastern 
Shandong province. 
  It quoted authoritative sources in Beijing as saying Mr Deng 
was accompanied by General Liu and that he had given 
instructions on maintaining stability. 
  The report was yesterday denied by the Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin. 
  Asked to clarify Mr Deng's whereabouts, Mr Wu said: "Mr Deng 
Xiaoping is wherever he is." 
  Sources in Beijing said however, that Mr Deng had indeed 
travelled out of Beijing, and that he had spent time with 
General Liu on ways to promote stability. 
  The sources said the senior leader paid a week-long visit to 
Shanghai in late April. 
  The patriarch's recent edicts are similar to those reported 
in WEN WEI PO yesterday. 
  "To ensure the longevity of Communist-Party rule, we must 
absolutely not change the policy of taking economic construction 
as the national core," Mr Deng reportedly said. 
  "Taking the lesson from the former Soviet Union, we must 
handle well the relationship between the centre and the regions. 
  "We must uphold Communist Party leadership The ruling status 
of the Communist Party must no be compromised. China cannot 
have a multi-party system." 
  What WEN WEI PO has not reported is that Mr Deng has given 
instructions to the PLA, his major power base to "provide 
imperial escort" to his policy.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Hong Kong Newspaper Carries False </F>
Report on Deng Xiaoping; Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman 
Makes Clarification"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 23 Jun (TA KUNG PAO) -- Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said that the front-page news in 
today's Hong Kong WEN WEI PO about Deng Xiaoping's recent visit 
to Shandong in the company of Central Military Commission Vice 
Chairman Liu Huaqing was not true. There was no such a thing. 
  At today's foreign ministry press briefing a Taiwan 
reporter, 
who was the first to raise a question, asked Wu Jianmin to 
confirm the aforementioned news. Instead of evading, Wu Jianmin 
replied straightforwardly: "This question should not have been 
answered by the Foreign Ministry but, since you have raised it, 
I would like to tell you that the news is untrue, it is not 
correct. There is no such a thing." 
  Following that, a Hong Kong reporter made a further inquiry: 
"Where, then, is Deng now?" Wu Jianmin replied with laughter: 
"Mr. Deng is wherever he is." 
  When it was time for the last question, a REUTER reporter 
asked: If the news is incorrect, why did WEN WEI PO front-page 
it? 
  Wu Jianmin replied: I am the spokesman for the foreign 
ministry and not for WEN WEI PO. You had better ask WEN WEI PO 
that question.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Beijing Denies WEN WEI PO Report on </F>
Deng Xiaoping's Visit to Qingdao"] 
  [Text] A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman openly denied 
the news about Deng Xiaoping's recent visit to Qingdao, 
Shandong, carried in Hong Kong's pro-China WEN WEI PO yesterday. 
Regarding the news, spokesman Wu Jianmin said at the press 
briefing yesterday: "The news is not true. There is no such a 
thing." 
  To prove the inaccuracy of the report, Wu stressed in 
English: "It is not true." 
  When a reporter further inquired about the whereabouts of 
Deng Xiaoping and asked whether Deng was recuperating somewhere 
around Qingdao, Wu Jianmin did not answer the question directly. 
He simply said: "Mr. Deng Xiaoping is wherever he is." 
  Yesterday, WEN WEI PO front-paged a report which said: 
"During a recent tour of Qingdao, Deng Xiaoping discussed three 
major issues concerning China's development: First, the 
principle of taking economic development as the center must 
never change; second, it is necessary to sum up the lesson of 
the former Soviet Union and properly handle the relationship 
between the center and the localities; and third, uphold party 
leadership and do not practice a multiparty system." 
  However, a Qingdao government official yesterday denied the 
report about Deng Xiaoping's recent inspection tour of the city. 
In response to an inquiry from a MING PAO reporter, the 
official said there was no such thing. 
  In a telephone inquiry FROM MING PAO reporter Zhang Qingyun, 
the first deputy editor-in-chief of WEN WEI PO, refused to make 
any comment on the paper's response to the matter.

  [Text] Beijing, June 24 (XINHUA) -- Senior Chinese leader 
Wu Xueqian said here today that the five principles of peaceful 
coexistence, which were promulgated 40 years ago by China, India 
and Myanmar (Burma), marked a milestone in the history of modern 
international relations. 
  Wu, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), told a CPPCC 
forum marking the 40th anniversary of the five principles that 
they "embody the ideas of sovereignty, equality, mutual benefit 
and peace in the new era of international relations." 
  The five principles of peaceful coexistence, namely mutual 
respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, 
non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal 
affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, 
were first formulated by China and later advocated by China and 
its neighboring countries of India and Myanmar in 1954. 
  Wu noted that in the diversified world the five principles, 
antagonistic to hegemonism and power politics, have received the 
sincere support of most countries. 
  He pointed out that China is not only an advocate but also a 
faithful follower of the principles. "China has never occupied 
even an inch of any other country's territory, nor has it 
interfered in any other country's internal affairs," he added. 
  Wu stressed that China will constitute no threat to any 
state 
or region, even after it becomes stronger economically. 
  He went on to say that the international situation remains 
disorderly, and hegemonism and power politics still exist even 
after the Cold War. As early as in 1974, Wu continued, Deng 
Xiaoping proposed at a special UN conference that the political 
and economic relations between countries should be set up on the 
basis of the five principles. 
  In 1988, Wu said, Deng further proposed that a new type of 
political and economic world order should be established in 
accordance with the five principles. "These ideas are becoming 
the common understanding of more and more countries," he added. 
  Among those attending the forum were Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme 
and 
Zhao Puchu, both vice-chairmen of the CPPCC National Committee.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] Beijing has been more forthcoming in providing 
information about prisoners of conscience, according to veteran 
human rights lobbyist John Kamm. 
  And a senior source in the human rights movement has 
indicated China may release famous dissident Ren Wanding in the 
near future. 
  In meetings officials in the Justice Ministry earlier this 
week, Mr Kamm was given information concerning the whereabouts 
of 10 little-known detainees. 
  "The judicial authorities were willing to give a systematic 
account of a number of prisoners of conscience I raised with 
them, including age, sex, occupation, health conditions and 
their attitude in prison," Mr Kamm said in Hong Kong yesterday. 
"This is an encouraging development." 
  For example, the lobbyist was told that Zhai Decheng, 
sentenced in 1983 to 15 years, escaped after 10 months in jail. 
Zhai (sometimes known as Cai), a worker who was detained for 
putting up "counter-revolutionary posters", escaped from Kaifeng 
Prison in Henan province in October 1984 and has not been 
recaptured. 
  Qi Dafeng, a former graduate student who is serving two 
Years 
in a re education through labour camps for meeting America-based 
student dissident Shen Tong in late 1992, has had his sentence 
extended by three months. Qi, originally due for release this 
year, was criticised by judicial officials for "refusing to 
submit to discipline," Mr Kamm said. 
  Details of the conditions of Yu Dongyue, Kajikhumar Shabdan 
and Jampel Changchup were also given. 
  Yu, 29, is serving a life sentence in Hunan No. 1 prison for 
spilling ink on Chairman Mao's portrait in Tiananmen Square. 
  Shabdan, 71, a Kazakh was detained in 1987 for alleged 
espionage. He was given a 15-year term to be served in Urumqi 
No. 1 Prison. 
  And Tibetan Changchup, 33, is serving a 19-year term in the 
Lhasa Prison, also for espionage. 
  Mr Kamm said he was told the number of jailed 
"counter-revolutionaries" in China was 2,935 at the end of 
March, compared with 3,036 at the end of 1993. 
  He said Chinese officials were aware that while President 
Bill Clinton had delinked human rights from trade, "that's not 
the same as saying that the human rights issue has been 
resolved". 
  Meanwhile, a source in the human rights crusade said 
yesterday he was given hints by officials that dissident 
intellectual Ren, sentenced to seven years in prison in 1991, 
might be paroled later this year. 
  "I was told that Ren's behaviour in jail is good and that he 
has followed the rules and regulations," he said. The source 
said, however, he was less optimistic about former senior 
official Bao Tong, the principal secretary of ousted party chief 
Zhao Ziyang. 
  Western government have been pressing Beijing to grant 
"medical bail" to Bao, who is serving a seven year term. 
  "The authorities do not dispute that Bao is ill," the source 
added. "But they claim they do not think he can receive better 
medical treatment out side prison.

<F P=106> [By Gao Jinan: "Dope Seizures and Addict Arrests up"] </F>
  [Text] China is to intensify its war against drug abuse 
and illicit trafficking, hoping to reduce drug-related climes to 
the lowest possible level a top anti-drugs official said 
yesterday in Beijing. 
  Close cooperation among police and customs in all provinces 
and with the international community will be needed to fight the 
drug war, the official warned. 
  Zhuo Feng, deputy secretary general of the National 
Narcotics 
Control Commission, made these remarks just before the 
International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking 
which falls on Sunday. 
  All provinces and cities will stage public awareness 
activities to alert people about the dangers of drugs. 
  In the first quarter of this year, more than 4,910 
narcotics-related cases were solved and 6,624 suspects were 
detained. This marked a 64.6 percent and 40 percent increase 
over the same period last year. 
  Seizures included 1.007 kilograms of heroin and 476 
kilograms 
of opium, Zhuo said. 
  Last year, a total of 26,191 drug cases were cracked and 
40,834 suspects were detained. 
  During that year police and customs seized 4,459 kilograms 
of 
heroin, 3,354 kilograms of opium and 90 tons of chemicals which 
could be made into narcotics. 
  Among the detained, 6,137 were sentenced. Some 1,410 
received death sentence or terms of life imprisonment. 
  China's anti-drug campaign has focused on the Guangxi Zhuang 
Autonomous Region and Yunnan Province, both bordering the 
notorious "Golden Triangle" in Myanmar [Burma], Thailand and 
Laos. 
  The border provinces accounted for about 80 per cent of the 
heroin and 70 percent of the opium seized in the country in the 
first three months this year, Zhuo said. 
  Estimates of the number of drug addicts in the country stand 
at 250,000. Over 400 drug rehabilitation centres have been 
established to help the addicts quit their criminal vice. 
  Last year, about 50,000 gave up their addiction after 
treatment in the centres, he said. 
  He also revealed that 982 HIV positive cases among the 1,106 
found in the mainland were caused by drugs addiction and 
injection. 
  HIV is a major virus which can lead to AIDS. 
  Zhuo said that his commission and the Ministry of Public 
Security have drafted a set of rules to force drug addicts to 
quit. The rules have been submitted to the State Council and 
are expected to be approved and implemented later this year. 
  The country has been actively cooperating with international 
organizations on narcotics control. Personnel training and 
information exchanges on drug trafficking cases have been 
carried out with some countries. 
  The narcotics control programme of China, Myanmar and the UN 
is being carried out smoothly and China's cooperation with 
Thailand and Laos in this field has also been strengthened.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 24 (XINHUA) -- Traditionally Chinese 
people who were wronged used to seek help from the government. 
  Nowadays more and more people go straight to lawyers and 
courts to ask for justice and protection. 
  Not long ago an ordinary woman worker from Fotang town in 
Yiwu city, Zhejiang Province, succeeded in winning a lawsuit 
against a local official who had raped her. 
  "The reason why I went directly to the court and not to the 
government office was that I believed that the law had absolute 
power and I was afraid that the government might shelter the 
official," said the young lady, who preferred to remain 
anonymous. 
  Influenced by the 2,000-year old feudal tradition, the idea 
of "power overriding the law" used to be deep-rooted among the 
Chinese. 
  But since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 
1949, the Chinese Government has formulated a package of laws 
and regulations, including the "Constitution of the People's 
Republic of China," and laws concerning administrative 
procedure, compulsory education, marriage, environmental 
protection, food hygiene and protection of the legal rights of 
disabled people. 
  Provincial governments have worked out a series of 
regulations and rules in line with local conditions. 
  Deng Xiaoping once said, "We must inculcate the idea of law 
into the minds of the people and enable more and more people to 
avoid violating the law but instead positively uphold the law." 
  In answering the call, the central government and the 
National People's Congress have launched a publicity drive on 
the legal system among the broad masses of the people. 
  Armed with a general knowledge of the law, people dare to 
bring suits against anyone who wrongs them. 
  Liu Daiguo, a blacksmith of Longguan village in Neijiang 
city, Sichuan Province, was suspected by the local police of 
disposing of stolen goods. All his iron and steel, which he had 
purchased through legal channels and his business license were 
confiscated. Liu appealed to the local court, which ordered the 
police to compensate Liu for his loss. 
  Failing to persuade her husband to confess his crime of 
bribery to a local procuratorate, a woman living on the 
outskirts of Shanghai reported him to the procuratorate herself. 
  A survey of the coastal areas shows that local 
procuratorates 
have received 92,317 letters and telephone calls of complaints 
over the past six years. 
  China has formed a network of judicial organs, and lawyers 
are respected and regarded as important by the people, who rely 
on them to protect their legal rights. 
  At present, more than 1,000 families, most of whom include 
public figures or private businesses, in Shanghai have employed 
lawyers. 
  In addition, notarization has been introduced into the daily 
life of the family. 
  Many families have their rights of inheritance, property and 
real estate notarized. 
  In Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province, there are 14 
notaries public.

  [Text] Beijing, June 24 (XINHUA) -- China's first banking 
law, the Draft Law on the People's Bank of China, is to be 
submitted to the National People's Congress, the country's top 
legislature, for deliberation starting on June 28, after 15 
years of formulation and repeated revisions, a NPC spokesman 
said here today. 
  The draft law is to specify the position and 
responsibilities 
of the People's Bank as the central bank, and uphold the 
authority of monetary policies, Zhou Chenggui told a press 
conference on the upcoming Eighth Session of the Eighth NPC 
Standing Committee. 
  The new law will also be "necessary for supervision and 
control over China's financial industry, and the establishment 
of the macro adjustment system with the central bank as the 
core," he said. 
  In the eight-day meeting ending July 5, the draft 
arbitration 
law and the draft auditing law will also be submitted to the 
legislators for review. 
  The formulation of the arbitration law aims at improving 
China's arbitration system, better solving economic disputes and 
maintaining social economic order, Zhou claimed. 
  "It will help to develop China's socialist market economy, 
and promote international economic and trade exchanges and 
cooperation," he said. 
  The legislature will continue its review of the draft 
securities law, which has already been deliberated in two 
sessions. 
  Zhou disclosed that there are some "major changes" to the 
previous version of the draft law this time, based on the 
reviews by the lawmakers and opinions of people from all walks 
of life. 
  He said the NPC Standing Committee session will also 
deliberate the Draft Labor Law, the Draft Urban Real Estate Law 
and the Draft Regulation on Punishing Copyright Violators. 
These were submitted to the legislature in the previous two 
sessions. 
  Also included on the agenda are the examination of the 1993 
final state accounts, a review of the State Council reports on 
China's forestry industry and NPC special committees' reports on 
the implementation of the statistics law and the teachers law.

  [Text] Beijing, June 24 (CNS) -- The trunk railway lines, 
including those between Zhejiang and Jiangxi as well as between 
Guangxi and Guizhou, were badly stricken and a great loss was 
caused because of the torrential rain which hit the southern 
area of the Yangtze River and South China since mid-June and led 
to torrents of water rushing down the mountains and floods. 
  There were 14 main railway lines affected by floods as of 
June 19, according to the Ministry of Railways. A breakdown of 
railway service happened on 42 occasions, which resulted in a 
loss of rail service time of up to 371 hours, a rise of 237 
hours over the same period last year. Loading and unloading 
services were affected, involving some 2,000 cars in the railway 
system on average each day. Incomplete statistics showed that 
direct economic damage to the railway lines resulting from the 
floods was put at over RMB 70 million [renminbi], while indirect 
economic loss because of breakdown of rail service was much more 
serious. 
  As the flood season came earlier than normal with a violent 
impact, railway lines in central Fujian Province were affected 
by landslides because of torrents or water rushing down the 
mountain between May 1 and 3. A 27-kilometre section of the 
Yingtan-Xiamen railway line was buried by a mud-rock flow, which 
led to a breakdown of rail service of up to 68 hours. Railway 
service between Zhejiang and Jiangxi and that between Guangxi 
and Guizhou came to a halt mainly due to the floods. 
  Guangdong and Hunan were violently hit by rainstorms. 
Railway service was seriously affected, including the railway 
lines between Beijing and Guangzhou, between Hunan and Guizhou, 
as well as between Hunan and Guangxi, all of which are under the 
jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Railway Administration. Along 
these lines, landslides and sections submerged in water took 
place in 60 places, and the water level at seven bridges was 
well over the warning line. 
  The southern part of China is still subject to heavy rain in 
recent days, according to weather forecasts. A flood control 
command was set up by the ministry and various railway 
administrations, and a 600,000-strong emergency team was also 
established to stand by in a bid to fight possible floods and 
ensure the safety of railway service.

  [Text] Hangzhou, June 24 (XINHUA) -- An ODS [ozone 
depleting substances] substitutes research center has been set 
up here to help protect the ozone layer and the global 
environment. 
  The main task of the center is to improve the research and 
development of substitutes for ozone depleting substances (ODS), 
by developing new products and technology. 
  The research center was set up on the basis of the chemical 
industry research center in Zhejiang Province under the Ministry 
of Chemical Industry. 
  Zhejiang is an important production base of fluorine raw 
material ore in China. The amount of reserves, production and 
exports account for one-third of the total in the whole country. 
  The Zhejiang Chemical Industry Institute has successfully 
worked out dozens of substitutes for freon that do little harm 
to the ozone layer. Some are under test use and are supplied to 
major refrigerator enterprises. 
  The substitute for another ozone depletion substance -- 
halon, a fire extinguishing agent -- is under development. 
  ODS are mainly used in industrial cooling and electronic 
cleansing devices. When the substances are released into the 
atmosphere they are likely to destroy the ozone layer, which 
absorbs ultra-violet light and reduces the sun's radiation. 
  China is the biggest ODS producer and consumer among the 
developing countries. It joined the Vienna pact for the 
protection of the ozone layer in 1989. 
  In 1992 China drew up its first national program for 
progressively eliminating ozone depleting substances.

  [Text] Beijing, June 23 (XINHUA) -- China is striving to 
capture a foothold in the high-tech domain of high-definition 
(HD) TV sets. 
  Ye Peida, head of the country's HD TV research team, said, 
"otherwise, China will lose a tremendous TV market and a golden 
opportunity to bolster its overall national strength with new 
technology." 
  Ye is an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences 
(CAS). 
  Chinese and foreign experts have predicted that a global 
market worth several billion U.S. dollars for HD TV sets and 
related products will take shape by the end of this century. 
  They expect a Chinese market of some 800,000 sets valued at 
2.4 billion U.S. dollars a year by that time. 
  Ye said that China has mapped out its strategic development 
goal for HD TVs, which stipulates that by around the year 2000 
it will have set up an experimental telecasting station able to 
make some programs. By then China will also have grasped the 
technology necessary for HD TV systems and be able to develop 
and produce, although in small numbers, HD TV receivers. 
  To achieve that goal, Ye said, China has drawn up detailed 
plans for two development stages: From now to 1996 China will 
pool efforts to tackle key technical problems and set up an 
experimental system for HD TV models. The following five years 
will see China go all out to develop HD TVs in an all-round way. 
  He said that China is in a favorable position to develop HD 
TVs, as a digital telecommunications network characterized by 
optic cables, satellites and microwaves has been formed 
nationwide. 
  According to him, the ministry of the electronics industry 
has established an HD TV research center, which conducts 
research on HD TV model receivers and satellite digital-data 
receiving systems in co-operation with the country's 
eight-largest TV enterprises, including the Changhong, Peony and 
Panda TV plants. 
  The study of HD TVs has undergone great changes since Japan 
developed the world's first HD TV system in the 1970s. In 1991 
the United States surprised the world with an all-digital HD TV 
system. 
  Experts predict that hd tvs will become widespread by the 
year 2005. 
  He Zuoxiu, a leading CAS physicist, said that the 
development 
of picture tubes and the manufacturing of macro-integrated 
circuits are the biggest difficulties in developing HD TV 
systems. 
  "Once the technical problems are solved, HD TVs will have an 
immeasurable impact on a wide range of sectors, particularly on 
national defense, telecommunications, scientific research, 
medical science and the electronic printing industry," he noted.

  [Text] Shenyang, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Vice-Premier Zhu 
Rongji stressed here the need to reform the system of 
circulation of means of agricultural production, to stabilize 
their prices and to protect the farmers' enthusiasm for growing 
crops. 
  During a June 14-21 tour of north-east China's Jilin and 
Liaoning Provinces, Vice-Premier Zhu said the reform of the 
system of grain purchases and sales (which is aimed at suitably 
raising the prices of the government-purchased and sold grain) 
is being carried out smoothly in the two province. 
  As a result, the prices of grain are basically stable. The 
farmers are satisfied and become much more enthusiastic to grow 
crops. Meanwhile, the urban residents have expressed their 
understanding of the reform and support it. 
  Vice-Premier Zhu, who is also a member of the Standing 
Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of 
China, noted that grain price control is the core of the party's 
rural policy and an important economic pole for arousing the 
farmers' enthusiasm. 
  Now the farmers' enthusiasm has been aroused, it is 
necessary 
to stabilize or cut the prices of chemical fertilizers and other 
agricultural production means so as to allow the farmers to 
fully benefit from raised prices of government-purchased grain. 
  Vice-Premier Zhu said that only after this could the 
agricultural production be promoted and the farmers' income be 
increased. When the farmers' purchase strength is enhanced, the 
industrial products will have a big market and there will be a 
firm foundation for the development of national economy. 
  How to reform the system of the circulation of farm 
production means and to practically control the prices of 
chemical fertilizers and other agricultural production means is 
the main purpose of Vice-Premier Zhu's inspection tour of the 
two provinces in north-east China. 
  During some informal discussions with local farmers and 
cadres, Vice-Premier Zhu pointed out that in order to 
effectively control the prices of fertilizers and other farm 
production means, it is imperative to increase the production of 
fertilizers and distribute imported chemical fertilizers 
effectively. 
  He said it was also necessary to reform the system of 
circulation of farm production means to reduce the length of the 
circulation chain, streamline the administrative structure, 
improve the management and decrease the circulation costs. 
  Moreover, administration of the market should be 
strengthened, and people who drive up prices to reap staggering 
profits should be dealt with severely, Zhu added.

  [Text] Beijing, June 23 (XINHUA) -- The momentum of price 
rises in China has gradually subsided since March this year and 
the price increase rate has started to fall again, according to 
Zou Xiangqun, deputy secretary-general of the State Planning 
Commission. 
  In an interview with XINHUA, Zou attributed this achievement 
to the various reform measures which the State Council and the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China have taken to 
strengthen macro control of the national economy. 
  Zou said that generally retail sale prices throughout the 
country in May this year were 18.9 percent higher than in the 
same period last year. The figure is 0.6 percentage points 
lower than in April this year. 
  He revealed that the rate of increase of retail sale prices 
in the country's 35 large and medium-sized cities in may this 
year was 1.3 percent lower than in April. 
  Apart from garments, the price increase rate of all 
categories of commodities in May was lower than in April. The 
price increase rate of food in May was down by 0.3 percent 
compared with April's, while that of household appliances 
dropped by 0.5 percentage points and medical products by 0.5, 
transport and telecommunications fares by 0.9, recreation, 
education and cultural commodities by 0.4, housing by 1.7 and 
service fees by 0.8. 
  Zou predicted that the national increase rate of commodities 
will continue to drop in the coming period. 
  Speaking of last year's price increase rate, Zou said that 
it 
reached the highest in December. The influence of this peak 
will further decrease. Besides, he said the macro economic 
situation has been improved. 
  During the five months this year, people's savings deposits 
were 151.8 billion yuan up and the national revenue increased by 
24.3 percent, compared with the same period of last year. The 
investment in fixed assets has been brought under control. At 
the same time, Zou said, the supply of and demand for many 
important commodities have becomed more balanced. 
  Zou stressed that although the price increase rate will 
gradually drop, the prices will remain relatively high for some 
time. Therefore, he said, it is necessary to continue to 
implement all the price-control measures to stabilize the prices 
in order to create a better economic and social environment for 
the reform and development.

  [Text] Beijing, June 23 (XINHUA) -- The newly-established 
Import and Export Bank of China (IEBC) is negotiating with big 
machinery producers to provide export credits for three 
hard-currency-earning items. 
  These are the production of the rocket for launching the 
Hong 
Kong communications satellite "Asia-Pacific Number Two", a 
70,000-ton cargo ship ordered by Norway and a Pakistan-ordered 
training aircraft. 
  Export credits needed for the three projects are estimated 
at 
some 500 million yuan (about 60 million U.S. dollars). 
  According to IEBC President Lie Zuhua, the bank has met 
strong demand from domestic big machinery producers for export 
credits since its founding two months ago. 
  So far it has received formal applications for export 
credits 
for over sixty items, involving a total of 10 billion yuan. 
  "The strong demand shows the huge potential the domestic 
machinery industries hold for export," said Lie. "But it has 
also placed our bank in a bind." 
  Although the bank was set up to boost China's exports of 
machinery products by providing low-interest rate loans to the 
producers, its credit line for the whole of 1994 is limited to 
between 2 billion yuan and 3 billion yuan. 
  The bank has a registered capital of 3.38 billion yuan. But 
the funds will be allocated by the Ministry of Finance in 
several batches during the next couple of years. 
  The fund gap will be filled by bonds issued to domestic 
financial institutions and on the international capital market. 
  Lie said that preparations are in hand for the first issue 
of 
one billion to 1.7 billion yuan worth of bonds this year. 
  The bank is not likely to issue bonds overseas this year, 
Lie 
noted. 
  China exported large machinery worth of 27.7 billion U.S. 
dollars in 1993, a quarter of China's total exports. 
  To cope with the huge demand for export credits, Lie said, 
the central authorities may in the future allow foreign banks to 
provide export credits to Chinese exporters. The lending amount 
will be decided in the light of the government-controlled 
external debt limit. 
  The Import and Export Bank will then provide credit 
guarantees for the domestic exporters. 
  The IEBC president noted that as a policy-oriented bank, the 
new financial house will not be run for profit. 
  In fact, the interest rate on one-year loans by the bank 
only 
stands at 9.54 percent, compared with the 13.98 percent rate for 
the same period loans from commercial banks. 
  To offset the loss, IEBC will gradually expand its business 
in export credit insurance, credit guarantee and other more 
lucrative areas, Lie said.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Bank Set to Help Home Exporters"] </F>
  [Text] The Export and Import Bank of China concluded its 
first hoard meeting in Beijing yesterday with a pledge to 
finance the country's high value-added machinery and electronics 
exports. 
  Tong Zhiguang, chairman of the Board of Directors, said the 
bank will start operations on July 1, and accumulate total 
assets of 5 billion yuan ($570 million) by the end of this 
century. 
  Its registered capital is 3.38 billion yuan ($388 million). 
  Established on April 26 with the approval of the State 
Council (China's cabinet), the bank is one of the three policy 
banks that provide preferential loans to State key industrial 
and trade sectors. 
  The other two are the State Development Bank and the 
Agricultural Bank. 
  The government decided to set up policy banks so that they 
can help State key projects stay afloat by providing more long- 
and medium term loans. 
  Lei Zuhua, governor and vice board chairman of the bank, 
said 
the bank will focus on export credit initially. 
  "At the same time, we will prepare for credit insurance and 
guarantee business," he said. The bank is expected to approve 3 
billion yuan ($345 million) worth of loans to domestic exporters 
this year. The loans actually delivered, how ever, would be 2 
billion yuan ($230 million), he disclosed. 
  Tong said the bank will gradually increase the amount of 
export credit as the country has vast potential in tapping the 
export of technology-intensive machinery and electronic products. 
  In 1993, the export of machinery and electronic products. 
including complete plant systems, accounted for only 24.7 per 
cent of the nation's total export volume. 
  About 60 projects have sought loans worth over 10 billion 
yuan ($1.15 billion) from the bank. But Lei said that three 
projects are likely to receive loans worth a total of 500 
million yuan ($57.5 million). 
  They involve the launch of an overseas satellite and the 
export of a ship to Norway and training aircraft to Pakistan. 
  Lei also said that his bank is expected to issue 1 billion 
yuan ($115 million) to 1.7 billion yuan ($195 million) worth of 
domestic bonds this year. 
  Besides export credit, credit insurance and guarantee, the 
bank can also deal in government loans and mixed loans, which 
are related to the export of China's machinery and electronic 
products. 
  International inter-bank and syndicated loans, the issue of 
financial bonds overseas and project assessment are also part of 
the bank's business scope.

<F P=106> [By Bien Perez] </F>
  [Text] China is expected to unveil a mammoth 60-billion yen 
(HK$4.6 billion [Hong Kong dollars]) Samurai bond early next 
month, which will mark its debut as a sovereign issue in Japan, 
according to securities sources. The Chinese Ministry of 
Finance will be the principal borrower to what will be the 
biggest Chinese-name debt paper issue yet in the cash-rich 
Samurai bond market. 
  Sources said Chinese finance ministry officials were 
currently finalising details of the offering with co-lead 
managers Daiwa, Securities and Nomura Securities. Both 
individual and institutional investors in Japan were being 
targeted by the lead managers, sources said. 
  Samurai bonds are yen-denominated IOUs issued by foreign 
borrowers exclusively to investors in Japan. 
  The proceeds from the Chinese Samurai bonds would probably 
be 
used to support the mainland's ongoing financial-sector reform 
program, sources said. One of the selling strategies being 
studied, according to sources, is to split the Chinese 
government's Samurai bond offering into two; a 30-billion yen 
issue of five-year notes and another 30-billion yen package of 
seven-year notes. In line with that set-up, the Chinese 
government and the lead managers were also considering whether 
to sell the two packages together or separately. 
  One Hong Kong-based securities official, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity, said the borrower would probably benefit 
more if the packages were launched together to take advantage of 
"the current healthy appetite by Japanese investors for 
Chinese-name debt paper. 
  During the past few months, well-heeled Japanese investors 
swiftly snapped up separate Samurai bond offerings made by the 
Bank of China (BOC) and the Tianjin International Trust and 
Investment Corp (Titic). The BOC borrowed 15 billion yen and 
Titic borrowed 13 billion yen. 
  Despite the prevailing negative sentiments in the 
international bond markets, more and more foreign borrowers have 
been drawing fresh funds from the Samurai bond market because of 
Japan's low interest rates. 
  Although the size of the planned Chinese government 
Samurai-bond issue this year was record-breaking, the biggest 
mainland-based borrowers in the Japanese bond market in terms of 
total number of issues were the BOC and the China International 
Trust and Investment Corp (Citic), the overseas investment arm 
of the Chinese government, sources said. 
  The BOC has already made 11 Samurai-bond offerings in recent 
years, the largest of which was a 50-billion yen package in 1986. 
  Citic has made four Samurai-bond issues, the largest of 
which 
was a 40-billion yen issue in 1986.

  [Text] Beijing, June 23 (XINHUA) -- The world's big-name 
auto producers today offered auto fans a feast for the eyes, 
displaying their most up-to-date models at the '94 Beijing 
International Automotive Industry Exhibition, which opened here 
this morning. 
  The week-long exhibition, which has attracted some 900 
well-known car companies and manufacturers as well as 11 
government agencies and trade associations from all over the 
world, is the largest ever staged in China, said sources from 
the organizing committee. 
  Overseas auto enterprises, numbering four times as many as 
at 
the previous event in 1992, include France's Renault, Peugeot 
and Citroen; Japan's Toyota, Mitsubishi and Honda; Germany's 
Volkswagen, Audi and BMW; the United States' General Motors and 
Ford, and dozens of others. 
  Official statistics indicate that China produced 1.34 
million 
automobiles last year, up 20.8 percent from a year earlier. A 
further rise of 15 percent is expected for this year and the 
output for the year 2000 is estimated at three million. 
  K.S. Tong, general manager of Adsale Exhibition Services 
Ltd., one of the organizers of the ongoing exhibition, said that 
auto companies worldwide are quite optimistic about the Chinese 
market, despite a six percent drop in China's auto import volume 
during the first quarter of this year from the same period of 
the previous year. 
  "China will emerge as the world's potentially largest market 
as a result of a sustainable growing Chinese economy," Tong said. 
  The fact that more and more of the world's auto giants have 
been eager to enter the Beijing international auto fair 
indicates that they are interested and confident in the China 
market, he explained. 
  Official data show that 80 percent of the Chinese buyers of 
sedan cars last year were government organizations. Private 
enterprises and foreign-funded joint ventures accounted for 19 
percent, leaving only one percent for individual buyers. 
  Conservative forecasts have put the Chinese auto parts 
market 
at some 5.7 billion U.S. dollars by the year 2000. 
  Many foreign companies and manufacturers have promised to 
elbow in for a share of the China market, by developing new 
models that suit Chinese living standards and transportation 
facilities. 
  The Beijing international automotive industry exhibition, 
first started in 1990, is held every other year. Some 200,000 
people are expected to visit this year's exhibition, which ends 
on June 29.

<F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Shipping Industry to Let in Foreigners"] </F>
  [Text] China is opening the shipping industry to foreign 
investors as it gets ready to rejoin the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), a senior official said yesterday in 
Beijing. 
  Under the plan, foreign companies will be able to handle 
cargo at Chinese ports and operate some inland and coastal 
shipping routes. 
  Huang Zhendong, Minister of Communications, said it will 
bring China's marine shipping policies in line with 
international norms. 
  He said overseas shipping firms will be allowed to handle 
cargo at Chinese ports open to foreign vessels, and to operate 
shipping lines to and from the ports with approval. 
  "Upon endorsement, they can even run joint ventures to 
handle 
shipping on coastal routes or inland rivers," he said. 
  However, the Chinese partner must have a majority stake in 
the company and hold senior and legal posts. Vessels must also 
be approved by the ministry and fly Chinese flags. 
  Foreign firms can set up wholly-owned agencies to canvass 
cargo, issue documents and negotiate contracts for their ships. 
  But such agencies will be unable to serve domestic 
waterways, 
Huang said. 
  By the end of last year, 190 firms were engaged in 
international shipping in China, 56 of which were Sino-foreign 
joint ventures with an aggregate capacity of 21.8 million DWTs 
(dead weight tons). 
  Three foreign independent subsidiaries two from the U.S. and 
one from Norway, have received the right to handle agent 
services for their fleet. 
  Huang also promised a favourable environment and increased 
transparency to entice investment into docks and roads. 
  "We have drafted provincial rules governing the use of 
foreign investment in highway and waterway construction," he 
said, but declined to say when they would be released. 
  He said foreign businesses are being encouraged to start 
joint or wholly-owned ventures to build wharves and construct 
and operate highway projects. 
  But Chinese must have a majority share in joint ventures 
that 
build public docks vital to the national economy. 
  Huang also said the ministry will present a list in the near 
future of infrastructure projects that promise high economic 
returns and are in line with State industrial policies. 
  Foreign investors have built container or chemicals 
terminals 
in Nanjing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenzhen, while more projects are 
under discussion. 
  Huang praised Guangdong as being the vanguard in the 
country's use of foreign investment in highway construction. 
The province has entered contracts or letters of intent with a 
total foreign pledged input of $3.5 billion. 
  But at the moment China is attracting the most money in the 
form of foreign loans. 
  Since 1980, the ministry has utilized about $2.5 billion in 
loans from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, and 290 
billion yen in loans from the Japanese Government.

  [Text] Wuhan, June 24 (XINHUA) -- China's leading inland 
waterway shipping company has developed a new strategy to expand 
shipping capacity along the Chang Jiang River. 
  The Chang Jiang River Shipping Corporation (Group) plans to 
extend its navigation routes both to the east and west along the 
country's longest river, so that foreign vessels can directly 
transport their cargoes to the inland areas. 
  As the first trial shipping enterprise group designated by 
the State Council, the corporation now has 110,000 employees and 
2,548 ships, with fixed assets of 5.26 billion yuan (about 650 
million U.S. dollars). 
  Its annual handling capacity of goods is 80 million tons, 51 
percent of the total along the Yangtze. It can also carry 35 
million passengers a year, 99 percent of the total. 
  China has given approval to 13 Chang Jiang ports to open to 
foreign vessels. Now 10,000-dwt [deadweight ton] ships can 
reach Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu Province, and 5,000-dwt ships 
can anchor at Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province. 
  By the end of March this year more than 3,000 foreign ships 
had entered the Yangtze. 
  Over 50 Chang Jiang ports in Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi and 
Hubei provinces have established shipping ties with 50 foreign 
counterparts. 
  The Chang Jiang flows 6,300 km from the Qinghai-Tibet 
plateau 
to Shanghai, where it empties into the sea. The river is the 
third-longest in the world, after the Nile and the Amazon.

  [Text] Hangzhou, June 24 (XINHUA) -- China has made marked 
achievements in revitalizing cotton production thanks to the 
widespread application of new cotton growing techniques. 
  According to an on-going national conference on cotton 
production here, the new techniques widely applied include 
improved strains of seeds that promise high yield and resistance 
to diseases, plastic film covering in the early period of 
growth, application of mixed fertilizer, transplantation of 
cotton seedlings and sowing of de-haired seeds. 
  Over the past five years, nearly ten varieties of improved 
cotton strains, including Zhongmian 12, Zhongmian 16, Zhongmian 
17, Lumian 10 and Emian 18, have been widely applied. The 
Simian 3 developed by Jiangsu Province boosts per unit cotton 
yield by about 20 percent as compared with common varieties. 
The de-haired cotton seeds have been extensively applied in 
Anhui and Xinjiang. 
  Xinjiang, which reported a good cotton harvest last year 
despite the widespread drop in output in other areas of the 
country, uses plastic film covering in 96 percent of its cotton 
fields and Shandong applied plastic film covering and seedling 
nursing and transplantation in three-fourths of its cotton 
growing areas. 
  The photosynthesized trace element fertilizer, which can 
raise cotton yield by at least 10 percent, is also widely used. 
  China is one of the biggest cotton growers in the world. Its 
annual output hit a record 6.25 million tons in 1984. But over 
the past two years, due to infestation of cotton bollworms, 
adverse weather conditions and reduction in cotton growing 
acreage, the cotton output has dropped for two successive years 
to 3.76 million tons in 1993. 
  The central government has made great efforts to boost 
cotton 
acreage since the beginning of this year and achieved some 
results. Reports from various places show that the cotton 
acreage this year is much more than last and all localities have 
adopted early preventive measures against cotton bollworms that 
have eaten up millions of tons of cotton over the past two years.

  [Text] Lhasa, June 24 (XINHUA) -- Zhang Yun, a livestock 
expert in Tibet, has devoted 11 years to upgrading the breeding 
rate of yaks. 
  He wanted to curb the degeneration tendency of domestic 
yaks, 
and by using artificial insemination, Zhang has raised the 
reproduction rate of domestic yaks from 35 percent to 70 percent. 
  It is estimated that there are 13 million yaks in China, 
about 90 percent of the total number in the world. They live on 
plateau grasslands with altitudes between 3,000 m to 5,000 m. 
  For hundreds of years, yaks in their bitter living 
conditions 
have been closely bound up with the millions of Tibetans in 
western China, providing the latter with meat, milk, fur and 
animal power. 
  "However, during the past several decades, the quality of 
yaks in some places has degenerated and their reproduction 
ability got lowered," said Zhang. "The main reason was the 
worsening of the grassland and inbreeding of yaks." 
  According to an investigation, a male yak during the 1950s 
might weigh about 460 kg, but now it weighs only about 300 kg. 
Similarly, one female yak four decades ago could turn out 200 
kg of milk a year; now it can produce only 120 kg. Inbreeding 
also made the reproduction rate and survival rate fairly low. 
  Zhang thinks that artificial insemination can avoid use of 
many male yaks so that more grassland can be saved and 
inbreeding avoided. 
  In 1984 he took up the study of the frozen semen 
reproduction 
technique. He is now in charge of a frozen semen station in 
Damxung county in the Tibet Autonomous Region, where the semen 
is collected from strong wild yaks and their first generation. 
  At the beginning of his work, he went up to an area of 
plateau grassland together with an assistant and worked on eight 
yaks. 
  "Male yaks have a hot temper, and it is rather troublesome 
to 
tame them," he said. However, in five months, without resorting 
to whipping or electric shock, they found a way to get on good 
terms with yaks. 
  After training, the eight male yaks were docile enough for 
the workers to collect semen. 
  In August that year, Zhang and his co-workers carried out 
artificial insemination of 60 female yaks which gave birth to 40 
calves the next year; the reproduction rate was 66 percent. 
  In order to spread the insemination technique throughout 
Tibet, Zhang wants to set up a modern frozen yak semen center. 
"There are 124 frozen semen centers nationwide, but not one yak 
semen bank yet," Zhang said. 
  Zhang's work won support from the late Tibetan religious 
leader, the 10th Bainqen Lama, who showed great concern for the 
development of livestock and application of new techniques in 
Tibet. 
  "In a sense, we work hard starting from scratch in order to 
complete the wish of the Bainqen," Zhang said. 
  With the support of the central and and local government, 
they are building a high-grade frozen yak semen center with 
semen processing workshops and laboratories. They are also 
considering introducing modern equipment with international aid.

  [Text] Washington, June 23 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher informed his counterparts of South 
Korea, Japan and Russia the response by the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea (DPRK) last night on his way home from 
Brussels, the State Department said here today. 
  The U.S. Administration received formal confirmation from 
the 
DPRK yesterday that it will freeze the major elements of its 
nuclear program while a new round of talks between the U.S. and 
the DPRK proceeds. 
  Christopher had discussions on the new situation in the DPRK 
with South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Japanese Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa, department spokesman Mike McCurry said at a news 
briefing. 
  They used that discussions to "really begin to build a 
framework of consultations for the upcoming third round of 
talks," McCurry said. 
  The spokesman explained that in every step along the way in 
dealing with this crisis the United States had used "very 
careful and precise diplomacy" to first build international 
support for sanction efforts at the United Nations. 
  "We will use exactly that some type of approach now in 
building a common understanding and foundation for the type of 
dialogue that we now seek to have with the DPRK," he said. 
  In answering a question, McCurry said the response from the 
DPRK "specifically addressed the types of concerns that we 
raised." 
  "We are quite satisfied that the response was detailed 
enough," he added. 
  McCurry said U.S. Administration officials have had a good 
exchange with DPRK officials on dates of a new round of talks 
between the two countries. But he refused to disclose them. 
  President Bill Clinton said yesterday the United States was 
ready to hold the third round of talks with the DPRK in Geneva 
early next month.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 23 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- An 
authoritative Beijing source disclosed that, accompanied by 
Central Military Commission Vice Chairman Liu Huaqing, Deng 
Xiaoping toured Qingdao, Shandong recently and talked about 
three fundamental issues concerning the development of the state. 
  Deng Xiaoping pointed out that first, except when an 
inevitable large-scale war breaks out, the principle of taking 
economic development as the center must never change, the policy 
of reform and opening up must never change, and the party's 
basic line must remain unshakable for 100 years to come. 
  Second, it is necessary to sum up the lesson of the former 
Soviet Union and it is necessary to properly handle the 
relationship between the center and the localities. 
  Third, it is necessary to stick to the CPC's leadership and 
the CPC's ruling status must never be shaken. China must not 
pursue a multiparty system. 
  A report carried in Hong Kong WEN WEI PO today said that 
Deng 
Xiaoping has requested party and government cadres to take note 
of upholding these three issues, which have already been relayed 
to central high-ranking personalities.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] Patriarch Deng Xiaoping has asked China's top 
generals to safeguard an orderly succession and to defuse unrest 
that might occur after his death. 
  Chinese sources said while Mr Deng's health remained 
precarious, he was fit enough to do short-term travelling. 
  Leaving weighty matters of state to lieutenants including 
President Jiang Zemin and Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, the patriarch 
has devoted his energy to ensuring a smooth succession. 
  Informed sources said in a secret talk to about 20 senior 
generals earlier this year, Mr Deng spelled out a two-pronged 
strategy for guaranteeing a trouble-free succession. 
  "Rally round comrade Jiang Zemin as the core of the new 
leadership," Mr Deng told the gathering of top brass, who 
included former president Yang Shangkun, one of Mr Jiang's major 
rivals. 
  "Uphold political stability at all costs. Provide help to 
the party and the Government in maintaining social order. 
Bolster central authority and check the growth of regionalism." 
  The patriarch specifically asked his long-time 
comrade-in-arms General Liu Huaqing to help Mr Jiang, Mr Deng's 
successor as Central Military Commission (CMC) chairman, 
consolidate his hold over the People's Liberation Army and the 
paramilitary People's Armed Police. 
  Under Mr Deng's overall guidance, Mr Jiang, General Liu and 
the generals laid down contingency plans through which urban 
riots could be contained and defused. 
  Military sources said after having secured the loyalty of 
the 
generals, including the commanders and commissars of the eight 
military regions, Mr Deng and Vice-chairman of the CMC, General 
Liu, are confident that the centrifugal tendencies of a number 
of powerful regional cadres could be held in check. 
  In return, the army officers have been assured a big budget 
and a large say in civilian matters, particularly foreign policy. 
  The Chinese-run Hong Kong daily, WEN WEI PO, reported 
yesterday that Mr Deng recently toured Qingdao in eastern 
Shandong province. 
  It quoted authoritative sources in Beijing as saying Mr Deng 
was accompanied by General Liu and that he had given 
instructions on maintaining stability. 
  The report was yesterday denied by the Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin. 
  Asked to clarify Mr Deng's whereabouts, Mr Wu said: "Mr Deng 
Xiaoping is wherever he is." 
  Sources in Beijing said however, that Mr Deng had indeed 
travelled out of Beijing, and that he had spent time with 
General Liu on ways to promote stability. 
  The sources said the senior leader paid a week-long visit to 
Shanghai in late April. 
  The patriarch's recent edicts are similar to those reported 
in WEN WEI PO yesterday. 
  "To ensure the longevity of Communist-Party rule, we must 
absolutely not change the policy of taking economic construction 
as the national core," Mr Deng reportedly said. 
  "Taking the lesson from the former Soviet Union, we must 
handle well the relationship between the centre and the regions. 
  "We must uphold Communist Party leadership The ruling status 
of the Communist Party must no be compromised. China cannot 
have a multi-party system." 
  What WEN WEI PO has not reported is that Mr Deng has given 
instructions to the PLA, his major power base to "provide 
imperial escort" to his policy.

<F P=106> [By Peter Seidlitz in Shanghai] </F>
  [Text] Heavy losses on the metal futures markets in 
Shanghai and London have triggered firm action from Chinese 
authorities. 
  Prominent traders have been detained, an investigation team 
dispatched from Beijing to Shanghai and personnel changes made 
in leading Shanghai trading companies. According to 
highly-placed sources, several hundreds of millions of United 
States dollars were lost last year when Chinese traders dealing 
through U.S. and British investment houses ordered huge amounts 
of copper at top prices for China's strategic stockpiles without 
the central government's consent. Prices collapsed and caused 
an uproar in the People's Bank of China, the central bank 
chaired by Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, sources said. 
  Several high-rolling and well-known Shanghai traders had 
been 
detained. Under detention were two employees of the 
metal-trading department of Shanghai CITIC [China International 
Trust and Investment Corporation]. 
  An investigation had also been launched against an official 
of the Shanghai Machinery and Electrical Bureau, who alone was 
alleged to be responsible for the huge trading losses on the 
London Metals Exchange, according to the sources. Several other 
companies which also suffered losses were also under 
investigation. 
  "The futures trading losses in Shanghai made the Beijing 
government realise that commodity trading was becoming a casino 
for rich individuals and government companies," said a trader in 
Beijing. Sources close to Mr Zhu, an advocate of strong central 
government action and discipline, claim he was furious with the 
losses made as a result of speculation in Shanghai. 
  "The futures markets were intended originally for price 
monitoring, not market speculation. The markets were totally 
misused when people thought they could become rich overnight on 
commodity market speculation, said the traders. As a result, 
the central government has further tightened controls on trading 
in metals as well as other commodities. 
  All foreign currency allocations needed for letters of 
credits in the commodities field must now be approved by the 
People's Bank and other relevant central authorities. In 
addition, several metal futures departments of Shanghai 
companies were closed. 
  In the last two years traders could get letters of credit 
from Chinese banks that organised currency on provincial swap 
markets opening the door for favours and special relationships 
between commodity traders and swap centres' foreign currency 
allocation managers. Beijing wanted to stop this practice and 
recentralise decisions. 
  The huge losses in Shanghai are not unique. Mr Zhu was 
reportedly equally furious when during a recent inspection tour 
of provinces in northern China he discovered that enormous steel 
orders had been made with Russia outside central government 
plans and without Beijing's knowledge. Last year, China also 
suffered huge losses when large amounts of steel were imported 
to feed the building industry. 
  Hong Kong traders made a fortune in deals with Chinese 
companies which stockpiled steel only to see the building 
industry and prices collapse. Steel exports to China this year 
have fallen dramatically. But the central government was said 
to have been particularly annoyed at the recent Shanghai case as 
traders were speculating with orders for strategic stockpile 
reserves, for which selected trustworthy Chinese companies can 
buy on behalf of the government. 
  The huge copper orders were for government reserves. The 
Ministry of Finance now has to foot the bill for commodity 
reserves. which were purchased at the highest possible world 
prices. 
  Mr Zhu is now on a confrontation course with the leading 
brokerage houses that were main advocates of commodity future 
markets.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by Fujian Provincial Statistics Bureau; </F>
date not given: "Statistical Report Issued by Fujian Provincial 
Statistics Bureau on National Economic and Social Development in 
1993"] 
  [Text] Under the leadership of the provincial party 
committee and government in 1993, the people of the whole 
province continued to implement the spirit of the 14th CPC 
Congress, earnestly enforced the measures of the CPC Central 
Committee and State Council on strengthening macroeconomic 
control and regulation, and maintained sustained, rapid, and 
healthy growth of the national economy. The comprehensive 
strength of the national economy was further enhanced, new 
strides were made in foreign economy and trade, the people's 
living standards continued to improve, and successes were made 
in science, technology, education, culture, public health, and 
other social undertakings. According to preliminary statistics, 
Gross Domestic Product totaled 95.349 billion yuan, an increase 
of 25.4 percent over 1992. Of this, added value in secondary 
industry totaled 44.632 billion yuan, up 41.8 percent, and 
tertiary industry reached 27.817 billion yuan, up 19.7 percent. 
Gross National Product was four times the figure in 1980, 
attaining the strategic objective of quadrupling national income 
seven years ahead of schedule. The main problems in economic 
operations included: Some state enterprises lacked vitality in 
their operations and production, the investment setup remained 
irrational, market prices rose sharply, and the development of 
basic industries and facilities could not meet the needs of 
rapid national economic growth. 
<H5>  1. Agriculture </H5>
  Agricultural production and the rural economy continued to 
grow. The added value of agriculture totaled 22.9 billion yuan, 
an increase of 7.5 percent over 1992. 
  The province speedily readjusted its crops. The sown area of 
grain was reduced, while that of cash crops was increased. 
Grain yields per unit area and output of edible oil, tobacco, 
fruit, and tea all reached all-time highs.

  Forestry production progressed. The province planted 956,500 
mu of land, attained great achievements in the "357" project, 
and covered all barren hills with green trees. Fujian tops the 
nation in afforestation, winning the title of "advanced province 
in afforesting barren hills." 
  Animal husbandry developed steadily, and output of meat, 
poultry, eggs, milk, and animal by-products increased.

  Fishery production developed further. Output of aquatic 
products reached 1.9036 million tonnes, an increase of 19 
percent over 1992. Of this, output of freshwater products 
amounted to 190,000 tonnes, up 41 percent and for saltwater, 
1.7136 million tons, up 17 percent. Famous brand, special, and 
quality aquatic products developed remarkably on a large scale. 
  Conditions for rural production further improved. By the 
end of 1993, the aggregate power capacity of farm machinery 
reached 6.935 million kilowatts, an increase of 7.4 percent over 
the previous year. There were 153,100 small tractors, up 3.3 
percent, and 16,500 trucks for farming purposes, up 10.7 
percent. A total of 922,400 tonnes (in terms of 100 percent 
ingredients) of chemical fertilizers were applied in 1993, a 
drop of 0.9 percent from 1992. Rural areas consumed 2.917 
billion kwh of electricity, up 8.4 percent. Irrigated areas 
increased by 138,600 mu. 
<H5>  2. Industry and Construction </H5>
  Fujian's industrial economy developed rapidly in 1993. The 
output value of industry totaled 36.226 billion yuan, an 
increase of 44 percent over the previous year, the highest 
growth registered since reform and opening up. Light industry 
developed comprehensively, with an added value of 21.781 billion 
yuan, an increase of 50 percent over 1992. Added value of heavy 
industry amounted to 14.445 billion yuan, up 34 percent. 
  Of various economic sectors, industry in the nonpublic 
sector 
maintained its momentum, and state sector industry developed 
rapidly. Added value in the state industry totaled 12.151 
billion yuan, an increase of 9.3 percent over 1992; the 
collective sector, 14.828 billion yuan, up 65 percent; and the 
three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises, 6.011 billion yuan, 
up 68 percent. 
  In the face of fierce market competition, industrial 
enterprises accelerated the readjustment of their product mix.

  Industrial production converged with marketing and 
industrial 
economic efficiency improved remarkably. Sales of industry at 
above township level totaled 91.176 billion yuan, a 36.2 percent 
rise over 1992. The sales rate of manufactured goods reached 
96.6 percent, an increase of 1.7 percentage points. The 
composite efficiency index of independent accounting industrial 
enterprises at and above township levels was 105.64, an increase 
of 4.9 percentage points over 1992. 
  The ability to earn more foreign exchange from industrial 
exports was further enhanced. The number of enterprises with 
the right to independently export their goods increased from 53 
in 1992 to 80. The output value of exports by industrial 
enterprises at and above township level totaled 21.596 billion 
yuan, 6 billion yuan more than in the previous year. 
  The building trade maintained growth in production and 
vigorously opened up new markets. The output value of the 
building trade totaled 8.406 billion yuan, an increase of 28.3 
percent over 1992. Based on calculations of the output value of 
construction, overall labor productivity was 27,398 yuan, an 
increase of 48.5 percent over the previous year. The floor 
space of buildings under construction was 16.124 million square 
meters, with 6.475 million square meters completed during the 
year, an increase of 24.7 percent and 12.6 percent respectively 
over the previous year, both hitting an all-time high since the 
introduction of reform and opening up. 
  3. Investment in Fixed Assets 
  Fujian's urban and rural construction entered a new stage of 
rapid growth in 1993 and investment in fixed assets rose 
sharply. Investment in fixed assets totaled 33.8 billion yuan, 
an increase of 71.4 percent over 1992 or a real increase of 27.8 
percent after allowing for price hikes. Of this, investment by 
state-owned units was 23.5 billion yuan, up 89 percent; 
collective units, 3.3 billion yuan, up 44.9 percent; and the 
private sector, 7 billion yuan, up 39.4 percent. There were 
2,067 capital construction and technical transformation projects 
invested by state-owned units, 622 less than in 1992, accounting 
for 47 percent of the total number of construction projects. 
  Of investment in fixed assets by state-owned units, 
investment in capital construction totaled 12.3 billion yuan, up 
73 percent over 1992; technical transformation, 4.9 billion 
yuan, up 66.3 percent; commercial housing, 5.9 billion yuan, up 
176.9 percent; and other fields, 400 million yuan, up 94.9 
percent. Of investment in capital construction and technical 
transformation, investment by the center totaled 3.3 billion 
yuan, up 29.5 percent, and that by local units was 13.9 billion 
yuan, up 84.8 percent. 
  The investment setup changed somewhat. Of investment in 
fixed assets by state-owned units, investment in the industry 
was 300 million yuan, up 23 percent over 1992, and its 
proportion dropped from 1.7 percent to 1.1 percent; investment 
in secondary industry totaled 9.1 billion yuan, up 62.5 percent, 
and its overall share dropped from 45.3 percent to 38.8 percent; 
and investment in tertiary industry amounted to 14.1 billion 
yuan, up 115.3 percent, and its proportion increased from 53 
percent to 60.1 percent, of which investment in transportation, 
post, and telecommunications rose from 14.7 percent a year ago 
to 15.2 percent. 
  The year 1993 was a "year of infrastructure construction" 
for 
Fujian. In view of the central government's spirit of 
macroeconomic regulation and control, Fujian suspended a number 
of construction projects, curtailed the scope of some 
investment, and strengthened key construction projects and basic 
facilities. Key construction projects basically completed or in 
operation included the No. 1 generating unit of the Shuikou 
Hydropower Plant, the Nanyi Reservoir, the electrification of 
the Zhangzhou-Xiamen section of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railroad, the 
first-phase project of the Fuzhou New Port and a 7,500-ton 
capacity passenger port, the Fujian Oil Refinery, the Third Min 
Jiang Bridge, and a water plant in Fuzhou's western district. 
  Newly increased production capacity in 1993 through capital 
construction projects included: 510,000 tonnes of 
cargo-handling capacity, 220,000 kw of power generation 
capacity, 95.9 km of power lines, 600,000 volts of power 
transformer equipment, 150,000 tonnes of daily water supply, 158 
million cubic meters of water storage, 416,300 places for 
students in various types of schools, 54,400 telephone sets in 
urban areas, 5 bridges with a total length of 6,215 meters, 61 
km of highways, and the renovation of 209 km of highways. 
<H5>  4. Transportation, Posts, Telecommunications </H5>
  Fujian's "advance project" proceeded smoothly in 1993: The 
Yingtan-Xiamen railway was the first one to be electrified in 
eastern China, Fujian was the first province in China to attain 
programmed networks and digital transmission in post and 
telecommunications at and above county level, highway 
transportation was unprecedentedly busy, a trial flight at 
Wuyishan Airport was a success, and "bottlenecks" eased 
somewhat. The added value of transportation, post, and 
telecommunications was 5.115 billion yuan, an increase of 29.5 
percent over 1992.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Post and telecommunications developed rapidly, with a volume 
of 2.422 billion yuan, up 64.9 percent over 1992. New 
functional services developed by leaps and bounds. By the end 
of 1993, the number of pager and mobile phone subscribers 
totaled 418,100 and 28,200, an increase of 190 percent and 159 
percent respectively over the previous year. The capacity of 
long-distance automatic switchboards was 105,700, up 178 
percent, and the switchboard capacity in urban and rural areas 
was 1.4763 million, up 84.5 percent. Of this, dialing 
telephones accounted for 93.1 percent. Long-distance telephone 
services and the number of urban and rural telephone subscribers 
increased by 83.1 percent and 75.4 percent respectively. 
  5. Domestic Trade and Market Prices 
  The domestic market for consumer goods continued to 
flourish. 
Retail sales of consumer goods in 1993 were 38.326 billion yuan, 
up 32.4 percent (or real growth of 16.3 percent allowing for 
price rises). Of this, sales at urban markets totaled 20.027 
billion yuan, up 40.1 percent, while sales in rural areas came 
to 18.299 billion yuan, up 25 percent. Despite an ample supply 
of consumer goods in the market, there was a great demand for 
high-grade goods. Transactions were brisk. Of sales of various 
consumer goods, growth and decreases were registered in the 
consumption of different food items: Grain, down 3.1 percent; 
edible oil, up 0.5 percent; pork, up 8.9 percent; and garments, 
up 27.5 percent. Sales of color television sets, washing 
machines, refrigerators, range hoods, air conditioners, and 
other durable consumer goods increased rapidly. There was a 
great demand for cosmetics, high-grade toys, and decorative 
articles. Other trades related to real estate rose 176.8 
percent over the previous year. 
  Retail sales of various types of commodities increased. 
Sales by the state sector rose 21.3 percent; by the collective 
sector, up 30.2 percent; and by the individual sector, up 44.2 
percent. A 29.3 percent rise was registered in transactions 
between farmers and nonagricultural persons. 
  Means of production markets continued to develop. Total 
purchases of the means of production by material supply and 
marketing departments in the whole province were 10.5 billion 
yuan, an increase of 58.2 percent over the previous year, while 
their sales amounted to 11 billion yuan, up 58.3 percent. Sales 
of rolled steel totaled 1.41 million tonnes, up 18.5 percent; 
caustic soda, 16,000 tonnes, up 20 percent; and trucks, 17,000, 
up 22.2 percent. The proportion of sales regulated by the market 
reached 97 percent, a rise of 5.6 percentage points over 1992. 
  Reform of the price system deepened further. The province 
lifted restrictions on prices of grain, edible oil, China-made 
cigarettes, iron ore, and manganese; readjusted prices for 
electricity, coal, salt for industrial purposes, cement, plastic 
sheeting for spring plowing, paper for press units, and embossed 
paper; strengthened management over real estate prices; and 
further rationalized prices. 
  The overall increase in market prices was rather high, in 
particular for service charges, investment in fixed assets, and 
energy and raw materials.

<H5>  6. Foreign Economy </H5>
  Foreign trade expanded further. According to foreign trade 
statistics, the volume of Fujian's imports and exports totaled 
$9.867 billion, up 49.9 percent over 1992. This included $5.825 
billion of exports, up 36.3 percent. Exports from the Xiamen 
Special Economic Zone accounted for 38.5 percent of the 
province's total, up 3.3 percentage points over 1992. 
  A new high tide appeared in foreign investment. In 1993, the 
province newly approved the establishment of 4,714 
foreign-funded enterprises, involving an agreed upon capital of 
$11.37 billion, an increase of 79 percent over the previous year 
and exceeding the sum of the past 14 years. The province 
actually used $2.87 billion of foreign capital, an increase of 
102 percent over 1992 and 92 percent of the sum of the past 14 
years. The average scale of foreign-funded enterprises reached 
$2.41 million, 18 percent higher than in the previous year. A 
total of 5,753 foreign-funded enterprises were completed and 
went into operation in 1993. 
  New headway was made in foreign economic and technological 
cooperation. Fujian contracted 3,172 foreign construction 
projects and labor service projects worth $680 million, an 
increase of 63.6 percent and 36.5 percent respectively over 
1992. The accomplished operation revenue reached $397 million, 
up 44.1 percent. By the end of 1993, the number of people 
working abroad totaled 29,800, 39 percent more than in the 
previous year. 
  International tourism developed rapidly. Fujian received 
193,000 foreign tourists, up 21.4 percent over 1992, and 668,400 
Chinese compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, up 5.6 
percent. Foreign exchange income from tourism amounted to $160 
million, up 11.1 percent over 1992. 
  7. Banking, Insurance, Taxation 
  In 1993, Fujian strengthened macroeconomic regulation and 
control, made strenuous efforts to muster and accommodate funds, 
readjusted the credit structure, and maintained stability in the 
banking order. At the end of 1993, savings deposits of various 
forms in the province's banks totaled 14.781 billion yuan. Of 
this, enterprise savings deposits increased by 5.024 billion 
yuan, and urban and rural savings deposits rose 6.712 billion 
yuan. Various forms of loans rose 17.155 billion yuan, of which 
circulating loans increased by 11.595 billion yuan and loans for 
fixed assets rose by 3.166 billion yuan. 
  Marked progress was made in insurance services. Premiums for 
various kinds of insurance in 1993 totaled 319.7 billion yuan, 
and income from insurance services amounted to 2.08 billion 
yuan, an increase of 59.9 percent over the previous year. 
Through deepening reform, changing operational mechanisms, 
optimizing the insurance structure, and improving management, 
the insurance departments attained relatively fair achievements. 
Some 25,000 enterprises and 1.51 million households 
participated in property insurance programs and 14.75 million 
persons in life insurance programs. A total of 390,000 motor 
vehicles were insured. Insurance companies took 358,000 
domestic claims and paid indemnity for 80,000 cases of property 
losses, 270,000 cases of loss of life, and 5,900 cases related 
to foreigners, which made contributions to stabilizing the 
economy and the people's livelihood. 
  New headway was made in taxation work. In 1993, the province 
received 9.197 billion yuan of industrial and commercial taxes, 
up 53.8 percent; 1.193 billion yuan of taxes from self-employed 
businessmen, up 45.1 percent; and 162 million yuan of income 
regulatory taxes from individuals, up 67 percent. 
<H5>  8. Science and Technology </H5>
  New progress was registered in science and technology. 
Fujian won 3 national spark awards, 172 provincial scientific 
and technological progress awards, 2 provincial scientific, 
technological, and foreign economic awards, and 13 provincial 
spark awards in 1993. Major scientific and technological 
achievements in 1993 included: comprehensive research on 
harnessing the lower reaches of the Min Jiang, a full set of 
technology for the construction of residential houses in towns, 
a study of diameter drilling and grouting capacity, molded foam 
EVA plastic, double wave-length continuous laser devices, and 
film machinery, which produced marked economic and social 
effects. 
  In 1993, the province carried out 178 national and 
provincial 
high-tech and torch schemes and developed 178 high-tech 
products, which added 2.3 billion yuan of efficiencies. The 
proportion of scientific and technological factors in the 
national economy increased remarkably. Fujian submitted 1,271 
patent applications to the China Patent Bureau in 1993, of which 
850 were approved. 
  The province enhanced the scientific and technological 
development capacity of enterprises. Investment in technical 
transformation totaled 3.353 billion yuan, an increase of 62.1 
percent over 1992. Large and medium-size industrial enterprises 
in Fujian had 151 special technological development offices, 
with 9,724 technicians. The ratio of special technological 
development offices and technicians for every 100 large and 
medium size enterprises increased by 0.2 percent and 1.7 percent 
respectively over 1992. Of 1,246 new products which went into 
operation, 138 reached world levels, 176 were national 
innovations, and 485 reached advanced national levels. 
  Import of advanced foreign technology were upgraded. The 
province approved imports of 64 advanced technologies in 1993, 
worth $120 million, or an increase of 107 percent over the same 
period in 1992. Both the scope and level of technological 
imports were upgraded, which accelerated the pace of technical 
transformation in old enterprises and increased the staying 
power of development. 
  New achievements were recorded in geological work. The 
province discovered 8 mines, made marked progress in surveying 
one mine, and verified reserves of 1.4884 million tonnes of 
gold, silver, and copper and 5.176 million tonnes of heavy metal 
ores. Geological departments submitted information on two 
bases, completed 4,932 square km of geological surveys on the 
scale of 1:50,000, and completed 74 million square km of 
gravimetric surveys on the scale of 1:200,000. Geohydrology, 
engineering geology, and environmental geology continued to play 
an important role in national economic construction. 
  Surveying work was further developed. The surveying 
departments used 144,000 working days to complete the drafting 
of 832 charts and the controlling of 959 charts, complete 1,782 
engineering survey maps and 413 relief maps, print 3,088 reams 
of maps, and complete 11,388 square km of aerial surveying. 
They also published 48 kinds of books. 
  In 1993, state-owned institutions in Fujian had 484,200 
professionals and technicians. There were 115 state-owned 
independent natural scientific and technological research 
institutes at and above prefectural and city levels, with a 
total of 8,708 staff members, of which 4,802 had senior titles. 
  The technology market remained active. A total of 4,220 
technological contracts were signed in 1993, with the volume 
reaching 187.58 million yuan, up 38.5 percent over 1992. The 
province held 16 technology trade fairs. A total of 6,083 
technology items were displayed and 344 contracts were signed, 
with the volume amounting to 226.68 million yuan. 
<H5>  9. Education and Culture </H5>
  Education developed vigorously. The 33 universities and 
colleges in Fujian enrolled 512 postgraduates, bringing the 
total number of postgraduates to 1,372. In the year, 394 
postgraduates completed their degrees. Institutions of higher 
learning enrolled 23,900 students and had a student body of

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Gansu Provincial Statistics Bureau </F>
on 15 March 1994: "Statistical Report Issued by the Gansu 
Provincial Statistics Bureau on National Economic and Social 
Development in 1993"] 
  [Text] In 1993, revolving around the overall goal of 
establishing a socialist market economic system and in light of 
the actual conditions in the province, departments in the whole 
province strengthened and improved macroregulation and control, 
worked hard to overcome the difficulties encountered in their 
path, and, with the concerted efforts of the general public of 
all nationalities, made new achievements in various undertakings 
of development. The national economy maintained a sustained, 
healthy, and relatively fast growth, and social undertakings 
moved ahead in a coordinated manner. According to a preliminary 
survey, the GDP of the province throughout the year registered 
34.9 billion yuan, up 10.7 percent over the previous year, of 
which: The added value in the secondary industry was 15.7 
billion yuan, up 10.9 percent; and that in the tertiary industry 
was 10.9 billion yuan, up 13.8 percent, its proportion in the 
national economy being 31.1 percent. Some contradictions and 
problems were observed in the course of development. The 
problems in economic operations found expression mainly in the 
following aspects: Commodity prices on the market persistently 
grew at a relatively high rate in comparison with previous 
years; the serious shortage of construction funds continued; the 
development of basic industries and basic facilities failed to 
satisfy the demands of economic development; and structural 
contradictions failed to be effectively alleviated and the gaps 
between various sectors expanded. 
<H5>  I. Agriculture </H5>
  Bumper agricultural harvests were reaped and farming, 
forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery developed side by side. 
The comprehensive development of agriculture made smooth 
progress and the commodity grain bases and the scope of 
processing agricultural products expanded. The added value of 
agriculture in the whole year was 8.4 billion yuan, up 6.8 
percent over the previous year. 
  Among all major agricultural products, grain, oil-bearing 
crops, beets, tobacco, and fruit scored the highest outputs in 
history, while cotton yield decreased due to natural factors. 
The commodity rate of agricultural products was 48.2 percent, 
or 2.6 percentage points higher than the previous year, of which 
the commodity rate of grain crops was 23.1 percent and that of 
economic crops was 68.9 percent.

  New achievements were made in forestry. The area of 
afforestation accomplished in 1993 was 2.493 million mu, or 
163,000 mu more than the previous year. The growth of 
commercial forests was more significant, the planted area being 
685,000 mu, representing an increase of 191,000 mu over the 
previous year. The survival rate of new forests somewhat 
improved. The forest coverage rate in the whole province was 
stable, forest fire prevention and disease and pest control were 
given due attention, and there were no forest fires in the whole 
year. By the end of 1993, the area of sapling cultivation, 
113,000 mu, reduced by 16.1 percent in comparison to the 
previous year. The output of major forest products grew to 
various degrees. The output of tung-oil seeds reached 952.1 
metric tons, up 94.6 percent over the previous year. 
  Animal husbandry maintained steady development. Its role in 
overall agricultural production was strengthened; the output of 
pork, beef, and mutton products, poultry, eggs, and milk 
provided by animal husbandry increased; and the commodity rate 
of animal products was increased by 59.7 percent.

  The overall industrial economic efficiency improved. In 
1993, the composite efficiency index of industrial enterprises 
increased to 82.8 percent, or 1.4 percentage points higher than 
the previous year, in which: The sales rate of industrial 
products produced increased from 95.96 percent to 96.73 percent;

productivity, and releases of floating funds all increased to 
various degrees over the previous year, reaching 33.64 percent, 
12,256 yuan per person, and 1.47 times a year, respectively. 
But the gaps between industrial enterprises were outstanding. 
The number of enterprises operating at a loss increased and the 
proportion of such enterprises reached 11.9 percent, of which 
the proportion of state-owned enterprises operating at a loss 
was 24.8 percent, and that of large and medium-sized enterprises 
was 28.5 percent. The total amount of loss increased and the 
amount of loss suffered by large and medium-sized enterprises 
took up 78.1 percent of the total loss industry-wide. 
  The building industry kept developing and operations were 
stable. The total added value reaped during the year was 2.3 
billion yuan, up 15.6 percent over the previous year. The total 
floor space of houses under construction undertaken by 
state-owned construction enterprises during the year was 5.280 
million square meters, up 8.4 percent over the previous year; 
the floor space of completed houses was 4.560 million square 
meters, up 107.8 percent; and the all-personnel labor 
productivity of enterprises increased to 22,961 yuan per person 
and the average profit and tax generated by each person reached

in primary industry was 1.03 billion yuan, an increase of 4.5 
percent over the previous year, the proportion of such 
investment in the total being 10.9 percent. The investment in 
secondary industry was 4.71 billion yuan, up 10.90 percent over

percent. 
  The large and medium-sized, as well as key, construction 
projects province-wide made smooth progress. Infrastructural 
construction was given more attention. The renovation and 
expansion of sections 312 and 109 of national trunk highways was 
completed; the progress of transforming the Baoji-Zhongwei 
railway and the Lanzhou-Urumqi railway into double-track lines 
was accelerated; the expansion of the Yongchang Power Plant 
installing a 100,000 kilowatt generating unit, the 
transformation of Lanzhou Chemical Company introducing ABS 
[preceding initials published in English] production, the 
transformation of Lanshi [5695 4258] Factory's heavy containers, 
and the introduction of titanium dioxide powder in Factory No. 
404 were completed and commissioned. 
  Through capital construction, updating, and transformation, 
the value of fixed assets was increased by 2.72 billion yuan. 
In the meantime, some additional production capacity was 
created, which mainly included the capacity for: Producing 
90,000 metric tons of calcium carbide and 15,000 metric tons of 
titanium dioxide powder; installing 30,000 telephone outlets; 
effectively irrigating 50,000 mu; renovating 175 km of highway; 
producing 40,000 metric tons of synthetic ammonia, 64,000 metric 
tons of urea, 4,000 alternating current servo-generators, 
100,000 kw of thermal-generated electricity, 50,000 boxes of 
cigarettes a year, ABS 10,000 metric tons a year, and 4,000 
metric tons of pressure vessels [as published] per year. 
  IV. Transportation, Post, and Telecommunications 
  Transportation, post, and telecommunications had vigorous 
development and played a positive role in the province's 
economy. The added value of transportation, post, and 
telecommunications reached 1.7 billion yuan during the year, up 
9.3 percent over the previous year. 
  The transport industry overcame many negative factors and 
increased freight volume. But the transport capacity of the 
railway was still lagging behind the needs of economic 
development and the conflict between supply and demand failed to 
ease off.

  The post and telecommunications industry grew rapidly and 
the 
total volume of business during the year was 360 million yuan, 
an increase of 33.3 percent over the previous year. The 
completion and commissioning of the Lanzhou telecommunications 
network expanded telecommunications capacity; 60 cities and 
counties province-wide joined the automatic long-distance 
exchange network, an increase of 39 over the year before; and 
the number of program-controlled telephones in operation in 
urban areas reached 135,000, an increase of 82,000 over the 
previous year. Such new services as radio paging and mobile 
telephone communication quickly expanded and took shape. It 
became fashionable for residents to have a telephone installed. 
At the end of the year, the number of telephone subscribers in 
urban areas totaled 159,000, an increase of 39.5 percent over 
the previous year; and that in rural areas reached 18,000, up 
28.6 percent from the previous year. 
<H5>  V. Domestic Trade and Market Prices </H5>
  The consumer goods market was brisk and active. The retail 
volume of consumer goods throughout the year registered 14.47 
billion yuan, up 21.7 percent from the previous year, in which: 
That in urban areas was 9.36 billion yuan, up 27.2 percent, and 
that in rural areas was 5.11 billion yuan, up 12.7 percent. 
  Among all kinds of consumer goods, the retail volumes of 
commodities for eating, wearing, using [yong 3938], and cooking 
[shao 3599] all increased. The retail volume of clothing scored 
a 28.2 percent increase and that of commodities for using grew 
by 30.5 percent. But the growth of the retail volume of 
commodities for eating slowed down: The growth rates of the 
sales of vegetable oil, fresh eggs, and aquatic products were 
all above 15 percent, while the sales of grain and sugar dropped 
by 30.9 percent and 17.2 percent respectively. Among all 
durable consumer items, the sales of color television sets grew 
by 5.7 percent; video recorders grew by 19.1 percent; and sales 
of refrigerators grew by 13.9 percent; while the sales of 
bicycles, motorcycles, recorders, and electric fans dropped by 
quite large margins. 
  The production means market was brisk. The total volume of 
production means purchased by supply and marketing of materials 
and equipment enterprises at and above the county level was 4.48 
billion yuan, up 16.1 percent from the previous year; and the 
sales volume reached 4.81 billion yuan, up 17.7 percent. The 
sales of agricultural production means was not good enough. The 
annual sales volume was 1.72 billion yuan, up 10.7 percent, 
which, after price increases were factored in, represented an 
actual decrease of 7.7 percent compared to the year before. 
  The building of the market climaxed. At the end of the year, 
the province had a total of 1,682 open fairs, including 401 
specialized and wholesale markets, with a total transaction 
volume of 7 billion yuan. The market of production means made 
vigorous growth, covering 93 markets specializing in timber, 
rolled steel, motor vehicles, and oil, with an annual 
transaction volume of 3 billion yuan. A preliminary network of 
markets at different levels and of different sizes and forms 
took shape. Transactions on the futures market also made a 
start. 
  Because the state stepped up price reform and owing to the 
catalytic effects of many other factors, the general index of 
prices on the market during the year reached a relatively high 
level, which aroused the concern of various departments. The 
livelihood of some residents was affected.

At the end of the year, there were 4,141 medical and health 
institutions province-wide, of which 1,637 were hospitals with 
51,293 beds, up 4.4 percent over the previous year. There were 
78,000 professional health workers, of which 36,000 were 
doctors, representing an increase of 2.2 percent, and 17,000 
were senior nurses and nurses, up 3.4 percent. 
  The province scored a certain degree of success in sports. 
At the Seventh National Games, this province's ranking went up 
and enjoyed the highest total score among the five northwestern 
provinces and autonomous regions. During the year, 32 sportsmen 
from this province took part in seven international events and 
won one first place, four second places, and four third places. 
In domestic contests, this province harvested a total of 10 
gold medals, 16 silvers, and 14 bronzes. Mass sports activities 
were extensively carried out all over the province and 980,000 
students reached the "National Standards of Physical Training." 
<H5>  IX. Population and People's Livelihood </H5>
  The province's population growth continued to be kept under 
control. According to a sampling survey of population changes, 
the birth rate of this province was 20.16 per thousand and the 
death rate was 6.84 per thousand, pushing the natural growth 
rate to 13.32 per thousand, higher than the previous year. The 
net increase of population throughout the year was 310,000 and 
the total population of the province at the end of the year was 
23.45 million. 
  The income of urban and rural residents continued to grow. 
The annual per capita income available for living expenses 
among urban residents was 1,839.4 yuan, an increase of 17.4 
percent over the previous year. The peasants' per capita net 
income increased by 60 yuan and reached 562.9 yuan, which was 
11.9 percent higher than the previous year. The gap in 
residents' income between different localities, between urban 
and rural areas, and between different trades, widened. The pay 
scale of employees was increased. The total payroll for the 
year was 8.38 billion yuan, up 15.9 percent over the previous 
year. The employees' average monetary wages were 3,304.9 yuan, 
up 16.5 percent. Some residents suffered from reduced actual 
income due to price hikes and met with difficulty in covering 
living expenses. The reform of the labor system gradually 
deepened and the general picture of the residents' employment 
was stable. The province had 150 employment agencies of various 
types which registered and made job recommendations for 500,000 
people from various walks of life and found job placements for 
105,000 people in urban areas throughout the year. At the end 
of the year, the unemployment rate [shi ye lu 1136 2814 3769] 
was 3.7 percent. The transfer of rural labor accelerated and 
1.786 million people went into the secondary and tertiary 
industries, up 17.6 percent over the previous year. The number 
of workers in township and town enterprises reached 1.665 
million, up 15.9 percent. At the end of the year, the total 
number of workers in the province was 2.553 million, an increase 
of 1.3 percent over the previous year, of which 2.07 million 
worked in state units, up 1.1 percent, and 466,000 worked in 
urban collectively owned units, up 0.9 percent. The 
introduction of old-age pensions and job-awaiting insurance 
further deepened. 
  Housing in urban and rural areas continued to improve and 
investment in housing construction kept increasing. State units 
invested 1.25 billion yuan in housing construction throughout 
the year, up 26.3 percent from the previous year, and 1.569 
million square meters of floor space were completed. A sampling 
survey indicated that urban residents' per capita living space 
in the whole province was 8.6 square meters, and rural 
residents' per capita living space was 13.8 percent. The 
quality of housing also changed for the better, but irrational 
phenomena in the housing system were still present and the 
actual housing conditions among residents differed greatly. 
  Social welfare steadily developed. At the end of the year, 
the province had 1,275 social welfare units, with 35,000 
employees, and 1,674 beds in various welfare institutions, 
accommodating 1,191 persons. Of all the different types of 
relief recipients in urban and rural areas province-wide, 18,000 
people enjoyed state relief payments and 263,000 temporary state 
relief payments were made. 
  Comprehensive improvement of public security continued and 
citizens' personal safety was basically protected. Throughout 
the year, there were 18,145 criminal cases in the province, of 
which 15,648 were solved within the year, taking up 86.2 percent 
of the total. Some major cases were solved promptly, but the 
overall state of public security was not entirely desirable; 
heinous crimes happened from time to time, drug abuse and 
trafficking were still very serious, and the number of juvenile 
delinquents throughout the year reached 10,971. The general 
public remained very concerned about the state of public 
security. 
<H5>  X. The Province's Economic Status in the Country </H5>
  Preliminary statistics indicate that Gansu maintained a 
basically stable status in the country's economic lineup in 
1993, and there were positive signs of development. Its GDP and 
growth rate ranked 26th and 22d among all the 30 provinces, 
municipalities, and autonomous regions in the country; and third 
and the second among the five northwestern provinces and 
autonomous regions. Its revenue ranked 25th in the country, and 
was the second in the northwest. Its total commodity retail 
volume ranked 25th in the whole country and the third in the 
northwest. The growth rate of retail prices was slightly below 
the national average and ranked 18th in the country and the 
first in the northwest in descending order. In the meantime, 
the proportion of the economy under state ownership in this 
province was significantly higher than the national average. In 
industrial production, state-run industry accounted for 57.6 
percent and township-run industry 19.6 percent in the whole 
country, while in this province, state-run industry accounted 
for 82.6 percent and township-run industry only 7.7 percent. 
Notes: 1. The GDP and added value of various industries 
published in this communique were calculated in terms of the 
year's price levels and the increase rates were calculated in 
terms of comparable prices. 
  2. The data released in this communique are preliminary 
statistical figures.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Guangdong Provincial Statistics </F>
Bureau on 8 March: "Statistical Report Issued by Guangdong 
Provincial Statistics Bureau on National Economic and Social 
Development in 1993"] 
  [Text] In 1993, the Guangdong people further put into 
effect the guidelines set by the 14th CPC National Congress by 
making greater strides in reform, opening to the outside world, 
and the modernization drive, thus enabling the national economy 
to continue to grow rapidly and make achievements in various 
social undertakings. According to preliminary statistics, gross 
domestic product in 1993 reached 314 billion yuan, up 21 percent 
over the previous year. Value added by secondary industry was 
155.9 billion yuan, up 33.3 percent, and that of the tertiary 
industry was 102.3 billion yuan, up 14.6 percent. The principal 
problems of economic development are relatively sharp price 
increases, an excessive scale of investment, and lagging 
agricultural development. 
<H5>  1. Agriculture </H5>
  In 1993, Guangdong vigorously developed a highly efficient 
type of farming which provides greater and better yields to 
boost the overall efficiency of agricultural production. As a 
result, the added value of agriculture in 1993 was 55.8 billion 
yuan, up 3 percent over the previous year, with the gross 
agricultural output value reaching 88.6 billion yuan, up 3.5 
percent. 
  Of staple agricultural products, peanut, vegetables, and tea 
registered greater production than in the previous year. 
Serious natural disasters and a reduced area under cultivation 
led to a reduction in the output of grain, sugar cane, hemp and 
the like, and fruit.

  Achievements were made in afforestation. In 1993, trees were 
planted over an area of 111,400 hectares. A total of 105 
counties (cities and districts) fulfilled the afforestation 
quotas assigned to them, thus enabling Guangdong to basically 
accomplish the task of making the whole province green two years 
ahead of schedule. Guangdong also made progress in developing 
and utilizing colophony, rosin, China fir, Chinese chestnut, and 
other forest products. 
  Animal husbandry grew steadily. As compared with the 1992 
figures, the 1993 outputs of principal livestock products and 
the numbers of animals on hand are as follows: 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Oututs of Principal Livestock Products, Animals on Hand                      |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Fisheries developed at a greater pace. Output of aquatic 
products in 1993 was 2.8075 million tonnes, up 11.8 percent over 
the previous year. Output of freshwater agricultural products 
increased by 18 percent, while that of saltwater agricultural 
products rose 7.5 percent. Progress was also made in tapping 
ocean resources in 1993. 
  Conditions for agricultural production improved. In late 
1993, power produced by farm machinery province-wide totaled 
16.1884 million kw, up 9.6 percent over same period last year; 
power consumption in the countryside came to 12.765 billion kwh, 
up 27.6 percent; fertilizers applied throughout 1993 amounted to 
1.6571 million tonnes (in terms of 100 percent active 
ingredients), down 6.6 percent from the previous year; and the 
area plowed by tractors stood at 787,900 hectares, down 12.1 
percent. 
  Township enterprises continued to grow at a high speed and 
their total income in 1993 amounted to 220 billion yuan, showing 
an increase of 48.9 percent compared with the previous year's 
figure. 
<H5>  2. Industry and Construction </H5>
  Industrial production increased considerably. The added 
value of industry was 126.4 billion yuan in 1993, up 36.6 
percent over the previous year, with the gross industrial output 
value hitting 508.845 billion yuan, up 36.5 percent. For 
industrial enterprises at county level and above, the output 
value of state enterprises increased 14.6 percent, collective 
enterprises 44.6 percent, and that of the other economic sectors 
with foreign-funded enterprises as the mainstay by 42.6 percent. 
Large and medium industrial enterprises made greater steps in 
transforming their managerial mechanisms, and their gross output 
value was up 23.7 percent over the previous year. 
  Light and heavy industries basically progressed 
simultaneously. The 1993 output value of light industry hit 
318.826 billion yuan, up 37.5 percent from the 1992 figure, 
while that of heavy industry reached 190.019 billion yuan, up 
34.5 percent. Affected by changing market needs, output of the 
principal industrial goods varied, with some rising and others 
falling. 
  Compared with the 1992 figures, the 1993 output of principal 
industrial goods was as follows:

  Industrial economic efficiency was raised. The 1993 
composite index number for industrial economic efficiency rose 
to 121.3 from 102.1 in 1992. The 1993 sales rate for industrial 
goods was 96.1 percent, up 0.6 percentage points over the 
previous year; the rate of profits and taxes to capital was 13.1 
percent, up 2.8 percentage points; and all-personnel labor 
productivity (in terms of added value) rose from 15,067 to 
22,286 yuan. However, a relatively large number of state 
enterprises operated at a loss. 
  The construction industry grew quickly. The industry's 1993 
added value was 29.5 billion yuan, up 15.1 percent on the 
previous year. Housing under construction undertaken by state 
building enterprises covered 28.3669 million square meters, up 
36 percent, but housing completed only covered 7.3411 million 
square meters, down 7.2 percent. The industry's 1993 overall 
labor productivity was 30.3 percent higher than the previous 
year, while per-capita profits and taxes increased by 36.6 
percent. 
  Geological prospecting made new progress in 1993. Two areas 
rich in important mineral resources were located, great progress 
was made in three prospecting areas, and more reserves of 
copper, antimony, gold, and kaolin were proven. Geologic 
prospecting teams, using machinery, drilled to a total depth of 
610,000 meters into core rock for mineral deposits 
<H5>  3. Fixed Assets Investment </H5>
  Investment in fixed assets grew rapidly. Fixed-assets 
investment across society in 1993 totaled 146.114 billion yuan, 
up 58.5 percent over the previous year. Fixed-assets investment 
by state-owned units was 103.355 billion yuan, up 71.3 percent; 
by collectively owned units it was 29.594 billion yuan, up 41.4 
percent; and by individual residents in urban and rural areas it 
was 13.165 billion yuan, up 20.6 percent. Of investment by 
state-owned units, 57.089 billion yuan went to infrastructure, 
up 68.6 percent; 19.629 billion yuan to transformation projects, 
up 52.7 percent; and 24.728 billion yuan to building commercial 
housing, up 96.9 percent. Construction projects in progress 
funded by state-owned units was valued at 310.842 billion yuan. 
More projects began construction. 
  The investment pattern continued to be adjusted. Of 
investment in capital construction and transformation, 1.117 
billion yuan was provided to primary industry, up 37.1 percent, 
but its share of total investment dropped to 1.5 from 1.7 
percent in the previous year; 33.837 billion yuan to secondary 
industry, up 59 percent, but its proportion dropped from 45.6 to 
44.1 percent--investment in industries providing energy and 
producing raw and semi-finished materials rose 61.1 percent over 
the previous year's figure with its proportion of total 
investment in secondary industry rising from 55.6 to 56.3 
percent; 41.764 billion yuan went to tertiary industry, up 69.6 
percent, with its share climbing from 52.7 to 54.4 
percent--investment in transport and post and telecommunications 
services increased 64.8 percent over the preceding year, with 
its share of total investment in tertiary industry down from 
56.8 to 55.2 percent. 
  Construction of key projects proceeded smoothly. A total of 
21.626 billion yuan was spent on large and medium projects, 
accounting for 95.4 percent of the relevant planned investment 
in 1993. Investment in key provincial projects amounted to 
15.799 billion yuan, basically fulfilling the 1993 plan. Most 
of the 10 wholly invested [quan tou 0356 2121] projects, 
including the Shajiao A Power Plant Phase Two, were completed as 
planned and the six individually invested [dan tou 0830 2121] 
projects, including the pumped-storage [chou shui xu neng 2132 
3022 5552 5174] Hydroelectric Power Station phase One project 
have gone into operation. 
  Principal productive capacity increased in 1993 included: 
Generating capacity by 3.88 million kw; expressways by 150 km; 
first, second, and third-grade highways by 1,707 km; 199 km of 
railroad put into service; 51 ports, wharfs, and berths; 7.98 
million tonnes of port capacity; 1.12 million telephones 
installed in urban areas; and 8 million tonnes of cement output. 
<H5>  4. Transport and Post and Telecommunications Services </H5>
  Transport and post and telecommunications services were 
expanded in an all-round way. Added value in 1993 was 15.8 
billion yuan, an increase of 20.3 percent over the previous 
year. But "bottlenecks" in transport still presented noteworthy 
restrictions on economic growth, railroads were excessively 
burdened, and the warranted supply rate of railroad cars [che pu 
bao zheng lu 6508 4122 0202 6086 3764] fell.

  Postal and telecommunications services developed rapidly. 
Total turnover in 1993 of the post and telecommunications 
industry was 9.42 billion yuan, an increase of 65.1 percent over 
1992. The mobile telephone business expanded by 190 percent and 
paging business by 87.2 percent. The number of telephone 
subscribers in urban and rural areas increased by 1.05 million 
in 1993, up 51 percent and accounting for 33.8 percent of total 
telephone users. 
<H5>  5. Domestic Commerce and Prices </H5>
  Domestic consumer goods markets were brisk. Total retail 
sales across society were 140.26 billion yuan, up 32.3 percent 
over the 1992 figure and an increase of 11.9 percent in real 
terms. Retail sale of consumer goods stood at 131.646 billion 
yuan, an increase of 33.8 percent. Of the total 131.646 billion 
yuan, 95.506 billion was consumed in urban areas, an increase of 
40.5 percent, and 36.14 billion in rural areas, up 18.8 percent. 
  Retail sale of food registered mixed results. Sales of eggs 
rose 38.8 percent, sugar 23.7 percent, aquatic products 6.7 
percent, and pork 2.6 percent, while sales of grain and 
vegetable oil declined by 11.4 percent and 17.5 percent 
respectively. Sales of cloth and clothing rose simultaneously, 
the former increasing by 166.1 percent and the latter by 40.3 
percent. Sales of durable consumer goods increased by a big 
margin except for electric fans, whose sales fell a little. 
Sales of color television sets, audio recorders, washing 
machines and refrigerators increased by 38, 45.8, 38.5, and 
36.1 percent respectively. State commercial enterprises greatly 
improved their economic efficiency through transforming their 
managerial mechanisms, and large and medium state enterprises 
increased their vitality. 
  Capital goods markets were brisk. In 1993, materials supply 
and marketing enterprises province wide purchased 58.569 billion 
yuan worth of capital goods, an increase of 31.4 percent on the 
previous year, and their sales totaled 61.052 billion yuan, up 
30.5 percent. Retail sales of capital goods for agricultural use 
in 1993 hit 8.614 billion yuan, an increase of 13 percent over 
the 1992 figure. 
  Price reform deepened. In 1993, apart from adjusting the 
prices of those items specified by the central government, 
Guangdong raised charges for tuition, medical care, public 
services in urban areas, water transport, and electricity, 
giving a bigger role to the needs of the market. Nevertheless, 
affected by excessive social needs and natural disasters, the 
cost of living price index rose by a relatively big margin and 
there was a rather sharp rise in building materials prices and 
service charges.

<H5>  6. Foreign Economic Activity </H5>
  The foreign trade volume increased. According to statistics 
released by customs, Guangdong's 1993 foreign trade volume 
totaled $78.344 billion yuan, representing an increase of 19.2 
percent over the previous year. Of the total foreign trade 
volume, the export volume was $37.394 billion, up 11.8 percent, 
and the import volume was $40.95 billion, up 26.8 percent. The 
mix of import and export commodities was further improved. In 
1993, there was a decrease in the amount of traditional primary 
goods sold abroad and a big increase in the amount of imports of 
badly needed raw and semi-finished materials and 
investment-related equipment. 
  A record amount of foreign funds was used. In 1993, a total 
of 19,012 contracts for using foreign funds were signed 
province-wide, up 47.2 percent over the previous year. A total 
of $34.897 billion of foreign funds was contracted, up 75.7 
percent, while actual funds used amounted to $9.652 billion, up 
98.6 percent. Direct investment by foreign businessmen was 
$7.498 billion, up 110 percent. The area of investment was 
expanded. "Foreign-funded" enterprises grew rapidly. By late 
1993, a total of 44,705 foreign-funded enterprises had been 
registered with the relevant authorities, an increase of 69.6 
percent compared with the same period in the previous year. 
  Economic and technological cooperation with foreign 
countries 
presented good prospects. In 1993, a total of 3,706 contracts 
for labor-service cooperation abroad were signed across the 
province, an increase of 10.9 percent over the 1992 figure. The 
contracts involved $262 million, up 11.5 percent, and a turnover 
of $152 million was effected, up 11.8 percent. However, both 
the number of foreign-contracted projects and the effected 
turnover declined [sentence as published]. 
  In 1993, a total of 32.792 million foreign tourists entered 
China through gateways in Guangdong, up 7 percent over the 
previous year. The number of foreign tourists staying overnight 
in guest houses (hotels) catering only to foreign tourists 
reached 6.1219 million, down 11 percent. 
<H5>  7. Finance and Insurance Business </H5>
  In 1993, the departments responsible for financial affairs 
across the province actively carried out the central 
government's measures for improving macro-economic control in 
bringing the financial market out of chaos and rectifying errors 
which had arisen in financial work. In the meantime, they made 
great efforts to encourage bank deposits and used credit funds 
in a reasonable way to provide sufficient funds for key 
projects, for industrial and agricultural production, for 
purchasing agricultural and sideline products, and for some key 
enterprises to help them solve difficulties caused by the short 
supply of circulating funds while keeping financial markets 
stable. 
  In late 1993, outstanding deposits in state banks 
province-wide hit 34.287 billion yuan, up 14.4 percent, of which 
enterprises outstanding deposits were 97.177 billion yuan, an 
increase of 1.586 billion yuan and 1.7 percent, while residents 
in urban and rural areas accounted for 187.451 billion yuan, an 
increase of 41.45 billion yuan and 28.4 percent. Outstanding 
loans granted by banks province-wide totaled 223.734 billion 
yuan, representing an increase of 42.346 billion yuan and 23.4 
percent, of which outstanding revolving credit funds accounted 
for 169.889 billion yuan, up 20.2 percent, and outstanding loans 
for fixed assets accounted for 29.713 billion yuan, up 26 
percent. If the money supply was deducted from that which was 
withdrawn, net money supply in 1993 was 23.58 billion yuan, 
14.425 billion yuan more than in 1992. 
  The insurance business grew at a greater pace. In 1993, 
total underwriting assets amounted to 953.105 billion yuan, an 
increase of 58.8 percent over the previous year. Insurance 
companies province-wide handled a total of 279,400 claims for 
insured assets at home and abroad, paying out a total of 3.293 
billion yuan in damages. In addition, insurance companies paid 
174 million yuan in damages to 192,900 persons. 
<H5>  8. Science and Technology </H5>
  Continued progress was made in science and technology. In 
1993, a total of 185 scientific and technological achievements 
received state and provincial-level awards; of the total, two 
received state invention awards, 15 state scientific and 
technological progress awards, five state "Spark" awards, 129 
provincial scientific and technological awards, 19 provincial 
natural science awards, and 15 provincial "spark" awards. A 
total of 5,020 patent applications were received and 4,546 were 
granted, increases of 7.8 and 170 percent respectively over the 
previous year. Hi-tech industry made bigger progress. By late 
1993, a total of six state-level and three provincial-level 
development zones for industries using high and new technology 
and a hi-tech industrial corridor had been set up across the 
province. A total of 166 enterprises using high and new 
technology and a total of 770 hi-tech products were confirmed as 
reaching relevant standards. 
  The ranks of scientists and technological workers grew and 
more funds were injected into scientific research. In 1993, 
natural and social science and technology personnel working with 
state enterprises and institutions totaled 727,300 (excluding 
personnel from central units stationed in Guangdong), an 
increase of 9.3 percent over the previous year. State 
independent research and development offices totaled 505, while 
scientific research institutes run by colleges and universities 
and large and medium industrial enterprises totaled 362 and 773 
respectively. Scientific and technology people totaled 75,200. 
Expenditure in 1993 on scientific and technological activities 
was 2.168 billion yuan, up 14.7 percent over the previous year. 
  In 1993, there were 50 product quality control offices 
across 
the province. A total of 37 enterprises applied international 
norms to 44 items. Mapping departments drew 3,970 maps of 
various proportions and published 108 commercial maps and books. 
A total of 46 ultra-short-wave weather forecast stations were 
set up across the province. Departments engaged in seismology 
and oceanography research improved their service. 
  Technological markets were brisk. A total of 7,605 
contracts were signed in 1993, involving 1.043 billion yuan, up 
8.5 and 63.2 percent respectively over the previous year. Many 
people showed keen interest in scientific research. Workers 
technological associations across the province solved 4,021 key 
technological problems in production in 1993. 
<H5>  9. Education, Culture, Public Health, Sports </H5>
  The scale of higher education was expanded. In 1993, a total 
of 1,551 research students were recruited province-wide, an 
increase of 21.7 percent over the previous year figure, and the 
number of research students receiving education was 3,983, up 
13.2 percent. Universities and colleges enrolled 47,600 students 
in 1993, up 34.1 percent, and had 117,000 students, up 20.1 
percent. 
  Secondary vocational and technical education continued to 
grow. All types of secondary vocational and technical schools 
had 415,000 students (of which 76,800 were studying in technical 
schools), accounting for 55.6 percent of the total number of 
senior middle school students, an increase of 2.5 percentage 
points over the previous year. 
  More people received compulsory education. In 1993, junior 
middle schools province-wide had 2.4404 million students and 
primary schools 8.3214 million. "Project Hope" made progress 
day by day. The attendance ratio of primary school age 
population reached 99.5 percent, the proportion of primary 
school students entering junior middle schools rose to 88.4 
percent from 86.5 percent in the previous year, and the 
percentage of middle and primary school students discontinuing 
their studies declined. A total of 58 counties (cities, and 
districts) made nine-year compulsory education universal. 
  More adults were admitted to schools. High schools for 
adults had 125,200 students, an increase of 65.4 percent over 
the previous year's figure; secondary special or technical 
schools for adults had 164,300, up 21.7 percent; and middle and 
primary schools for adults 617,400. A total of 39,600 young and 
middle-aged illiterates learned to read and write. 
  Cultural undertakings developed each day. By late 1993, 
there were 125 artistic troupes, 112 cultural centers, 112 
public libraries, 108 museums, and 155 archives in the province. 
In addition, there were 94 radio stations including 12 
medium-wave broadcast transmitting stations and relay stations, 
and 43 television stations, including 28 television transmitting 
stations and relay stations. There were 3,680 film projection 
teams. A total of seven feature films were produced, and 186 
new films (long ones) of all types were distributed. There were 
2.082 billion copies, 208 million volumes, and 348 million 
volumes of newspapers, magazines, and books published 
respectively. Control over cultural markets was strengthened. 
  Steady progress was made in public health. By late 1993, 
hospitals province-wide had 129,300 beds, an increase of 3.6 
percent. Professional health workers totaled 211,900, up 3.3

townships and towns. The hospitals had 36,700 beds and 53,100 
health workers in 1993, up 4.9 and 3.1 percent respectively. 
  Relatively good results were scored in sports. Our athletes 
broke 10 world records, six Asian records, and 42 national 
records, and won 19 world, 39 Asian, and 42 national 
championships. At the Seventh National Games, our athletes 
obtained 31 gold medals and the same number of silver medals 
with the numbers of gold medals and medals and total scores 
ranking second respectively among other provinces and autonomous 
regions. Mass sports activities developed vigorously. A total 
of 9,865 sports meets were held across the province with 1.85 
million people participating in them. 
<H5>  10. Population and People's Lives </H5>
  A sample investigation in 1993 into population changes in 
the 
province showed that the birth rate was 18.34 per thousand, the 
death rate 5.84 per thousand, and the natural growth rate was 
12.5 per thousand. In late 1993, the number of regular 
residents was 65.82 million and the domiciled population was 
66.07 million. 
  Residents' income increased steadily. According to sample 
investigations, in 1993 the average amount of per-capita income 
used for living expenses was 4,277 yuan, up 34.3 percent over 
the previous year and showing an increase of 10.1 percent in 
real terms. The per-capita net income in rural areas was 1,675 
yuan, up 28.1 percent over the 1992 figure and an increase of

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Guangxi Regional Statistics Bureau </F>
on 20 February 1994: "Statistical Report Issued by Guangxi 
Regional Statistics Bureau on National Economic and Social 
Development in 1993"] 
  [Text] In 1993, under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and of the policies set out by the 14th party 
congress, all nationalities in Guangxi further emancipated their 
minds; seized the opportunity to accelerate the pace of reform, 
opening up, and economic construction; and conscientiously 
implemented various macroscopic measures formulated by the 
central authorities. On the basis of the previous year's 
high-speed growth, the regional national economy continued to 
develop in a healthy way while achieving political stability, 
unity of nationalities, and social progress. Moreover, new 
development was seen in various social undertakings, including 
the fields of economy, science and technology, education, 
culture, public health, and sports. Preliminary statistics 
indicated that the total value of GDP for the whole year was 
77.3 billion yuan, up 19.6 percent over the previous year. Of 
this total, the value added by primary industry was 26.078 
billion yuan, up 6.7 percent over the previous year; that of 
secondary industry hit 30.348 billion yuan, up 39.4 percent; and 
that of tertiary industry amounted to 20.839 billion yuan, up 
14.3 percent. The major problems that remained in economic 
performance were: shortage of funds, insufficient investment in 
agriculture, slow growth of peasants' real income, sluggish 
development of the communications and energy sectors, large 
increases in market prices, as well as poor efficiency and 
operational difficulties on the part of certain enterprises. 
<H5>  I. Agriculture </H5>
  In 1993, governments at all levels in our region 
conscientiously implemented the guidelines laid down by the 
central rural work meeting; enhanced leadership over 
agricultural production; fully engaged in the comprehensive 
development of agriculture; vigorously readjusted and optimized 
the internal structure of agriculture; vigorously popularized 
advanced agricultural technology; and took the path of high 
yields, fine quality, and high efficiency, thus achieving 
overall growth in agricultural production. Preliminary 
statistics indicated that the value added by the agricultural 
sector was 26.078 billion yuan, up 6.7 percent over the previous 
year, of which the planting industry, forestry, animal 
husbandry, and fisheries increased 1.7, 2.2, 17.4, and 24.7 
percent respectively. However, a number of outstanding problems 
remained, such as the relatively low economic benefit of 
agriculture, the slow growth of peasants' real income, the price 
scissors in the exchange of industrial products for agricultural 
products, and the ever-widening gap between incomes earned by 
urban and rural dwellers. 
  The planting industry developed in the midst of 
readjustment. 
As far as major farm produce was concerned, apart from a slight 
decrease in sugar cane yield due to a reduction in the growing 
area as compared with that of the previous year, grain yield was 
14.95 million tonnes, up 2.6 percent over the previous year, 
which once again hit historic highs. Moreover, an all-round 
bumper harvest was reaped in the yields of grain, soybeans, 
potatoes and the like, oil-bearing crops, tobacco, tea, and 
fruit. In addition, such crops as winter vegetables also 
achieved new development.

  New progress was made in forestry. The newly afforested area 
in 1993 covered 786,000 hectares (11.788 million mu), up 15.9 
percent over the previous year. The output of rosin reached 
245,000 tonnes, up 19.1 percent, and the output of tung tree 
seed reached 46,000 tonnes, up 2.1 percent, whereas the output 
of rapeseed was 66,000 tonnes, down 14.1 percent. 
  Huge growth was registered in animal husbandry and 
fisheries. 
Apart from steadily developing the production of pigs, various 
localities paid increasing attention to the production of 
grazing stock, poultry, and aquatic products, hence there were 
more pigs, oxen, sheep, and goats reared and slaughtered, making 
for tremendous growth in the total output of meat and aquatic 
products as compared with the previous year. The output of 
major products was as follows:

  Further improvement was made in conditions for agricultural 
production. By the end of 1993, the aggregate power of farm 
machinery reached 93.91 billion Watts, a growth of 9.9 percent 
over the previous year-end figure. There were 12,400 large and 
medium-sized tractors, a drop of 2.4 percent; 19,500 trucks, up 
17.5 percent; irrigation and drainage equipment with a total 
power capacity of 930 million Watts, up 5.6 percent; and 1.4969 
million hectares with effective irrigation systems, a drop of 
1.1 percent. Moreover, a total of 1.0544 million tonnes of 
chemical fertilizers (100 percent effective content equivalent) 
were applied, registering an increase of 1.9 percent. Rural 
consumption of electricity was 1.898 billion kwh, up 11.8 
percent. 
  The rural economy continued to develop in a comprehensive 
way, and such nonagricultural economic sectors as rural 
industry, construction, transportation, trade, and catering grew 
by more than 100 percent over the previous year. Spurred by 
many positive factors, town and township enterprises maintained 
a trend of high-speed development, with the total income for the 
whole year reaching 73.569 billion yuan, up 140 percent over the 
previous year. The total amount of profits and taxes were 6.34 
billion yuan, up 110 percent over the previous year, of which 
4.457 billion yuan was the net profit and 1.883 billion yuan of 
state taxes were actually turned in, up 130 percent and 80.5 
percent, respectively, over the same period of the previous year. 
<H5>  II. Industry and Construction </H5>
  In 1993, reform of industrial enterprises was deepened and 
the enthusiasm of enterprises and their staff and workers was 
effectively aroused. Driven by a huge growth in demand for 
investment, industrial enterprises continued to maintain 
high-speed growth. The value added by industry for the whole 
year amounted to 26.255 billion yuan, up 40.5 percent over the 
previous year, and the proportion of the value added by industry 
to the total value of GDP rose from the previous year's 28.8 
percent to 33.9 percent. Regarding the value added by industry 
at and above the township level, which was calculated 
independently, that by state-owned enterprises was 1.598 billion 
yuan, up 33.6 percent, with the gradual enhancement of the 
market mechanism and the rapid development of non-state-owned 
enterprises, that by collective enterprises amounted to 3.61 
billion yuan, up 41.5 percent, and that by other economic types 
of enterprises (including foreign-funded enterprises) was 4.17 
billion yuan, up 47.7 percent. There are better links between 
production and marketing of industrial products, and the 
production-marketing rate of these products at and above the 
township level for the whole year reached 96.9 percent. 
  The growth of heavy industry is obviously faster than that 
of 
light industry, the proportion of the former to the latter rose, 
and the industrial structure was further readjusted. The value 
added by light industry at and above the township level, which 
was calculated independently, was 8.235 billion yuan, up 38.3 
percent over the previous year, and that by heavy industry was 
12.009 billion yuan, up 39.7 percent. Owing to the effect of 
greater demand for investment, there is, in general, huge growth 
in the output of capital goods, whereas the output of some of 
the unsalable goods dropped.

  In 1993, the economic results of industry were improved; the 
comprehensive industrial enterprise index at and above the 
township level, which was calculated independently, was 110.76; 
the sales rate of industrial products reached 96.9 percent; the 
profit and tax rate of funds was 14.8 percent; the cost-profit 
margin was 6.5 percent; circulating funds turned over 1.86 
times; the value-added rate of industry was 29.2 percent; and 
the overall labor productivity (calculated on the basis of the 
valued added) was 18,175 yuan. Cane sugar is one of the 
economic pillars of our region. In the 1992-93 sugar-pressing 
season, the region's cane sugar output rose, achieving first 
place in the country. Reversing the unmarketable situation in 
the previous year, sugar sold well and the whole industry turned 
deficits into profits and brought about tremendous growth in 
profits and taxes, thus playing an important role in improving 
our region's industrial results. However, some enterprises 
still were plagued by poor economic results and countless 
operational difficulties. 
  The construction industry continued to develop rapidly. In 
1993, the value added by this sector totalled 4.093 billion 
yuan, up 32.1 percent over the previous year. The completed 
floor space of buildings was 2.358 million square meters, up 4.2 
percent; overall labor productivity grew 56.1 percent over the 
previous year; and the quality of buildings also improved. 
  III. Fixed-Asset Investment 
  The pace of constructing a passage to the sea in the 
southwest was accelerated, and greater fixed-asset investment 
was made. In 1993, completed fixed-asset investment was 22.125 
billion yuan, up 56.9 percent over the previous year. The 
investment and the extent of growth in fixed assets last year 
was the largest since the policy of reform and opening up was 
implemented. Of this, the investment of state-owned units was 
17.14 billion yuan, representing an increase of 110 percent; 
that of collective units was 1.756 billion yuan, up 13.0 
percent; and individual investment was 3.255 billion yuan, which 
was more or less the same as the previous year. There were 
3,196 new projects started by state-owned units, 760 fewer than 
the previous year, accounting for 48.8 percent of the total 
number of projects under construction. Six of these were newly 
started large and medium-sized projects, three fewer than the 
previous year. 
  The investment in capital construction projects by 
state-owned units was 10.389 billion yuan, up 120 percent over 
the previous year; that in technical innovation and 
transformation projects was 4.723 billion yuan, up 61.6 percent; 
that in the construction of commodity houses was 1.72 billion 
yuan, up 300 percent; and that in others was 284 million yuan, 
up 79.9 percent. 
  There was tremendous growth and greater proportion of 
investment in tertiary industry, with the focus on key 
construction projects. Major progress was achieved in 
constructing the great passage to the sea in the southwest, and 
the growth of investment in tertiary industry -- such as 
communications and transportation -- was conspicuous. 
Investment by state-owned units in primary industry was 353 
million yuan, up 14.1 percent over the previous year, and its 
overall share dropped from the previous year's 53.3 percent to 
45.5 percent. Of this, investment in the energy industry was 
1.690 billion yuan, up 46.4 percent, and its overall share 
dropped from 14.0 percent to 9.9 percent; that in the raw and 
processed materials industry was 2.770 billion yuan, up 100 
percent, and its overall share rose from 16.2 percent to 16.5 
percent; whereas not much growth was registered in investment in 
the machinery, as well as light and textile industries, with 
their proportions falling by dropped 0.3 percent and 2.5 
percent, respectively. Investment in tertiary industry was 8.97 
billion yuan, up 150 percent over the previous year, and its 
overall share rose from the previous year's 43.0 percent to 52.4 
percent, of which investment in communications and 
transportation, as well as post and telecommunications services, 
was 2.986 billion yuan, up 150 percent over the previous year, 
and their overall share rose from 14.2 percent to 17.4 percent. 
  The pace of constructing key projects was accelerated. A 
total of 5.347 billion yuan of investment in 34 key projects 
throughout the region was completed, up 61.7 percent over the 
previous year. The 400 km-long second-grade highway between 
Nanning and Wuzhou was completed and opened to traffic on 18 
October; two no. 2 generating sets at the Yantan and 
Tianshengqiao hydropower stations were completed and put into 
operation in August and September, respectively; and the no. 3 
generating set of the power station in the shipping center of 
Guiping officially started generating power as early as in 
February. Moreover, smooth progress was made in a number of key 
construction projects, namely, the Qinzhou-Beihai Railway, the 
Guilin Liangjiang International Airport, the airports in Liuzhou 
and Wuzhou, the Guangxi Pingguo Aluminum Company, the Zhaoping 
hydropower station, and the Hexian County pulp mill in Wuzhou. 
  The major productivity (or efficiency) newly added by 
capital 
construction and transformation projects throughout the region 
was: 563,000 kw of generating capacity; 16,000 tonnes of 
machine-made paper and paperboard per year; 2.70 million tonnes 
of port handling capacity; and 2,000 km of optical fiber cables 
for long-distance communications. 
  IV. Communications, Posts and Telecommunications 
  Communications and transportation, as well as post and 
telecommunications services, registered faster growth. In 1993, 
a total of 4.633 billion yuan of added value was completed by 
these sectors, up 20.1 percent over the previous year. However, 
the fact that the development of communications and 
transportation lagged behind economic development remained an 
outstanding problem. In particular, there was a wide gap 
between supply and demand in railway transportation, and the 
potential of highway transportation had not been brought into 
full play. 
  The volume of passenger and freight transport in the 
communications sector was as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Post and telecommunications services developed rapidly, with 
business transactions in 1993 totalling 780 million yuan, up 
69.81 percent over the previous year. Express mail service, 
paging, and mobile telephone service rose rapidly in various 
prefectures, cities, and counties. By the end of 1993, the 
number of urban telephone subscribers had reached 240,000, up 
52.7 percent over the previous year. Manual phones were no 
longer used in areas above the county and city levels throughout 
the region, and the process of urban telephone automation was 
completed, thus achieving the construction goal of the Eighth 
Five-Year Plan two years ahead of schedule. However, the 
communications capacity still could not meet the needs of social 
and economic development. In particular, communications in vast 
rural areas still were not smooth. 
<H5>  V. Domestic Trade and Market Prices </H5>
  The domestic market developed steadily, and institutional 
consumption was checked. With further acceleration in the pace 
of reform in circulation, the domestic market was flourishing, 
with brisk buying and selling, and there was an abundant supply 
of consumer goods. The total value of retail commodity sales 
was 34.276 billion yuan, up 25.2 percent over the previous year, 
or a real growth of 5.26 percent if price increases are 
deducted. Retail sales of consumer goods were 30.503 billion 
yuan, up 29.7 percent, and sales of means of production reached 
3.773 billion yuan, down 2.7 percent. Retail sales of consumer 
goods at urban markets were 13.881 billion yuan, up 43.1 percent 
over the previous year; sales in counties and cities were 7.606 
billion yuan, up 25.8 percent; and sales in villages were 9.016 
billion yuan, up 16.1 percent. In the latter half of 1993, 
owing to the implementation of state macroeconomic regulative 
measures, the growth rate of social institutional consumption 
apparently dropped. In 1993, retail sales of consumer goods 
sold to social institutions throughout the region were 1.857 
billion yuan, up 23.3 percent over the previous year, and the 
growth rate in the latter half of the year decreased by 13 
percent compared with the first half. 
  An overall increase was registered in retail sales of 
commodities by commercial units of all economic forms. Retail 
sales by state-owned units were 13.211 billion yuan, up 25.7 
percent over the previous year; sales by collective units were 
7.144 billion yuan, up 10.6 percent; and sales by supply and 
marketing cooperatives were 60 million yuan, up 29 percent; 
whereas the economy of individual units developed rapidly and 
their retail sales reached 1.0272 billion yuan, up 33.9 percent, 
which was the largest growth rate among all economic forms. 
Sales by peasants to nonagricultural residents were 3.590 
billion yuan, up 32.96 percent. Analyzed by the retail sales of 
all kinds of consumer goods, due to the effect of lifting 
restrictions on purchasing and selling prices of grain, retail 
sales of grain, pigs, and pork dropped slightly, whereas sales 
of other items rose to different degrees, of which the sales of 
edible vegetable oil increased 17.3 percent, sales of eggs 
increased 8.26 percent, sales of sugar increased 32.9 percent; 
most clothing items registered a growth, and the sales of cotton 
cloth and other garments increased 18.5 percent and 18.1 
percent, respectively. There was tremendous growth in sales of 
major consumer durables, of which sales of video recorders rose 
80.3 percent, sales of color TV sets rose 15.2 percent, sales of 
washing machines rose 53.1 percent, and sales of electric fans 
and household refrigerators increased by 33.0 percent and 20.2 
percent, respectively. 
  There was brisk buying and selling in the market for means 
of 
production. In 1993, the total purchase of means of production 
by material supply and marketing enterprises was 14.94 billion 
yuan, up 48.1 percent over the previous year, and the total 
amount of sales reached 15.24 billion yuan, up 42.3 percent. 
  The pace of price reform was accelerated, the market was 
more 
open, and the increase in commodity prices was quite high. Of 
the total volume of retail commodity sales throughout the 
region, commodities priced by the state accounted for only 5.4 
percent, the total amount of farm produce purchased accounted 
for merely 1.5 percent, and the total sales of industrial means 
of production accounted for 7.4 percent. In 1993, apart from 
relaxing restrictions on the purchasing and selling prices of 
grain, some commodity prices and service charges also were 
readjusted, thus bringing about a rise in price indices related 
to residents' cost of living. Consequently, there was quite a 
large rise in the general level of retail prices and of 
residents' cost of living. 
  The changes in prices in 1993, as compared with prices in 
the previous year, were as follows (the previous year's figures 
given as 100):

<H5>  VI. Foreign Economic Relations </H5>
  The pace of opening up to the outside world was further 
accelerated and a new breakthrough was made in the utilization 
of foreign capital. In 1993, our region enthusiastically 
improved the hardware and software environment for investment 
and seized the favorable opportunity to successfully hold two 
trade fairs in Hong Kong, thus vigorously promoting the 
development of foreign economic relations and trade throughout 
the region. 
  Total trade volume in 1993 amounted to $2.051 billion, up 
26.3 percent over the previous year, of which the volume of 
exports was $1.325 billion, up 19.6 percent, whereas the volume 
of imports was $726 million, up 39.4 percent. Tremendous growth 
was registered in the volume of enterprise exports, with exports 
for the whole year reaching $145 million, up 31.8 percent over 
the previous year, and their share in the total volume of 
foreign trade throughout the region rose from 9.9 percent in the 
previous year to 10.9 percent. Total border trade volume was 
2.87 billion yuan, down 10.1 percent over the previous year. 
  Utilization of foreign capital increased by 100 percent. A 
total of 2,478 new agreements for utilization of foreign capital 
were signed in 1993, which was 1,140 more than signed in the 
previous year. The amount of foreign capital contracted reached 
$3.814 billion, up 163 percent, and a total of $924 million was 
actually utilized, registering an increase of 304 percent, of 
which $872 million was invested directly by foreign businessmen, 
registering growth of 380 percent -- one of the largest among 
the 12 coastal provinces and regions in the country. New 
progress was achieved in economic and technological cooperation 
inside and outside the region. In 1993, 24 construction 
projects and labor projects contracted by our region were signed 
with the outside, and the contracted amount was $109 million, up 
120 percent over the previous year. A total of 2,200 
cooperation projects were implemented, and a total of 3.8 
billion yuan of capital introduced from areas outside the region 
was available, registering an increase of 120 percent over the 
previous year. 
  As far as international tourism was concerned, the number of 
tourists received in 1993 decreased slightly. A total of 
510,920 foreigners; overseas Chinese; and compatriots from Hong 
Kong, Macao, and Taiwan; who came to Guangxi for sightseeing, 
visits, or other activities were received in 1993, down 13.4 
percent from the previous year. Income from tourism amounted to 
505 million yuan (in Foreign Exchange Certificates), down 8.4 
percent from the previous year. Since the field of operations 
was broadened and new scenic spots for tourism added, a large 
number of overseas tourists still find it attractive to visit 
our region, and we should continue to be optimistic about our 
tourism. 
<H5>  VII. Science, Education, Culture, Public Health, and Sports </H5>
  New results were scored in scientific and technological 
research and in the popularization of scientific and 
technological achievements. A total of 480 scientific and 
technological achievements were registered at and above the 
provincial and departmental levels throughout the region, of 
which 24 were internationally advanced achievements, 29 were 
pioneer works in the country, 283 were domestically advanced 
achievements, 96 were leading works in the region, 48 were 
advanced ones in the region, three were granted state awards for 
progress in science and technology, two were granted state Spark 
Awards, 186 were granted autonomous regional awards for progress 
in science and technology, and 14 were granted the autonomous 
regional Spark Awards. In 1993, a total of 5,477 patent 
applications were handled and 2,505 patents were approved. The 
market for the transfer of technology expanded further. There 
were 632 technological and trade institutions in our region 
which signed a total of 579 technological contracts in 1993, 
with the transaction amount reaching 50.669 million yuan. Key 
scientific and technological achievements scored throughout our 
region in 1993 were: Research into resection of the larynx in 
glottal cancer suffers and the reconstruction of the epiglottis; 
experimental research conducted in tree shrews for the study of 
the relationship between the Hepatitis B virus and aflatoxin in 
human bodies and the incidence of primary liver cancer; research 
into a graphic multimedia system called GBH [expansion unknown]; 
research into the cyclical movement of two-dimensional flows; 
research into Hercules' mixture [da li shen 1129 0500 4377]; and 
so on. Remarkable economic and social benefit was brought about 
by popularizing the application of some of these achievements. 
  Development zones developed steadily in the process of 
rectifying the economic order and improving the economic 
environment. In 1993, there were 18 development zones 
throughout the region, of which five were at the state level, 
while 13 were at the regional level. In addition, the 
establishment of seven development zones has not been approved 
yet. A total of 215 scientific and technological enterprises, 
which realized 797 million yuan of output value and 66.70 
million yuan of profits and taxes, have been initiated in the 
three new- and high-technology development zones in Nanning, 
Guilin, and Liuzhou. 
  Changes in the contingent of scientific and technical 
personnel were brought about by the market economy. By the end 
of 1993, state-owned units had a total of 661,200 professional 
technical personnel, registering a decrease by 7,800 from the 
previous year. 
  Further development was achieved in educational undertakings 
in the midst of reform. In 1993, a total of 248 students were 
enrolled in postgraduate courses, up 72.2 percent over the 
previous year. Institutions of higher learning took in 19,514 
new undergraduate students, up 20.6 percent, whereas secondary 
vocational and technical education developed rapidly. By the 
end of 1993, there were 352,800 students studying in various 
types of secondary vocational and technical schools (including 
45,900 students in technical worker training schools), up 190 
percent over the previous year. By the end of 1993, there were 
1.4413 million students in junior secondary schools and 6.1077 
million pupils in primary schools, up 5.4 and 2.7 percent over 
the previous year, respectively. The enrollment rate of primary 
school-age children (7-11 years of age) was 97.9 percent, 97.9 
percent of primary students did not drop out, and their rate of 
continuing studies at the secondary level rose from the previous 
year's 67.1 percent to 70.2 percent. 
  Cultural undertakings continued to develop in a healthy 
manner. By the end of 1993, there were 115 art performing 
groups; 99 libraries; 96 cultural centers; 35 museums; 4,433 
film-projection units, with 690,300 film shows and 214 million 
moviegoers; six newly produced feature films; 13 television 
stations; and 14 radio stations. In 1993, 46.75 million copies 
of newspapers, 42.66 million copies of magazines, and 31.53 
copies of 34,000 types of books were issued. 
  Public health undertakings and medical facilities further 
improved. By the end of 1993, there were 76,000 hospital beds 
in our region, up 2,700 beds or 3.7 percent over the previous 
year. There were 110,700 full-time health workers, down 2 
percent from the previous year; of whom 51,600 were doctors 
(including 39,200 senior doctors of traditional Chinese medicine 
and of Western medicine), up 3 percent; and 33,700 nurses, up 
2.1 percent. 
  New results were achieved in sports undertakings. Athletes 
of our region won 65 gold, silver, and bronze medals in the 
National Sports Meet; won eight gold medals, two silver medals, 
and three bronze medals in major international competitions; 
broke eight Asian records; and broke 15 national records. 
<H5>  VIII. Population and People's Life </H5>
  The pace of population growth was brought under control. 
According to a sample survey of population changes, the crude 
birth rate of the population was 19.6 per thousand, and the 
crude death rate was 6.4 per thousand, resulting in a natural 
growth rate of 13.2 per thousand or 0.3 percent higher than the 
figure for the previous year, but still within the limits of the 
planned target. It is estimated that the total population of our 
region was 44.38 million by the end of 1993, or an increase of 
580,000 over the figure at the end of 1992. 
  The income of residents continued to increase and their 
living conditions further improved. Data from a sample survey 
showed that the annual per capita income of urban residents that 
could be used as living expenses was 2,611 yuan in 1993, up 38.5 
percent over the previous year, or a real growth of 12.3 percent 
allowing for price rises. The per capita net income of peasants 
was 885 yuan, up 20.9 percent over the previous year, or a real 
growth of 4.3 percent, allowing for price rises. However, the 
gap in the income level between urban and rural areas widened 
and rose from 1:2.6 (peasants' income as 1) to 1:3; the living 
standard of workers and staff in some enterprises operating in 
the red declined; and peasants in poverty-stricken were still in 
straitened circumstances. 
  The employment service system and the social security system 
for retirees was gradually perfected. A total of 172,000 people 
were given jobs in cities and towns in 1993, and the urban 
unemployment rate was 3 percent by the end of the year, down 0.3 
percent from the previous year and lower than the annual 
controlled target. There was wider social insurance coverage of 
workers and staff in urban enterprises. A total of 1.425 
million workers and staff and 256,000 retirees have joined 
comprehensive social insurance programs. Moreover, the mechanism 
of enterprises' hiring workers was further perfected and the 
number of workers and staff grew more slowly than before. By 
the end of 1993, workers and staff in our region numbered 3.364 
million, up 0.7 percent over the previous year, of whom workers 
and staff of staff-owned units were 2.809 million, up 1.4 
percent, whereas individual workers in cities and towns were 
366,000, up 11.2 percent. 
  Workers and staff earned more real income and residents had 
a 
stronger sense of financial investment. In 1993, the total wage 
bill of workers and staff was 1.061 billion yuan, up 25.8 
percent over the end of 1992. The average monetary wage of 
workers and staff was 3,202 yuan, up 23.6 percent over the 
previous year, or a real increase of 0.2 percent allowing for 
price rises. With the gradual improvement of residents' living 
conditions, more and more residents made financial investments. 
Statistics showed that in 1993, there were approximately 10,000 
stock-purchasers throughout our region, and more and more 
residents purchased stocks, bonds, and other kinds of negotiable 
securities. 
  The insurance sector played a greater role in economic 
construction. Insurance premiums in 1993 totalled 146.65 
billion yuan, up 20.2 percent over the previous year, of which 
premiums for property insurance were 116.6 billion yuan. A 
total of 13,532 enterprises participated in enterprise property 
insurance programs, 4.5554 million households participated in 
household property insurance programs, and 11.53 million people 
participated in life insurance programs of various kinds. 
Insurance companies took 148,800 cases of claims for loss of 
property, and paid indemnities of 371 million yuan for settled 
cases. Another 371 million yuan was paid to 394,800 people as 
reparations in life insurance programs. 
  Urban and rural living conditions further improved. In 1993, 
a total of 2.77 million square meters of new residential 
buildings were completed in urban areas and 12.31 million square 
meters of new houses were built in rural areas. 
  Social welfare undertakings continued to develop. In 1993, 
there were 7,976 beds in social welfare institutions of various 
types in our region, with 5,636 occupants. A total of 4.693 
million people in need received various types of relief funds in 
urban and rural areas.
