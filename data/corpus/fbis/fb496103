  [Text] Guangzhou, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Guangdong Province in 
south China has taken a big stride in improving the management 
of its ports in a bid to bring it into line with common 
international practices. 
  The province has since 1978 spent some five billion yuan 
(about 574.7 million U.S. dollars) constructing ports, according 
to Chen Xueqin, director of the provincial office of the customs 
department. 
  There were 196 land, sea and air ports in Guangdong Province 
by the end of 1993, mostly in the special economic zones, 
coastal open cities and other economically developed areas. 
  The ports handled 83.6 million incoming and outgoing 
passengers and 111.5 million tons of import and export goods in 
1993, 21.3 times and 9.3 times more than in 1978. 
  The province has simplified customs procedures and cut 
unnecessary inspections and checks to make entry and exit easier. 
  The land port in Shenzhen introduced the practice of 
concentrated check of freight vehicles, unified collection of 
fees and unified customs declaration in order to reduce the 
number of stops for inspection. The practice has been 
introduced to all ports in the province starting from March 1. 
  In handling passengers, the border checking posts introduced 
computer visa checks and random checks. Harbor supervision 
departments have also changed the method of issuing certificates 
to incoming and outgoing ships and prolonged the validity period 
of visas. Transit passengers at the Shenzhen airport are free 
from going through customs and border check procedures. 
  The province has also removed the way checking station at 
Dachan Island for small ships of less than 500 tons shuttling in 
the area of Hong Kong and Macao and they are required to go 
through outgoing procedures at the starting ports.

  [Text] Nanjing, June 29 (XINHUA) -- The scenic city of 
Suzhou, in east China's Jiangsu Province, is trying hard to 
strengthen environmental protection while vigorously developing 
the local economy. 
  Local officials said that the city has relocated about 100 
factories or workshops from the old city proper, in combination 
with the adjustment of the economic structure and technological 
upgrading of enterprises. 
  It has completed pollution treatment for 134 projects in the 
city, and built or extended three sewage treatment plants. 
  The city has delineated zones where smoke, dust and fixed 
noise sources have been brought under strict control. 
  As rural industry has been developing fast, great 
improvement 
has also been made in environmental protection of the city's 
suburbs. 
  Surveys show that the quality of drinking water sources for 
rural residents of the city has met government-set requirements. 
The quality of air over the city have also met government 
standards. 
  The city has worked out over 30 sets of local environment 
protection rules and regulations, covering air, dust, noise, the 
treatment of pollutant discharges and supervision and management. 
  Right in Suzhou, construction of a 70 sq km modern 
industrial 
park, a joint development project between China and Singapore, 
is being carried out. 
  The city has adopted policies to further strengthen 
treatment 
of the environment in the planned industrial park and in 
adjacent areas, to meet standards in developed countries, the 
officials said. 
  For instance, the Suzhou Sulphuric Acid Factory, which used 
to be located close to the northern side of the park, was asked 
to stop production and the site has become a heat and power 
plant to supply the industrial park. 
  Besides changing the course of a sewage canal to avoid 
sewage 
from Suzhou city going to the industrial park, the city has also 
extended its sewage treatment plant in the eastern part of the 
city to take more sewage from the industrial park.

  [Text] Malaysia has called on the world community to exert 
its influence to have economic sanctions against Iraq lifted 
soon. Minister of Youth and Sports Haji Abdul Ghani Othman said 
Malaysia feels that the people of Iraq have suffered enough. 
Malaysia supports the lifting of economic sanctions currently 
imposed upon Iraq due to the humanitarian situation which is 
deteriorating and will endanger the life of its people. He said 
this in a speech when opening the International Conference 
Against Economic Sanctions on Iraq in Kuala Lumpur. Haji Abdul 
Ghani criticized the UN for its incapability, saying that as an 
international body, the UN was slow and was even seeming to be 
practicing double standards in responding to the needs of the 
oppressed.

  [Excerpts] The controversial Asia-Pacific Conference on 
East Timor [APCET] pushed through earlier this afternoon at the 
University of the Philippines-Diliman. Twenty-seven foreign 
delegates attended the conference in spite of the ban. They 
marched into Malcolm Hall, chanting Liberate East Timor from 
Indonesia. 
  This conference has been a big issue since Malacanang banned 
the attendance of known East Timor supporters and after a judge 
issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the conference 
from opening. 
  The Supreme Court, however, decided in favor of the 
organizers of the conference. Although APCET Chairman Renato 
Constantino Jr. was happy about the Supreme Court decision, he 
is saddened by the continued ban on foreign delegates. 
  [Begin Constantino recording in progress, in English] ...to 
risk losing it, to keep it. The crisis was caused by the 
arrogant acts of the Indonesian Government and its provincial 
directorate in village Malacanang. 
  We have asserted our rights, the Supreme Court has upheld 
them. But let us not forget that the irrational presidential ban 
on foreign participants remain. [end recording] 
  Within four days, the conference will tackle Indonesia's 
alleged violation of East Timor's human rights, as thousands 
have died since Indonesian troops annexed East Timor. [passage 
omitted] 
  Meanwhile, Malacanang said the ban on 27 foreigners will 
continue. 
  National Security adviser Jose Almonte said they will 
closely 
monitor the foreigners who have already entered the country, 
especially their statements during the conference. If they make 
statements detrimental to the national interest, they may be 
requested to leave the country, if not forbidden to attend the 
conference. 
  Earlier today, the Immigration Bureau canceled the visas of 
10 foreigners. They were Max Lane, Pedro Pinto Leit, Saslia 
Koonumberg, Robert Smith, Chopra Shambu, Peter Wesley Smith, 
Luisa Ferreira, Sharon Scharse, Charles Scheiner, and Marcelo 
Ferreira. Immigration Associate Commissioner Manuel Roxas said 
the subject foreigners will be arrested and deported. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] MANILA, May 29 (AFP) - French First Lady Danielle 
Mitterrand is named on a list of foreigners banned by the 
Philippines from entering the country to attend a conference on 
human rights in East Timor. 
  Officials are under orders to refuse entry to anyone of the 
36 peopled named on the list, a copy of which was seen here. 
  Mitterrand had accepted an invitation to attend the Asia 
Pacific Conference on East Timor (APCET) to be held from Tuesday 
to Friday, but later said she would not be coming, although no 
reason was given for the change of plan. 
  Immigration officials at the Manila airport on Saturday 
expelled Irish Nobel peace prize winner Mairead Maguire, 50, and 
a companion. They arrived from Europe in defiance of the ban. 
  A court on Friday issued an order banning the private 
conference, but leftist organizers vowed to defy the ruling and 
risk arrest. 
  APCET spokesman Joel Saracho said Sunday that at least 12 
foreign delegates are in Manila. 
  The 12 include representatives from the United States, 
Australia and Canada, he said, but did not say when they entered 
the country. 
  Immigration authorities at the Manila airport on Sunday 
decided to expel American university professor Susan Castillo, 
who was suspected to be one of the foreign delegates attending 
the conference. 
  Castillo, 46, who teaches American literature at the 
University of Porto in Portugal and translates books on East 
Timor from Portuguese to English, was aboard a Lufthansa 
airlines flight from Frankfurt and said she was a tourist. 
  Airport immigration chief Felino Quirante said Castillo was 
expected to be put back on the same plane back to Frankfurt late 
Sunday. 
  The woman had earlier said she was only a tourist but later 
admitted during questioning she planned to attend the conference. 
  Also on Sunday, University of the Philippines officials 
banned conference organizers from using the campus and its 
facilities for the meeting. 
  The announcement was released through the presidential 
palace. 
  Saracho said more than 60 other foreign delegates are 
expected before the conference starts on the campus of the 
state-run but autonomous University of the Philippines. 
  Saracho said government agents may have overlooked the 12 
others since they were not on the list. Officials said the list 
could be expanded anytime. 
  The 12 are "prominent in the sense that they have been doing 
East Timor advocacy for a long time," Saracho told AFP. 
  President Fidel Ramos, whose move to ban foreign 
participants 
has been widely criticized here, has said that all 
"non-Filipino" delegates, except journalists and exchange 
students, would be prevented from attending. 
  Critics also noted that the judge who banned the conference 
is a former military officer whom the West Point-trained Ramos 
had appointed. The little known group which had asked the court 
to ban the meeting is being led by a Ramos ally. 
  The East Timor conference has angered Indonesia, which 
accused Manila of allowing itself to be used by the delegates to 
subvert Jakarta's terrirotial integrity. It has asked Ramos to 
stop the seminar. 
  East Timor is a former Portuguese colony which Indonesian 
troops occupied in 1975 and annexed the following year. 
International human rights groups have accused Jakarta of 
alleged rampant human rights abuses in the territory. 
  Ramos has said he was powerless under a democratic 
constutition to ban the meeting, barred foreign participants 
after Jakarta threatened retaliatory measures such as stopping 
to host peace talks betweeen Manila and Moslem secessionist 
rebels in the south and cancelling investments. 
  Political commentators meanwhile said that while the court 
ban has defused the diplomatic crisis between Manila and 
Jakarta, it was a "foreign policy disaster" for the Philippines. 
  "The resolution of the conflict does not erase the fact that 
the crisis has left Philippine diplomacy in shambles," wrote 
Amando Doronila in the Philippine Daily Inquirer. 
  He said it was Manila's "worst humiliation and degradation 
at 
the hands of another country since the Japanese occupation" 
during World War II. 
  "Mr. Marcos is no longer around," said former senator Rene 
Saguisag, referring to ousted Philippine dictator Ferdinand 
Marcos' repressive 20-year rule.

  [Text] A court has banned the East Timor conference. 
Earlier, Judge Marciano Bacalla of Branch 216 of Quezon City 
Regional Trial Court issued a temporary restraining order [TRO]. 
  Under Judge Bacalla's directive, Renato Constantino Jr., 
Augusto Miclat and their colleagues have been barred from 
conducting the East Timor conference. 
  Judge Bacalla has also ordered University of the Philippines 
[UP] President Emilio Javier and UP Law Dean Pacifico Agabin not 
to allow UP and its facilities to be used for the conference. 
  The court's restraining order will take effect on 30 May and 
will last until 4 June. 
  Meanwhile, Renato Constantino Jr., in reaction to the 
restraining order said their lawyers are studying the order of 
Judge Bacalla. Constantino's group is organizing the conference. 
UP President Emilio Javier has declined comment. It will be 
recalled that Javier had denied Malacanang's [presidential 
office] request not to hold the conference at UP. 
  Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Renato De Villa said the 
conference cannot be held anywhere in the country. 
  [Begin recording in English] [De Villa] It says here very 
clearly, whether the venue be within or outside of the premises 
of the University of the Philippines. So, they cannot hold it 
anywhere until this TRO is lifted. 
  [Correspondent] Sir, don't you think this will create more 
trouble? 
  [De Villa] I cannot say because we don't know what's going 
to 
happen. [end recording]

  [Text] The Asia-Pacific Conference on East Timor [APCET] 
will go ahead. The Supreme Court has removed the legal 
obstacles to the holding of the conference after nullifying the 
order earlier issued by Judge Marciano Bacalla of the Quezon 
City Regional Trial Court which prevents the holding of the 
conference. 
  The Supreme Court ordered Bacalla to desist from 
implementing the restraining order which prevented the 
organizers of APCET from holding the conference inside the 
University of the Philippines [UP]. 
  A few minutes after hearing the Supreme Court's decision, 
the 
APCET organizers said the conference will go ahead, starting at 
0700. 
  Meanwhile, Judge Bacalla said that he will abide by the 
Supreme Court decision annulling his order. 
  The Supreme Court, however, supports Ramos' order banning 
foreigners attending the conference. 
  In the meantime, APCET organizers have already started the 
registration of delegates to the conference, scheduled to start 
at 0700 at the Malcolm Hall of UP-Diliman. 
  As of the time of publication, 20 foreign delegates have 
registered. The organizers explained that it is still not final 
as to where the conference will be held. Aside from UP-Diliman, 
other venues are being considered like the San Jose Seminary and 
UP-Manila. 
  According to a report, 40 more foreign delegates are 
expected 
to arrive today. Among the expected delegates is a Japanese who 
is a member of the Diet, identified as Assemblyman (Gona). Gona 
is scheduled to arrive tonight. 
  Immigration personnel are still on alert at the Ninoy Aquino 
International Airport [NAIA] to implement the ban on foreign 
delegates attending the conference. 
  In this regard, two delegates are currently being 
investigated at the immigration office in NAIA. Those being 
questioned are Timorese Zacarias Dakosta of the Timorese 
Democratic Union and Harold Nuncio, who holds an Australian 
passport.

  [Text] President Ramos says the expulsion of two Irish 
nationals who arrived Saturday night to attend the East Timor 
conference was compelled by the national interest. The 
president stressed that the government is pursuing a peace 
process to heal the divisions among the Filipino people. Nobel 
Peace Prize awardee Mairead Corrigan and Tom (Highland) were 
deported immediately after they arrived the NAIA [Ninoy Aquino 
International Airport] last evening. Corrigan is an activist 
like (Highland). 
  University of the Philippines [UP] Chancellor Roger Posadas 
has instructed university officials to disallow organizers and 
participants of the Asia-Pacific Conference on the East Timor or 
APCET from using UP's premises, grounds, and facilities. 
Posadas directive contained in Memorandum No. 94-100 dated 27 
May was in compliance with the restraining order issued by the 
Quezon City Regional Trial Court temporarily preventing the 
conduct of APCET within and outside the university. The 
chancellor's memorandum was addressed to all university deans, 
directors, department chairs, heads of offices and hostel 
managers. The university officials concerned are now preparing 
the formal position that will be presented to the court on this 
case at the appropriate time.

  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan yesterday 
hailed President Bill Clinton's renewal of China's Most Favoured 
Nation trading status and the end of linking trade and human 
rights as a move that would lead to better understanding of 
Thailand. 
  "Every country has its own position on short and long term 
interests," Mr Surin said. 
  "We have a burden of proximity. We stand to face 
repercussions from neighbours in terms of refugees, narcotics or 
weapons. 
  "Western countries, wherever they are, have the luxury of 
distance," he said. 
  "They can make pronouncements without having to consider the 
repercussions." 
  Clinton's decision came under pressure from U.S. businessmen 
who did not want to be excluded from participation in China's 
economic development, Mr Surin said. 
  Fierce competition for trade and investment demanded a 
broadening of outlook, a balanced consideration of principles 
ideals and realities, he claimed. 
  Differences of views between countries of the East and West 
on questions of human rights, democracy and the environment are 
"complex" and "delicate". 
  Clinton's decision would serve as a good example and help 
the 
U.S. and other countries in the West to understand Thailand, he 
said.

  [Text] Speaking during an interview with the press at 
Government House this morning, Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai 
Phanitchaphak said he supported the U.S. decision to continue 
giving trade privileges to China under most favored nation 
status. He said the Chinese people would become even poorer and 
the problem of human rights in China would never be solved if 
the United States decided to stop giving such privileges to 
China because of its poor human rights record. He disagreed 
with the United States for linking trade talks with other 
issues. He said that constituted interference in the internal 
affairs of others. 
  Concerning Thailand, he said the United States tried to link 
the special trade privileges given Thailand with Thailand's 
treatment of its labor issue. Suphachai said this is not 
approriate because Thailand has been trying to solve its problem 
by fully adhering to international norms on labor. The Thai 
Government has always tried to irm the United States whenever 
its labor organizations tried to interfere with or instigate the 
Thai labor force. He said that at the meeting of the 
International Labor Organization, Thailand and its allies would 
try to counter the United States on this matter. 
  Suphachai said that the Thai Government has been trying to 
solve trade problems with the United States by fully complying 
with international rules, such as suppressing pirated tapes, and 
protecting intellectual property. Yet, there are certain areas 
where Thailand cannot comply with U.S. demands. He noted that 
without Thailand as its friend, the United States would hardly 
have any friends left.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri 
spoke with newsmen yesterday evening at the Deville Villa Plaza 
Hotel. He said that fighting between the Burmese Government and 
the Khun Sa forces is not intense now and is quite far from the 
Thai border. If the situation becomes serious and if asked, the 
Foreign Ministry will help by bringing the matter up for 
discussion with the Burmese Government. 
  On the roundtable between the Phnom Penh Government and the 
Khmer Rouge, the foreign minister said the Khmer Rouge has 
softened its position. He said the roundtable is a good sign 
that indicates that peace could follow. The Thai Government 
strongly wishes that all Cambodian factions can reconcile their 
differences and stop the fighting.

  [Text] The fighting between Burmese Government troops and 
minority rebels which broke out along the Burmese-Thai border 
areas opposite Mae Hong Son, Chiang Mai, and Chiang Rai shows no 
sign of cessation. Reinforcements from both sides were sent to 
the battlefields. 
  A report received on 27 May said that the minority rebels 
were well prepared and expected to push the Rangoon troops out 
of the border town of Thachilek soon. The two sides are now 
fighting at 23 different locations in the Shan State. 
Meanwhile, 7,000 rebels are surrounding government strongholds 
at Mong Chot, Mong Pan, and Mong Twan. The government troops in 
the three townships are expected to surrender to the rebels. 
  Two hundred Burmese soldiers were reportedly killed and 
several hundred others wounded during the encounters at Doi Tung 
and Doi Kongmu on the night of 20 May. Rebel casualties were 30 
killed and 65 wounded. The Burmese troops at the three 
locations were assigned to block the road leading to the border 
town of Thachilek. 
  The Border Patrol Police Zone 3 has issued an order 
completely sealing the border with Burma and has pledged to take 
drastic legal action against any persons violating the ban. 
Patrol teams have been sent out to work along the border around 
the clock to cope with any possible territorial infringement. 
  The latest report indicated that Khun Sa's soldiers have 
successfully crossed the Salween River to the western bank 
despite tough resistance from government troops. No reports on 
casualties are available. Three battalions of Khun Sa's Army 
are now surrounding Mong Pyak, Mong Tongi, and Doi Wi, only 30 
kilometers from Tachilek. Khun Sa plans to attack and destroy 
Tachilek before the end of this rainy season. 
  Three hundred and twenty Burmese fled to Thailand from 24 to 
26 May and were later repatriated by Thai authorities. Police 
and military reinforcements were dispatched to guard the border 
in Chiang Rai Province to deter an influx of refugees. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan disclosed that the 
Thai Government has no policy of setting up a new refugee 
holding center. However, refugees from Burma will be allowed to 
stay in the country on a temporary basis.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "America, Don't Miss the Opportunity"] </F>
  [Text] Today is the second day of negotiations between the 
Cambodian Government and Khmer Rouge in Pyongyang. The meeting, 
scheduled to last until 31 May and chaired by King Norodom 
Sihanouk, is aimed at putting an end to the killing among 
Cambodians and finding ways to form a national reconciliation 
government to rule the country. Meanwhile, the United States, 
Australia, and France, in another part of the world, are 
considering sending weapons to Cambodia to prolong the massacre 
in that country. 
  We wish to appeal to all world powers to think carefully 
before sending weapons and military assistance to help the 
Cambodian Government fight the Khmer Rouge. It is not difficult 
to decide to send arms and assistance to Cambodia. However, it 
might be impossible to completely wipe out the Khmer Rouge. 
Hence, sending weapons and assistance to Cambodia is tantamount 
to fanning the flames of war which is a mistake the major powers 
could make in their attempt to solve the Cambodian problem. 
  Judging from the remarks of Thomas Hubbard, U.S. deputy 
assistant secretary of state; and Kent Weidemann, U.S. assistant 
secretary of defense, after their visit to Phnom Pehn and 
consultative meetings with Thai ministers, we feel that the two 
U.S. officials, whose mission was to write a report to help the 
U.S. Government make a final decision, are worried that the 
Phnom Penh Government, without external support, will not be 
able to resist the Khmer Rouge's massive offensive and that the 
country will fall into Khmer Rouge hands. 
  We have a solution to the problem. The Thai people and 
Government believe that the major powers and the international 
community are capable of ending the war in Cambodia this very 
moment by making the two factions recognize each other and form 
a national reconciliation government to rule the country so that 
they can solve all problems at the negotiating table instead of 
fighting an endless war using lives, blood, flesh, and the agony 
of the people as their stakes. 
  Following the stormy accusations made by the Cambodian 
Government about Thai support for the Khmer Rouge, we, the mass 
media, have noticed a decline, to a certain extent, in the Thai 
Government's credibility in this regard. So effective are the 
fabrications, that the United States, France, and Australia are 
induced to give assistance to the Phnom Penh government. We 
wish to remind the United States that a genuine solution to the 
Cambodian problem must include the end of the war and mutual 
recognition among the Cambodian factions. So, the United States 
must think carefully before doing anything. 
  The United States must not miss the opportunity to exploit 
the new expanding market in this region with a total population 
of 350 million. If the international community sets the 
ultimatum for national reconciliation and the end of fighting in 
Cambodia, we do not believe that the Khmer Rouge will be crazy 
enough to risk fighting the war to gain full control of Cambodia 
because it will surely face something it deserves.

  [Text] Chaing Mai -- Thai and US anti-drug authorities 
yesterday arrested a couple in Muang district with 33 kg of 
heroin worth at least Bt47 million on the local market, police 
said. 
  Somnuk Sisaowarak, 29, and Khruawan Monlai, 39, who are 
natives of Mae Hong Son, were arrested at their house in a 
estate on the Chiang Mai-Hot road with 55 bags of powdered 
heroin and 40 bars of compressed heroin, according to police. 
  The team that raided their house also seized one AK-47 
assault rifle, two pistols and more than 50,000 rounds of M-16 
ammunition. 
  Investigators said the two claimed the heroin came from 
Burmese drug warlord Khun Sa, who wanted to trade the drug for 
arms to be used in fighting with Burmese government forces. 
  Khun Sa's army has been engaged in battles with Rangoon 
which 
have intensified recently. 
  The suspects said they were planning to sell the heroin in 
Bangkok. The proceeds would have been used to buy arms from 
traders at the eastern border. The weapons seized by police 
yesterday were also intended to be sent to the warlord, 
according to police. 
  The raid was carried out jointly by local police, officers 
from the Office of the Narcotics Control Board and agents of the 
US Drug Enforcement Administration.

<F P=106> ["FM Spokesman on Working Negotiation Between DPRK and </F>
IAEA"-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the 
Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on 
May 28 answered a question put by KCNA on the working 
negotiation held recently between the DPRK and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency. 
  He said: 
  A working negotiation was held in Pyongyang from May 25 to 
27 
between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the question of the 
replacement of fuel rods at the 5 megawatt experimental atomic 
power station. 
  The main question discussed at the negotiation was the 
method 
of preserving the technical possibilities of the measurement of 
spent fuel rods by the IAEA in case the DPRK undergoes routine 
and ad hoc inspections with a package solution of the nuclear 
issue between the DPRK and the United States in the future. 
  As has been reported, we are refueling the reactor in a 
unique status following the temporary suspension of the 
effectuation of our withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty. Under this condition, we cannot allow routine and ad 
hoc inspections by the agency. But we have clarified our stand 
of good will for fully ensuring the continuity of safeguards 
corresponding to our unique status and for replacing fuel rods 
in such a manner as to preserve technical possibilities of 
selected measurement of fuel rods in the future. 
  The United States, the main party concerned with the 
solution 
of the nuclear issue, also appraised this as encouraging and 
expressed to us the hope that we would discuss its method with 
the agency. 
  At the negotiation, the agency, to begin with, raised the 
method of selected and separated preservation of fuel rods. 
But, an understanding was reached between the sides that it was 
not acceptable in principle for it was essentially an inspection 
activity falling under the category of ad hoc inspection and 
going beyond the unique status of the DPRK. 
  Hence the discussion was focused on the reasonableness of 
the 
method now applied by the DPRK to the replacement of fuel rods. 
  The DPRK side earnestly explained that this is an 
appropriate 
method of sufficiently ensuring technical possibilities of 
freely measuring selected rods as demanded by the agency when 
the unique status of the DPRK is dissolved in the future, while 
guaranteeing the continuity of safeguards to suit its unique 
status at the present stage. 
  And we ensured all conditions for clearly understanding the 
reasonableness of our-style method by allowing the agency 
delegation to go down to the spot and confirm the conditions and 
work there and have sufficient technical consultation with the 
operators of the facilities while the negotiation was on. 
  The agency side took note of the theoretical feasibility of 
this method of ours and its experimental confirmation and 
requested us to arrange its content in writing, promising us to 
profoundly study the efficiency and practical safeguards of this 
method of DPRK style with good will. 
  We stressed that though this method will enlarge a little 
the 
amount of measurement, it is the only way for us to adopt in 
view of the present conditions of political restrictions. We 
promised that we would continue the refueling of the reactor in 
such a manner as to accept a series of opinions of the IAEA side 
concerning this method and would respond any time to negotiation 
that might be proposed by the IAEA side in future. 
  At the negotiation, a final agreement was not reached on the 
DPRK-proposed method, but this method was supplemented and 
perfected through the negotiation. We immediately applied this 
method to the refuelling of the reactor so that the possibility 
of selected measurement of fuel rods could be increased, and we 
are placing the process of all work under a strict supervision 
of the IAEA inspectors and monitoring cameras. 
  We consider that through the negotiation with the IAEA side 
and the monitoring activities of the IAEA inspectors concerning 
the refueling of the reactor, our good will to place our 
peaceful nuclear activities strictly under the control of the 
IAEA was fully manifested. 
  We will actively strive to ensure the transparency of our 
nuclear activities and do the utmost as ever to find a final 
solution to the nuclear issue through the DPRK-USA talks.

<F P=106> ["Obstruction to Replacement of Fuel Rods Denounced" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
refutes the slanders persistently hurled by seditious forces at 
the refueling of the 5 megawatt experimental atomic power 
station of the DPRK. 
  The analyst says: 
  They are demanding the selected separation of fuel rods and 
sampling. This is intended to invent a new pretext for claiming 
credit for the inconsistency faked by them by forcing the DPRK 
to fully implement the safeguards agreement, ignoring its unique 
status. 
  We can never allow this under the present condition, no 
matter what others say and what a counteraction they may take. 
  The United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) have practically recognized the unique status of the DPRK 
after the temporary suspension of the effectuation of its 
withdrawal from the nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. They 
recognized it only yesterday and ignore it today, attempting to 
reverse it. This is a shameless act of denying what they have 
just said in order to attain their sinister aim. 
  It is utterly nonsensical to tell us to suspend the 
refueling 
of the reactor. We had frozen the operation of the graphite 
moderated reactor, suffering enormous economic losses, in the 
hope that the DPRK-U.S. agreement on its conversion into a light 
water reactor would be implemented. 
  However, the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks ended 
abortive and the prospect of the implementation of the agreement 
became dim owing to the perfidy of the United States. Under 
this condition, we cannot allow ourselves to suffer unilateral 
economic losses by freezing the operation of the graphite 
moderated reactor. 
  And to tell us to stop the replacement of fuel rods halfway 
is as good as urging us to reconcile ourselves to the danger of 
radioactive leakage. 
  As regards the refueling of the reactor, we informed the 
agency of it five times, urging it to be present on the scene 
and take necessary measures including the removal of the seals. 
The current refueling is taking place under the strict watch of 
the inspection cameras installed by the agency and the fuel rods 
are placed under the surveillance of the agency as soon as they 
are taken out. Thus, the replacement of fuel rods is being 
carried on from a fully justifiable position. 
  Nevertheless, they demand that we suspend the replacement of 
fuel rods. This means that we should comply with their demand, 
braving colossal economic losses and formidable danger. How can 
we accept their demand? 
  The United States and the agency should feel themselves 
responsible for the impasse where the solution of the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula has reached today and put their 
heart and soul into its removal. 
  The most reasonable solution to the issue is to preserve all 
the replaced fuel rods under the surveillance of the agency and 
measure them when the nuclear problem is solved in a package 
deal in the future. Then the nondivergence of the fuel rods 
replaced this time for another purpose will be guaranteed and 
the uprightness of our past nuclear activities be verified 
through the measurement of all the fuel rods. 
  It is an arrogant stance to insist that anyone must accept 
their demand, though wrong. 
  The international seditious forces must act reasonably, 
clearly knowing that their untenable demand may lead the 
situation to a more complicated phase.

<F P=106> ["Attempt of Seditious Force To Undermine DPRK's Unique </F>
Status"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 29 (KCNA) -- The Russian ambassador 
to South Korea, Kunadze, recently contended that the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea "must observe all its obligations 
under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], since it is its 
signatory." 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says that Kunadze 
and 
others who view the matter this way are, without exception, 
persons who ignore hard facts, swayed by prejudice. 
  The analyst says: 
  The DPRK Government decided to withdraw from the NPT on 
March 
12, 1993, according to paragraph 1, article 10 of the treaty to 
defend the supreme interests of the state. Later, it 
temporarily suspended the effectuation of this withdrawal. It 
is a political commitment we made to the United States for the 
sake of the DPRK-U.S. talks and it does not mean our return to 
the treaty. Therefore, we are not under obligation to fulfill 
the treaty as its signatory. Practically, we have undergone only 
an inspection suited to our status following the temporary 
suspension of the effectuation of our withdrawal from the treaty 
on June 11, 1993. 
  Our unique status has been recognized by the United States 
and the secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
In actuality, the world recognizes our unique status. 
  To ignore our unique status and refuse to reconize it is 
motivated by the sinister purpose of creating the impression 
that we remain in the treaty with a full status, not using the 
word of return to it, and thus finding a pretext of interference 
and pressure and stifling our Republic. And Kunadze has joined 
in it, we dare say. We cannot but pay a special attention to 
the fact that the clamor for denying our special status timed to 
coincide with the refueling at our 5 megawatt experimental 
atomic power station. 
  Our unique status is not dissolved, even if some quarters 
deny and refuse to recognize it. This unique status is not what 
we wanted, but was imposed on us by the United States and the 
agency. 
  We do not intend to maintain the unique status forever. It 
will be dissolved when DPRK-U.S. talks open and a package 
solution is achieved.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the 
Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland 
[CPRF] issued a statement today denouncing the undisguised moves 
in South Korea against the denuclearisation of the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The "unification minister" of South Korea, groundlessly 
vilifying the North at the "foreign affairs and unification 
committee of the National Assembly" on May 23, said "the 
North-South joint declaration on denuclearisation has become 
invalid in actuality" and declared they would "discuss the 
declaration from a new angle." 
  The statement brands these remarks as an open perfidy to the 
North and an unpardonable anti-national criminal act making the 
prospect of North-South relations gloomier, saying: "They meant 
a unilateral nullification of 'joint declaration on the 
denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula' adopted and 
effectuated between the North and the South." 
  "The arbitrary abrogation of the joint declaration vital to 
the nation is a very grave challenge which endangers peace in 
the country and the security of the nation," the statement says, 
and continues: 
  "With no excuse can the South Korean authorities justify 
their act of abrogating the declaration, taking issue with the 
North. There is no justification for the South Korean 
authorities to slander the North over the fictitious 'nuclear 
issue', while keeping mum about the U.S. nuclear weapons 
deployed in South Korea for scores of years. 
  "It is not fortuitous that they unilaterally scrapped the 
hard- won joint declaration on denuclearisation. 
  "Truth to tell, the South Korean authorities have never been 
interested in the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. 
  "At a time when the uprightness of the North's nuclear 
policy 
is being proved more clearly, the South Korean authorities 
openly nullified the declaration, blaming the North. Their main 
purpose in this is to remove the declaration which stands in the 
way of their nuclear arms development and openly promote it. 
  "But the South Korean authorities must ponder over what 
serious impact their perfidious nullification of the declaration 
will have on the North-South relations in the future and what 
catastrophic influence their reckless attempt to promote nuclear 
arms development, free from the declaration, will have on the 
situation in the Korean peninsula and northeast Asia. 
  "They will have to bear full responsibility for all the 
consequences arising from their nullification of the 
declaration."

<F P=106> ["Unpardonable Perfidy" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- It is a most heinous 
crime which can never be justified that the South Korean puppets 
scrapped the joint declaration on denuclearisation, hurling 
groundless slanders at the North, declares NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The analyst says: 
  The South Korean puppet unification minister, Yi Hong-ku, at 
the "National Assembly Committee of Foreign Affairs and 
Unification" recently, heaped abuses on the North and said "the 
North-South joint declaration on denuclearisation has already 
been nullified in actuality," stating that the South "will 
discuss it from a new angle." 
  This meant that they unilaterally scrapped the "joint 
declaration on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula" 
adopted by the North and the South and declared its abrogation. 
This is a treacherous crime never to be condoned and an open 
perfidy and malicious challenge to the North which has made all 
sincere efforts for the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group, after grabbing power, has hastened 
the development of nuclear weapons and engaged themselves in 
well- planned maneuvers to nullify the joint declaration on 
denuclearisation, a hurdle in its way. Practically, the Kim 
Yong- sam traitor group is making haste with the development of 
nuclear weapons in full scale under the "nuclear umbrella" of 
outside forces, trampling upon the joint declaration. 
  Not much penetration is needed to see why they openly 
declared the nullification and renunciation of the joint 
declaration on denuclearisation at a time when the uprightness 
of the North's nuclear policy is being proved more clearly. 
They seek to accelerate the development of nuclear weapons, 
unhindered, by destroying the joint declaration which stands in 
the way of their introduction of nuclear weapons and development 
of their own nuclear arms. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group will have to bear full responsibility 
for all the consequences arising from its perfidy in reducing 
"joint declaration on the denuclearisation of the Korean 
peninsula" to a dead letter.

  [Text] This is news that has just come in. Today about 
50,000 college students staged fierce antigovernment and 
anti-U.S. rallies and marches in Kwangju. They demanded the 
punishment of former rulers who carried out bloodshed oppression 
of Kwangju uprisers who demanded democracy in 1980. 
  Keeping in mind Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, former presidents 
from the military, the students shouted, "These rascals must be 
punished." The students pursued a judicial step against these 
two former presidents over the responsibility of massacring at 
least 200 people while repressing the Kwangju uprising. 
  The protesters condemned the United States for having played 
a certain role in this repression, and stressed that Washington 
approved this tacitly. Although the United States denied this, 
protests regarding the Kwangju uprising always had a deep 
anti-U.S. nature. 
  The students hung a large U.S. flag this morning, and burned 
it by shooting a blazing arrow. The police said that they will 
block the students' march at a point 100 meters away from the 
U.S. Cultural Center. 
  Although there was no immediate report on clashes in today's 
rally, the atmosphere in the venue of the rally was grave 
[homak]. 
  Some students were carrying iron pipes and fire bottles. 
Police did not appear in the site as if not to irritate the 
feeling of the participants in the rally. 
  The rally in Kwangju was held on the second day of the 
annual 
meeting of the student organization embracing students 
throughout South Korea. 
  On 28 May, about 30,000 students held a peaceful rally in 
the 
playground of Choson University in Kwangju. Approximately 
15,000 policemen were deployed in town. But they watched the 
rally from a distant place. 
  In addition to their appeal for judicial steps against Chon 
Tu- hwan and No Tae-u, the students are opposed to the opening 
of South Korean rice markets. They are also demanding the 
withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Korean peninsula. 
  The students asserted that the agreement on opening of South 
Korean rice markets was made by the U.S. pressure.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Raps Kim Yong-sam Group's Flunkeyist </F>
Treacheries" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- The acute and strained 
situation of the Korean peninsula is a product of outside 
forces' policy of aggression and the flunkeyist and treacherous 
policy of the Kim Yong-sam regime, which is prolonging its days 
by clinging to their coattails, says NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined 
article today. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam, who swore an oath to serve the 
United States, is zealously toeing the master's policy of 
aggression and war and working for the latter's interests, the 
article says, and continues: 
  Depending on the American master for its survival, the Kim 
Yong- sam group is entreating him for "protection" and for the 
permanent presence of U.S. Forces in South Korea. The puppets 
have never let a chance pass by without describing the U.S. 
Forces in South Korea as "a deterrent to war" and "apostle of 
peace." They are making no bones about donating billions of 
dollars every year for keeping the U.S. troops in South Korea. 
  Not contented with this, they have left South Korea as a 
test 
ground of "the new military strategy" of the U.S. Forces and a 
military intelligence base against the North. 
  The Kim Yong-sam regime is, indeed, a group of traitors 
trying to slay the fellow countrymen in the North with the sword 
of outside forces. The puppets are trying to stifle the North, 
serving as a shock brigade in the nuclear clamour of the 
imperialist reactionaries. 
  There have been no small number of traitors in South Korea. 
But there has never been such a fellow as the traitor Kim 
Yong-sam who is running about so desperately to slay fellow 
countrymen with the help of outside forces. The Kim Yong-sam's 
is really a group of traitors outstripping their predecessors, 
traitors without an equal.

<F P=106> ["Truculent Fascist Dictator Under `Civilian' Mask" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 31 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
carries a by-lined article titled "Truculent Fascist Dictator 
Under 'Civilian' Veil." 
  Though the traitor Kim Yong-sam has paid lip-service to 
"democratic politics" and "reformed politics" since he came to 
power, he, in actuality, has pursued more cruel repressive 
politics than the preceding military fascist dictators', the 
article says, and continues: 
  The puppet beefed up the riot police by 17,000 men in his 
first days in power and then by nearly 40,000 men of hundreds of 
companies up to now. "Special detective teams" have been 
installed at police stations throughout South Korea and more 
than 1,500 "patrol cars 112" and other repressive equipment have 
been additionally deployed there. 
  Now the notorious "National Security Law" remains unchanged 
and such repressive tools as "the Security Planning Board," "the 
secret affairs command" and "the police agency" have been 
further expanded and strengthened in South Korea. This proves 
that the traitor Kim Yong-sam is a truculent fascist dictator 
wearing the "civilian" mask. 
  The fascist clique have defined the South Korean Federation 
of General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon), the successor to the 
National Council of Student Representatives (Chondaehyop), as "a 
pro-North organization" and "an organization benefiting the 
enemy." They made abortive by force the talks between students 
in the North and the South and the fourth pan-national rally in 
Seoul in June and August last year and, worse still, they 
arrested hundreds of students on the spot and jailed the 
chairman of Hanchongnyon and many other core elements of the 
student movement on the charge of violations of the "National 
Security Law." 
  The fascist clique have also suppressed the struggle of the 
workers for vital rights and democratic freedom by invoking even 
"the emergency arbitration power," which the preceding dictators 
had not dared employ. 
  When peasants and people of other strata and students 
demonstrated against agricultural market opening on February 1, 
the Kim Yong-sam group mobilized 130 companies of riot police 
more than 15,000 strong and let them fire multiple teargas 
canisters at the demonstrators, leaving many of them wounded, 
and walk off some 400 demonstrators. 
  There is nothing to be expected from the Kim Yong-sam 
fascist 
regime. It is only too clear that with this regime left alone, 
it is impossible to meet the demand of the people for 
independence, ensure their democratic rights and achieve 
national reunification.

  [Text] According to a broadcast report from Seoul, traitor 
Kim Yong-sam on 27 May toured a combat fighters corps, the 
headquarters of an army division in the frontline area, and the 
headquarters of a Navy fleet. He babbled that an impregnable 
guard posture against North Korea should be assumed. 
  This warmonger, wearing a mask of civilian politics, also 
raved that now is a very dangerous time, one should have 
strength, and so forth. He had fighters stage an emergency 
mobilization training, and inspected the guard posture of the 
puppet army units against North Korea in the frontline area. 
Thus, he frantically ran amok to instigate war fever. 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam's tour of frontline areas this time was 
a thoroughgoing war junket aimed at confirming the posture of 
readiness of the puppet army for a northward aggression and at 
provoking a war against us at any time.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 31 (KCNA) -- Papers here today 
denounce the traitor Kim Yong-sam for whipping up a war fever 
during his "inspection" of units of the puppet ground, naval and 
air forces. 
  An analyst of NODONG SINMUN says: 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam recently "inspected" units of the 
puppet Army and incited confrontation and war, crying for 
"establishment of an iron-wall alert posture against the North." 
This fully revealed the treacherous nature of the "civilian" 
warmaniac who seeks a way out in opposing fellow countrymen in 
collusion with outside forces. 
  The traitor is these days letting no chance pass by without 
giving a shriek, as if invasion from the North were imminent. 
But no one lends an ear to his outcry reminding one of the 
guilty party filing the suit first. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group is openly having confabs with 
bellicose quarters of the United States for a war against the 
North and unhesitatingly talking about "retaliatory punishment" 
and "opportunity of unification," while raising outcries over 
"nuclear suspicion" against the North. 
  The South Korean puppets have even worked out with the 
United States a war scenario against the North codenamed "New 
Operation Plan 5027." Judging from this, their current movements 
are very ill- boding. 
  The traitors bereft of reason, driven to a blind alley, 
might 
ignite a war any moment. However, it cannot be a way out for 
them but and will only precipitate their own destruction. 
  A MINJU CHOSON analyst warns: The Korean people and People's 
Army are always vigilant against the military moves of the 
puppets and, if they attempt to harm fellow countrymen in 
collusion with outside forces, will sternly punish them.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Hysterics of the Warmonger"] </F>
  [Text] According to reports, on 28 May, the traitor Kim 
Yong- sam instigated a war mood while visiting a puppet combat 
air corps, an Army unit in the eastern front line, and a Navy 
fleet headquarters in succession. 
  Saying that it is possible to maintain peace on the Korean 
peninsula only when they [South Koreans] are strong, he ordered 
soldiers to be put on air-tight alertness, to make every 
preparation for anti-aircraft alertness, and so on. This is a 
deliberate maneuver to further aggravate the situation on the 
Korean peninsula made tense by them, and plainly shows their 
frenzy for a war of northward invasion. 
  The puppet traitor blared as if we were about to make a 
sudden raid on the South, saying that this is a very dangerous 
time. This is a shameless preposterous sophistry, like an act 
of a thief raising a hue and cry. 
  Who is in fact making the situation tense and increasing the 
danger of war on the Korean peninsula? It is needless to say 
that it is the U.S. imperialists and the U.S. stooge, the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet clique itself. 
  As was reported, the U.S. imperialists have brought Patriot 
missiles and Apache attack helicopters into South Korea under 
the pretext of our so-called nuclear issue and has now put the 
aircraft carrier Independence in a location at sea from which it 
may take one week or less for the aircraft carrier to arrive to 
the Korean peninsula. 
  In the meantime, the U.S. ruling classes are making the 
belligerent outburst that they should make an air raid on our 
nuclear facilities for peaceful purposes or attack them with 
cruise missiles. Following their U.S. master's war maneuver, the 
puppets put the puppet armed forces on a state of alert and are 
watching for a chance to invade the North. 
  What the puppets mean by peace is that they would provoke a 
war of northward invasion, and what they mean by strength to be 
increased is that they would further strengthen preparations for 
a war of northward invasion. 
  These facts clearly prove that only northward threats, not 
southward ones, exist on the Korean peninsula and that it is 
none other than the U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam 
puppet clique who try to provoke a war. 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam, however, talked about being alert 
against us. This shameless trick [paryomchihan sujak], like an 
act of a thief raising a hue and cry, has revealed his vicious 
intention to push the puppet armed forces out to a war of 
northward invasion by aggravating the situation. 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam, with a civilian mask, is indeed a more 
vicious warmonger than military gangsters although he is wearing 
civilian clothes. He takes no regard for peace or for the 
country's reunification. Puppet Kim Yong-sam's instigation of a 
war mood is nothing but hysterics of one who has lost reason. 
  As everyone knows, the puppets have been frenzied in 
carrying 
out war preparations while stirring up a commotion over our 
nuclear issue. Our nuclear policy, however, has proved more 
clearly to be innocent as days go by, while the slanderous 
nature of the puppets' nuclear commotion has been exposed to the 
light of day. 
  The South Korean people are vigorously waging the anti-U.S., 
antiwar, and antinuclear struggle, and their willpower for 
independent reunification is rapidly growing. 
  Embarrassed by this, the puppets are trying to turn the 
growing struggling spirit of the people to the South-North 
confrontation by any means so that they can realize their scheme 
for a war. One can guess how much he was embarrassed from the 
fact that traitor Kim Yong-sam busied himself visiting puppet 
units after giving up keeping appearances. 
  It is natural that those who have been driven into a corner 
make all frenzied attempts. Such maneuvers, however, will only 
expose the true nature of warmongers, splittists, and will only 
result in hastening their own ruin. 
  Nothing can block the nation's grand march toward peace and 
reunification. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique should look 
straight at the trend of the time and behave discreetly.

<F P=106> ["Unseemly Act of Puppet" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppet 
foreign minister, Han Sung-chu, recently flew to a Southeast 
Asian country and entreated it to play "the role of a mediator 
between the United States and the DPRK in the solution of the 
nuclear issue of the North", according to a report. 
  Lurking behind it is a sinister attempt of the puppets to 
create complexity by inveigling "a mediator" into the DPRK-U.S. 
talks for the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The DPRK-U.S. talks has not made a smooth progress because 
the United States reversed the New York agreement and 
deliberately laid obstacles to the solution of the nuclear issue. 
  There is no doubt that a bright prospect will open before 
the talks, if the United States stop the international campaign 
for pressure on the DPRK and sincerely approach the DPRK-U.S. 
talks, though belatedly, and the South Korean puppets do not try 
to thrust its nose into it and obstruct it. Hence, it is as 
clear as noonday that no "mediator" is needed between the DPRK 
and the United States in solving the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Han Sung-chu, however, brought forward the question of 
"mediator" who is not needed at all in the solution of the 
question during his foreign trip. This shows well how 
persistently the puppets are trying to put a spoke in the wheel 
of the DPRK-U.S. talks again. 
  Facts clearly prove that the Kim Yong-sam group is, indeed, 
a 
group of traitors who are working round the clock to encumber 
the DPRK-U.S. talks for the solution of the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula, roaming aimlessly. 
  The South Korean puppet clique must stop the anachronistic 
act, squarely facing the trend of the times.

<F P=106> ["Ambition for Domination Over Asia Cannot Be Realized"KCNA </F>
headine] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists' 
wild ambition to dominate Asia can never be realized, stresses 
NODONG SINMUN in a signed article today. 
  The United States is trying to break up and stifle socialist 
countries in Asia with its "peaceful transition" strategy as 
well as its policy of "strength" and put other non-socialist 
countries under its control by applying the American view of 
value, but it is met by a storm of objections in these 
countries, the paper notes, and goes on: 
  The United States has got nothing from its anti-socialist 
moves. 
  The Korean people have firmly defended socialism, their life 
and soul, pushing aside the U.S. strategy of "peaceful 
transition". The U.S. strategy of "peaceful transition" to 
isolate and stifle Asian socialist countries and revive 
capitalism has become impotent. 
  It has also failed in its maneuvers against Asian countiries 
which aspire after independence. 
  In recent years the spirit of independence has grown in 
Asian 
countries and there are such positive movements as promoting 
bilateral and multilateral cooperation in various fields and 
taking joint steps in external relations. This is a reflection 
of the aspiration of people to develop independently free from 
the domination and intervention of the imperialists. 
  Developing countries in Asia are rejecting the West's 
"standard of human rights", saying "it cannot be a model." They 
are also rejecting the "democracy" of American style, saying "it 
is not suitable for them." 
  The Asian people are maintaining their mental and cultural 
traditions, turning down "freedom" and "democracy" of American 
style. 
  All facts show that whatever means and ways the United 
States 
may apply, it can never stamp out socialist countries and 
developing countries in Asia.

<F P=106> [Commentary by station commentator Kim Ho-sam: "Dangerous </F>
Military Moves"] 
  [Text] According to the recent issue of the British weekly 
magazine specializing in military affairs, JANE'S DEFENCE 
WEEKLY, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry handed out a directive to 
the U.S. aircraft carrier, Independence, to assume an alert 
posture in the area from which it can reach the Korean peninsula 
within a week. 
  Reporting this, the paper wrote that this step is designed 
to 
promptly cope with the crisis if it emerges on the Korean 
peninsula. Such a report by the British paper specializing in 
military affairs is not an accident at all. 
  As has been known, the hardline conservative faction in the 
U.S. Congress and Government, and impure forces who collaborated 
with international reactionaries recently made intolerable, 
violent, and bellicose remarks one after another on the pretext 
of our so-called nuclear issue. 
  Concerning the replacement of nuclear fuel rods in our 
experimental nuclear power station, the U.S. hardline 
conservative faction raved that we should suspend the 
replacement, the International Atomic Energy Agency should 
choose fuel rods and keep them separately, and so forth. Thus, 
it raised a unreasonable [ichie matti annun] demand. 
  As we refused this demand, U.S. Senator McCain on 24 May 
made 
violent remarks at the Senate that North Korean nuclear 
facilities should be air raided or attacked with cruise missiles. 
  Moreover, U.S. Vice President Gore, stating that 
continuously 
holding talks with North Korea is dangerous, said that so-called 
security steps taken by the United States for South Korea are 
all wise. The wise steps he referred to mean the Patriot 
missiles and Apache offensive helicopters that were deployed in 
South Korea some time ago. 
  At a time when the U.S. hardline conservative faction openly 
calls for attacking the experimental nuclear power station in 
our country, the U.S. defense secretary is attempting to launch 
and put a mobilization posture on the carrier Independence in 
the area close to the Korean peninsula. This illustrates that 
the United States has not discarded at all the ambition to crush 
[apsal] the popular mass-centered socialist system of our own 
style by means of force and by mobilizing all of its Navy and 
Air Force on the pretext of our nuclear problem. 
  As has been known, the carrier Independence is an 
ultra-large 
carrier based in Yokosuka, Japan after replacing the Midway some 
time ago. This carrier has experience in directly participating 
in landing exercises on the sea off Pohang when the Team Spirit 
joint military exercise was staged in 1991. 
  The United States is planning to deploy this ultra-large 
carrier in the sea close to the Korean peninsula. This proves 
that the U.S. bellicose circles are going to launch a surprise 
attack on our Republic at a certain time [ku onuttaee kasonun] 
on the pretext of so-called nuclear development in collusion 
with Japanese Self- Defense Force troops that are concentrated 
in western Japan facing the Korean peninsula. 
  What we should not overlook in particular is that the 
directive of the U.S. defense secretary is to be executed during 
the period of Rimpac training which continues from the end of 
May until mid-July. 
  As was already reported, during the period of Rimpac 
training, the United States will organize a joint fleet with the 
Japanese naval self-defense force and the South Korean puppet 
navy for the first time since this military training started in 
1970, and will carry out joint operations with them. 
  Concerning the plan of U.S. Navy, the Japanese naval 
self-defense force, and the puppet South Korean navy to organize 
a joint fleet and to stage the Rimpac training, the 
director-general of the Japanese Defense Agency openly stated 
that this plan will serve as a political message against the 
North Korean nuclear plan. This clearly shows that this joint 
fleet is aiming at our Republic. 
  The fact that under this situation, the carrier Independence 
will move to an area close to the Korean peninsula and be placed 
on alert status shows that the tripartite military alliance 
system between the United States, Japan, and South Korea is 
actually in motion. 
  Because of such policy for crushing the DPRK by the United 
States, a very dangerous situation is prevailing on the Korean 
peninsula. This arouses deep concern among the peaceloving 
people of the world. The people of the world wish that the 
nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula be resolved peacefully 
through dialogue and negotiations. However, the U.S. hardline 
conservative faction is continuously scheming to carry out 
adventurous military action. 
  However, this is not beneficial to the United States itself, 
nor will this situation advance as the United States wants 
[kurona kugosun miguk chacherul wihaesodo iropchi mottamyo, 
ttohan migugui uidodoeronun kyolko toeji annul kosimnida]. 
  The U.S. policy for crushing the DPRK is very harmful from 
the standpoint of not only U.S. interests but also of peace and 
security of Northeast Asia. The U.S. attempt to crush us by 
means of force is a great mistake. 
  We are prepared for war and for negotiations. The United 
States should not adhere to adventurous military action, but had 
better act with discretion.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Condemns U.S. New Missile Development </F>
Program"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 29 (KCNA) -- The U.S. Defense 
Department is now going ahead with the program for developing a 
latest-type missile to detect and destroy the missiles "hidden 
underground" in the North of Korea. 
  NODONG SINMUN today says this is a typical expression of the 
arrogance of the United States, which has customed to encroach 
upon the sovereignty of other nations. 
  The detection and destruction of military equipment of other 
countries are an unilateral exercise of armed forces against 
sovereign states and a gross infringement on their sovereignty, 
the analyst says, and continues: 
  The program is aimed at making a forestalling attack on the 
DPRK and stifling it. 
  The U.S. authorities' talk about "nuclear nonproliferation" 
is a sophism for strengthening its military predominance, the 
nuclear supremacy and justifying the military terrorism and 
invasion against the nations out of their favor. 
  The acceleration of a new-type missile development by the 
U.S. conservative hardliners under the cloak of "nuclear 
nonproliferation" can never be justified in every respect. 
  As for the nuclear proliferation, its chief culprit is none 
other than the United States. The United States has produced a 
large number of nuclear weapons and deployed them in different 
parts of the world. And it has helped Israel, Japan and South 
Korea in nuclear armament, conniving at it. 
  "Nuclear nonproliferation" cried for by the U.S. authorities 
is nothing but a veil for covering up their crimes in nuclear 
proliferation and justifying their nuclear monopolization and 
the development of sophisticated weapons. 
  The acceleration of the program for developing a latest-type 
missile may drive to a more dangerous phase the the Korean 
situation which remains acute. The United States must be held 
wholly responsible for the possible consequences. 
  We are keeping tabs on the moves of the United States. 
  The United States must promptly give up the inconsiderate 
program for developing new-type missile against the DPRK.

<F P=106> ["`Guideline' for Military Intervention" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN in a 
by-lined article Sunday says the "UN Peacekeeping Operation 
[PKO] Guideline" published by the United States some time ago is 
aimed at going ahead with military intervention and establishing 
domination and control over the world by using the United 
Nations, while evading losses in a more cunning way. 
  The article reads in part: 
  The U.S. president retracted the call for founding a "UN 
standing Army" which he had made during his election campaign, 
and worked out and published a new policy on the "UN PKO". This 
is connected with their interests and also with the repeated 
failures of U.S. Forces- led "UN peacekeeping operations" in 
recent years. 
  The publication of the new "UN PKO Guideline" by the United 
States does never mean that it has ruled out military 
intervention against other countries or abandoned its ambition 
to establish domination over the world. 
  The U.S. representative at the United Nations told a 
congressional hearing that the basic purpose of the new policy 
was to make the UN refrain from operations unacceptable to the 
United States and help in such operations as the United States 
wants. By such operations as the United States wants he meant 
military operations needed for executing their aggressive 
foreign policies. 
  That is why the United States is committed to keeping its 
forces as part of UN Forces only in case its forces 
participating in the "UN peacekeeping operations" shall not be 
placed under the command of foreign forces but exercise 
operational command like at the time of the Gulf war or the 
Korean war. 
  The U.S. decision to drastically cut back its contribution 
to 
UN peacekeeping spendings was motivated, in the final analysis, 
by its scheme to bring the UN under its control through 
increased financial pressure and commit military aggression and 
intervention against other countries by abusing the name of the 
UN, if necessary. 
  The United States must discard the wild ambition to dominate 
and control other countries with recourse to its policy of 
"strength".

  [Text] President Kim Il-song of the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea made a speech at the banquet he hosted today 
at the Kumsusan Assembly Hall in honour of His Majesty King of 
Cambodia Norodom Sihanouk and participants in the roundtable 
conference for peace and national reconciliation of Cambodia. 
  Saying he was very pleased to sit together with his Majesty 
King Norodom Sihanouk and high-ranking leaders of Cambodia 
participating in the roundtable, President Kim Il-song stated: 
  Your majesty esteemed King Norodom Sihanouk and esteemed 
high-ranking leaders of Cambodia: I am very pleased to be with 
your majesty esteemed King Norodom Sihanouk and high-ranking 
leaders of Cambodia who have participated in the roundtable 
conference for peace and national reconciliation of Cambodia 
held in our country. 
  Your majesty esteemed king, your excellency Prince Chea Sim, 
your royal highness Prince Norodom Ranariddh, your excellency 
Prince Hun Sen and your excellency Khieu Samphan are all our 
close friends. You are participants in the roundtable conference 
of Cambodia as well as distinguished guests of our people. 
  I would like to bid a hearty welcome to you, our intimate 
friends, and also sincerely congratulate you on your success in 
the roundtable conference for peace and national reconciliation 
in Cambodia which has been held under the guidance of your 
majesty King Norodom Sihanouk. 
  I believe the fact that the high-ranking leaders of Cambodia 
have held the roundtable conference in Pyongyang this time is an 
expression of your friendship towards us and your trust in us. 
  The roundtable conference has been held by the direct 
proposal and effort of your majesty esteemed King Norodom 
Sihanouk, an outstanding patriot of Cambodia and father of the 
Khmer nation. 
  Your majesty, with intense love for your country and a 
strong 
will, has devoted everything to the cause of the country's 
independence and national dignity with unshakable confidence in 
spite of the many tortuous events you have undergone from early 
years. Today you are working energetically for national 
reunification and unity and peace in your country. 
  Celebrating your traditional new year with the Cambodian 
people since your return home from the visit to our country last 
April, your majesty esteemed king has inspired them with great 
confidence and courage and, in spite of ill health, has been 
making unremitting efforts to deal with complex political 
affairs. In particular, you have put forward a reasonable 
proposal for achieving national reconciliation and restoring 
peace in your country and have made various arrangements to put 
it into practice. We speak highly of your majesty's noble 
patriotism and outstanding statecraft. 
  Realizing national reconciliation and restoring peace in 
Cambodia is an important matter which affects the country's 
destiny. 
  Displaying a high degree of patriotism at the roundtable 
conference, the high-ranking leaders of Cambodia have brought 
about good results to meet the expectations of the Cambodian 
people and the progressive people of the world, and thus made a 
historic contribution to realizing national reconciliation and 
restoring peace in Cambodia. 
  Cambodian people are a talented and diligent people who have 
a long history and have created a splendid culture. We believe 
that the high-ranking leaders of Cambodia and her people will 
successfully build an independent, peaceful and prosperous new 
Cambodia, in support of the noble will of your majesty esteemed 
King Norodom Sihanouk. Your Majesty esteemed King: 
  The Korean and Cambodian peoples have established strong 
ties 
of friendship on the road of independence from early days and 
closely supported and cooperated with each other. Our people 
who value the relations of friendship and cooperation with the 
Cambodian people will, in the future, too, work hard to expand 
and develop the friendship with the Cambodian people and 
actively support your majesty's stand for peace and national 
reconciliation in Cambodia. 
  Availing myself of this meaningful opportunity, I propose a 
toast to the friendship and unity between the Korean people and 
the Cambodian people; to the prosperity and thriving of the 
Kingdom of Cambodia; to the good health and long life of your 
majesty esteemed King Norodom Sihanouk; to the good health of 
your majesty Queen Norodom (Moniniet) Sihanouk; to the good 
health of your excellency esteemed Prince Chea Sim; to the good 
health of your royal highness esteemed Norodom Ranariddh and of 
your excellency esteemed Prince Hun Sen; to the good health of 
your excellency esteemed Khieu Samphan; to the good health of 
various friends and comrades of Cambodia present here.

<F P=106> [Speech by King Norodom Sihanouk of the Kingdom of Cambodia </F>
at a banquet hosted by President Kim Il-song in the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea at the Kumsusan Assembly Hall on 28 
May] 
  [Text] Your Excellency most esteemed Generalissimo, 
president of the Republic: 
  Your Excellency, respected and beloved great leader--the 
most 
distinguished of the Korean nation and people--has arranged this 
unforgettable grand banquet out of your invariable benevolent 
consideration for Cambodia, its people, and my royal family, and 
extended a very kind and well-meaning invitation. This is the 
highest honor and a historic event for all the leaders of 
Cambodia present here and the Cambodian people. In the name of 
all Cambodian people, I am extending the noblest, everlasting 
wholehearted gratitude to Your Excellency, the father of the 
Korean people, independence, and prosperity, reflecting our 
highest respect and emotion. Your Excellency, most esteemed 
Generalissimo, president of the Republic: 
  Cambodia which formally restored independence, territorial 
integrity, national unity and peace following the signing of the 
Paris peace accord on October 23, 1991, has striven to 
substantually restore national unity and peace up until now, but 
no success worth mentioning has been made. 
  Unfortunately, the civil war is going on between the Royal 
Government of Cambodia and the Democratic Cambodia side, 
imposing ineffable sufferings upon the innocent peaceable 
population of Cambodia. 
  A roundtable conference, a top-level conference for peace 
and 
national reconciliation between the factions of Cambodia, had to 
be organized very urgently with a view to ending this tragic 
civil war for today and tomorrow of Cambodia and the Cambodian 
nation. 
  Very significant and noteworthy here is that the Cambodian 
leaders have reached a consensus on choosing Pyongyang, the 
attractive capital of the so glorious, friendly and fraternal 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as the venue of the 
conference. 
  The fact that all the leaders of Cambodia have chosen 
Pyongyang as the historical place of the roundtable conference 
for peace and national reconciliation, their summit conference, 
is an expression of Cambodia's full trust in your excellency the 
prominent President Generalissimo Kim Il-song, the most intimate 
friend and steadfast supporter of the Cambodian people. 
  Your excellency most respected and beloved generalissimo, 
president of the Republic: Allow me to express our noblest, 
courteous and eternal thanks to your excellency for the warm 
kindness, goodwill and incomparably excellent hospitality 
accorded us, for the flawless preparations you have let 
competent officials of Korea make for our roundtable conference, 
thus making it possible for the leaders of the State of Cambodia 
and the Democratic Cambodia side to achieve positive results of 
unanimous support to the principles of effecting a cease-fire, 
though the date is yet to be designated, defending the national 
and territorial unity of the country, forming a standing 
committee made up of the factions of Cambodia whose mission it 
will be to discuss and solve one by one the pending issues 
between the Royal Government of Cambodia and the Democratic 
Cambodia side, and of maintaining fraternal working ties, at the 
current conference for Cambodia and its people. 
  I express boundless admiration in the name of Cambodia and 
its people to you who have made immortal, tireless efforts for 
the liberation of Korea and her all-around development of high 
degree and made historical contributions to a victory of the 
struggle of the third world peoples for freedom, dignity, 
justice, peace and progress. 
  Royal Cambodia has always stood on your side from 1965 and 
constantly expressed its full and unflinching support for your 
most patriotic and heroic policies of opposing all forms of 
outside interference in the internal affairs of the DPRK 
including the national defence issue and rejecting threats from 
big powers, and this position will never change in the future. 
  We also firmly support and will support in the future, too, 
the lucid and wise and most patriotic proposals made by you for 
the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea. 
  Out of this sentiment, in the name of the Cambodians present 
here, I propose a toast to the everlasting good health and long 
life, and everlasting glory of your excellency generalissimo, 
president of the DPRK, Kim Il-song, the respected and beloved 
great leader of the Korean nation and people; to the good 
health, long life, and glory of his excellency Marshal Kim 
Chong-il, the dear leader of the Korean people and the supreme 
commander of the Korean People's Army; to the good health of 
esteemed Madame Kim Song-ae; to the everlasting friendship and 
invincible unity between the Kingdom of Cambodia and the DPRK; 
to the good health of your excellency Premier Kang Song-san and 
his wife; to the good health of your excellency Vice President 
Yi Chong-ok; to the good health of your excellencies of Korea 
and their wives present here; and to the good health of the 
Korean friends present here.

  A roundtable conference for peace and national 
reconciliation 
of Cambodia took place at the Changsuwon guesthouse on May 27 
and 28, 1994, according to the noble intention of His Majesty 
King Norodom Sihanouk of the Kingdom of Cambodia, on the 
conference. The meeting presided over by His Majesty King was 
attended by Prince Chea Sim, president of the National Assembly 
of the Kingdom of Cambodia, H.R.H. [His Royal Highness] Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh, first prime minister, and Prince Hun Sen, 
second prime minister, of the royal government of Cambodia, and 
H.E.[His Excellency] Khieu Samphan, president of the Democratic 
Cambodia side. 
  Also present at the conference were senior advisors to the 
King who are princes, and Prince Monkol Tebwacha and Prince Maha 
Kossanda, priests. 
  1. His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk of the Kingdom of 
Cambodia, upon opening the conference, expressed warmest thanks, 
in the name of the entire Cambodian people, to His Excellency 
Generalissimo Kim Il-song, the great leader of the Korean nation 
and people and president of the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea, and to his Excellency Marshal Kim Chong-il, the dear 
leader of the Korean people and supreme commander of the Korean 
People's Army, and to all the high-ranking officials of Korea 
for the warmest welcome and hospitality accorded the Cambodian 
delegation and for all the conditions and conveniences provided 
for the roundtable conference. 
  2. The participants in the conference reached a consensus of 
view on Cambodia being an indivisible one unified state and on 
the noble desire of the Cambodian people to achieve the 
territorial integrity of the country (the borders of land, sea 
and islands were recognized internationally in the 1963-1969 
period), peace, solidarity, national unity and independence and 
the development of Cambodia and expressed sympathy and support 
for it. And they admitted that to prevent the division of the 
territory, achieve unification, remove national discord and win 
unity is necessary for the existence of the nation. 
  3. They, at the proposal of respected His Majesty King, 
affirmed their will to make efforts to put an end to the war as 
early as possible for a permanent ceasefire, national 
reconciliation and peace. 
  4. The participants agreed to set up a standing committee of 
the round-table conference for peace and national reconciliation 
to find a solution to the problems of national reconciliation 
and unity. 
  They shared the identical view on holding the first session 
of the standing committee of the round-table conference in Phnom 
Penh on June 15, 1994. 
  The Cambodian delegation expressed thanks to respected his 
Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk for rendering positive efforts to 
bring genuine unity, peace and national reconciliation to 
Cambodia and the Cambodian people. 
  The participants in the round-table conference with a sense 
of heavy responsibility for Cambodia and the Cambodian people 
closed the conference on May 28, 1994 in an atmosphere of mutual 
understanding.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Prime 
Minister, Tsutomu Hata, requested an active support of Western 
countries including France and Germany, saying "Japan is playing 
a role commensurate with the status of permanent members of the 
United Nations Security Council in all fields including politics 
and the economy," and said at the budget committee of the House 
of Representatives on May 24 that Japan is actively aspiring 
after a permanent member of the UN Security Council. 
  Commenting on his remarks, a MINJU CHOSON analyst today 
says: 
  This fully shows how desperately the Japanese authorities 
are 
trying to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council. 
  It is too shameless and impertinent an act for the Japanese 
authorities to covet for a permanent seat on the UN Security 
Council. 
  Although nearly half a century has passed since World War 
II, 
Japan is still failing to clearly repent of its crimes. 
  It is reinforcing its "self-defence forces" with 
sophisticated military equipment, steadily increasing military 
spendings even after the cold war came to an end. 
  Japan's nuclear armament which has reached the danger line 
in 
actuality poses a big threat to peace and security in the Korean 
peninsula and Asia. 
  It is only too natural that Japan with such background 
cannot 
become a permanent member of the UN Security Council, and it is 
as clear as noonday what grave consequences will arise in case 
Japan should obtain a permanent seat.

<F P=106> ["Opportunity for Reinvasion Must Not be Allowed" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- The Japanese authorities 
are mobilizing news media in an effort to secure a permanent 
membership of the U.N. Security Council. They are deliberately 
building up at home and abroad the public opinion that Japan is 
possessed of all qualifications for the permanent membership 
and, therefore, should naturally become a permanent member. At 
the same time, they are feverishly lobbying to gain support from 
many countries. 
  NODONG SINMUN today brands this as an expression of the 
arrogance of revived militarism and a mockery of the 
international community. 
  The news analyst says: 
  Japan intends to become a political power and military power 
and justify its military action overseas by gaining the seat of 
a permanent member. 
  What is more serious is that Japan seeks to get the 
international community to recognise its nuclear armament. 
  Japan, having made all material and technical preparations 
for becoming a nuclear power, plans to overcome the opposition 
of public opinion to and legal restrictions on nuclear armament 
by securing permanent membership. 
  To become a permanent member is a spring-board for the 
Japanese ruling quarters. 
  As seen above, the Japanese authorities' zealous effort to 
become a permanent member is chiefly aimed at becoming a 
military power and nuclear power, participating in the scrambles 
for world domination and opening a favorable phase for realising 
their dominationist ambition with strength. 
  To allow Japan which has not parted with its militarist past 
to become a permanent member means to encourage it to repeat the 
crimes of the blood-stained past. 
  Japan is not qualified to become a permanent member so long 
as it fails to sincerely repent of its past aggression and atone 
for it clearly. 
  Japan must liquidate the past before it tries to become a 
permanent member.

<F P=106> ["Wicked Scheme of Dishonest Force in Slandering Ill of </F>
Confederacy Formula in View of Yemen Situation" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- A NODONG SINMUN analyst 
today hits out at the Japanese reactionaries and the South 
Korean puppets for speaking ill of the DPRK's proposal for 
reunification through a confederacy in view of the current Yemen 
situation. 
  In an article on the civil war in Yemen the Japanese SANKEI 
SHIMBUN wrote that on the Korean peninsula, too, a confederacy 
in which the North and the South are supposed to be reunified 
without political integration while leaving their systems as 
they are, is unstable and it may lead to a war. And the South 
Korean newspaper CHOSUN ILBO reported that reunification through 
a confederacy is as good as promising a bloodlet through a civil 
war later. 
  These arguments of some Japanese and South Korean media are 
a 
sinister jargon to defend the sophism of the separatists within 
and without, create obstacles in the way of Korea's 
reunification and incite division and confrontation, the news 
analyst says, and goes on: 
  The cause of the civil war in Yemen rather testifies more 
clearly to the validity and reasonableness of the DPRK's 
confederacy formula. 
  The confederacy formula calls for the establishment of a 
national unified state on the basis of patriotism and the idea 
of national independence and on the principle of promoting 
co-existence, co- prosperity and common interests. 
  It provides an institutional guarantee of fairly 
distributing 
the functions and authority of the confederal government and 
regional governments and enabling the political forces 
participating in them to exercise equal rights, such as 
establishing above the regional governments a unified national 
government consisting of an equal number of people from both 
sides and the North and the South running it on a rotatory basis. 
  It also envisages organizing a United National Army through 
a 
drastic reduction of the armies of the North and the South and 
their amalgamation and placing it under the unified command of 
the confederal government, thus providing a military arrangement 
so that the fear of invasion from both South and North and the 
ideas of prevailing over communism and communization may be 
dispelled and a durable peace be preserved. 
  The proposal of achieving national reunification through a 
confederacy on the basis of one nation, one state, two systems 
and two governments is the most just and feasible programme 
which makes it possible to achieve the reunification of the 
country independently and peacefully at the earliest possible 
date without neither side conquering the other or being 
conquered under the conditions where different ideas and systems 
exist in the North and the South of Korea. 
  The process of reunification in Yemen is fundamentally 
different from DPRK-proposed reunification through a confederacy 
in the principles, ways and content of reunification. It is 
motivated by their sinister political aim that they are speaking 
ill of the DPRK's confederacy formula by connecting it with the 
incident in Yemen in a far-fetched manner, without so much as a 
study of it. 
  The Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean puppets have 
desperately tried to block peace and reunification of the Korean 
peninsula, objecting to the DPRK's proposal for reunification 
through a confederacy, in order to perpetuate the division of 
Korea. The slander of some Japanese and South Korean media on 
the DPRK's reunification proposal represents the real intention 
of the dishonest force seeking to perpetuate the division. 
  It is a disgraceful behavior like tarnishing one's own image 
by himself for the press which regards justice and truth as what 
keeps it alive to play into the hands of the separatists opposed 
to peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula.

<F P=106> ["Foreign Ministry Spokesman on Russia Visit of Foreign </F>
Ministry Delegation" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the DPRK 
Foreign Ministry, answering a question put by KCNA today 
concerning the recent visit of a delegation of the Foreign 
Ministry to the Russian Federation, said: 
  A delegation led by a vice foreign minister visited the 
Russian Federation in mid-May under the plan of exchange between 
the Foreign Ministries of the two countries. 
  During its visit, the delegation met and had talks and 
conversations with senior officials of the Foreign Ministry of 
Russia. 
  At the talks and conversations, the Russian side manifested 
its willingness to value the traditional relations between the 
two countries and more actively develop these relations in 
political, economic and other fields in the future. 
  The Russian side mentioned the issues of holding frequent 
political consultations and parliamentary contacts between the 
two countries over peace and security in the Far East, starting 
the work of the intergovernmental economic and 
scientific-technological consultative committee, developing the 
economic relations between the DPRK and the Far Eastern region 
and Siberia of Russia, letting Russia actively participate in 
the development of the Rajin-Sonbong free trade and economic 
zone and concluding a new forestry agreement in a short time 
because cooperation in forestry is beneficial to both sides. 
  As regards the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, the 
Russian side resolutely opposed all manner of threat and 
pressure and contended that this issue must be settled strictly 
by political means. 
  It expressed understanding of the DPRK's position to resolve 
the nuclear issue through DPRK-USA talks and hoped for an early 
success at the DPRK-USA talks. 
  The Russian side proposed multi-party talks for the 
establishment of security on a wider range including the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula and expressed its view that the 
talks would be favorable for the countries concerned to have a 
correct stand. 
  The Russian side said it opposes attempts to establish 
domination and respects the interests among nations and the 
freedom of choice of peoples. 
  The delegations of the Foreign Ministries of the two 
countries expressed satisfaction with the results of the talks 
and conversations and expressed their willingness to continue 
regular consultations in the future.

  [Text] An international conference on lifting the unjust 
blockade on Iraq opened its meetings yesterday in the Malaysian 
capital, Kuala Lumpur. The conference is organized by 
governmental figures and organizations under the patronage of 
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamed. 
  Abdul Ghani bin Othman, the Malaysian minister of youth and 
sports and representative of the Malaysian prime minister, 
delivered a speech at the conference. He asserted that there 
are no longer any justifications for the blockade, noting the 
need for the international community and the United Nations to 
work honestly to end the injustice done to Iraq. 
  The Malaysian prime minister's representative also conveyed 
the prime minister's greetings to the leadership and patient, 
steadfast people of Iraq. 
  Latif Nusayyif Jasim, the chairman of the [Iraqi] 
Friendship, 
Peace, and Solidarity Organization, gave a speech in which he 
said that Iraq was chosen as a target of aggression for many 
reasons, primarily because it represents the impregnable eastern 
gate of the Arab nation. He added that Iraq enjoys significant 
political, economic, and military weight and has a policy that 
is independent from the Western octopus. This is in addition to 
the fact that it champions the causes and aspirations of Third 
World nations, and all other nations that care about their 
independence and sovereignty. 
  He added that the reasons cited by the influential states at 
the Security Council to maintain the unjust blockade against our 
people are gone. Iraq has fulfilled all its obligations toward 
these resolutions, particularly Resolution 687, Paragraph 22, 
which stipulates that Iraq is free to export its oil and have 
trade and commercial transactions and exchange goods with the 
world. 
  Latif Nusayyif Jasim added that the UN Special Commission 
has 
corroborated the fact that Iraq has fulfilled its obligations. 
He added that after Iraq implemented its commitments per 
Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 and in view of its cooperation 
with UN committees, some permanent members of the Security 
Council are now highlighting the need to lift this inhuman 
blockade. In addition, there are thousands of governmental and 
nongovernmental figures and organizations that call for ending 
the suffering of the people of Iraq as a result of the blockade 
that has persisted for far too long, since there are no longer 
any justifications for it.

  [Text] Yesterday [28 May], a spokesman of the DPRK Foreign 
Ministry gave the following answer to questions posed by a KCNA 
reporter in connection with the working-level negotiations held 
recently between us and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA]: 
  Working-level negotiations were held between us and the IAEA 
in Pyongyang from 25 to 27 May on the question of the 
replacement of fuel rods at the five-megawatt experimental 
atomic power plant. 
  What was basically [kibonuro] discussed at the negotiations 
was the method of preserving the technical possibilities of the 
measurement of spent fuel rods by the IAEA in case we undergo 
routine and ad hoc inspections after a package solution to the 
nuclear issue between Korea and the United States is found in 
the future. 
  As has been reported, we are replacing the fuel rods in a 
unique status following the temporary suspension of the 
effectuation of our withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty. Under such circumstances, we cannot allow routine and 
ad hoc inspections by the agency. But, we have clarified our 
stance of good will for fully ensuring the continuity of 
safeguards corresponding to our unique status and for replacing 
fuel rods in such a way as to preserve even technical 
possibilities of selected measurement of fuel rods in the future. 
  The United States, the main [kibon] party concerned with the 
solution of the nuclear issue, also appraised this as 
encouraging and expressed to us the hope that its method would 
be discussed with the IAEA. 
  At the negotiations, the agency, first of all, raised the 
method of selected and separated preservation of fuel rods. 
But, an understanding was reached between the two sides that it 
was not acceptable in principle because this was essentially an 
inspection activity falling under the category of ad hoc 
inspections and going beyond our unique status. 
  Hence, the negotiations focussed on the reasonableness of 
the 
method we are applying to the replacement of fuel rods. 
  Our side earnestly explained that this is an appropriate 
method of sufficiently ensuring technical possibilities of 
freely measuring selected fuel rods as demanded by the agency by 
the time when our unique status is dissolved in the future, 
while guaranteeing the continuity of safeguards in conformity 
with our unique status at the present stage. 
  And we also ensured all conditions for the agency delegates 
to go down to the spot and confirm the conditions and work there 
and have sufficient technical consultations with the operators 
of the facilities while the negotiations were under way, thereby 
helping them have a clear understanding of the reasonableness of 
our-style method. 
  The agency side took note of the fact that this method of 
ours is theoretically feasible and that it has already been 
experimentally confirmed, and requested us to arrange its 
content in writing, saying that the agency side would study with 
prudence [sinjunghage] the efficiency and practical safeguards 
of our-style method with good will. 
  We stressed that though this method will enlarge a little 
the 
amount of measurement, it is the only way for us to adopt under 
the present conditions in which political restrictions exist. 
We guaranteed [tambohayotta] that we would continue the 
replacement of fuel rods in such a way as to accept a series of 
opinions of the agency side concerning this method and would 
respond any time to the agency side's future proposals for 
holding negotiations. 
  At the negotiations, a final agreement was not reached on 
our- style method, but this method was further supplemented and 
perfected through the process of negotiations. We immediately 
applied this method to the replacement of fuel rods so that the 
possibility of future selected measurement of fuel rods could be 
more fully preserved, and we are also placing the process of all 
work process under a strict supervision of the agency inspectors 
and monitoring [kamsi] equipment of the agency. 
  We acknowledge that through the negotiations with the IAEA 
side and the monitoring [iphoe] activities of the agency 
concerning the replacement of fuel rods of this time, our good 
will to place the peaceful nuclear activities thoroughly under 
the control of the agency was manifested to the maximum. 
  In the future, too, we will make active efforts to ensure 
the 
transparency of our nuclear activities and do everything to find 
an ultimate [chonggukjok] solution to the nuclear issue through 
the Korea-U.S. talks.

  [Text] Seoul, May 28 (YONHAP) -- Three of the five 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] officials currently in 
North Korea will leave the country Saturday after negotiations 
collapsed on the terms of the IAEA monitoring the North's 
unloading of spent fuel rods from the controversial Yongbyon 
nuclear reactor, diplomatic sources here said. 
  "The negotiations broke down because the North proceeded 
with 
the replacement of spent fuel rods, ignoring the IAEA request to 
stop withdrawing them," said the sources. "Accordingly, three 
out of the five IAEA officials in North Korea will pull out of 
Pyongyang today." 
  The sources, however, said two inspectors would remain in 
North Korea to witness the work of discharging spent fuel rods 
at the Yongbyon reactor.

<F P=106> [By Yi Tong-min] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, May 28 (YONHAP) -- The North Korean nuclear 
dispute became a life-or-death situation Saturday with Seoul 
officials conceding the virtual failure of 
Pyongyang-International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) negotiations. 
  IAEA Director-general Hans Blix reported to the U.N. 
Security 
Council that North Korea could finish unloading nuclear fuel 
rods within days and thus destroy the chances of measuring what 
went on at the 5-megawatt reactor during the past eight years of 
operation. 
  The IAEA, the United States and South Korea have made clear 
that if such measurement was not guaranteed, they would seek 
countermeasures through the U.N. Security Council. The Security 
Council already held informal consultation Friday evening and 
will meet again early next week to discuss the situation based 
on Blix's report. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu chaired a hastily called 
meeting of vice and assistant ministers and his nuclear 
negotiating team to discuss the latest report from Vienna. 
Officials said the IAEA is likely to issue a final statement 
sometime in the morning from Vienna. If the agency judges that 
the chances of future measurement are ruined, it is certain to 
request action by the Security Council. 
  The officials were clinging to the little hope that 
remained, 
saying two of the five IAEA inspectors currently in Pyongyang 
will stay behind and monitor the progress in the discharge of 
fuel rods from North Korea's 5-megawatt reactor. 
  These inspectors could restart negotiations with North Korea 
on halting the unloading process so that the IAEA can select and 
store the critical rods for future measurement. Measurement is 
considered a must in determining how much plutonium North Korea 
has stockpiled. "But it's definitely closer to a failure," said 
one ministry official on condition of anonymity. "As to whether 
the remaining inspectors can succeed in negotiations, we can't 
be sure." 
  North Korea began discharging the 800 bundles of fuel rods, 
each bundle containing 10 rods, from May 12. According to Blix, 
Pyongyang has done 50 percent of the unloading and will be able 
to complete the job within days. 
  Washington, in working-level contacts with Pyongyang over 
the 
past few days, has insisted that North Korea at least stop the 
discharge. This would ensure that there was still a chance of 
taking the necessary measurements. But North Korea has refused 
to halt the work, demanding instead that the United States sit 
down for the next round of high-level negotiations to discuss 
how measurement can be guaranteed, apparently a tactic to 
continue using the 5- megawatt reactor as a bargaining chip. 
  "North Korea never said it would not allow measurement. But 
it's becoming obvious that Pyongyang is doing its best to keep 
its past nuclear activities a secret, away from any analysis or 
probe," said one analyst at the Foreign Ministry. 
  In truth, full access to the fuel rods and their measurement 
would disclose the majority of North Korea's nuclear development 
program, and giving it away would dramatically weaken 
Pyongyang's nuclear card. 
  Foreign Minister Han had repeated that guaranteeing 
measurement is "the line" that decides whether diplomatic 
efforts continue or end. North Korea is close to crossing that 
line and officials say that by next week, new circumstances may 
arise that demand a confrontation with Pyongyang.

  [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu began consultations with major allies' envoys Monday on 
the North Korean nuclear crisis, meeting first with U.S. 
Ambassador James Laney. 
  Han, returning from an inter-ministerial security 
coordination meeting at the presidential office, asked Laney to 
come to the Foreign Ministry, officials said. 
  The move is part of instructions from President Kim Yong-sam 
to consult with the four major countries involved -- the United 
States, Japan, Russia and China -- as the U.N. Security Council 
prepares to meet Tuesday to discuss action against North Korea. 
  He is expected to emphasize that now is the critical time in 
dealing with the nuclear dispute, noting that North Korea is 
clearly in violation of the safeguards agreement with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  Han and Laney are expected to agree on coordinated action at 
the United Nations in a last-minute attempt to get North Korea 
to stop unloading spent fuel from its reactor, while also 
agreeing that stringent measures are inevitable otherwise.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa said Friday [27 May] that no formal deadline has been 
fixed for conclusion of "framework" trade negotiations with the 
United States, set for resumption after a three-month deadlock. 
  Kakizawa, responding to questions before the House of 
Representatives Budget Committee, said it is nevertheless 
desirable that the talks be brought to an early conclusion. 
  The foreign minister said he confirmed the absence of a 
deadline in a recent telephone conversation with U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor. 
  But Kantor has reportedly suggested bilateral talks on 
government procurement be wound up by the end of June, while 
negotiations in other sectors should be concluded before the end 
of September, when the U.S. administration is scheduled to 
decide whether to invoke the Super 301 trade provision that 
permits sanctions against countries allegedly practicing unfair 
trade. 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata told the committee that Japan 
would take recourse to arbitration in the framework of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) if Washington opts 
for sanctions.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
will hold working group meetings in Tokyo from next week to 
discuss government procurement areas of the bilateral trade 
"framework" talks, a top Foreign Ministry official said Monday. 
  The working group meeting on telecommunications equipment 
will be held June 3-4 and the meeting on medical equipment will 
be held June 7-8 in Tokyo, the official said. 
  Japan and the U.S. agreed last week to resume the trade 
framework talks after a three-month deadlock. The trade 
negotiations have been stalled since February due to differences 
over the definition of "objective criteria." Japan has strongly 
refused U.S. demands to set numerical targets to measure 
progress in the opening of the Japanese market.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
predicted Tuesday [31 May] that trade talks between Japan and 
the United States will make headway if the two economic 
superpowers strive to seek a common basis over the future course 
of their trade relations. 
  "I am sure things will move in a favorable direction," the 
premier said at the Japan National Press Club, referring to the 
prospects for the bilateral "framework" trade talks to be 
resumed Wednesday after a three-month stalemate. 
  Hata, who became premier in April, said he and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton agree their countries can better 
understand each other through in-depth talks. 
  Tokyo and Washington announced last week they have reached a 
compromise to reopen the protracted trade talks to set up a new 
framework for bilateral trade. 
  The trade negotiations, which are aimed at widening U.S. 
access to Japanese markets, ruptured in February after Tokyo 
rejected U.S. proposals to use numerical targets in gauging 
progress in Japanese imports. 
  In resuming the framework talks, the two countries agreed to 
use two or more "objective criteria" in measuring progress in 
opening Japanese markets and paring down Japan's massive trade 
surplus. 
  On North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development program, 
the 58-year-old Hata said Tokyo is not sure whether the 
communist state already possesses nuclear warheads. 
  He also expressed hope Pyongyang will "truly open up its 
heart to the international community" and dispel allegations 
that it is developing a nuclear weapons capability. 
  As Japan's colonial rule over the Korean peninsula caused 
unbearable suffering and sorrow for the people living in both 
North and South Korea, the premier said, Tokyo is ready to 
cooperate with Pyongyang in promoting public welfare in the 
country. 
  If North Korea keeps on refusing full international checks 
at 
its nuclear sites, it will result in a catastrophic situation, 
he warned. 
  While saying Japan will act in step with the United Nations 
in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, Hata reiterated it 
will do so within the bounds of the Constitution that bans the 
use of force in settling international disputes.

  [Text] Beijing, May 28 (YONHAP) -- Negotiations between the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and North Korea over 
safeguards on nuclear facilities in the communist country 
failed, Demitri Perricos, safeguards director at the UN nuclear 
watchdog, said here Saturday. 
  Perricos and one other IAEA senior envoy sent to Pyongyang 
to 
discuss possible measurements of fuel rods unloaded from an 
experimental 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon nuclear compound on 
Tuesday, arrived in Beijing together with the chief of IAEA team 
that conducted inspections in nuclear reprocessing facilities 
since may 17. 
  The procedures proposed by North Korea were insufficient for 
IAEA to determine safeguards of the nuclear facilities and the 
talks ended in failure because the stalinist country refused the 
UN body's demand to stop unilateral unloading of the fuel rods, 
calling it political restriction, Perricos said. 
  He said North Koreans refused to accept nuclear safeguards, 
admitting that IAEA and Pyongyang failed to narrow differences 
over lasting safeguards measures such as by regular and ad hoc 
inspections. 
  The senior IAEA official was, however, cautious in 
forecasting the failure in talks could lead to sanctions against 
North Korea, saying it was up to the United Nations to decide. 
  He said he told North Koreans that talks could be resumed if 
they wanted to. 
  Perricos said his team had sent short report on the results 
of talks with North Korea and nuclear inspections to the IAEA 
headquarters on Friday, but added that he didn't know whether 
IAEA Director-General Hans Blix reported the results to the UN 
Security Council. 
  He said the final report would be submitted at the IAEA 
headquarters when they arrive in Vienna.

  [Text] Seoul, May 28 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government expressed deep concern and regret Saturday over the 
virtual failure of negotiations between North Korea and the 
International Atomic energy agency (IAEA) over refueling at the 
5-megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon complex. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho urged North Korea to 
immediately stop unloading fuel rods and accept the IAEA's 
requests. 
  "We strongly request North Korea, as a member of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, faithfully abide by nuclear safeguards 
obligations," he said. 
  He warned that if North Korea continues with unloading 
process as to kill chances of measurements, the situation can 
only turn critical. 
  Chang observed that the immediate discussions at the UN 
Security Council after IAEA director-general's report was very 
appropriate. 
  He added that Seoul will continue to exert all diplomatic 
efforts in consultations with its allies to stop North Korea 
from further unloading of nuclear fuel rods and make it accept 
IAEA's requests.

  [Text] Berlin, May 28 (YONHAP) -- International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) negotiators failed to reach an agreement 
with North Korea to determine whether the communist country is 
developing nuclear arms and are returning to the headquarters in 
Vienna, IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said Saturday. 
  Pyongyang continues to remove fuel rods and chances of more 
talks between the UN nuclear safeguards body and North Korea are 
little although IAEA is willing to resume negotiations, Meyer 
said. 
  He said North Korea refused all proposals by IAEA to verify 
whether diversion of fuel took place in the past and that this 
week's talks in Pyongyang broke down without reaching any 
agreement. 
  IAEA delegates asked various proposals to select, segregate, 
and secure fuel standards to verify the reactor core is the 
original one installed in 1986, but North Korea refused every 
one of them, the spokesman said in a statement. 
  North Koreans referred to their "unique status" -- a formula 
by which they can pick and choose which international safeguards 
measures to respect -- and held fast to its opposition to IAEA's 
activities to determine whether nuclear fuel has been diverted 
to a secret weapons program. 
  They instead offered some of their ideas, but IAEA turned 
them down because they were not "adequate and verifiable" to 
determine past operation. 
  Of five negotiators, two have remained in Yongbyon to report 
the process of unloading to headquarters, which means safeguards 
are not completely broken down. 
  The IAEA Secretariat has reported these facts to the board 
of 
governors and United Nations Security Council, the statement 
said. 
  Meyer said the UN nuclear watchdog is still willing to talk 
with Pyongyang, but that the matter was entirely up to North 
Koreans. He, however, added that he saw little hope in further 
talks.

  [Text] On the morning of 31 May, the government held a 
coordination meeting on reunification and security-related 
policies under the chairmanship of Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime 
minister and minister of the National Unification Board, at the 
South-North talks Secretariat in Samchong-tong. Discussions 
were held on the government's measures against the North Korean 
nuclear issue which faces a serious crisis due to the failure in 
the negotiations between the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] and North Korea. Following is a report by Kim Chol-min. 
  [Begin Kim Chol-min recording] Today, the government decided 
to actively promote sanctions against the North based on the 
international cooperation system if North Korea does not accept 
the separation and storage of the fuel rods at its five-megawatt 
atomic reactor in Yongbyon by 6 June, the date slated for the 
IAEA Board of Governors meeting. In accordance with President 
Kim Yong-sam's yesterday's order to come up with a 
countermeasure according to each situation of the North Korean 
nuclear issue, the government held a coordination meeting on 
reunification and security-related policies and discussed this 
matter today. 
  The government confirmed that it will not stop its efforts 
to 
continue to hold dialogue with North Korea until 6 June. In 
particular, the government decided that if North Korea does not 
accept the IAEA's demand, even after a final warning is sent to 
North Korea through a resolution stronger than the UN Security 
Council presidential statement adopted by the United Nations 
today, it will strongly convey to the United States the 
inevitability of carrying out sanctions against the North at the 
UN Security Council level. 
  Along with this, the government discussed ways to deal with 
China, which might exercise a veto when voting on a resolution 
on sanctions by the UN Security Council. It also decided to 
actively encourage China's participation, and examine the 
possibility of taking sanctions focusing on allies such as the 
United States and Japan, aside from the UN Security Council.

  [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- The government is 
preparing for every possible contingency following the breakdown 
of negotiations between North Korea and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  President Kim Yong-sam presided over a security-related 
cabinet ministers' meeting Monday morning to discuss various 
means of coping with the nuclear dispute. 
  The government decided to strengthen cooperation with the 
countries around the Korean peninsula -- the United States, 
Japan, China and Russia -- and study possible action in case the 
issue is referred to the U.N. Security Council, presidential 
press secretary Choo Don-shik said. 
  It was also decided to convey South Korea's position agreed 
at the meeting to the Governments of the United States, Japan, 
China and Russia, Choo said. 
  Attending the meeting were Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok, 
Deputy 
Premier and minister of the National Unification Board (NUB) Yi 
Hong-ku, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Defense Minister Yi 
Pyoung- tae and other ministers and secretaries. 
  President Kim said, "The efforts of the government and the 
international society to peacefully solve the North Korean 
nuclear problem are faced with a grave challenge as Pyongyang 
ignored the international society's demands and pushed for 
replacement of fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon." 
  Kim instructed the ministers to prepare for any emergency 
which might be created by North Korea in a crisis. 
  President Kim urged North Korea to immediately stop 
discharging the fuel rods, saying that selection, storage and 
measurement of fuel rods are indispensable to securing the 
transparency of past nuclear activities as well as ascertaining 
the non-diversion of nuclear material. 
  Kim instructed the ministers to maintain close cooperation 
with related countries to achieve tangible results and to work 
out countermeasures for every possibility, including referral of 
the nuclear issue to the Security Council again. 
  The government, however, decided to continue trying to solve 
the problem through dialogue ahead of the IAEA's regular Board 
of Governors' meeting slated for June 6, since the nuclear 
dispute cannot be considered a catastrophe as Pyongyang still 
wants to hold a third round of high-level talks with Washington, 
according to the official. 
  "The results of today's meeting will be conveyed to related 
countries including the United States," Choo said. 
  The government plans to hold a unification and security 
policy coordination meeting this week to draw up detailed 
measures on the basis of the results of the security-related 
ministers' meeting.

  [Text] Seoul, May 29 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
said Saturday prospects for further talks between North Korea 
and the United States were unclear due to Pyongyang's unilateral 
discharge of nuclear fuel rods and that the matter could now be 
referred to the UN Security Council [UNSC], leading to sanctions 
against the communist country. 
  In talks with the opposition Democratic Party (DP) leader Yi 
Ki- taek, Kim said of 8,000 existing fuel rods, North Korea 
changed 4,000 and their whereabouts were unknown and that the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections had hit a 
deadlock. 
  "Therefore prospects for the North Korea-U.S. high-level 
talks, slated for June, are unclear and after IAEA report, the 
nuclear issue is expected to be referred to the UNSC," Yi quoted 
Kim as saying. 
  Kim also told Yi that when referred to UNSC, both military 
and economic sanctions could be imposed together and that China, 
under these circumstances, could no longer oppose. 
  Yi said the president will endeavour to kill the North 
Korea- 
Russia military treaty, which obliges Russia to side with North 
Korea in case of a war on the Korean peninsula. 
  Kim also said the government had several scenarios preparing 
for the unpredictable North Korean situation, Yi said.

  [Text] A tense situation has reached a climax surrounding 
the nuclear issue with the break in the negotiations with North 
Korea on the nuclear fuel rods. In this connection, the 
government plans to request the United Nations to actively 
pressure North Korea to change its attitude. 
  A government authority said that the Chinese Government will 
not be able to oppose the principle that North Korea must reveal 
the actual condition of the past nuclear developments by 
accepting the inspection of its fuel rods. He said that since 
the Chinese Government's position will also be difficult if the 
North Korean issue is discussed on a full-scale at the United 
Nations, it is expected that the Chinese Government will play an 
active role as mediator to induce North Korea to change its 
attitude. 
  He also said that there is still some room for resolving 
this 
issue through dialogue, but warned that if North Korea makes it 
so that the actual condition of the past nuclear developments 
cannot be examined because it replaces its fuel rods, 
discussions will be held for taking sanctions immediately at the 
UN level.

  [Text] The UN Security Council [UNSC] had planned to hold 
an emergency countermeasure meeting to discuss North Korea's 
nuclear issue early this morning [Korean time]. It is reported, 
however, that because the individual countries had not 
fined-tuned their position, they agreed to hold a meeting on 
Tuesday, 31 May, after making informal contacts between member 
countries. 
  The UNSC member countries had planned to convene an 
emergency 
countermeasure meeting today, Sunday, with a view to hastily 
adopting a statement of warning or a resolution pointing out the 
seriousness of the situation to North Korea which has been 
making haste in replacing fuel rods more than necessary. 
  But, there is a prevailing opinion that it will take more 
time to fine-tune the opinions of not only permanent members, 
but of other members as well and that it is desirable to further 
watch the attitude of the North Korean side. As a result, 
well-informed sources have said that it was agreed among member 
countries to hold a countermeasure meeting this upcoming 31 May. 
  In today's informal contacts between UNSC members, the U.S. 
side asked China to exercise a strong influence on North Korea 
to immediately stop replacing fuel rods. The Great Britain and 
France advocated adopting a statement calling again for holding 
negotiations between the International Atomic Energy Agency and 
North Korea while sending out a warning about the seriousness of 
the present situation. But, it is reported that the Chinese 
stressed the need to deal with this question with prudence as 
well as to have dialogue with North Korea with patience.

  [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government welcomes the U.N. Security Council [UNSC] president's 
statement on North Korea Tuesday with a warning to Pyongyang 
that it is headed toward confrontation with the entire 
international community. 
  "The government of the Republic of Korea wholeheartedly 
supports (the statement) as an appropriate action," Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said in a statement. 
  The 15-member Security Council issued a presidential 
statement urging North Korea to comply with International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) requirements in discharging fuel rods from 
its nuclear reactor. 
  "The adoption of this Security Council presidential 
statement 
is a declaration of the firm and unified will of the 
international community on the North Korean nuclear problem," 
the spokesman said. "We warn that North Korea must realize the 
unfortunate reality that it is inviting confrontation with the 
entire international community and that it not turn the matter 
into a more serious situation by immediately accepting the 
demands of the international community." 
  The government is once again pressing North Korea to halt 
the 
rod unloading process and accept the required IAEA safeguards, 
the spokesman said.

  [Text] On 31 May North Korea sternly expressed the 
intention of refusing to accept [suyong kobu uisaul pyomyong 
haessumnida] the UN Security Council presidential statement. 
After the UN Security Council formal meeting ended today, Kim 
Su-man, deputy ambassador to the North Korean mission to the 
United Nations, said: This statement is another attempt by the 
United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
to stifle North Korea and, therefore, it is refused. 
  Deputy Ambassador Kim Su-man stressed that all pending 
issues 
must be resolved through talks with the United States, not by 
the UN Security Council, and said: North Korea is, however, 
willing to hold further negotiations with the IAEA. 
  He added that although North Korea has made efforts to 
reasonably solve the problems, the IAEA has refused the North 
Korean proposal.

  [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- Chances are high that the 
UN Security Council will approve and actually impose sanctions 
against North Korea if the nuclear standoff continues on its 
present course, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Tuesday. 
  Without going into detail, Han said the Seoul government has 
prepared measures "for every possible situation." 
  China, the uncertain variable if the council does opt for 
sanctions, could play an important role regardless of whether it 
joins in the sanctions, he said. 
  Han, who is accompanying President Kim Yong-sam on a state 
visit to Russia June 1, said he hopes Seoul and Moscow will 
reaffirm their cooperation in resolving the North Korean nuclear 
row. 
  Kim leaves for Russia in the midst of a tense situation, 
with 
North Korea refusing core inspection activities at a disputed 5- 
megawatt reactor that could reveal its past nuclear development. 
  Han had said that Pyongyang would be crossing the line if it 
destroyed the opportunity for the IAEA [International Atomic 
Energy Agency] to segregate and sample fuel rods from the 
reactor for later measurement. 
  "If the fuel rod discharging work continues at the current 
pace, North Korea will, in a short while, cross that line," he 
said in a press conference at the Foreign Ministry. But Seoul 
has not been informed that Pyongyang actually crossed the line, 
said Han. 
  Asked about the possibility of the Security Council opting 
for sanctions, he said the "chances are high that sanctions will 
actually be put into effect." 
  "But it's not the time to discuss military sanctions," Han 
said, despite President Kim's earlier remarks in talks with the 
opposition leader that economic and military sanctions may be 
sought simultaneously. 
  "We are not ruling out any possibility," he said when asked 
if Seoul is willing to seek sanctions outside the Security 
Council in case China refuses to go along. 
  Predicting China's role will grow as the Security Council 
discusses whether to impose sanctions, he suggested other ways 
for Beijing to exert influence. "China would be able to assume 
various important roles, regardless of whether it does or does 
not participate actively in the sanctions," he said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the United 
States jointly expressed concern Monday that the North Korean 
nuclear row has become more serious and volatile than ever 
before. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. Ambassador to Seoul 
James Laney met in the morning soon after President Kim Yong-sam 
chaired a national security session. 
  Han briefed Laney on what was discussed at the meeting and 
called for even closer cooperation in dealing with the latest 
crisis stemming from Pyongyang's nuclear program, especially as 
President Kim leaves for Russia Wednesday. 
  "The two countries shared the view that the North Korean 
nuclear problem is entering its most serious stage and that the 
present situation is extremely worrisome," Ministry spokesman 
Chang Ki-ho said. 
  "They reconfirmed the principle that in order for dialogue 
to 
continue, North Korea must keep alive the basis for such 
dialogue -- that is, the opportunity to sample, secure and 
measure the fuel rods from the North Korean nuclear reactor must 
not be damaged," he said. 
  The U.N. Security Council convenes Tuesday to address 
Pyongyang's latest refusal to keep this opportunity alive. The 
council is expected to adopt a presidential statement or even a 
resolution pressing North Korea to reach agreement with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on guaranteeing the 
sampling and measurement of the rods.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Last Tricks of the North Korean Nuclear </F>
Issue"] 
  [Text] The North Korean nuclear issue approaches a crisis 
once again. This is because North Korea has begun changing fuel 
rods at its nuclear reactor by ignoring the International Atomic 
Energy Agency's [IAEA] request for safety steps regarding the 
replacement of fuel rods. 
  Such dogmatic behavior by North Korea is a challenge that 
will throw a wet blanket on efforts by the ROK, the United 
States, and the United Nations to peacefully settle the North 
Korean nuclear issue. Accordingly, the UN Security Council will 
give, sooner or later, a warning to North Korea in the name of 
its president or adopt a statement condemning North Korea 
regarding its replacement of fuel rods. Also, it will discuss 
sanctions against North Korea. Such being the situation, the 
government naturally convened a meeting of security-related 
ministers, defined the present situation as "a serious 
situation," and decided to hurry in preparing against North 
Korea's sudden action." 
  As soon as a third round of U.S.-North Korean talks seemed 
imminent, North Korea turned their back from the international 
community and suddenly began changing fuel rods at a 5-megawatt 
nuclear reactor in Yongbyon. The replacement of nuclear fuel 
rods is the last key to uncovering the suspected nuclear 
development by North Korea. This is because we can confirm if 
North Korea has extracted plutonium, the raw material for 
manufacturing nuclear weapons, from the spent fuel rods or 
converted it to manufacture nuclear bombs. Accordingly, the 
IAEA offered to analyze fuel rods after random selection and 
separate preservation to confirm North Korea's claims that the 
core rods [nosim] have not been removed since operations began 
in 1986, but North Korea rejected this by citing "their unique 
status" of having delayed their decision to withdraw from the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It has been learned that North 
Korea has already removed and is now preserving approximately 
4,000 rods out of the 8,010 rods from the nuclear reactor. 
  We can point out several reasons why North Korea has begun 
replacing fuel rods despite the fact that they are well aware 
that international community would impose sanctions or pressure 
against them, and that they would face destruction: First, this 
is to hide the amount of plutonium they have so far extracted 
from the spent fuel rods; second, technologically, they could no 
longer put off the replacement of fuel rods; and third, this can 
be regarded as a strategy to gain something more from the United 
States during the third round of U.S.-North Korean high level 
talks. Neither can we overlook the fact that North Korea seems 
especially intent on acting this way in order to control their 
people, who are agitated over the serious food shortage or 
economic difficulties, by creating more tension on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  While recklessly taking a hardline attitude regarding the 
nuclear issue, North Korea has strongly insisted on holding 
talks with the United States. This is attracting people's 
attention. A spokesman of North Korean Foreign Ministry said on 
28 May that "the DPRK will make every effort to ultimately 
resolve the nuclear issue during talks with the United States." 
Also, the Korea Central News Agency stressed that the DPRK 
"will accept overall inspections [chonmyon sachal] of nuclear 
facilities in Yongbyon if the United States agrees to settlement 
of the nuclear issue through a package deal." 
  Anyway, we can no longer overlook North Korea's last game 
with fire regarding the nuclear issue. The government needs to 
clearly realize that there is a limit to our position regarding 
the principle of peacefully resolving the nuclear issue and of 
accepting North Korea as the same fellow men. It must assume a 
stern attitude to lead North Korea to suspend replacing fuel 
rods at the nuclear reactor and to accept the IAEA's request for 
safety in the cooperation with the friendly countries, including 
the United States. It is also important to take a strong 
position so that the United States does not compromise with 
North Korea in a manner it may deem fit, merely for its 
diplomatic reputation. 
  If the UN Security Council imposes sanctions on North Korea 
one week from now according to the recommendation by the IAEA 
based on the final report of its Board of Governors, the 
government should actively participate in it and suspend 
exchange of manpower and goods with North Korea. Furthermore, 
it is needless to say that the government should prepare for the 
possible provocation by North Korea, which will have been thrown 
into a corner. 
  What is most important at present is the government's North 
Korean policy. Therefore, security-related officials should be 
united in dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue.

  [Text] Seoul, May 28 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam and 
opposition Democratic Party (DP) chairman Yi Ki-taek met for the 
second time this year Saturday, agreeing to hold summits often 
and establish a partnership between ruling and opposition 
parties to realize productive politics. 
  In talks that lasted some two and half hours, President Kim 
held forth on the North Korean nuclear dispute, the issue of 
North Koreans fleeing Siberian logging camps and the reality of 
the situation up North, asking for the DP's cooperation in 
diplomacy and inter-Korean issues. 
  Kim promised to instruct the government to fully cooperate 
with the National Assembly' activities within the legal boundary 
when the opposition leader called for the president's firm 
action to resolve the currently deadlocked house probe into the 
Sangmundae political scandal fund, presidential spokesman Chu 
Ton-sik said. 
  The president explained that North Korea already changed 
more 
than half of its 8,000 nuclear fuel rods and that recent talks 
with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) ended in failure. 
  He said it also was hard to predict what would happen to 
talks between the United States and North Korea, slated for June. 
  "More than 90 percent of North Korea's arms are Russian made 
and Russia automatically has to intervene when there is a war on 
the Korean peninsula. I'm going to specifically address these 
issues when I visit Russia," Kim said. 
  He added that Seoul informally proposed to offer some of its 
reserve rice to North Korea to resolve its food shortages, but 
the communist country refused. 
  The president urged the ruling and oppostion parties stop 
wasting energy disputing and instead carry out partnership for 
productive politics to raise national competitiveness, Chu said. 
  When Yi raised the issue of abolishing the National Security 
Law, Kim said the subcommittee formed by lawmakers for the the 
matter and legal experts should continue to discuss to reach a 
good conclusion, contrast to the president's flat opposition to 
the proposal in previous summit talks. 
  Explaining the inevitability of the birth of the world trade 
organization and Uruguay Round [UR] agreement, Kim sought the 
main opposition party's cooperation in the National Assembly's 
ratification of the UR agreement. 
  Yi, however, firmly answered that his party opposes to house 
ratification of the UR treaty. 
  When Yi called for a stop to inspections on Peace Foundation 
chairman Kim Tae-chung's house, the president promptly said such 
inspection activities could not be tolerated and should never 
exist, recalling his experience in the past as a opposition 
party leader. 
  After the talks, Yi announced that the president and he 
reached agreements in the issues of Sanmundae probe, revision of 
National Security Planning Law, investigation into Kwangju 
uprising, revision of unified medical insurance law, and reforms 
in educational and scientific policies. 
  "The president said North Korea had changed half of its 
8,000 
nuclear fuel rods and that the IAEA inspections had hit a 
deadlock. Prospects for the third North Korea-U.S. talks were, 
therefore, unclear and there was a possibility that the North 
Korean nuclear issue could be referred to the UN security 
council after hearing the IAEA report on its inspections," Yi 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 28 (YONHAP) -- U.S. reconnaissance 
satellites detected preparations by North Korea to test-launch a 
new missile about two weeks ago, the YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported in 
its Saturday editions. 
  Quoting military sources here who were informed of the 
North's movements by the United States Government, YOMIURI said, 
"there is a possibility North Korea would soon test-fire a 
second missile following the launch of the Nodong-I missile in 
the East Sea in may last year." 
  According to the YOMIURI report, many trucks, launchers and 
other vehicles have been sent to the detected launch site and 
vessels were swarming around ports along the east coast, 
apparently to determine the landing point of the missiles to be 
launched. 
  Asked why the North would try to test a new missile when the 
international community's attention is already focused on its 
suspected nuclear weapons program, the sources said, "the action 
seems to be timed with the warm seasonal weather conditions in 
the East Sea and we do not believe North Korea has any 
particular political intention of influencing nuclear 
negotiations." 
  The TOKYO SHIMBUN carried a similar story, quoting Foreign 
Ministry officials as saying that "we obtained information that 
North Korea is preparing to test-launch a missile in the East 
Sea." 
  The officials said the information had been supplied by the 
United States, adding, "the missile to be launched by the North 
this time appears to be a revised version of the Nodong-I 
missile," according to the TOKYO SHIMBUN. 
  "Washington and Pyongyang are likely to hold a third round 
of 
high-level talks soon, regardless of the attempt by the North to 
test-launch a missile," according to the officials, who hinted 
they had the impression that Washington considers the North's 
missile launch as a separate issue from the talks. 
  The North's Nodong-I that was test-launched in May last year 
has a range of 1,000 km.

  [Text] Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and minister of 
the National Unification Board, said on 27 May: It seems that, 
if North Korea possesses nuclear weapons, it will adhere to the 
so-called North Korean-style NCND [neither confirm nor deny] 
policy regarding its possession of nuclear weapons and its 
nuclear tests. 
  Deputy Prime Minsiter Yi said the above on 26 May in his 
written answer to Democratic Liberal Party lawmaker Namgung 
chin, member of the Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee of 
the National Assembly, who asked at the National Assembly that 
day "If North Korea possesses nuclear weapons, which policy 
would it choose, the Indian or the Pakistani-style?" 
  Deputy Prime Minister Yi said: "India openly confirms its 
nuclear tests and possession of nuclear weapons, while Pakistan 
does not." He then said: "I think North Korea will adhere to a 
not- confirm and not-opening policy." He added: "This is 
because North Korea still believes that it can use such a policy 
as an advantageous card in talks with the United States, Japan, 
and South Korea."

  [Text] Seoul, May 28 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu, calling North Korea an heir of sinic civilization, 
advised it Saturday to take after China and Vietnam and pursue 
economic restructuring. 
  "As Vietnam is learning from China, North Korea can and 
should learn from Vietnam," Han said in a luncheon address to an 
international workshop that opened here Friday. 
  "It should because that is the only way out of its present 
predicament," Han told participants in the workshop titled "the 
durability and direction of the four remaining socialist 
countries: China, Vietnam, Cuba and North Korea." 
  The sinic civilization, he said, is defined by Confucianism, 
Taoism, Buddhism and Chinese ideograms. This "cultural edge," 
as he called it, is what made Japan the world's second biggest 
economy and the Asian dragons the envy of developing countries, 
he said. 
  "What prevents Pyongyang from making the same choice as 
China 
and Vietnam? Perhaps its unique internal structure, such as its 
personality cult, and its presumed fear of the South may be the 
major causes," the foreign minister commented. 
  "On the other side of the ledger, however, Pyongyang should 
know that it possesses a very powerful tool for its survival, 
namely, its common sinic cultural heritage." 
  Whether North Korea chooses to learn from China and Vietnam 
will ultimately show in its attitude toward South Korea. But 
for now, Pyongyang chooses to depend on the United States. 
  "This relationship... can evolve either toward an economic 
embargo or gradual improvement," he said. "It can go either way, 
depending on Pyongyang's fateful choice regarding its nuclear 
program."

  [Text] Spurred by fears of war and anxiety over the 
possible collapse of the Kim Il-song regime, senior North Korean 
party, government and military officials are hoarding U.S. 
dollars, gold, jewelry and other valuables. 
  A persistent distrust in the local currency of the North, 
the 
won, is also driving the North Korean elite to convert their 
money into currency of capitalist nations or to buy up 
valuables, according to information filtering through from the 
North. 
  Pyongyang's leaders have been instilling a war mentality 
among their countrymen by boasting, "We will accomplish 
unification through the barrel of a gun." Of late, they have 
been putting ordinary citizens in fear by claiming that South 
Korea and the United States are about to invade the North 
because of the deadlocked nuclear row. 
  The Stalinist state's leaders have contributed further to 
the 
atmosphere of anxiety by ordering power blackouts and air raid 
exercises. As a result, many North Koreans apparently now 
believe that war will eventually break out on the peninsula. 
  One member of the pro-Pyongyang Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chochongnyon) who claims to know the 
commander of the Fourth North Korean Army Corps, identified only 
as Gen. Chang, said many North Koreans were buying U.S. dollars 
and Japanese yen from ethnic Koreans in China who trade goods 
across the border. Others are secretly amassing stores of gold, 
he said. 
  In particular, military generals like Chang are hording 
hundreds of thousands of dollars and gold ingots as large as 15 
cm long, 5 cm wide and 4 cm thick. Some are also hoarding 
pearls, gold necklaces, gold bracelets and ear-rings. 
  The Chochongnyon official said one of his relatives, 
identified only as An, a senior member of the Central Workers 
(Communist) Party in charge of agriculture, is hiding an 
unspecified amount of yen and jewelry. 
  NAEWOE PRESS, South Korea's official watcher of North Korean 
affairs, said another reason North Koreans are hoarding foreign 
currency and valuables was because of a possible, abrupt 
exchange of old bills with new ones like the swap carried out 
July 15, 1992. 
  At that time, the Pyongyang regime conducted a one-to-one 
exchange of old and new cash but limited the amount citizens 
could change, forcing them to deposit the excess at the central 
bank and other financial institutions. They were allowed to 
withdraw the deposited money under different regulations later 
on, NAEWOE said. The Pyongyang regime allowed individual 
households to exchange up to 399 won while depositing 30,000 won 
and no more. Because of this measure, many angry citizens burned 
the excess money they had saved or simply tossed the bills away.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 30 (YONHAP) -- South and North Korean 
companies have struck the largest single barter deal ever, under 
which the South will supply plastic products in exchange for 
Northern mineral water and alcoholic beverages, the president of 
the North Korean firm announced here Sunday. 
  Cha Kyong-chu, president of Korean Saemmul (well water) Co. 
of Pyongyang, said his firm has signed a 60-million-U.S.-dollar 
(500 million won) agreement with the Korea Plastic Industry 
Cooperative (KPIC). 
  The two sides are seeking approval for the deal from their 
respective governments, Cha said in an interview with YONHAP 
News Agency. 
  Under the agreement, the North Korean company will ship some 
30 million dollars worth of spring water, mineral water, soju 
and beer, all of which carry the "Shindok" brand name, to the 
South, Cha said. 
  The South Korean cooperative will supply plastic sheets used 
to build hothouses for agricultural produce, PVC pipes, and 
plastic wastebaskets, cups and water containers to the North, he 
said. 
  The North Korean products will be shipped from Nampo port on 
the west sea coast to Inchon, Pusan and Mokpo while South Korea 
will deliver its goods to Nampo from Inchon and Pusan aboard 
ships from a third country, Cha said. 
  Korean Saemmul Co. is a joint venture between Kenny Plastics 
Co. (Hong Kong) Ltd., a subsidiary of Kenny Plastics Corp. of 
the United States, and Korean Nungrado Trading Co. of North 
Korea. 
  Cha is an ethnic Korean-American. Korean Saemmul is the only 
North Korean company that exports mineral water produced in 
Shindok with government approval. Its products are sold in 
China and Hong Kong.

  [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- A North Korean has 
defected to South Korea aboard a vessel from a third country, 
the Agency for National Security Planning (NSP) announced Monday. 
  The agency said that Ho Chol, 23, arrived in Inchon last 
Saturday via a ship he boarded in North Korea and asked for 
asylum, which was accepted from a humanitarian standpoint. 
  The NSP is currently questioning Ho on his reasons for 
defecting. 
  A resident of Paekun-tong, Sinuiju, North Pyongan Province, 
Ho graduated from the city's Paekun Middle School and Pyongbuk 
Agricultural Mechanical High School. He then worked at an 
transportation office in Sinuiju before entering the Pyongyang 
light industry college, where he studied for six months until 
leaving in March 1992. 
  Ho left behind his parents and four brothers and sisters in 
North Korea, NSP sources said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- Ruling party Chairman Kim 
Chong-pil warned Monday that pro-Pyongyang elements in the South 
have been distributing printed materials praising Kim Il-song's 
chuche (self-reliance) ideology and glorifying the North's 
planned transfer of power to Kim's son, Chong-il. 
  Kim Chong-pil, from the ruling Democratic Liberal Party 
(DLP), told a meeting of senior party officials that a man who 
once served as an ambassador and now works in foreign relations 
gave him a small booklet last Saturday which had been sent to 
him. Kim later presented the booklet titled "21st Century and 
Leader". 
  "The contents of the booklet praise Kim Il-song's chuche 
ideology and stress that Kim Chong-il will play a greater role 
as leader (of the North) after assuming power from the great 
leader (Kim Il- song)," the DLP chairman said. "In particular, 
the phrases and words in the booklet are not ones used by the 
northerners but expressions we use here. The style of printing 
also seems not to belong to the North." 
  Accordingly, the booklet must have been printed here and 
then 
distributed, said Kim, advising the party to take action on the 
matter. 
  Kim criticized the attitude of law enforcement authorities, 
saying, "I heard from the man who passed the booklet on to me 
that policemen ignored him when he brought the booklet to a 
police box. I'm concerned about the police if they take such an 
attitude."

  [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- The country's political 
circles, shocked by the pro-communist line taken by Hanchongnyon 
(The Korea Federation of University Student Councils) at its 
three-day anniversary ceremony in Kwangju late last week, are 
moving to act against the group's pro-North Korean bent. 
  During the ceremony, the activist student organization 
issued 
pro-North Korean statements and called the Korean war "the war 
for fatherland liberation," echoing Pyongyang's definition of 
the conflict. 
  Worried about activist students' pro-North Korean bent when 
the Stalinist state's nuclear program has become the focal point 
of international concern, the political circles are urging the 
government to do something about the students. 
  The ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) expressed deep 
concern over Hanchongnyon's pro-communist line at a high-level 
meeting on Tuesday. Rep. Yi Se-ki, chairman of the policy 
committee, called the students' meeting "a worrying development" 
while giving a briefing on what happened in Kwangju. 
  Chairman Kim Chong-pil, unable to conceal his shock at the 
students' describing the Korean war as having been fought to 
liberate the fatherland, said, "They denounced our system and 
supported North Korea's communist system. 
  Other participants in the meeting were also surprised at the 
display of a miniature mockup of "the cultural palace of the 
people" in Pyongyang during the students' gathering in Kwangju. 
  Emerging from the meeting, spokesman Pak Pom-chin said, 
"communism has now become a tested legacy of history, and I 
can't understand how college students, as intellectuals, can 
call the Korean war the war for fatherland liberation, echoing 
the North Koreans' theory." He then called on the students to 
drop "the anachronistic behavior." 
  Secretary-general Mun Chong-su said, "I was told they put on 
display some miniature mockups of the house where Kim Il-song 
was born and the Cultural Palace of the people. What should I 
think of this display? It's beyond common sense and 
understanding, however hard I might try to understand in view of 
their status as students." 
  Chief policy coordinator Kang Sam-chae added, "It's shocking 
to hear them crying for the downfall of the civilian government 
despite the times having changed. It appears that they have now 
reached a dangerous level and we should not let them remain at 
this level." 
  Chairman Kim recently produced evidence that an apparent 
pro- 
North Korean organization has distributed leaflets to important 
figures which support Kim Il-song's planned power transfer to 
his son, Chong-il, under the chuche (self-reliance) ideology. 
Hanchongnyon then declared a pro-North Korean line. Faced with 
these developments, the DLP plans to call a meeting with the 
government shortly to call for action against pro-North Korean 
elements in society. 
  Chongwadae [presidential offices], though shocked by 
Hanchongnyon's declaration of a pro-North Korean line, is moving 
to increase the people's sense of national security. 
  The combination of the nuclear issue having entered a 
critical phase, the inscrutability of North Korea's leaders and 
Hanchongnyon's abrupt move toward Pyongyang is causing 
Chongwadae officials great concern about pro-North Korean 
elements in the South. 
  In addition to thoroughly investigating communist 
sympathizers, the government should paint a true picture of 
Hanchongnyon so that the organization cannot take root in 
society, one official said. 
  "Those students, though small in number, denounce the 
legitimate civilian government based on popular support, while 
blindly supporting North Korea's chuche ideology and communism 
though their fictitiousness -- this has already been proven. 
I'm just surprised that such students are still leading the 
student movement. The situation now requires us to increase our 
sense of national security, in addition to judicial action 
against them." 
  He added, "The North Korean nuclear issue is now facing a 
critical moment and there is the possibility that food shortages 
and other economic ills will force North Korea into abrupt 
action. These and Hanchongnyon's pro-North Korean line make us 
worry about national security." 
  He then called on South Koreans to cooperate in the 
government's investigation of Hanchongnyon leaders. 
  The opposition Democratic Party is critical of 
Hanchongnyon's 
pro-North Korean line, while attributing the student 
organization's stance to the confusion in the government's 
unification policy. 
  Supreme Councilor Cho Se-hyong said, "It's true that 
Hanchongnyon's inaugural statement contains some improper words 
and phrases. Nonetheless, I can't understand why the government 
is making a political issue of Hanchongnyon, rather than dealing 
with it according to the law. 
  "The government is heightening the people's unease by 
creating a tense atmosphere over the North Korean nuclear issue, 
and I demand that the government announce what measures it has 
to deal with the nuclear issue." 
  Soldier-turned politician Rep. Yim Pok-chin said, "Students 
had not been such activists until recently and I can't 
understand why and how they have changed into such activists." 
  Deputy spokesman Kim Yong-sok said, "It appears that 
students' radical demands and extreme acts have shocked 
citizens. But the government should be held partially 
responsible for the undesirable acts of students because it has 
monopolized information on North Korea on the pretext of its 
being the sole agent of carrying out unification policy. 
  "The government should guarantee the freedom of unification 
policy debates and present its blueprint for unification to the 
people so that students will wake up from the illusion that they 
alone can achieve unification."

  [Text] Japan's NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reports on 28 May that 
a new plan is being mapped out for the ROK, the United States, 
Japan, and international organizations to provide economic 
assistance to North Korea under the condition that North Korea 
accepts full-scope nuclear inspections [chonmyonjogin 
haeksachal]. 
  NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reported that the plan to assist North 
Korea was tapped out by the United States in a joint 
consultation meeting between the three countries. It also 
reported that it seems that the ROK and Japan already notified 
the United States that such a proposal will be dealt with 
(?positively). 
  NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reported that therefore, there is a 
possibility that the United States will reveal a method for a 
comprehensive assistance at the third round of high-level 
DPRK-U.S. talks which is expected to take place early next 
month, depending on North Korea's attitude in the negotiations. 
  It was learned that the multinational assistance method the 
United States is planning is expected to include China, Russia, 
the World Bank, and the United Nations Development Program to 
organize a consultative body.

  [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam had 
a telephone conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton Monday 
morning and reaffirmed the Seoul-Washington system for close 
consultations on the North Korean nuclear dispute. 
  President Kim also explained the background of his upcoming 
visit to Russia, said Presidential Spokesman Chu Ton-sik. 
  Kim told Clinton that the international community's efforts 
to resolve the nuclear row peacefully face a grave challenge 
from North Korea's refueling operation at its 5-megawatt reactor. 
  Once again, Kim stressed the need for closer consultations 
between South Korea and the United States on the nuclear issue, 
Chu said. 
  The phone call, which lasted for about 20 minutes from 8:35 
AM (KST), was made as Clinton was preparing to leave Washington 
for Europe to attend commemorative events marking the 50th 
anniversary of D-day. 
  The two leaders agreed that the dispute over Pyongyang's 
nuclear program has reached a very dangerous point and that 
their countries need closer consultations and resolute 
cooperation to cope with the situation, Chu said. 
  Clinton told Kim that the five permanent members of the UN 
Security Council are preparing to adopt a council presidential 
statement on the issue. 
  The statement would demand that North Korea immediately stop 
changing nuclear fuel rods at the reactor and guarantee 
inspections by experts from the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA), Clinton explained. 
  Although the statement would make no mention of possible 
sanctions against North Korea, Clinton said it would carry an 
important point urging Pyongyang to fulfill its obligations to 
settle the nuclear row through dialogue, according to Chu. 
  President Kim expressed his total agreement with the 
Security 
Council's initial attempt to resolve the issue through dialogue, 
Chu said. 
  But Kim also stressed to Clinton that there may be no other 
choice but to proceed with sanctions, the spokesman said. 
  Clinton said that if the firm cooperative system between 
Washington and Seoul was maintained and Japan's and China's 
support secured, no problem would arise that could not be 
resolved, according to Chu. 
  President Kim's visit to Russia carries import if he can 
secure Russian support on the issue, Clinton said. 
  Since China initiated the adoption of the Security Council 
president's statement on North Korea last time, it would feel 
obliged to go along with the United States, Japan and South 
Korea, Kim told Clinton. 
  America's recent renewal of China's most-favored-nation 
trading status would also help resolve the nuclear row, Kim 
added. 
  Since both presidents are about to embark on overseas trips, 
they have agreed to remain in touch through the phone anywhere 
and at any time, Chu said. 
  Kim and Clinton shared the opinion that they may have to 
discuss sanctions against North Korea during their trips, Chu 
said. 
  Asked about the significance of further and apparently 
urgent 
consultations by Kim and Clinton during their trips, Chu said 
the United Nations will have to proceed to sanctions if there is 
no sign of resolution following the first warning.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Son Ki-yong] </F>
  [Text] With the North Korean nuclear row heading for a 
showdown in the United Nations Security Council, South Korean 
officials expressed dissatisfaction over the United States' 
fruitless diplomatic gestures to North Korea. 
  "Washington has so far made a series of concessions to 
Pyongyang without getting anything substantial in return," an 
official said. 
  Seoul dropped its demand, the exchange of special envoys, to 
help expedite Washington-Pyongyang talks and virtually gave a 
mandate to Washington to discuss the nuclear row with Pyongyang 
on a bilateral basis, minimizing its intervention for a quick 
solution to the nuclear impasse. 
  But North Korea showed no signs of yielding to international 
pressure aimed at seeking its nuclear transparency and has 
completed half of the refuelling of the five-megawatt reactor, 
whose inspection is decisive to determining whether the North 
has diverted nuclear materials. 
  Meanwhile, the United States first threatened to cancel any 
talks with North Korea if it goes ahead with the refuelling of 
the reactor. But it retreated from the position when Pyongyang 
started the controversial refuelling. 
  "As the United States yields to Pyongyang step by step 
without taking any punitive measures, North Korea is no longer 
taking U.S. threats as serious," the official said. 
  The official added that the time has come to employ a 
"stick" 
as a show of force, which will also give the United States an 
edge in future negotiations with North Korea. 
  His remarks were made in the same context with those by 
Deputy Premier Yi Hong-ku. Yi said in a recent meeting with 
newspaper editors that the declaration of a nuclear-free 
peninsula will be nullified if North Korea is confirmed to 
possess nuclear bombs. 
  The deputy premier later told lawmakers that his remarks 
were 
motivated at pressing the United States and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency to make further efforts to persuade 
Pyongyang to drop its nuclear weapons program. 
  Now that Seoul and Washington are moving to bring the 
nuclear 
issue to the U.N. Security Council, officials said that it is 
required to coordinate positions between them and set up a new 
approach to avoid a catastrophe. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, returning from an early 
morning meeting of security-related ministers, summoned U.S. 
Amb. James Laney to his office and discussed measures to cope 
with the new developments. 
  In the meeting, President Kim instructed Han to consult with 
the four major countries involved, the United States, Japan, 
Russia and China as the Security Council is set to meet today to 
discuss actions against Pyongyang. 
  Han told Amb. Laney about what was discussed in a morning 
meeting of security-related ministers, presided over by 
President Kim Yong- sam at Chongwadae. 
  "Before President Kim's visit to Russia, we held in-depth 
discussions on various issues," Han told Laney at the start of 
the meeting. 
  A ministry spokesman said later that Han and Laney agreed to 
closely coordinate their policies. 
  "Han and Laney shared the view that the North Korean nuclear 
issue is entering the serious stage," the spokesman said. 
  They agreed to seek a negotiated solution to the nuclear 
issue but warned North Korea against eroding the basis for 
negotiations, he added. 
  If North Korea doesn't stop the refuelling right now, the 
foundation for negotiations will be completely shattered, he 
added.

  [Text] Seoul, May 28 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the United 
States agreed to extend their interim trade negotiating channel 
for one year, the Foreign Ministry announced Saturday, ending 
speculation that the channel would be closed due to trade 
friction between the two countries. 
  Assistant Foreign Minister for Economic Affairs Son 
Chun-yong, Seoul's top representative at the South Korea-U.S. 
Dialogue for Economic Cooperation (DEC), talked with Daniel 
Tarullo, assistant secretary of state for economic and 
agricultural affairs, over the phone Friday evening and agreed 
to the extension, the ministry said. 
  Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Bill Clinton launched the DEC at 
a summit in July 1993. Seoul hoped to keep the DEC functioning 
for one more year, but strained trade relations with Washington 
blurred the prospects until Thursday's final decision, ministry 
officials said. 
  The 12th South Korea-U.S. economic consultation opens 
between 
the two nations' vice foreign ministers in Washington on June 
22, with a final report by the DEC to be adopted.

<F P=106> [Article by Song Ui-tal: "Russia's Ultramodern Brains Are </F>
Coming in Flocks"] 
  [Excerpts] The Hanbit Apartments are at a 10-minute-drive 
from the Taedok Research Complex in Yusong District, Taejon 
city. About 20 blue-eyed members of the "Russian team" join in 
this apartment complex' soccer team practice at 0530 every 
morning. The "Russian team" is merely a pet name given by the 
residents of this apartment complex, not a real soccer team 
representing Russia. They are high- level Russian technological 
brains who have been invited to and are working at the Samsung 
Space Aeronautical Research Institute. [passage omitted] 
  After an hour of exercise, they come to the office each 
morning on a 45-seat bus provided by the institute. They are 
researchers from the SDC [expansion unknown], a company 
specializing in engine design located in Moscow, Russia. 
  The SDC is a private company formed in 1989 by former 
researchers of "Soyuz," Russia's state-run engine designing 
bureau, with a total of 1,500 employees. A total of 28 came to 
ROK, including seven doctorate-degree holders. Most of them are 
from the Moscow (?Mollini) University, which is called "Russia's 
MIT," and from the Moscow Aviation College. They came to this 
research complex last June under a one-year contract, and live 
in apartments ranging from 30-pyong [one pyong is equivalent to 
3.954 square yards] to 45- pyong in size, provided by Samsung. 
They participate in debates with researchers from Samsung and in 
joint research projects, and sometimes offer advice. 
  Their specialized fields are mainly design and manufacturing 
of industrial gas turbine engines, as well as technological 
support for production. Samsung Aviation Company has intensively 
researched this field for several years, according to its 
long-term development plan. This being the case, the 28 Russians 
are providing technical training to the Samsung side in a 
person-to-person basis under a tight schedule in their three 
respective specialized fields-- combustion, turbine, and 
compression. Kim Chae-chol (47), director of the company and 
head of a research and development team, said: The United States 
and Japan, which have ultramodern technology in these fields, 
have built thick barriers to protect their technology. Under 
this situation, cooperation from Russia's technological camp, 
which competes with the United States for the summit position of 
the world, is of great help to us. In the event that we obtain a 
broad range of technology, ranging from basic technology to 
high-level applied technology, including aircraft engine, the 
ROK will be able to enter into the rank of 10-top aviation 
industry states before long. 
  According to the materials of the Ministry of Science and 
Technology, since scientific and technological exchanges began 
on a full scale between the two nations in December 1990 when 
the ROK- Russia agreement on science and technology was 
concluded, the number of Russian scientists and technicians, who 
came to the ROK and stayed for over a month, was 95 in 1992 and 
116 in 1993. This number is expected to reach 150 this year, 
thus showing nearly a 25 percent increase each year. [passage 
omitted] 
  The areas in which Russian scientists have remarkably 
advanced are ultramodern technology fields including space 
aeronautics, new materials, machinery, semiconductor, and 
chemistry, where the domestic technological foundation is 
relatively weak. 
  Government-supported research institutes, including the 
Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Atomic Energy 
Research Institute, Energy Research Institute, Machinery 
Research Institute, and Standardization Research Institute; 
civilian enterprises that are in true need of basic and 
ultramodern science and technology; and even universities, 
competitively employ Russian scientists and technicians. Thus, 
they are accelerating the development of new technology. In 
particular, practical joint research results have appeared in 
succession in certain research project domains. Such results are 
being accepted as a "green light" for strengthening the nation's 
competitive power in industrial fields. [passage omitted] 
  In 1992, the ROK and Russia, for the first time, jointly 
applied for patents for automobile oil filters; carbon pellicle 
coating equipment, and natural gas engines. This is regarded as 
an example of the achievements attained with the support of 
Russian scientists. 
  Civilian business firms are inviting Russian scientists more 
actively than government-supported research organizations, thus 
attracting the people's attention. This trend is being led by 
large business groups such as Samsung, Daewoo, and Lucky-Gold 
Star. Samsung was the first business group to employ Russian 
scientists under long-term contracts. In April 1992, Samsung 
employed Mr. (Georgiy Park), a Moscow University doctorate 
degree graduate with a major in semiconductors, under a one-year 
contract basis. He has been in charge of the joint research 
development of optical electronics at the Samsung General 
Research Institute in Kihung, Kyonggi Province. He is known to 
be a third-generation Korean in Russia. He worked as senior 
researcher at the (Ioepe) Research Institute and (Polius) 
Research Institute, renowned as authoritative research 
institutes in Russia. 
  In addition, the Samsung General Chemical Company invited 
four technicians from the (Kalkin) Research Institute, which is 
reputed for its development of new ultramodern materials of 
synthetic chemistry, to work in its chemical research institute 
at the Taedok Research Complex, starting in November 1993. 
[passage omitted] 
  What interests the people is that the Russian technical 
teams' activities have even extended to the domestic "beer war." 
On 20 May, the Chillo Group's "Kas Beer" challenged "Hite Beer" 
and "OB-Ice Beer." [passage omitted] 
  The Russian scientists actively responded to the request for 
participation in long- and short-term joint projects by major 
universities including the Seoul University, Inha University, 
Catholic University, Kyongbuk University, Kyonghui University, 
and Hongik University, and the number of Russian scientists 
participating in domestic projects ranges from 20 to 50 each 
year. The Russian scientists' advance to the ROK has been 
prompted by the increasing demand for them by our domestic 
business groups. A ROK business firm can acquire high-level 
technology, which cannot be obtained from any other advanced 
country, by paying a low salary of between $1,000 and $2,000 a 
month. This being the case, the increase in demand is quite 
natural. On the other hand, the Russian scientists are paid 
three times more in the ROK than in their home country. 
  However, relevant officials from business circles point out 
that since the treaty for the prevention of double taxation 
between the ROK and Russia and other CIS countries has not been 
concluded, Russian scientists are subject to pay over 20 percent 
higher tax- rate. As a result, instances in which Russian 
scientists have refused our side's employment proposals are 
increasing. Besides, precise materials concerning the background 
of Russian research institutes and scientists are not available 
at home, thus causing difficulties in choosing Russian 
scientists. 
  Yi Chin-kyu, secretary at the technical cooperation section 
in the Ministry of Science and Technology, pointed out that 
"Russia has recently emerged rapidly as a source for our nation 
to import ultramodern technology, pushing aside the United 
States, Japan, and the European Union. With a view to 
invigorating the exchange of scientists between the ROK and 
Russia, the government will abolish various restrictions, 
including the ratification of the treaty for prevention of 
double taxation and the simplification of the visa issuance 
procedure, and will work out plans for the active inducement of 
Russian scientists."

  [Text] A ceremony marking the inauguration of the 
second-term Korean Federation of University Student Councils 
[Hanchongnyon] has been held in Choson University in Kwangju for 
three days from 27 May. Contrary to the people's worries, the 
event was held peacefully. 
  On the afternoon today, the last day of the inauguration 
ceremony, about 30,000 Hanchongnyon students staged a rally of 
resolution for clarification of the truth in the 18 May [1980] 
incident at the plaza in Kumnan-no in front of the provincial 
office building in Kwangju. They called for a probe in the 18 
May incident and the punishment of the responsible figures. 
  After the rally, the college students staged a street 
demonstration passing by the office building of the Democratic 
Liberal Party and the U.S. Cultural Center. However, there were 
no clashes between them and police. 
  The students, who attended the ceremony for Hanchongnyon 
inauguration, held final rallies in Chonnam University and 
Choson University after street demonstration. After the rallies, 
they left for homes by buses. 
  The Hanchongnyon's inauguration ceremony, which started on 
27 
May, did not show any act that raises problem, such as excessive 
demonstrations in downtown and attempt to contact North Korean 
students through telephone or faxmile. Thus, the event showed a 
drastically changed shape.

<F P=106> [By Kohei Murayama] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Japanese trade and finance 
officials are hoping bilateral insurance talks scheduled for 
Wednesday [1 June] and Thursday in Tokyo will set the pace for 
the resumed Japan-U.S. "framework" trade negotiations and an 
overall easing of the U.S. stance on targets. 
  Already comments from both sides have paved the way for 
agreement -- at least as far as the insurance sector is 
concerned. 
  One senior Japanese Finance Ministry official has said the 
United States has acknowledged that setting yardsticks to 
measure Japan's market access is not appropriate. 
  And a U.S. diplomatic official in Tokyo has named the 
insurance business in saying problems exist in adopting 
objective criteria to measure market shares in areas full of 
regulations, which he distiguished from the free-hand automobile 
sector. 
  In fact, negotiators from both sides had suggested insurance 
talks were approaching consensus before the overall talks hit a 
snag due to sharp differences on two of the three priority areas 
-- automobile and auto parts, and government procurement of 
telecommunications and medical equipment. 
  If their comments hold true and negotiations are wrapped up, 
the future of the still unclear agreement reached by the two 
nations last week for reopening bilateral trade talks may become 
more certain. 
  The breakthrough during exploratory talks came after a 
four-day marathon in Washington, with the two sides agreeing to 
set both quantitative and qualitative benchmarks instead of 
numerical targets for each of the negotiation sectors. 
  The framework talks started in July last year under an 
accord 
by then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton in Tokyo with the goal of setting a new framework for 
the two nations' trade relations. 
  But they were ruptured in February when then Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa and Clinton failed to reach a common ground 
over their definition of "objective criteria" during a summit in 
Washington. 
  The insurance talks will reopen the stalled framework 
negotiations Wednesday in Tokyo. Talks on other priority areas 
will follow. 
  Automobiles and auto parts are scheduled for Thursday and 
Friday in Washington, and government procurement of 
telecommunications equipment in Tokyo on Friday and Saturday, 
and medical equipment in Tokyo next Tuesday and Wednesday. 
  Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii has indicated that 
Japan will not offer any new commitments on the insurance 
negotiations, which are in the hands of his ministry. 
  "We will put our upmost efforts into realizing the voluntary 
measures" that are included in the March market-opening package, 
he said in a recent news meeting. 
  Indeed, the measures encompass the majority of U.S demands, 
including deregulation, simpler licensing and adoption of a 
brokering system. 
  The remaining key issues are the unclear "keiretsu," mutual 
stockholding relationships between insurers and sales agents, 
and a third area such as policies for cancer and nursing care. 
  The last area appears to hold the clue for the direction of 
the insurance talks, with the U.S. calling on Japan to keep its 
restriction on Japanese insurers. As a form of special 
treatment, Japan only allows foreign insurers to engage in the 
area. 
  Japan is expected to lift the ban in about two years, with 
the insurance council, an advisory panel to the finance 
minister, now preparing a report on legal revisions. The 
package to reform insurance-related laws for the first time in 
50 years is scheduled for submission to the Diet next year. 
  The U.S. is asking Japan to wait for five years at least. A 
U.S. Government source said earlier this week that planned 
revision in the third area would hamper new entries by foreign 
insurers. 
  Meanwhile, Japanese officials are bewildered over the U.S. 
demand, which they say contradicts deregulatory steps. 
  On the "keiretsu" practice, Japan is expected to seek 
support 
for its compromise of adopting a brokering system. 
  A ministry negotiator said the government cannot intervene 
in 
the "keiretsu" system, which is a private-sector dealing, and 
noted that such unfair practices toward foreign insurers also 
prevail in the U.S. 
  He cited the brokering system that is restricted in many 
states and the liability reserves some U.S. states oblige 
foreign insurers to build up. 
  Indeed, the negotiator said one major dispute has been over 
Japan's demand for "two-way negotiations" to discuss such unfair 
practices in the U.S. 
  Japanese industry leaders said they just do not understand 
why the insurance business was included in the framework talks. 
  Toshiomi Uragami, chairman of the Life Insurance 
Association, 
said Japan in fact has a trade deficit with the U.S. in the 
insurance field. 
  "I haven't heard of any complaints from U.S. insurers 
already 
present in Japan, and many of them have been successful here," 
he said. 
  In conceding there is a lack of communication, Takashi 
Onoda, 
chairman of the Marine and Fire Insurance Association, said his 
industry plans to set up a forum to exchange views with U.S. 
industry leaders. 
  A ministry source said, "all we needed was a bit of U.S. 
compromise" on numerical targets by splitting the insurance area 
from other fields.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- International Trade and 
Industry Minister Eijiro Hata on Tuesday [31 May] reiterated 
Japan's opposition to setting "numerical targets" to gauge 
foreign access to its markets. 
  "Japan could not swallow any U.S. proposals that would lead 
to acceptance of numerical trade targets," Hata told a press 
conference. 
  Hata was speaking ahead of the resumption Wednesday of 
sectoral talks on a new bilateral trade framework. 
  Japan and the United States have agreed to restart the 
deadlocked trade talks on condition that Washington will not 
bring up the issue of numerical targets, Hata said. 
  But "a source of contention" still exists between the two 
countries, he added. 
  Recently, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said the 
U.S. will pursue "result-oriented" accords in trade talks with 
Japan, including seeking a guarantee from the Japanese 
Government to expand the number of Japanese auto dealers 
handling U.S.-made models. 
  Whether or not dealers will sell U.S. automobiles is a 
matter 
for the private sector, Hata said. He urged U.S. automakers to 
work harder to make their products attractive to Japanese 
consumers.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- A Japanese Government 
advisory panel on Tuesday [31 May] blasted the "unilateral" or 
"result- oriented" trade approach of the United States as only 
adding "an extra layer of confusion and difficulty" to global 
economic issues. 
  A subcommittee of the Industrial Structure Council, an 
advisory organ to the trade minister, made the criticism in the 
1994 report that identified and analyzed unfair trade policies 
and measures of Japan's 10 major trading partners. 
  The report, the third of its kind, was compiled at a time 
when Japan-U.S. economic relations have yet to be fully mended 
under the long-running bickering over the definition of 
"objective criteria," a set of tools designed to gauge the 
openness of Japan's markets under the so-called framework trade 
talks. 
  The council said analytical standards used in this year's 
report are in line with internationally accepted World Trade 
Organization (WTO) rules, which will expand the scope of 
coverage to include services and intellectual property rights 
from only trade in goods as under the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  The report said Japan's trade rules are basically in 
conformity with the WTO agreement while those of the U.S. 
deviate from it in that the country pursues "result-based 
criteria." 
  "To a large extent, a preoccupation with trade results comes 
from a tendency to see a direct link between current account or 
trade imbalances and inadequate market access," the report said. 
  The report branded the result-oriented U.S. trade approach 
as 
managed trade, explaining that the country resorts to "numerical 
targets" in order to achieve satisfactory results in market 
shares or import values for specific American goods. 
  "We have grave apprehensions about the detrimental impact 
that such policies would have on the free trade system," the 
report said. 
  In a country-by-country survey, the report found problems 
with U.S. trade policy in 10 of the 12 trade sectors covered. 
  "It would appear at first glance that the U.S. has made 
little effort to improve its unfair trade policies and 
measures," the report said. 
  The report showed concern about the recent revival of a 
retaliatory trade clause known as Super 301. "Thinking behind 
unilateral measures like Super 301 is the idea of the same 
country serving both as prosecutor and judge," the report said. 
  U.S. antidumping measures against imports from Japan were 
described by the report as creating "serious problems." 
  Of the 43 antidumping duties imposed by the U.S. on Japanese 
products since 1980, 36 duty orders were still in force as of 
March this year because of the lack of a "sunset" clause, the 
report noted. 
  Regarding areas where unfair practices were dropped in 
Japan's trade with the U.S., the report cited elimination of 
requests for voluntary export restraints on machine tools and 
automobiles. 
  In trade with the European Union (EU), the report pointed 
out 
problems in four of the 12 areas, including abuse of antidumping 
measures, arbitrary approach in enforcing rules of origin and 
unfair tariff classification of mecadecks -- a vital component 
of videocassette recorders. 
  On the other hand, the report appreciated the EU's abolition 
of discriminatory quantitative restrictions on Japanese exports 
in March of this year. 
  The report found five problem areas in Japan's trade with 
South Korea. Among them are rules of origin policy, standard 
and certificate systems and an import source diversification 
system intended to restrict imports from Japan. 
  Other countries and an area covered by this report are 
Australia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Canada and 
Hong Kong. 
  This year's report reviewed for the first time the 
countries' 
agricultural policies and measures, an area newly agreed on 
under the recently concluded GATT Uruguay Round of multilateral 
trade talks. 
  During the negotiating process of the Uruguay Round, trade 
positions were very large from countries to countries on farm 
issues like rice. 
  The report stressed the need for countries to actively use a 
new dispute settlement mechanism under the WTO, a multilateral 
trade body that is expected to replace GATT next January. 
  WTO rules will have more enforcing power with a judicial 
mechanism that will no longer allow countries to block the WTO 
panel's findings against them under the so-called "negative 
consensus" system. 
  "Making use of the strengthened dispute settlement 
procedures 
is a basic obligation of those who support the multilateral 
trading system. Japan should be an active user of these 
procedures when necessary," the report said. 
  The report assessed several issues involved in accession to 
GATT by China and Taiwan. 
  Japan basically supports early GATT membership by China and 
Taiwan, both among Japan's 10 largest trading partners. 
  The report noted, "however, we recognize it is important 
that 
both must first bring into conformity their trade policies and 
measures with the WTO agreement." 
  High tariffs and quantitative import restrictions are among 
problems to be overcome before their entry to GATT, the report 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- Japan will hold 
working-level talks with the United States in Washington next 
Thursday to find ways to increase U.S-made auto and auto parts 
exports to this country, a Japanese trade ministry official said 
Friday [27 May]. 
  The meeting is in line with Tuesday's accord between Tokyo 
and Washington to restart the stalled trade "framework" talks, 
said an official at the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry (MITI) who declined to be named. 
  The official said the planned talks on auto trade, one of 
the 
three priority fields under the framework negotiations, will 
focus on setting "objective criteria" designed to gauge the 
openness of Japan's market. 
  The meeting will then be followed by subcabinet-level 
consultations expected to be held in Tokyo in the week starting 
June 5, the MITI official said. 
  Tokyo will not accept any objective criteria on auto trade 
that are tantamount to "numerical targets," the official said, 
apparently reflecting growing concern in Japan over a possible 
revival of the issue of numerical targets. 
  Under Tuesday's bilateral accord, the U.S. showed its 
explicit commitment not to seek any numerical targets in coming 
sectoral trade talks with Japan. But U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor soon said Washington will pursue "result-oriented" 
accords in sectoral talks, generating concern over the question 
of numerical targets among Japanese Government officials, 
including MITI Chief Eijiro Hata. 
  In Tuesday's talks, Tokyo and Washington refrained from 
defining numerical targets in order to get the deadlocked trade 
talks moving forward. 
  The MITI official said what the Japanese side considers 
numerical targets are quantitative pledges by the government 
regarding future trade performance and trade areas beyond 
government control. 
  Talks to establish a new trade framework have been put on 
hold since February's rupture over the definition of objective 
criteria. 
  The MITI official confirmed that Tokyo has accepted the 
latest U.S. request for including five additional trade areas in 
the priority fields of government procurement, insurance and 
trade in auto and auto parts. 
  Talks on the new areas -- financial services, sheet glass, 
forestry products, intellectual property rights and competition 
policy -- may begin next week, the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- A senior Japanese Trade 
Ministry official Tuesday [31 May] denied a newspaper report 
that Japan will scrap tariffs on sheet glass imports. 
  The report is "totally groundless," the official at the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
  The NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN newspaper said in its Tuesday 
evening edition that MITI will propose to the United States its 
removal of the tariffs, currently set in a range of 0 to 6.3 
percent, sometime in June. 
  The step is intended to boost Japanese imports of sheet 
glass, which accounted for only 7.7 percent of the total 
consumption in Japan in 1993, the daily said. 
  "MITI has not heard anything about the reported plan," the 
official said. 
  Sheet glass is expected to be included in the expanded 
priority trade sectors under the Japan-U.S. "framework" talks 
scheduled to resume Wednesday.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- Japan renewed its pledge 
Friday [27 May] to provide foreign rice exporters with "minimum 
access" to its rice market but left open the possibility of 
importing less rice than required in case of poor harvests 
abroad. 
  "The government should import the agreed-upon quantity of 
rice under normal circumstances, as the government is in a 
position to import it as a state-controlled import item," Farm 
Minister Mutsuki Kato told the House of Representatives Budget 
Committee. 
  Kato was referring to Japan's agreement last December with 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) members obligating 
it to raise the foreign rice share in the Japanese market to at 
least 8 percent by the year 2000. 
  The coalition government has been under opposition pressure 
to clarify its stance following conflicting statements from 
government ministers on the interpretations of the GATT accord. 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata once described the minimum 
access 
accord as "something that resembles an obligation," while 
International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata depicted 
it as an "obligation" when he was serving as agriculture 
minister. 
  Under the GATT accord, Japan is obligated to import 400,000 
tons of foreign rice in fiscal 1995, gradually expanding it to 
800,000 tons by fiscal 2000. 
  However, the government believes Japan would not be obliged 
to meet the requirements when foreign nations do not have 
surplus stockpiles to export to Japan due to their poor 
harvests, according to a government statement.

  [Text] Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, May 27 KYODO -- The 
International Whaling Commission (IWC) Friday [27 May] wrapped 
up a five-day conference after making a landmark decision to 
create a whale sanctuary and rejecting Japan's request for 
permission to catch 50 minke whales. 
  The IWC turned down Japan's request to allow it to catch 50 
minke whales a year along the shores of Japan to support coastal 
communities affected by an IWC-moratorium on commercial whaling. 
  The request was voted down overwhelmingly, with 14 countries 
voting against it. Nine other nations voted for it and seven 
countries abstained. 
  The IWC's cold shoulder, which came on the heels of the 
Thursday decision to establish an antarctic sanctuary, dashed 
Japan's last hope for commercial whaling. 
  The IWC parlance again underscored Japan's increasingly 
isolated position in the international community over the 
whaling issue. 
  It put Japan in a tight corner, posing for it a crucial 
decision on whether it should give up what it calls a 
longstanding cultural heritage of whale eating or bolt out of 
the international organization, observers said. 
  Japanese officials were infuriated over the outcome of the 
session and cried foul play. 
  Kazuo Shima of the Fisheries Agency, Japan's chief delegate, 
blasted the IWC's rejection of Japan's request for a special 
quota on minke whales. 
  Shima argued it is discrimination against Japan since the 
IWC 
decided to increase the number of bowhead whales that Alaskan 
natives may kill under a clause that permits whaling by 
aboriginal groups. 
  "It is a discriminatory handling and is a great 
disappointment for us," he told a news conference. 
  "Bowhead whales are a kind that live only in a small 
number," 
Shima said. "Alaskan aborigines' whaling is partly commercial 
and is no different from Japanese whaling along the shores. It 
is unfair." 
  Shima also criticized the IWC's decision to create a 
sanctuary and its voted call on Japan to reconsider its whaling 
for research. 
  "Japan's argument that further discussions at the IWC 
Science 
Committee are necessary (to make such a decision) was ignored," 
he said. "We cannot allow an emergence of black holes in the 
research on whales. We will continue our research program." 
  Japanese whalers are allowed to catch up to 330 minke whales 
annually under a 12-year research program approved by the IWC. 
  But Japan has been accused by countries opposed to whaling 
and by environmentalists of hunting whales for commercial 
purposes under the guise of a scientific study. 
  The Japanese Government remains on the surface undaunted by 
the international call for reconsidering its research whaling. 
  "We will continue the current whaling research in the 
Antarctic Ocean and will soon start a similar research in the 
North Pacific region," one official said. 
  But some have admitted the planned establishment of a 
sanctuary will make it virtually impossible for Japan to 
continue the study in the current manner. 
  Although Japanese delegations were slightly encouraged by 
the 
IWC's endorsement of the need for scientific research, they did 
not rule out the possibility of Japan's walking out of the 
organization. 
  "We will decide on the issue after consultations with the 
government and people concerned," Shima said at the news 
conference.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Japan will send a government 
team to Canada on Saturday to explore the possibility of 
Japanese participation in U.N. peacekeeping efforts on the Golan 
Heights, officials said Tuesday [31 May]. 
  The move came in response to an unofficial request from the 
United Nations to send personnel and assist Canadian 
peacekeepers in charge of logistics in the Middle East, the 
officials said. 
  The delegation, consisting of five officials from the 
Defense 
Agency and one from the Foreign Ministry, will return home on 
June 10 or 11 after meeting with Canadian Government officials, 
they said. 
  The government will study the possibility of Japan sending 
peacekeepers to the Golan Heights upon receiving a report from 
the team, the officials said. 
  The Golan Heights has been occupied by Israel since it 
seized 
the territory from Syria in 1967. 
  A total of 1,036 troops of the U.N. Disengagement Observer 
Force monitor the cease-fire between Israel and Syria in an area 
determined by a May 1974 accord on disengagement. 
  The U.N. force comprises 464 peacekeepers from Austria, 215 
from Canada and 357 from Poland.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata on Monday [30 May] called for economic assistance 
to isolationist North Korea to stabilize the country and to help 
defuse the tension over Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons 
program. 
  "We can make plenty of efforts to improve the standard of 
living in North Korea. I would like to ask you to open your 
hearts," Hata told an interpellation session in the House of 
Representatives Budget Committee. 
  He stressed, however, that Japan should tie up with the 
United States, South Korea and China to discuss a response to 
the breakdown of negotiations between the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) and North Korea. 
  IAEA inspectors left Pyongyang on Saturday after being 
denied 
an opportunity to take samples from spent fuel rods, discharged 
from North Korea's 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, to verify 
whether nuclear material has been diverted in the past. 
  The United Nations Security Council, which has the power to 
impose sanctions to enforce the IAEA request, is slated to 
discuss this latest development in the longstanding nuclear 
controversy Tuesday. 
  Speaking at the same lower house budget panel, Foreign 
Minister Koji Kakizawa said that the UN nuclear watchdog, 
nonetheless, continues unofficial talks with Pyongyang over the 
monitoring of the fuel rod exchange and full inspections of the 
country's nuclear facilities. 
  "The IAEA after its pullout is continuing (negotiations), 
though it is not possible to say publicly where and with whom," 
Kakizawa said. 
  The U.S., South Korea and other Western nations allege that 
North Korea is attempting to build atomic weapons. 
  North Korea claims its nuclear program pursues strictly 
civilian purposes, but has repeatedly refused to comply with 
nuclear safeguard accords it signed with the agency.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Japan may halt all 
remittances to North Korea and take other measures if the United 
Nations decides to slap sanctions against Pyongyang in protest 
over its continued resistance to the inspection of spent fuel 
rods, government sources said Monday [30 May]. 
  If the U.N. Security Council (UNSC) adopts economic 
embargoes 
against North Korea, the Japanese Government is expected to 
follow with curbs on trade and transport between the two 
countries. 
  The possibility of sanctions has grown since the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Saturday its 
negotiations with North Korea over the fuel rod issue failed. 
  The U.N. nuclear watchdog has been asking to be allowed to 
examine the spent fuel rods to determine if plutonium had been 
siphoned off to make nuclear bombs. 
  The failure of the nuclear negotiations has put Japan in a 
quandary, leaving the country sandwiched between international 
calls for action against its neighbor and the fear of angering 
China. 
  The sources said the government will make a final decision 
after taking into account the moves not only by the UNSC but 
also by China, which maintains close ties with Pyongyang. 
  For the possible sanctions, the Ministry of Finance is 
considering suspending all remittances to the country, which 
amount to 60 billion yen a year. 
  Private banks have already voluntarily refrained from 
sending 
dollars to North Korea. 
  On the trade front, the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry (MITI) is thinking of the possibility of a virtual halt 
in North Korea-bound exports by requiring all shipments to be 
approved by the MITI chief. 
  Two-way trade amounted to 50 billion yen worth last year. 
  Furthermore, the Transport Ministry, for its part, can 
reduce 
the number of charter flights between the two countries -- there 
are about 80 a year at present -- and curb tourism. 
  Japan imposes similar sanctions against Libya and Iraq. 
  The sources said such steps would likely put a serious 
strain 
on the bilateral ties and may damage Japan's business with China.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Halting dollar transfers to 
North Korea may hurt Japanese banks' business operations, the 
industry leader cautioned Tuesday [31 May]. 
  With the loss of dollar-denominated remittances, "one cannot 
say it is no hindrance to operations," said Toshio Morikawa, 
chairman of the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan. 
  Morikawa was addressing a regular news conference a day 
after 
government sources said Japan may halt all remittances to North 
Korea if the United Nations imposes sanctions on Pyongyang for 
its refusal to permit inspections of its spent nuclear fuel rods. 
  Private banks have already stopped sending dollars to the 
country after Utsunomiya-based Ashikaga Bank, which handles most 
North Korean remittances, decided not to serve as an 
intermediary for other Japanese banks, informed sources told 
KYODO NEWS SERVICE earlier this month. 
  On measures to deal with the mountain of bad debts that 
Japanese banks hold, Morikawa said he was "quite cautious" about 
suggestions that banks accept one-time losses, a postwar taboo, 
in order to write off the loans more quickly. 
  Saying he could only speak for Sumitomo Bank, of which he is 
president, Morikawa said it is necessary to consider how society 
would accept such a move and how it would affect operations. 
  Bank of Japan and Finance Ministry leaders have said they 
support active loan writeoffs but they have avoided the direct 
question of going into the red to clear the problem loans, a 
legacy of the late 1980s lending spree. 
  Japan's 21 leading banks said late last week they slashed 
their profits for the business year through March to write off 
3.61 trillion yen in bad loans, up 2.6 times from fiscal 1992. 
  The bad loan total at the 11 leading commercial banks, three 
long-term credit banks and seven trust banks was 13.58 trillion 
yen as of March 31, up 801.6 billion yen from a year before but 
down 184 billion yen from six months earlier. 
  On the postponed signing of a planned merger of three 
second-tier regional banks in northeast Japan, Morikawa said 
banks must "get sufficient understanding from their employees 
and clients" but that mergers remain "an important option" for 
restructuring. 
  Officials at Sendai-based Tokuyo City Bank, Kita-Nippon Bank 
of Morioka and Shokusan Bank of Yamagata said the indefinite 
delay of the signing, originally scheduled for Tuesday, resulted 
from a procedural delay. 
  But banking sources said the merger ran into stiff 
opposition 
from employees' unions and customers of Kita-Nippon Bank. 
  Morikawa also expressed support for continued corporate 
political contributions. 
  "I do not think corporate contributions are completely bad," 
he said. "As things are now, making appropriate contributions 
to groups aiming to promote a free economy cannot be helped."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Japan on Monday [30 May] 
expressed regret over North Korea's refusal to suspend the 
refueling of a nuclear reactor suspected of being used to 
produce nuclear weapons. 
  "It is very regrettable North Korea has failed to make 
sincere response to the IAEA's efforts," Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Hiroshi Kumagai said at a news conference. 
  North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) 
broke off their three-day talks in Pyongyang on Friday after the 
two sides failed to come to agreement over the inspection of 
spent fuel rods removed at the reactor. 
  The top government spokesman also demanded that North Korea 
immediately suspend the removal of nuclear fuel rods from its 5- 
megawatt nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, 90 kilometers north of the 
capital, and fully abide by international nuclear safeguards. 
  The IAEA has told north Korean negotiators that continuing 
replacement of fuel rods without inspection violates safeguards 
requirements as specified by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty. 
  Saying Japan has tried to persuade North Korea to suspend 
the 
refueling in concert with the United States, South Korea and 
China, Kumagai vowed further efforts to grapple with the 
communist country's suspected nuclear arms program. 
  Meanwhile, Kumagai withheld comments when asked if 
Pyongyang's reported preparations for test-launching a missile 
is linked with the outcome of the North Korea-IAEA talks. 
  North Korea test-launched the Nodong-1 missile, with an 
estimated 1,000-kilometer range, over the sea of Japan in May 
1993. 
  Pyongyang's development of a long-range missile poses a 
serious threat to Japan and South Korea, as does its suspected 
nuclear arms program.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Japan on Tuesday [31 May] 
offered support for a presidential statement by the U.N. 
Security Council [UNSC] "strongly" urging North Korea to suspend 
the unmonitored exchange of spent fuel rods at a 5-megawatt 
reactor in Yongbyon. 
  "The Japanese Government supports the contents of this 
statement by the president of the Security Council," said a 
Foreign Ministry statement read by deputy spokesman Kishichiro 
Amae. 
  Japan also expresses concern "about the course of events and 
strongly urges North Korea to immediately stop this operation 
and make consultations with the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA)," Amae said. 
  The Security Council on Monday unanimously adopted at an 
unofficial emergency session the presidential statement warning 
"further Security Council consideration" should North Korea 
continue to bar the IAEA from examining the discharged rods. 
  The 15-member council, acting at the request of the United 
States after receiving a letter by U.N. Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus- Ghali from IAEA chief Hans Blix, said it is "gravely 
concerned" about the IAEA's assessment. It did not, however, 
directly refer to sanctions. 
  Amae said Japan is making "various types of diplomatic 
efforts," such as urging related countries, including the U.S., 
South Korea and China, to exert their influence in dissuading 
North Korea from going nuclear. 
  But he declined to elaborate.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- The Japanese National 
Security Council [NSC] headed by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on 
Tuesday [31 May] took up the issue of Pyongyang's refusal to 
permit full inspections of its nuclear activities, governemnt 
sources said. 
  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa reportedly briefed the 
meeting 
on the collapse of talks between North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) over the inspection of 
spent fuel rods being removed from a 5-megawatt reactor in the 
Yongbyon complex. 
  Kakizawa also briefed the closed-door meeting on the 
discussion currently under way within the United Nations 
Security Council and reaction from other nations to the nuclear 
impasse, the sources said. 
  Kakizawa later told reporters that North Korea has already 
removed about half of the 8,000 fuel rods in the experimental 
reactor. 
  He said that if the United Nations had waited to adopt a 
presidential statement on the reactor refueling, the opportunity 
to ensure no radioactive materials from the reactor have been 
diverted to military purposes would be lost. 
  At Tuesday's meeting in Tokyo, the Japanese Defense Agency 
explained the situation on the Korean peninsula and reported on 
information it had received from the United States about North 
Korea's expected missile launch, government sources said. 
  In New York on Monday, the UN Security Council adopted a 
presidential statement urging North Korea to halt the fuel rod 
removal after receiving a letter from the IAEA on Friday.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- British Trade Minister 
Richard Needham called for Japanese support Tuesday [31 May] in 
a campaign to boost the entry of British companies into the 
Japanese market, Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  In a meeting with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, Needham 
called for Japan to support the "action Japan" campaign, the 
third such campaign by Britain to boost trade with Japan, the 
officials said. 
  The "action Japan" campaign aims at offering advice and 
specific information on 10 industrial sectors in the Japanese 
market to British companies, they said. 
  Needham also vowed to try to deepen British firms' 
understanding of the Japanese market and to "constructively" 
solve the trade imbalance with Japan, they said. 
  Kakizawa told Needham that Japan intends to support the 
British efforts as much as possible and pointed to the need for 
cooperation by both Japanese and British companies in the world 
to strengthen bilateral economic ties, the officials said. 
  Needham arrived in Japan on Monday to promote the trade 
campaign. He is scheduled to leave Japan for Taiwan on Tuesday.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Britain announced an action 
program Tuesday [31 May] to provide British companies with 
better export opportunities in Japan. 
  The "action Japan" program is aimed at creating a 
partnership 
between Japan and Britain both at the governmental and private- 
sector levels to make British products more competitive not only 
in Japan but in global markets, British Trade and Industry 
Minister Richard Needham said at a news conference in Tokyo. 
  The British Government has selected 10 industrial sectors 
with the most growth potential as focusing areas under the 
export campaign, Needham said. 
  He said the program will center on trade missions, trade 
fairs, seminars and marketing research, all to be conducted 
jointly with the Japan External Trade Organization. 
  The 10 designated sectors are health care, auto parts, 
marine 
equipment, power generation equipment, construction, giant 
global projects, electronic components, environmental equipment 
and services, food and beverages, and lifestyle-related areas 
such as clothing, textiles and retailing. 
  Britain wants to expand Japanese-bound exports to 3.5 
billion 
pounds a year from the current 2.6 billion pounds within two or 
three years, Needham said. 
  As a way to create larger business opportunities for British 
firms, needham stressed the need for the Japanese Government to 
ease its control on rules and regulations. 
  Needham said he recently presented to the Japanese 
Government 
a list of industrial sectors where Britain wants to see 
deregulation. 
  The sectors are financial services, legal services, 
telecommunications, oil, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, liquors, 
food and beverages, autos and marine equipment, the trade 
minister said. 
  It is necessary for British firms to compete with Japanese 
counterparts "on a level playing field," Needham said. 
  Needham is visiting Japan as part of an export-promoting 
tour 
of five Pacific rim countries. 
  "Action Japan" is the third program of its kind that Britain 
has formulated, following "opportunity Japan" in 1988 and 
"priority Japan" in 1991.

year, government officials said. 
  The decision follows the overall extension of the UN

officials said. 
  The Japanese will stay until Feb. 15, 1995 in the second 
extension of their dispatch. The first extension was granted in 
November last year. 
  The group, who currently serve in the headquarters of the UN 
mission in the African nation, left Japan on May 18 to replace 
another group of five SDF members who returned on Sunday after 
serving a year there. 
  In addition to the five, 48 SDF members are serving in two 
provices in Mozambique.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- The House of Representatives 
Budget Committee will likely vote June 8 to approve the 
long-overdue 73 trillion yen fiscal 1994 budget bill the passage 
of which has been stalled over an opposition demand to 
scrutinize money scandals involving general contractors and 
politicians, Diet sources said. 
  The prospects of the crucial bill clearing the parliamentary 
hurdle have been strengthened following an agreement between the 
ruling coalition and the opposition to hold intensive debate on 
the political ethics issue at the panel on June 6, the sources 
said. 
  The accord to give the go-ahead to the bill's passage was 
struck at a meeting of the panel's directors from both the 
coalition and the opposition, they said. 
  If the bill clears the key hurdle, it will be immediately 
referred to the House of Councillors for its approval. 
  The director of the No.1 opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
hinted that the party may demand parliamentary summoning of 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa 
as a sworn witness to the debate over allegations that he 
received illicit funding from general contractors, the sources 
said. 
  The director of the Social Democratic Party voiced the 
party's readiness to go along with the LDP demand. 
  The SDP, which stormed out of the coalition on April 26 over 
the abrupt formation of a large non-SDP conservative 
parliamentary bloc in the lower chamber, has taken a 
confrontational parliamentary stance against the coalition in 
recent weeks.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Police Monday [30 May] 
arrested a member of a right-wing organization after he fired a 
gun shot at the ceiling of a hotel lobby in an abortive attempt 
to attack former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Hosokawa, who escaped unhurt, was on his way home from a 
party marking the establishment of the Tokyo chapter of the 
Japan New Party [JNP] which he heads, held at the Keio Plaza 
Hotel. 
  Police identified the suspect as Masakatsu Nozoe, 52. His 
shot missed the target as plainclothes men slapped the gunman on 
his hands holding a revolver aimed at Hosokawa, witnesses said. 
  But police later quoted Nozoe as saying he first aimed at 
Hosokawa but then fired at the ceiling. 
  The alleged assailant later told police that he had become 
upset with Hosokawa's apologies for Japan's wartime 
responsibilities and over his economic policies. 
  According to police, Nozoe approached the former prime 
minister in the third floor lobby of the hotel and fired the gun 
in the direction of Hosokawa. 
  Police officers immediately subdued the assailant, while 
plainclothes officers rushed the former premier out of the hotel 
and into a waiting car. 
  A shaken Hosokawa reportedly expressed concern for his wife 
as he was escorted out of the hotel, saying, "Kayoko is still 
here. Please (take care of her)." 
  Hosokawa, who has been burdened with questions surrounding 
his financial dealings, resigned last month as head of a fragile 
coalition government which replaced four decades of rule by the 
Liberal Democratic Party. 
  He has since maintained a low profile, reportedly staying at 
his Karuizawa retreat and at Tokyo hotels. 
  According to party sources, Hosokawa has been threatened by 
rightist organizations since assuming office last August over 
his apologies for Japanese atrocities during World War II. The 
JNP has reportedly taken precautions to protect Hosokawa since 
then.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- A gunman threatened former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Monday with a shot at the 
ceiling of a Tokyo hotel in what he called a show of protest 
against Hosokawa's past remarks on World War II and economic 
policies, police said. 
  The assailant, identified as Masakatsu Nozoe, 52, a member 
of 
a right-wing organization, was overpowered and detained by 
plainclothes men immediately after the incident in the 
third-floor lobby at the Keio Plaza Hotel, witnesses said. 
  Hosokawa, 56, was unhurt. He was rushed out of the hotel and 
into a waiting car. 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata denounced the attack, saying, 
"such an act would destroy democracy." The last known rightist 
attack on a politician came in March 1992 when a shot was fired 
at Shin Kanemaru, the disgraced kingmaker of the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP). 
  Hosokawa was on his way home from a party at the hotel 
marking the establishment of the Tokyo chapter of the Japan New 
Party (JNP) which he heads. The assailant later told police 
that he had become upset with Hosokawa's apologies for Japan's 
wartime responsibilities and over his economic policies, police 
said. 
  A shaken Hosokawa reportedly expressed concern for his wife 
as he was escorted out of the hotel, saying, "Kayoko is still 
here. Please (take care of her)." Hosokawa, who has been 
burdened with questions surrounding his financial dealings, 
resigned last month as head of a fragile coalition government 
which replaced four decades of rule by the LDP. He has since 
maintained a low profile, reportedly staying at his Karuizawa 
retreat and at Tokyo hotels. 
  According to party sources, Hosokawa has been threatened by 
rightist organizations since assuming office last August over 
his apologies for Japanese atrocities during World War II. The 
JNP has reportedly taken precautions to protect Hosokawa since 
then.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Police Tuesday [31 May] 
started raiding a right-wing organization's office and some 
other locations in connection with Monday's gunshot fired near 
former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, police said. 
  Police are searching the Shinjuku office of the right-wing 
group "Shokonjuku" on suspicion of violating the law to control 
the possession of firearms and swords. 
  Hosokawa escaped unhurt when Masakatsu Nozoe, a one-time 
Shokonjuku member, fired a gun toward the ceiling close to the 
former premier at the Keio Plaza Hotel in Tokyo's Shinjuku ward. 
  Nozoe, 52, was arrested immediately after the attack.

  [Text] Chiba, May 27 KYODO -- Former foreign minister 
Michio Watanabe on Friday [27 May] demanded the resignation en 
masse of the administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata prior 
to the summit in July of seven major industrial democracies in 
Naples, Italy. 
  "We should not allow prime minister Hata to go and sign 
agreements (at the summit)," the veteran politician of the no. 1 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party said. 
  Watanabe appealed to non-LDP politicians with political 
ideals similar to those of the LDP to form a "grand alliance" 
with the LDP in order to oust the current ruling coalition from 
power. 
  "Some forces in the Social Democratic Party, the Democratic 
Socialist Party and Komeito have similar political ideas to 
those of the conservative forces," he said. 
  The remark was a clear departure from his previous 
statements, with which he warned the political community against 
forming a coalition with SDP politicians. 
  Watanabe has repeatedly warned that the presence of SDP 
forces in the ruling coalition would undercut Japan's national 
interests by barring Japan from reforming its tax system or 
taking a tough line in the face of the suspected North Korean 
nuclear arms program.

  [Text] Matsumoto, Nagano Pref., May 28 KYODO -- The chief 
of the largest opposition party said Saturday [28 May] it is 
inevitable that his party will submit a no-confidence motion 
against the minority cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
after passage of the fiscal 1994 state budget through the Diet. 
  Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), 
told reporters that he regards the Social Democratic Party's [of 
Japan] [SDPJ] call for resignation of the Hata cabinet en masse 
as a sign of no-confidence in the cabinet. 
  Kono expressed readiness to strengthen the alliance with the 
SDPJ, the second largest opposition party, saying it is 
important for the two parties, which have great influence in the 
Diet, to have talks. 
  SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo on Thursday called on 
Hata 
to resign voluntarily once the state budget clears the Diet and 
before a no-confidence vote is taken so as to fashion a new 
coalition government. 
  Kubo, the No. 2 man in the SDPJ, has indicated that the SDPJ 
may move to bury the hatchet with its former coalition partners 
and join a new ruling union. 
  The SDPJ walked out of the coalition in late April to 
protest 
the abrupt formation by other coalition parties of a new 
parliamentary group excluding the SDPJ, forcing Hata to form the 
first minority government in 39 years.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 29 KYODO -- The chief of the largest 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) called Sunday [29 May] 
on the minority government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to 
resign en masse before the summit meeting of the Group of Seven 
(G-7) major industrial countries in Naples in July. 
  LDP President Yohei Kono said during a lecture in Niigata, 
north of Tokyo, "what can the minority ruling government promise 
at the G- 7 summit meeting? Can it carry out what it has 
decided? We must consider whom we can dispatch to the 
international community with responsibility." 
  Kono told reporters after the lecture that he supports an 
early dissolution of the House of Representatives for a snap 
general election, saying the current government does not reflect 
the opinion of the people shown at the general election last 
summer. 
  The president of the LDP, which was ousted from power for 
the 
first time in 38 years by the coalition last August, also said 
his party and the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) 
[SDPJ], the second largest opposition party which withdrew from 
the ruling coalition in April, share the view that the minority 
government should be replaced. 
  Former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the LDP said 
Sunday it would be difficult for the LDP to form a coalition 
government with the SDPJ as the majority of its members are 
supported by labor unions. 
  "The majority of SDPJ members of parliament depend on labor 
unions (for their seats)," Watanabe said during a Japan 
Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) television program. "So it is 
practically impossible to form a coalition unless agreement is 
reached with labor unions." 
  Watanabe, who heads the third largest LDP faction, said "it 
is also wrong to think dividing the SDPJ would be easy" to form 
a coalition with some SDPJ lawmakers. 
  The LDP's main support still lies among leading business 
circles, while the SDPJ draws its strength from Japan's labor 
unions. 
  On prospects for the timing of a general election, Watanabe 
said it is reasonable that the next general election be held 
under the new electoral system since only the passing of a bill 
is needed for demarcating the boundaries of a new single-seat 
electoral map. 
  Watanabe said, however, that Hata has "the arbitrary right 
to 
dissolve" the Diet, suggesting an election might be held under 
the current multiseat system. 
  The Diet in January legislated a package of electoral reform 
bills replacing the current multiseat system for the lower house 
with a mix of single-seat electorates and proportional 
representation. 
  An independent panel of experts is currently dividing the 
nation's multiseat constituencies into 300 single-seat districts. 
  LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori showed understanding of 
SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama's call for an agreement between 
ruling and opposition parties to hold a general election under 
the current system, delaying the introduction of the new 
electoral system until the following general election. 
  Mori told a news conference in Sapporo, Hokkaido, in 
northern 
Japan, that "it is one idea that the leaders of responsible 
parties gather and take such a measure (as Murayama offered)," 
suggesting his willingness to cooperate with the SDPJ. 
  Mori also said the LDP should cope with a general election 
under the current electoral system "if Hata dissolves (the Diet) 
of his own accord." 
  Three senior LDP legislators said Sunday if the Hata cabinet 
resigns en masse, the LDP may nominate a non-LDP candidate as 
premier. 
  Former Construction Minister Taku Yamasaki, former Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Koichi Kato and former Posts and 
Telecommunications Minister Junichiro Koizumi made the 
suggestion on an Asahi TV program. The trio have created a new 
policy study group. 
  Yamasaki said, "(the next government) will be a caretaker 
cabinet until the next general election and will be a de facto 
coalition cabinet of the LDP and the SDPJ. But it will be 
difficult for a candidate from the two parties to assume the 
premiership." 
  "Michio Watanabe will be a strong candidate (if he quits the 
party and becomes an independent)," Yamasaki said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 28 KYODO -- The leader of the second 
largest opposition party urged Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to 
resign along with his cabinet or dissolve the House of 
Representatives, signaling greater resolve among the opposition 
camp to unseat the ruling coalition government. 
  Hata's minority government has no other options, said Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, speaking at 
the beginning of a two-day session of the party's 
decision-making Central Committee. 
  Hata can choose to either have his cabinet resign en masse 
and establish a new coalition framework that includes the SDP, 
or he can dissolve the lower house, hold a general election and 
form a new government based on the voters' will, Murayama said. 
  The SDP must move to return to power, Murayama said, but 
added it should not be understood that the party would 
participate in the current Hata administration. 
  A draft action plan to be officially endorsed at the meeting 
stresses that the Hata cabinet opt for resigning en masse and a 
new coalition government be established. 
  But Murayama's remarks emphasized a greater resolve for the 
holding of a general election. 
  Murayama said the SDP should gather together "social 
democratic and liberal" forces centering on the party's 
cooperation with New Party Sakigake [Harbinger], led by former 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. 
  Murayama hinted he would be willing to cooperate with 
elements of the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP), saying there are some LDP members who seek to protect the 
war-renouncing constitution. 
  He also said the SDP should seek cooperation with two ruling 
coalition parties -- Komeito and the Democratic Socialist Party 
(DSP). 
  The SDP was the largest force in the coalition government 
until it bolted the alliance last month after a new Diet bloc 
was created by the coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party], former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's Japan 
New Party and the DSP. 
  The SDP's departure left Hata with Japan's first minority 
government in four decades.

  [Text] Fukuoka, May 30 KYODO -- An opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) leader called Monday [30 May] for 
top-level talks among the leadership of major political parties 
to address the unstable political situation. 
  The call was made by Koichi Kato, head of the LDP policy 
study group Shinseiki, during a press conference in Fukuoka, 
western Japan. Kato said talks among Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata and the leaders of the LDP, the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) and new party Sakigake should commence soon after the 
passage through the Diet of the government's fiscal 1994 budget 
legislation. 
  Kato said the party leaders should also discuss how to 
ensure that Japan presents a credible performance at the Group 
of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations summit in Naples, Italy in 
July. 
  Taku Yamasaki, a member of the same LDP subgroup also 
attending the press conference, suggested a general election 
could be held with the current multiseat constituency system for 
the House of Representatives. 
  He said chances are that the lower house will be dissolved 
and a general election held probably on July 24. 
  Former Posts and Telecommunications Minister Junichiro 
Koizumi predicted at the same news conference that a 
no-confidence motion against the Hosokawa cabinet will be 
submitted either June 27 or 28 and a general election would be 
held either july 24 or july 31.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 29 KYODO -- The second largest 
opposition Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] 
adopted a declaration Sunday [29 May] calling for general 
elections in case the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
resigns en bloc voluntarily. 
  The declaration by the SDPJ's central committee came at the 
end of a two-day meeting in Tokyo. 
  The SDPJ is demanding the disbanding of Hata's fragile 
minority coalition government and the formation of a new 
coalition supported by a majority of parties, including itself. 
  The SDPJ did not join the Hata government when it was formed 
a month ago after his predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, backed by 
the party, resigned in a dispute over the former premier's 
personal financial dealings.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- A top government official 
expressed hope Friday [27 May] that a burgeoning campaign to 
drum up support for enactment of a redistricting bill before the 
next general election is held might scare the opposition away 
from submitting a no-confidence motion against the 
administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  The signature-gathering campaign "has made it difficult for 
them to table a no-confidence motion before bills for political 
reform are legislated," the official said on condition of 
anonymity. 
  Although the Diet enacted bills in January to replace the 
current multiseat electoral system in the 511-seat House of 
Representatives with a mixture of 300 single-seat electorates 
and proportional representation, enactment of a redistricting 
bill must be in place before an election can be held under the 
new system. 
  He said opposition moves to force the administration to call 
an early election under the current multiseat system could be 
scuttled by a growing intraopposition rift over the wisdom of 
forcing a vote before an electoral redistricting bill is passed. 
  He said that as many as 42 Liberal Democratic Party 
legislators and 21 Social Democratic Party [of Japan -- SDPJ] 
lawmakers have signed the petition objecting to the holding of 
elections before the redistricting bill. 
  At present, the LDP and SDPJ leaderships are studying a 
strategy of submitting a no-confidence motion immediately after 
the Diet passes the long-overdue fiscal 1994 state budget. 
  The official said that, meanwhile, the ruling coalition is 
stepping up its efforts to convince the SDPJ to return to the 
fold of the anti-LDP coalition. 
  The SDPJ stormed out of the coalition April 26 after 
coalition parties abruptly announced a decision to form a new 
parliamentary bloc in the lower chamber excluding the SDPJ. The 
withdrawal rendered the Hata administration to a fragile 
minority government. 
  "The time will come when we will review the current 
combination of coalition parties without having it entail the 
disbandment of the whole cabinet," the official said. 
  He said the coalition "would not be able to accomplish tax 
system reforms if it remains a minority government," in apparent 
reference to a controversial agenda of raising the rate of the 3 
percent consumption tax. 
  In a related development, a leader of the Democratic 
Socialist Party, a minor coalition partner, blasted the 
opposition for plotting to scuttle the Hata administration 
before the redistricting bill is enacted. 
  "The righteous political argument is that the general 
election should be called after the electoral redistricting bill 
is legislated," DSP Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa said. 
  "If (the LDP and SDPJ leaderships) try to force the election 
under the multiseat constituency system, each of the two parties 
would face intraparty dissenting voices who will rap such moves 
as attempts to crush political reform," he said. 
  Proponents of the single-seat system have argued the system 
would clear up Japan's money-dominated politics, as it would 
eliminate the intense competition among candidates from the same 
party as seen under the current multiseat system. 
  Critics of the single-seat system argue, however, that it 
would intensify the race among only a few candidates seeking to 
grab the sole available seat, thereby tempting candidates to 
wine and dine voters or raise murky funds to cuddle voters.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
on Monday [30 May] hinted at his party's preparedness to form a 
coalition with the No. 1 opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP). 
  "I do not have any vengeance (against the LDP) at all. Such 
an option is possible," Hata told the House of Representatives 
Budget Committee. 
  Hata, the leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a core 
party in the ruling coalition, was responding to an LDP 
questioner who urged the prime minister to consider the 
possibility of "forming a conservative coalition with the LDP" 
by giving up any vengeful feelings he may still hold toward the 
party. 
  However, Hata quickly added his reservations over the 
proposal, saying, "if we put priority on forcing political 
stability alone, it would not change Japan's politics." 
  Japan "needs to go through the process of devastating the 
vestiges of the (LDP's) long hold on power," he said. 
  The premier made the comments as his minority government is 
facing a possible no-confidence motion by either the LDP or the 
Social Democratic Party that could scuttle his minority 
government. 
  The minority coalition accounts for 178 out of the 511-seat 
lower chamber. Shinseito has a parliamentary strength of 61. 
If combined with the 206 LDP legislators, such a conservative 
alliance would hold 267 seats -- well above the majority. 
  The mass defection of former LDP members who later formed 
Shinseito stripped the LDP of its majority in the lower chamber 
last June, putting an end to the party's 38-year grip on power. 
  In a related development, Hata expressed his willingness to 
hold separate summit talks with the leaders of the opposition 
parties. 
  "I am always ready. I am so even before or after the 
parliamentary passage of the (state) budget," he told a group of 
reporters in the Diet building.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Former Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa on Monday [30 May] cautioned the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ] against its move to try 
and reestablish its presence in the government, either as part 
of the ruling coalition or in an alliance with the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP). 
  "Although there's speculation that the SDP will join a third 
coalition government by returning to the fold or it may form a 
grand alliance with the LDP to force a dissolution of the House 
of Representatives, while the multiseat constituency system is 
still in place, such moves would be contrary to the momentum of 
history," he said. 
  Hosokawa was speaking about recent political developments at 
a party in a Tokyo hotel to mark the establishment of the Tokyo 
chapter of the Japan New Party [JNP], which he founded in 1992. 
  The statements were Hosokawa's first public remarks since 
the 
administration of his successor, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, 
was launched April 25 following Hosokawa's fall from grace amid 
allegations about his shadowy personal finances. 
  The speech came shortly before an alleged rightist assailant 
fired a shot in the Keio Plaza Hotel. The assailant, Masakatsu 
Nozoe, was quickly overpowered and later claimed shooting at the 
ceiling in a show of protest against Hosokawa. 
  "Although the withdrawal of the SDP from the ruling 
coalition 
was prompted by the formation of the unified parliamentary bloc, 
Kaishin (Innovation), it constituted a part of the historical 
adjustment process of the 1955 system," Hosokawa said. 
  The 1955 system refers to the fundamental power balance of 
the LDP-led conservative political camp and the SDP-led 
left-leaning opposition camp, which had been in place since 
1955, when the LDP was formed from the merger of the Liberal 
Party and the Democratic Party. 
  Hosokawa refuted allegations that the days of the Japan New 
Party are numbered due to public disillusion with the party 
following the Hosokawa scandal. 
  "If the public thinks that the JNP's role no longer exists 
due to the fall of the Hosokawa administration, we have to stir 
up our courage against such a perception," he said. 
  The JNP made an impressive debut on the national political 
scene during last July's general election, when the party won 35 
seats in the powerful lower chamber after its anticorruption 
campaign attracted corruption-weary voters.

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in 
Japanese at 2236 GMT, in its "News 2001" program, carries a 
25-minute interview with Masanori Goto, deputy secretary-general 
of the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), by moderator 
Yuji Kuroiwa, Keio University professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi, and 
political commentator Kenichi Takemura at the FNN studio in 
Tokyo. 
  At 2238 GMT, after citing FNN poll results that show a 
majority of SDPJ members want to return to the coalition, 
Kuroiwa asks for Goto's opinion on the results. 
  Goto says: "In the current political situation, a political 
party cannot justify its existence if it does not participate in 
the administration. In this sense, it is natural that the SDPJ 
should want to participate in the coalition." 
  But he adds: "This does not mean, though, the SDPJ will 
return to the second coalition government in its present form." 
  Kobayashi says the SDPJ may need very persuasive reasons to 
justify its decision to return to the coalition. Goto replies 
that the SDPJ will make efforts to get the party's policy 
reflected in the coalition administration. 
  Kuroiwa then cites criticism of the party leadership for its 
inconsistent political stance. Goto refutes the criticism, 
saying the SDPJ is only trying to be responsible. 
  Goto is then asked why the SDPJ participated in the former 
Hosokawa administration when it experienced difficulties and was 
forced to make many painful compromises. He says the party 
played a significant role on various issues, including rice and 
tax reform. 
  Asked about the SDPJ's position on returning to the 
coalition, Goto says: "It would be meaningless to call for the 
dissolution of the House of Representatives to hold a general 
election under the current multiseat electoral district system." 
  He says the SDPJ will return to the coalition if the Hata 
cabinet resigns en masse to establish a new coalition government. 
  He says: "It is necessary for the SDPJ to conclude a new 
policy agreement with the new coalition. If such an agreement 
is reached, it would be possible for the SDPJ to join." 
  And if agreement is reached, he says, Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata need not step down because the SDPJ would not rule out the 
possibility of him heading the new cabinet. 
  Takemura joins the discussion, voicing support for the 
SDPJ's 
stand on returning to the coalition. 
  Kuroiwa asks about the conditions on which the SDPJ would 
return to the coalition, and Kobayashi cites the results of an 
FNN poll conducted among SDPJ Diet members. Results of the poll 
show SDPJ members want the alliance between Shinseito (Japan 
Renewal Party) Secretary-General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito 
Secretary-General Yuichi Ichikawa dissolved; the "Kaishin" floor 
group disbanded; transparency in the policy-making process; and 
a cabinet resignation or reshuffle. 
  Goto notes the need to ensure transparency in policy-making, 
saying: "There has been criticism of the closed nature of the 
meeting of ruling party representatives. Open discussions 
should be held not only by party chairmen and secretaries 
general, but also by several executives from each party." 
  Goto is asked why the SDPJ is trying to return to the 
coalition. 
  He says: "It is necessary for us to join the administration 
to uphold and implement our policy proposals in a concrete form." 
  Kobayashi expresses concern that the SDPJ may not be able to 
maintain its policies in the coalition. Goto tries to dispel 
the concern, saying the SDPJ will make efforts to coordinate 
differences in opinion among the ruling parties.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Komeito Secretary General 
Yuichi Ichikawa urged the Social Democratic Party [of Japan, 
SDPJ] Monday [30 May] to present "more realistic terms" in 
seeking to rejoin the ruling coalition. 
  Ichikawa, arch ally of coalition architect Ichiro Ozawa, 
told 
a news conference, "I cannot approve of a reconfiguration of the 
current administration only to achieve the goal of enticing the 
SDP back into the coalition fold." 
  The veteran politician was commenting on a decision by the 
SDP during a meeting in Tokyo of local representatives 
nationwide to try to reintegrate itself into the government if 
the current coalition agrees to replace its cabinet lineup with 
a new one. 
  The SDP meeting adopted the strategy of forcing Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata to disband his minority cabinet by 
offering to marshal 74 SDP legislators behind his administration 
and transform it into a stable majority government. 
  The SDP stormed out of the coalition on April 26 over the 
secret formation of a large non-SDP parliamentary voting bloc in 
the House of Representatives. 
  Ichikawa expressed opposition to an SDP threat to support a 
possible no-confidence motion against the Hata administration 
unless Hata agrees to voluntarily disband his cabinet. 
  A no-confidence motion, if approved by a majority of the 
lower chamber, would force Hata to choose between disbanding the 
cabinet or calling a snap general election. 
  "Forcing a dissolution of the lower chamber while the 
current 
multiseat constituency system is still in place would amount to 
crushing reform, whatever rationale they may cite for it," he 
said. 
  Ichikawa expressed irritation at burgeoning rumors that some 
quarters in the SDP may take advantage of the popularity of 
incumbent Hokkaido Gov. Takahiro Yokomichi to marshal liberal 
and left-leaning politicians behind him in a new political party. 
  Yokomichi "should give up the governorship immediately by 
suspending his term as governor responsible for administration 
for the prefecture of Hokkaido, if he wants to enter the central 
political community," he said. 
  "Unless Yokomichi speaks from his heart (about the political 
agenda), it is pointless to speculate (on his move)," Ichikawa 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- The four-legislator group 
Minshu no Kaze (Democratic Wind), a breakaway from the Japan New 
Party [JNP], on Tuesday [31 May] joined an 18-member 
parliamentary group consisting of New Party Sakigake [Harbinger] 
and the Group Seiun in the House of Representatives. 
  Minshu no Kaze defected from the JNP, which is headed by 
former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, due to differences with 
the party leadership. 
  Sakigake, a 15-member party, is headed by Masayoshi 
Takemura, 
former chief cabinet secretary in the preceding coalition 
government. 
  The three-member Seiun, also a breakaway from the JNP, left 
after Hosokawa failed to carry out a planned merger with 
Sakigake. 
  Political sources said there are still some members within 
the JNP who are opposed to the leadership's close ties with the 
key coalition party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] led by Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  They predicted that the division within the JNP could lead 
more breakaways to join the 22-member parliamentary group 
comprising Sakigake, Seiun and Minshu no Kaze.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
has provided a total of 200 million yen to his Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] as political funds, according to Hata's report on 
his assets Tuesday [31 May]. 
  Hata has donated to Shinseito through his fund-raising 
organization "Shinwakai," starting with a 20 million yen 
contribution to Hata's newly created faction in the Liberal 
Democratic Party in January 1993, immediately after he launched 
his own group, according to Hata's Secretary Akira Makabe. 
  Hata's 50 million yen loan from banks, revealed in his 
financial report, was lent to Shinwakai, and part of the money 
was further donated to Shinseito, said Makabe, who also works 
for Shinwakai. 
  It was the first, albeit partial, disclosure of Shinseito's 
fund resources. 
  Shinseito, a key party in the ruling coalition headed by 
Hata, is scheduled to disclose the balance sheet on its 
political financing in September. 
  Moriyoshi Sato, director general of the Hokkaido and Okinawa 
Development Agencies, who handled the party financing, said he 
also borrowed 100 million yen from banks last October and lent 
50 million yen to the party. 
  "Mr. Hata and Mr. (Ichiro) Ozawa are lending to the party 
with borrowed money," he said. Ozawa is Shinseito's secretary 
general and the main strategist in the coalition.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- The aggregate value of 
personal assets of ministers in Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's 
cabinet is 2.4 times that of the cabinet of his predecessor, 
Morihiro Hosokawa, according to KYODO NEWS SERVICE calculations 
based on figures announced by the ministers. 
  The political offices of Hata and his 20 ministers, as well 
as former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano who quit the cabinet 
over an outcry following his remarks contradicting Japan's 
wartime atrocities, announced their asset values on Tuesday [31 
May] in line with a decade-long custom in Japan's political 
community. 
  The Hata administration became the 14th administration to 
reveal the asset values of its cabinet ministers in accordance 
with the custom initiated by the 1984 cabinet of Prime Minister 
Yasuhiro Nakasone amid public pressure on politicians to clarify 
their personal finances. 
  The total of the voluntarily-disclosed value of land and 
other fixed asset property, stock and bond holdings and bank 
savings held by the ministers stood at 3.22 billion yen, 
according to the self- assessment. 
  However, these figures -- calculated on the basis of the 
face 
value of stock and a special official format used in the 
calculation of tax amounts -- do not reflect the realities of 
the land and stock market. 
  The real aggregate value of the assets of Hata's ministers 
amounts to 13.33 billion yen, according to the KYODO 
calculations. 
  The aggregate asset value of the Hata cabinet turned out to 
be more than double that of the Hosokawa cabinet, as Hata and 
nine other ministers are former defectors from the Liberal 
Democratic Party who used to draw their financial strength from 
cash-heavy corporate contributors, political analysts said. 
  The aggregate assets held by the 10 former LDP rebels and 
held in the names of their family members accounted for 13.4 
billion yen or 88 percent of the 15.26 billion yen held by the 
21 cabinet ministers and their families. 
  The asset value of the Hosokawa cabinet was unusually low in 
comparison with previous administrations, partly because several 
Social Democratic Party legislators were incorporated into the 
cabinet lineup. 
  These SDP cabinet ministers stormed out of Hata's ruling 
coalition on April 26 after coalition strategists suddenly 
formed a unified parliamentary voting bloc excluding the SDP in 
the House of Representatives. 
  Labor Minister Kunio Hatoyama, a former LDP veteran, topped 
the list of ministers as the most wealthy minister with his 
KYODO- assessed asset value coming to 8.46 billion yen. 
Hatoyama is now an independent. 
  His stock holdings accounted for 5.77 billion yen, while his 
savings stood at 1.75 billion yen. The remaining portion 
comprises his real estate, and golf club membership certificates 
at five country clubs that could be cashed at any time. 
  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, another ex-LDP rebel who 
joined Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], ranked second with 875 
million yen, followed by Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa 542 
million yen. 
  Kakizawa's real estate value provides an example of a gulf 
between the self-assessed value and the real market value. 
  The self-declared value of his Tokyo home, office and 
residential land stood at 38 million yen, while their market 
value came to 533 million yen, according to the KYODO probe. 
  The premier himself ranked 13th in the list with his asset 
value totaling 150 million yen. This compares with Hosokawa's 
1.3 billion yen. One of the conspicuous features of his asset 
makeup was his investment in overseas investment trusts. 
  The latest announcement by the premier's office disclosed 
that he failed to report in 1993 debts of 70 million yen when he 
declared his asset value when serving as foreign minister in the 
Hosokawa administration. 
  The Hata administration initially proposed to media 
organizations that Hata and six other cabinet ministers who held 
cabinet posts in the previous Hosokawa administration be spared 
the obligation to declare their asset values. 
  The administration withdrew the proposal after it came under 
criticism for an alleged attempt to neglect the obligation to 
show public transparency regarding their personal finances. 
  Political analysts said the loopholes in the reporting 
requirement should be plugged in order to enable the public to 
assess the real situation concerning the personal finances of 
politicians. 
  The requirement cannot clarify the process of personal 
asset- 
amassing, such as Hosokawa's controversial purchase of 300 
shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. which he said he 
helped his father-in-law buy by pledging as collateral the 
condominium he purchased with a 100 million yen loan from a 
scandal-ridden trucking group, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Who deleted a description of 
a 20 million yen loan to the wife of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
from his 1993 asset disclosure report remains a mystery, the 
Foreign Ministry and his financial secretaries said Tuesday [31 
May]. 
  Hata submitted to news organizations his fiscal 1994 asset 
report that revived the deleted description of the 20 million 
yen loan to his wife Yasuko from her father. 
  Hata's political office said although it incorporated the 
description of the loan in last September's report, someone 
removed the account from the photocopies of the report later 
distributed to the mass media. 
  "We do not know why that description was deleted from the 
copies of the report distributed to the press," said an official 
at the political office. 
  The office said Yasuko borrowed the money to finance part of 
the construction cost of Hata's private residence in Tokyo's 
Setagaya ward. 
  The deletion called into question political ethics of the 
premier who has been dubbed "Mr. Political Reform" since the 
days when Hata was a legislator of the Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP), political analysts said. 
  Hata's financial aide, Akira Makabe, told KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE, 
"I put the account of the loan onto the report after hearing its 
explanation from the premier's wife and then I handed it over to 
Mr. Yoichi Nishizawa, who was then serving as the political 
secretary to then Foreign Minister Hata." 
  Makabe gave KYODO a photocopy of the duplicate copy of the 
report carrying the description of the loan, which he said has 
been kept at the office. 
  However, Nishizawa told KYODO, "although I certainly 
received 
the report from Mr. Makabe, I do not remember whether it carried 
the description in question or not." 
  "I handed over the report to the ministry bureaucracy 
without 
tampering with it," he said. 
  The Foreign Ministry's General Affairs Division said the 
report was submitted to the Prime Minister's Office after it was 
ckecked by the Ministry's Personnel Division. 
  When the Prime Minister's Office distributed the photocopies 
of the report to reporters at the press club covering the 
premier's official residence, the submitted report's column for 
loans and debts was blank, the division said. 
  The analysts said the description was possibly deleted by 
either Hata's secretaries or bureaucrats, or the description 
that was nonexistent on the initially compiled report was later 
incorporated by someone. 
  Both Makabe and Nishizawa admitted it is hard to believe 
that 
bureaucrats deleted the description. 
  Meanwhile, Makabe acknowledged deleting another description 
of a separate 50 million yen loan from the premier's 1993 asset 
disclosure report. 
  The description was revived in this year's report. 
  The aide said Hata borrowed 50 million yen from Hachijuni 
Bank in his constituency of Nagano Prefecture last June 25 by 
pledging his 261-square-meter residence in Ueda, Nagano, as 
collateral. 
  Hata needed the money to shoulder mandatory contributions to 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], which he and his colleagues 
founded last June after defecting from the LDP, he said. 
  The money was channeled to the party from Hata's own 
fundraising organization, Shinwa-kai, to which Hata loaned the 
50 million yen, the money he had borrowed from Hachijuni Bank. 
  Makabe told KYODO, "I decided not to put the description of 
the loan onto the report with much hesitancy, as I thought 
Hata's borrowing the money is almost tantamount to the 
Shinwa-kai's borrowing the money. 
  "I should have incorporated the description of the loan onto 
the report, as it is the money borrowed by Hata," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- The head of the Democratic 
Socialist Party (DSP) is likely to step down soon over his part 
in a political maneuver that ended up leaving the ruling 
coalition without a Diet majority, party officials said Tuesday 
[31 May]. 
  DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi is tilting toward resigning, 
possibly by the weekend, and Takashi Yonezawa, party's general 
secretary, will probably succeed him, they said. 
  The DSP, a centrist component of the ruling coalition, will 
hold an emergency meeting of its policy-making board this week 
to discuss the issue, they said. 
  Ouchi has been under fire from rank-and-file party members 
and supporters for his role in creating the new Diet bloc 
Kaishin, which excluded the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] 
(SDP) [SDPJ], the largest party in the previous coalition 
government. 
  The SDPJ walked out of the coalition immediately after it 
helped to elect Tsutomu Hata as prime minister on April 25 as it 
saw the Ouchi-initiated move as a plot to reduce its influence 
on policy- making. 
  The parliamentary debacle greatly undermined Hata's 
political 
standing, and he has been the constant target of opposition 
calls for his resignation or snap elections since he came to 
office. 
  Ouchi has talked with the DSP leadership about the Kaishin 
and as a result is close to deciding to quit, party insiders 
said. 
  Party officials, however, are concerned that if Ouchi 
resigns 
to take responsibility for the Kaishin fiasco it could have 
unpleasant repercussions for the coalition. 
  Key coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] and former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa -- 
the other prime movers behind Kaishin -- could also come under 
fire, they said. That would further shake the 
already-sputtering coalition, they said. 
  Some young party members, on the other hand, are demanding 
that Ouchi make clear his responsibility for the Kaishin debacle. 
  Ouchi said at a Tuesday press conference that he is still 
consulting party colleagues and has yet to make a final decision 
on the issue.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
said Monday [30 May] that the independence of local governments 
must be strengthened to promote decentralization. 
  Hata was addressing the first meeting of a working group on 
decentralization of power under the administrative reform 
promotion headquarters. The working group, consisted of seven 
cabinet ministers and eight experts, is part of the reform 
promotion headquarters headed by Hata. 
  The headquarters, established by Hata's predecessor Morihiro 
Hosokawa, has set up three working groups -- on housing and 
land, information and communications, and import promotion, 
market access and distribution. Hata also told the meeting that 
promoting decentralization is a need of the time. 
  The group confirmed that it aims to draw up guidelines for 
decentralization by the end of the year.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 28 KYODO -- A government advisory panel 
studying the nation's overall development blueprint urges the 
government to take actual steps toward the relocation of the 
functions of the capital from Tokyo, according to the draft 
report by the panel obtained Saturday [28 May] by KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE. 
  The National Land Development Council also calls for a 
reprogramming of the government's development policy to enhance 
exchanges and alliances among regional communities, the draft 
report said. 
  The council's final report on its review on the nation's 
1987 
comprehensive development plan stressed the need for a 
reassessment of the traditional roles for the central and local 
governments as well as reorganizations of local communities. 
  The report, which should serve as the basis for the next 
development blueprint, is scheduled to be submitted to Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata on June 16 after approval by the council. 
  The report points to drastic changes in social conditions 
since the 1987 program, citing a declining birth rate, the 
dragging recession and the yen's upswing. 
  It advises the government to pay more attention to "exchange 
population," or the number of people who travel around at home 
or abroad. 
  As measures to boost local exchanges, it proposes the 
development of highways that connect local core cities, faster 
railway transportations, and new railway networks and better 
access to airports. 
  The council lauds proposed new corridors in the east and 
west 
Japan and along the Sea of Japan coastline as possible 
incubators for cross-regional intercourses. 
  In light of the increasing role that Japan should play in 
Asia, the report urges the creation of new economic areas 
surrounding the Sea of Japan or the Yellow Sea. 
  It also proposes nurturing "small global cities" that enjoy 
direct international exchanges in some specific fields. 
  To respond to the shift of production overseas by 
manufacturers and the increasing share of software industries, 
the report advocates the creation of higher-grade service 
industry through developing high-capacity, high-speed 
telecommunications networks utilizing the technology of optical 
fibers and telecommunications satellite. 
  The report also drew attention to environmental protection, 
and exhorts Japan's active involvement, not only domestically 
but globally, in the issue.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
said Monday [30 May] the yen could appreciate further against 
the dollar if Japan does not open its markets further and relax 
more government regulations. 
  Hata made the comment during a meeting with Shoichiro 
Toyoda, 
chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations 
(Keidanren), at his official residence, a Keidanren official 
said. 
  Toyoda urged Hata to finish work on the long-overdue fiscal 
1994 budget and carry out political reforms by redrafting the 
electoral map for single-seat districts. 
  Acknowledging deregulation is the Hata cabinet's priority, 
Toyoda pointed to the need to establish a system to monitor 
progress in relaxing government controls. 
  Hata replied that market opening and deregulation is a task 
Japan can accomplish on its own, but not one which can be done 
purely at the behest of foreign governments. 
  In other remarks, Hata reiterated that if snap elections are 
called, they should be held under the new system of single-seat 
districts. 
  Opposition parties are pressing Hata to resign or call snap 
elections as soon after the state budget goes through the Diet. 
They have threatened to submit a no-confidence motion against 
the minority Hata administration once the budget is passed.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
suggested Tuesday [31 May] that the government is considering 
introduction of a new local consumption tax to secure funds for 
social welfare in the aging society. 
  "A decision has to be made sooner or later," Hata told a 
session of the House of Representatives Budget Committee 
reviewing the long- delayed state budget for fiscal 1994, which 
began April 1. 
  The remark showed Hata's positive stance concerning such a 
new tax in line with the government's tax system reform program, 
observers said. 
  Government sources said, however, that the Finance Ministry 
opposes the idea for technical reasons, including complicated 
tax- collection procedures. 
  A local consumption tax would increase revenues of local 
governments and could be used to ease the burden of medical and 
other costs to care for aged residents. 
  Backing up Hata's remark, the head of the government's tax 
commission, Kan Kato, told reporters commission members have 
agreed on the need for new revenue sources, and the local tax 
idea cannot be ignored when a hike is implemented in the present 
3.0 percent consumption tax.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- A government advisory panel 
asked the Finance Ministry on Tuesday [31 May] to compile 
additional estimates on planned tax reform, the panel head said. 
  Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, an advisory forum 
to the prime minister, also stressed again that the ministry's 
estimates are just "mechanical calculations" for the panel to 
scrap and paste the conditions for its own models of tax reform, 
including permanent tax cuts and a consumption tax hike. 
  But panel members were inclined to accept the 10-year 
maturity presented by the ministry in its estimates last Friday 
for stopgap bonds slated to be floated to fund the planned 
three-year time lag between tax cuts and hikes, Kato told a news 
conference after a panel meeting. 
  "There are arguments the longest maturity (stipulated in 
law) 
is 60 years, but many members described the 10-year redemption 
as a responsible stance for the financial authorities," he said. 
  Kato said the ministry agreed to compile estimates for a tax 
hike of 4 percent to 6 percent at the next meeting, but he noted 
the 4-6 percent tax hikes do not comply with requests made to 
the panel by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  Hata's requests called for a net revenue increase through 
tax 
reform to fund an expected heavier burden on social welfare 
because of Japan's aging society. 
  The ministry report, submitted last Friday upon request to 
the panel and the ruling parties, estimates net revenues in 
fiscal 2000 after the 6.2 trillion yen in tax cuts are extended 
and the current 3 percent consumption tax is raised to 7 percent 
to 10 percent in April 1997. 
  But the ministry faced criticism over the estimates, which 
failed to include a tax hike to below 7 percent, a "natural" tax 
revenue increase, and possible effects from fiscal and 
administrative overhauls. 
  It also met criticism by setting conditions of redeeming 
stopgap bonds in 10 years and financing the expected increase in 
welfare spending entirely with the tax hike. The stopgap bonds 
are to fund the three-year time lag between tax cuts and the 
hike. 
  Kato said the panel also discussed the possibility of 
including estimates for boosting public works spending, 
squeezing the government burden on welfare spending, including a 
"natural" tax revenue increase and the effects of fiscal and 
administrative reforms. 
  But the panel found too many uncertainties to decide on 
anything yet, he said. 
  On administrative reform, Kato said he will meet Hata on 
Friday to confirm the government's policy. 
  Meanwhile, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said at an 
earlier 
news conference that the estimates had no "policy implications" 
by the ministry, particularly in guiding decisions on a tax hike 
to 7 percent at least. 
  Fujii said the estimates omitted all items that require 
policy decisions. 
  The panel chairman said the Friday meeting also covered the 
issue of regional tax revenue sources with members agreeing on 
the need for independent taxes by local governments. 
  But with the panel citing technical problems in adopting 
regional consumption, Kato said some "political decision" is 
necessary. 
  Under the current consumption tax system, the central 
government levies the entire 3 percent tax and distributes 39.2 
percent of the revenue to local governments. 
  The Ministry of Home Affairs submitted to the panel and the 
ruling parties its revenue estimates for local governments, 
featuring a revenue deficit of 5.4 trillion yen to 12.5 trillion 
yen in fiscal 2000 when funding heavier welfare spending under 
the current tax system. 
  The same estimates compiled by the Finance Ministry last 
Tuesday for the central government showed a deficit of 8.9 
trillion yen to 12.7 trillion yen. 
  The estimates do not include the planned tax reform.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 28 KYODO -- Domestically grown grain 
will account for 40 percent of the 500,000 tons of rice the 
government plans to sell in July, ministry sources said Saturday 
[28 May]. 
  The sources said the government will release 200,000 tons of 
domestic rice from its stockpiles in July, 50,000 tons more than 
was originally planned. 
  According to the Food Agency's new rice-supply plan, the 
proportion of domestic grain in the government's total supply 
will increase to 60 percent in August, 80 percent in September 
and more than that in October. 
  Currently, the ratio stands at just 30 percent. 
  The new plan will be officially adopted in early June after 
the agency briefs each prefecture. 
  Under the original plan, the ratio of domestic rice was put 
at 30 percent by the end of July. It was only in September that 
supplies of domestic grain exceed those of imports. 
  But following last year's devastating harvest, which forced 
Japan to buy foreign rice, farmers planted more early-harvested 
rice this year, prompting the government to add more domestic 
rice to its supplies in the coming months. 
  Some analysts are even concerned that supplies of domestic 
rice will become excessive from August to October, leaving large 
amounts of imported rice on the shelves. 
  A rice market official said, "if nothing is done, only 
domestic rice will be distributed around October and it will 
load wholesalers with large stocks of imported rice." 
  Already, some imported rice, mainly Thai rice, has been left 
unsold after the panic hoarding of domestically grown rice in 
March.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- The Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI) on Tuesday [31 May] 
unveiled a list of auto components cited by Japan's six minicar 
makers for a proposed parts unification program. 
  The program among the six carmakers -- Honda Motor Co., 
Mazda 
Motor Corp., Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., Mitsubishi Motors 
Corp., Suzuki Motor Corp. and Daihatsu Motor Co. -- is intended 
to trim their manufacturing costs for a minicar or vehicle with 
an engine displacement of 660 cc or less, MITI said. 
  Unified parts will total 84 out of 20,000 items usually 
needed to assemble one automobile, MITI said. 
  The proposed unification will cover most of the important 
auto component systems -- engines, electronics, lighting and 
measurement equipment, transmission, braking systems, body and 
attached equipment such as audio and air conditioners, MITI said. 
  MITI hopes parts makers will be cooperative with the 
industry 
plan, a MITI official told a news conference. 
  MITI proposed the latest program as a prescription for 
Japan's minicar makers to survive intensified price-cutting 
competition. 
  The program will help secure a stable parts supply for 
consumers while promoting auto parts standardization and curbing 
unnecessary model changeovers, the official said. 
  The auto and auto parts industries should formulate specific 
unification programs in a manner that would not cause problems 
under the Antitrust Law, the official said. 
  Transparency should be also ensured in selecting components 
subject to unification, the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 29 KYODO -- The ruling coalition's task 
force suggests that the government should set aside greater 
public works funds for improving the nation's social 
infrastructure to cope with a rapidly graying society. 
  The outline of the report, obtained by KYODO NEWS SERVICE 
Sunday, also says the government should consider making it 
mandatory to discontinue subsidies five or 10 years after they 
started to be given if no measures are taken to extend them. 
  The proposals are contained in a report worked out by a 
working group on public works projects and subsidies of the 
ruling coalition's Tax Reform Council. 
  The report is to be formally published early next month. 
  The panel is one of the four working groups the ruling 
coalition has created within its administrative and fiscal 
reform subcommittee. 
  The task force has since studied ways to slash public works 
spending and subsidies on the assumption that indirect tax rates 
will be raised to cope with a rapidly aging society. 
  On public works spending, the panel proposes that the 
government allocate greater funds to projects aimed primarily at 
improving social infrastructure, notably the quality of life. 
  In order to identify such projects, the coalition's 
committee 
on social infrastructure should come up with clear-cut policies, 
the panel says. 
  During discussions conducted so far, some members of the 
working group suggested that three government ministries and as 
many agencies be integrated into a public-works ministry. 
  The three ministries are the construction, agriculture, 
forestry and fisheries, and transport ministries while the three 
agencies are the national land, Hokkaido development and Okinawa 
development agencies. 
  The panel, however, failed to bring the matter to a 
conclusion because the proposal met with opposition from some 
members who maintained that efficiency would lower at such a 
large government ministry.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Japan's government 
ministries will examine the nation's system of public charges 
and compile a report perhaps by the end of June, ministers 
agreed Tuesday [31 May]. 
  Economic Planning Agency (EPA) chief Yoshio Terasawa told a 
regular news conference that ministers at a gathering after the 
morning cabinet meeting agreed to his proposal that the 
government broadly examine the system for setting such fees. 
  The EPA director general said his proposal followed up a 
general agreement for a project team to review the system in the 
wake of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's abrupt May 18 decision to 
freeze rate hikes for the rest of the year. 
  Each ministry and agency will inspect and report on the fee 
system within its jurisdiction, and the cabinet councillors' 
office on internal affairs within the prime minister's office 
will compile a general report for related cabinet members, 
Terasawa said. 
  He said the ministers have yet to decide how to handle the 
report but that Moriyoshi Sato, head of the Hokkaido and Okinawa 
Development Agencies, asked that they finish their work by the 
end of June. That is when the government has vowed to complete 
a set of market-opening and deregulation measures. 
  Farm Minister Mutsuki Kato also suggested comparing Japanese 
fees for such services as buses, subways and electric power with 
those in other countries, according to Terasawa.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- A Japanese Government 
advisory panel on Tuesday [31 May] proposed a three-stage scheme 
to build a nationwide optical-fiber telecommunications network 
by 2010 as part of efforts to facilitate the shift to an 
information-oriented society in the next century. 
  The scheme would create jobs for 2.43 million people by 
boosting Japan's multimedia market by 56 trillion yen to 123 
trillion yen by the targeted year, said the Telecommunications 
Council, an advisory body to the posts minister. 
  The council said the telecom project would help correct the 
over- centralization of information in Tokyo, quicken economic 
restructuring in Japan through the creation of new business and 
expand leisure time of the Japanese people as a result of an 
expected diffusion of "satellite" remote offices. 
  The scheme is also designed for the efficient use of natural 
resources and energy, contributing to a solution of 
environmental issues, one of the biggest global problems toward 
the 21st century. 
  In the recommendation presented to Posts and 
Telecommunications Minister Katsuyuki Hikasa, the council called 
for the laying of a core optical-cable network linking the 
prefectural capitals by 2000, in a first-phase project that 
would cover 20 percent of the nation's population. 
  A second-stage network should be built by 2005 to connect 
cities with populations of over 100,000 for a population 
coverage of 60 percent, the council said. 
  Nationwide hookup is set for the year of 2010 when Japan's 
population is expected to peak, it said. 
  Apart from the three-stage scheme, an optical cable network 
to link major public organs, like schools, libraries, hospitals 
and welfare facilities, should be built by 2000, accompanied by 
the development of application software for use at such 
institutions, the council said. 
  "Based on the council proposal, the posts ministry will push 
for various measures to implement the program, including further 
deregulation in telecom fields and an ample amount of budgetary 
allocation by the Finance Ministry, an official at the posts 
ministry told a press conference. 
  Tuesday's proposal has been apparently prompted by "the 
information superhighway scheme" unveiled earlier by the United 
States. 
  As under the U.S. scheme, the Japanese project is expected 
to 
provide a wide range of multimedia services in the next century, 
which the council says would make Japanese people's livelihood 
"dramatically more comfortable." 
  As possible multimedia services under the scheme, the 
council 
cited remote medical checking, video-on-demand services, home 
shopping, electronic libraries, virtual reality leisure parks, 
interactive access to administrative information and remote 
education services. 
  The proposed optical-fiber network is projected to cost 53 
trillion yen when the single-star (SS) system, the most 
sophisticated optical cable networking method, is used at 
subscribing companies and households, the council said. 
  The cost would be lower at 33 trillion yen if networking is 
done with a combination of the SS system and a less 
sophisticated system, a more practical approach in view of 
Japan's current technological level. 
  The council said the private sector should play a key role 
in 
developing related application software. But government support 
is also necessary in the inititial stage of networking that 
focuses on infrastructure improvement. 
  The task of laying the core part of the fiber cable network 
should be basically entrusted to either telecommunications 
companies like Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) or 
cable television operators, the council said. 
  The posts ministry official avoided stating a specific role 
by NTT in the fiber project, noting that further discussion 
needs to be conducted to decide who should take charge of the 
task. 
  "To create a business environment that maximizes competition 
among various sectors would eventually serve the interest of 
general users," the council said. 
  It said interest-free loans and tax incentives should be 
provided to entities participating in costly infrastructure 
improvement projects in the scheme. 
  The optical-fiber network scheme is most likely to produce 
various social, legal and security problems that the Japanese 
people have rarely experienced in the past -- those uniquely 
inherent in the nature of multimedia services. 
  Among them are an unintended violation of individual privacy 
and intellectual property rights. The legal framework should be 
upgraded to cope with these problems, the council said. 
  The council also called for the standardization of telecom 
equipment and systems in accordance with international standards. 
  The concept of "universal services" should be introduced for 
the new telecom scheme, in which services are equally offered 
across the nation at reasonable prices, the council said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Japan's three long-term 
credit banks are likely to lower their long-term prime lending 
rate on June 10 for the first cut in six months, banking sources 
said Monday [30 May]. 
  The sources said the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), the 
long- term credit bank, and Nippon Credit Bank are expected to 
cut the rate charged on loans to most-creditworthy customers by 
around 0.2 percentage point from the current 4.4 percent per 
annum. 
  They said the cut in the rate, which affects capital 
spending, may help underpin the economy. 
  The rate was boosted in February and March due to the slump 
of bond prices, but the market recovered thereafter, with the 
yield falling, buttressed by the Bank of Japan's eased credit 
stance. 
  The yield of the May issue of bank debentures issued by the 
IBJ, the basis for the long-term prime rate, dropped to 3.24 
percent Monday, against its coupon rate of 3.5 percent. 
  The coupon rate of the bank debentures is revised when the 
gap between it and the yield widens more than 0.2 point. 
  The long-term prime rate is set 0.9 point above the coupon 
rate of the debentures. 
  The sources also said the housing loan rate charged by 
private banks, linked to the long-term prime rate, will be left 
unchanged, however, due to the small scale of the cut.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- The government's key 
economic forecasting gauge surged above the boom-or-bust line of 
50 percent in March for the third straight month, the Economic 
Planning Agency (EPA) said Tuesday [31 May]. 
  However, an EPA official downplayed the significance of the 
latest data and pointed to the need to see statistics making up 
the index in the coming months before deciding whether the 
economy is getting back on the recovery path. 
  The index of leading indicators, designed to forecast 
economic trends three to six months down the road, rose to 90.9 
percent in March from a revised 54.2 percent in February. 
  The index was first reported at 45 percent for February. The 
upward revision reflects positive figures on a backlog for 
construction orders and business sentiment among small and 
medium- sized companies, which were not included in preliminary 
data. 
  In theory, the EPA considers a reading above 50 as a sign 
that the economy will expand in the near future but a level 
below 50 as heralding contraction. 
  The EPA remains cautious about painting a bright picture of 
the state of the economy, though, since two other indexes 
released together with the leading index contained negative 
findings. 
  "Despite positive movements in the leading index, basic 
movements in the indexes reflect the fact that the national 
economy remains sluggish," the EPA said in a report. 
  The index of coincident indicators, a measure of the state 
of 
the economy, stayed above 50 percent in March for the first time 
in two months, rising to 90.0 percent from a revised 30.0 
percent in February. 
  The index of lagging indicators, which gauges the economic 
performance in the recent past, fell below 50 percent for six 
months in a row, staying at 28.6 percent against a preliminary 
0.0 percent in February.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 28 KYODO -- The prolonged recession has 
boosted the number of unemployed workers to a 10-year high of 
1.94 million, a government report said Saturday [28 May]. 
  The Management and Coordination Agency said the figure, 
based 
on its survey conducted in February, represented an increase of 
370,000 or 23.6 percent over a year earlier. 
  The agency said the number of employed increased 170,000 to 
62.9 million. 
  It said the number of jobless was the highest since 1984 
when 
the agency began the annual survey on the labor situation. 
  Agency officials said the number of employed and unemployed 
was estimated on the basis of polls taken on about 100,000 
people more than 15 years old in the survey conducted in 
February this year. 
  The survey showed that the number of unemployed on a job 
hunt 
accounted for 1.29 million, the agency said. 
  It said male workers who lost jobs as a result of 
reorganization or bankruptcies totaled 70,000, accounting for 
9.1 percent of the total number of jobless males, up from the 
previous year's 7.8 percent. 
  The figure for females stood at 60,000, accounting for 11.5 
percent, up from 7.0 percent the year before, the agency said. 
  The agency said those who were unemployed for less than 
three 
months accounted for 44.3 percent of the total, down 6.0 
percentage points from the year before. 
  In contrast, the agency said those who were unemployed for 
three- six months and more than one year climbed 4.2 and 1.2 
percentage points to 20.1 percent and 16.5 percent. 
  The survey showed that 2.53 million workers took up new jobs 
over the past one year, with 26.9 percent changing jobs in 
search of better conditions. 
  Those who were forced to seek new jobs as a result of 
restructuring and business failures increased 2.9 percentage 
points to 8.3 percent, the agency said. 
  The agency said job changing workers decreased 160,000 in 
the 
manufacturing industry and 20,000 in the wholesale-retail and 
restaurant sector while those in service and construction 
industries increased 130,000 and 100,000, respectively. 
  It said 7.11 million workers said they want to find new jobs 
with better job security.

  [Excerpt] Singapore has applauded U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's decision on Friday to renew China's Most Favoured 
Nation [MFN] status. 
  "It was the right thing to do," said Deputy Prime Minister 
Lee Hsien Loong yesterday. 
  "I am glad the President took the hard but right decision," 
he told reporters when he officiated at NTUC's [National Trade 
Union Congress] May Day Family Gathering at the Singapore 
Zoological Gardens. 
  In a turn-around of policy, Mr Clinton also announced that 
he 
would sever the link between China's MFN status and human 
rights. He had imposed the improvement of China's human rights 
record as a condition for MFN renewal. 
  He is now facing pressure from American legislators, 
including those from his own Democratic Party who are enraged by 
his about- face on China. 
  NTUC chief Lim Boon Heng, who was also present at the NTUC 
function, also welcomed the move: "Any measure that promotes 
world trade will be good for Singapore. Singapore entrepreneurs 
should take advantage of the better business climate in China."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "China needs to reciprocate"] </F>
  [Text] It would be bad taste to consider President Bill 
Clinton's decision to extend Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) trading 
status to China for another year as a case of eating humble pie. 
It was painful to have to acknowledge that he had been wrong to 
use the trade bludgeon to improve human rights in China. Saying 
the policy had "outlived its usefulness" would not fool those 
who had tracked this doomed approach, but it was the best 
construction that could be put on a policy blunder. But Mr. 
Clinton was honest; credit due to him for that would, it is 
hoped, ease the disappointment of having to endure another 
setback in a spell of political and personal reverses. For 
China, there must be immense satisfaction that it has bent 
America to its will on the cold logic of economics and its 
strategic importance to a world which has discarded one by one 
the old assumptions valid during the era of the U.S.-Soviet 
contest. But it should not gloat. The MFN tussle was not a 
chess game to determine which of the two countries could 
manoeuvre more smartly. China prevailed in spite of itself; its 
harsh treatment of citizens who disagree openly with the 
government cannot continue, with or without the censure of world 
opinion. Rather, what this episode proved was that despite 
mutual distaste -- over America's meddlesome policies and 
China's intrusive policing of its citizenry -- the U.S. and 
China need to seek a form of accomodation that will stand them 
in good stead into the next century. China can be a benign 
force for stability in the Asia- Pacific region: exerting 
pressure on North Korea to minimise the nuclear risk, its 
vibrant growth spreading prosperity down to Indochina and 
Southeast Asia, economic expansion taking the sting out of 
whatever hegemonic intensions it may have. 
  Recognising that withholding trade privileges would bring 
misery to millions of workers in China, Hong Kong and the U.S. 
in return for minimal gains in human rights compliance would, 
one hopes, bring about a new enlightenment in America's 
relations with big and potentially powerful nations. Economic 
need now surpasses pure ideology. That has been much conceded 
by Mr. Clinton with the tacit disavowal of his executive order 
linking renewed MFN to "significant progress" in China's 
handling of human rights issues. Consider some numbers -- 182 
countries enjoy MFN with the U.S. with only nine denied it; 
150,000 American jobs will be in jeopardy if China could sell 
only a fraction of the U.S.$33 billion worth of goods it sold to 
the U.S. last year. 
  For people in Asia, relief that a collision has been averted 
must be tempered by this realisation: as much as Mr. Clinton's 
backdown will not be cost-free where his domestic standing and 
re-election chances are concerned, China needs to return the 
favour. That simply means that it has to treat its people 
better. Torture, disappearances in the night, inhumane 
incarceration, now an embarrassment, would be unacceptable 
infractions as China comes up in the world. The White House 
National Security Adviser, Mr. Anthony Lake, was not trying to 
salvage a bad situation when he said the American spotlight on 
human rights had concentrated Chinese minds on the issue. 
America did make a candid contribution. Mr. Clinton says his 
country will persist with the crusade. With the linkage with 
trade removed, it all looks more palatable. Asian countries, on 
their part, have to use moral persuasion and quiet diplomacy to 
impress upon China the need to reciprocate America's gesture by 
taking the brutishness out of its treatment of political 
prisoners. But a distinction has to be made: using human rights 
as a cover for imposing so-called minimum labour standards as a 
means of cancelling out the developing world's advantage must be 
exposed for what it is. The U.S. and France, egged on by 
certain human rights watchdog groups, have kept this on the 
backburner despite a roasting they received at the GATT 
conference in Morocco recently. But it will not go away.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of the joint communique of the roundtable </F>
meeting held in Pyongyang on 27 and 28 May 1994] 
  [Text] A joint communique was issued at the conclusion the 
roundtable meeting held under the lofty royal chairmanship of 
King Norodom Sihanouk. The following are the main points of the 
communication: 
  1. The meeting unanimously agreed to always faithfully 
support and defend a unified Cambodia without division of 
territory and with territorial integrity, including its 
terrestrial and maritime borders and islands recognized and 
respected internationally between 1963 and 1968; and Cambodia's 
national ideals of peace, solidarity, unity, independence, and 
progress in the reconstruction of Cambodia. 
  The meeting realized that territorial and national unity 
without territorial partition is a must for preserving national 
identity. 
  2. Based on the king's concrete proposal, all of the 
participants pledged to do their best to achieve national 
reconciliation and peace so as to end the fighting quickly. 
  3. The meeting agreed to form a roundtable committee for 
national reconciliation and peace to continue the process of 
seeking a solution to the issue of achieving national 
reconciliation and unification. 
  The participants also agreed that the committee would begin 
its first meeting in Phnom Penh on 15 June 1994. 
  The roundtable meeting concluded on 28 May in an atmosphere 
of mutual understanding and with a high sense of responsibility 
for the destiny of the Cambodian nation and people.

<F P=106> ["Press communique of the Office of the Royal Government's </F>
Spokesman concerning the roundtable meeting" issued in Pyongyang 
on 28 May -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] The roundtable meeting was held from 27 to 28 May 
1994 at the Chhanghsu-on Royal Residence in Pyongyang, the DPRK, 
under the lofty chairmanship of His Majesty King Norodom 
Sihanouk Varaman, king of the Kingdom of Cambodia [KoC] with the 
participation of Samdech Chea Sim, chairman of the National 
Assembly; Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun 
Sen, first and second prime ministers of the KoC and 
co-commanders in chief of the Khmer Royal Armed forces [KRAF]; 
and Khieu Samphan, head of the Khmer Rouge delegation. 
  Attending the meeting as observers were members of the 
King's 
Council and especially the two Buddhist supreme patriarchs, 
Venerable Mongkol Teppeacha, and Venerable Moha Khousananda. 
  The KoC, representing a legal and legitimate institution 
established through the free and fair elections in May 1993, 
concretely responded to His Majesty's initiative for the 
roundtable. 
  This manifests the KoC delegation's strong support, full of 
unswerving goodwill, for the King's policy for peace and 
national reconciliation. 
  (?During the meeting), the KoC delegation proposed that the 
roundtable should focus on a three-plus-two formula as clearly 
stated by the King in his 21 November 1993 message. The KoC 
delegation believes that the implementation of the 
three-plus-two formula constituted a key solution and displayed 
the real goodwill of all participants in striving to achieve the 
King's policy for peace and national reconciliation. 
  The Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC]'s delegation 
reiterated its unconditional, immediate, total, lasting, and 
unchanging acceptance of an on-the-spot cease-fire throughout 
the country. 
  The Royal Government's delegation also voiced support for 
the 
King's wise proposal for an immediate cease-fire on the spot to 
begin at noon on 15 June 1994. 
  The RGC also voiced support for the King's initiative on the 
establishment of an inter-Cambodian monitoring commission to be 
made up of generals and high-ranking military officials from the 
KRAF and the Khmer Rouge group with three neutral generals 
representing the King as the chairman and vice chairmen of the 
commission. 
  Moreover, the Royal Government's delegation warmly welcomed 
the appointment of Samdech Chakrei Nhoek Chulong, General Um 
Manorin, and General Buor Hol respectively as the chairman and 
vice chairmen of the inter-Cambodian monitoring commission 
proposed by the King. 
  In this connection, the KoC had earlier mentioned its 
delegates to this commission. 
  The RGC delegation also proposed that simultaneously with 
the 
cease-fire, a [words indistinct] without delaying the cease-fire. 
  The RGC delegation voiced full support for the King's sacred 
and wise idea solemnly declaring Cambodia as a unified state 
without any division or secession within its territorial 
integrity internationally (?respected and) recognized between 
1963 and 1964 and as a state of peace, solidarity, national 
unity, and progress in the joint effort for national 
reconstruction. 
  But unfortunately, all of the King's ideas and initiatives 
concerning the above-mentioned unconditional, immediate, total, 
permanent, and on-the-spot cease-fire throughout Cambodia were 
vehemently rejected by Mr. Khieu Samphan, leader of the Khmer 
Rouge, despite an energetic appeal by the King and repeated 
pleas by the two supreme patriarchs, and Venerable Patriarchs 
Mongkol Tepeacha and Khousananda. 
  At first, Khieu Samphan proposed that the process of this 
cease- fire must (?be participated by some foreign countries). 
Five countries out of the 10 countries in the list that Khieu 
Samphan proposed for consideration had been elected before as 
cease-fire observers. 
  It should be noted that the proposed 10 countries are all 
full-fledged members of the United Nations which had bitter 
experiences of the Khmer Rouge in the implementation of the 
Paris agreement. 
  Secondly, the Khmer Rouge proposed that the RGC delegation 
accept a formula of so-called minimal political program before 
continuing the discussion on the cease-fire proposed by His 
Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king of the KoC. There is 
nothing in this minimal political program. But the Khmer Rouge 
did this in an attempt to dismantle the KoC's legal and 
legitimate institutions, namely the National Assembly and RGC 
born of the general elections arranged and supervised by the 
United Nations. 
  On 28 May, the participants agreed to issue a joint 
communique [words indistinct] roundtable for peace and national 
reconciliation was formed under the chairmanship of the King's 
representative Samdech Chakkrei Nhoek Chulong so as to [words 
indistinct]. This (?commission) will be made up of four 
delegates from the KoC side and four others from the Khmer 
Rouge. It will hold its first meeting on 15 June 1994 at Damnak 
Chan Hall in the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh. 
  From this roundtable meeting, it is irrefutable that the 
Khmer Rouge had displayed their intention not to seek a solution 
to the remaining Cambodian problems through political means. 
The Khmer Rouge had used the evil trick of attacking while 
negotiating. They had tried to internationalize the remaining 
internal problems of Cambodia [words indistinct] in order to 
dismantle the Cambodian National Assembly and RGC, which are 
internationally recognized through the free and fair general 
elections organized by the United Nations in May 1993. 
  This means that cease-fire which [words indistinct] vehement 
stubbornness of the Khmer Rouge.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Do the Communist Vietnamese </F>
Puppets and the Communist Vietnamese, Who Want To Swallow 
Cambodian Territory, Want Cambodians To Achieve National 
Reconciliation and Peace?"] 
  [Text] Before leaving for Pyongyang to attend the 
roundtable meeting, puppet Hun Sen said he did not want to 
negotiate with the Khmer Rouge, adding that he, however, would 
attend the meeting although he had little hope of success. 
  This remark proves that the communist Vietnamese, their 
puppets, and their allies have not changed their stand and 
continue to oppose the king's national reconciliation plan. 
Meanwhile, the stand of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] 
is clearly known to our nation and people, that is, the PDK 
upholds peace and national reconciliation and supports the 
king's national reconciliation plan. However, the Vietnamese 
puppets, following orders from their communist Vietnamese boss, 
have continued demanding that the PDK return liberated zones to 
them and assemble our Armed Forces for the communist Vietnamese 
and their allies to control and manage Cambodia at will. 
Frankly speaking, they want to smash the resistance movement 
for national liberation so that Vietnam can annex Cambodia into 
its Indochinese Federation. This is the same obsolete, 
unchanging strategy and goal pursued by the communist Vietnamese 
since time immemorial. In such a case, can one rely on the 
communist Vietnamese and their puppets to achieve national 
reconciliation and peace? Definitely not. 
  The communist Vietnamese want to eliminate the Cambodians to 
facilitate its plan to annex Cambodia. As for Vietnamese 
puppets Chea Sim, Hun Sen, Sar Kheng, and so forth, they have 
been installed by the Vietnamese for serving the Vietnamese war 
of aggression since (?1979). They are out-and-out lackeys who 
have been serving Vietnamese interests only, and have never 
thought of serving the interests of the Cambodian nation and 
people. Their nation is Vietnam, thus they want to eliminate 
Cambodia just as their Vietnamese bosses do. 
  The true nature of the Vietnamese and their puppets is well 
known to our nation and people. We have never expected them to 
deliver peace and national reconciliation to our Cambodia. 
Puppet Hun Sen's disgusting remark noted above is clear proof 
of this. 
  Lessons from the past, present, and even in the future in 
Cambodia and the world are clear proof that nobody can beg for 
peace and national independence from the aggressors. Peace, 
national independence, and the survival of each nation are 
always achieved through struggle waged by that nation and its 
people who are victims of the aggression. The same principle 
applies to Cambodia. If we want to achieve peace and national 
reconciliation, our entire nation and people both in the cities 
and countryside must jointly wage all forms of struggle until 
achieving genuine peace, national reconciliation, and national 
unity.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] In cooperation with the communist Vietnamese, the 
United States began its second war against the Cambodian nation 
and people right after the elections held in Cambodia by UNTAC 
[UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia]. The military campaigns 
launched last July and August to seize the Stoung and Phnum 
Chhat areas were financed by the United States. Meanwhile, 
France was charged with the air transportation of arms, 
ammunition, artilleries, and the wounded and UNTAC and Australia 
were in charge of radio communications. 
  The recent operations to seize Anlung Veng and Pailin in 
Battambang Province were also launched with financial aid and 
weapons from the United States, the allies, and the communist 
Vietnamese. 
  These military campaigns launched by the United States were 
just the covert, undeclared war. After suffering serious defeats 
on the Anlung Veng and Pailin battlefields, they started the 
open war in Cambodia. Over the past weeks, the Clinton 
administration hurriedly sent officials from the State and 
Defense Departments one after another to Phnom Penh to arrange 
the supply of weapons and ammunition to join with the communist 
Vietnamese in waging war in Cambodia. 
  Winston Lord, U.S. assistant secretary of state for East 
Asian and Pacific affairs, announced time and again that war had 
to be waged in Cambodia. A U.S. diplomat also said that the 
United States should think about waging war in Cambodia. This 
is tantamount to declaring a second U.S. war against the 
Cambodian nation and people. 
  In what situation is the United States declaring war in 
Cambodia? Which forces are being used as a springboard for 
waging this war in Cambodia? 
  I. The United States is declaring this war in a situation 
when all Cambodian people both inside and outside the country 
are jointly opposing the elements rekindling the Vietnamese war 
of aggression against Cambodia, and demanding national 
reconciliation so as to restore peace and security in Cambodia. 
This movement is surging thunderously. No force can stop it. 
  In such a situation, how can the United States rekindle the 
war in Cambodia? 
  II. In the 1970-75 war, the United States used the Lon Nol 
forces as the springboard for waging its aggressive war against 
Cambodia. 
  In comparison, the Lon Nol forces are better than the 
present 
U.S. puppets -- border bandits -- and Vietnamese puppets in 
Phnom Penh. The Lon Nol forces had enough to eat, quite proper 
clothing, and some political bases in Cambodia. 
  In this second war, the United States uses its puppets -- 
border bandits -- and communist Vietnamese puppets as the 
springboard. 
  A. It is no need to explain much about the border bandits 
because the Cambodian people know well that they are the 
lifelong slaves and henchmen of the United States and its allies. 
  B. As for the communist Vietnamese puppets: 
  1. They are elements installed at gunpoint by over 250,000 
aggressor troops of the communist Vietnamese. They have served 
the communist Vietnamese in killing countless Cambodians over 
the past 15 years. The Cambodian people know them as traitors 
to the nation and people and the out-and-out lackeys of the 
Vietnamese communists. The Cambodian people hate them and have 
jointly attacked them for the past 15 years. 
  2. The communist Vietnamese puppets are thoroughly corrupt. 
They have competed against one another in selling out 
everything, state land, buildings, tables, chairs, and so forth. 
In that case, what will happen to the money and supplies that 
the United States is giving them for waging war in Cambodia? 
  This shows that the springboard that the United States is 
using in waging war in Cambodia is rotten like [words 
indistinct]. Thus, the United States will never be able to 
fortify this springboard. 
  For this reason, in this second war, the United States will 
certainly face the same fate as it did on 17 April 1975. 
  The Cambodian people are shouting: United States, do not 
wage 
a second war in Cambodia!

<F P=106> [Station editorial: "Why Are the Communist Vietnamese </F>
Puppets Arrogantly Voicing Their Opposition to the King's 
National Reconciliation Plan?"] 
  [Text] One-eyed Hun Sen, Vietnam's favorite puppet, has 
just returned to Phnom Penh, where he told people left and right 
that the 27 May roundtable in Pyongyang had produced only a 0.01 
percent result, meaning that it was a total failure. This 
remark clearly shows that the communist Vietnamese, their 
puppets, and the alliance remain opposed to national 
reconciliation, their opposition to it having been ordered by 
their communist Vietnamese bosses. 
  The announcement of failure by the communist Vietnamese 
puppet above is a most arrogant and insolent declaration of 
opposition to the king's national reconciliation plan. Why did 
one-eyed Hun Sen dare to so arrogantly voice his opposition to 
the king's national reconciliation plan? It is because: 
  1. Hun Sen and the other communist Vietnamese puppets are 
out- and-out servants of the communists and rely totally on the 
4 million communist Vietnamese and Vietnamese nationals already 
inside Cambodia. 
  2. The communist Vietnamese have sent fresh troops from 
Vietnam into Cambodian battlefields, particularly the Route 
10-Battambang battlefield, which is a hot spot from where the 
troops of the communist Vietnamese puppets are being routed and 
fleeing by the dozen and by the hundred. 
  3. The Americans are sending their deputy assistant state 
and defense secretaries to Phnom Penh to prepare the ground for 
arms and ammunition shipments for the communist Vietnamese 
puppets to enable them to carry on their war against the 
Cambodian nation and people. 
  For these reasons, puppet Hun Sen did not hesitate to make 
repeated arrogant announcements against the king's national 
reconciliation plan. The puppets believe that, because they are 
getting arms and ammunition from the United States and receiving 
the support and assistance of Vietnamese troops, they can crush 
and suppress the Cambodian people's resistance movement. 
However, they are badly mistaken. From 1979 to 1990, that is, 
after more than 10 years of all-out war, the more than 250,000 
Vietnamese troops, with tanks, arms, and ammunition from the 
former Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact pouring freely into 
Cambodia, still failed to crush the national liberation forces 
of the Cambodian people. Vietnam's aggressive military strategy 
was instead completely and ignominiously defeated in 1989-90. 
As for the Americans, they too experienced the same fate. In 
1970 following the coup d'etat that deposed Prince Norodom 
Sihanouk, the Americans sent millions of tonnes of arms and 
ammunition to help the Lon Nol administration suppress the 
Cambodian people's resistance movement at that time. Ammunition 
was heaped like mountains in each of Lon Nol's army barracks. 
In addition, the United States used its modern aircraft such as 
the B-52's and F-105's to conduct bombing sorties around the 
clock against the resistance movement of the Cambodian nation 
and people. Nevertheless, they could not do anything to shake 
us. On the contrary, both the Americans and their puppets were 
completely and ignominiously defeated by the Cambodian nation 
and people. 
  The two historic examples just mentioned clearly show that 
arms and equipment are not the factors that determine the 
outcome of a war. It is the people, a sense of patriotism, and 
the national defense morale which constitute the factors 
determining military success. The winning party is the party 
that enjoys the support of the people. In Cambodia at present, 
the entire Cambodian people, both at home and abroad, have the 
common desire to put the earliest possible end to the 
devastating war in Cambodia. All of us want national 
reconciliation and peace. None of us want war and we oppose 
anyone who wants to continue it. We oppose corrupt practices 
and acts of selling out the nation, betraying the nation, 
killing the people, and setting illegal checkpoints to rob the 
people day and night. This movement is very powerful. It is 
raging like an erupting volcano. Therefore, even if the 
communist Vietnamese, the American alliance, and their puppets 
stubbornly insist on carrying on the war, they will never 
overcome the powerful aspiration of the Cambodian nation and 
people. They will surely be ignominiously defeated as in the 
past. 
  The road leading to extinguishing the flames of war is the 
best one for both the Cambodian people and the countries in the 
region and the world.

  [Text] In its third working day today, 28 May, the 
National Assembly held a plenary session at the Conference Hall 
to continue debate on the remainder of the draft labor code, 
from Chapter VI onward. The session directed by National 
Assembly Vice Chairman Phung Van Tuu. 
  The views expressed by National Assembly deputies focused on 
accepting workers returning from military service, on the 
question of female workers, and on several other issues. 
  Deputies Pham Van Tra of Haiphong and Truong Thi Khue of 
Quang Tri proposed that the labor code specify that all relevant 
firms accept workers returning from fulfilling military 
obligations to encourage youths to comply with the military 
service law. 
  Deputy Chu The Quynh of Hanoi said: Article 126 in Chapter 
XI, which deals with artistic workers, is not specific enough. 
We must clearly point out that we do not set the years of 
service needed for artistic workers to retire, but we will only 
fix the period of their social security contributions. 
  On behalf of the Vietnam Women's Union Central Committee, 
Deputy Vo Thi thang of Long An presented the views of the 
Women's Union on the question of female workers. She earnestly 
asked the National Assembly to pass the chapter on female 
workers in the labor code. 
  Deputy H' Nghia of Gia Lai proposed that the labor code have 
stipulations on providing vocational training for ethnic 
minority workers. 
  Deputy Dang Khoi of Nam Ha proposed that the labor code 
clearly stipulate that firms have the responsibility of making 
contributions to the unemployment allowance fund. This will 
provide prompt assistance for workers and help the government 
specify the amount of contributions to be made by each type of 
firm. 
  Deputy Phung Van Toan of Vinh Phu suggested that the tenth 
day of the third lunar month -- the death anniversary of our 
ancestral Hung kings -- be declared an official holiday so 
workers can get full pay on that day. 
  Deputy Hoang Duc Hy of Tuyen Quang proposed that the 
following clause be added to Article 174 on labor strikes: If a 
labor strike is regarded as illegal, both the organizer and the 
strikers concerned must compensate their relevant employers for 
losses, and so forth.

<F P=106> [National Assembly Issues Communique No. 4] </F>
  [Text] This morning, 30 May, National Assembly deputies 
held group discussion on various draft laws. In the afternoon 
the National Assembly held a plenary session to discuss the 
draft law on tax levied on the transfer of rights on land use 
under the direction of National Assembly Vice Chairman Nguyen Ha 
Phan. 
  The National Assembly heard Ly Tai Luan, member of the 
National Assembly session secretariat, report on the main ideas 
on this draft law which were condensed from a group discussion 
in the morning session. 
  A total of 19 National Assembly deputies expressed different 
views on the provisions of the draft law. They are Nguyen Trong 
Xuyen from Ninh Binh Province, Ban Tien Dung from Quang Ninh, 
Huynh Thi Nhan from Ho Chi Minh City, Nguyen Thi Man from 
Haiphong, Diep Kinh Dan from Soc Trang, Nguyen Thi No from Khanh 
Hoa, Bui Van Hoanh from Can Tho, Le Phu Hoi from An Giang, 
Nguyen Thanh Cao from Kon Tum, Nong Duc Manh from Lang Son, Bui 
Quang Ton from Ben Tre, Do Quoc Hung from Ba Ria-Vung Tau, Danh 
Ut from Kien Giang, Nguyen Khoa Kim Boi from Thua Thien-Hue, 
Tran Thi Kim Van from Song Be, Hoang Xuan Dung from Yen Bai, 
Dinh Hanh from Hanoi, Phung Quang Hung from Vinh Phu, and Nguyen 
Van Thuan from Binh Thuan. 
  All the deputies expressed an identity of views on the 
necessity to promulgate the law on tax levied on the transfer of 
rights on land use in the current situation. This law is aimed 
at enhancing the efficiency of state management over land, 
increasing state revenue, and meeting the aspiration of the 
masses. The deputies also contended that the draft law has been 
carefully revised on the basis of the views solicited from the 
people, echelons, and sectors nationwide. The National Assembly 
deputies also discussed issues related to those who have to pay 
tax in this regard, tax calculation, tax reduction and 
exemption, and the enforcement of this law. 
  Tomorrow, 31 May, the National Assembly will continue its 
work at the conference hall.

  [Text] Ho Chi Minh City authorities recently held a 
conference to review anticorruption work during the period 
November 1992 to April 1994. 
  Reports presented at the conference revealed that during the 
period, 604 corrupt cadres received disciplinary punishment 
including 72 cadres removed from their positions. A number of 
directorate-level cadres, who had been prosecuted before but 
still remained in the party, have been expelled from the party. 
  Law enforcement agencies are presently handling 321 
corruption cases. Eleven corrupt persons received life 
imprisonment terms. There are, however, still some serious cases 
that have not been finalized as expected. During its 13th 
session held October 1993, the city People's Council urged 
authorities to finalize quickly 58 backlog cases. Nine of them 
remain unsolved. Among six major cases that had been reported 
to the government, only four were completed. Many other 
important cases such as the Go Vap State Pharmacy, which 
involved the former director of the finance office, or the case 
of the (?Sakefin) Food Staples Company, still have not been 
brought to court though the prosecution process started over two 
years ago. 
  The rate of property recovered from corruption activities 
stays very low. In comparison with 151.7 billion dong, 
$857,737, and 824 taels of gold recorded as losses, the amounts 
recovered were 13.3 billion dong, $205,686, and 167 taels of 
gold.

  [Text] Vietnam's Archeological Institute has conducted 
excavations on a number of major islands belonging to Truong Sa 
[Spratly] Archipelago of Truong Sa District, Thanh Hoa Province, 
and found many artifacts testifying to Vietnam's sovereignty 
over the region. Following are some details of the new 
discoveries. 
  Archeologists found 350 pottery and porcelain pieces in the 
southeastern part of the archipelago. They are similar to the 
old potteries of Hop Lu and Cay Communes in Hai Hung Province, 
about 50 kilometers east of Hanoi. The potteries of these two 
communes were seen in the plain, in the midland, and also in 
coastal regions in northern Vietnam. Old potteries from Hop Lu 
also appeared in Truong Sa. This proved that in the 15th and 
16th centuries, Vietnamese fishermen and traders were using the 
Truong Sa Archipelago as a terminal to anchor their ships and as 
a stopover place on their way to the high seas for fishing and 
for dealing with foreign partners. 
  On Nam Yet Island, Vietnamese archeologists also excavated 
165 old pottery pieces at a depth from 44 to 52 centimeters and 
also [words indistinct] with heaps of shelves. These artifacts 
prove that Nam Yet Island was a dwelling place of people in the 
late Tran dynasty and early Le dynasty from the 15th to the 16th 
centuries. 
  Also on Truong Sa Island, the archeologists found old coins 
of the Minh Mang, Thieu Tri, and Tu Duc reigns of the Nguyen 
dynasty in the 19th century. Scientific research is being 
carried out by archeologists on the Truong Sa Archipelago. 
  The latest discoveries help the study on the social and 
material life of a part of Vietnamese people's history in the 
offshore region. They also serve as concrete evidence of 
Vietnam's sovereignty over the Truong Sa Archipelago through 
different periods of history. It is an undeniable fact.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA May 31 -- `Vietnam and the United States 
should build their normal relations and cooperation in a 
constructive spirit' said Deputy Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong 
in an interview to the army paper `QUAN DOI NHAN DAN' at the end 
of his ten-day visit to the U.S. 
  On the US businessmen's assessment of investment and 
business 
opportunities in Vietnam, Mr Luong noted that the US business 
circle recognized Vietnam as a big market with more than 72 
million customers in a favourable area in a region of fast, 
dynamically developing economics. Many American companies, he 
added, are now urging the US Government to fully normalize its 
relations with Vietnam and soon give the country the 'most 
favourable national' status so that they can have favourable 
conditions to do business in this prospective and potential 
market. 
  Asked about the fields of potential cooperation between the 
two countries, the deputy prime minister said that American 
companies were interested in all fields that Vietnam was calling 
for foreign investment. The two sides, he said, have the same 
interest in such important fields as oil and gas, post and 
telecommunications, electronics, informations, and so on. Apart 
from investment in industry, Mr. Luong went on, financial and 
banking activists of high prestige in the United States would 
soon come to Vietnam. 
  On the prospects of the relations between the two countries, 
Deputy Prime Minister Luong said strategically the two countries 
have realized the need to build normal relations leading to 
cooperative and friendly relations in a constructive spirit. 
This is a persistent principled standpoint, he stressed.

  [Text] The government has recently issued regulations on 
the setting up of representative offices overseas for Vietnamese 
businesses. According to the regulations, all Vietnamese 
business establishments which are legally registered and are 
capable of operating representative offices will be licensed. 
  Overseas representative offices should be put under the 
administrative authority of the state representative organ in 
the country concerned. The minister of trade has the authority 
to renew, withdraw, and cancel licenses for overseas 
representative offices. The minister of trade is also charged 
with the management and inspection of the overseas business 
representative offices. 
  The regulations on the overseas business representative 
offices also stipulate the necessary period of time for the 
Ministry of Trade to consider whether to approve or reject 
applications to set up representative offices. In cases where 
business establishments had representative offices open before 
these regulations, their owners should prepare new applications 
under the provisions of the new regulations.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 31, (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Prime 
Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamed Tuesday denied a Cable News Network 
(CNN) report that Malaysia intends to supply arms to the 
Bosnians in their struggle against Serb aggression in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. "If somebody is providing arms to Bosnia, we 
know nothing about this thing," he told reporters here when 
asked to comment on a CNN report Tuesday, claiming that 
Malaysia, Iran and Turkey will supply arms to the Bosnians. 
  Dr Mahathir said Malaysia was only providing arms to its 
1,500 soldiers serving under the United Nations Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The CNN report could have misinterpreted this as supplying 
arms to the Bosnians, he added. We are not in the gun running 
business, he said.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, May 28 (AFP) -- Khmer Rouge [KR] leader 
Khieu Samphan has raised the possibility of group members 
joining the Cambodian Government and armed forces in a speech to 
peace talks in Pyongyang. 
  In the speech dated Friday, and obtained here Saturday, 
Khieu 
Samphan said Cambodia should set up a framework "to be used as 
the basis for the formation of the national government and the 
unified national army which include all the Cambodian national 
parties." 
  The government has yet to give a statement on the progress 
of 
the talks which started Friday and are scheduled to last until 
Monday. Officials said no other information was available 
outside Pyongyang. 
  King Norodom Sihanouk is hosting the talks between 
co-premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, parliament 
chairman Chea Sim and Khieu Samphan at his residence near the 
North Korean capital. 
  The talks are based on a peace plan proposed by King 
Sihanouk 
six months ago that would give the Khmer Rouge government posts 
in return for ceasing guerrilla activities. They would have to 
open up their zones and merge their fighters with the Royal 
Cambodian Armed Forces. 
  The Khmer Rouge earlier expressed support for a ceasefire 
proposed by the king and the setting up of a joint ceasefire 
commission. But the group said final approval would be dependent 
on the participation of international observers. 
  Prince Ranariddh and Hun Sen have already agreed to a 
ceasefire if the two sides fail to reach a political solution at 
the talks and suggested June 15 as a starting date. 
  The rebels, however, accused the government Friday of 
undermining the peace process by seeking foreign military aid, 
citing the visit of a U.S. defence official as evidence that 
Washington wanted to arm Phnom Penh.

<F P=106> ["Statement of the Delegation of the National Assembly and </F>
Royal Government of Cambodia" following the conclusion of the 
roundtable with the Party of Democratic Kampuchea in Pyongyang; 
dated 28 May -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] I. Respecting the lofty idea of His Majesty 
Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king of the Kingdom of Cambodia [KoC], 
the two national institutions of the KoC, namely the National 
Assembly and Royal Government of Cambodia [RoC] sent a 
high-ranking delegation led by Samdech Chea Sim, chairman of the 
National Assembly; Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first 
prime minister and co-commander in chief of the Khmer Royal 
Armed Forces [KRAF]; and Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister 
and co-commander in chief of the KRAF, to attend, at the king's 
Chhanghsu-on Palace in Pyongyang, a round- table meeting with 
Khieu Samphan, head of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [DK] or 
Khmer Rouge, on 27 May. 
  II. The participation by the high-ranking KoC delegation, 
which is the legal and legitimate representative born from the 
will of the people and in line with the Constitution dated 25 
September 1993, constitutes a symbolic gesture and displays; 
  A. The respect for the idea of the king, father of the 
nation, who has always strived to seek peace for the Cambodian 
people with whom he has always sympathized. 
  B. The political will for peace of all KoC national 
institutions desiring to achieve peace and national 
reconciliation, without thinking of their superiority in power, 
so as to enable all national forces to jointly strive to develop 
the country for the well-being of the people in general, for the 
prestige of the KoC, and for ensuring national and territorial 
unity, sovereignty, national independence, and territorial 
integrity of the KoC. 
  III. Immediately after the meeting began, the high-ranking 
representatives of the KoC totally and unconditionally agreed 
with the lofty idea of His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, 
that is: 
  1. They voiced support for and firmly pledged to follow the 
policy of peace and national reconciliation of our revered king, 
to maintain national and territorial unity without territorial 
division and seceded zones, to preserve and defend the 
territorial integrity, sovereignty, and national independence 
(?recognized internationally). 
  2. The top representatives of the KoC, namely the National 
Assembly and royal government, fully accepted the king's 
proposal for a cease-fire on the spot to begin at noon on 15 
June with monitoring by an inter-Cambodian committee on this 
cease-fire. 
  IV. Unfortunately, the king's proposal of the cease-fire 
schedule, which has been accepted unconditionally by the KoC's 
national institutions, was rejected by Khieu Samphan despite an 
energetic appeal by the king and repeated pleas by the two 
supreme patriarchs and Venerable Patriarch Mongkoltepeacha and 
Venerable Patriarch Khousananda. 
  V. The king, venerable patriarchs, and the KoC national 
institutions time and again expressed their fervent desire to 
achieve national reconciliation and peace most longed for by the 
Cambodian people, but the Khmer Rouge representative only came 
to the roundtable, sitting before the face of the king and in 
the presence of monks from the two Buddhist sects, in order to 
continue his maneuvers to continue the war and shed the blood of 
fellow Cambodians by raising the same old argument, such as 
calling on the foreigners whom he has always opposed to arrange 
peace for Cambodia. This runs counter to the will of the people 
and the king, who correctly realize that the problem among the 
Cambodians can be resolved among the Cambodians themselves 
without need for help from foreigners.

  In the early afternoon, Tran Dinh Hoan, minister of labor, 
war invalids, and social welfare, and the head of the 
compilation committee for the code explained some points of the 
code that drew questions from deputies in the morning session. 
Most of the opinions were of high agreement on the necessity to 
introduce a labor code. They held that the draft code has been 
planned carefully and it received much input from voters, 
sectors, and echelons in the entire country. 
  The deputies discussed chapters one, two, three, and four on 
adjustment of the code, minimum working age, and some employment 
relations issues such as work duties, training, and labor 
contracts. On 28 May the assembly will continue its work in the 
conference hall.

  [Text] Malaysia's opposition to any moves to link trade 
with human rights issues does not mean that it condones any form 
of injustice. Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim 
said the opposition was made because it is not proper to link 
trade with human rights issues. Malaysia's stand has been 
consistent in that from the start it had maintained that there 
should be no connection between trade and human rights issues. 
He told newsmen this in Kuala Lumpur. 
  Datuk Sri Anwar, who is also finance minister, was 
commenting 
on the United States decision to renew the Most Favored Nation, 
MFN, status for China. President Bill Clinton, in announcing 
the decision, said the policy of linking the annual renewal of 
the MFN with improved human rights should no longer be 
practiced. Datuk Sri Anwar said Malaysia welcomes Clinton's 
decision because this is consistent with Malaysia's stand that 
trade should not be linked with human rights issues.

<F P=106> [Message from King Norodom Sihanouk to his subjects; date </F>
not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] My respects to both supreme patriarchs, to Samdech 
Preah Pouthiveang, Samdech Preah Khousananda, and Samdech Preah 
Mongkol Teppeacha [superior monks], and to the rest of the 
Buddhist clergy; my respects to all my beloved compatriots, old 
and young alike. I would like to inform you that the 
inter-Cambodian conference known as the roundtable in Pyongyang, 
the DPRK -- Cambodia's great friend -- has ended and has 
produced the following results: 
  1. His Excellency [H.E.] Samdech Chea Sim, H.E. Samdech Hun 
Sen, H.E. Khieu Samphan, His Royal Highness [HRH] Prince 
Krompreah Norodom Ranaridddh, and myself -- the five of us 
responsible for solving problems for Cambodia -- agreed to 
always be true and always be loyal to the principle that we will 
do our best to create conditions for securing peace and security 
for our Cambodian people, nation, and motherland. Our people 
have suffered for more than 20 years now. They are in urgent 
need of a cease-fire, of peace. Therefore, we must do our best 
to restore peace and fully realize national reconciliation. 
Furthermore, we will always be loyal to the sacred principle 
that the country must be free from partition or secession; it 
must not be divided into three, four, or more parts. We must 
preserve the territorial unity and territorial integrity of 
Cambodia forever. We must preserve the land and maritime 
borders of an independent, neutral, and nonaligned Cambodia 
which existed from 1963 to 1969 and which were solemnly 
recognized by the international community. 
  Therefore, we must defend these borders, this 1963-69 
territorial integrity and must do all we can so that all 
countries in the world respect these land and maritime borders. 
In order to do that we must achieve national unity, we must 
regard one another as members of the same family and avoid 
polarization. For this reason, the Pyongyang roundtable 
unanimously agreed that although Cambodia's overall problems, 
such as the problem of war, are not yet settled to a 
satisfactory extent, we must carry on the talks between the 
Royal Government of Cambodia and the party of Democratic 
Kampuchea. Consequently, the Pyongyang roundtable decided that 
in June 1994 another roundtable will be held at Damnak Chan in 
the Phnom Penh Royal Palace. This roundtable will be a meeting 
of representatives of H.E. Samdech Chea Sim, H.E. Samdech Hun 
Sen, H.E. Khieu Samphan, HRH Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, 
and Norodom Sihanouk. The five representatives will come to 
the Royal Palace on 15 June, continue the work left over from 
Pyongyang, and see to it that there will be progress in the 
search for a solution to all problems, such as the problem of 
war. 
  I would like to inform all of you, venerable monks and 
beloved compatriots, that I Norodom Sihanouk am affected with 
cancer of the bone marrow, an illness for which I did not 
receive any treatment during the two months that I was having 
the honor to serve my people, my country between our traditional 
new year and the day I left home in May. During this time that 
I was serving the people, the nation, and the motherland, I was 
very tired every day and I did not receive any thorough medical 
examination from my Chinese doctor to see whether the cancer had 
recurred. The Chinese doctor was worried that my overwork and 
lack of proper medical treatment -- as the one I received in 
Beijing -- would cause a relapse. The Cambodian and French 
doctors in Phnom Penh took three samples of my blood for 
examination. The results of my blood test were not good. It 
showed that I still had this cancer and a few other afflictions 
in my system. Therefore, I needed to return promptly to the 
Chinese hospital in Beijing. 
  However, because we also needed to hold the roundtable to 
bring peace for our people and end their sufferings, I made the 
ultimate sacrifice. As a result, my future was not bright and I 
might become very sick and might even die. Although I was 
experiencing a health problem, I agreed to make the sacrifice 
and I did not recoil from personal discomfort when I had to work 
relentlessly in the past few days. Why did I agree to all of 
that? It was so that our nation can live in peace [words 
indistinct] because of war. 
  It is most regrettable to me that the delegation of 
Democratic Kampuchea or Khmer Rouge headed by H.E. Khieu Samphan 
to the roundtable did not agree with the Royal Government and 
the National Assembly. 
  Our Royal Government represented by HRH Prince Krompreah 
Norodom Ranariddh and H.E. Samdech Hun Sen and our National 
Assembly represented by H.E. Samdech Chea Sim, as the chairman, 
fully accepted the king's proposal, that is, an immediate 
cease-fire or, failing that, a permanent cease-fire as of 15 
June when the war, the fighting must end without any conditions. 
They also agreed to study with the Khmer Rouge ways to include 
them into our Royal Government. They agreed to see whether our 
Royal Government can accept the Khmer Rouge leaders as 
ministers, deputy ministers, or secretaries of state. A number 
of Khmer Rouge leaders are thus to be included into the Royal 
Government and the Khmer Rouge army known as the National Army 
of Democratic Kampuchea is to be integrated into the Khmer Royal 
Armed Forces. 
  In this undertaking, I hoped that Pyongyang with its 
excellent atmosphere and calm would be a perfect venue for us to 
hold the discussion. I hoped that we would have sufficient time 
to solve the problem and stop the war. [remainder of speech 
unheard due to station going off the air]

  [Excerpt] Cambodia's elder statesman has emphasised that 
he opposes a proposal for military assistance to the Cambodian 
army. 
  "Samdech Son Sann does not support military assistance to 
the 
Cambodian Army as he has always believed that it serves only to 
prolong the war," his assistant, Son Chhai, said in a statement. 
  The statement came after Son Sann was reported to have 
expressed support for Thailand's position on Cambodia including 
the matter of military aid. 
  Thailand has repeatedly made clear that it is against 
military help for the Cambodian army. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report over video by correspondent Antonio Sampaio] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Manila conference on human rights in East 
Timor will really go ahead. A court in the Philippines banned 
the conference, but we have been informed that the organizers 
will disregard the decision. 
  The conference will start on Monday [30 May] with an address 
by Konis Santana, the East Timorese resistance leader. Our 
correspondent in Australia, Antonio Sampaio, managed to obtain 
an exclusive copy of the video that also contains pictures of 
resistance members: 
  [Sampaio] [Video shows armed members of the resistance in 
camouflage uniform, in the bush. Video shows the men in 
formation, sitting on the ground and performing tasks] These are 
the latest pictures to arrive from the mountains in East Timor, 
filmed at the end of April and given to us exclusively. They 
are destined for Manila, where at the end of weeks of Indonesian 
controversy and diplomatic blackmail, the first conference in 
the Asia-Pacific region on human rights in East Timor is about 
to start. 
  The highlight of the conference will be the opening speech 
by 
Konis Santana, the leader of the East Timorese resistance. In 
this speech, Konis addresses heavy criticism at Jakarta and at 
the cooperation that governments in the region are maintaining 
with the Indonesian regime: 
  [Begin Santana recording] [video shows Santana speaking, 
standing at a table with a gun next to him, and resistance flag 
draped behind him] Many around the world thought it impossible 
for a defenseless people to defeat such a great Asian power as 
Indonesia and assumed the East Timorese issue to be over. [end 
recording] 
  [Sampaio] [Video shows armed resistance men in formation] 
The 
resistance leader also appeals for further joint efforts in 
favor of East Timor and makes wide reference to the peace plan 
proposed by Jose Ramos Horta [resistance spokesman abroad]: 
  [Begin Santana recording] The East Timorese people are thus 
sufficiently ready to ensure civilized, orderly, and responsible 
behavior, within the context of the geo-political region. The 
East Timorese people recognize the interests of the region and 
Indonesia itself and will know how to respect those interests. 
The people of East Timor, aware of their position in the 
region, will fight actively to become a member of the 
Asia-Pacific region. Most of all, East Timor manifests its wish 
to put itself forward to become a member state of ASEAN, for 
only then will it be able to contribute to stability and peace 
in the region. [end recording] [passage omitted on 
correspondent reporting on Manila conference]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Participation of the North Sulawesi </F>
Business Delegation at the East ASEAN Economic Conference"] 
  [Text] The Indonesians reacted angrily to the plan by the 
University of the Philippines and several non-governmental 
organizations to hold a conference in Manila from 31 May to 1 
June to discuss the East Timor issue. Indonesia became more 
disappointed when, apart from being annoyed by the the plans for 
the conference, a business delegation from North Sulawesi 
Province had to cancel its attendance at the East ASEAN Business 
Conference (EABC) [preceding five words in English] scheduled 
for Davao City at end of this month. 
  According to Ir. [Engineer] J.W.T. Lengkey, chairman of the 
North Sulawesi Regional Chamber of Trade and Industry, the 
provincial trade delegation's decision not to attend the EABC is 
related to Indonesia's opposition to the conference on East 
Timor. Ir. Lengkey said the Davao conference organizing 
committee had been informed of the cancellation by a facsimile 
message on 16 May. 
  We are aware of the current efforts to boost East ASEAN 
cooperation, which involves Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, 
Malaysia, and the Philippines. For this purpose, we are paving 
the way for cooperation in the triangle growth project linking 
South Philippines, North Sulawesi, and Sabah. This is the first 
step toward the creation of the East Economic Growth Area 
(EAGA). Several months ago, Manado, the administrative seat of 
North Sulawesi Province, asked for the East ASEAN economic 
cooperation's permanent secretariat to be based there. 
  The process of promoting the East ASEAN economic cooperation 
is now one step backward as a consequence of the business 
delegation's decision not to attend the EABC conference in Davao 
City, even though trade relations between North Sulawesi and 
Davao remain normal. We fully understand why the trade 
delegation made such a decision, because this is intended to 
protect Indonesia's national interest and national pride. 
  On the other hand, we also have to be careful to not allow 
the political implications of the East Timor issue to slow our 
national development, which must be given priority for strategic 
reasons. The priority given to the economy is not inappropriate. 
Since the emergence of the New Order government, we no longer 
adopt the attitude that "politics commands everything" because 
such an attitude resulted in many development projects abandoned 
without being completed. In this connection, is it not too early 
for the North Sulawesi trade delegation members to cancel their 
attendance at the EAB conference? This is because East Timor, 
which is purely a political issue, has caused an economic 
implication. It is better for us to avoid falling into such a 
political trap. 
  We have to admit that East Timor is a sensitive matter in 
Indonesia and this sensitivity should not therefore be under 
estimated. Foreign Minister Ali Alatas has reminded the 
Philippines about Indonesia's feelings on this matter during a 
meeting with Raul Manglapus, special envoy from Philippine 
President Fidel Ramos, at the Foreign Affairs Department in 
Jakarta on 16 May. The meeting between Ali Alatas and Manglapus 
ended with mutual understanding. 
  We can fully understand that the Fidel Ramos government is 
faced with a dilemma about human rights, democracy, and the 
freedom of speech. Such issues are very sensitive in the 
Philippines since the Marcos government was overthrown. 
Therefore, it is rather difficult for the Philippine Government 
to prevent the Asia-Pacific Conference on East Timor from taking 
place in Manila. The Philippine Government has nothing to do 
with the conference and it is sponsored by a group of 
non-governmental organizations. Manglapus said that he was sent 
to Jakarta by Ramos to give assurances on the Philippines' 
solidarity with Indonesia, a close neighbor and friend in the 
framework of ASEAN. 
  Manglapus also gave assurances that his country's commitment 
and support for the integration of the East Timor territory with 
the Republic of Indonesia has not changed. Ali Alatas, however, 
has reiterated that Indonesia is very disappointed at the 
Philippine Government's inability to prevent non-governmental 
organizations from organizing the conference. This is because a 
conference that discusses political issues will provide a 
platform for East Timorese who remain opposed to the integration 
to launch a political campaign against Indonesia.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Military Intervention"] </F>
  [Text] We were surprised by the statement of the Armed 
Forces Chief of Staff for Social and Political Affairs, 
Lieutenant General R. Hartono, before a labor seminar on Tuesday 
that the military would again take part in coordinating the 
resolution of labor problems. The new policy came about just 
three months after the government revoked in January a 
ministerial decree allowing the Armed Forces to break up strikes. 
  Hartono cited the need to maintain stability, the weak 
organization of the All Indonesian Labor Union (SPSI) -- the 
only trade union recognized by the government -- and the lack of 
labor rules to accommodate the aspirations of all parties 
involved in labor issues as the main reasons for the 
reinvolvement of the military in labor problems. The Armed 
Forces apparently now sees labor unrest as one of the major 
threats to national stability. Hartono however, warned that the 
involvement should not be seen as military intervention into the 
labor movement. 
  The new policy seemed to have been prompted by the 
labor-related riots in North Sumatera which had turned into acts 
of vandalism against Indonesian Chinese during the last two 
weeks of last month. The incident once again shows how vital 
stability and security are not only for economic activities but 
for the further existence of our nationhood. 
  Highly-agitated workers, a high frequency of labor strikes 
and street demonstrations can easily be turned by irresponsible 
persons into riots and vandalism. These types of situations do 
not help solve our labor problems. Instead, such scenes will 
scare away investors. In fact, the labor riots in North 
Sumatera have caused some potential investors to reconsider 
their plans to invest in Indonesia as the incident showed how 
vulnerable our stability could be. 
  Businessmen, either domestic or foreign, will sink their 
capital in the country only when we can maintain a sense of 
stability and security. Without their investments, the economy 
will stagnate and no new jobs will be created for the estimated 
three million unemployed and 30 million under-employed as well 
as the 2.8 million new entrants to the market annually. 
  The question, though, is whether the high rush of labor 
strikes has really required direct military involvement. We 
fully agree that it is the fundamental task of the Armed Forces 
to prevent labor protests or strikes from degenerating into 
riots and acts of vandalism. But we wonder if that task should 
be executed by directly intervening into labor issues. 
  We think we should instead focus our attention on the roots 
of the labor unrest, that is the need for humane treatment of 
workers. The trigger of most labor strikes has been the failure 
by employers to adhere to the minimum wages, which are already 
among the lowest in the world. We should also realize that the 
greater prosperity the country has gained from its high economic 
growth over the past two decades has led to rising expectations 
among the people. The mood of our labor has also changed 
significantly in recent years as an increasing number of 
blue-collar workers are graduates or dropouts of secondary 
schools who are much more vocal and outspoken and more aware of 
their basic rights than those who have only primary schooling. 
Obviously, the authoritative management style which was 
effective in managing meek workers in the past is no longer 
suitable now. 
  We think labor protests or unrest can be prevented by the 
strong enforcement of the minimum wage levels and other manpower 
regulations to protect the workers' rights. The mechanism for 
company or plant-level labor management has been established in 
the requirement for companies to have a collective labor 
agreement. What is quite lacking though is the quality of the 
tripartite negotiations and consultations for such an agreement. 
  We have learned that in many companies such negotiations are 
in fact no more than a formality because the management has made 
up its mind before consulting with the workers' representatives. 
Given the weakness of the SPSI trade union and the weak 
bargaining position of the workers, it is the responsibility of 
the officials of the manpower ministry to help workers strike 
mutually beneficial labor agreement.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday said 
Japan, with its economic strength and technical expertise, could 
further help Indochinese countries and Burma move towards 
free-market economies. 
  "The idea of Former Prime Minister (Kiichi) Miyazawa to hold 
a forum for the comprehensive development of Indochina last 
year, the preparatory meeting last December, and the expected 
ministerial meeting in the near future, would facilitate these 
countries' reintegration into the mainstream of Southeast Asia's 
dynamic economic development," he said. 
  Thailand and Japan believe that economic prosperity is the 
key to enduring peace and stability in Southeast Asia, Prasong 
said in his opening speech at the international conference on 
Japanese International Responsibility and Contribution to Peace 
and Prosperity in the Asia Pacific. 
  Prasong said there was a concensus that prosperity required 
a 
certain amount of peace and stability and that the two 
conditions reinforced each other. 
  The two-day conference was organized by Thammasat 
University's Institute of East Asian Studies and sponsored by 
the Japan Foundation. 
  The seminar was attended by Thai academics, representatives 
of the embassies of Japan, China, and South Korea, and of 
international development agencies and Thailand's Department of 
Technical and Economic Cooperation. 
  The director of the university's East Asian Study Center, 
Professor Surachai Sirikrai, said this kind of seminar, though 
academic-oriented, could help explore ways to shape and 
reinforce Japan's role in the region.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan denies the 
Government is stepping backwards on the issue of news media 
freedom following censorship at two military stations. 
  Mr Banyat, who is responsible for the Government 
Broadcasting 
Directing Board [GBDB], said that since the Government came into 
office it had been giving "full freedom" to the news media as it 
promised. 
  This followed the events of May, 1992 when the public could 
not learn what was going on from state-controlled media, 
especially radio and television. 
  This week Independent News Net work (INN) radio, operating 
from Air Force station FM 102.5 MHz and Nation Radio operating 
on Army station FM 96 MHz were told by the Air Force and the 
Army that they would not be allowed to present news that did not 
have "solid evidence" because the stations felt they were being 
used as "political tools" to get at the Government. 
  Mr Banyat said that before the GBDB had all the power to 
control broadcasting stations but now that power had been 
distributed to the individual stations which had their own 
committees responsible for each station. [sentence as published] 
  He said that an overhaul of the radio and television 
broadcasting issue was being undertaken and last Thursday he had 
appointed a sub-committee to improve the law governing them in 
order to allow more flexibility. 
  More private radio stations, would depend on the 
sub-committee's findings, he said. 
  As for whether military stations could be turned over to the 
private sector, since they were founded for security reasons and 
there was no need for them now, Mr Banyat said military stations 
did give opportunities for news to be broadcast on a wide range 
of topics. 
  It was not possible for all to have the same opinion and 
sometimes problems occurred. 
  He said it was "difficult to say" if the action of the two 
Armed Forces was an infringement of news media freedom. 
  There was thought to invite the military to establish an 
understanding on the matter. 
  "This problem is not about the Government and the military 
or 
the programmers. It's really about the station and the 
programmers," Mr Banyat insisted.

  [Text] Small and medium-sized companies should not invest 
in Burma at the moment, but a large company unhampered by 
financial and other constraints could go in to enlarge its 
regional presence, say British Chamber of Commerce members who 
visited the country recently. 
  Deciding whether to invest in Burma "depends on who you are 
and what you want to do," said Ken Key, resident director of 
Chillington Tool Co Ltd. 
  The attitude of the delegation, as noted at a Chamber 
meeting 
yesterday, seems to have shifted from dismissing Burma as a 
basket case to looking on it as a venue for good long-term 
investment with the payoff depending on the political outcome. 
  "We would like to have our foot in the door," said Sandy 
Flockhart, country manager for Thailand of the Hong Kong and 
Shanghai Banking Corp, which has applied for a licence to set up 
a representative office there. 
  Opinion was almost unanimous that the "way to deal with 
oppressive regimes is not by head-on confrontation with them but 
by communication, probably through free trade," said Adrian 
Topham, managing director of Thai British Security Printing 
Limited. 
  Countries such as Singapore seem to have adopted this 
principle. Six Singaporean banks have gone into Burma, and 17 
hotel projects involving Singaporean investment are coming up. 
  Singapore is a large source of foreign direct investment in 
the country and is set to outpace Thailand which is now the 
largest investor in Burma. The figure for Chinese investment is 
small but business with that country is large, most of it going 
unrecorded. 
  "There is a market for basic products. Most of this is now 
available through the black market or obtained through barter 
trade," said Mr Key. 
  The military government has monopolies in timber and gems. 
It also controls telecommunications, mining and logging. 
  "However, it is possible to get into joint ventures with 
state entities or with Burmese citizens," said Mr Key. 
  Products have to be chosen with care. A problem arises in 
the case of manufacturing units that base their production on 
imported raw material. 
  "It is a Catch-22 situation -- there is a need for hard 
currency to import raw material but there has to be some export 
first to fund these purchases," explained Mr Key. 
  Investment in power-intensive industries is also best 
avoided. There are some attractive features -- the low entry 
cost and the low wage rate, unofficially US$8 per month. 
  But investors have to deal with a two-tier exchange rate: 
officially there are six kyat to the US dollar but the 
unofficial rate is 20 times that. 
  Until the dual-rate system is scrapped, Burma will not get 
assistance from the International Monetary Fund and the World 
Bank. The prevailing junta does not want to do this and lose 
face. 
  "Banking is basic," said Mr Flockhart. "In terms of trade, 
letters of credit are difficult to get, the smaller private 
banks cannot deal in foreign currency." 
  Lack of reliable data on the country also makes it difficult 
to make commercial decisions. The regime's figures often are 
exaggerated. 
  Peter Snell, managing director of Asia Market Intelligence, 
who derived his own statistics relating to Burma based on 
available information, put the growth rate at 1.2 percent and 
not the 5.9 percent the government claims. Inflation, 31.8 
percent in 1993, is expected to increase to 45 percent in 1994.

  [Text] The Stock Exchange of Thailand [SET] fell 26 points 
for the first time in 13 days after climbing steadily for more 
than 100 points, reflecting a mixture of profit-taking and 
growing nervousness about the political situation. 
  The SET index adjusted downward to 1356.87 on active volume 
of BtlO.39 billion. Declines were particularly conspicuous in 
the banking, finance and securities and construction materials 
sectors. 
  An analyst at Ekkachat Finance &amp; Securities Co 
indicated that 
the market fall could be attributed largely to technical reasons 
after the index had risen sharply for almost a fortnight on news 
of improved corporate earnings. 
  The analyst said investors are nervously watching the local 
political scene, fearing that a spill-over from the hunger 
strike of Chalat Worachat and the looming constitutional crisis 
might lead to an unforeseen situation. 
  Foreign investors, who have been a major factor in driving 
up 
equity prices, have apparently slowed their buying spree but 
elected to invest in blue-chip stocks, causing the stock market 
to lose its steam. 
  An analyst from GF &amp; Securities Co. said without 
fundamental 
support for the market, the finance and securities sector 
witnessed the highest volume at Bt2.3 billion out of the total 
turnover, followed by the construction materials sector at Bt2.2 
billion. 
  An analyst from Siam City Finance &amp; Securities Co. said 
that 
technically the SET index attempted to test the 1400 level on 
Monday but it could not breach the 1392 level yesterday forcing 
the investors to readjust their portfolios.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
returned to the trade negotiating table Wednesday [1 Jun] on a 
note of guarded optimism after a hiatus of three and a half 
months. 
  Negotiators picked up the talks on the insurance sector, 
which both sides have said is nearest to resolution, with the 
American side hinting at compromise. 
  "I gather there's an atmosphere of optimism that we are 
going 
to move forward," a U.S. official said of the insurance talks 
that are to run through Thursday in Tokyo. 
  "The U.S. is going to be more flexible but we're not going 
to 
throw everything overboard," said the official who asked not to 
be named. The American negotiators are sticking to their basic 
positions but be more open to Japanese suggestions, he said. 
  But Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii has indicated 
Tokyo has no new offers and both sides were cautious on the 
immediate prospects. 
  A Japanese official said Wednesday's talks would likely just 
reconfirm progress made before the bilateral trade "framework" 
talks ruptured in February over how to gauge progress in opening 
Japanese markets. 
  Another Japanese official said he did not expect to flesh 
out 
Tokyo's proposal to institute an insurance broker system, a key 
U.S. demand, as a major newspaper reported Wednesday. 
  The U.S. official said, "we'll just have to see how things 
go 
in this first round -- whether we move forward or just get 
stuck." 
  Asked if both sides could wrap up an agreement on insurance 
in two days, lead U.S. negotiator Ira Wolf, assistant trade 
representative for Japan and China, smiled and said, "we'll see." 
  The Japanese team is headed by Eisuke Sakakibara, deputy 
chief of the International Finance Bureau at the Finance 
Ministry. 
  The trade framework talks broke down Feb. 11, when then 
Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton could not 
agree on the "objective criteria" called for in the framework 
accord signed last July. 
  But both sides say the insurance sector -- unlike the other 
priority areas of government procurement and automobiles and car 
parts -- are less likely to revert to bickering over whether 
U.S. demands amount to "numerical targets." 
  Indeed, the U.S. is urging Japan to go slow in opening the 
foreign-dominated "third sector" of insurance that includes 
accident, nursing care and disease coverage. 
  A U.S. diplomat said in Tokyo recently that there are 
problems applying objective market access criteria to heavily 
regulated areas such as insurance. And a senior Japanese 
Finance Ministry official said the U.S. agrees such yardsticks 
are not appropriate for the sector. 
  The two countries are to resume the auto and parts talks 
Thursday in Washington and the talks on Japanese Government 
procurement of medical equipment and telecommunications Friday 
in Tokyo.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
on Wednesday [1 June] supported Japan's possession of a spy 
satellite in the future, saying the nation would deal positively 
with upgrading its information-gathering ability. 
  Hata told a session of the House of Representative Budget 
Committee that currently Japan has no plan to own a spy 
satellite. "But it is important to have correct (military) 
information to ensure our self-defense," the premier said. "We 
must study concrete issues." 
  Hata, asked about relations between a Diet resolution 
prohibiting military use of outer space and spy satellites, said 
the fact that the Defense Agency receives information from a 
U.S. spy satellite on a commercial basis does not contravene the 
resolution. "I understand that the Self-Defense Forces have 
been allowed to make use of satellites that are generally used," 
Hata said. 
  Atsushi Kanda, director general of the Defense Agency, told 
the same committee session that Japan should have the ability 
"to repulse ballistic missiles in the future." In that context, 
however, Kanda showed a cautious stance on the issue, saying, 
"there are various difficult problems such as the Diet 
resolution."

  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- China's trade minister on 
Wednesday [1 Jun] called for Japanese support of China's bid to 
become as early as possible a member of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  China's Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Minister Wu Yi 
made the call in a meeting with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa. 
  Kakizawa told Wu he hopes the tariffs negotiations between 
Japan and China now underway will progress smoothly, the 
officials said. 
  Following negotiations with China, Japan will submit a list 
of recommendations for China's tariff cuts to a GATT working 
committee to help Beijing join GATT at an early stage. 
  Wu told Kakizawa that China's economic and trade relations 
with Japan is in extremely good condition, with two-way trade 
reaching a record 39 billion dollars last year and investment 
between the two nations also increasing, they said. 
  Giving high marks to Japan's economic cooperation towards 
China and its three packages of yen loans through official 
development assistance (ODA), she also urged Japanese 
cooperation in the upcoming fourth package of yen loans. 
  Wu also called for boosting trade between the two nations on 
textile products, the officials said. 
  Kakizawa said Japan and China are currently discussing at a 
working-level the fourth package of yen loans to be implemented 
as early as possible. He also said Japan wants to promote 
exchanges of views on textile products trade, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Japan has confirmed that 
North Korea fired a missile into the Sea of Japan, Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said Wednesday [1 Jun]. 
  "I heard it (the launch of a missile) was true," the top 
government spokesman said at a news conference. 
  But Kumagai declined to comment further, saying the 
government has yet to know full details of the incident. 
  "It looks like it was not the test launch of a ballistic 
missile," he said. 
  The government also has no knowledge of exactly what time 
and 
where North Korea fired the missile, Kumagai said. 
  The Defense Agency characterized the latest missile launch 
as 
a routine test. 
  According to reports by U.S. television networks, North 
Korea 
fired a "Silkworm" antiship missile into the Sea of Japan 
Tuesday.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- The Defense Agency is trying 
to quickly verify reports that North Korea has laid sea mines 
off its coast, defense officials said Wednesday. "At the moment 
we cannot confirm the mine-laying," an official said. "But if 
the reports prove true, we might say this is a move indicating 
the North Korean side is hardening its stance in the direction 
of military confrontation," he said. 
  The information was received just after North Korea, under 
international scrutiny for its suspected nuclear weapons 
program, was reported to have test fired a "Silkworm" antiship 
missile into the Sea of Japan on Tuesday. 
  North Korean sea mines would also constitute "a big, direct 
safety threat" to maritime transport in the region, the 
officials said. 
  With mined coastal waters, North Korea hopes to ward off the 
landing of enemy troops, sources well-versed in defense issues 
said. 
  The move is apparently modeled after Iraq's mining of the 
Persian Gulf off Kuwait to counter the U.S.-led allied forces in 
the 1991 Gulf war, they said. 
  Should North Korea have actually mined its coastal waters, 
it 
could suggest that the Pyongyang leadership believes the nuclear 
standoff has been pushed to the brink and is ready to risk an 
attack from the United States and its allies, the sources said. 
  Floating sea mines, laid off North Korea's coasts during the 
1950-53 Korean war to cut off reinforcements and provisions for 
UN troops fighting on the South Korean side, have endangered sea 
traffic around Japan. More than 300 mines that came loose in 
rough seas have submerged in the past. "A similar situation 
might arise. And traffic in the Sea of Japan, for instance, is 
incomparably higher than in those (Korean war) times," the 
sources said. 
  They said the antimining capacity of the U.S. Navy stationed 
in the Asia-Pacific region comes close to "zero." Therefore, 
Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force, which has helped clear the 
Persian Gulf from Iraqi mines, could be forced to dispatch 
minesweepers if it came to the worst, they said. 
  The agency will have to closely watch North Korea's 
development and testing of ballistic missiles and mines issue, 
the sources suggested.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Japan's Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI) and the European 
Commission on Wednesday [1 June] announced a joint program to 
boost Japan's imports from European Union (EU) countries. 
  The plan is designed to maximize effects of trade promotion 
campaigns currently being undertaken by each party, a MITI 
official told a news conference. 
  Specifically, MITI and the Japan External Trade Organization 
(JETRO) will support the EU's "gateway to Japan" three-year 
export promotion scheme from 1994 by sponsoring trade fairs and 
seminars. 
  The Japanese side will also offer training to European 
corporate managers planning to launch businesses in Japan 
through acceptance of trainees and dispatch of Japanese experts 
to the EU, MITI said. 
  The program also calls for interchange of information to 
facilitate European exports to this country, MITI said. 
  These assistance programs are contained in a market-opening 
package released by the Japanese Government at the end of March, 
MITI said. 
  In order to smooth implementation of the set goals, MITI and 
the European Commission agreed to create a joint committee. 
  The committee will hold consultations twice a year in Tokyo 
and Brussels alternately, with the first meeting taking place 
here in September, MITI said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- The European Commission (EC) 
believes that further Japanese deregulations will boost Japan's 
economy and help expand imports, a high-ranking EC official said 
Wednesday [1 June]. 
  Simon Nuttal, EC director of relations with Far Eastern 
countries in external economic relations, made the comment at 
the conclusion of a two-day, high-level meeting here between the 
European Union (EU) and Japan. 
  The meeting resulted from an agreement made between Japanese 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and EC President Jacques Delors when 
they met in Brussels on May 6. 
  The meeting covered such fields as distribution, competition 
policy, sanitary and phytosanitary questions, financial 
services, professional services, public procurement and customs. 
  Nuttal said at a press conference that the meeting was a 
good 
opportunity for the EU to seek information about the 
deregulation plans of the Japanese Government, which is 
preparing a package of measures to be announced in late June. 
  In the meeting, the EU presented proposals for improving 
market access to Japan, facilitating imports and serving the 
interests of Japanese industry and consumers, he said. 
  Nuttal said, "We are convinced that this liberalization 
approach has a significant beneficial effect on the economy," 
noting that for years the EU has undertaken tasks of a 
deregulatory nature through "single market" exercises. 
  He said measures taken with a view to strengthening the 
domestic economy will also have a favorable impact on foreign 
exporters to Japan and help ease the difficulties created by 
Japan's trade surplus.

Friday [27 May] to expedite scientific cooperation in research 
and development of 69 projects that cover biotechnology, new 
material manufacturing and 13 other fields, Japanese officials 
said. 
  The agreement came at the second meeting in Tokyo of a 
Russo-Japanese committee which is designed to step up 
cooperation in science and technology, the officials said. 
  The panel was set up following the 1991 breakup of the 
Soviet 
Union in order to push joint research with Russian scientists 
who have excellent records of achievements in basic scientific 
research. 
  The projects include one aimed at developing techniques to 
forecast earthquakes based on satellite observations of the 
earth.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- The Justice Ministry and 
Japan's largest lawyers' group launched a panel Wednesday [1 
June] to study U.S. and European calls to allow foreign lawyers 
to represent foreign firms in Japan as an arbitrator in reaching 
out-of-court settlements of business disputes. 
  The panel, the study group on international arbitration 
representation, called its first meeting attended by 
representatives from the ministry and the Japan Federation of 
Bar Associations (JFBA), JFBA officials said. The panel is 
commissioned to come up with recommendations for legislative 
changes needed to authorize foreign lawyers to represent firms 
in Japan involved in business disputes and also citizens 
involved in international disputes on business contracts and 
products, they said. 
  The Code of Civil Procedures of Japan recognizes the legal 
validity of out-of-court settlements of business disputes just 
as the validity of court rulings are upheld. However, the 
code's article 801 says when certain firms are represented by an 
agent whose qualifications do not derive from Japanese law, 
related parties are empowered to demand the cancellation of an 
out-of-court settlement. 
  The United States and the European Union have been urging 
Japan to alleviate such curbs so that foreign lawyers can 
legally represent firms doing business with partners in Japan in 
seeking dispute settlements. 
  The ministry and the JFBA compiled and submitted to the Diet 
an amendment bill that would lift some restrictions on foreign 
lawyers who wish to practice law in Japan. The panel aims to 
produce specific legislative recommendations in response to an 
earlier ministry-JFBA joint report that called for "moving 
toward amending the system to expedite further liberalization" 
on the issue of international arbitration, ministry officials 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO--Leaders of Japan's largest 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) agreed in principle 
Tuesday [31 May] to consider rejecting the government's overdue 
fiscal 1994 budget in a carefully devised strategic move, party 
officials said. 
  The LDP, ousted from power last year after 38 years of rule, 
will demand the 73 trillion yen budget be revised in line with 
its calls for more realistic economic policies, including a 
greater burden on taxpayers to cover mounting welfare pension 
costs, the officials said. 
  If the government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata rejects the 
demands, the LDP will vote against the budget in an effort to 
lay the groundwork for a no-confidence vote in cooperation with 
the No. 2 opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP), they said. 
  But the LDP strategy is based on the assumption that the 
SDP, 
which in April quit the ruling coalition, leaving it a shaky 
minority government, will vote for the budget and clear the way 
for passage by the Diet. 
  The planned LDP objection is to show its clout in having its 
voice heard as the powerful opposition party, LDP sources said. 
  ``We have not decided to oppose the budget as a whole,'' a 
senior party official said. ``We will have our Policy Affairs 
Research Council discuss whether to submit demands for revisions 
of the budget.''

  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
said Wednesday [1 June] the government will map out a plan for 
administration reforms by the end of this month, government 
officials said. 
  Hata made the remarks at a meeting with members of the Tax 
Commission, an advisory body for the prime minister that has 
been examining ways of reforming Japan's taxation systems. 
  Kan Kato, the head of the commission, told Hata that in 
order 
to carry out tax reforms, administration reforms should come 
first so as to show efforts of reducing government expenses to 
the people, they said. 
  Hata replied that the government will draw up a plan for 
administration reforms by the end of June, before the Tax 
Commission is expected to compile a tax reform plan, according 
to the officials. They quoted Hata as saying, in administration 
reforms, that there will be no "sanctuary" areas. The officials 
said Hata also promised to consider drawing up a five-year plan 
for national and regional governments' administration, 
responding to a call by Kato for such a plan. 
  On the recently shelved plans for raising public charges, 
Hata told the Tax Commission members that he did not mean to 
simply postpone such hikes, according to the officials. 
Instead, he will instruct concerned government sectors to 
review public service systems and charges, Hata was quoted as 
saying.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- The leader of the Democratic 
Socialist Party (DSP) on Wednesday announced his resignation to 
take the blame for a political maneuver that resulted in leaving 
the ruling coalition with Japan's first minority government in 
39 years. 
  "I wish to step down as party chairman at the coming party 
convention to take responsibility for the fiasco stemming from 
the formation of a new parliamentary group," DSP Chairman Keigo 
Ouchi told an extraordinary session of the party's central 
executive committee. "Specifically, it means I will not run for 
the chairmanship at the next party convention" scheduled for 
next week, Ouchi said. 
  Ouchi, 64, has been under pressure to quit for his role in 
forming the "Kaishin" parliamentary group in April, a move that 
prompted the Social Democratic Party (SDP) to quit the coalition. 
  DSP Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa, 54, will take over 
the top party post, said Ouchi, who became chairman in April 
1990. Kansei Nakano, chairman of the DSP's policy board, is 
expected to succeed Yonezawa as party secretary general, party 
sources said. 
  At Wednesday's extraordinary meeting, Ouchi also spoke of 
the 
need for the party's unity and further prosperity as a 
full-scale political realignment is imminent. 
  Ouchi, who is health and welfare minister in the government, 
said he wants to concentrate on his duties in that post after he 
formally quits the party chairmanship. 
  The Kaishin group was formed by the DSP, Shinseito and other 
elements in the coalition, excluding the SDP, only hours after 
Tsutomu Hata was elected prime minister on April 25. 
  The SDP had voted for Hata, but walked out of the coalition 
because it views the formation of Kaishin as a move to freeze it 
out of policy-making. As a result, the Hata administration 
started as the first minority government since 1955. 
  Ouchi later told reporters he decided to step down as party 
head because he thought it is the best way to resolve the 
disarray over Kaishin and maintain the DSP's unity. But he said 
he still believes the formation of the new parliamentary group 
was right. "I'm convinced my proposal for creating a new 
parliamentary group will prove to be important in tackling a 
reconfiguration of political parties in the future," he said. 
  Ouchi said he decided to resign on May 13 during a plenary 
session of the House of Councillors and prepared a draft 
resignation address at the time. Asked exactly what triggered 
his decision to quit, Ouchi replied he thought it necessary to 
resolve the internal dispute over the formation of the Kaishin 
group and the SDP's subsequent withdrawal from the coalition. 
"When a row surfaces within the party, the leader should 
sacrifice himself," he said. 
  Ouchi said he delayed announcing his intention to resign in 
the belief that too early a revelation could make the matter 
even worse. Asked if he intends to serve as party chairman again 
in the future, Ouchi said, "I have no such plan." 
  Meanwhile, a senior SDP official said Ouchi's resignation 
will not directly lead to the SDP's return to the governing 
alliance. "Whoever is chairman, all we have to do is deal with 
the DSP," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Some other SDP sources, however, welcomed the resignation as a 
move that makes it easier for their party to rejoin the 
coalition. 
  On the other hand, a senior member of the Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) expressed hope the Ouchi's departure will aggravate 
the schism within the coalition. The LDP, toppled from 
government last summer for the first time in 38 years, has been 
threatening to file a no-confidence motion against the Hata 
cabinet, in a move to form a new government with the LDP as its 
core.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ] Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said Tuesday 
[31 May] the No. 2 opposition party is determined to investigate 
the suspected receipt by chief coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa 
of illegal donations from contractors. 
  Murayama, speaking at a press conference in Naha, southern 
Japan, hinted that the party would push the Diet to summon Ozawa 
to testify under oath concerning his alleged receipt of illegal 
donations from a contractor. 
  "It is the Diet's responsibility to clarify suspicions," 
Murayama said. 
  Diet Affairs Committee Chairman Sadatoshi Ozato of the 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the largest opposition party, 
also said the LDP will quiz Ozawa on suspected money problems if 
he is summoned before the Diet. 
  Ozato told a separate press conference that "as (Ozawa) is a 
key person in the ruling parties, it is better (for him) to 
clear himself of suspicion." 
  Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], 
a core party in the coalition, has denied allegations which 
surfaced last November that he had regularly received illegal 
donations from major contractor Kajima Corp. over the past few 
years, saying they were "properly handled." 
  Ozawa is regarded as the de facto leader of Shinseito, which 
is nominally headed by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  Murayama said the SDP will possibly submit a no-confidence 
motion against the government led by Hata, depending on the 
coalition government's response to demands for the summoning of 
Ozawa. 
  If such a no-confidence motion is passed, the SDP chairman 
said, the cabinet should dissolve the House of Representative 
and call an election. 
  Both the SDP and LDP have said they will cooperate with the 
minority coalition only until the Diet passes the fiscal 1994 
state budget, threatening that they may submit a no-confidence 
motion at any time thereafter.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- A top Japanese labor leader 
urged Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Tuesday [31 May] to take 
the initiative to get the second largest opposition Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ] back into the fold of 
his ruling coalition. 
  "It solely depends on Prime Minister Hata's decision," said 
Akira Yamagishi, head of the Japanese Confederation of Labor 
(Rengo), in referring to an SDP call for resignation of the Hata 
cabinet or general elections if the prime minister refuses to 
quit. 
  "There is no possibility of (the Hata government) resigning 
voluntarily en masse if the decision is left to Sinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] leader (Ichiro) Ozawa," Yamagishi said in a 
program on the private Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) 
television network. 
  Ozawa, chief strategist of the coalition, is regarded as the 
behind-the-scenes leader of the shaky minority government that 
toppled four decades of rule by the Liberal Democratic Party. 
  Rengo is a main backer of the SDP, which left the coalition 
in April after former coalition head Morihiro Hosokawa the party 
supported quit in a dispute over his shady personal financial 
deals.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- A preliminary meeting for 
forming a new political group was postponed indefinitely Tuesday 
[31 May] after a report suggested the new group might serve as a 
stage for a return to central politics by Hokkaido Gov. 
Takahiro Yokomichi, officials said. 
  The meeting, which had been expected to be held Wednesday, 
was to bring together members of a Social Democratic Party (SDP) 
policy study group called "Democrats" and of a parliamentary 
group consisting of new party Sakigage [Harbinger], the Group 
Seiun and Minshu no Kaze (Democratic Wind). 
  The idea of forming the new political group, aimed at 
seeking 
a new direction by uniting democratic forces, was revealed by 
Minshu no Kaze members on May 20. 
  However, plans were apparently derailed by a report in a 
leading Japanese daily that Yokomichi was to be involved. The 
MAINICHI SHIMBUN reported in its Monday evening edition that the 
new political group to be formed by some 60 lower house members 
in June had already asked Yokomichi to become a member. 
  The 53-year-old Yokomichi, who was elected four times to the 
House of Representatives with SDP backing beginning in 1969, is 
widely regarded as a likely leader of a new political group in 
the event of further political realignment. 
  Yokomichi told a press conference in Sapporo, Hokkaido, 
about 
a week ago that he would not seek reelection as governor of the 
northernmost main island next spring, promoting speculation that 
he might return to national politics. 
  One of four Minshu no Kaze members, Yuichi Takami, denied he 
had contacted Yokomichi on the issue, saying "we will wait until 
the public excitement over the affair dies down" before forming 
the group. 
  Political sources said the prospects that the group would 
offer a stage for Yokomichi might be based on the close 
relationship between the governor and another Minshu no Kaze 
member Satoshi Arai who once served as head of the governor's 
office in Hokkaido. 
  The four-member group Minshu no Kaze on Tuesday joined an 
existing 18-member parliamentary group comprising new party 
Sakigage and the Group Seiun. 
  Minshu no Kaze defected from the Japan New Party (JNP) 
headed 
by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa due to differences 
with the party leadership. 
  Sakigage, a 15-member party, is headed by Masayoshi 
Takemura, 
former chief cabinet secretary in the preceding coalition 
government. 
  The three-member Seiun, also a breakaway from the JNP, left 
after Hosokawa failed to carry out a planned merger with 
Sakigake.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- The suspect in Monday's [30 
May] abortive attack on former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
has confessed that he had no intention to kill Hosokawa when he 
fired a gunshot at a Tokyo hotel, police sources said Wednesday. 
  Rather, the sources said, Masakatsu Nozoe, 52, told police 
investigators that he simply tried to "threaten" the 56-year-old 
former premier who was at the Keio Plaza Hotel in Tokyo's 
Shinjuku ward to attend a party. 
  But an investigation has revealed that Nozoe, who was 
arrested immediately after he fired at the ceiling, had checked 
into the hotel under a false name about five hours before the 
incident, according to the police sources. 
  Nozoe had told police after his arrest that he fired a 
gunshot because of Hosokawa's remarks on Japan's wartime 
aggression and of Hosokawa's economic program. 
  On Tuesday, police searched the hotel and the Shinjuku 
office 
of the right-wing group "Shokonjuku," to which Nozoe had once 
belonged.

  [Text] Kumamoto, June 1 KYODO -- The Japan New Party (JNP) 
office in Kumamoto, western Japan, has received a threatening 
call following an abortive shooting attempt by a right-wing 
member against party leader Morihiro Hosokawa on Monday [30 
May], police said Wednesday. 
  Investigative sources quoted the caller as menacingly saying 
Tuesday morning that "unlike the rightist in Tokyo, we will not 
fire at a ceiling." The office has filed a charge against the 
anonymous caller with Kumamoto prefectural police, the sources 
said. Police are questioning the president of Seinen Aikokuto, 
a right-wing group in Kumamoto. 
  Hosokawa escaped uninjured after Masakatsu Nozoe, a former 
member of the right-wing organization Shokonjuku, fired a gun 
toward the ceiling from behind the former premier at Keio Plaza 
Hotel in Tokyo, where a party reception was being held. Nozoe, 
52, was arrested immediately after the incident. 
  The suspect said he had no intention of killing Hosokawa but 
wanted to "threaten" him for Hosokawa's remarks on Japan's 
wartime aggression and his economic program, police sources 
said. An investigation revealed that Nozoe had checked into the 
hotel under a false name about five hours before the incident, 
according to police sources.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Japan's foreign exchange 
reserves rose 2.34 billion dollars in May from April to hit a 
record for the third month in a row, the Finance Ministry said 
Wednesday [1 June]. 
  The rise to a month-end balance of 106.91 billion dollars 
indicates continued yen-selling intervention by the Bank of 
Japan to stem the Japanese currency's rise against the U.S. 
dollar. 
  The May rise was the seventh consecutive monthly increase, 
the ministry said. 
  Foreign reserves include convertible foreign currencies, 
gold 
and International Monetary Fund (IMF) special drawing rights. 
  A ministry official, as usual, declined comment on the 
reasons for the change in the foreign exchange reserve balance 
in releasing the figures. 
  Market players watch fluctuations for evidence of 
intervention by the central bank, which dealers said continued 
during May. 
  The official declined to cite any factors besides such 
interventions that would have affected the foreign reserve 
balance during the month. 
  The dollar started the month of Tokyo trading at 101.80 yen 
on May 2 and hit its monthly low that day at 101.48 yen, the 
official said. 
  The dollar was approaching its postwar record lows that day, 
which preceded three days of Japanese national holidays. During 
the holidays, the U.S. Federal Reserve led a concerted 
intervention with some 16 other central banks to prop up the 
dollar. 
  Dealers cited repeated dollar-buying by the Bank of Japan 
during the month in addition to the fed intervention, which was 
confirmed by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. 
  The ministry official said the dollar peaked for the month 
on 
May 16 at 105.15 yen, for a range of 3.67 yen for the month, and 
ended May trading at 104.38 yen Tuesday. 
  According to the most recent comparable figures available, 
Japan remained the world's largest holder of foreign reserves 
with a total at the end of March of 101.7 billion yen, he said. 
  Germany and Taiwan each had 84.8 billion dollars, but 
Taiwan's most recent figures are from January. No. 4 was the 
United States at 78.7 billion dollars, followed by Spain at 42.5 
billion dollars, the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii said Tuesday [31 May] his ministry is ready to issue 
additional revenue estimates on a planned tax reform if it is 
requested to do so. 
  His comments came amid mounting criticism of a report issued 
last Friday by the ministry which presents net revenue estimates 
for fiscal 2000 after ongoing 6.2 trillion yen tax cuts and an 
increase in the consumption tax to between 7 percent and 10 
percent in April 1997. 
  The consumption tax is currently levied at 3 percent. 
  The estimates were just mechanical calculations for the 
government's Tax Commission to promote "quantitative," instead 
of simply abstract, discussions, Fujii told a news conference 
after a morning cabinet meeting. 
  "If requested to offer additional estimates, we must 
consider 
doing so," he said, noting the report does not include any 
policy implications from the ministry. 
  Against this backdrop, Fujii said the report omitted all 
items that need policy decisions such as correction of unfair 
tax systems and administrative reform. 
  The report, submitted at the request to the Tax Commission 
and the ruling coalition parties, drew the criticism that it 
failed to include a tax hike to under 7 percent, a natural tax 
revenue increase, or possible effects of fiscal and 
administrative overhauls. 
  It also met criticism by setting conditions for redemption 
of 
stopgap bonds in 10 years and financing an expected increase in 
welfare spending entirely by way of the tax hike. The stopgap 
bonds are to fund the three-year time lag between tax cuts and 
the hike. 
  After reviewing the report Friday, the ruling coalition 
government asked the ministry for further estimates, including a 
consumption tax hike of between 4 percent and 6 percent, a 
"natural" revenue increase, and a 20-year maturity for the 
stopgap bonds, a ministry official said. 
  Some members of the advisory panel to the prime minister 
also 
urged the ministry at a meeting last Friday to brief them on 
estimates for a consumption tax hike to 6 percent, panel members 
said. 
  Referring to the delayed official signing of a merger by 
three second-tier regional banks, Fujii said that it stemmed 
from "clerical problems," adding there will no change in the 
merger planned for January, 1995. 
  Kita-Nippon Bank, Tokuyo City Bank, and Shokusan Bank said 
Monday they will postpone the signing slated for Tuesday because 
of a backlog in paper work. 
  But labor unions have voiced strong opposition to the move, 
posing a threat to the planned January merger. 
  This would be a big blow for the Finance Ministry, which is 
positively backing such a merger to revitalize the banking 
industry. 
  Fujii said, "we believe the merger will benefit the region's 
economy."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 28 KYODO -- Japan's top computer maker 
Fujitsu Ltd. said Saturday [28 May] it will launch Wednesday a 
new service for Internet, the world's largest computer on-line 
network. 
  The Tokyo-based company said it will establish access points 
in Tokyo and Osaka initially, which will be expanded to six 
other major cities such as Sapporo, Sendai, Nagoya and Fukuoka 
in July. 
  Internet is an on-line network for computers with common 
protocol and address architecture. It is linked to about 5,000 
government and academic networks in more than 140 countries 
around the world. 
  Customers will have access to a huge volume of information 
through electronic mail. 
  Fujitsu said it plans to further expand its Internet access 
service using its own value-added network to cover 52 cities 
across Japan in three years. 
  Company officials said universities and enterprises in local 
areas will be able to have access to internet by calling access 
points in major cities. 
  About 43,000 host computers with access to Internet were in 
operation in Japan as of October last year, according to 
industry sources. 
  Fujitsu said the initiation fee for subscribers using 
telephones or the integrated service digital network will be 
30,000 yen, plus 30 yen per minute for access to Internet. 
  For those with leased closed circuits, the initial cost will 
be 50,000 yen, plus monthly charges of ranging from 150,000 yen 
depending on transmission speeds.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- An advisory group to the 
minister of international trade and industry urged safe nuclear 
power stations that do no require much manpower to manage, in a 
midterm report it compiled Friday [27 May]. 
  The report noted that the number of nuclear power stations 
that have been operating a long time will increase in the 
future, but there will be fewer people to tend to the growing 
need for repair. 
  To cope with the problem, the report urged the use of 
computers for maintenance and periodic checks. It also said 
technology should be applied in a way that does not harm people 
or the environment when the power stations are dismantled or 
waste is diposed of. 
  Lightwater reactors to be built in the future should be 
designed so that they require little manpower, the report said. 
  In addition to aiming for environmentally friendly plants, 
the report pointed to the need to gain and understand the 
opinions of people residing near the plants.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Japan's unemployment rate in 
April stood at a seasonally adjusted 2.8 percent, down 0.1 
percentage point from March, the Management and Coordination 
Agency said Tuesday [31 May]. 
  An agency official, however, remained cautious in predicting 
whether the situation will show a clear pickup sign in the near 
future. 
  Since the collapse of the so-called "bubble" economy in the 
late 1980s, the employment situation has steadily deteriorated. 
  In a separate report, the Labor Ministry said the ratio of 
job offers to seekers in April was unchanged from March's 
seasonally adjusted 0.66. 
  That means there were only 66 jobs offered for every 100 job 
seekers in the month. The ratio, an indicator of labor demand, 
has hovered between 0.65 and 0.69 for the past eight months, a 
ministry official noted. 
  In April, job offers dropped a seasonally adjusted 0.6 
percent from the previous month, while the number of job seekers 
increased 0.5 percent. 
  Job offers increased 1.3 percent in the construction 
industry 
from a year earlier, but declined in other sectors. Job offers 
in the manufacturing sector showed a 21.6 percent fall as a 
whole. 
  The number of unemployed people totaled 1.94 million in 
April, up 23.6 percent from a year earlier but better than the 
2.08 million people reported in March. 
  By industry, the number of jobholders in the construction 
industry rose 3.2 percent from a year earlier, but those in 
manufacturing sectors fell 1.1 percent, marking the sixth 
straight month of declines since last November. 
  The Management and Coordination Agency, meanwhile, reported 
the economic slump pushed the numbers of unemployed new college 
graduates up to their highest level for the month -- 150,000 -- 
since the survey was begun in 1984. 
  Though the figure of 240,000 for March was the highest 
monthly figure recorded in the history of the survey, the agency 
said the April figures are a more reliable indicator since many 
graduates undergo a transition in March. 
  Comparing the April figures for each year, the agency said 
the number of unemployed college graduates had peaked at 130,000 
in 1986 before gradually declining to 60,000 in 1991. 
  It added that the number of students who were finishing 
school in March and were still without prospective jobs as of 
February, reached 1.06 million this year, 110,000 less than the 
number a year earlier. 
  Jobs for male graduates were down by 40,000, while those for 
female counterparts were cut by 60,000, the agency also said. 
Jobs for female graduates of four-year colleges or postgraduate 
education were particularly down this year, it added.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Bright signs have appeared 
on the horizon for Japan's jobs market, with fewer firms 
complaining that they are overstaffed, a Labor Ministry survey 
showed Monday [30 May]. 
  The survey, based on hearings at about 1,000 major firms in 
late April, found that about 40 percent, or 10 percent points 
less than in the previous poll in late January, still feel they 
are laden down with an excessive workforce. 
  About 50 percent, also 10 percent points less, said they 
were 
implementing some kind of labor-cutting program. 
  The results are in line with another finding in the survey 
that about 50 percent of those polled saw the business climate 
as bad, down about 10 percent points from the January poll. 
  Employers remain cautious, however, with only 10 percent of 
firms intending to increase recruitment for the next fiscal year. 
  Thirty percent of those surveyed are planning to skip or 
reduce the number of recruits, while another 30 percent plan to 
keep next spring's recruitment at this fiscal year's levels.

  [Text] According to a radio report from Seoul, traitor Kim 
Yong-sam held a security-related ministers meeting at Chongwadae 
[presidential office] on 30 May and made a bellicose, violent 
remark by saying that it is necessary to have a 24-hour 
operation of the early warning system, that it is necessary to 
strengthen the South Korea-U.S. joint alertness, and so on. The 
traitor also ordered a special alert and emergency alert for the 
whole army and the police from 31 May. 
  A few days ago, the traitor inspected on-the-spot the actual 
fighting combat readiness by the units of the puppet's army, 
navy, and air force in the front line area and instilled the war 
fever. The reason that he ordered a special alert and an 
emergency alert, convened a security-related ministers meeting, 
and decided to strengthen joint alertness by making violent 
remarks of war, hints that the military moves to put into 
practice the new Operation Plan 5027, which is a war provocation 
to invade the North, has emerged into an extremely dangerous 
stage. 
  This kind of military move clearly proves itself that the 
Kim 
Yong-sam ring is truly through and through a warmonger all the 
more running toward the adventurous road of war opposing the 
fellow countrymen by conspiring with the outside forces.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- The preparatory 
committee for the formation of the South side headquarters of 
the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification 
(Pomminnyon) published a statement on May 26 under the title "We 
Denounce in the Name of the 70 Million Fellow Countrymen Such 
Outrages as Confiscation, Search and Telephone Cutoff on the 
Office of the South Side Headquarters of Pomminnyon Committed by 
the United States and the Kim Yong-sam `Regime' To Foil the 
Second Meeting of the Joint Presidium of Pomminnyon". 
  The statement said the meeting was due to be held on May 26 
with the headquarters of the North, the South and overseas 
dispatching their views on the agenda to the joint secretariat 
in Tokyo, Japan, by using telephone and fax and the joint 
secretariat coordinating it. But the United States and the Kim 
Yong-sam regime sent ten odd policemen to the office of the 
South side headquarters of Pomminnyon on the morning of the day 
of the meeting to cut off the telephone, search and seize all 
documents, and illegally kept the telephone line cut off till 
13:00, It noted, and went on: 
  Such outrage could not be seen even under the preceding No 
Tae-u military regime. When the first meeting of the joint 
presidium of Pomminnyon was held in 1992, even the No Tae-u 
military regime dared not commit such outrage. 
  Thus, the violence this time fully revealed the 
anti-reunification nature of the Kim Yong-sam regime styling 
itself a "civilian government." 
  It does not make sense at all for the Kim Yong-sam regime to 
hold sway over the reunification question. 
  Moreover, the United States, a chief culprit in the division 
of the Korean peninsula and which is raking in profits from it, 
can neither bring nor want an independent and peaceful 
reunification of our country, and the Kim Yong-sam regime wholly 
dependent on the United States, as clearly seen in the "Uruguay 
Round negotiations" and in the countermove over the "nuclear 
issue" of the North, cannot bring an independent and peaceful 
reunification of the country. 
  If the Kim Yong-sam regime repent of its crimes in the past 
and take progressive steps for the independent and peaceful 
reunification of the country, though belatedly, it can be 
pardoned in the spirit of the great national unity, but if it 
continue committing anti-reunification, anti-national acts, we 
will fight against it together with the 70 million fellow 
countrymen.

<F P=106> ["S. Korean Workers' Struggle Cannot Be Checked" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 1 (KCNA) -- The South Korean workers 
will surely have their just demand met by more staunchly 
struggling to frustrate the crafty tricks of the Kim Yong-sam 
group and win democratic freedom and vital rights, stresses a 
NODONG SINMUN commentary today. 
  The analyst says: 
  Recently, trade unions of big businesses in South Korea 
including the Hyundai Heavy Industries and the Daewoo 
Shipbuilding on Koje Island declared that they would start a 
full-dressed struggle in June demanding wage hike, the 
reinstatement of expelled workers and the participation of trade 
unions in management. It is fully justifiable because it 
reflects their strong will and resolution to win vital rights 
and democracy without fail. 
  South Korean workers are now subjected to medieval toil for 
13-16 hours a day to be paid low wages far below the minimum 
living cost. 
  The analyst further says: 
  When he came to power, the traitor Kim Yong-sam committed 
himself to build "a society where people who sweat are well 
off." But he has driven them to the bottom of destitution by 
freezing their wages with the doctrine of "sharing sufferings." 
  The Kim Yong-sam group is urging the workers to obey the 
demand of the businesses, blaring that this year will be made 
"the first year without labour-capital dispute" and 
"labour-capital cooperation" is necessary to win the competition. 
  The massive struggle declared by the South Korean workers 
again, however, clearly indicates that any threat and crafty 
trick can never break their will to win their vital rights and 
democracy through struggle.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 31 (KCNA) -- The World Federation of 
Trade Unions and foreign public figures denounced the anti-DPRK 
campaign of the United States and its followers. 
  Jaroldo Rima, chief of the group of the communist members of 
the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil, in his speech at a session of 
the National Congress on May 17 said that the United States is 
scheming to take sanctions against the DPRK through the UN 
Security Council, clinging to military means under an 
unreasonable pretext. "This is an open attack on the socialist 
system of Korea," he added. "We denounce the U.S. imperialist 
policy and express solidarity with the government and people of 
the DPRK in their struggle to defend the sovereignty of the 
country and the dignity of the nation," he stated. He demanded 
that the government of Brazil maintain an independent and fair 
stand towards the situation prevailing in the Korean peninsula. 
  The World Federation of Trade Unions in a statement on May 
18 
hoped that the row over "nuclear suspicion" against the DPRK and 
the aggravation of tensions on the Korean peninsula by the 
United States and South Korean authorities would be terminated. 
"The workers and trade unions of the world would fight to this 
end," it declared. 
  Abdul Malik, secretary general of the Karachi branch of the 
Pakistan-Korea Friendship Association, said in his writing 
addressed to the U.S. President, the U.N. secretary-general, the 
general director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the 
puppet president of South Korea, political and public figures of 
Pakistan and diplomats of different countries in Pakistan on May 
22: "The nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is a matter to be 
resolved between Korea and the United States because it was 
caused by the United States." 
  He stressed that the United States should act with 
discretion, though belatedly.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- Foreigners expressed 
full support to the Korean people's cause of justice. 
  Jean Pierre Ngambi, general secretary of the Communist Party 
of Cameroon, upon handing over to the Korean ambassador to 
Cameroon on May 19 a signature paper after participating in a 
signature campaign for supporting the "10-point Programme of the 
Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the 
Country", said Korea should be reunified through a confederacy 
on the basis of the three principles of national reunification 
and the "10-point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole 
Nation for the Reunification of the Country" laid down by 
President Kim Il-song. 
  To this end, he said, the concrete wall, an obstacle to the 
reunification, must be dismantled and foreign interference and 
nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula be removed at an early 
date. 
  The Malaysian paper NANYANG SIANG PAU May 19 quoted the 
Malaysian foreign minister as saying recently that the best way 
of resolving North Korea's "nuclear issue" is negotiations 
through diplomatic channels. The newspaper described as stupid 
and extremely irresponsible the talk within the United States 
about "possibility and desirability of a war in Korea". 
  Amaral Matos, first executive secretary of the Mozambican 
Committee for Friendship With the People of the DPRK, in a 
statement May 23 said the DPRK has advanced most reasonable, 
realistic and fair reunification proposals on many occasions, 
but the South Korean authorities objected to the proposals 
categorically, and this shows that they have no intention for 
reunification. 
  He stressed that the way of accelerating Korea's 
reunification is for the whole nation to firmly unite under the 
banner of the "10- point Programme of the Great Unity of the 
Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country".

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- Solidarity campaigns 
supporting the Korean people and denouncing the U.S. policy of 
stifling the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have been 
widely conducted in the last two months in-more than 100 
countries on the five continents of the world. 
  Heads of state and government and party leaders of many 
countries expressed positive support to the just struggle of the 
Korean people against the anti-DPRK moves of the United States 
and its followers and contended that the nuclear issue of the 
Korean peninsula must be settled through negotiations and 
dialogues, not by means of pressure and sanctions. Among them 
were Pakistani President Sardar Farooq Ahmed Khan Legari, 
Congolese President Pascal Lissouba, Second Vice-president of 
the United Republic of Tanzania and Zanzibar President Salmin 
Amour, Senegalese Prime Minister Habib Thiam, Malian Prime 
Minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, General Secretary of the 
Communist Party of the Peoples of Spain Juan Ramos and General

Nepal including the chairman of the Nepal Workers and Peasants 
Party and the president of the C.C. [Central Committee], the 
Nepal Communist Party (United Marxism-Leninism).

organizations and masses, including the New Communist Party of 
Great Britain, the Britannic Communist Party and the British 
anti-imperialist youth organization staged an anti-U.S. 
demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy in London. 
  A mass rally was held in front of the U.S. Consulate in 
Chile 
under the sponsorship of the Communist Party of Chile (Action of 
Proletariat) and a statement was adopted there, and participants 
in a sit-down which took place in front of the U.S. and Japanese 
Consulates in Sankt-Peterburg, Russia, handed over to officials 
of the consulates a statement of the Leningrad committee of the 
All- union Bolshevik Communist Party. 
  The Central Executive Committee of the National Council of 
the Communist Party of India, the Communist Party of Bangladesh, 
the National Liberation Front Party of Jordan, the National 
Committee of the Workers' Party of Zaire, the Polish League of

encouragement to the Korean people's struggle.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 31 (KCNA) -- Publications of 
different countries hit out at the U.S. acts of aggravating the 
situation of the Korean peninsula. 
  The Zairean paper LA REFERENCE said the United States, 
styling itself the "only superpower" in the world after the 
collapse of the Soviet Union and East European socialist 
countries, is trying to bring all countries under its control, 
and that North Korea has become a target of such strongarm 
politics of the United States. 
  The Nigerian paper DAILY CHAMPION said the United States has 
broken down the third-round DPRK-U.S. talks and deployed Patriot 
missiles in South Korea, and this will only heighten the crisis. 
  A recent issue of the Nepalese paper NEPAL NEWS said the 
United States decided to resume the "Team Spirit" joint military 
exercises and deployed Patriot missiles recently under the 
pretext of the North's fictitious "nuclear issue". This shows 
that they have become an object of hatred by answering North 
Korea's peaceful efforts with confrontation, wrote the paper. 
  The may issue of the Nepalese magazine PURATIDHWANI said the 
United States invented Korea's "nuclear issue" and has 
aggravated the situation of the Korean peninsula on that pretext 
with the aim of destroying the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea, a genuine socialist country embodying the chuche idea. 
  The April issue of another Nepalese magazine MULYANGKAN said 
the United States' impudent demand for an opening of North 
Korea's military sites is, to all intents and purposes, a 
provocative move to force a new war.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- The release of an old 
man, An Hak-sop, and the repatriation of old men Kim In-so and 
Ham Se-hwan, unconverted long-term prisoners in South Korea, 
were urged strongly in different countries. 
  The secretary general of the Uganda-DPRK Friendship 
Association, the general secretary of the Ugandan Union of 
railway workers and the president of Chambogo Polytechnical 
College of Uganda in a letter sent in joint name to the 
International Red Cross on May 20, recalling that the South 
Korean authorities have kept An Hak-sop behind bars for 40 odd 
years and put him to all sorts of tortures for the mere reason 
that he refused to recant his belief in communism, called upon 
the organization to put strong pressure on the South Korean 
authorities to set him free. 
  Noting that the inhumanitarian act of not repatriating still 
now Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan who should have been returned to 
their hometowns under the Korean Armistice Agreement deserves a 
strong denunciation, the letter strongly demanded their 
repatriation to the northern half of Korea. 
  Chairman of the Human Rights Committee of Nepal Budacharya 
Sakiya in his letters to the World Human Rights Committee and 
the South Korean authorities said Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan 
should be repatriated at an earlier date so that they may enjoy 
a happy life with their families and relatives for the rest of 
their life. 
  The Nepalese intellectuals' forum for solidarity with the 
Korean people in its letters to the South Korean "president" and 
to the"president of the Red Cross" of South Korea on May 23 and 
24 said the South Korean authorities' refusal to send back the 
old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan contravenes the 1907 Hague 
Convention, the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the Korean Armistice 
Agreement. It urged their unconditional and immediate 
repatriation.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- The inaugural ceremony 
of the second-term South Korean Federation of General Student 
Councils (Hanchongnyon) was held at Chosun University in Kwangju 
Saturday, attended by more than 50,000 students from some 200 
universities and colleges throughout South Korea, a radio report 
from Seoul said. 
  At the ceremony, Hanchongnyon adopted a five-point programme 
-- opposition to outside forces, restoration of national 
sovereignty, democratisation of society, reunification through 
confederation and promotion of campus democracy. 
  The students vowed to launch a movement of opposing the 
United States and ousting the "government" for the establishment 
of an independent democratic government and the reunification of 
the country. 
  They also held ceremonies to inaugurate the National 
Reunification Committee and the Committee for the Promotion of 
Campus Autonomy. 
  Prior to this, the students in groups of 300-400 held 
meetings on education, culture, health service and the press and 
marched downtown Kwangju, divided into regional federations of 
General Student Councils and conducted propaganda shouting 
"Scrap the 'National Security Law'" and "Stop to Nuclear War 
Scheme on Korean Peninsula." 
  About 700 students of the agricultural college handed to the 
"American Cultural Center" in Kwangju 150 postcards declaring 
their "opposition to rice market opening." 
  More than 50,000 students under Hanchongnyon held a rally in 
Kwangju Sunday for a probe into the truth of the May 18 incident 
and held a demonstration demanding the punishment of the 
traitors Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u. 
  They condemned the sinister act of the United States in 
manipulating behind the scene the Kwangju massacre and strongly 
demanded the withdrawal of the U.S. Forces from South Korea.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- "Answers to questions 
raised by the general director of the Latin America News Agency 
"'PRENSA LATINA'", a work of the great leader President Kim 
Il-song, was carried by the Yugoslav paper BORBA. 
  Quoting the work, the paper said: 
  In the work President Kim Il-song of the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea said since the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula has emanated from the United States' hostile policy 
towards the DPRK, it must be resolved through dialogues between 
the DPRK and the United States. 
  Noting that pressure can never be a solution to the problem, 
he said it is a miscalculation to think that they can bring the 
Korean people to their knees by means of pressure and force, the 
people who regard independence as their lifeblood. If the 
United States continues to clamour for putting pressure on the 
DPRK, the DPRK will be compelled to take due measures of 
self-defence to safeguard the dignity of the Korean nation and 
the sovereignty of the country, he stressed. 
  This work was also reported by the Yugoslav Tanjug News 
Agency and Belgrade radio and television, the Mozambican paper 
NOTICIAS, the Tanzanian paper DAILY NEWS, the Malaysian paper 
SIN CHEW JIT POH, the Thai paper SIN CHONG YUAN PAO, the 
Tunisian papers LA PRESSE and LE RENOUVEAU, the Pakistani papers 
MUSLIM, PAKISTAN OBSERVER, HABARE and MARGAJ, the Kazakh paper 
EXPRESS, the Indonesian Antara News Agency, a Malian radio and 
Madagascan radio and television. 
  His work "Answers to Questions Raised by a Delegation of 
Journalists of WASHINGTON TIMES from the United States" was 
carried by the Russian paper MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA, the Yemeni 
paper AL THAORAH and the U.S. paper INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE.

  [Text] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has received a 
reply from Yasir 'Arafat, president of Palestinian State and 
chairman of Palestinian Liberation Organization Executive 
Committee on his solidarity message to the latter. 
  The message reads: 
  Pyongyang, 
  Your Excellency DPRK President Kim Il-song: I extend my 
greetings to you, Your Excellency President Kim Il-song. On 
behalf of the Palestinian people, members of Executive Committee 
of Palestinian Liberation Organization, and my own name, I 
extend my deep appreciation to you, Your Excellency, and to your 
government and to your friendly people through you, for your 
solidarity message supporting the Palestinian people's struggle. 
  In the message you have expressed a firm feeling of 
solidarity again. This proves how friendly and cooperative 
relations and solidarity between the people of our two countries 
are close and strong. We hope that we will be able to further 
deepen and develop the relations to comply with the common 
interests of the two countries' people, who want to secure peace 
and stability and to make progress and prosperity in our area, 
as well as in your area, thus making effort for its realization. 
  Since the signing of an agreement on the Palestinian 
autonomy 
in Gaza and Jericho areas, our Palestinian people have begun the 
work of laying foundations and building facilities urgently 
needed to establish the national government. With great trust 
and hope, our people, who have entered such an important stage, 
expect that all of our friends, as well as all people throughout 
the world, who love freedom, justice, and peace, are able to 
express their support and greetings needed to consolidate the 
basis of the Palestinian government. 
  Strengthening the basis of the Palestinian government 
guarantees security, peace, stability, progress, and prosperity 
of the people of all countries in our area. Also, this will be 
the first important step in maintaining the fair and durable 
peace in the Middle East region, enabling our Palestinian people 
to terminate Israel's occupation of their territory and to 
restore and exercise their legal national rights, including the 
rights to establish a independent state with the sacred area 
[kudosul] as its capital. 
  Finally, I extend my deep thanks to you, Your Excellency, 
once again, and wish you a long life and good health. I wish 
you success in your people's work for national reunification, 
progress, and prosperity. I extend my best regards and warmest 
greetings to you as well, Your Excellency. [signed] Yasir 
'Arafat, president of Palestinian State and chairman of 
Palestinian Liberation Organization Executive Committee.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 1 (KCNA) -- The cooperative farms 
across the country had finished maize sowing in all fields by 
May 31 except northern cold areas and some seedling beds. 
  Maize is a high-yielding crop which holds a big share 
together with rice in the nation's grain production. 
  The agricultural working people had made substantial 
preparations for farming from the beginning of the year. They 
selected high-yielding strains on the principle of right crop in 
right area and sowed maize in seedling beds on a stage-by-stage 
basis and transplanted seedlings in time. 
  Cooperative farmers in North and South Hwanghae Provinces, 
North and South Pyongan Provinces and other areas are manuring 
and tending the maize plants with good care.

<F P=106> ["Guideline in Switching Cooperative Ownership Over To </F>
All-people Ownership" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- The concrete tasks and 
ways of switching cooperative ownership over to all-people 
ownership advanced by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in 
his famous work "For the Ultimate Solution of the Rural Question 
Under the Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses" constitute a 
militant banner for the ultimate solution of the rural question 
and the complete victory of socialism in Korea. 
  This is stressed by Dr. Kim Chol in an article contributed 
to 
NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The article says the great leader in the work 
comprehensively 
expounded theoretical and practical questions in successfully 
switching cooperative ownership over to all-people ownership. 
  The respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song is quoted as 
saying: 
  "Cooperative ownership should be switched over to all-people 
ownership with success by consolidating and developing the 
agricultural cooperative economy." 
  The great leader said the switchover must be carried out 
gradually, depending on the maturity of all the conditions and 
possibilities. 
  The fundamental prerequisite for the switchover is to raise 
the level of ideological consciousness of the cooperative 
farmers and consolidate the material and technical foundations 
of the cooperative economy. 
  What is important here is to educate the cooperative farmers 
ideologically and train them into revolutionaries and assimilate 
them to the working class. 
  We can say the important conditions for the switchover are 
matured only when the level of ideological consciousness of the 
farmers is raised and they give full play to high patriotic 
enthusiasm and devotion in socialist rural construction, deeply 
conscious that the interests of society and collective include 
their private interests and the prosperity and development of 
the socialist motherland and the socialist countryside are 
essential for their worthy life and happiness. 
  We can say the solid material and technical foundations for 
the switchover are laid only when the distinctions between 
industrial and agricultural labour are gradually eliminated and 
the efficiency of agricultural labour is decisively enhanced 
through the industrialisation and modernisation of agriculture 
and the improvement of the farming methods and the cultivation 
system. 
  By indicating in the work the fundamental prerequisite for 
the switchover, the great leader provided a guideline for 
successfully solving this matter without the slightest deviation 
and turns and twists. 
  The work says the switchover of cooperative ownership to 
all-people ownership must be done with the county as a unit. 
The county is the base linking the towns with the countryside 
in all spheres of politics, the economy and culture and serves 
as the basic unit for the direct guidance and management of the 
rural economy. 
  Since a well-organised agricultural guidance and management 
system has been established with the county as a unit in our 
country, the most reasonable form and method is to convert 
cooperative farms in the county into state farms under 
all-people ownership and let the county undertake their unified 
guidance and management.

<F P=106> ["WPK's Idea and Policy, Great Banner of Victory in </F>
Revolution"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 1 (KCNA) -- The idea and policy of 
the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] are the most correct guiding 
principle in victoriously advancing and accomplishing the cause 
of socialism in the present era and a powerful weapon that our 
party members and working people should always hold tightly, 
stresses NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The paper says in a by-lined article: 
  The idea and policy of the WPK are the most popular line and 
policy suited to the requirement and desire of our people and 
the most scientific blueprint conforming to the specific 
conditions of our country and the realistic demand of socialist 
construction. 
  There can be no leader, apart from the people. The leader 
acquires wisdom, leadership ability and virtues among them. 
This is the unshakable creed of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il. The dear leader who regards the people as his teacher 
always finds himself among the people, learns what they wish and 
want and works out new line and policy, reflecting it. 
  In the whole course of leading the revolution and 
construction, the dear leader correctly saw through the specific 
conditions of our country and the requirement of our developing 
revolution in time with his rare wisdom and scientific 
penetration and gave profound answers to the puestions whose 
solution the time and the revolution and the reality awaited 
eagerly. 
  The idea and policy of our party also give profound answers 
to the questions whose solution not only the Korean revolution 
but also the cause of global independence eagerly await. 
  The revolutionary ideas and theories on the party building 
of 
the working class and the accomplishment of the cause of 
socialism contained in the famous works "The Historical Lesson 
in Building Socialism and the General Line of Our Party," "On 
the Fundamentals of Revolutionary Party Building" and "Abuses of 
Socialism are Intolerable" were expounded by the dear leader 
with a deep insight into the actual demand of the developing 
revolution of the world for clearly expounding to the people the 
essence and lesson of the situation and the road ahead of the 
socialist reconstruction movement. 
  The validity and vitality of the idea and policy of the WPK 
have been fully proved through revolutionary practice.

  [Text] Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army [KPA] 
Comrade Kim Chong-il has sent thanks to Yi Ki-pom and Hwang 
Tong-kyu, political functionaries of the unit of the Korean 
People's Security Forces to which Comrade Kim Tae-song belongs, 
and four discharged soldiers who collectively advanced into the 
socialist rural area. 
  Yi Ki-pom, political functionary, visited Choe Hyong-nak, an 
officer who displayed an exemplary deed in carrying out his 
combat duty, every day when the latter was seriously injured 
from an unexpected accident and was receiving medical treatment 
in a hospital. Yi Ki-pom brought food and encouraged Choe 
Hyong-nak to receive medical treatment. When Choe Hyong-nak was 
evacuated to a hospital distant from his unit, Yi Ki-pom often 
visited and comforted him. 
  Yi Ki-pom later visited Choe Hyong-nak who was residing in 
his home town, Samhwa-ri, Munchon, as a disabled veteran, and 
encouraged him, urging him to remain loyal to the party and the 
leader like a soldier although the guardpost was changed. At 
Choe Hyong-nak's wedding, Yi Ki-pom visited him with the 
commanding officer of the unit and congratulated him. On many 
occasions, he helped build Choe Hyong-nak's home, along with 
other soldiers of the unit. Together with him, Yi Ki-pom went 
to the Samhwa cooperative farm to encourage enthusiasm among the 
workers. 
  Officers Yi Nam-son, Yi Pyong-man, Choe Su-hwan, and Pak 
Myong-son, who visited Choe Hyong-nak with Yi Ki-pom, 
collectively advanced into Samhwa cooperative farm where the 
comrade-in-arms was living when they were discharged last 
December, not returning home, thus blooming the great leader's 
grand rural area-building plan. 
  Political functionary Hwang Tong-kyu, deeply impressed by 
the 
comradeship of the soldiers of the unit, including Yi Ki-pom, 
made his sister, who was working at a fabric plant, marry a 
disabled veteran, and made his sister Hwang Kum-suk, who was 
working at a cooperative farm, marry Choe Hyong-nak in August 
last year. 
  The meetings to deliver the thanks of the KPA Supreme 
Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il were held on the spot. At the 
meetings, the comrade supreme commander's thanks were delivered 
amid enthusiastic applause of the participants. This was 
followed by a debate of resolutions. The meetings adopted 
letters of pledge to the dear leader of our party and our people 
KPA Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il.

<F P=106> ["Noble Ideological and Moral Traits of Soldiers of Great </F>
General"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- A by-lined article of 
NODONG SINMUN today tells about the noble ideological and moral 
traits of soldiers of the great general Kim Chong-il, saying no 
titles are so honourable and precious for the Korean people than 
the title of revolutionary soldiers of the general. 
  The article says: 
  The soldiers of the great general Kim Chong-il are steadfast 
revolutionary fighters safeguarding the party and the leader 
with their lives and pure revolutionaries who think and act in 
accordance with the ideas and intentions of the party and the 
leader. 
  They are also indomitable fighters who consistently share 
life and death, sweets and bitters with the party and the 
leader in any circumstances. 
  Referring to the noblest ideological and moral traits of 
general Kim Chong-il's soldiers, the article says: 
  Characteristic of the ideological and moral traits of our 
revolutionary soldiers is, above all, that they have the 
unshakable revolutionary conviction and will to believe in and 
follow only the great general Kim Chong-il. 
  Their belief in the great general Kim Chong-il is the part 
and parcel of our revolutionary soldiers' ideological and moral 
traits. 
  Ours is the inexorable belief that as long as we are guided 
by general Kim Chong-il we are sure to win. Ours is the 
unshakable determination to fight on, entirely entrusting our 
whole destinies to the party and the leader. Ours is the 
revolutionary principle which will never change in any adversity. 
  This conviction is the most solid and noblest ideological 
sentiments which we have consolidated on the basis of our deep 
understanding of the greatness of general Kim Chong-il through 
our life experience. 
  Another characteristic of the ideological and moral traits 
of 
our revolutionary soldiers is that they cherish revolutionary 
fidelity to the great general Kim Chong-il. 
  The soldiers of the great general Kim Chong-il have a warmer 
sense of obligations than others to repay the benevolence of the 
party and the leader. 
  Their fidelity is a sincere and pure one emanating from the 
minds of the soldiers who always deeply cherish the love and 
benevolence of the illustrious leader. It is a noble spirit of 
devoting their all to repay even a little the benevolence of the 
party. 
  Characteristic of the ideological and moral traits of our 
revolutionary soldiers is also that they have a revolutionary 
view of life that they can lead a worthy life only when they 
fight under the guidance of the great general Kim Chong-il. 
  Our view of life is the steadfast revolutionary creed that 
they should feel honored to live or die on the road of 
revolution following the illustrious leader, and the 
life-giving water exalting human dignity and life forever. 
Living in luxury or riches cannot be a happiness for them and a 
life, however long it may be, cannot be called an eternal life. 
Their happiness and eternal life lie in living a worthy life 
under the loving care of the party even if they lived a day. 
  Now, our country has a great army of loyal revolutionary 
soldiers who share views and the same destiny with the great 
general Kim Chong-il. The entire Korean people are all 
revolutionary soldiers of general Kim Chong-il.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Life of Great Happiness Upholding the </F>
Great Leader [widaehan yongdoja] at the Head of the Party"] 
  [Text] Our party members and working people are 
vigorously accelerating the revolution and construction, 
upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the father of 
the people [inminui oboi] and helping and encouraging each 
other, like real brothers and sisters. It is the foremost glory 
and pride for our people to fully enjoy the happiness in which 
they find nothing to envy in the world while upholding the great 
father as one large family. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: I am very 
glad that Comrade Kim Chong-il commands people's respect, love, 
and admiration as a leader who inherits the cause of the 
revolution. 
  There is no happiness for the people greater than living and 
carrying out the revolution upholding the great leader [widaehan 
yongdoja] as their father. Our people boundlessly trust and 
follow the dear comrade leader as father now. Here lies our 
people's noble feeling of ideological resolve to 
enthusiastically adore and follow to the end of the world the 
great leader who takes total responsibility for all their 
destiny and future and tenderly cares for and leads them. 
  Traversing the long and glorious road of the revolution 
under 
the leadership of the dear comrade leader, our people have 
learned deep in their hearts the leader's greatness, his love 
for the people, and his noble communist virtue. For our people, 
the dear comrade leader is a great teacher and benevolent father 
who takes total responsibility for their destiny and blooms it. 
  The dear comrade leader not only commended our people as 
masters of the revolution and good teachers [as heard], but 
granted them the noblest political life and continuously gives 
them familial love to be acclaimed generation after generation. 
It is the firm conviction of the dear comrade leader that 
without the people, the leader, the revolution, the party, and 
sovereignty would lose the significance of their existence. 
  Thanks to the fatherly love of the dear comrade leader, all 
the working people in our country not only participate in 
political life freely today but carry out their duty for society 
and group honorably. In the loving bosom of the dear comrade 
leader, mistreated workers, peasants, and intellectuals and 
their sons and daughters have been brought up today to be cadres 
of the party and the state, guiding functionaries of plants and 
enterprises, deputies of power organs of various levels who 
discuss the political affairs of the country, heroes, 
professors, and doctors, thereby making their creative wisdom 
and talents flourish. 
  There have been a number of proud statesmen and great men 
who 
made a name for themselves, but we do not know of any great 
statesman and people's benevolent father like the dear comrade 
leader who embraces all the people of the country in his bosom 
and brings them up to be true revolutionaries. The song "There 
is no fatherland without you" sung by all the people of the 
country from the bottom of their hearts reveals the infinite 
gratitude and boundless extolment to the people's benevolent 
father [inminui chaaeroun oboi] who takes total responsibility 
for and blooms their destiny and future. 
  Our people's great pride in upholding the great father 
consists in all the people fully enjoying infinitely rewarding, 
happy lives. The dear comrade leader whose natural disposition 
consists of love for and trust in the people, worked out and put 
forth the lines and policies for the people so that all the 
activities of the party and the state may consistently serve the 
people. 
  Today, all policies and considerations for people worked 
out and taken in our country and the deep concern and scrupulous 
care extended evenly to each individual household and each 
individual person by our party and state are precious fruits 
brought about by the great father's noble politics of 
benevolence. The dear comrade leader has designated the 
promotion of people's welfare the supreme principle in our 
party's activities, and with the improvement in people's lives, 
has given all kinds of consideration to provide them with 
greater joy and happiness. 
  The dear comrade leader's firm position is that there can 
never be satisfaction in the struggle to improve people's 
livelihood and that greater happiness for the people should be 
achieved by all means by even seeing to it that mountains are 
leveled off or oceans reclaimed. 
  Through modern streets and numerous monumental 
structures--the Kwangbok Street, the Chongchun Street, the 
Tongil Street, the West Sea Floodgate, and the 1 May 
Stadium--which have been built in recent years, our people are 
warmly cherishing the dear comrade leader's fatherly love for 
the people and his energetic leadership. 
  Today, our people firmly believe that tomorrow will be 
better 
than today with our party's revolutionary economic strategies 
implemented by the great leader [yondoja]. The noble intention 
of the dear comrade leader--who is solving the question of 
improving people's livelihood while regarding it not as a simple 
economic task, but as both a strategic question for socialist 
construction and as an important matter linked with the future 
of the fatherland and people--is reflected in our party's 
revolutionary economic strategies for thoroughly implementing 
the agriculture-first policy, the light industry-first policy, 
and the trade-first policy. 
  Under today's difficult circumstances in which we need to 
achieve socialist construction in the midst of acute 
confrontation with the imperialists, formulation and 
implementation of grand economic strategies aimed at providing 
our people with a more affluent and happier life is by no means 
a simple question. This is a great idea and great project which 
can be worked out and implemented only by the dear comrade 
leader who is endlessly sparing no pains for the people. 
  The boundless happiness of our people holding the great 
father in esteem also lies in everyone helping and guiding one 
another, and living harmoniously in one large revolutionary 
household. 
  Today, our country has become one large revolutionary 
household thanks entirely to the brilliant embodiment of the 
dear comrade leader's noble politics of benevolence. Regarding 
the idea of valuing the people as heaven as his personal motto, 
the dear comrade leader spares nothing for the people's 
happiness and future. Our society is literally becoming one 
large revolutionary household because the dear comrade leader's 
politics of benevolence is brilliantly being embodied and 
because the revolutionary sense of obligation and camaraderie 
are coming into bloom throughout the country. 
  Though they have been born in different places, have 
different revolutionary duties, and have different personalities 
and tastes, our party members and workers are living today while 
holding each other dear in a genuine relationship of comradeship. 
  There is no country anywhere in the world as our country, a 
society in which all people throughout the country share life 
and death by helping and guiding each other, vigorously march 
forward by upholding the leader's [yongdojaui] intentions and 
ideas with singlehearted loyalty, can see his own hope and 
talent realized and brought into full bloom without worrying 
whatsoever about daily life, and are most thoroughly guaranteed 
of their dignity and rights, because they are holding the great 
leader [yongdoja] in esteem as the father. 
  Our people's firm belief and will are to show complete 
loyalty and filial piety, upholding the dear comrade leader who 
is taking full responsibility for their fate and future and 
bringing them into blossom. There are no people in the world 
like our dignified and happy people who are living in the most 
glorious era and carrying out the revolution, while holding the 
dear comrade leader in esteem as the father.

<F P=106> [Radio essay: "Let Us Glorify Chuche-Oriented Revolutionary </F>
Tradition for All Ages to Come"] 
  [Text] The revolutionary tradition is the historic root of 
the revolution. It is not only the blood vessel of the 
revolution, but is also the cornerstone of the revolution, which 
links generations into one lifeline in the course of the 
revolution. 
  Only when the revolutionary tradition is purely carried on 
can the revolution constantly advance along the straight road 
designated by the leader [suryong] and all sorts of hardships 
and trials be surmounted. Historic experience and the situation 
shown in today's revolutionary movement have left a bitter 
lesson that the revolution runs off its track, its generations 
are cut off, and the precious revolutionary gains won with blood 
by the preceding generations and patriotic revolutionary 
forefathers are lost when it fails to firmly defend and purely 
maintain its lineage. This was eloquently proven by the collapse 
of socialism in East European countries. 
  Today our party and people are resolutely safeguarding, 
defending, constantly inheriting, developing, and enriching the 
anti-Japanese revolutionary tradition created by the great 
leader under the wise and tested leadership of the dear comrade 
leader. All successes attained by our people in their rewarding 
struggle to consummate the chuche revolutionary cause are the 
immortal merits attained by our dear comrade leader in the 
course of brilliantly inheriting and developing the 
anti-Japanese revolutionary tradition. 
  The revolutionary tradition of our party and people is a 
most 
brilliant one unprecedented in the history of the movement of 
socialist, communist revolution in terms of the profoundness and 
richness of its contents, in terms of its width and depth, and 
in terms of its driving force and vitality. 
  Our revolutionary tradition is the great chuche-oriented 
revolutionary tradition, the one and only tradition of this 
world, which was created by the great leader and which is being 
purely inherited and developed by the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il. 
  On the days of the arduous and bloody anti-Japanese 
resistance the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song brilliantly 
created the immortal chuche idea by embodying the demands of the 
times and the aspirations of the people and pioneered the 
revolution independently and creatively. On this course he 
provided the glorious chuche revolutionary tradition, which is 
the cornerstone for ages to come. 
  The chuche-oriented revolutionary cause that the great 
leader 
constantly developed and enriched on the days of building of a 
new democratic Korea after national liberation and on the days 
of leading the totally new socialist revolution and construction 
to the single road of victory following the fierce fatherland 
liberation war is being further deepened and developed on the 
historic march road on which the dear comrade leader is modeling 
the whole society after the chuche idea. 
  The revolution's guiding ideology, guiding theory, and 
guiding method which are the guiding principle in revolutionary 
struggle and construction are extensively and broadly embodied 
in our revolutionary tradition and the noble revolutionary 
achievements and rich struggle experience is reflected in it. 
This is why our revolutionary tradition is shining as the 
immortal banner which firmly ensures the consummation of the 
chuche revolutionary cause and as the brilliant beacon which 
opens an infinitely bright path ahead of our revolution. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: Our 
party 
has consistently and resolutely safeguarded and defended the 
glorious revolutionary tradition created by the leader [suryong] 
and is extensively inheriting and developing in conformity with 
the demands of modeling the whole society after the chuche idea. 
  The dear comrade leader defined it as an important task to 
resolutely defend the chuche revolutionary tradition provided by 
the great leader on the days of his anti-Japanese resistance and 
takes it as an invariable iron rule to purely defend the chuche 
revolutionary tradition and to apply it in the revolution and 
construction. 
  One day in October 1964, when our party entered a new stage 
in the course of its development, the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il called in a functionary and urgently told him that the 
tradition that we advocate is not a tradition of mere patriotism 
but a chuche revolutionary tradition, in other words, it is not 
only a problem related to the historic roots of the party and 
the revolution, but is also a problem related to the bloodline 
which carries forward the party and the revolution. 
  Hearing the dear comrade leader's unique ideology and theory 
on the revolutionary tradition, the functionary was deeply moved 
by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's firm faith and strong 
will to firmly defend the purity of the revolutionary tradition. 
  [Text] Also, during the days of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il's on-the-spot guidance of the revolutionary battle site 
in Yanggang Province, the precious revolutionary tradition 
achieved during the anti-Japanese armed struggle period was 100 
percent succeeded and 100 percent fulfilled. Therefore, he once 
again clearly elucidated the rock firm position and strong will 
to complete the Korean revolution to the end as intended by the 
great leader. 
  One-hundred percent succession and 100 percent fulfillment. 
This is a high intention of the dear comrade leader who said 
that this was a cherished desire of the many Korean communists 
who passed away first after sacrificing their lives to defend 
the headquarters of the revolution. When this kind of firm 
faith and iron-like will of the dear comrade leader was echoing 
along the mountain ridges of Mt. Paektu, this made all the 
people's hearts wrapped up in a solemn feeling. 
  The dear comrade leader cleanly washed out all kinds of odds 
and ends with Paektu's clear spirit and energy and firmly 
adhered to the chuche-oriented bloodline. Therefore, he 
maintained our party into a militant and iron-like party that 
has vigor and our people into an invincible force who are firmly 
united around the party and the leader. 
  What is the most beautiful song our people like to sing, and 
what song do our people enjoying singing the most today? That 
song is the revolutionary song highly sung by the members of the 
Saenal Juvenile League of Musong during the dawning of our 
revolution, and it is an immortal revolutionary song proudly 
sung by the first youth vanguards of Korea on the advance road 
of our revolution in admiration of the great leader. 
  What are the immortal towers most magnificently and most 
highly rising on this land today? They are the immortal 
historic revolutionary monuments which were established in each 
sacred track left by the great leader during the arduous period 
when our revolutionary cause was being pioneered for the first 
time. 
  Beginning from Mt. Paektu, there are revolutionary battle 
sites and historic places of revolution everywhere in our 
country. In all revolutionary battle sites and historic places 
of revolution including Mangyongdae, Ponghwari, Mt. Paektu, 
Samjiyon, Chongbyong, Pochonbo, Popyong, Wangsejan, they are 
permeated with the great leader's revolutionary history and 
immortal revolutionary achievements in which he made his way 
through the thorn thickets of the arduous struggle in the 
forefront and led our revolution to the one road of victory and 
glory. 
  Reflecting our people's earnest desire to convey the great 
leader's immortal achievements generation after generation, the 
dear comrade leader energetically led all the work in 
maintaining all the country's revolutionary battle sites and 
historic places of revolution. Therefore, revolutionary assets 
of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle period were revived 
in its original form. Thus, it was possible to advocate, adhere 
to, and eternally elucidate the great leader's revolutionary 
struggle history, revolutionary activities, and lofty leadership 
achievements generation after generation. It was also possible 
to wholly, purely, and extensively succeed and develop the 
chuche-oriented revolutionary tradition achieved by the leader, 
and it was possible to be elucidated as a revolutionary asset of 
a far-reaching plan and a cornerstone of the revolution. 
  Embodying the revolutionary tradition in the revolution 
and construction, and the life and work is the course of 
developing and inheriting the revolutionary tradition and, on 
this course, the revolutionary cause can be inherited and 
consummated. 
  The purpose of developing and inheriting the revolutionary 
tradition is consummating the revolutionary cause till the end 
by thoroughly embodying it in the people's work and life, and in 
every domain of the revolution and construction. If the 
revolutionary tradition is not embodied, it would only remain as 
a legacy or a historic fact, and lose its vitality as an origin 
of the revolution development. 
  Accordingly, the dear comrade leader has launched the 
historic march of modeling the whole society after the chuche 
idea and lifted high the revolutionary slogan urging the people 
to carry on their overall social life in the way the 
anti-Japanese guerrilla army did. "Producing, studying, and 
living in an anti-Japanese guerrilla army way," the slogan calls 
on the people to inherit the glorious revolutionary tradition to 
today's life and worksand, thus, fully bloom the tradition. The 
slogan carries the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's resolute 
faith and will to endlessly inherit and develop a revolutionary 
treasure which the great leader himself achieved during the 
period in which our revolutionary cause was pioneered for the 
first time. 
  The slogan calls for inheriting and embodying the 
revolutionary tradition in everyday thinking and mental 
activities, not keeping it as a mere historic record or a 
knowledge. The presentation of such slogan has brought about a 
new landmark not only in the economic and cultural construction, 
but also in the people's way of thinking and work. 
  How is it that the upright spirit of self-reliance and hard 
struggle flutter in every domain of our country's construction 
and production? How is it that the wind of speed campaign 
furiously came up? How is it that the entire country turned 
into an anti- Japanese guerrilla army-style learning site which 
resembles the university of revolution and the studying ground 
of (?Madanggou and Paeksughan)? How is it that the entire 
country is filled with the ranks of forerunners of communist 
virtues, hidden heroes, and hidden men of merit? How is it that 
the Song of Comrade is warmly resounding from the hearts of not 
only the first generation of the revolution, but also the second 
and third generations? 
  This is because the dear comrade leader is giving upright 
guidance to consolidate the glorious chuche-oriented 
revolutionary tradition as an everlasting footstone of our 
revolution and a durable foundation for the cause of modeling 
the whole society after the chuche idea, and to embody the 
tradition in everyone's work and life. 
  No matter how stern and dark the situation may be, we are 
surmounting the imperialists' ever-aggravating maneuvers to 
isolate and crush us in the way the invincible anti-Japanese 
guerrilla army did -- overcoming all sorts of difficulties with 
firm confidence in victory and optimism. Likewise, we are 
creating a new history of endless upsurges and advancement in 
the socialist construction. Because there is the dear comrade 
leader, a true hero of heroes, a great commander of commanders, 
and a great figure of our time, our people are accelerating the 
construction and revolution in the way the people did on the 
days of the anti-Japanese struggle even though so many years 
have passed. 
  Kang Yong-sil, lecturer at the Korean Revolutionary 
Museum, speaks about her impression felt during her meeting with 
numerous visitors at home and abroad and foreign friends who 
came to learn the chuche-oriented revolutionary tradition: 
  [Begin Kang recording] The chuche-oriented revolutionary 
tradition which was created by the great leader and which is 
being purely inherited and developed by the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong- il is a loftiest and purest revolutionary tradition 
which cannot be found in elsewhere. Because the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il defends, adheres to, inherits, and enriches 
our revolutionary tradition, our revolution is winning victory 
after victory, unflinching even under whatever hardships and 
trials as the spirit of anti-Japanese struggle and the 
temperament of Mt. Paektu. Hence, we take it as honor and pride 
to have such chuche-oriented revolutionary tradition which is 
incomparably better than anything else in the world. 
  Numerous foreign friends and guests who visited the Korean 
Revolutionary Museum unanimously envied the Korean people for 
having the chuche revolutionary tradition and fervently extolled 
the Korean revolutionary tradition as the one and only tradition 
of the world. Asking who has brought the Korean revolutionary 
tradition into full bloom, they then praised the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il as the greatest and the most excelled 
inheritor and leader [yongdoja] of the chuche-oriented 
revolutionary tradition. Whenever they praise him, we cannot 
help taking greatest pride in being the Korean people who have 
the great chuche-oriented revolutionary tradition. 
  We, as in the past, will fully unfold our revolutionary 
tradition under the wise leadership of the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il. [End Kang recording] 
  Truly, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's lofty 
achievements -- making the chuche revolutionary tradition which 
was created amid the arduous anti-Japanese flame be inherited 
for good without loosing its glare even if myriad years pass, 
and letting boundless vitality and attraction be displayed even 
in the future communist society -- will glorify for all ages to 
come, and will push forward our people's revolutionary struggle 
to consummate the chuche- oriented revolutionary tradition. 
  Today, our people have won the world-renowned fame for being 
proud and glorious people who have the great chuche-oriented 
revolutionary tradition. With invincible faith, our people are 
fighting and living staunchly even under the situation in which 
the imperialists' anti-socialist, anti-Republic maneuvers are 
getting more vicious than ever. This is because there is the 
wise leadership of the party and the leader [suryong], and the 
brilliant revolutionary tradition of having smashed the 
formidable evil imperialist enemy. 
  Our people, as in the past, will invariably defend and 
adhere 
to the chuche-oriented revolutionary tradition and glorify it 
for all ages to come. Bearing in mind lofty meanings inscribed 
on trees by anti-Japanese fighters with writing brushes, we will 
fight and live in the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu as 
during the days of anti-Japanese struggle without missing one 
foot. 
  The road we are traversing now is the road of revolution 
which reaches the secret camp of Mt. Paektu. On this road, we 
will consummate the chuche-oriented revolutionary cause for sure 
by inheriting the anti-Japanese revolutionary spirit to next 
generation and faithfully upholding the leadership of the 
respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.

  [Text] Jakarta, May 27 (ANTARA) -- Indonesia Friday hailed 
reported efforts by private parties in the Philippines to have a 
controversial conference on East Timor in Manila called off. 
  "We feel relieved and appreciate the efforts of the 
Philippine Government, the Indonesia-Philippine Association and 
all parties concerned to have the conference barred," Irawan 
Abidin, information director at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
said. 
  News agency reports from Manila had said the Quezon City 
court Friday issued an order putting a 20-day hold on the 
conference after receiving a petition from the 
Indonesia-Philippine Association that described the conference 
as a violation of a treaty binding member countries of ASEAN 
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations). 
  The friendship association, which is headed by Jose Laurel, 
member of a Philippine political group, charged that the holding 
of the conference was a dangerous threat to the Philippines' 
national security and interests. 
  It also said the planned conference could harm the friendly 
relations among and The Treaty of Amity and Cooperation of the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations signed by the 
Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand in 1976. 
  Under the Quezon City court order the rector of the 
University of the Philippines where the conference was to take 
place, will have to disallow the holding of the conference on 
university premises for 20 days. 
  The conference was to open on May 31. 
  Abidin said the Indonesia-Philippine Association would 
possibly make further efforts for the complete cancellation of 
the conference or its relocation to another country.

Italy, government sources said Wednesday [1 June]. 
  The sources said the two leaders' talks in Naples will focus 
on the status of progress in the recently resumed bilateral 
trade "framework" negotiations, as well as the North Korean 
nuclear issue. 
  Hata is scheduled to leave Japan on July 7, arriving in Rome 
later on the same day and then proceeding overland to Naples, 
the sources said. 
  After Hata and Clinton meet July 8, the two leaders will 
participate in a G-7 dinner meeting on the same day, they said. 
  The sources said the idea of holding the bilateral summit in 
Naples was proposed by Washington, but the Japanese side would 
prefer to have the talks held in another European capital such 
as London.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
on Wednesday [1 June] reopened the "framework" trade talks after 
a three-and-a-half-month deadlock over a U.S. demand for 
"objective criteria" to gauge foreign access to Japanese markets. 
  Last Tuesday, the two countries announced that they would 
resume the talks in three priority areas -- Japanese Government 
procurement of medical equipment and telecommunications, auto 
and auto parts and insurance. 
  The talks bogged down at the February summit meeting between 
then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton in Washington. 
  According to the announcement after exploratory talks in 
Washington, Japan and the U.S. agreed not to use "objective 
criteria" as "numerical targets" in accessing the openness of 
the Japanese markets to foreign goods and services. 
  Eisuke Sakakibara, deputy chief of the Finance Ministry's 
International Finance Bureau, heads the Japanese side, and 
assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Japan and China Ira Wolf 
leads the U.S. delegation at the two-day talks on insurance. 
  Among focal points at the talks is the pace of the 
liberalization of Japan's insurance business in the "third 
field," which deals with accident, nursing care and disease 
insurance. 
  The U.S. has called on Japan to "slow down" the pace of 
liberalization because of foreign insurers dominance in that 
business area. 
  The two countries will also resume talks on auto and auto 
parts on Thursday in Washington and government procurement on 
Friday in Tokyo.

<F P=106> ["Statement of UN Security Council President on Replacement </F>
of Fuel Rods Refuted" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 1 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
today published a statement refuting the statement of the 
president of the Security Council of the United Nations decrying 
the DPRK over the replacement of fuel rods at a reactor. 
  Follows the full text of the statement: 
  The United Nations Security Council, on May 30, according to 
a scenario which had been worked out by some member states, 
published a statement of its president groundlessly slandering 
the DPRK and containing the unreasonable claim that the fuel 
rods must be replaced strictly in compliance with the practical 
demands of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the 
opportunity of selected separation and preservation of fuel rods 
might be lost. It is entirely wrong for the Security Council 
to have discussed the question of the DPRK on the basis of the 
wrong judgment made by the secretariat of the agency without any 
justifiable reason. 
  It was only a few days ago that negotiations on the 
refueling 
of the 5 megawatt experimental atomic power station was held 
between the DPRK and the agency. 
  The main question discussed at the negotiations was the 
preservation of technical possibilities of future measurement of 
replaced fuel rods and there was a sufficient debate on the 
reasonableness of the method applied by the DPRK at present. 
  The agency said it would seriously study that method and the 
two sides agreed to continue to discuss it in the future 
negotiations. 
  And it was confirmed that none of the fuel rods replaced 
this 
time had been diverted to another purpose and, practically, the 
whole course of current refueling is going on in the presence of 
agency inspectors and under a strict control of inspection 
cameras. 
  We must ask what justification the UN Security Council has 
to 
put the question of the DPRK on its agenda and discuss it now. 
  If things were to take a correct track, the Security Council 
should have called in question not the DPRK, but some quarters 
of the agency secretariat. 
  Before starting refueling, we had requested the agency 
several times to take necessary measures such as its presence 
and the removal of the seals. But it failed to send a group of 
inspectors till refueling began, thus openly neglecting its duty 
as an international organisation. This was what some quarters 
of the secretariat did. 
  Even when we allowed "an additional inspection" which 
alluded 
to "an inspection left incomplete" at the time of the inspection 
in March, they shunned it, thus intentionally ignoring the 
statement of the president of the UN Security Council dated 
March 31. 
  It was also the IAEA Secretariat that distorted the fact by 
talking as if the negotiation had broken down and hurriedly 
transferred the problem to the UN Security Council without a 
clear explanation, categorically denying the method of the DPRK 
even before the negotiating delegation of the IAEA which had 
promised to study it arrived at the head office in Vienna. 
  This act was aimed at putting the DPRK in the "[word 
indistinct]" by justifying their past behavior in concocting 
"inconsistency" against the DPRK on the basis of false 
information. 
  It is only too natural that DPRK which has engaged itself 
only in peaceful nuclear activities as a dignified independent, 
sovereign state will not yield to such unreasonable act of the 
IAEA Secretariat and allow itself to be treated as an "offender." 
  So, the UN Security Council, instead of finding fault with 
the DPRK, should have taken issue with some officials of the 
IAEA Secretariat who laid hurdles in the way of the DPRK's 
peaceful nuclear activities, framed a sinister political 
intrigue to shift the blame on to the DPRK and transferred the 
problem to the United Nations. 
  It is also self-contradictory that the presidential 
statement 
of the UN Security Council unreasonably urged the DPRK to allow 
selected separation and preservation of fuel rods and 
preservation of the possibility of future measurement. 
  Since we are in a unique status after a temporary suspension 
of the effectuation of our declared withdrawal from the NPT 
[Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty], it is clear that we cannot 
accept such routine and ad hoc inspection as selected 
preservation of fuel rods. A full understanding of this was 
reached at the recent negotiations with the IAEA. 
  Although we are refueling the reactor in a unique status, we 
are doing the utmost to show the transparency of our nuclear 
activities. 
  The refueling is taking place in such a manner as to fully 
preserve the technical possibility of measuring the fuel rods as 
requested by the IAEA when our unique status comes to an end. 
  This is a most scientific and realistic method invented by 
our scientists and facility operators with a high sense on 
cooperation, motivated by their consistent position to show the 
uprightness of the nuclear activities. Its feasibility has 
fully been proved through experiments. 
  If this method of our style is applied, it will be possible 
to reproduce the channel and order of any fuel rods and measure 
them correctly in the future. 
  At the recent negotiations in Pyongyang, we gave the IAEA 
side a full explanation of our-style method concerning the 
replacement of fuel rods and suggested with a good intention 
that if there were any more questions to be discussed, 
negotiations should be held any time. 
  There have been attempts these days to create the "urgency" 
of the situation by alleging that the pace of the refueling is 
too fast. Since it is part of the pure peaceful nuclear 
activities and technical possibilities for ensuring the 
continuity of safeguards and measuring fuel rods in the future 
are fully guaranteed, there is no ground for taking issue with 
the speed of refueling. 
  It was necessary to test the maximum efficiency of the 
refueling machine that our refueling progressed at a rather fast 
speed some time ago. This was also a normal course of the 
peaceful nuclear activities. So, this is hardly a matter for 
surprise. 
  Such being a case, at a time when everything is progressing 
on a normal track, the UN Security Council discussed the biased 
report submitted by some officials of the IAEA Secretariat 
without any examination and hurriedly adopted a presidential 
statement. It is really hard to understand. 
  This was because they were too dull to sense the reality or 
thy were affected by some sinister political background. 
  If the UN Security Council, for this matter, is 
disgracefully 
charged with being manipulated by some specified member nations 
while ignoring its noble mission to be responsible for world 
peace and security, it will be a shame to history. 
  Originally, the foundation of the existence of an 
international organisation is impartiality. 
  If the IAEA Secretariat and the UN Security Council, bereft 
of impartiality, insist on pressure with an unreasonable 
intention [words indistinct] feel any need to be restricted by 
such pressure. 
  It is more than intolerable that we have suffered from big 
obstacles in our peaceful nuclear activities, restricted by the 
unilateral demand of the IAEA. In case pressure is put on us 
again, we will no longer fall a victim to the unreasonable 
demand but will have to go our own way, unhindered by anything. 
  This is the unshakable will of the Korean people, who regard 
independence as their life and blood. 
  If some officials of the IAEA Secretariat declare that the 
technical possibilities of the future measurement of fuel rods 
were gone or the UN Security Council put pressure on the DPRK, 
threatening "sanctions" under that pretext, we cannot but take 
decisive countermeasures, rather freeing ourselves from such 
unreasonable restrictions than suffering from them, and we will 
be left with no other choice but to [word indistinct] over to 
the continuous process of the peaceful nuclear activities. We 
will respond any time with utmost sincerity to the intention to 
deal with the issue in a fair way and resolve it in a peaceful 
way through dialogue. But we will counter without slightest 
compromise any intention to unjustifiably put pressure on us, 
ignoring our sovereignty, if but a little.

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 27 May commentary: "A Shameful Spokesman for </F>
Splittist Forces"] 
  [Text] The Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean 
puppets are making an attempt to arouse the public opinion by 
slandering our reunification formula through a confederal 
system, regarding the fact that Yemen, which was reunified four 
years ago, has recently entered into a situation of internal 
conflict. 
  Japan's SANKEI SHIMBUM reported in an article regarding the 
internal conflict in Yemen that the confederal system -- under 
which the North and South would be reunified by leaving their 
systems as they are without a political merger on the Korean 
peninsula -- is shaky, and that it may even bring about a war. 
  South Korea's CHOSON ILBO reported that reunification 
through 
the confederal system would promise [word indistinct] caused by 
the internal conflict in the future, and that a war must be 
avoided even if the reunification is delayed. 
  Such assertions by some Japanese and South Korean 
newspapers, 
as backing sophistry made by splittist forces at home and 
abroad, have created obstacles to the reunification of Korea 
and, also, are insidious plots to perpetuate national division 
and confrontation. 
  As reported by foreign newspapers, the reason for Yemen's 
plunge into a crisis situation today, due to its bloody internal 
conflict, is not only because it is reunified without achieving 
reconciliation and unity between North and South Yemen, but 
because it was not able to guarantee the balance of power or 
merge the Armed Forces even after the reunification. 
Considering the background of its internal conflict, this will 
clearly prove the justification and reasonableness of our 
reunification formula through the confederal system. 
  It is reported that North and South Yemen have reunified 
their country based on an agreement between the heads of the two 
sides without achieving reconciliation and unity. On the other 
hand, our reunification formula through the confederal system 
clearly defines an ideological basis and principle of the great 
unity of the whole nation for national reunification. This 
reunification formula is based on the national sentiment and an 
ideology of national independence, as well as plans to establish 
a national reunified state embodying the principle of promoting 
coexistence, coprosperity, and public interests. 
  Our reunified state through the confederal system regards 
the 
common demands and interests of the nation as its basic mission 
and, also, is the most reasonable form as a reunified state that 
makes it possible to achieve national unity, transcending the 
difference of ideas [sasang], ideology [inyom], and systems. 
  Our reunification formula through the confederal system 
gives 
the highest priority to the nation over the system and, also, is 
the reunified formula deployed based on national ideology. 
Therefore, this formula has elucidated the most practical and 
reasonable way to realize national reunification by achieving 
national reconciliation and unity even under the situations in 
which the two different systems exist between the North and 
South. 
  It is also reported that the merge has been made in Yemen 
without a structural guarantee that can sufficiently maintain 
the balance of political forces representing the North and 
South. However, our reunification formula through the 
confederal system has prepared a structural guarantee that makes 
it possible to establish the national reunified government made 
up of the same number of delegates from the North and South 
based on the local governments that can fully exercise their 
autonomous rights; that enables the North and South to take 
turns in operating it and to equally share the function and 
authority of the confederal government and local government; 
and that makes it possible for other political forces to 
equally exercise their rights. 
  For the governments of the two regions of the North and 
South to equally participate in the confederal system guarantees 
equality in the two autonomous regions to consolidate national 
unity, equally realizes the interests of the two regions in 
operating the confederal system, and makes it possible to 
achieve common prosperity of the nation. This is a superior and 
unique form of a confederal system. 
  Then, in Yemen, the North and South maintained each other's 
forces and the leadership was unified in a situation in which it 
was under a separate control. Apart from this, our 
reunification method through the confederal system anticipates 
that each Army of the North and South be drastically reduced to 
100,000-150,000 each; unify each other's Army to organize a 
single national united Army; and put this under the unified 
command of the confederal government. Therefore, apprehensions 
on invasion from the North, invasion from the South, victory 
over communism, and communization will disappear, and there is a 
military security device to maintain solid peace. 
  Truly, the fatherland's reunification method through the 
confederal system based on one nation, one state, two system, 
and two governments, is the most just and practical national 
reunification program which makes it possible to most quickly 
realize the country's reunification independently and peacefully 
without someone not swallowing the other or being swallowed by 
the other under the condition in which other ideology and 
systems exist in North and South Korea. 
  As we have seen, there is a fundamental difference in the 
principle of reunification, method, and content in the process 
of unification in Yemen and our reunification method through the 
confederal system. Nevertheless, slandering our reunification 
method through the confederal system by unreasonably linking it 
with the Yemen situation, without even researching it, stems 
from an insidious political goal. 
  The Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean puppets are 
opposing our reunification method through the confederal system 
to perpetuate Korea's division, and are persistently preventing 
peace and reunification on the Korean peninsula. 
  In connection with the Yemen situation, some media in Japan 
and South Korea are slandering our reunification method. This 
speaks for the true intention of the insidious forces who want 
to perpetuate division. 
  For the media, which regard justice and truth as life, to 
become a tool of the splittists opposing peace and reunification 
on the Korean peninsula which the Korean people and the world's 
peace- loving people are consistently desiring, is indeed 
nothing but a shameful act of tarnishing their own face. 
  Our reunification method through the confederal system is 
receiving a wide range of support and approval from the fellow 
countrymen of the North, South, and overseas in its justness and 
practicality with each passing day. Splittists at home and 
abroad cannot prevent our nation's strong trend which is moving 
toward the fatherland's reunification with any kind of schemes, 
obstructions, and maneuvers. 
  Through united strength, our nation will eliminate barriers 
and difficulties lying ahead in the road of the fatherland's 
reunification, and realize the country's reunification without 
fail according to the reunification method through the 
confederal system.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 31 (KCNA) -- Medical workers of Korea 
have produced many inventions and new technical innovation 
proposals over the last one year. 
  Nearly 40 kinds of tonics and medicines of 400 categories 
and 
new rational technical proposals have been produced by 
pharmaceutists. 
  Noteworthy among them are Chinju pills for cleansing the 
brain, and medicines which are made of Koryo elongatum maxim, 
and chlorophyll isolated from silkworms' discharge. 
  Chlorophyll is highly popular as a natural tonic. It is 
specially effective for arteriosclerosis, hypertension, gastric 
ulcer, diabetes, neuralgia, hemorrhage, etc. It is used also in 
making tooth paste and coloring matters in the daily necessities 
and foodstuff industries. An absorbent from silkworm's 
discharge has over 65 percent absorption rate. It is very 
effective for purifying the blood and eliminating poison by 
medicaments, harmful gas and toxic materials. 
  Tea, honey and extracts from Koryo elongatum maxim which 
grows in the area of Mt. Peaktu, the northernmost region of 
Korea, elevate the mental state and recover memory and energy 
and also serve as good tonics. They prove especially effective 
for neurasthenia and physical weakness and increase sexual 
functions of the old. Medical workers of the hospital of the 
Pyongyang University of medicine have developed over 50 kinds of 
curative and preventive medicines and reagents, while giving 
medical assistance to working people. 
  Tanmimol tablet, medium for negionella and aceroni injection 
are highly assessed by medical workers. Tanmimol tablet is 
specially good for acute and chronic enteritis, colitis, 
dysentery and paratyphus. 
  The Red Cross General Hospital of Korea, the Kim Man-yu 
hospital and hospitals of provincial universities of medicine 
have developed many highly effective medical appliances, which 
are actively introduced into clinical practice. 
  The device of diagnosis and therapy by modulation waves, the 
centesimal computer of blood corpuscles and the noise neoro 
metre of diagnosis and therapy are typical medical appliances 
devised by medical workers of the Kim Man-yu hospital in recent 
years. 
  The device of diagnosis and therapy by modulation waves 
efficacious for rheumatic arthritis, neuralgia and insomnia was 
awarded an international invention prize. It proves highly 
effective by stimulating the skin of the patient without using 
of drugs. Simple in mechanism and portable, it is very popular 
among the patients. 
  Medical workers across the country have put forward many new 
technical proposals to meet the growing demands for medicaments 
and medical appliances and improve their quality.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, May 31 KYODO -- A document circulated 
among inner government circles in China warns that a United 
States- backed Pan-Mongolian movement could lead to the 
partitioning of China, it was learned Tuesday [31 May]. 
  Relations between China and Mongolia are on the surface 
good, 
following a visit to Mongolia in April by Chinese Premier Li 
Peng to sign a new Sino-Mongolian friendship pact. 
  But the document warns that China should move to head off 
the 
development of a Pan-Mongolian ideology because it could 
threaten China's territorial integrity. 
  The document was published in October by a public research 
institute specializing in Northeast Asian affairs in China's 
Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region. 
  Mongolia is home to some 2.1 million Mongols, but the 
autonomous region has 4.8 million, while a further 300,000 are 
in Russia. 
  The document cites as symptomatic of the problem the first 
world conference of Mongolian peoples, held in the Mongolian 
capital of Ulaanbaatar in September last year. 
  It says the conference strengthened Pan-Mongolianism and 
says 
that "this fundamental problem which is related to the 
partitioning of China cannot be ignored." 
  Noting that organizers of the conference visited the U.S. 
prior to the forum, the document said "the U.S. is extending 
its evil influence into the Mongolian plateau and is trying in 
the background to stab China with a sword it calls democracy." 
  The document also says Mongolian unification has supporters 
in Japan. 
  It suggests that China should prepare for a lengthy struggle 
and warns of the growth of ethnic movements in the former Soviet 
Union.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, May 26 (OANA-MONTSAME) [dateline as 
received] -- The official newspaper "ARDIYN ERH" informs that 
the spring session of the Great State Hural has accomplished the 
discussion of the draft law on the protection of historical and 
cultural monuments. According to the draft law the monuments of 
culture and history having been illegally taken abroad should be 
declared to be the state-owned property and the responsibility 
for their returning home will be born by the Central 
Organization of Culture under the jurisdiction of the 
government. The law will take force starting 1 September of the 
year. 
  The newspaper publishes an article by an MP T. Sultan [name 
as received] devoted to the problem of privatization of houses 
in which he is standing for the free turning over the houses to 
their tenants. The author provides a number of reasons 
explaining his suggestion including that that many old dwelling 
houses have already been re-paid, the tenants have to carry out 
the repairing at their own expenses and that the state will gain 
proper profits in the form of payments for electricity and water 
supplies stressing the fact that the city resident has not 
mainly got in his possession any other property apart from his 
own house where he lives which is the most significant and 
strong argument. 
  According to the newspaper, the former premier of Mongolia 
D. 
Byambasuren [name as received] has been called to criminal 
responsibility as an accused one. The General Prosecutor's 
Office charges D. Byambasuren that he when being on the post of 
prime minister was well aware of the losses due to banking 
arbitrage transactions and did not take proper measures in due 
time being thus guilty in irresponsibility in reference to his 
official duties which caused great damage to the state. 
  The newspaper informs that at the invitation of the Great 
State Hural a parliamentary delegation from Indonesia headed by 
its Deputy-Chairman Surjadi has arrived in Mongolia. The 
delegation was met at the airport by the Deputy Chairman of the 
Great State Hural of Mongolia J. Gombojab. 
  The governmental newspaper "DZASGIIN GADZRYN MEDEE" reports 
that the president of the country P. Ochirbat will visit the 
Dornod Aymag from 25 to 28 May. In the course of the trip the 
president will get acquainted with the activities of some border 
units and call on the Halhgol and Sumber Somons. Also the Prime 
Minister P. Jasray took a working trip to the Dundgobi and 
Omnogobi Aymags during which he acquainted with the work of 
local enterprises and economic entities and was holding meetings 
with the working people. 
  The newspaper informs that an "Mongolian Technology and 
Invention-94" exhibition was opened in the Mongolian capital at

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Yasushi Akashi, special </F>
representative of the UN secretary-general, by editorial staff 
writer Atsuko Yamamoto, at the office of the UN Protection 
Forces in Zagreb on 17 May: "Isolationism in the United States 
Obstructs Peace"] 
  [Text] He has been criticized as weak by the United 
States, which has felt strongly about using military power. But 
in mid-February, the United Nations Protection Forces and NATO 
(North Atlantic Treaty Organization) succeeded in lifting the 
siege of Sarajevo, using the pressure of "bombing." Through the 
skillful use of carrots and sticks, they gained good results. 
Akashi told me this frankly. 
  "The analyses of the UN Protection Forces and NATO were 
exactly the same. We could have taken collaborative steps for 
Gorazde in April, too." 
  In late April, the shelling of the eastern town of Gorazde 
by 
the Serbian forces continued. NATO gave a bombing ultimatum, 
and Akashi, on the other hand, obtained a truce agreement from 
the leadership of the Serbian forces. NATO Secretary-General 
Woerner strongly pressed for carrying out the bombing, but 
Akashi did not consent. That is one of the reasons for the U.S. 
criticism. 
  "The removal of heavy artillery by the Serbian forces from 
within a 20 km radius of Gorazde was progressing in the right 
direction. Though we would expose violations as such, we could 
distinguish violations which would be critical to the truce 
agreement from other violations. I am positive that NATO, too, 
would not want to start bombing prematurely, when a weapon, 
which was totally useless, was found." 
  All sorts of risks accompany the use of military power. Even 
though the United States wants to demonstrate its leadership 
through bombing, Akashi cannot make up his mind so easily. 
  "If the UN Protection Forces abandon the character of being 
an objective third party, provision of humanitarian assistance, 
which was the original objective, cannot be realized. Even if 
military personnel were to remain, if the people engaged in 
humanitarian activities and the NGO's (non-governmental 
organizations) were to be viewed with hostility, then they could 
no longer remain in the area, which would be at odds with our 
priorities. It is necessary to look after the Protective 
Forces, which numbers over 30,000 personnel, and the people 
engaged in humanitarian aid. 
  When military power is to be used, we must always think 
about 
what would follow. Even the limited bombing in mid-April gave a 
great shock to the Serbian forces. About 150 Protective Forces 
personnel were consequently detained, and we had difficulty 
securing their release. 
  Those considerations are now ignored, and "rewarding good 
and 
punishing evil" permeates the atmosphere. In the democratic 
nations, it is an increasing phenomenon that the mass media has 
fallen into such a line, and the political leaders also have 
been influenced accordingly. It may make one feel good for 
awhile [to use military power], but then what happens afterward?" 
  Akashi's view did not match that of NATO. 
  "As a result of the Somalia experience, the expectations for 
the United Nations, which had grown in the post-Cold War era, 
have faded. If we fail in the former Yugoslavia, I believe that 
it will take us back about 10 years. We bear that 
responsibility. No matter how insistently we discuss this 
matter with NATO people, however, there are things they 
apparently fail to understand." 
  On 13 May, a conference of foreign ministers conference 
involving the United States, Russia, and five major EU countries 
was held, and the Bosnia situation entered a new phase. The 
foreign ministers conference set the ratio for territorial 
division at 51 percent for the Federated Moslem and Croatian 
forces, and 49 percent for Serbian forces. 
  "In Cambodia it made our work easier because the major 
countries were in agreement. But in the former Yugoslavia, 
there have been problems because they cannot keep in step. It 
is really great that the United States changed its policy on the 
decision of the 13th." 
  The premature recognition of independence by the former EC 
(European Community) headed by Germany and the frequently 
changing American responses led to the war becoming a quagmire. 
  "Last summer, the United States insisted on bombing, though 
it did not send to Bosnia any ground forces and had some 
disagreement with the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and other 
nations that had sent troops. 
  Moreover, the U.S. Government believes that Europe is too 
accommodating to the Serbs. It feels that it is not right to 
ignore their aggressive character and simply pursue peace. It 
wants to help the victim, the Bosnian Government side. It is a 
very good thing that such a gap has been filled. 
  Some observers believe that U.S. support is preventing the 
Bosnian Government from compromising and putting off peace. The 
U.S. Senate has adopted a resolution calling for the lifting of 
the arms embargo against Bosnia. 
  "Hmm. I decline to make any comment on that. It concerns 
a nation's domestic politics, and the U.S. Government has become 
touchy about my comments. Whatever I say will be misunderstood." 
  In late April, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations 
Albright 
strongly protested Akashi's remark that "the United States has 
been hesitant and timid since Somalia" as "a statement totally 
inappropriate for an international public servant." 
  "I have been equally critical of isolationism both within 
the 
United States and in Japan. I was not criticizing the U.S. 
Government. Rather, I am frustrated by the inward-looking 
attitude that has been emerging both in the United States and 
Japan. I expect that everyone with good sense understands this." 
  The Bosnian Government once demanded his dismissal because 
it 
felt he was partial to the Serbians. 
  "A neutral mediator is destined to be criticized by everyone 
in a dispute. I am philosophical about it and am prepared to 
see things through. Anyone who wishes to be praised by everyone 
can never take up such a task." 
  Before he assumed his post, he had said that chances for 
peace would not emerge in the absence of a feeling of 
war-weariness. Is the war-weary feeling now spreading? 
  "The Serbian forces probably feel that they have taken all 
they can take. They probably also feel it all right to cough up 
a portion of the territory taken. Croatia, which wishes to 
concentrate on domestic building, also wishes to pull out soon." 
  "But the Bosnian Government, basically the victim, strongly 
wishes to continue insisting on recovering territory while 
expecting support from the United States and other countries." 
  The Bosnian Government has expressed its dissatisfaction 
with 
its 51 percent share of territory. Some in the international 
community are also apprehensive that such a decision will result 
in the recognition of aggression by the Serbian forces. 
  "The issue is quality rather than quantity. Which land and 
which cities go to which side? What about access to the 
Adriatic Sea? It is possible to satisfy sufficiently each 
other's interests in a rough ratio." 
  But even if peace is achieved, if dissatisfaction remains 
there is the danger that the war will start all over again. 
  "The people must feel strongly about their own land where 
their ancestors have been buried. To leave such land behind is 
a great hardship. But otherwise, peace will never come." 
  "In addition to territories which are clearly divided, in 
some areas, mutual inter-mingling must be possible. It is 
important to advance somehow the coexistence among peoples while 
respecting popular nationalism." 
  "There is no clear theoretical solution for the 
contradiction 
of popular self-determination and coexistence. How do you let 
both have their way? As for the Serbian issue in the Claina 
Region in Croatia, I think that the Serbians will abandon the 
idea of independence if there are good prospects that their 
autonomy on a wide scale is guaranteed in the constitution." 
  It has been decided that peace-keeping forces will be sent 
to 
Rwanda, where about 200,000 people have been massacred during 
the civil war. The danger of regional strife is swirling 
throughout the world. To what extent should the United Nations 
get involved? 
  "It depends on where the general consensus of the 
international community is. The other day, Secretary-General 
Ghali said in Paris that Europe and the United States become 
exited and seek to intervene when seventy people are killed in 
the market place in Sarajevo but would not lift a finger even if 
hundreds die in Africa. 
  "The time will come when the issues of security and peace 
will be viewed from a global perspective rather than in terms of 
a single country. But that is a winding road, and it may take 
one to two centuries. Until then, each country will view things 
with a regional distortion." 
  As the sending of peace keeping forces to Rwanda was stalled 
because of U.S. opposition, the United Nations today can not 
take actions transcending the national interests of its member 
countries. 
  "I have been daily struggling, acting with the thought of 
showing the unique UN capabilities. I also receive all sorts of 
criticism because of it. The United Nations is a living 
organism. It is not a perfect one, but it is not a totally 
defective one. I think Japan, too, should participate in the 
process of creating the ideal United Nations. 
  What do you expect from Japan? 
  "Japan, reflecting upon the war, shifted to pacifism and, 
under the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, has grown like bean 
sprouts in a green house. Japan has not been tossed around by 
the rough waves of international relations." 
  "But the time has come for Japan to pay the cost of peace. 
Desiring to become a permanent member of the Security Council is 
fine. But unless Japan defines what it wants to seek, what it 
wants to achieve, it will run the risk that its diplomacy will 
be detached from the people." 
  "At this point, Japan should participate actively in 
peacekeeping activities. Unlike Germany or Turkey, which have 
historical ties, Japan's hands are clean when it comes to the 
former Yugoslavia. Japan has even fewer problems politically 
sending forces there than in sending them to Cambodia." 
  "If Bosnia is difficult, it would be good if Japan were to 
consider sending them to Macedonia and Croatia." 
  Akashi said that when we send troops for peacekeeping 
activities, we have to expect some degree of loss and sacrifice. 
  "For a police officer, dying in the line of duty, whether in 
Japan or abroad, has the same meaning. To say that dying for 
the United Nations is bad is, I think, an example of Japanese 
self- righteousness and an insular mentality." 
  Is a police officer killing someone in self-defense the same 
as a Japanese sent to a foreign country as a member of an 
organized group killing a foreigner in self-defense? 
  "The point is in self-defense. I am against Japan alone 
deploying overseas. But in the former Yugoslavia, under the UN 
flag, it will act along with 35 other countries. If we consider 
the United Nations in its international and global dimensions, 
and can agree, then we should send people." 
  It has been about half a year since he arrived at his post. 
He is obliged to make decisions on daily developments in the 
situation while being the target of criticism from different 
directions. It is a lonely duty. 
  "I may be a masochist. The other day, Mrs. Sadako Ogata (the 
UN High Commissioner for Refugees) said on the phone that 'you 
are really hanging in there. You are probably so tenacious 
because you are from the Tohoku region.' I do not feel the 
pressure much. I may be optimistic, or perhaps insensitive. I 
act according to several somewhat simple principles."

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 31 May Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] Sector-by-sector negotiations in the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks will resume in Tokyo with negotiations 
on the insurance sector starting on 1 June. Likewise, 
negotiations on automobiles and auto parts will open in 
Washington on 2 June, and those on government procurement of 
telecommunications equipment and medical equipment in Tokyo on 3 
and 7 June, respectively. 
  In the automobile negotiations, U.S. Under Secretary of 
Commerce Jeffrey Garten will come to Japan in the week of 6 
June, and hold vice ministerial-level talks with Sozaburo 
Okamatsu, deputy vice minister of international trade and 
industry. 
  Apart from the above three priority sectors, discussions on 
intellectual property rights, one of the other five sectors the 
United States wants to negotiate, will also begin in Washington 
around 10 June. 
  After the recent informal meetings in Washington which 
resulted in the decision to resume the framework talks, 
working-level talks are being held to finalize concrete points 
of agreement for each sector. 
  Of the three priority sectors, the issue of liberalizing 
insurance covering injury and illness, where U.S. companies have 
an advantage, is expected to be the focal issue in insurance 
sector negotiations. 
  Negotiations on government procurement and automobiles and 
auto parts will concentrate on the issue of "objective 
criteria," on which no conclusion was reached in previous 
unofficial discussions. 
  On intellectual property rights, copyright protection for 
computer software, and standardization of the patent systems in 
Japan and the United States are expected to be the topics of 
discussion.

<F P=106> [By Shigeru Komago] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 29 May -- After the resumption of 
sector-by-sector negotiations in the Japanese-U.S. economic 
framework talks, the question of whether "figures for the 
future" should be included as objective criteria is expected to 
be a focal issue once again. If the United States insists on 
numerical indicators for such supplementary categories as the 
increase in stores selling foreign products, which it is 
proposing in place of "numerical targets," conflict may arise 
again. This may even undermine the basic agreement already 
reached at unofficial consultations on the "participation and 
sales increases of foreign products." The following looks at 
the points of agreement and remaining differences between Japan 
and the United States on the eve of reopening the negotiations. 
Points of Agreement [subhead] 
  According to sources in the Japanese and U.S. negotiating 
teams, compared to the time that the framework talks broke down 
last February, both sides compromised at the recent unofficial 
meetings which resulted in the resumption of negotiations. In 
the first place, the United States backed off on its demand for 
"numerical targets" which set a specific amount of increase in 
imports or sales until a specific point in time in the future -- 
the greatest stumbling block in the talks. It also did not ask 
for a deadline for concluding the talks. 
  Japan also compromised on the issue of the objective of the 
framework talks, giving up its stand of July 1993 that the talks 
are meant to "effect an overall increase" in the participation 
and sales of competitive foreign products in the Japanese 
market, and accepting "sector-by-sector increases" in market 
participation and sales as the negotiations' objective. While 
some people are still negative about sales increase in 
insurance, this is still a major concession on Japan's part 
compared to its position last February that "we cannot promise 
any increase in the future." 
  In short, the United States gave up its demand to set 
numerical targets for imports and sales, while Japan compromised 
on the framework talks' objective by accepting sector-by-sector 
increases. 
Differences and Ambiguous Points [subhead] 
  In previous sector-by-sector negotiations, the question of 
the application of the objective criteria was not resolved. 
Instead of insisting on its previous position that this should 
apply only to "past results," Japan has now indicated a 
willingness to accept the application of such criteria on the 
number of dealers, past sales trends, and other "indicators" of 
expanded market opportunities, which it opposed last February. 
  Taking advantage of this concession, the United States is 
now 
asking for the inclusion of "figures for the future" with regard 
to the supplementary indicators which do not directly reflect 
imports and sales, and this is considered to be merely a 
roundabout form of "seminumerical targets." A typical example 
of this is the proposal on figures for the future on the "number 
of dealers of foreign products" and so forth in the negotiations 
on automobiles and auto parts. 
  In government procurement -- for instance, 
telecommunications 
-- which is entirely under government control, the United States 
may renew its demand to set future numerical indicators for the 
"procurement volume" itself. 
  If the United States insists on such proposals and Japan 
refuses stubbornly, saying "these are numerical targets," the 
negotiations may break down again. However, certain U.S. 
sources claim that "bringing up future numerical indicators 
again for the supplementary categories is merely a negotiating 
technique of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative 
(USTR)." They say that it is doubtful that the United States 
will insist on such proposals at the risk of another round of 
the depreciation of the dollar. It is possible that the United 
States will compromise further on numerical targets at the 
sector-by-sector negotiations.

  [Text] U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has 
demanded that Japan fulfill its commitment to increase the 
number of dealers in foreign cars, an issue which was regarded 
as pending in the bilateral economic framework talks. 
Commenting on this, a negotiator for the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] criticized the demand as 
follows: 1) The Kantor demand goes against the Japan-U.S. 
accord to "rule out target figures"; and 2) each auto dealer is 
supposed to be free to make the decision whether or not to deal 
in foreign-made models, and the government must not intervene in 
their business affairs. 
  The MITI negotiator noted his concern over Kantor's remark, 
saying: "Even if the framework talks are resumed, the two 
nations may fall into the same dilemma." 
  The Japanese Government agrees on using the number of 
dealers 
in foreign cars as one of several "objective criteria" to 
evaluate the openness of the Japanese auto market. However, 
Japan says the criteria must be used to review present 
circumstances and past records, and Kantor's demand for "future 
commitment" is nothing but a demand for a numerical target. 
  In the bilateral accord on the resumption of the framework 
talks, a commitment on auto sales was drawn up on the same lines 
as one on the mobile phone market. 
  The MITI negotiator, however, said: "While the government 
does have control over access to the mobile phone market, auto 
sales is a liberal industrial field run by the business sector. 
The government exercises very different authority in each 
field." 
  The United States has been demanding that Japan honor its 
commitment to increase the number of dealers in foreign cars. 
Japanese negotiators feel Kantor's remarks indicated the United 
States has no intention of changing its negotiation policies 
even after the latest accord. 
  Some quarters in the government are voicing frustration with 
the bilateral accord on the resumption of framework talks, 
saying: "The accord was made hastily. Consequently it is 
inadequate and may be open to misinterpretation by the United 
States."

  [Text] On 27 May, a top Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry [MITI] official declared: "We will not promise 
numbers which are determined by market mechanisms." He made 
this remark in reference to the fact the numerical targets' 
definition is still not clear even though Japan and the United 
States have agreed not to include numerical targets as an 
objective criteria measure in the Japan-U.S. economic talks, 
which are due to resume soon. He said even when the United 
States asks for something that comes close to numerical targets 
-- like a growth rate measure --, Japan will reject it at the 
sector-by-sector talks. 
  Asked about the possibility that at the automobile and auto 
part talks, the United States might ask to set targets on the 
number of auto dealers, he said: "We cannot make any promise on 
something that is out of the government's reach."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Painful Choice Between Human Rights and Trade"] </F>
  [Text] The renewal of most-favored-nation (MFN) trade 
status for China has become an annual issue. This time 
President Clinton has, in effect, unconditionally extended MFN 
for China by announcing that his administration would in future 
remove the link between the renewal of MFN and China's human 
rights record. Has the Clinton administration shifted from its 
conventional policy of emphasizing the need for China to improve 
its human rights record to a policy of emphasizing the 
attractive Chinese market, which continues to grow at a high 
rate? The policy shift is the result of a painful choice made 
by the Clinton administration, which had previously conducted a 
form of human rights diplomacy toward China. 
  The original purpose of MFN for China was to provide it with 
trade and tariff privileges that are not disadvantageous 
compared to those granted to third nations. The United States 
has renewed MFN for China every year since it normalized 
relations. In the wake of the Tiananmen incident in 1989, U.S. 
Congress voted to renew MFN on condition China improved its 
human rights record, but President Bush vetoed the congressional 
decision. 
  The Clinton administration, which came to office after 
criticizing the Bush administration's China policy, has set a 
seven-point condition for the annual renewal of MFN. It 
includes, among other things, 1) the promotion of exit permits 
for Chinese and Beijing's observance of an agreement not to 
export prison-labor products. The Clinton administration 
asserted that MFN would not be extended next time unless the 
seven conditions are met. 
  In response, China has made a small concession to the U.S. 
demand by granting exit permits to a few democracy activists and 
allowing foreign human rights activists to visit Chinese 
prisons. China took democracy activists into custody in March 
when U.S. Secretary of State Christopher visited China. 
Attracted by China's bullish economy, however, European and 
Japanese corporations have rushed to the Chinese market and this 
has prompted China to keep taking a tough stand on human rights. 
  In the face of this, the U.S. business community has felt an 
increasing sense of crisis, saying: "If the situation were to 
continue, the United States would fall behind every other 
nation." Some Americans maintain that if MFN is not extended, it 
will be impossible to foster the Chinese middle classes who it 
is hoped will take charge of promoting democracy in China. 
  The Clinton administration had been sandwiched between human 
rights and trade. More important, China's cooperation is needed 
in dealing with the issue of North Korea's suspected development 
of nuclear weapons. The Clinton administration, therefore, has 
chosen to renew MFN in exchange for the "long-term improvement 
of human rights in China." It admits, though, that China's 
improvement in human rights is still inadequate. 
  For a long time doubts have been raised about the way the 
United States has linked the annual renewal of MFN to an 
improvement in China's human rights and rashly pressed China to 
choose between them. If MFN is not renewed, though, it would 
hurt both the United States and China. 
  It goes without saying that human rights are universal 
values 
and the direction the United States has taken deserves to be 
applauded. Human rights is closely related to culture and 
religion in certain nations and in certain regions. There is no 
other way but to be patient about improving human rights in 
Asia, and to try various policies. 
  On many occasions recently the United States has conducted 
its foreign policy toward Asian nations without full regard to 
their situations and imposed its self-assertion on them. In so 
doing, it has incurred a backlash. 
  To cite examples, the United States has been in dispute with 
Singapore over the caning of an American youth, and members of 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have reacted 
to the U.S. policy of linking labor and trade issues. This 
criticism is voiced within the Clinton administration against 
its own Asia policy. 
  The United States has switched its way of conducting human 
rights diplomacy to a realistic way. If it were now to begin 
making a sweeping review of its Asia policy, this would start to 
improve relations between the United States and Asian nations. 
  On the other hand, China must not think that because the 
Clinton administration has decided to renew MFN, the human 
rights issue in China is now settled. Under the surface of 
economic hypergrowth, human rights in China are placed under 
severe restrictions. It is understandable that if living 
standards improve in China, the Chinese people will make 
political requests compatible with their improved living 
standards. To date, though, little headway has been made in 
political democratization. 
  How will China improve its human rights, by the application 
of "external pressure" or by its own initiative? This question 
has everything to do with the future of China.

  [Text] Both the Japanese and Russian Governments, which 
have been discussing measures to prevent Moscow from resuming 
dumping of radioactive waste into the sea, have agreed to 
dispose of radioactive waste by constructing small facilities 
which float on the water. The design is currently being worked 
out. Construction is expected to begin this summer and be 
finished early next year. Since the Russian Government has 
pledged "not to resume dumping into waters earlier than the 
facilities are completed," radioactive waste dumping into the 
Sea of Japan will be avoided for the time being if the plan 
proceeds smoothly. 
  Russia has asked Japan to help construct such facilities. 
The two governments have been coordinating details of the plan. 
  The facilities will be constructed in a harbor in the 
suburbs 
of Vladivostok, and they are capable of storing approximately 
800 tons of radioactive waste. Three tanks -- for storing, 
processing, and solidifying radioactive waste -- will be 
installed on a ship, and the waste will be put in drums. 
Construction costs are expected to reach $20 or $30 million and 
will be covered by Japan's $100-million program for assisting 
the denuclearization of the former Soviet Union. This plan is 
regarded as an emergency measure to prevent dumping of 
radioactive waste into the sea.

  [Text] During the 27 May session of the lower house budget 
committee Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, touching on the issue of 
how Japan would cope if an emergency developed over the DPRK's 
(North Korea's) nuclear ambitions, said: "Generally speaking, 
the government will take adequate measures." 
  At the same session Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa referred 
to the government's preparatory work for emergency legislation 
to join possible sanctions against North Korea. 
  Kakizawa said: "Each section concerned is studying all 
possibilities, including legislative measures." 
  The two senior government members made their remarks in 
reply 
to questions by Representative Nobutaka Machimura (of the 
Liberal Democratic Party). 
  Responding to a question asking what Japan would do if 
multinational forces were organized over the North Korean issue 
in addition to any UN actions, Kakizawa said the government's 
policy would be to offer all possible cooperation. 
  "It would be difficult for Japan in various ways, but Japan 
must do everything it can," he said. 
  When Hata was asked about future direction of Japan's 
defense 
buildup policy, he said: "While some positive signs have been 
seen since the end of the Cold War, Japan is still surrounded by 
regional tensions. We must map out future policies taking these 
into account." 
  Hata said he would make a careful decision on a revision of 
the "National Defense Program Outline" in view of the debates at 
the advisory Defense Issues Council. 
  He said: "We are not presupposing troop reduction [of the 
Self- Defense Forces]. Rather, we must determine our future 
course of action by paying sufficient attention to present 
circumstances."

  [Text] On the morning of 30 May, the Budget Committee of 
the House of Representatives continued its comprehensive 
interpellations on the fiscal 1994 draft budget. At this 
session, Yoshio Hachiro (of the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ]) raised the question of how the government intended to 
deal with the breach between the DPRK [Democratic Poeple's 
Republic of Korea] and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) on consultaions on the nuclear inspection issue. 
  In reply, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa stated: "They are 
engaged in extracting fuel rods from the five-megawatt 
experimental nuclear reactor. If this operation should 
continue, it would become -- within two or three days -- 
difficult to carry out further inspection. And we are concerned 
about this." 
  His comments indicated that the government is seriously 
concerned about the situation. 
  He added: "We have made proposals in various forms to North 
Korea, asking for its sincere handling of the issue. And to 
carry out further inspection, consultations are being held 
between the United States and the DPRK, between Japan, the 
United States, and the ROK, and also with China." 
  His remarks disclosed the fact that consultations are 
currently being held on the issue among various countries.

  [Text] A senior Japanese Foreign Ministry official 
disclosed on 28 May that the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea] plans to carry out missile test launches over the Sea 
of Japan in a few days. 
  This information is the result of the analysis of data 
provided by the United States. He said, "Preparations for the 
experiment are under way. We have concluded that it will be 
carried out in the immediate future." 
  The Japanese Government was able to confirm the test 
launches 
of the DPRK's "Nodong-1" ballistic missile in May 1993. It 
believes that the missile to be tested this time will be 
slightly bigger and that it will have a greater range.

  [Text] The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] plans 
to send a delegation of its Diet members to North Korea in June. 
This was revealed by SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo in an 
interview with SANKEI SHIMBUN on 25 May. If the plan is 
realized, the party will ask North Korea to refrain from 
engaging in its alleged nuclear arms development program. It 
will also call for resumption of talks on normalizing Japan-DPRK 
relations. 
  Although the SDPJ has been on friendly terms with the 
Workers 
Party of Korea, it has stopped sending formal delegations since 
last August when it joined the coalition as a member of the 
former Hosokawa administration. But since the SPDJ bolted the 
coalition and "there are no more restrictions as a ruling party" 
(according to a SDPJ official), the SDPJ is now holding informal 
negotiations with North Korea on a plan to send a delegation led 
by Secretary General Kubo as soon as meetings with President 
Kim Il-song and other leaders are arranged.

<F P=106> [Article by Hiroshi Hasegawa, AERA Editorial Department </F>
reporter: "The Japanese Government's Top Secret Scenario To Cope 
With Emergency on the Korean Peninsula"; first paragraph is AERA 
introduction] 
  If North and South Korea start a war on the Korean 
peninsula after the United Nations imposes economic sanctions 
against North Korea which is suspected of developing nuclear 
weapons, how will Japan cope with the war? AERA has obtained a 
document that reveals a package of measures under secret 
examination by the Japanese Government. 
  The outline of the package of measures to prepare for a 
state 
of emergency on the Korean peninsula, which the Japanese 
Government is now secretly examining, has come to light. 
  If the United Nations imposes economic sanctions against 
North Korea, how will the Japanese Government deal with them?" 
If a war breaks out, how will Japan cooperate with U.S. Forces? 
AERA has obtained the document revealing how relevant 
ministries and agencies are now working on to map out the 
package of measures. (Refer to tables on pages 14 and 15.) 
  Commenting on the package of measures, a cabinet Secretariat 
official has said, "As Japan's measures to deal with 
international crisis, the package of measures is the largest in 
scale since Japan was defeated in World War II." Relevant 
ministries and agencies have recently briefed the Foreign 
Affairs Division of each ruling coalition party on the package 
of measures. The top government leader is aware of the package 
of measures. 
  The document lists all areas where Japan cannot cope with 
the 
emergency under laws and ordinances currently in force and 
clearly indicates what sort of legislation is required to cope 
with the emergency. 
  North Korea is promoting its nuclear program in Yongbyon, 90 
km north of Pyongyang, and it appears to be expanding 
underground facilities. The International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) has been trying to check North Korea's nuclear facilities 
in accordance with a safeguards agreement concluded between the 
IAEA and North Korea as required by the nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, but North Korea is still refusing to 
permit IAEA-sought inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
  The United States has intervened in the standoff between 
North Korea and the IAEA in an effort to alter North Korea's 
attitude through dialogue. However, North Korea has triggered 
the war of nerves instead by using its nuclear card, and the "on 
and off" negotiations have continued for more than two years. 
Some have therefore begun arguing for economic sanctions by the 
UN Security Council and non-UN economic sanctions imposed by 
such concerned nations as Japan, the United States, and South 
Korea. 
<H5>  Japan Bans Remittances, Trade, and Exchange of Visits With </H5>
North Korea 
  Under this situation, North Korea has been developing the 
Nodong-1 missile capable of hitting any part of Japan. Last 
year, it test-fired the missile into the Sea of Japan. Its 
leadership has continued its criticism of Japan. 
  Meanwhile, during his meeting with then Prime Minister 
Hosokawa last November, President Clinton reportedly took the 
issue of continued illegal outflow of huge sums of the yen from 
Japan to North Korea. 
  According to the same cabinet Secretariat official, the 
Japanese Government is prepared to enforce economic sanctions by 
establishing a countermeasure headquarter two or three days 
after the UN Security Council votes to impose economic sanctions 
against North Korea. 
  So far, the government and the ruling coalition parties are 
working on details of the package on the assumption of four 
situations: 1) Japan's cooperation on economic sanctions 
imposed by the UN Security Council; 2) Japan's assistance to the 
U.S. forces when the United States and South Korea go into a 
state of war with North Korea; 3) Japan's transport of refugees; 
and 4) Japan's defensive actions or "Japan's self-defense war" 
in accordance with Article 76 of the Self-Defense Forces Law. 
The private views of officials who have been involved in 
compiling the document are incorporated in the tables. 
  It is legally possible for Japan to ban or restrict the 
remittance and investment by ethnic Koreans residing in Japan to 
North Korea; Trade; and the exchange of visits by ships, 
aircraft, and personnel between Japan and North Korea, but there 
is a possibility that the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan [Chongnyon] will strongly react against such 
measures. Nonetheless, the Japanese Government will be able to 
put the measures into effect whenever the top government leader 
makes a decision on them. 
  It is still difficult for the Japanese Government to draw a 
conclusion on how to deal with reentry into Japan by ethnic 
Koreans residing in Japan after their short visits to their 
relatives in North Korea. 
  If the Korean residents residing in Japan are banned from 
returning to Japan where they have their base of livelihood, 
Japan would be criticized from the humanitarian point of view. 
  What is impossible or difficult under laws and ordinances 
currently in force are the activities of the Self-Defense Forces 
[SDF] to back up the economic sanctions and Japan's assistance 
to the U.S. forces engaged in combat. 
  The same Cabinet Secretariat official has explained as 
follows on the basis of the tables:

<H5>  Japan Is Country Involved Unlike Gulf War </H5>
  Naval Interception and Check of Ships -- Even if 
it becomes necessary to undertake surveillance activities in 
certain sea areas in order to keep ships from breaching the 
economic sanctions, the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] cannot carry 
out such activities under the Self-Defense Forces Law. The SDF 
cannot carry out these activities in either open sea or Japan's 
territorial waters. 
  As a result, the argument is surfacing on the need to amend 
the SDF Law. If the SDF undertakes naval interception and check 
of ships near sea waters where North Korea wages sea battles 
with the United States and South Korea, it would be dragged into 
the sea battles. 
  The amendment to the SDF Law may breach the Constitution 
depending on how the SDF Law is amended. Unlike the Gulf war, 
for which Japan made financial and material contributions, and 
the peacekeeping operations (PKO) in Cambodia, for which it sent 
its units, Japan would be a country involved directly in the 
emergency on the Korean peninsula. 
  Japan will choose between letting the SDF carry out 
activities as it is or organizing a PKO unit. It also will 
decide whether to refrain from taking part in activities outside 
Japan while joining the economic sanctions. It will not adopt an 
attitude of indifference toward the emergency. 
  Laying of Mines in the Sea -- Under current law, 
the SDF can participate in removing mines from the sea if it is 
not known which country laid the mines. 
  If the SDF is to remove the mines laid in foreign 
territorial 
waters for amphibious landing operations, it must amend the SDF 
Law. It is hard to see the SDF's removal of mines as a 
self-defense act and the SDF's involvement in the removal of 
mines will most likely be seen as an act breaching the 
Constitution. 
  A minesweeper of the Maritime Self-Defense Force was sent to 
the Persian Gulf only after the Gulf war ended.

  Rescue of Refugees -- As long as the current 
law does not allow the dispatch of SDF troops overseas, the 
government cannot use the SDF even for humanitarian purposes, 
such as the rescue of refugees. Bills to allow the dispatch of 
SDF airplanes overseas have been submitted to the Diet, and the 
dispatch of war vessels also has been discussed. But the 
prospect of these bills becoming law is dim. 
<H5>  Government Is Studying Mobilization of SDF in an Emergency </H5>
  Legislation for Emergency Cases -- Besides the 
review of the SDF Law, the revision of relevant laws and 
ordinances, as well as the enactment of new laws, will be taken 
up for discussion. 
  For example, when the government urgently needs to construct 
a surveillance facility somewhere, it has to obtain landowners' 
consent if the place is a private forest. Whether or not 
legislation to allow emergency land expropriation is necessary 
to save the government the trouble of obtaining such consent 
will likely be discussed. 
  A noticeable point in the government's study of the DPRK 
issue is the inclusion among subjects for detailed study of 
Articles 76 and 77 of the SDF Law, which stipulate ordering the 
mobilization of SDF troops and standby for mobilization. 
  The study of these articles is aimed at clarifying 
conditions 
under which Japan can wage a "defensive war." 
  Although the current law allows the government to expose tax 
evasion by Korean residents in Japan, to do so will unexpectedly 
be difficult for the government. 
  According to the (1991 issue of) Chongnyon, a 
brochure published by the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan [Chongnyon], the Commercial and Industrial 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan, a Chongnyon-affiliated 
organ, reached a five-point agreement with the National Tax 
Administration Agency 18 years ago. The first point stipulates 
that "all issues concerning Korean businessmen's taxes should be 
resolved through consultation with the Commercial and Industrial 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan." 
  Is there any connection between "tax evasion" by Korean 
residents in Japan, which the government plans to expose when 
sanctions are imposed on North Korea, and this agreement? 
<H5>  Money Flow, Tax Evasion Will Also Be Targets of Economic </H5>
Sanctions 
  Moreover, what is the connection between the flow of money 
from Japan to the DPRK, which the United States is also closely 
watching, and "tax evasion" in Japan? The National Tax 
Administration Agency has so far denied the existence of the 
five-point agreement. But when sanctions are imposed on the 
DPRK, the agency will need to disclose the facts about the 
agreement so it can expose tax evasion in a fair manner. 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata has seldom told about specific 
measures to cope with possible Korea crisis since his term as 
foreign minister. 
  But at a House of Representatives' Budget Committee session 
on 24 May, he made remarks suggesting the possibility of Japan 
engaging in activities other than those to be carried out under 
a UN resolution. His remarks indicated that the government is 
steadily promoting the study of measures to deal with an 
emergency case.

<F P=106> [Article by AERA editorial staffer Shunji Taoka: "If a </F>
Special Demolition Force Attacks Japan, the Self-Defense Forces 
Will Be Mobilized To Defend the Nation"] 
  [Text] The government is currently studying measures to 
deal with the issue of DPRK's suspected nuclear development 
program. Among these measures, those concerning the timing and 
necessary conditions for ordering "the mobilization of troops 
for defense [boei-shutsudo]" are most noticeable. 
  North Korea has a special force composed of about 
60,000-100,000 troops, of which 2,000 allegedly specialize in 
infiltration and subversive activities. 
  It has been argued that if the U.S. Forces make a bombing 
raid on North Korea from Japan in the case of a contingency, 
some of these specially trained soldiers might infiltrate Japan 
with the aim of blowing up or attacking nuclear power plants, 
Shinkansen bullet train lines, airports, military bases, and 
government offices. 
  However, if they take off their coats and show uniforms of 
the Korean People's Army just before they attack, Japan has to 
treat them as prisoners in some cases in line with international 
law. 
  The prime minister can order mobilization for defense "when 
Japan is attacked by a foreign country" and "when there are 
signs of armed attack against Japan." But as a rule, he needs 
to obtain a prior Diet approval. In an emergency, he is allowed 
to obtain the approval immediately after ordering mobilization 
for defense. Without the order for mobilization for defense, 
the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] cannot take defensive actions 
outside bases. In this case, police carry out defense duties. 
But it is impossible for police officers to fight against 
specially trained soldiers just with guns and billy clubs. 
  This is the reason that the government stresses the need for 
studying mobilization for defense in its documents on the DPRK 
issue. Once mobilization for defense is ordered, Japan makes 
combat preparations. The SDF is allowed to use force. 
Meanwhile, the Defense Agency [DA] is authorized to control 
private hospitals and clinics through prefectural governors, 
expropriate land and houses, and give orders to people busy in 
medicare, construction, and transport. 
  The SDF can also take over duties from police to maintain 
public law and order. The Maritime Safety Agency falls under 
the control of the DA director general. Local governments, 
police, and fire fighters are obliged to cooperate with the SDF. 
Procedures for wartime preparations and compensations will be 
stipulated by government ordinances, which the government is 
scheduled to issue when an emergency occurs. 
  The phrase "when there are signs of armed attack against 
Japan" does not mean if there is the least probability of 
attack, but means when there is high probability. This is the 
interpretation of this phrase. However, it is difficult to know 
the movements of a foreign special force. If the DA asserts 
"various kinds of information show a high probability of 
attack," the Diet will not be able to rebut it. 
  Some DA officials note that because the actions of special 
forces are tantamount to criminal acts, the mobilization of 
troops to maintain public peace and order [shian-shutsudo] is 
more appropriate than mobilization for defense. 
  However, shian-shutsudo is ordered by governors and does not 
require a Diet approval. Thus, it is feared that in a tense 
situation, shian-shutsudo might be ordered easily.

  [Text] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], which had boasted 
of its cohesiveness, is now in disarray after former Economic 
Planning Agency Director General Koichiro Aino, who as director 
of the Committee on Rules and Administration of the House of 
Representatives, on 19 May criticized Shinseito Secretary 
General Ichiro Ozawa in his article in a weekly journal; the 
"Cold War" relationship between Keiwa Okuda, chairman of the 
Committee on Rules and Administration of the House of 
Representatives, and Mr. Ozawa has surfaced. Other parties have 
continued their criticism of "the relationship between Ozawa and 
Yuichi Ichikawa" who is secretary general of the Komeito [Clean 
Government Party], and now some Shinseito members are 
criticizing Ozawa as "too self-righteous." 
<H5>  Uproar Over Dismissal </H5>
  Hajime Funada, secretary in charge of policy affairs for 
Shinseito, notified Aino of his dismissal as director of the 
Committee on Rules and Administration. His dismissal, however, 
was decided as part of a series of shakeups in Shinseito two 
weeks ago. Mr. Ozawa was discontent with the way that both Okuda 
and Aino, who attached importance to cooperation with opposition 
parties, ran the Diet. Kozo Watanabe, acting secretary general 
of Shinseito, did not notify Okuda of Aino's dismissal out of 
consideration for Okuda. Kozo Watanabe did not let Okuda know 
about the dismissal of Aino, who is known to have been "Mr. 
Okuda's protege for 17 years," for fear of intensifying the 
rivalry between Ozawa and Okuda. 
  In his article in the weekly journal, Aino accused Ozawa of 
forming the parliamentary group "Kaishin" and claimed that its 
formation was "Mr. Ozawa's mistake" that resulted in the 
minority government. Aino, who is strongly reacting against his 
dismissal, is claiming Ozawa dismissed him in retaliation for 
his criticism of Ozawa. Aino is increasingly making critical 
comments about Ozawa, saying: "It is not permissible to send Mr. 
Funada to me to notify me of my dismissal. Mr. Funada was a 
junior legislator just like my younger brother when we belonged 
to the Takeshita faction." Junior legislators in Shinseito are 
siding with Aino, asking, "What is wrong with speaking of Mr. 
Ozawa's mistake?" 
Party Reform [subhead] 
  Shinseito was been able to overcome the crisis arising from 
Aino's dismissal after Kozo Watanabe and Toshihiro Nikkai, 
secretary in charge of general affairs, succeeded in calming 
Okuda. Aino nonetheless is stressing the need to reform the way 
that Shinseito is run under Mr. Ozawa's top-down style, saying, 
"It is necessary to promote intraparty communication." Some 
junior lawmakers are arguing: "The secretary general of our 
party holds the exclusive right to manage our party's personnel 
affairs. If our party were run by a bottom-up style, it would be 
unable to deal with this uncertain political situation." 
Explaining what Ozawa thinks, a senior lawmaker in Shinseito 
says: "Mr. Ozawa has always made decisions with all things taken 
into consideration. He has managed our party's personnel affairs 
with potential media criticism taken into account. It is 
regrettable that nobody understands the way he gets things done." 
  A senior legislator in Shinseito says, "We support Mr. 's 
reformist policies, but all things have not gone the way Mr. 
Ozawa hoped." Whether or not Ozawa is able to reform Shinseito 
while listening to intraparty opinions is likely to determine 
the future of Shinseito.

  [Text] Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the Democratic Socialist

which he commented on the "Kaishin" parliamentary group in the 
House of Representatives, the formation of which triggered the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan's secession from the coalition 
government. He said, "While this group is being criticized, from 
a long-term point of view, it will prove to be useful (for the 
realignment of the political world)." He thus stressed the 
significance of the group's formation. 
  Ouchi held an informal meeting with reporters after the 
speech. Asked about demands inside the DSP and from labor unions 
supporting DSP for his resignation as chairman, Ouchi said, "I 
will have to reach a conclusion before the party convention (to 
be held on 7 and 8 June)."

assistant political editor; place and date not given] 
  Cabinet Resignation En Masse or Diet Dissolution? [subhead] 
  [Takahashi] Some people are predicting that either the Diet 
will be dissolved for a general election or that the cabinet 
will resign en masse once the budget bills are passed. 
  [Watanabe] We would sincerely like to call on the SDPJ and 
Sakigake to return to the original spirit which aspired to 
create a new political order in this nation. 
  [Kanzaki] We must not let a political vacuum occur. We must 
do all the things that need to be done. As far as political 
reform is concerned, we must finish it, and pass the bill on 
electoral district zoning. After all this is done, if there is 
a demand that the public pass judgment on the government, then 
let there be judgment. 
  [Takahashi] What is the view of the SDPJ? 
  [Kubo] For the coalition government to solidify its base, we 
must think about forming a third coalition government after 
enabling the second coalition government to fulfill its mission 
at the earliest date. I am not talking about the logic of 
numbers, but I am saying that if there are confrontations over 
constitutional, or important policy matters, we can submit a 
motion of no-confidence in the cabinet. If we decide to present 
a motion of no-confidence, we should do so only after 
considering what kind of government should replace the Hata 
administration. It would be too irresponsible to do otherwise. 
We would like to arrive at a decision on the question in the 
course of deliberations in the Diet. 
  If a motion of no-confidence is passed, as a matter of 
principle in constitutional government, power should first be 
passed to the largest opposition party. The question is whether 
we want that now. I think the Hata government should think about 
moving out voluntarily and about what it should do to build the 
next coalition government. Once a motion of no-confidence is 
passed, it cannot do that. 
  [Watanabe] Prime Minister Hata is considering General 
Secretary Kubo's idea as a possible option. The possibility of 
the cabinet resigning en masse is not completely zero. The SDPJ 
and the Sakigake voted for Tsutomu Hata as prime minister; they 
should recognize the importance of that action. 
  [Sonoda] The cabinet has already begun work, we should not 
pass a motion of no-confidence in it. It is true, though, that 
the coalition is a minority government and there is no doubt the 
issue will be raised sooner or later. 
  [Yonezawa] The 1994 budget bill and budget-related bills are 
still in the process of being deliberated. As a result, actions 
on other important government matters are being delayed. It is 
no time to create a political vacuum. A motion of no-confidence 
will not pass unless the LDP and the SDPJ collaborate. But I 
wonder if either party would accept such an arrangement. No one 
should talk about holding the next general election under the 
multiseat electoral district system. If a politically difficult 
situation arises and a general election must be held, it should 
be held under a single-seat district system (which combines a 
proportional representation system). Conducting an election 
under the multiseat district system will mean destroying 
political reform altogether. Suppose a no-confidence motion is 
passed. Political chaos will worsen unless we have arrived at 
agreement on what kind of government we should have next. 
  [Matsuoka] We do not hear anyone in our constituencies 
calling for dissolution of the Diet. Instead, many say 
political reform should be completed and the coalition should 
once again persist. The way to meet the expectations of the 
people on political reform is to hold an election and form a new 
coalition government under the new single-seat district system. 
I have to say that any other course of action will kill 
political reform. 
  [Takahashi] What are the chances of Mr. Hata resigning 
voluntarily and returning to the post of prime minister in a new 
cabinet? 
  [Kubo] If he resigns in order to stabilize the base of the 
coalition government, all heads of the parties participating in 
the new coalition will be qualified to be appointed prime 
minister -- Mr. Hata included. 
  [Kanzaki] I welcome Mr. Kubo's view. 
  [Takahashi] Can you share government power with Mr. Ichiro 
Ozawa (general secretary of Shinseito). 
  [Kubo] I worked with him for half a year. There were things 
I learned from him, but there were also points where I could not 
agree with him. But we can cooperate with each other on the 
major issues which Japanese politicians must tackle. I do not 
think the problem with Mr. Ozawa is such a great obstacle. 
  [Takahashi] Does SDPJ Chairman Murayama think the same way? 
  [Kubo] There are no differences of view between myself and 
the chairman. The chairman said: "If the government comes to a 
dead end and there is no choice but to dissolve the Diet and 
hold a general election, then we should ask for the public's 
judgment by holding the election." I, too, think that if there 
is no other choice, that is what we should do. 
  On the other hand, if a no-confidence motion is passed but 
the coalition does not want a general election under the 
multiseat district system, then the only choice left is 
resignation of the cabinet en masse, which would be tantamount 
to giving up on the coalition. What I am saying is, the 
coalition should not wait for a no-confidence motion to be 
filed, but should choose its own way of stabilizing its 
government base. 
  [Takahashi] Will the SDPJ come back to the existing 
coalition government if a new agreement was reached on basic 
policies? 
  [Kubo] It would be extremely difficult for the party to 
return to the present government. The SDPJ will, by all means, 
seek ways to form a new coalition government -- a third 
coalition government. 
  [Takahashi] Will the LDP pursue its plan to get the Diet 
dissolved in preparation for a general election? 
  [Mori] The SDPJ bolted the coalition government late in the 
evening of 25 April, the day Hata was appointed prime minister. 
The prime minister, in principle, should have resigned then. 
Besides which, it is former Prime Minister Hosokawa and 
then-Deputy Prime Minister Hata who should be held responsible 
for having delayed action on the budget bill in order to get the 
reform bills passed first. Once the budget bill is passed, his 
duties expire. We have never said anything about a motion of 
no-confidence in the cabinet nor on the dissolution of the Diet. 
At issue is what Prime Minister Hata decides to do once the 
budget bill is passed. The people are angry about the reins of 
government being passed over from one group to another by 
prearrangement. The people want another general election. If 
there is an election, there would be no choice but to hold it 
under the current (multiseat district) system. If that is 
considered an "act of crushing political reform," then all the 
parties should get together and agree on some kind of action to 
prevent it. 
  [Watanabe] No doubt it is desirable that the budget for a 
year should be formulated before the end of the preceding year. 
But in December last year, it was the prevailing view of the 
Diet and the public that the political reform-related bills 
should be passed before anything else. As a result, the 
formulation of the budget got delayed. It is not the case that 
certain people delayed the formulation of the bill. It means 
the coalition parties gave priority to political reform. 
Consequently, the third supplementary budget was formulated, 
and is being used in the April-May period. As long as the 1994 
budget bill is passed by the lower house by 1 June, there should 
be no adverse impact on the economy. 
  [Mori] We are doing everything we can to have the bill 
passed without delay. We are irritated because there is no word 
from the ruling parties on "when it should be finished." I am 
happy that you have formally given us a date of "1 June." Why 
did you not say that earlier? 
  [Watanabe] Because I might have got scolded if I did. 
[laughter] 
  [Takahashi] Will the next general election be conducted 
under the current multiseat district system or under the new 
system? 
  [Watanabe] The common view of the parties is that the next 
election should be held under the single-seat district system. 
But if an unjustifiable no-confidence motion is introduced and 
passed, it is possible the election will be conducted under the 
current multiseat district system. 
  [Kanzaki] As long as the zoning of the electoral districts 
remains uncompleted, there is no way to toughen up provisions on 
penalties [for infractions of election law violations] or 
reforming the political funds system. Some say the election can 
held under the current system if the parties can agree that 
elections thereafter will be held under the new election system. 
But I must note that about one third of incumbent Diet members 
normally would lose their seats in each election and that the 
agreement cannot bind newly elected Diet members. 
  [Kubo] The SDPJ is not saying the election must be carried 
out under the current multiseat district system. We are saying 
there is no choice but to hold the election under the multiseat 
system if attempts to find a political breakthrough fall through 
and dissolution of the Diet is the only answer. If that 
happens, I must warn that the political reform bills should be 
not used as a green card [preceding two words in English] to get 
around the problem. 
  [Yonezawa] We can foresee a situation in which an election 
must be held because the political situation has come to a dead 
end. But this depends on what the opposition parties decide to 
do. I hope they will wait until the election can be held under 
the single-seat district system. 
  [Mori] You must not try to constrain the Dietmen's right to 
dissolve the Diet. People talk about the possibility of the LDP 
and the SDPJ cooperating. Prime Minister Hata should think 
about it so this kind of situation does not arise. 
  [Matsuoka] I think the causes of political corruption in the 
past have been in the election system itself. We should make 
sure the government is able to put the finishing touches to 
reform. I hope we can agree to maintain the administration 
until an election under the single-seat system is possible. 
  [Sonoda] If you think about the future, you will come to see 
the need to complete work on the single-seat district system. 
No doubt, the single-seat system will make elections more 
party-oriented than the multiseat system. Voters, though, want 
an election system that enables them to picture a certain 
framework of government and make a choice based on that. For 
that reason alone the single-seat district system is preferable 
and the election should be conducted under it. 
<H5>  Will LDP-SDPJ Collaboration Be Possible? </H5>
  [Takahashi] Do you see the LDP and the SDPJ collaborating 
with each other? 
  [Mori] The times we live in are such that this is a 
possibility. The political world will remain paralyzed if the 
present coalition continues. As long as the political form 
widely known as dual structural power continues, the Japanese 
political world will remain an anomaly. Both our party and the 
SDPJ are endeavoring to change this. That does not mean, 
though, we are collaborating particularly closely. 
  Both parties have their own routes for climbing toward the 
goal. When they come to the final point of the climb, they might 
have to talk to each other. But the SDPJ could reject our offer 
at such a time. 
  [Kubo] With progress being made on political reform and 
political realignment, I think the walls between political 
parties and between ruling and opposition parties will become 
lower. In that context, active cooperation with the LDP for the 
purpose of defending parliamentary democracy is possible. If 
there are common policy issues, they will find it necessary to 
cooperate. On such important political issues as a 
no-confidence motion, conclusions will be reached after the two 
parties have fully briefed each other on their respective 
positions. But just because we left the coalition parties, it 
does not automatically mean we have formed a coalition 
opposition force. 
  [Watanabe] I would like to ask both Mr. Kubo and Mr. Sonoda 
if your two parties will stay in the position of being neither 
ruling nor opposition parties. I will ask Mr. Hata, for his 
part, to do some soul-searching, but I hope your parties will 
return to the ruling parties without further delay. 
  [Sonoda] Our party did not leave because we felt mistreated. 
  [Takahashi] Which way do you think reorganization of the 
olitical world will move? 
  [Yonezawa] Once the elections begin to be conducted under 
the single-seat district system, the political forces will 
probably gather around two axes. Forces with policies of a 
certain similarity will get together around these axes and come 
to share government power together. 
  [Sonoda] The idea of the "LDP against the non-LDP forces" is 
not our ultimate goal. I think we should consolidate forces 
within certain frameworks. 
  [Kubo] Whether it be under a bi-polar or tri-polar system, 
the era of the coalition -- the condition of the government 
changing hands from one coalition to another -- will continue. 
Perhaps the age of the "tri-polar" system will last 
considerably longer. Only after we have experienced coalition 
governments of various compositions, will we probably head 
toward a two-party system. 
  [Mori] As far as local organizations are concerned, too 
hasty a political realignment is undesirable. We should not be 
too rash. A problem with the existing coalition is that it wants 
to get to a bi-polar system too fast. When the new election 
system comes into being, the shuffling of Diet members will take 
place at a considerably faster tempo. A stable two-party system 
is desirable, though as long as proportional representation 
remains part of the election system, I think stability is 
impossible. I think we should head for a simple single-seat 
district system eventually. 
  [Watanabe] Under the single-seat system, as far as local 
areas are concerned, the LDP definitely has advantages. Unless 
smaller parties find a way of joining their forces together, the 
elections will be meaningless. We selected the single-seat 
system as the appropriate way of proceeding toward a two-party 
system. I think eventually we will get there. 
  [Yonezawa] There was a time (immediately after the Hosokawa 
government started) when being the "non-LDP" force was 
justification enough when it came to getting things done. But I 
think we no longer live in that time. Unless we can pursue our 
goals by sharing policies and ideals, we will be called simple 
collections to get ourselves elected to Diet. 
<H5>  Evaluation of the Hata Government </H5>
  [Takahashi] What is your view on the minority Hata 
government? 
  [Watanabe] The government set sail under very difficult 
conditions. But Mr. Hata is in the process of accomplishing 
things, one after another, that meet the expectations of the 
public. His biggest responsibility is to pass the budget and 
related bills as soon as possible. The SDPJ and the Sakigake 
have promised to "cooperate on the passage of budget and 
budget-related bills." The LDP, too, said it appreciates the 
importance of passing the budget bill. 
  On top of that, we would like to be able to at least make a 
forecast of the future of political and tax reform. 
  [Kanzaki] For the Japan of today, regardless of which party 
takes over government, things will be difficult. The Hata 
government may be a minority government, but it is doing all it 
can to tackle the issue of reform, and the public's appreciation 
for it's efforts is shown in an approval rate of more than 50 
percent in all kinds of public opinion polls. 
  [Matsuoka] At the start of the second coalition government, 
we all agreed that we should hold more in-depth talks with each 
other in order to make better use of the experiences of the 
first coalition government, but this action led to the departure 
of the SDPJ from the coalition. We must rethink the framework 
(of the coalition) with the understanding of the SDPJ. 
  [Yonezawa] Economic reform, administrative reform, and 
political reform are common tasks for all ruling and opposition 
parties. As long as the Hata government seeks earnestly to get 
the agreement of ruling and opposition parties on reform in 
these three areas, opposition parties to show it some 
understanding. And we will make every effort to help the SDPJ 
and Sakigake return to the coalition. 
  [Kubo] We would like to do our best in getting the budget 
and related bills passed. But we regret irregular statements 
made by cabinet members in reference to emergency laws and 
collective security, which seem to suggest a change in the 
thinking of the government. We strictly warn against such 
remarks. 
  [Sonoda] We are in the peculiar position of supporting the 
cabinet from outside the cabinet. But there is no question that 
we are outside the coalition camp. We will do our best to 
cooperate in running the Diet and getting the [budget-related] 
bills passed. But what happens after that will be something 
very different. Various problems will arise and the Hata 
government will have to face up to them. 
  [Mori] In two aspects, the Hata government does not conform 
to the basics of parliamentary democracy. First, it does not 
reflect the public will. Second, when the Hosokawa coalition 
government collapsed, power should have been handed over to the 
LDP, which is the major opposition party. But the reins of 
government were handed over to another coalition by 
prearrangement. I think we must create a political structure 
which accurately reflects the public will.

  [Text] Nine general trading companies announced their 
fiscal 1994 March settlement of accounts on 19 May, but they 
were settlement of accounts which showed a strong coloring of 
bubble-era disposition. Ordinary profit for the nine companies 
decreased 21 percent, the first decrease for three consecutive 
terms since the war. With the prolonged sluggish economy, major 
divisions such as machinery have had a hard fight, and a decline 
in sales due to the high yen has had an effect. With the drop in 
interest, the financial balance has improved, but it has not 
been able to compensate for the drop in regular business. The 
major trading companies have depreciated a large amount of bad 
assets across the board. The period ending in March 1995 will 
also have a grim business environment and there is a great 
probability that there will be no more than a weak profit. 
  Sales for the nine companies in the previous term were about 
103 trillion yen, a decrease of about 7 percent. The erosion of 
sales due to the high yen amounted to 1 trillion yen for 
Mitsubishi Corp. and 860 billion yen for Sumitomo Corp.; Mitsui 
&amp; Co. increased its precious metal dealings and was the only 
one 
to have higher earnings. 
  Gross sales profits were down for all companies, decreasing 
6 
percent, a total of 1,434.7 billion yen, for the nine companies. 
With the drop in interest, Mitsubishi Corp. at 7.1 billion yen 
and Mitsui &amp; Co. at 4 billion yen turned to a financial 
surplus, 
and Marubeni and Itohchu also reduced their deficit margin. 
However, the slump in regular business has had an effect and 
ordinary profits decreased in seven companies. Since the heavy 
electrical and plant division exports for Asia have progressed 
steadily, Marubeni has had an increase in ordinary profits on a 
real basis except for stock sales profits, and Tomen had a 
slight decrease in profits on a real basis. 
  The scale for depreciation of bad assets reached the highest 
level in the past for all such as Mitsubishi Corp., Itohchu, and 
Marubeni. In particular, they are hastening the liquidation of 
the financial engineering that expanded in the bubble era, and 
specified money trusts [tokkin] and fund trust balances that 
embrace latent losses have become half that of a year ago at a 
little over 600 billion yen in the nine company total. The move 
to dispose of unprofitable group companies at home and abroad 
also has been conspicuous. 
  They have squeezed out stock and real estate sales profits, 
but aftertax profits of the various companies have been greatly 
reduced, and Mitsubishi Corp. and others have disposed of 
internal reserves to maintain dividends. 
  As a result of full-scale depreciation of bad assets, it has 
been emphasized by various companies that "the operating burden 
has been alleviated" (Tetsuro Kitaoka, Marubeni director) and 
"we are approaching healthiness, and a system to undertake new 
commercial right acquisitions is ready" (Tetsuo Uemura, 
Mitsubishi Corp. director). 
  The various companies are anticipating an economic recovery 
this term from the second term, but it seems that it is possible 
that the nine-company total for ordinary profits will decline 
for four consecutive terms if the recovery scenario breaks down.

  [Text] Nippon Seiki has started to move into development of 
the instruments business in China, further increasing the 
overseas production ratio of the company. Along with 
globalization of the auto industry, China has been added to 
Japan, the United States, and Europe for the production bases of 
the company, making it a quadripolar system, but with the effect 
of the high yen, a phenomenon of deindustrialization at home is 
beginning with a move of facilities from the Takami plant in 
Nagaoka city to a U.S. plant. For this reason, the company has a 
policy of aggressively promoting restructuring with the opening 
up of new market sectors as the pillar. 
  China is promoting a policy to cultivate the auto industry, 
the "Three Large and Three Small Projects," and the U.S. Big 
Three and Japanese automakers are accelerating their China 
strategy with an eye to the future. Nippon Seiki also began 
providing technology to the Beijing Auto Instrument and Meter 
Plant of the Beijing Auto Industry Federated Corporation Group 
in 1992, and is proposing instrument production technology for 
the "Cherokee" jeep which the Beijing group is producing in a 
joint venture with Chrysler of the United States, but their 
China strategy will be moving greatly forward with this direct 
expansion. 
  At the same time, domestic deindustrialization 
countermeasures are also surfacing as a issue, which will 
progress further in the future. The company is building 
production bases in the United States and Europe in response to 
the overseas expansion by automakers who are their clients, and 
the overseas production ratio is beginning to expand due to the 
advance of the high yen. In the past, expansion of local 
production meant increasing capability, but a drop in domestic 
competitiveness was behind the decision to move the production 
line of the Takami plant to a U.S. plant in December 1993. 
  For this reason, the company is promoting business 
diversification, and its policy is to boost fields other than 
the instrument business to occupy 50 percent of total sales. It 
is thinking of proceeding with a focus on electrical equipment 
for general living such as liquid crystals and remote controls, 
and on special machinery such as food packaging, and it can be 
said that such restructuring holds the future of the company.

  [Text] NEC has agreed with the China Academy of Science to 
establish in Beijing a joint-venture company for research and 
development of computer software. It will be inaugurated in the 
middle of next month by joint financing with the Software 
Research Institute under the Academy of Science umbrella. They 
will deal in middleware used in open systems, software 
development tools for the Chinese market, and changing basic 
software (OS) [operating systems] into Chinese. The software 
research and development company joint venture is a first in 
China, and NEC will secure a foothold in the software business 
in China, which is expected to be a computer growth market. 
  The new company will be "NEC-China Academy of Science 
Software Research Institute Limited Corporation." It is 
scheduled to be established on 15 June, the head office will be 
in Beijing, and NEC manager Yasutsugu Kokubo has been appointed 
president. The capital is 150 million yen; NEC will invest 90 
percent and the China Academy of Science Software Research 
Institute, which is the software division of the China Academy 
of Science, will invest 10 percent. The period of the joint 
venture is 12 years. 
  Initially, they will start with a staff of 50 people with 
researchers at the Software Institute as the core, and will 
expand to 200 people in the future. The main targets of research 
and development will be middleware to open construction of 
systems connecting different kinds of work stations and personal 
computers and multimedia-related software. Moreover, they will 
be in charge of development of CASE [computer-aided software 
engineering] (software development using computers) tools for 
the Chinese market and making UNIX and other OS Chinese. 
  Commissioned research and development from NEC will be at 
the 
center, but they aim to increase independent research gradually 
and acquire orders other than from NEC. Sales are projected at 
60 million yen in the first fiscal year and 200 million after 
five years. NEC evaluates the Software Research Institute with 
which they have had a cooperative relationship in software 
development for five years as "a research agency where the 
highest level of engineers are gathered in China" (Senior 
director Makoto Kobayashi), and they decided to utilize it 
further as a strategic NEC base for the Chinese market.

  [Text] Calsonic will double its sales in the European 
region to 200 million pounds (about 30 billion yen) by 2000 with 
"Llanelli Radiator," a local production subsidiary purchased 
from Rover of Great Britain, as the axis. Currently, it is 96 
million pounds (about 15 billion yen). It has acquired orders 
for aluminum radiators for next-model compact cars such as VW 
and Audi of Germany and Renault of France, as well as for the 
locally produced cars of affiliates Nissan Motor and Honda Motor 
and will gradually expand production beginning this fall. 
  Calsonic has received an order for the next model of the 
compact car "Concerto" from Honda of UK Manufacturing (HUM), the 
British production subsidiary of Honda Motor. HUM plans to 
produce 50,000 units annually beginning in the latter half of 
1994 in order to build an annual production system of 100,000 
cars, and Suranesurii received the order for the whole quantity. 
  They will supply 130,000 units annually beginning this fall 
for the next model of the "Audi 80" for Volkswagen-Audi of 
Germany. 
  They also have received an order for radiators for 
"Netherlands Car" (abbreviated Nedocar), the joint-venture 
company between the Dutch Government-Volvo-Mitsubishi Motors, 
and will supply 180,000 units annually. Production is scheduled 
to begin in the middle of 1995. Since full production of the 
Nedocar will be 200,000 units annually, the order is for almost 
the whole quantity. 
  The next car type from Renault is the compact car "Clio." It 
is scheduled to begin production in 1997, and they will supply 
100,000 units annually. Since previously Valeo, a major parts 
manufacturer of Europe, had the monopoly on Renault cars, they 
have destroyed a corner of that by this order. 
  Since they are bolstering a substantial development and 
production system in Europe, Calsonic is building a new research 
and development center at Calsonic International Europe (CIE) 
which is its general controlling company in Europe. The total 
amount of the investment is about 2.2 million pounds. The 
development system also will be increased from the current 70 
people to 90 people. 
  Llanelli was purchased from Rover of Great Britain in 1989, 
and is supplying the whole quantity of a little less than 
200,000 units annually of the aluminum radiators for Nissan 
Motor United Kingdom (NMUK). Llanelli still has a cumulative 
deficit of close to 10 billion yen, but as the result of broad 
sales expansion activities, the outlook is for it to be able to 
liquidate it by 2000.

  [Text] Major electrical machinery firms have begun one 
after the other to open resident offices in Vietnam. Not only 
will Matsushita Electric Industrial and Hitachi, Ltd. soon build 
resident offices in Ho Chi Minh City, Mitsubishi Electric will 
also open an office with this fall as the goal. That is because 
Vietnam has a large population, said to be about 70 million 
people; and, not only is a large demand for home electronics 
products such as televisions anticipated, an expansion of 
infrastructure demand is expected, such as communications and 
electric power facilities due to the social capital provision 
program of the government. Vietnam has been promoting the "doi 
moi [renovation] policy," an open economy policy, since 1986, 
but in particular, a big incentive for the various electrical 
machinery firms to expand has been the U.S. Government's lifting 
of economic sanctions against Vietnam in February 1994. 
  The resident office that Matsushita is opening has the 
objectives of a survey of the Vietnamese home electronics market 
and preparation of distribution and sales systems. Now that it 
has received permission by the Vietnamese Government to open, it 
is studying the lineup and will dispatch a resident 
representative from Japan. Since televisions and refrigerators 
are flowing into Vietnam via local distributors from the 
company's plants in neighboring Thailand and Malaysia, the plan 
is to first establish an after-service system and build an 
independent sales network for the future. 
  In addition to sales of home electronics products, Hitachi 
is 
aiming at the infrastructure demand for power plants and 
communications facilities. Moreover, Hitachi Sales, the home 
electronics sales subsidiary, will open an office in Ho Chi Minh 
City with July 1994 as the goal. 
  In expansion aimed at orders for public works projects, NEC 
newly established a resident office in Hanoi in July 1993; 
Fujitsu also established an office in Hanoi in March 1994. 
Mitsubishi Electric is also proceeding with preparations to open 
a resident office in Ho Chi Minh City with this fall as a goal, 
and Toshiba also is studying it. Behind the promising view of 
Vietnam, the point cannot be avoided that the people have more 
purchasing power than appearances due to money sent from 
Vietnamese in the United States. According to Victor Co. of 
Japan, which has been producing color televisions since 1985 by 
providing technology to a local state-operated plant, the 1994 
television market is about 400,000 televisions. The outlook is 
for it to expand to 3 million sets within 10 years.

  [Text] Samsung Electronics, the general electrical 
machinery manufacturer of the Samsung Group, South Korea's 
largest zaibatsu [conglomerate], is buying out over-the-counter 
public-offered companies of Japan. They have acquired 51 percent 
of the stock issued by Lux, the high-class audio manufacturer 
under reconstruction with the assistance of the Alps Electric 
group, and hold management rights. The prestigious brand firm, 
which has lost competitive power with the high yen, is aiming 
for reconstruction with South Korean capital. It is the first 
buyout of a Japanese public-offered stock company by a South 
Korean firm. It seems that along with the acceleration of 
company tieups between Japan and Asia via the exchange of 
capital, moves have broadened for restructuring Japanese firms 
using mergers and acquisitions with Asian capital as a lever. 
  Alpine, a car audio manufacturer, which is a subsidiary of 
Alps Electric and the chief stockholder of Lux, transferred all 
the 1.63 million Lux stock that it owned to Samsung Electronics. 
Furthermore, Lux will implement a third party-allotted capital 
increase with Samsung Electronics as the other party. Samsung 
Electronics will hold 51 percent of the stock. 
  The amount of the buyout is estimated at about 2 billion yen 
to 2.5 billion yen, combining the buying of existing stock and 
payment to the third party-allotted capital increase. Lux's 
liabilities in excess of assets will be liquidated by this. 
However, South Korea regulates foreign currency carried out of 
the country and it is estimated that the actual payment will be 
about August. 
  Lux has its headquarters in Yokohama city, and sales for the 
March 1994 quarter were slightly over 2 billion yen. Its size is 
small, but the "Luxman" brand is famous in the United States, 
Europe, and throughout the world. 
  Samsung Electronics, on the other hand, is a large firm that 
deals in computers, communications, and home electronics; 
December 1993 quarter sales were about 8,155 billion won (about 
1.06 trillion yen), and the ordinary profit was 374 billion won 
(about 49 billion yen). 
  Although it is in the ranks of first-class electronics 
manufacturers, standing as tops in the world in semiconductor 
memory production volume, it has played second fiddle to 
Japanese manufacturers in distinction and image in the field of 
home electronics where brands have power. By buying out a 
prestigious brand firm, it will obtain an improved product image 
and high-class audio production technology. This is very useful 
for Samsung Electronics, which aims to break into the Southeast 
Asian and Chinese markets, where the demand for home electronics 
is increasing faster than in the advanced nations market. 
  Lux was established in 1935, and has been a pioneer in the 
Japanese audio trade. It had sales exceeding 7 billion yen in 
its golden age, but with the low-price product offensive of 
major AV [audiovisual] manufacturers, sales of high-class items 
which are its forte declined sharply. In the March 1994 quarter, 
the ordinary profit and loss showed a deficit of about 200 
million yen. Liabilities in excess of assets have continued and 
that amount reached 2.5 billion yen at the end of the March 1993 
quarter. As it stood, it became a situation where continued 
public offering of stock was difficult. 
  The Alps Electric group had capital participation in Lux in 
1980 and has continued assistance. However, Alpine's major 
product is the car radio, and there being little merit in having 
Lux remain in the group, Alps Electric turned to an ordinary 
deficit of 4.6 billion yen in the March 1994 quarter. Suffering 
a worsening business environment, it decided to sell to Samsung 
Electronics, which saw that it could use the brand-name and the 
technology. 
  The Japanese industrial world is suffering a serious 
earnings 
slump with the prolonged recession. Although it is being pressed 
for drastic restructuring such as the sale of unprofitable 
enterprises, it has been difficult to find the proper receptacle 
at home. If the move broadens for Asian capital which is rich in 
growth capability to purchase Japanese brands and technology, it 
seems that the industrial redisposition between Japan and Asia 
will accelerate.

  [Text] The decision by Samsung Electronics to buy Lux 
indicates that Japanese firms have been included in the 
investment targets of South Korean firms which are active in 
overseas M&amp;A [mergers and acquisitions]. Since Japanese firms 
have technology capability and brand power that South Korean 
firms do not have, it is believed that South Korean firms will 
embark on the buy-out of Japanese firms not only in home 
electronics, but also auto parts, etc., in the future. 
  South Korean firms are losing price competitiveness along 
with the rise in personnel costs, and improvement in technology 
capability has become an urgent necessity. For this reason, they 
have been active in M&amp;A these past few years to acquire 
technology. Last year, Modern Electronics Industries, the 
largest South Korean electrical equipment manufacturer, acquired 
40 percent of the stock of Macstar, a major U.S. manufacturer of 
hard disk devices (HDD) used in computer memory storage. Samsung 
Electronics also bought Harris Microwave Semiconductor, a U.S. 
compound semiconductor manufacturer, last year. 
  The aim of this buy-out also is the acquisition of 
high-class 
audio product technology capability and the prestigious brand of 
Lux. The development speed of firms in advanced nations such as 
Japan is fast in technology aspects, and it is not easy for 
South Korean firms to catch up. 
  It also takes considerable time to improve brand image. A 
buy-out is the quickest way to obtain that. They probably also 
have judged that now is "the time to buy" Japanese firms which 
have been suffering in business with the prolonged recession. 
  South Korean firms are expanding scale and acquiring 
financial power riding on the high growth of South Korea. It is 
whispered in the South Korean financial world that "there are 
firms besides Samsung Electronics which aim at a buy-out of 
Japanese firms or capital participation." Regarding the 
management of Lux, Samsung Electronics "will make use of the 
Japanese management and support the management of President 
Hayakawa," and is giving care to the Japanese side. If the 
buy-out by Samsung Electronics succeeds, there is a great 
possibility that it will be an opportunity for South Korean 
firms to undertake constructively the buy-out of Japanese firms.

  [Text] Marubeni has made a business tieup with a major oil 
company of Russia, Siberia Far East Petroleum (SIDANCO, Moscow). 
Marubeni will cooperate with SIDANCO from delivery of machinery 
and facilities for drilling and refining to capital procurement 
and overseas expansion. In the future, they also will consider 
investment. The Russian Government has the idea of cultivating 
major domestic firms into [international] majors (international 
oil capital). Marubeni's plan is to ensure an oil supply base 
for Japan through this tieup. 
  SIDANCO was just established on 5 May. Eight oil production, 
transport, and refining companies with Tyumen Province of 
Western Siberia as a home base and the Russian government have 
jointly financed it. The crude oil production capability of the 
group is 700,000 barrels a day. Their scale follows Rosnefte and 
Look [as transliterated] Oil in Russia. In the future, they also 
are scheduling oil field development in the eastern part of 
Russia such as Eastern Siberia and the Far East, and expansion 
to China and Vietnam as well. 
  Marubeni has made a tieup with a U.S. oil company, 
Anglo-Swiss (Houston, Texas), which has a record of establishing 
joint-venture firms with Russia. Besides cooperating in order to 
bring financing from Japanese Government-affiliated agencies on 
the development of new mining areas at home and abroad by 
SIDANCO, they are undertaking the export of pipe. Furthermore, 
they are prepared to invest in any case since the Russian 
Government has approved acquisition of up to 15 percent of 
SIDANCO stock (currently 5 billion yen) by foreign investment. 
  Marubeni views SIDANCO as being able to become a supply 
source of crude oil and petroleum products for Japan which is 
close in terms of distance. 
  Currently, two groups, the Japan-U.S.-Europe five-company 
cartel with Mitsui Corp., and a cartel with U.S. Exxon and 
Sakhalin Oil Development Cooperation (SODECO), a Japanese 
Government and privately financed company, are proceeding with a 
development program off Sahalin, but the possibility has emerged 
that a new export to Japan project with the participation of 
Japanese firms will appear.

  [Text] Oil prospecting and development projects off 
Vietnam, which started along with expectations for discovering 
new oil fields, are entering the second stage without seeing any 
big results. On 19 April, a U.S.-Japan cartel which Mobil of the 
United States formed with Japanese firms such as Japan Petroleum 
Exploration formally signed a contract acquiring rights to the 
Blue Dragon (05-1b mining area) off the south. Moreover, the 
Arabian Oil and Teikoku Oil group, which has drilled two test 
wells so far and failed with both, has obtained a "firm-in" from 
Mobil of the United States and BP of Great Britain, and has 
started study on a third test well. Mitsubishi Oil also has 
begun drilling a test well for the first time. Moreover, 
Idemitsu Kosan is making test wells off the north. However, the 
situation is that if "results" do not appear with these test 
projects, it is predicted that the Vietnam "oil development 
boom" will cool rapidly. The project which is being conducted 
centering on Arabian Oil and Teikoku Oil symbolizes the oil 
development work off of Vietnam. They have dug two test wells so 
far, but both entered a high-pressure gas layer before reaching 
the target depth, they stopped the operation and abandoned both. 
Idemitsu Kosan also is conducting test drilling in a mining area 
off the north, but the first was "empty," they now are drilling 
the second, and are at the stage of watching for "results" that 
will appear in May. Mitsubishi Oil also began drilling their 
first test well in April, and the results will appear in early 
summer. Except for Blue Dragon by the Mobil-Japan Petroleum 
Exploration-Indonesian Oil-Nissho Iwai group, all physical 
prospecting has ended and they have begun drilling test wells, 
but the expected "results" have not appeared so far. Since oil 
development off of Vietnam had appeared to be one of the few 
promising areas remaining in Southeast Asia, the international 
trade war has "become overheated" and the so-called sign bonus 
rate which is paid to Vietnam at the time of the contract is 
said to have become very highly "irregular" for these kind of 
business talks. The final conclusion as to whether or not they 
have made an expensive purchase will come soon.

  [Text] Kashima Oil, an oil refining company which has 
produced a huge exchange loss exceeding 150 billion yen, 
announced restructuring on the 20th. According to this, the plan 
is that they will proceed with restructuring with assistance 
amounting to 107.5 billion yen such as guarantee of obligations 
from various stockholder companies, and complete coverage of the 
loss within 10 years. The burden of the various stockholder 
companies is according to investment ratio, but capital 
increases will be postponed. Vice President Takeji Fukuda of 
Japan Energy, the leading stockholder, has been appointed to 
succeed President Hachiro Obata who resigned to take 
responsibility. By settlement of the restructuring plan, the 
restructuring of Kashima Oil will begin specific action. 
  Taking responsibility for the loss, four people resigned, 
President Obata, Vice President Kenichi Shinbo, advisor Yutaka 
Okada, and consultant Noburu Ishino. Along with bringing in 
President Fukuda as a replacement, Senior Director Yoshiro 
Yamamoto has been appointed vice president having right of 
representation. 
  The confirmed amount of the loss is 152.3 billion yen. The 
capital to cover this will be supplied by 107.5 billion yen from 
the five stockholder companies of J Energy, Mitsubishi 
Petrochemical, Cosmo Oil, Tokyo Electric Power, and Nippon 
Yusen; 34.8 billion yen from the sale of negotiable securities 
and disposition of internal reserves; and 10 billion yen in 
loans from the Industrial Bank of Japan. 
  For the assistance from the stockholders in this, the sale 
of 
assets such as tank facilities to stockholders and financing 
from stockholders will be the pillar besides 70-80 billion yen 
in bank loans from guarantee of obligations. They will repay the 
principal on the loans at 7-8 billion yen each annually within 
the scope of ordinary profits. Moreover, the plan is to 
liquidate the liabilities in excess of assets generated in 
fiscal 1993 by special profits such as sales of assets this 
fiscal year and the deficit brought forward will also be 
liquidated by fiscal 1997.

  [Text] About 90 percent of listed firms are grappling with 
global environment issues, but the contents center on dealing 
with laws and regulations and saving energy that has a high 
effect on investment. This situation was revealed in the survey 
report "Current Status and Evaluation of Corporate Measures in 
Global Environment Issues" announced on 12 May by the Science 
and Technology Policy Research Institute of the Science and 
Technology Agency. 
  The research institute implemented the survey targeting 500 
listed firms, and obtained responses from 263 companies. 
  As the incentive for undertaking global environment issues, 
98 percent of the firms cited "social responsibility," and 95.8 
percent of firms are devising some environmental measures. A 
trend was seen that the larger the firm, the more it was 
aggressively undertaking it. 
  Viewing the content of the environmental measures, 89.3 
percent of the firms are undertaking "environment-related" 
measures such as environmental pollution and noise 
countermeasures, and many are dealing with laws and regulations 
or high effect on investment, such as 93.3 percent for 
"resources-related" measures such as conservation. On the other 
hand, only 9.5 percent of the firms were carrying out "ecosystem 
maintenance-related" measures such as prevention of reckless 
development. 
  As for problems of undertaking global environment issues, 
91.7 percent cited high cost of new facilities investment and 
the drop in production efficiency, and they are concerned about 
a decline in competitiveness. 
  Moreover, as provision of social conditions, 87.8 percent of 
the firms demanded preferential tax treatment or financial 
subsidies from national or local public bodies. The firms that 
sought approval to shift costs to the public or a review of 
lifestyles exceeded 60 percent. 
  An table for overall evaluation of the handling of global 
environment issues by firms is attached to the report. The 
research institute distributed the report to about 500 
companies, and is urging each firm to grasp objectively the 
actual state of their own company's handling of environmental 
issues and make a self-diagnosis using this evaluation table.

  [Text] The Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry [MITI], has decided on a 
policy of holding down the policy goal increase rate for the 
amount of energy consumed by 2010 to an annual average of 0.9 
percent. The amount of energy consumed has continued to increase 
at an annual rate of about 3 percent for the past 10 years, but 
they are dealing with an agreement by the various advanced 
nations to hold down the supply of fossil fuels centering on 
petroleum to prevent global warming. MITI is promoting 
energy-saving measures such as popularization of new energies 
and introduction of summer time [daylight savings time]. 
  The final domestic energy consumption amount recorded in 
1992 
was 360 million kiloliters. They are promoting work on a review 
of the "Outlook for Long-Term Energy Supply and Demand" in the 
Supply and Demand Subcommittee of the General Energy Research 
Committee (MITI consulting organ), and will incorporate this 
policy in the report compiled at the end of June. 
  MITI is forecasting the amount of consumption divided into 
the case where existing policy is continued and the case where 
new energy-saving policy is implemented. Consumption in 2010 
will be 425 million kiloliters to 446 million kiloliters 
converted to crude oil. The rate of increase under the existing 
policy is an annual average of 1.2 percent. It is expected to be 
0.9 percent when energy-saving policies are added. Since an 
increase in supply of fossil fuels such as petroleum or coal is 
difficult from the viewpoint of preventing global warming, it 
was decided to make the target increase rate for consumption an 
annual rate of 0.9 percent. 
  In order to promote energy-saving measures, MITI has a 
policy 
of promoting electric cars and development subsidies for 
high-efficiency boilers.

  [Text] The study work on a "green GDP" [gross domestic 
product] indicating the monetary cost to the environment such as 
destruction of the environment or loss of resources is having 
rough sailing. Three ministries and agencies, the Environment 
Agency, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, 
and the Economic Planning Agency [EPA], have been doing joint 
research in a three-year program since fiscal 1992, but they are 
still no further than "the study stage" (EPA). The prospects are 
that preparation of a specific proposal will be slipped to next 
fiscal year or thereafter. The main cause is that many elements 
must be considered in the worsening of the environment such as 
atmosphere, water quality, and soil, and the calculation has 
become complicated. Also in the background is the fact that 
attention has been diverted to economic growth with the 
prolonged sluggish economy, and concern about environment issues 
is waning. 
  The green GDP also is called the "environment economic 
calculation" and it reckons the monetary cost of environmental 
pollution or the extent of environmental destruction and the 
outlay it will require to preserve the environment. This is 
checked against the GDP proper as the cost to the environment 
and the aim is to see the relationship between economic growth 
and preservation of the environment. 
  The reason the study work has not progressed is due to the 
many items comprising the green GDP. 
  For example, if there were tropical rain forests where the 
chief problem was felling of forests, the cost to the 
environment would be easily calculated. However, the economy of 
an advanced nation like Japan embraces many problems linked to 
worsening of the environment such as various kinds of pollution, 
waste materials, fluorocarbon gas exhaust, or reduction of 
resources, and it is difficult to see or determine what the cost 
is. The progress of technology also has been swift on 
reutilization of resources and pollution prevention, and is 
making it difficult to decide on the scope of calculations.

  [Text] Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. (Toshinobu Wada, 
president) revealed on 10 May a policy to commence beginning in 
June construction of a natural gas supply pipeline to the 
Sapporo area from the Hokkaido Yufutsu Gas Fields where they 
have been promoting prospecting and development projects. The 
total length will be about 75 kilometers and the diameter, 14 
inches. The total construction cost, including processing plant, 
is about 52 billion yen. It will be completed in March 1996, and 
supply of natural gas to Hokkaido Gas is scheduled to begin in 
April of the same year. Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. 
currently is carrying out construction work on a natural gas 
pipeline between Niigata and Sendai also, and two big projects 
in the country are heading toward reality at the same time by 
this. The Yufutsu Gas Fields are comprised of the structures 
(gas fields) at Akebono, South Yufutsu, and Numa no Hata in the 
vicinity of Tomakomai city. According to the test wells so far 
executed at the various structures, they have confirmed a 
considerable amount of natural gas and condensate (natural 
gasoline). At the same time as the confirmation work on the 
amount of gas ore, they have conducted negotiations for 
commercialization with Hokkaido Gas who will be the one 
supplied. As a result, a basic agreement already has been 
reached between the two companies with a shift to development 
projects, and the start of supply has been informally decided to 
begin in April 1996. However, the sales contract on natural gas, 
which will be the formal contract, could not be settled at the 
end of last year when it was initially scheduled because of the 
"opposition" of both companies on the aspect of price, and 
negotiations have crossed over into the new year and have gone 
down to the present day. However, since agreement is being 
formed in outline, they have embarked on the start of 
construction. Moreover, the pipeline will take the form of 
placement underground beneath roads and the permission of the 
road administrators will be necessary, but the Ministry of 
Construction and related municipalities basically tend to 
approve this.

  [Text] Hokkaido Gas has firmed up a plan to make a 
facilities investment of 11.898 billion yen during fiscal 1994. 
The company's plan is to begin supplying natural gas in fiscal 
1996, and it made large facilities investment (about 12 billion 
yen in initial plan) last fiscal year, an increase of about 30 
percent over the previous year. It will maintain a high level 
this fiscal year also and will invest about 10 billion yen for 
two consecutive years. It seems that the large investment by 
Hokkaido Gas will serve as a motive force for the economy in 
Hokkaido which partially has begun to seem bright ahead. 
  The amount of facilities investment on natural gas-related 
construction this fiscal year by the company will be 4.01 
billion yen. It has begun construction on the Hiroshima Supply 
Station (Hiroshima-cho in Ishikari jurisdiction), Moere Governor 
Station (Sapporo city), the "Sapporo Trunk Line," a 
high-pressure pipeline (about 41 kilometers) connecting them to 
the Ishikari plant (Ishikari-cho in Ishikari jurisdiction), and 
the "Moere Trunk Line" (about 10 kilometers) that will supply 
gas from Moere to within Sapporo city. Moreover, full-scale 
construction will also begin on the "Atsubetsu Trunk Line" for 
the Hiroshima Supply Station and Atsubetsu Supply Station (about 
5.5 kilometers) on which construction started last year. 
  Aside from natural gas-related construction, it will invest 
2.077 billion yen in manufacturing facilities, 3.69 billion yen 
in supply facilities, 2.085 billion yen in business facilities, 
and 34 million yen in incidental facilities. In the 
manufacturing facilities, besides enlargening the gas generation 
facility which makes city gas from LPG [liquefied petroleum gas] 
at the Ishikari plant, they will continue additional 
construction of gas tanks at the Atsubetsu Supply Station. 
  The company is proceeding with a program to change city gas 
in Sapporo city to natural gas over about 10 years starting in 
fiscal 1996. It plans natural gas-related investment of 30 
billion yen in the three-year period from fiscal 1993 to 1995. 
In a survey by the Hokkaido Regional Bureau of International 
Trade and Industry, while the facilities investment programs for 
fiscal 1994 by major firms in Hokkaido have decreased 34.5 
percent over the previous year in the manufacturing industry and 
5.4 percent in the nonmanufacturing industry, the facilities 
investment of gas enterprises have increased 38.8 percent, and 
become bright news. It seems that the facilities investment 
involving the company's change to natural gas will have an 
effect on reflating the economy of related industries.

  [Text] (Nagasaki) Tomiken (Omura, Nagasaki Prefecture; 
chairman, Hideo Tominaga), a building materials and home 
construction equipment sales and operations firm, announced on 
19 May that it will begin joint development and sales with Sharp 
of a solar power system incorporated in the roof of homes. 
  They judge that an environment in which this system will 
become popular with the average family has begun to be ready 
such as national subsidies for establishment of home solar power 
systems starting this fiscal year, and have decided to embark on 
sales. 
  The roof-incorporated system developed by Tomiken and Sharp 
directly incorporates solar battery modules (condenser and 
generator) in the roof, and has the characteristic of increased 
stability compared to the method of attaching them on top of 
existing roof tiles. 
  There are five levels of power, ranging from 1.8 kilowatts 
to 
5 kilowatts. The price is from 4.7 million yen to 9 million yen. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is trying 
to 
popularize home solar power as a link in using clean energy. 
Beginning this fiscal year, they will give a public subsidy of 
900,000 yen for 1 kilowatt in the construction of general 
housing. Moreover, surplus power during the daytime can be sold 
to electric power companies. 
  The plan is to market it together with an air cycle 
construction method developed by Fukubi Chemical Industries 
(Fukui city) which coaxes out energy savings through air 
circulation since "a solar power system alone still leaves a 
sense of being relatively high in equipment cost compared to the 
amount saved from electric power rates" (Chairman Tominaga).

  [Text] Sony is being more thorough in the creation of 
products that consider environmental problems such as ease of 
recycling, centering on its domestic and overseas television 
divisions. Previously, checks were made of the dismantling time 
and recycling possibilities for each model in its domestic 
Products Design Division, but beginning in April, it introduced 
an environment inspection evaluation system with specific target 
values, and also widened the scope to offices overseas. Manuals 
targeted at Product Planning Division have also been newly 
prepared and consideration of the environment is promoted 
consistently from the planning stage. A recycling research 
committee has also been established with an eye to the future 
and they are putting together a guide with next spring as the 
goal. 
  Checksheets for product design introduced by the company are 
being prepared for each division such as television and audio. 
For televisions, a total of nine items are checked: packing, 
energy consumption, harmful substances, use of plastic, use of 
recycled resources, reduction of resources used, product life, 
dismantling time, and recycling possibility. 
  Previously, inspections were by the O-X checklist method, 
but 
beginning in April, a quantitative evaluation containing 
specific target numbers was introduced. Combined with this, 
overseas offices with design divisions have begun to use it.. 
  Sony has prepared inspection manuals for product planning 
divisions that are in charge of research and development. They 
introduce an explanation of the laws and regulations on 
recycling and what items the design divisions will be checking. 
Explanations cite actual examples of products with consideration 
of the environment. 
  The recycling research committee is comprised of head office 
staff, centering on designers in the AV (audiovisual) Equipment 
Division, and persons in charge of the FA [factory automation] 
division. There are six to seven core members, and they are 
promoting research on recycled resources and recycling such as 
actually trying to disassemble discarded televisions from 
various firms, with the goal of giving feedback to design. 
  Sony established an in-house global environment committee in 
1990, and has promoted the undertaking of environment problems.

  [Text] "In fiscal 1993, 150,000 multimedia personal 
computers incorporating sound and animation were sold in Japan. 
However, it will increase many times with games in the future." 
Mutsuo Miyake, director of the Computer Division, Matsushita 
Electric Industrial, who attended a product announcement 
gathering in Tokyo on 11 May, expressed strong expectations with 
confidence in the work before him. Matsushita estimates that 
they have only a 15-percent share in the world, even including 
word processors, with 2.44 million units in 1993 on the Japanese 
personal computer market. For that alone, they are expecting 
that "latent demand is in the home" (Miyake). 
  Toshiba director Shoichi Koga, who attended the announcement 
of "EZ Vision," also emphasized that "Personal computers and 
television are products that will be the multimedia nucleus for 
family use. The big task is how to fuse them." EZ Vision is a 
simple mechanism that connects a personal computer to a 
television, but the function is said to be the same as 
multimedia. 
  Multimedia personal computers carrying CD-ROM are becoming 
the mainstream stand-alone type personal computer for home use 
in the United States also. They are used for various purposes, 
such as games and music entertainment and personal information 
management, and it is said that "by 2000, the world personal 
computer market will grow to $130 billion, and half of that will 
be for home use" (Eckhard Pfeiffer, president, Compaq Computer 
Corp.). 
  The fusion of television and personal computers, however, 
means fighting between the personal computer division and the AV 
[audiovisual] division. 
  In October 1993, Toshiba reorganized its personal 
information 
equipment division and video media division under the same 
group. The objective was "to aim at a multiplier effect for 
development of multimedia" (Koga). However, Matsushita, whose 
computer division has embarked on television personal computers, 
emphasizes that "the AV division will also probably put out 
television personal computers in the future" (Miyake) and "the 
early bird gets the worm." Such fighting applies also to home 
electronics manufacturers and computer manufacturers. An officer 
of IBM Japan forecasts a battle without honor, saying, "The 
fence between home electronics and computers will collapse with 
the appearance of television personal computers, and personal 
computer manufacturers will come to fight in the home 
electronics arena. To home electronics manufacturers, it 
probably gives the impression that their own market is being 
devastated by a stampede." 
  It cannot be overlooked that behind the possibility of 
television and personal computer fusion are the popularity of 
the basic "Windows" software, which is premised on CPU (central 
processing unit) high performance and graphics processing, and 
the provision of a hardware environment such as low price and 
large-capacity memory storage. Sharp also trial-manufactured a 
personal computer incorporating a television in 1982, but it 
seems that the point now will be whether they can effectively 
propose what can be done with the fusion of television and 
personal computers.

  [Text] Toshiba announced on 11 May six types of machines 
such as a notebook-type personal computer and full-scale 
portable subnotebook personal computer for multimedia that can 
be connected to the family television. By putting the new series 
on sale, Toshiba aims to ship 1 million (about 40 percent 
increase over the previous year) personal computers worldwide in 
fiscal 1994. 
  The "Dynabook EZ Vision" for multimedia not only is used as 
an independent notebook personal computer, but game software can 
also be enjoyed with impressive graphics and sound by connecting 
it to a large television in the home. 
  Without provision of any special device, it can output 
personal computer graphics and audio from the screen and stereo 
speakers if it is connected to the family television. It is a 
response to those who want to enjoy games and multimedia 
software on a big screen. It is loaded with Japanese word 
processing and spreadsheet software and also can be used 
immediately by beginners after purchase. The price is 278,000 
yen. 
  The subnotebook "SS series" is the first in the world to 
house two memory devices, a floppy disk and hard disk, in a B5 
file size main body. They aimed at about the same functions as a 
desktop personal computer while being small and lightweight with 
a weight of 1.95 kilograms. 
  There are both an 8-inch color liquid crystal display model 
and monochrome model. The price is 398,000 yen for the color and 
298,000 yen for the monochrome.

  [Text] Matsushita Electric Industrial announced on 11 May 
that it will put on sale on 21 June a "television personal 
computer" where television can be seen and CD's [compact disks] 
enjoyed on the screen of a personal computer which houses a 
television tuner. Matsushita is introducing their forte of AV 
technology into personal computers, and further strengthening 
their information home electronics field. The shipment of 
personal computers for multimedia which can process graphics and 
audio in addition to character data is expanding year by year, 
and IBM Japan, NEC, and others are also planning to introduce 
products which have a television function. If a communications 
service for both is begun in the future, there also are 
expectations that the "television personal computer" will become 
the favorite multimedia terminal within the home, and 
competition has begun between home electronics and personal 
computer manufacturers concerning the new market. 
  The DOS/V specification personal computer "Woody" which 
Matsushita Electric Industrial is putting on sale is standard 
equipped with audio multiplex television tuner, stereo speakers, 
and a CD-ROM device (read only memory using compact disk). 
Besides being able to see television on a 14-inch personal 
computer screen, CD-ROM, music CD's, and "photo CD's" that store 
photos on CD's also can be enjoyed. 
  Television programs can be received even while operating the 
personal computer. For example, a news program is shown in a 
corner of the screen while preparing a document with word 
processing software. In order to digitize the analog television 
video, the necessary scene is made into a static graphic and 
introduced as data video in the document, and can be stored on a 
hard disk. Use by beginners is assumed and recording of graphics 
is performed by a simple button operation. 
  The price is 358,000 yen for the model which carries a 
170-megabyte hard disk, and 398,000 yen for the 340-megabyte 
model. They are set at a rather high price compared to 
multimedia personal computers equipped with a CD-ROM device. 
"The target is the young age group of students up to 31 years 
old. Rather than enjoyment by the whole family, demand for one 
machine per person is expected." (Mutsuo Miyake, manager, 
Computer Division, Matsushita Electric Industrial) They are 
scheduling yearly production of 50,000 machines. 
  IBM Japan soon will put on sale a television personal 
computer carrying a television tuner with "PS/V vision" as the 
basis. With price on the mid-300,000 yen level, it will directly 
run up against the new products of Matsushita Electric 
Industrial. NEC also believes that "The color screen of a 
personal computer can be applied to television, telephones, and 
facsimile. We will be steadily introducing information equipment 
in the home" (Director Yuki Takayama). The time has not yet been 
decided, but it appear that they will introduce a television 
personal computer within the year. 
  It seems that they will proceed quickly in the future with 
"making a personal computer home appliance" that incorporates 
various functions such as a telephone and facsimile.

  [Text] Mitsubishi Motors and Mitsubishi Corp. agreed on 12 
May to investigate forming a corporation to begin production of 
auto parts such as engines in China in a joint venture with a 
corporate group from Malaysia. President Hirokazu Nakamura of 
Mitsubishi Motors, Vice President Naoyasu Kuroki of Mitsubishi 
Corp., and Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia signed a 
memorandum in Beijing on the same day. Mitsubishi Motors has not 
had a production base for finished cars in China, but hopes to 
secure a base for the future production of passenger cars by 
taking the form of a trinational joint venture with Malaysia, 
which has deep connections with the Chinese government. 
  China is adding the obligation to have the local parts 
procurement rate over 40 percent when foreign affiliated firms 
enter passenger car production as a pillar of their new auto 
policy beginning in 1996. For this reason, "Proton," the 
joint-venture passenger car production company between 
Mitsubishi Motors and Malaysia made a proposal to the Chinese 
Government of market entry after local production of parts. The 
joint-venture parts plant will study export of parts to Malaysia 
also along with supply of auto parts in China. The location of 
the plant and production scale await conclusion of the 
investigation on forming a corporation and will be decided 
within the year. Joint-venture production by Japanese and Asian 
firms in China is an exceptional case. 
  According to a Chinese Government source, there also is a 
proposal to build a joint-venture auto plant in Huizhou and to 
produce small passenger cars with a displacement of 1500 cc. 
  Among Japanese auto makers, Suzuki has joint venture 
production of light autos in China, but Mitsubishi Motors will 
be the first major finished car maker to embark on joint-venture 
production of auto parts.

  [Text] On 24 May, Sumitomo Corporation announced it will 
collaborate with Tele-Communications (TCI), the largest U.S. 
CATV operating firm to provide multimedia services in Japan. Two 
joint ventures will be established within the year to include a 
firm to manage and operate the CATV firms currently owned by 
Sumitomo in Japan and another firm to offer programming services 
using communications satellite systems. Sumitomo will separate 
and transfer CATV operations and programming services to the new 
firms and utilize the abundant knowledge of TCI in running the 
joint ventures. 
  The two firms recently exchanged a memorandum establishing 
the joint ventures. Operating plans and capital requirements 
will be the subject of pending discussions and the schedule 
calls for establishment of the joint ventures by the end of the 
year. According to sources at Sumitomo, TCI "wants to contribute 
about 40 percent of the capital" for each joint venture, but its 
initial contribution will be restricted to the amount specified 
by foreign capital regulations. 
  Sumitomo plans to transfer all capital already paid into the 
18 CATV firms operated throughout the country into the newly 
established CATV management firm. It will enter into discussions 
with other shareholders of the CATV firms concerning the joint 
ventures. In the future, Sumitomo plans to buy additional CATV 
stations, engage in consulting services, and contract for 
management services, with the goal of becoming Japan's first 
multiple system operator. It will also engage in the 
implementation of telephone services via CATV. The president of 
the firm will be appointed from among Sumitomo officials and TCI 
will assign two directors. 
  The joint venture engaged in programming services plans to 
establish multiple channel services to include animated films, 
documentaries, and sports broadcasting. Estimates of new capital 
requirements for the two joint ventures for the next three to 
four years totals $500 million.

  [Text] The cable television (CATV) industry and new common 
carriers will collaborate in experiments to integrate 
broadcasting and communications, an effort which is considered 
to be a precursor to multimedia. Twenty-two firms, including 
CATV firms such as Tokyu Cable Television and new common 
carriers such as DDI [Dainidenden], electrical equipment makers, 
and trading companies will organize a consortium this week and 
conduct experiments over a two-year period to identify potential 
problems associated with commercialization of the concept. This 
will be the first case in which CATV and new common carriers 
interlink to form a combined communication network. Intracity 
telephone networks are currently controlled by Nippon Telegraph 
and Telephone (NTT), but if the new common carriers collaborate 
with CATV firms with circuits reaching individual households and 
establish nationwide networks, there is the potential to build a 
system that rivals that of NTT. It appears that the broadcasting 
and communications industries are about to reorganize based on 
deregulation. 
  Aside from major CATV firms and the new common carriers, 
firms participating in the experiments will be Kokusai Denshin 
Denwa (KDD), manufacturers such as NEC and trading companies 
such as Mitsui &amp; Co. and Secom, which has an interest in 
remote 
medical services via CATV. The Cable Television Conference, a 
CATV industry organization, established a "full-service network 
committee" as part of the conference on the 24th. The committee 
will serve as the administrative arm of the conference to manage 
the two-year experiment and will solicit participation by CATV 
firms on a nationwide basis. 
  The experiments will consider links between CATV networks 
and 
communications networks of new common carriers. The results will 
be used in the development of combined networks for use by fixed 
telephone instruments, personal handyphone systems (PHS), 
personal computer communications, and television shopping. Even 
the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] is promoting 
the concept. 
  Next-generation CATV that integrates broadcasting and 
communications is considered one of the infrastructures 
envisioning implementation of multimedia, and there are 
scattered moves to commercialize the concept. A CATV firm in 
Nagano Prefecture is experimenting with telephone services via 
CATV and in Kansai the MOPT-sponsored conference is planning to 
start a systems integration experiment using optical fiber 
networks beginning this summer.

  [Text] With an eye on the advent of the multimedia era, 
NEC's software business is getting serious. It has decided to 
cultivate as an external sales enterprise the software business, 
which previously had been kept to a minimum and was centered on 
that for the group. It has also begun to put effort into 
scouting overseas software. Moreover, the fully financed NEC 
Home Electronics (NEC-HE) will jointly own software for 
high-performance game machines that will go on sale at the end 
of the year along with the NEC personal computer "PC 98," and 
support establishment of the external sales business of the 
software itself. While the poor earnings rate of hardware 
continues, the NEC group plans to expand the software business 
of the whole group from the two sections of personal computers 
by the main company and game machines by NEC-HE. 
  NEC established the "C&amp;C Multimedia Business Promotion 
Division" on 25 April to develop the multimedia business for the 
whole group, citing the slogan, "Multimedia NEC." (President 
Tadahiro Sekimoto) The "Personal Software Business Division" 
that was established on 8 April will be in charge of the 
software business. The policy is to cultivate external sales of 
software of about several billion yen in the first fiscal year 
and about 30 billion yen after three years. 
  However, the personal computer has a low popularity of 12 
percent and users are limited. For this reason, NEC-HE, which 
has been selling game machines for home use since 1987, "has 
increased in the importance it occupies in the multimedia 
strategy of all NEC" (Seiji Nakano, NEC-HE director). 
  Under these conditions, NEC-HE will put on sale in the 
latter 
part of November the high performance game machine "FX 
(tentative name) carrying a 32-bit MPU (microprocessing unit). 
The company was the first in the industry to put on sale a 
CD-ROM (read-only memory using compact disks) game machine in 
1988, but it was not compatible with the personal computer "98 
Multi" previously carrying an NEC CD-ROM drive and its software. 
That is considered "a link in the all NEC multimedia business" 
(NEC-HE president Tomoo Miyawaki) with the FX, and software for 
the FX can also be used on the PC 98. "We plan a multiplier 
effect by promoting development and sales of software from the 
business aspect for NEC proper and from the games and other 
personal user side for NEC-HE." President Miyawaki, who is 
concurrently appointed to managing director in charge of the NEC 
Personal C&amp;C Business Group, thus relates the aim to promote 
fusion of the FX and PC 98 series. 
  In addition to being able to use it on the PC 98, software 
for the FX can be connected as a CD-ROM drive device of the 98. 
Behind compatibility for FX software is the intense 32-bit game 
machine sales war. Matsushita Electric Industrial already has 
put on sale the "Real." In the same time period as NEC-HE, Sony 
will put on sale the "Play Station," and Sega Enterprises, the 
"Saturn (tentative name)," respectively. For that reason, there 
is a sense of crisis that "we must make effective use of the 
market for the PC 98 which has about 7.67 million machines 
distributed" (Director Nakano). 
  Furthermore, since it takes money and time to produce 32-bit 
CD-ROM software, software companies look at the state of 
popularity of the manufacturer's hardware. For this reason, 
being able to jointly own the best-seller personal computer 98 
and software is a strategy that will promote software production 
by "making it a plus for software company earnings" (President 
Miyawaki). 
  President Miyawaki always asserts that "if a game character 
can be skillfully incorporated into software for the personal 
computer, it will sell." For this reason, by having 
compatibility between FX software and the 98, they expect it to 
be linked to increases in external software sales of NEC proper, 
and not just the FX. 
  Along with the importance of the software business being 
greater than ever in the multimedia era, its multiple 
applicability will be necessary. The framework for the system in 
charge of development and sales within the group has already 
been created. Moreover, NEC Avenue (Kawasaki; president, Seiji 
Nakano) has embarked on strengthening game music CD's. With the 
FX on sale, and personal computers and game machines, a system 
will be provided enabling use of software on three types within 
the group. 
  How this organization operates in the future will hold the 
key to the success of the software business for the whole group 
and the realization of the ideal that "the sales ratio of 
hardware and software inherently should be one to one" 
(President Miyawaki).

  [Text] Mitsubishi Electric will jointly develop with 
Hitachi flash memory (read-only memory which can be 
electronically erased and rewritten all at once) which is the 
next-generation leading memory. They will employ the Mitsubishi 
method in 16-megabit products and the Hitachi method in 
64-megabit products, develop and sell uniform specification 
products. The aim is to rival Toshiba which is leading the flash 
memory market by tieups with U.S. and South Korean 
manufacturers. Since Toshiba, Hitachi, and Mitsubishi are 
respectively proceeding with development of unique methods with 
different specifications for flash memory, making their own 
method the de facto standard such as the format for VTR [video 
tape recorders] has become a big task for survival in the 
market. Various companies are competing furiously as they 
consider flash memory the next big product after DRAM [dynamic 
random-access memory] (dynamic read and write memory necessary 
for memory storage operations). However, it smacks of just talk 
in advance and there are some rather vague parts such as 
realistically to what applications will it be most directed? 
Moreover, viewed internationally, since the large U.S. 
semiconductor manufacturer Intel now hold the greatest market 
share, it seems a big task will be how to destroy the Intel 
stronghold.

  [Text] NEC and Bull, the largest computer manufacturer in 
France, have made a basic agreement on joint development of 
mainframe computers. A formal decision will be made at a 
top-level meeting of the two companies to be held in early June, 
and the outlook is for commercialization in 1995 or 1996. Since 
expansion of demand for mainframe machines is not anticipated 
with the advancement of downsizing (shift in demand to small 
machines), the burden of cost is becoming heavier for design and 
development such as a processing unit appropriate for high-speed 
processing. 
  Both companies, which will cooperate in the capital aspect, 
etc., will embark on sharing development in the mainframe field 
which is their main product, and hasten to rebuild the computer 
business. 
  There will be joint development of the highest grade machine 
type, the large "System 3900" (NEC product name) which NEC is 
OEM [original equipment manufacturer] supplying to Bull. The 
details of sharing design and development will be decided later, 
but it seems that the CPU (central processing unit) and board 
that carries the CPU which are the heart will be the object. NEC 
and Bull will respectively commercialize the jointly developed 
machine. 
  A CPU with a bipolar structure in which it is easy to 
increase processing speed will be used in the jointly developed 
machine. Furthermore, it is anticipated that there will be 
future study of cooperation in development of a parallel 
mainframe that will raise processing performance by lining up 
several CPU's with a CMOS (complementary metal-oxide 
semiconductor) structure which is easy to plan 0 costdowns. 
  In development of mainframe computers, it is said that it 
costs about 10 billion yen for a new machine type and several 
billion yen for an improvement. Both companies see that they can 
greatly alleviate the cost burden by sharing development. 
  NEC agreed at the end of 1993 to cooperate with Bull, whose 
business has seriously worsened, in a wide range of fields such 
as computers, communications, and electronic parts on the 
occasion of providing an additional investment of about 7 
billion yen (4.43 percent stockholding rate after increased 
investment), and has proceeded with specific discussions. This 
sharing of development in the field of mainframes will be the 
first shot and also implies Bull support.

  [Text] Toyota Motor and Honda Motor respectively will 
develop and locally produce "Asia Car," a low-price strategic 
passenger car for the Southeast Asian market. Both companies 
will develop them with existing 1300-cc to 1500-cc displacement 
compact cars as the base, and they will achieve low prices 
through local procurement of almost all parts in Asia. Toyota 
will mass-produce it in Thailand beginning in 1998 and export it 
to the Near and Middle East and Central and South America. Honda 
will manufacture and sell it in Thailand and Indonesia by 1996. 
Japanese automakers' shift of production to Asia is 
accelerating, and an international division of labor system of 
complementary parts and car types among many nations is 
advancing further. 
  Toyota is manufacturing and selling small trucks for Asia in 
Indonesia, the Philippines, and Taiwan, but it has not had an 
"Asia car" passenger car. Besides future anticipated growth of 
the passenger car market in Southeast Asia, the price of 
Japanese cars that use materials imported from Japan is becoming 
relatively high with the high yen, and Toyota is trying to 
develop a low-price car suitable for the Asian market by 
lowering manufacturing costs 5 to 10 percent from the existing 
level. 
  It will be produced by "Toyota Motor Thailand," the 
manufacturing company in Thailand beginning in 1998, using the 
"Tercel" or "Starlet" compact car as the base. 
  Toyota will procure parts from Toyota-affiliated engine and 
transmission plants in the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations (ASEAN) such as Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, and 
Indonesia, and at the same time as increasing the part domestic 
production rate in the region, it will also hold down production 
costs using local products for materials such as steel plate and 
resin. 
  Honda, on the other hand, is developing an "Asia car" with 
the existing "Civic" as the base. It appears that the overall 
size will be somewhat smaller than the "Civic." Honda will 
procure all parts in the whole Asian region except for Japan. 
Indonesia or Thailand is favored for the assembly plant. 
  The Asia car is a car developed especially for the Asian 
market. ASEAN has concluded a reciprocal complementary agreement 
regarding part imports within the region, and using this, they 
will locally procure parts in many nations, assemble and 
manufacture it, and sell it widely in the Asian region. Among 
Japanese carmakers, Nissan Motor considers the "AD Resort," 
which is an improved "AD Van," a special car for Asia, but it 
still does not have a full-scale passenger car "Asia car."

<F P=106> [Kieran Cooke report: "Daring Vision or Time Bomb"] </F>
  The jungle light quickly fades. The rain pounds like a 
hundred machine guns on the roof of the Long Murum longhouse. 
The men, descendants of Borneo's headhunters, their arms and 
legs covered in tattoos, sit round a flickering kerosene lamp. 
They chew betel nut and drink rice wine. Talk is of change and 
development. 
  Here, in the heart of Sarawak, East Malaysia, plans are 
under 
way for South-East Asia's biggest infrastructure project -- a 
M$15bn [Malaysian Dollars] (3.85bn pounds) dam nearly twice the 
height of the Aswan dam in Egypt. 
  The dam, at Bakun a few miles downstream from Long Murum, 
will flood an area larger than Singapore. Long Murum and 14 
other tribal longhouses will disappear. More than 8,000 
tribespeople whose families have lived and hunted in the area 
for generations will be resettled. 
  To some, Bakun is another example of Malaysia's confidence 
in 
the future and a tribute to the daring vision of Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamad. "It's a project whose time has come," said Dr 
Mahathir earlier this year. 
  To others Bakun is an ill conceived scheme of doubtful 
economic merit which could bring environmental disaster to one 
of the world's few remaining areas of tropical rainforest and 
sound the death knell for a unique tribal culture. "It will be 
an ecological time bomb sitting right in the centre of Borneo," 
says Mr Sim Kwang Yang, a Sarawak-based opposition MP. 
  Bakun has been discussed for 14 years but only recently 
given 
the go-ahead by the government. Producing 2,400MW of 
electricity by early next century, the government says Bakun 
will not only meet the needs of Malaysia's fast industrialising 
economy. It will also turn Malaysia into a regional power 
exporter. 
  Bakun poses considerable technical challenges. It is being 
built at a site more than 500km upriver from Sarawak's coast. 
The journey to Bakun involves crossing a number of treacherous 
rapids. New roads will have to be built through dense jungle to 
bring in building materials and engineering equipment. 
  Taking the power out of Bakun will involve even greater 
difficulties. Some of the electricity generated will go to 
Sarawak itself and to the neighbouring Malaysian state of Sabah. 
However, the bulk of the power will go to peninsular Malaysia, 
first by 670km of overhead cables within Sarawak and then 
through 650km of cables under the South China Sea. 
  Experts point out that power transmission through such a 
lengthy underwater cable has never been attempted. "They are 
either being very daring or very foolish," said one Kuala Lumpur 
based energy company executive. Considerable power loss seems 
inevitable. 
  Bakun will be a private sector project. In January this year 
the government signed a memorandum of understanding giving 
management of Bakun to the locally based Ekran company. The 
announcement was greeted with some surprise. There was no 
tendering process involved. 
  Controlled by Mr Ting Pek Khiing, a Sarawak-based Malaysian 
Chinese, Ekran was established only in 1991 and has no 
experience in projects of the size of Bakun. Mr Ting, a 
swashbuckling entrepreneur who has made a name for himself as a 
tourist resort developer, is supremely confident. "We can build 
anything on earth," he says. 
  Mr Ting says between 60 and 70 per cent of financing for 
Bakun will be raised from domestic sources and insists the 
project can be built in six years, without federal or state 
funds. Ekran is widely believed to be backed by Mr Daim 
Zainnudin, a former federal finance minister"and an economic 
adviser to the government. 
  Some tribespeople feel the change the dam will bring is part 
of an inevitable process. "Our ways are altering anyway," says 
Mr John Bampa, who works in the small town of Belaga, close to 
vhe Bakun site. "As children we were taught to hunt wild pig 
and fish. But the new generation have been to school and have 
not been taught the old ways." 
  However, many tribespeople say they have not been consulted 
about Bakun or given any project details. Some reports say a 
series of dams are to be built in the area. In recent years 17 
technical studies have been carried out on Bakun. A government 
minister told parliament this year those documents remain 
classified under Malaysia's official secrets act. 
  Gara Jalong, one of a group of longhouse dwellers who two 
weeks ago tried but failed to present a petition opposing Bakun 
to the Sarawak State Assembly, says a government-appointed 
committee on Bakun does not represent the tribespeople. "Many 
of its members have been responsible for selling our lands to 
the logging companies." 
  Logging is very big business in Sarawak. In the past 
tribespeople who have interfered with the activities of the 
logging companies have been imprisoned. Though Malaysia says it 
is committed to curtailing logging it is still by far the 
world's largest exporter of unprocessed tropical timber most of 
it from Sarawak. 
  Over the last 12 months prices of many tropical hardwoods 
have more than doubled. In a 1991 review of forestry activities 
in Malaysia the World Bank said Sarawak's trees were being cut 
at about four times the sustainable rate -- a judgment fiercely 
denied by the government. Mr Abdul Taib Mahmud has been 
Sarawak's chief minister since 1981. In exchange for support of 
Dr Mahathir's national front coalition government, Sarawak is 
left largely to govern itself. 
  An uncle and political rival of Mr Taib once accused the 
chief minister and his political allies of controlling 30 per 
cent of Sarawak's timber concessions. Two of Mr Taib's sons are 
among Ekran's main shareholders. Mr James Wong, Sarawak's 
environment minister, also controls one of the state's biggest 
timber companies. 
  Bakun is being built on the upper reaches of the Rejang, 
Malaysia's longest river. An area of more than 80,000 hectares 
(200,000 acres), much of it virgin rain forest, will be clear 
cut to accommodate the dam. 
  Environmentalists allege logging has already caused severe 
soil erosion. Locals say ten years ago the Rejang's waters were 
clear and fish were abundant. Now the river, nearly a mile wide 
in places, is a muddy brown colour and there are few fish. 
Water levels fluctuate wildly. 
  The government seems determined that Bakun will go ahead but 
is waiting for Ekran to submit an environmental impact study on 
the project. It has yet to decide whether that study will be 
made public. 
  In the past Dr Mahathir has attacked both local and foreign 
groups that have lobbied on behalf of native peoples: he has 
said such groups would prefer to see the jungle dwellers living 
"like monkeys in trees" instead of sharing in Malaysia's 
development. 
  Lihan Ahang, a native chief at Long Murum, points to a faded 
black and white photograph of his grandfather, a warrior who 
fought against the Brookes, the White Rajahs of Borneo. "We are 
not against development," he says. "But I am sad about this 
project. It means giving up our lands and leaving the graves of 
our ancestors. It means changing our whole way of life."

  [Text] United Nations, May 30 (YONHAP) -- North Korea, 
speeding up the discharge of fuel rods from its 5-megawatt 
nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, had removed 60 percent of the rods 
as of Monday, a source at South Korea's U.N. mission said. 
  A mission official said the information became known after 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported to the 
U.N. Security Council, explaining that "the council's quick 
adoption of a presidential statement reflects the urgent state 
caused by North Korea's fast refueling of the nuclear reactor." 
  Referring to IAEA Director-general Hans Blix's letter on May 
27 to U.N. Secretary-general Butrus Butrus-Ghali, the official 
noted that "only two days remained for that opportunity." In the 
letter, Blix said that if North Korea continued removing fuel at 
the present pace, the chances for selecting, segregating and 
storing the discharged rods for later IAEA measurement would be 
lost in a few days. 
  Accordingly, the North Korean nuclear crisis is expected to 
reach a critical stage in the middle of this week. It is also 
anticipated that the Security Council would take follow-up 
action such as adopting a resolution warning of economic 
sanctions if Pyongyang continued discharging the fuel rods.

  [Text] If North Korea does not stop the work of replacing 
the fuel rods within two to three days, the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] made a final conclusion that the 
transparency of North Korea's nuclear issue cannot be verified. 
The IAEA plans to make an additional report on this to the UN 
Security Council [UNSC] sometime this weekend. Following is a 
report by Cha Man-sun from Vienna. 
  [Begin Cha Man-sun recording] The IAEA believes that the 
statement on North Korea, which was urgently adopted at the UNSC 
today, will stimulate the resolution of the fuel rods issue, and 
anticipates a positive response from North Korea. However, if 
North Korea does not show a positive response in two to three 
days by immediately suspending the work to replace the fuel 
rods, a decisive opportunity to take samples will be lost. 
  Currently, the work to replace the fuel rods is being 
carried 
out at a very quick pace with the presence of two inspectors, 
and it seems that over 4,000 of the 8,000 fuel rods will be 
replaced in two to three days. 
  Therefore, if North Korea does not immediately implement the 
UNSC's demand, the IAEA will make a final decision saying that 
it has reached a stage in which it cannot verify the 
transparency of North Korea's nuclear issue, and then report 
this to the UNSC sometime this weekend to urge that additional 
measures on North Korea be taken. 
  The two inspectors who are in Yongbyon reported that the 
work 
to replace the fuel rods has reached a limit in which it is 
difficult to take samples, and that if the work to replace the 
fuel rods was stopped, there would be no safety problem at all 
at the atomic reactor. [end recording]

<F P=106> [YONHAP from Berlin] </F>
  [Text] In order to confirm the operational history of the 
reactor in Yongbyon, the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] on 31 May suggested technological methods to the North 
Korean side, but the North Korean side pointed out that it is 
already storing fuel rods taken from the reactor in Yongbyon 
according to its own standards in a bid to prepare for later 
measurement by the IAEA. 
  The IAEA revealed that confirmation of the location of fuel 
rods required for later measurement is impossible with the North 
Korean side's method of storing fuel rods, and suggested 
technological methods that would enable confirmation of whether 
nuclear material was converted or not. 
  To this, Yun Ho-chin, councilor in the North Korean Embassy 
in Vienna, suggested that North Korea will continue replacing 
fuel rods. However, he stressed that North Korea did not mix 
the fuel rods after taking them out at random [mujakchong], but 
that the locations and serial numbers of fuel rods have been 
clearly recorded before a surveillance camera and the fuel rods 
have been kept in a covered [chapye] water tank. 
  Meanwhile, Hans Meyer, a spokesman of the IAEA, said that in 
the event that North Korea continues the replacement of fuel 
rods, in a few days, the IAEA will come to a point where it will 
not be able to analyze the history of operation of Yongbyon 
reactor

  [Text] Berlin, May 31 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] said Tuesday it has proposed that North 
Korea take technical action that would enable the IAEA to 
confirm the history of reactor operations at Yongbyon despite 
the fact that Pyongyang's replacement of fuel rods has already 
passed the halfway mark. North Korea, however, announced that 
it has selected and stored spent fuel rods taken from the 
5-megawatt reactor according to certain standards in an effort 
to guarantee future measurement of the rods. 
  The IAEA emphasized that it could not accept North Korea's 
method because it would not be able to confirm the location of 
the fuel rods, which is necessary for future measurement. 
Without confirming where the spent fuel rods had been located, 
the agency could not determine whether the North Koreans had 
diverted nuclear material, according to an IAEA announcement. 
  Yun Ho-jin, counselor at the North Korean Embassy in Vienna, 
stressed that the refueling is proceeding and "it should not be 
stopped." 
  Yun added, "we are not shuffling the spent fuel rods 
discharged from the reactor but putting them, 40 at a time, into 
a radioactivity-proof tank after writing the location and serial 
numbers on the rods, with monitoring cameras operating." 
  Therefore, when the nuclear problem is solved through a 
package deal between Pyongyang and Washington, the IAEA can find 
necessary fuel rods based on the records and measure them, he 
said. 
  The IAEA wants to take 300 fuel rod samples from 30 fuel rod 
channels, Yun explained, and has demanded that North Korea 
segregate and secure 10 fuel rod bundles per channel. 
  North Korea, however, is putting 40 fuel rods from four 
channels into a case, increasing the number of sample fuel rods 
to 1,200, Yun said. 
  "The IAEA is actually demanding that North Korea accept ad 
hoc and routine inspections," he said. "We can never accept 
this demand, considering our special position that we reserved 
our decision to withdraw from the nuclear nonproliferation 
treaty (NPT)." 
  Meanwhile, IAEA Spokesman Hans Meyer confirmed that North 
Korea had not stopped replacing fuel rods in spite of a 
statement by the president of the UN Security Council. 
  He expected that the refueling would reach a critical point 
in one or two days, after which the IAEA could no longer analyze 
the history of the reactor's operations. 
  The UN Security Council Tuesday adopted a presidential 
statement demanding that North Korea comply with IAEA safeguards.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
editorials and articles carried by ROK vernacular newspapers on 
1 June commenting on the UN Security Council presidential 
statement on the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Conservative CHOSON ILBO on page 3 carries a 1,000-word 
editorial entitled "Though Another Presidential Statement Has 
Been Released...." which starts out by saying that this 
statement is a "very soft statement," then notes that "North 
Korea is unlikely to comply with this statement" and that "this 
may have merely added an ace card to North Korea's hand of 
nuclear cards." Pointing out that "the stronger the North 
Korean position, the more carrots the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA], the ROK, the United States, and the United 
Nations have offered," it concludes by saying: "Even if the 
international community imposes sanctions on North Korea, North 
Korea, which is enjoying the nuclear game, is not expected to 
promptly change its attitude. Also, if the international 
community tries to resolve the issue through negotiations even 
while going in the direction of sanctions, North Korea will try 
to take ill advantage of this, as well. Therefore, resolving 
the nuclear issue requires our side's resolute will." 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries a 1,000-word editorial on 
page 3 entitled "Quickened Pace at the Security Council." The 
editorial first describes the background of the UN Security 
Council's adoption of the presidential statement and notes that 
"if North Korea refused to accept the UN Security Council's 
presidential statement, the Security Council will, unavoidably, 
pursue sanctions." It then says that "we cannot accept any 
negotiations in which North Korea's past nuclear activities will 
be overlooked" and that "the carrots that will be available to 
North Korea once the North Korean nuclear issue is resolved 
diplomatically have already been made public." The editorial 
finally expresses the hope that "North Korea will make a wise 
choice." 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries a 1,000-word 
article 
by correspondent Chong Yon-chu in Washington on page 3 entitled 
"Sanctions Will Be Inevitable If North Korea Continues To 
Replace Fuel Rods." The article starts out by saying that the 
adopted presidential statement is likely to lead to the 
resumption of negotiations between North Korea and the IAEA, and 
that it is speculated that North Korea may stop short of 
replacing fuel rods at the last moment. The article then notes 
that if North Korea should continuee to replace fuel rods, "this 
should be interpreted as North Korea's determination not to 
disclose its 'nuclear past' at all costs." 
  Moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries a 1,200-word article by 
reporter Kang Yong-chin on page 3 entitled "Government's 
Measures on the North Korean Nuclear Issue." 
  The articles says the ROK Government is busy mapping out 
measures as the uncertainty over the North Korean nuclear issue 
increases and is even examining the possibility of imposing 
sanctions against North Korea by the ROK, the United States, and 
Japan if North Korea refuses to resolve the nuclear issue 
through dialogue and if international sanctions are not possible 
because of China's veto at the UN Security Council. It also 
says that even though it considers military sanctions to be 
undesirable, the ROK Government is looking into possible 
measures should the United Nations or the United States choose 
to impose military sanctions. 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,000-word 
article by Kim Su-chong, the correspondent at UN Headquarters. 
The article points out that "China's flexible position made it 
possible for the UN Security Council to adopt the presidential 
statement immediately," and quotes a Chinese diplomat as saying 
"China is concerned about the possible situation to be resulted 
from the rupture of North Korea-U.S. talks if North Korea 
continues hurried replacement of fuel rods." 
  The article says that "without any concrete countermeasures 
against the North Korean nuclear issue, the United States seems 
to expect that the presidential statement of the UN Security 
Council will induce Chinese influence upon North Korea as well 
as urge it to accede to dialogue." 
  The article concludes by noting the possibility that "North 
Korea will break through the crisis caused by its fuel rods 
replacement by using its unique tactic," and saying: "North 
Korea has used a hide- and-seek tactic. While driving the 
nuclear issue to a critical phase, North Korea has strung the 
United States along by offering dialogue whenever the UN 
Security Council was going to take measures against it." 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 a 900-word 
article by New York and Washington-based correspondents Pak 
Su-man and Yi Chong-yon. After explaining the background of the 
adoption of the recent UN statement on North Korea, the article 
reports that "the IAEA's abandonment of negotiations and the 
abrupt adoption of the UN Security Council president's statement 
on the North Korean nuclear issue has made the prospect of 
U.S.-North Korea dialogue very cloudy." 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 5 a 900-word 
article by Washington-based correspondent Yi Kyong-hyong. The 
article stresses the following three points as being significant 
in the adoption of the UN statement on North Korea: First, the 
statement "supports the IAEA position on future measurement of 
nuclear fuel rods;" second, the implication in the statement 
that "the UN Security Council's will to take immediate follow-up 
measures, such as sanctions, if North Korea rejects the future 
measurement of fuel rods;" and third, the promptness shown in 
adopting the statement. It stresses that this reflects the UN 
Security Council's recognition that "the issue of replacing 
North Korea's fuel rods is an imminent problem in need of a 
speedy solution." 
  Regarding China's position, the article cites experts' 
analysis that "in view of smoothed relations with the United 
States, China will take great account of the fact that the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula complies with its own 
interests." Quoting diplomatic sources in the United Nations 
and Washington, the article also reports that China will 
"inactively participate" in taking possible follow-up measures 
against North Korea.

  [Text] Zhang Tingyan, PRC Ambassador to the ROK, said that 
China also supports the statement adopted by the UN Security 
Council yesterday regarding the North Korean nuclear issue, thus 
stressing that there are no changes in China's position of 
supporting a denuclerization on the Korean peninsula. 
  At a lecture arranged by a Graduate School of the Business 
Administration of Korea University this morning, Ambassador 
Zhang stressed that China's position that North Korea should not 
possess nuclear weapons remains unchanged, and that China is 
making efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Ambassador Zhang said that the North Korean nuclear issue 
should not be resolved by force of arms, but that he hopes that 
it can be peacefully resolved through dialouge. 
  He added that although North Korea is in a very difficult 
situation due to its economic difficulties, he expects that it 
will gradually carry out an opening up policy.

  [Text] It is noteworthy to note that it appears that North 
Korea will actively oppose Russia's participation in the 
Nonaligned Movement's [NAM] meeting and demand that the articles 
on the U.S.- DPRK talks and on implementing the International 
Atomic Energy Agency's safeguards accord be eliminated in the 
content of the draft of the final declaration, at the 11th 
nonaligned foreign ministers' meeting, which is to begin on 31 
May. 
  North Korea, which is dispatching a 16-man delegation 
including Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam, is strongly opposing 
Russia from joining the nonaligned meeting by saying that it 
runs counter to the ideology of the nonaligned meeting. 
  Among the content of the draft of the final declaration, 
North Korea will request the elimination on the part on the 
U.S.-DPRK talks and on implementing the nuclear safeguards 
accord. It is strengthening diplomatic activities with 
nonaligned countries.

  [Text] Grigoriy Karasin, spokesman of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry, said on 31 May that Russia and North Korea had agreed 
to allow North Korean workers working at timber logging camps in 
Siberia, Russia, to separately and freely carry their passports 
in the future. 
  In a regular briefing held that day, Spokesman Karasin said 
that during the third Russia-North Korea negotiations to revise 
an agreement on the forestry cooperation held in Pyongyang from 
14 to 24 May, working-level delegates from both Russia and North 
Korea had agreed to allow the North Korean loggers to carry 
their passports in Russia so that they can immediately show them 
to Russian officials when they are asked to show identification. 
  This indicates that the North Korean loggers can freely 
travel throughout Russia, as well as go outside of Russia if 
they want. It can be, therefore, regarded as important progress 
for their human rights. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry has said that all foreigners, 
who legally stay in Russia with proper documents, can freely 
travel to third countries if they have done nothing contrary to 
the law, such as committing criminal acts in Russia. 
  North Korean authorities who have managed the timber camps 
in 
Siberia thusfar, have kept their loggers' passports all together 
and instead issued certificates that can only be used within the 
camps. This has served as an important factor in keeping them 
from travelling freely. 
  Spokesman Karasin also said that the delegates from the two 
countries agreed to include a special regulation which specifies 
that the North Korean workers shall work according to the 
Russian law and its working-hour system in their new agreement 
on forestry cooperation.

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Song-hun, professor of industrial economics </F>
at Chungang University in Seoul] 
  [Text] There have recently been a series of relevant 
testimonies by North Korean defectors and also a news report 
about President Kim Il-song's request to a foreign country for 
food aid. With this as momentum, the widespread rumor about 
North Korea's difficulties in food supply has turned out to be 
true, thereby arousing the general public's great interest. 
Because we also had much difficulty at one time in the 
seventies and in the early eighties, we all know well that North 
Korea's food shortage is not of the nature that we can just 
gloat over. This is because that issue is, rather than the one 
that should be seen from a political or military viewpoint, a 
prerequisite to the maintenance and development of human 
survival and is a task that should be solved together with a 
compatriotic love. 
  This notwithstanding, the statistics about food are still a 
secret to the outside in North Korea. We are at a loss on how 
to help because the truth cannot be known, and the reality is 
that we cannot do anything because we might touch a sensitive 
matter of taboo. 
<H5>  The Food Situation in North Korea Veiled in Mystery </H5>
  The only official statistics about North Korea's food 
situation is the record of production of food crops which North 
Korea is reporting on a regular basis to the United Nations Food 
and Agriculture Organization [FAO] every year. It is 
internationally acknowledged that the reliability of this report 
is that it is only for reference. To sum up the data reported 
to FAO, as seen in table one, North Korea recorded grain 
production in 1992 at a level similar to that of 1991. In terms 
of roughly refined grain, the production break-down follows: 5.8 
million tonnes of rice (4.18 million tonnes in terms of finely 
refined rice--about 29 million sok [one sok equals about 5.12 
U.S. bushels]); 200,000 tonnes of wheat; 4.5 million tonnes of 
corn; 460,000 tonnes of beans; and 200,000 tonnes of barley and 
others grains. The volume of all these total as much as 11 
million tonnes in terms of roughly refined grain production. 
This is an enormous volume amounting to about eight million 
tonnes in terms of finely refined grains. Even without the 
volume of 2.5 million tonnes of potatoes, including sweet 
potatoes, this means that North Korea has already been in a 
chronic glut of food crops. But, the grain production volume of 
North Korea is too high when compared with 1992's grain 
production of no more than 5.97 million tonnes in South Korea 
which has many more rice paddy fields than the North--though the 
size of the total arable land of South and North Korea is 
roughly the same. In other words, this means that North Korea's 
per capita grain consumption is as much as 365 kg -- 65 kg more 
than the maximum average volume an adult can consume annually. 
Even considering its stockpiles for an emergency, North Korea, 
with a population of 23 million people ought to have exported 
annually about 1.5 million tonnes of grains over the past two or 
three years. 
  In terms of finely refined grains, aside from rice, this 
means that every person of North Korea's whole population 
consumed about 182 kg of rice in 1992 thanks to that year's 
production of as much as 4.176 million tonnes (29 million sok), 
a 13.7 percent increase over 1983 when the production was no 
more than 3.672 million tonnes (25.5 million sok). This amount 
is as much as 70 kg more than South Korea's per capita 
consumption of about 182 kg the same year. Considering that 
North Korea is producing annually as much as 4.5 million tonnes 
(as reported to FAO) of corn, its second most important food 
staple next to rice, this is construed as meaning that rice, its 
primary food staple, is in rampant excess everywhere in North 
Korea. 
  Therefore, the details of North Korea's food statistics 
which 
are veiled in mystery are incoherent. The FAO is quite at a 
loss as to this data under the circumstances in which it has to 
compile and make public such statistics about grain production. 
Even if the organization dispatches an investigator to North 
Korea, then, it would also face the difficulty of making a 
confirmation. Thus, it is just printing out annual reports as 
received. 
  Under these circumstances, we can never expect anyone, if he 
is not an expert, to make a comparative analysis as seen above. 
On the contrary, most of amateurish North Korea researchers are 
faced with a dilemma in this regard. They cannot but trust FAO 
statistics, and cannot, either, flatly negate news reports about 
North Korea's food shortage. By the way, an event, which can be 
said to be "revolutionary," took place inside FAO this year. 
FAO has made public statistics about 1993's food 
production--though tentative--, about which official reports 
have not been compiled yet, on the basis of an estimate which is 
calculated to be 22.4 percent lower than 1992. FAO made public 
data of rice production by lowering the volume by 33 percent. 
  Statistics compiled by ROK research institutes are also 
different from one another, and have only added to the confusion 
because they differ from data compiled by U.S. CIA's satellites. 
  In order to avoid such confusion, the National Unification 
Board [NUB] has recently had the Office of Rural Development 
experiment in doing farming as patterned after the reality in 
North Korea, thereby making public data for a general study, 
which are relatively close to the reality. 
  Therefore, according to the "present status of North Korea's 
economic situation" compiled and released by the NUB on 21 
August, 1993, with the help of a relevant agency, North Korea's 
gross grain production, in terms of finely refined grains, was 
4.81 million tonnes in 1990; 4.43 million tonnes in 1991; 4.27 
million tonnes in 1992; and 3.88 million tonnes in 1993, showing 
a large gradual decrease. Outwardly, these figures show a 
remarkable difference in annual production by about as much as 
3.5 million tonnes from North Korea's report to FAO. 
  According to the estimated statistical figures released 
by the NUB, in 1991-1992 alone North Korea was short of at least 
1.3 million-2.3 million tonnes of provisions. Meanwhile, 
according to the recent data released by the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development and the International 
Monetary Fund (CHOSON ILBO dated 29 April 1994), North Korea 
imported 649,000 tonnes of grains from China and 177,000 tonnes 
from Turkey during 1992. In addition to this, North Korea also 
seems to have imported 250,000 tonnes of grains secretly from 
the United States during the same year. In other words, this 
means that North Korea imported a total of slightly over one 
million tonnes during 1992. 
  However, the estimated amount of North Korea's harvest in 
1993 showed a shortfall of 400,000 tonnes over 1992. As a result 
of this, it is apparent that North Korea's food situation in 
1993-1994 has become more serious. In view of such a situation 
we cannot sternly say that some North Korean defectors' remarks 
revealing that even some stockpiled rice for military use was 
released and supplied to civilians as an emergency step and that 
it has become impossible even to take such a step now are 
totally groundless. Now North Korea also suffers from a shortage 
in foreign currency and so, it cannot afford to purchase for 
cash grain from foreign countries. It has relied only on its 
import of grant-type grains from China. 
  With the recent increase in the number of North Koreans who 
are escaping from North Korea via China and Russia it has become 
no longer possible for North Korea to conceal its food shortage. 
Furthermore, in recent years North Korea has begun to almost 
openly purchase grains from foreign countries in an effort to 
maintain stability in its political system in the wake of the 
power transfer to the Kim Chong-il system. 
  Until 1990 North Korea had carried out trade on a barter 
system with China by giving rice to China and taking corn of 
greater quantities of its rice from it. However, afterward North 
Korea began purchasing in earnest rice and corn from Thailand, 
the United States, Canada, Australia, and Turkey. However, as 
mentioned above, North Korea has relied on imports of grains 
mainly from China since 1992. 
<H5>  North Korea's failure in agriculture is caused by its </H5>
political system 
  In 1991 and 1992 the North Korean authorities reported to 
the 
FAO that they had achieved a bumper crop in these years. 
However, the food situation in these years and in 1993 was so 
bad that food was not distributed to residents on time and that 
collective resistance took place in some regions as a result. 
  In sum, it is evident that North Korea's food situation has 
become more serious particularly in recent years, and the 
people's complaints are mounting. Riced corn, which is made of 
corn flour, has appeared as a rice substitute, and corn noodle 
appeared as a wheat noodle substitute. Even noodle mixed with 
powdered herb roots and tree bark has appeared in North Korea 
today. 
  Chinese and Korean residents in China should bring their own 
food and foodstuffs with them when visiting North Korea. People 
carrying flour bags on their heads or backs are a common sight 
at border check points. 
  The main cause for the worsening agricultural and food 
situation of North Korae lies in the natural, physical, and 
technological restrictions in North Korea. 
  As Karl Marx said, "the productivity of agricultural labor 
is 
closely linked to natural conditions." In view of this, North 
Korea is definitely unfavorable than South Korea in terms of 
natural and physical farm conditions. However, we cannot say 
that North Korea is unfavorable compared to the three provinces 
of Northeast China which are located north of North Korea. 
  Therefore, the natural and physical factors cannot become 
the main cause of North Korea's agricultural failure. Denmark's 
agriculture which has developed by cultivating a desert, 
Israel's agriculture which has been built on swamps and barren 
land, Switzerland's agriculture on mountain-side terraced 
fields, and Netherlands' agriculture on the sea have created a 
miracle and evoked the world people's admiration despite their 
unfavorable conditions. 
  The main cause of the low productivity of North Korea's 
agriculture should be found in the shortcoming of its 
agricultural management system. In other words, the problem of 
North Korea's agriculture lies in its centralized planned 
economy which cannot properly adapt itself to the rapidly 
changing natural, environmental conditions and in its uniform, 
collectivist economic system. It is difficult to expect a 
substantial technological revolution in agriculture through 
North Korea's present system of ownership by all of the people 
and its collectivist cooperative system of agriculture --which 
have ended in failure in former socialist countries--and through 
the repeated emphasis of the so-called chuche farming method. 
In particular, it is also difficult to whip up the production 
will of farmers by repeatedly stressing the ideological 
revolution and the cultural revolution among them without giving 
incentives to their production efforts as we see in the 
capitalist economy. 
<H5>  Agricultural exchange between the North and the South is </H5>
urgently needed 
  North Korea has relatively favorable circumstances and 
conditions in solving the basic problem of its "continuous 
poverty." In the early seventies, North Korea's potential 
strength surpassed that of the South Korean economy. In other 
words, North Korea's foundation for material growth and human 
capability, that is, its labor force, cannot be underestimated 
even today. North Korean agriculture's scientific and 
technological level of is not inferior to that of any developing 
countries. North Korea's plant breeding and farm cultivation 
technology, too, have reached a considerable level. The 
foundation for mechanization of the production system of 
chemical fertilizer, as well, are fairly good. The problem is, 
however, that a key mechanism which can combine these factors 
into one and vitalize them, is necessary. In other words, this 
means that an incentive sysrem based on the market economics 
should be introduced. 
  In light of the fact that the rate of self-sufficiency in 
food supply in South Korea remains at the 30 percent level and 
that agriculture is the most vulnerable field of the South 
Korean economy, it is necessary for the North and the South to 
seek mutual cooperation in agriculture, including the exchange 
of agricultural technology and capital. 
  The most serious problem in South Korea's agriculture is 
that 
it is losing international competitiveness in the prices of 
agricultural products due to the high prices of agricultural 
labor forces and the increase in land prices. In other words, 
the only problem that South Korea is faced with today despite 
the fact that it has capital, technology, plants, and 
high-standard agricultural labor forces, is the lack of 
international competitiveness in the prices of agricultural 
products. 
  Such being the situation, strengthening cooperation in 
agriculture with North Korea which has basic material and human 
foundations for agricultural development can, I believe, open a 
new horizen in South Korea's agriculture.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Robert Gallucci, ambassador in </F>
charge of nuclear issues of the U.S. State Department and head 
of the U.S. delegation for the U.S.-DPRK high-ranking talks, by 
Washington correspondent Chong Yon-chu at Gallucci's office in 
the State Department building on 26 May, Korean time] 
  [Text] [Chong Yon-chu] The DPRK-U.S. working-level contact 
started in New York at 1100. What results do you think will be 
achieved? 
  [Robert Gallucci] As you know, it is not customary to reveal 
the content of the New York working-level contact (the DPRK-U.S. 
New York contact which started at 1100 lasted six hours). At the 
recent New York contact held early this week, we conveyed our 
opinion on holding the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks and the 
replacement of the fuel rods which is currently an issue. I hope 
that an agreement can be reached very soon on the third round of 
talks, and that North Korea will take corresponding measures 
regarding the demands by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] which are necessary in having an understanding of how the 
atomic reactor was operated in the past through further 
measurements of its fuel rods. 
  [Chong] At a recent special briefing at the State 
Department, 
you made an optimistic and encouraging remark on holding the 
third round of talks. What is the prospects for the third round 
of talks? 
  [Gallucci] We are prepared to hold the third round of talks 
as soon as possible. We also notified North Korea on several 
occasions on the basis for holding the third round of talks. 
Now that basis has been provided. North Korea accepted the 
nuclear safety measures revealed at the 31 March statement by 
the chairman of the UN Security Council, and finished additional 
inspection [chuga sachal] on the radiochemical laboratory, which 
was not completed in March, and follow-up inspection [husok 
sachal] necessary in maintaining surveillance equipment. In 
addition, there was no diversion of nuclear material in the fuel 
rods extracted from the atomic reactor. Therefore, considering 
the current situation, the basis for the third round of talks 
has been provided and, thus, we are prepared to hold the third 
round of talks. 
  However, one point that we have to bear in mind is that a 
precondition for the United States to continue talks with North 
Korea is that North Korea must accept the demands by the IAEA to 
guarantee further measurements on the fuel rods which were 
extracted. If an agreement is not reached soon on selecting, 
separating, and storing the sample of the fuel rods as demanded 
by the IAEA, and thus it is impossible to carry out further 
measurement, not only will the basis for the dialogue disappear, 
but this issue will be directly handed over to the UN Security 
Council. Therefore, considering the current situation, there are 
both positive and negative elements. On the one hand, we are 
faced with the third round of talks characterized as extensive 
and thorough talks, while on the other hand, it is being 
regarded that issues to be agreed upon between North Korea and 
the IAEA are being regarded as a time bomb. This time bomb is 
not ticking on our side but it is ticking from the North Korean 
side. This is because if North Korea wants, it can stop it from 
ticking any time it wants. 
  [Chong] You said that an early agreement must be reached. 
How much time do you think it will take before the situation 
aggravates, in which the expression, time bomb, is used? 
  [Gallucci] How quickly the situation aggravates will be 
dependent on how quickly and in what pattern North Korea 
extracts the fuel rods. If it postpones the replacement of the 
fuel rods and agrees to the selection, separation, and storage 
of the necessary samples in further measurements, the time bomb 
can be stopped. 
  [Chong] Is the work to replace the fuel rods not being 
conducted under the surveillance of the IAEA? 
  [Gallucci] Yes. Not only is the inspection conducted by two 
to three team members on the spot at the atomic reactor, but it 
is also conducted under the surveillance of the "storage 
surveillance" equipment which consists of a spent fuel measuring 
instrument and monitoring camera that shows when the spent fuel 
was extracted and moved to the storage water tank. 
  [Chong] What are the prospects for discussing the issue of 
normalizing relations between the DPRK and the United States at 
the third round of talks? 
  [Gallucci] If the nuclear issue is resolved, relations 
between the two countries will be able to move toward a more 
normal relationship. We hope that this will be achieved. 
  [Chong] Please explain in detail what you mean by "a more 
normal relationship." 
  [Gallucci] There are various models in normalizing a 
relationship. I hope that you paid attention to which model the 
United States chose in pursuing the normalization of relations 
with Vietnam recently, and which channel the United States chose 
in the past to normalize relations with China. If North Korea 
resolves its nuclear issue, we will take corresponding measures. 
  [Chong] Looking at the experiences with Vietnam and China, 
normalizing the relationships started with the opening of 
liaison offices. 
  [Gallucci] I believe that it is important to resolve issues 
of interest of the both sides amid the framework of gradually 
improving relations by taking simultaneous measures. I repeat 
that the third round of talks is a place to extensively and 
thoroughly discuss all political and economic issues of interest. 
  [Chong] North Korea has been showing much interest in 
introducing the light-water atomic reactor. If North Korea 
introduces does this, it will be able to erase doubts regarding 
the development of nuclear weapons. To what degree can the 
United States help North Korea in giving a technological head 
start to the light-water reactor? 
  [Gallucci] North Korea requested such help at the second 
round of talks held in Geneva last year. We positively accepted 
North Korea's proposal. We also said that we are prepared to 
give help to North Korea so that it can have technology to 
change into light- water reactor with the international 
community. 
  [Chong] However, is it not true that there is in reality a 
limit in giving such help in your domestic law? 
  [Gallucci] Assisting North Korea to introduce the 
light-water reactor is dependent on whether the nuclear issue is 
resolved. Even if we gave help to North Korea, it does not mean 
that we would give Westing House's and General Electric's 
light-water atomic reactor. There are always ways to give help 
and avoiding practical restrictions. Other than the United 
States, there are many countries including France, Germany, 
Japan, and Russia that have light-water reactors. There are 
many countries that can give financial help to North Korea as 
well. 
  [Chong] There are various views within the U.S. 
Administration on North Korea's nuclear capability. Why are 
there different viewpoints on the same information? 
  [Gallucci] This is because the information is incomplete. 
To our knowledge, there is an enormous uncertainty in the 
content North Korea notified to the IAEA. North Korea notified 
that plutonium was extracted according to the gram unit, but 
according to the analysis based on the samples extracted by the 
IAEA inspection team, there is a possibility that, in reality, 
North Korea may possess plutonium according to the kilogram 
unit. There is an "inconsistency" between the notified quantity 
and the actual analysis. We cannot explain this inconsistency 
with the current evidence. Therefore, it was necessary to 
conduct a special inspection [tukpyol sachal]. This means that 
North Korea may possess plutonium according to the kilogram 
unit. However, that evidence is not decisive. 
  Nuclear materials such as plutonium and enriched uranium are 
not enough to manufacture nuclear weapons. There must be a 
"triggering system," a system which makes nuclear materials 
explode with energy. This triggering system requires time and 
expertise. Because of this, there are different opinions on 
whether North Korea truly has only nuclear materials or whether 
it also possesses a triggering system necessary to manufacture 
nuclear weapons. Therefore, there are different opinions on the 
degree of North Korea's nuclear capability. 
  [Chong] Exactly one year has passed since the first round of 
talks. Looking back at the past year, how can you assess the 
year before and now? 
  [Gallucci] There are both positive and negative aspects. 
During the past year, the nuclear safeguard measures on North 
Korea's nuclear facilities were maintained; North Korea did not 
extract even one gram of plutonium; there were nuclear 
inspections on several occasions; and North Korea is still under 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty system. These are the 
positive aspects of the past year. There is also a negative 
aspect which is that no concrete progress was made. In other 
words, we do not know how much plutonium was actually extracted 
and we were not able to clearly examine the "inconsistency" 
discovered by the IAEA. In a nutshell, there are aspects in 
which to have hope for, but there are also aspects that are 
dangerous.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Kang Yong-won] </F>
  [Text] It was learned on 31 May that the 1.0195 trillion 
won-scale Piho Project which is now being carried out by the ROK 
Army and the ROK Air Force (30 mm anti-aircraft self-propelled 
artillery project) encounters many problems. In other words, 
the electronic optical tracing device which was developed in the 
United States has many problems, including a defective sight 
adjuster while firing. 
  It was also learned that our Navy's P-3C antisubmarine 
control aircraft project, too, which is scaled at 620 billion 
won, had to pay the U.S. manufacturing company $93 million to 
recover its discontinued production line. The production line 
was already discontinued when the project was initiated. At 
that time our authorities failed to confirm if the company had 
discontinued the production line because they lacked the 
capability of collecting sufficient information on the U.S. 
company. 
  These facts were revealed in an "Inspection White Paper" 
released by the Ministry of National Defense [MND] on 31 May 
after inspecting eight ongoing projects, including the 
antisubmarine control aircraft project and the Sangmu project, 
from January to March this year. 
  It is the first time that the MND released the results of 
its special inspection of these projects under the Yulgok 
Project in the form of a white paper. This white paper was 
released in accordance with the promise that Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae made at the time of the MND's initiation of the 
special inspection. 
  In the case of the antisubmarine control aircraft project, 
the white paper indicated that our side had to pay the U.S. 
Lockheed Company, the P-3C antisubmarine control aircraft's 
manufacturing company, extra money to recovering its already 
suspended production line, thereby resulting in wasting our 
budget. 
  The white paper revealed that the U.S. Lockheed Company had 
announced the suspension of the production of antisubmarine 
control aircraft in 1990. Our side had to submit itself to the 
burden of paying money to recover the suspended production line. 
This was because our authorities concerned lacked the 
capability of collecting information.

    [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 28 May 
publish editorials, reports, and articles on President Clinton's 
decision to renew China's MFN status. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,000-word 
editorial entitled "The Recovery of U.S.-PRC Relations." Noting 
that the United States decided to seek "practical interests" 
instead of "moral obligations" on the human rights issue by 
renewing China's MFN status, the editorial says that the 
solution of this problem, which might possibly have caused not 
only "tension" in relations between the United States and China, 
but also a "negative impact" in the Northeast Asian situation, 
is very "fortunate." Explaining the background of granting MFN 
trading status to China, the editorial stresses that if 
U.S.-China relations were to be strained by the withdrawal of 
MFN status, "dark clouds" would be cast on the overall situation 
in East Asia. The editorial points to China's "important role" 
in the region, including a role as "mediator" for a solution to 
the North Korean nuclear issue. The editorial assesses that 
President Clinton's recent decision is a "positive step" for 
U.S.- China relations and for the overall situation in the 
region. The editorial adds that U.S. human rights diplomacy 
"has not retreated" because China itself is showing "gradual 
improvement" on the issue and is being watched not only by the 
United States but also by the entire world. 
  The editorial predicts, however, that with the United 
States' 
"invigorated advance" into Chinese markets, ROK exports to China 
would accordingly suffer a blow. Nevertheless, the editorial 
predicts that in the long term, "stability" in East Asia and the 
promotion of ROK-PRC relations will even "broaden" Chinese 
markets for ROK commodities. In conclusion, the editorial 
expresses hope that since China has acquired a "concession" from 
the United States, China will play a role in resolving the North 
Korean nuclear problem as demanded by the international 
community. 
  TONG-A ILBO also publishes on page 7 a 1,000-word article by 
Washington-based correspondent Nam Chan-sun under the headline, 
"Human Rights Policy Pushed Aside by Seeking Practical 
Interest." Describing the U.S. decision to renew China's MFN 
status as "the last resort," the article points out that the 
United States can no longer "ignore" the political and economic 
"influence" exerted by China and that "economic retaliation" 
against the United States by China if the MFN status had not 
been renewed would have a serious impact on the U.S. economy. 
The article notes, however, that with the recent decision to 
renew MFN status, domestic criticism of the U.S. 
administration's "appeasement foreign policy" will certainly 
"expand." 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 5 a 
1,300-word article by Washington-based correspondent Yi 
Chong-yon, entitled "The Choice of Practical 'Economic Profits' 
Rather than 'Human Rights.'" Explaining the background of 
granting MFN status to China, the article points out that 
various "interested organizations" in the United States, 
including large U.S. business groups that advanced into China, 
demanded that President Clinton put an end to "diplomatic 
friction" with China over human rights because it is believed 
that heightened U.S.-China "diplomatic tensions" will be "more 
unfavorable" for the United States than for China. The article 
views that the U.S. decision for renewal was prompted by the 
Chinese Government's "hardline" position on opposing U.S. policy 
to link China's human rights with the renewal of MFN status, and 
by the "inevitability" of the U.S. "appeasement diplomatic 
policy" toward China in its efforts to resolve the North Korean 
nuclear issue, which is the greatest "diplomatic headache" 
facing the Clinton Administration, by asking China to exercise 
influence on North Korea for a solution to the nuclear issue. 
  Pointing to "strong criticism" raised by "progressive 
pressure organizations" within the United States on the Clinton 
Administration's "inconsistent human rights policy," the article 
says that President Clinton may have to revise his human rights 
policy toward Asia, and concludes that the recent MFN renewal 
step for China has certainly caused "damage" to U.S. "diplomatic 
prestige." 
  The moderate daily HANGUK ILBO on page 6 publishes articles 
by Washington-based correspondent Yi Sang-sok and by 
Beijing-based correspondent Yu Tong-hui on "impressions" in the 
United States and China seen after the decision to renew China's 
MFN status. Concerning the U.S. "impressions", the article 
points out that this decision has caused an "enormous shock" in 
both official and civilian quarters within the United States, 
because this decision is not merely for the "extension" of the 
status, but signifies an "epoch-making" step in U.S. Government 
policy not to link human rights with trade any longer. The 
article explains in detail a few points that made President 
Clinton change the policy, including the U.S. "economy 
first-policy" and the inevitability of regarding China as a 
"regional partner" for maintaining stability in Asia. Pointing 
to the "immediate criticism" of President Clinton's decision by 
U.S. human rights organizations and some U.S. congressmen, the 
article notes that contrary to this, U.S. business circles 
"heaved a sigh of relief" and expressed satisfaction with the 
possibility of increasing exports to the Chinese markets. 
  Concerning the Chinese side's "impressions", the article 
notes that China "welcomed" the U.S. decision and accepted it as 
a "wise decision." The article writes, however, that China 
predicts that in an attempt to appease criticism within the 
United States for President Clinton's "violation of his election 
pledges," the President will demand "greater economic 
concessions" from the Chinese side. 
  The moderate SEOUL MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN on page 6 
publishes a 1,300-word article by Washington-based correspondent 
Kim Kyong-su entitled "U.S. Choice of Practical Interest--the 
Background of U.S. Renewal of MFN Status for China." Explaining 
the background of the U.S. decision, the article views that 
"trade relations" between the two countries was "a decisive 
factor" for drawing this conclusion, and notes that U.S. exports 
to China have tripled over the past 10 years and China has 
become the seventh largest trade partner of the United States. 
Another factor leading to this decision was the Clinton 
Administration's view of China as "the only neighbor" who can 
persuade North Korea for a solution to its nuclear problem. 
  The article, however, points to "a certain degree of 
criticism" of President Clinton's decision within the United 
States for the "result of completely ignoring the human rights 
issue," and to "differences in views" even between diplomatic 
teams and economic teams within the government in connection 
with the linkage of human rights with the renewal of China's MFN 
status. The article writes that the Clinton Administration's 
decision clearly shows its "trade- first" policy as seen in 
recent economic negotiations with Japan and Vietnam. 
  The pro-government daily SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 4 a 
1,400-word article by Washington-based correspondent Yi 
Kyong-hyong entitled "U.S. Choice of Practical Interest Rather 
than Moral Obligations for the Human Rights Issue." The article 
notes that this decision was prompted, in part, by President 
Clinton's assessment that the policy of linking human rights 
with trade is "no longer effective," and by "pressure from 
interested organizations" within the United States which are 
striving to promote trade relations with China. Pointing to the 
increase in U.S. exports to China and to new employment 
generated by trade with China, the article writes that President 
Clinton stressed that China shares "common interests" with the 
United States for attaining "stability" in the Northeast Asia, 
including the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The 
Clinton Administration's withdrawal of the policy of linking 
human rights with trade does not necessarily mean the 
"abandonment" of its foreign policy on human rights, and its 
decision to ban the import of Chinese-made weapons and 
ammunition is a "symbolic pursuance of moral obligations" to 
human rights diplomacy. The article predicts that the U.S. 
human rights policy will turn from a "linkage strategy" to a 
"broad-range interference strategy," including support for 
Chinese organizations which are devoted to human rights and 
democracy, and strengthening the activities of "Voice of Free 
Asia" and "Voice of America." The article adds that the recent 
step, on the other hand, will also negatively affect Americans' 
trust in President Clinton's leadership and policy. 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 5 a 
1,400-word article by reporter O Yong, entitled "The U.S. Choice 
of Practical Interest Suggests Great Change in U.S. Policy on 
Asia." Noting that U.S.-China negotiations over MFN status have 
ended with "China's victory," the article says the current step 
by the Clinton Administration can be regarded as a "change in 
policy" having "impact" on overall U.S. policy toward Asia. 
Analyzing a few factors that led to this decision, including 
"enormous market potentials" in China and "fierce criticism" at 
home and abroad of the policy of linking human rights with 
trade, the article notes that with the current decision, the 
United States is assigned a task to "amend" its Asian policy, 
and its "rough relations" with China in the past will "heave a 
sigh of relief." This step will, the article says, also exert 
"positive influence" on China's joining the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, with the human rights issue being excluded as 
a separated issue.

<F P=106> [Kim Son-ki report from Moscow] </F>
  [Text] It was learned that an ROK-Russia joint declaration, 
the New Moscow Declaration, supporting our position surrounding 
the North Korean nuclear issue, will be adopted at the 
Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Yeltsin summit, scheduled to start 
on 1 June. 
  In the New Moscow Declaration, Russia will actively support 
our view on the North Korean nuclear issue, and reveal that it 
fully supports efforts to bring about peace on the Korean 
peninsula. It seems that a passage stating that all matters of 
concern and interest between the two countries will be closely 
maintained by dialogue and another one on readjusting the past 
history, such as the Korean Air shooting incident, will be 
included in the declaration. It will also include the human 
rights issue such as that of the North Korean loggers. 
  This kind of joint declaration was not made when President 
Kim visited China and Japan. It is believed that this 
declaration has greater weight than the regular joint statements 
that sum up the results of summits. 
  A diplomatic source said that a consultative protocol, which 
provides for the foreign ministers and vice foreign ministers to 
meet regularly, will be exchanged during President Kim's visit 
to Russia. It also revealed that an agreement on preventing 
maritime accidents, an environment cooperative agreement, and an 
agreement to protect migratory birds will be signed.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Kim Yong-sam at Seoul Airport before </F>
leaving for Moscow on official visits to Russia and Uzbekistan 
-- live] 
  [Text] Dear fellow countrymen: Today I am going to leave 
the country to make an official visit to Russia and Uzbekistan. 
This visit is an extention of thse I made to the United States, 
Japan, and China over the past year. These countries have a 
very important influence on the stability and peace of the 
Korean peninsula. When I visited these countries, I stressed to 
their government leaders and people the need for their 
cooperation for peace on the Korean peninsula and won their 
support. Now I am going to visit Russia in order to conclude 
the quadrilateral diplomacy that I have sought for stability and 
peace of the Korean peninsula since I assumed office. 
  In summit talks with President Yeltsin, I will sincerely 
[chinjihage] discuss the issue of peace in East Asia, security 
of the ROK, and economic cooperation needed by both countries. 
Particularly at this point of time, when the solution to North 
Korea's nuclear issue is urgently required, it is very 
significant to develop closer relations with Russia. This visit 
will be an occasion to confirm that the Cold War era between the 
ROK and Russia has clearly ended. 
  During my visit at the Russian Federal Council and Moscow 
University, I will appeal to Russian politicians and young 
people, who face difficulties in a transitional period, to 
advance toward building a great Russia without giving up their 
hopes and dreams. 
  Russia is vast and very rich in natural resources. 
Therefore, it has boundless potential for development. On the 
other hand, Uzbekistan is in a stable situation and rich in 
natural resources. Therefore, it is a country with many 
possibilities for economic cooperation with our country. 
  In the summit talks with President Karimov, I will deeply 
discuss the issue of the advance of our enterprises into this 
country. 
  In Uzbekistan, there are as many as 200,000 Korean residents 
who are descendents of people who were forcibly relocated from 
the Maritime Province of Siberia to Central Asia. I will meet 
these compatriots and console them. I will also discuss the 
matter of promoting their rights and interests. 
  On my way back home, I will also visit the Russian Pacific 
Fleet in Vladivostok, where I would like to experience [silgam] 
the changes in ROK-Russia relations along with our people. 
  Dear fellow countrymen, while in Russia, I will promise to 
establish constructive and complementary partnership 
[konsolchogigo sangho powanjogin tongbanja kwangye] with it 
towards the 21st century. With this as a momentum, our country 
will establish firm cooperative relations with the major 
countries around the Korean peninsula -- the United States, 
Japan, China, and Russia -- not only in security, but in 
economics. 
  We should open the Asia-Pacific era of the 21st century with 
these four countries. Our nation's destiny was decided by these 
four countries 100 years ago. However, our current effort to 
strengthen friendly and cooperative relations with them contains 
the positive meaning [chokkukchok uimi] that we will explore our 
destiny ourselves. Our compatriots are evenly distributed in 
these four countries. Our position has greatly changed. As a 
result, we can discuss world issues with the four countries, and 
they also need our country's cooperation and coordination 
[chojong]. 
  What is most important to us now is for people to achieve 
internal unity and accord, to develop the national destiny with 
that unity, and to increase the country's competitive strength 
with all our efforts. We have no time to pause for 
energy-consuming conflict. I, as president, will go even to the 
ends of the earth to do my best where our country's security and 
interests are concerned. 
  Dear fellow countrymen, your encouragement will give me 
courage and strength during my trip. I wish you good health and 
fortune while I am away briefly. 
  Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [By reporter Cho Yu-sik] </F>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Some parts of the results of 
the Uruguay Round [UR] of multilateral trade negotiations are 
either hardly acceptable or should be amended because they so 
vitally affect our national interests. If so, is the demand 
for a renegotiation of these parts realistic? 
  In this regard, Kim Chol-su, minister of trade and industry, 
spelled out the government position in these words: "Of course, 
we need to reexamine our past mistakes to learn a lesson from 
them. But we should refrain from wasteful backward-leaning 
argument, but engage in constructive and forward-looking 
debate." The government's feeling is summed up in the following 
words of another concerned official of the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Fisheries: "After everyone has gone home upon 
completion of the negotiation, we feel we have lost something. 
So we are out on the field alone, trying to call back everyone 
to the negotiating table. But no one would show up." 
  Needless to say, these words were uttered on the assumption 
that it is impossible to renegotiate. The following are the 
grounds of this assumption: 
  First, it is too late to negotiate because our government 
already agreed to the UR basic principles on 15 December 1993, 
presented our final "country schedule" for market opening, and 
signed the final protocol acknowledging the overall outcome of 
the UR round at Marrackech, Morocco, on 12 April this year. It 
is no use trying to stop the train after it has already started 
out. Trying to overturn what was agreed upon at the 
multilateral talks is tantamount to keeping two tongues in one 
mouth and would only damage our international prestige. 
  Second, even if a renegotiation is allowed, it will be 
impossible to make an amendment aimed at narrowing the scope of 
opening, although it is possible to expand the scope of market 
opening. According to this school of thought, inasmuch as it is 
the spirit of the UR negotiations to remove the tariff and 
nontariff barriers and expand free trade, an "amendment for a 
narrower opening" is impossible. 
  Third, it is difficult to overturn even what was agreed upon 
at one-on-one bilateral talks. Then, how could a small nation 
like ours hope to bring the whole world into a renegotiation to 
change what was agreed upon at the extensive multilateral UR 
negotiations? 
  Fourth, should the National Assembly refuse to ratify the 
agreement as demanded by the farmers' organizations, some civic 
groups, and the opposition parties, which call for 
renegotiation, our country would end up withdrawing from the 
Uruguay structure and being isolated from the international 
community. (In the words of Kim Chol-su, minister of trade and 
industry,) "It is unthinkable for our country, which has 
attained economic growth through exports, to refuse to ratify 
the UR agreement, for such refusal would make our country an 
international missing child. Nor is it possible to renegotiate." 
  Fifth, should we refuse to ratify the UR agreement, we would 
have disadvantages in terms of tariffs and trade and suffer 
from a fatal economic blow. 
  In brief, they argue that now that the negotiations are 
over, it is no use crying alone for a renegotiation. It would 
only damage our international prestige. If there is to be a 
renegotiation, it will be allowed only to expand the scope of 
opening. The UR negotiations being multilateral talks, not a 
bilateral negotiation, it is all the more difficult to make a 
belated amendment to what was agreed upon at the UR talks. 
Should our National Assembly refuse to ratify the agreement, 
our country would keep out of the UR system and become an 
international orphan. As a consequence, we would suffer from a 
fatal economic blow. 
  The UR negotiations came to a close in Morocco on 12 April 
with the ministers of participating countries signing the final 
protocol and the agreement on establishing the World Trade 
Organization [WTO]. As far as the procedure is concerned, the 
WTO now only awaits its departure at full steam. All that needs 
to be done is for the parliament of each member country to 
ratify the results of the negotiations within this year before 
the agreement takes effect on 1 July 1995. All countries have 
already presented their schedules for market opening. 
  The proponents of renegotiation argue that, primarily we 
should have renegotiated before the Morocco ministerial 
conference was held on 12 April and prior to submitting a final 
country schedule in order to attain the maximum advantages and 
reflect the results in the final country schedule for opening. 
  Now that the ministerial conference is over and a country 
schedule for market reopening has been submitted, there may no 
room for amendment. But the proponents of amendment think 
otherwise. 
  First, the basic provisions of the UR agreement cannot be 
changed, but it is possible to change the country schedule 
before the WTO is formerly inaugurated in the future. In other 
words, the scope and timing for opening agreed upon at the 
multilateral negotiations cannot be changed, but an amendment 
is possible within the agreed upon scope and timing. In 
addition, when a far more disadvantageous schedule than what 
was agreed upon at the multilateral negotiations is forced upon 
a country at bilateral talks, it is possible for this country 
to demand a renegotiation "in the name of the UR" or bring the 
case before GATT. 
  Second, in the UR agreement there is no provision that 
amendment is allowed only to enlarge the scope of market 
opening. Such a provision, if there is one, wouldn't square 
with reality. 
  In fact, after the basic provisions were finally approved on 
15 December last year, the United States and Japan attempted to 
impose some tariffs on semiconductors, whisky, timber, and in 
particular nonferrous metals, by discarding their previous 
nontariffication agreement for these items. By seizing this 
opportunity, the ROK once drew up a plan to break its 
nontariffication promise and impose 3 to 4 percent of tariffs 
on specific items. The United States and Canada attempted to 
impose quotas on some items with a view to opening overseas 
farm markets in a way more advantageous to them. These moves 
are the clear attempts by various countries to amend previous 
agreements so that the scope of opening might be narrowed, 
indicating that depending on circumstances, it is possible to 
renegotiate to reduce the scope of market opening. Needless to 
say, one-sided change of the agreed upon scope is unacceptable. 
But if there is a sufficient ground, renegotiation for an 
amendment should be allowed. 
  The proponents of renegotiation argue that it falls within 
the right of contracting parties to reverse an expanded scope 
of opening far exceeding the scope required under the UR 
provisions to "the normal level," aside from the question of 
whether the amendment is aimed at enlarging the scope of 
opening or reducing it. 
  Third, once the contracting parties agree to change the 
previously agreed schedule of enforcement, the change needs an 
endorsement by all WTO members just as a matter of formality. 
But barring a flaw to such agreement, nobody would raise an 
objection. The proponents of renegotiation argue that there is 
no reason for a third party to oppose an amendment when the 
amendment is not to change a basic provision of the UR 
agreement, but to change a country schedule for opening under 
the basic principles of the agreement, in cases where the 
interested parties agree to the amendment. 
  Fourth, these proponents argue that even in the worst 
scenario in which our country withholds the final signing until 
after the inauguration of the WTO because of the failure of a 
renegotiation to wind up by that time, we will not be kept out 
of the UR system. The WTO charter agreement provides that the 
agreement be ratified two years prior to the date of 
effectuation. Accordingly, all that the ROK should do is to 
join the WTO by signing it by a cabinet minister, and pending a 
formal ratification by the National Assembly, bring its case 
before the WTO as a member, calling for a renegotiation on 
matters at issue. Needless to say, if the renegotiation is 
completed before the WTO is formally inaugurated, it will pose 
no problem at all. 
  Fifth, therefore even if our National Assembly delays (or 
withholds) the ratification of the WTO agreement and our 
government tries to renegotiate on some items, we will not 
become "an international orphan." The National Assembly's 
refusal to ratify the agreement can be fully regarded as a 
weapon for strengthening our negotiating position and need not 
be considered as taboo. 
  In the case of the United States, it is unclear whether the 
U.S. Congress will ratify the agreement within the deadline. In 
accordance with Article 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act 
(AAA) which provides that under no international agreement 
shall the major agricultural and livestock markets be open to 
the outside world, and according to other domestic statutes, 
the United States refused to open markets for 14 basic farm and 
livestock products in the past. Recently, a large number of 
U.S. senators have resolved to reject any opening of markets 
for 14 basic farm and livestock products in accordance with the 
AAA provisions. With considerable rough sailing and difficulty 
anticipated in the process of ratification by the U.S. 
Congress, the Congress is hardly expected to complete the 
ratification process within the time limit set by the UR 
agreement. In India there have been strong anti-UR 
demonstrations, and the prospect is dim for an early 
ratification by the parliament in which the government party is 
in the minority. 
  It appears that a revision of the schedule for market 
opening is theoretically possible. But this possibility cannot 
become reality unless our trade officials have a strong policy 
will and public opinion unanimously backs them up. 
  If so, it is necessary to delve into the reasons why our 
trade officials have failed in the negotiating process in the 
past. 
  The reason mentioned most often is the lack of expertise on 
the part of the trade officials who took part in the 
negotiations. It is said that the inadequate knowledge of the 
UR negotiating provisions, the lack of international 
negotiating experience, and the lack of a good command of 
English have resulted in a disadvantage in the negotiations. 
Our trade officials were unable to interpret UR provisions 
properly and had to seek advice from a relevant U.S. research 
institute on a a slew of provisions they did not understand. 
  A communications official who took part in the negotiation 
commented as follows: "We feel that people who talk about the 
lack of expertise are playing with words. In fact, where can 
you find anyone who has greater expertise than our trade 
officials? They do not work alone; they always get help from 
research institutions. They marshal all available brains at 
home. 
  "The UR negotiation is not an Oriental style or Korean style 
negotiation. It has been conducted according to the practices 
of the United States and the EC, and the UR agreement is 
written in the letters of their alphabet. Naturally, there are 
many things which are in accord with their realities but which 
are out of accord with our legal system and our language. 
  "The ability to negotiate differs not in accordance with 
individual abilities, but in accordance with the national 
ability. In many cases, the United States or the EC is too 
formidable an opponent. That is why we took actions in concert 
with countries in the same boat and produced certain results in 
areas such as antidumping charges, subsidy, and intellectual 
property. However, we could find no country which would act in 
concert with us in the field of farm products." 
  In brief, this official claims that our negotiators did 
their best under an unfavorable condition, and that the 
unsatisfactory results were due to the inequality in ability 
between the strong and the weak. However, did they really do 
their best? Can they explain their failure to gain what is 
guaranteed under the provisions of the UR agreement with the 
idea of disparity in ability between the weak and the strong? 
  No other country has ever opened its markets for a greater 
number of goods at greater rates and at a faster pace than the 
ROK did in GATT history. The ROK is among the countries subject 
to the greatest trade pressures from the United States. But 
never, not even once, has our government objected to U.S. trade 
pressures. 
  "When there is some trade friction, it is not necessary for 
the whole country to clamor for an early settlement or make 
haste. When there is a demand from one of our trade partners, 
what we need is the attitude of trying to understand the 
position of the other side and be concerned about it rather 
than taking the demand as a pressure.'" 
  Those are the words of our minister of trade and industry, 
the cabinet member in charge of trade matters. Other trade 
bureaucrats also stress that the disadvantageous results of the 
just-ended UR negotiation was "due to the U.S. pressures." 
Among the heads or trade ministers of developing countries, no 
one knows better than the head or trade minister of our country 
how to refrain as much as possible from making any remarks that 
may offend the United States. These days when someone clumsily 
makes an issue of U.S. trade pressures, he is apt to be branded 
as a sentimental nationalist lacking in international sense. 
  It is questionable whether this kind of stance will be of 
any help in trade negotiations with the United States. Without 
a shift in thinking to the stance of regarding any unwarranted 
demand of the United States not as an "understandable request," 
but as an "unacceptable pressure," it seems highly unlikely for 
our trade bureaucrats to come forward on their own demanding 
renegotiation. 
  Needless to say, we should not negotiate in such a manner as 
to harm the opponent in order to gain our own benefits. But 
only when we effect a shift in our thinking to an independent 
stance, is it possible for us to avoid getting insulted to our 
faces. This shifting is what our trade bureaucrats are yet to 
accomplish. 
  In fact, the key to renegotiation is the National Assembly's 
refusal to ratify the results of the UR negotiations. If the 
National Assembly rejects ratification, the executive branch 
will have no alternative but to carry out a renegotiation. It 
provides the ground for the government in breaking the existing 
agreement and making new demands. It will be alright for the 
National Assembly to ratify the revised agreement arrived at 
later by renegotiation. 
  As of this moment, all of the opposition assemblymen have 
signed their signatures on the pledge to oppose the 
ratification of the UR agreement in a campaign kicked off by 
the "National Campaign Headquarters for the Protection of Our 
Agriculture. They are 96 DP [Democratic Party], 12 UNP [United 
National Party], two KNP [Korea National Party], and one NPPR 
assemblymen. Of the 16 independent assemblymen, only two have 
signed the pledge, but all of the independents are expected to 
sign in the future. Still, the campaign needs to obtain 
signatures of between 25 and 30 LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] 
assemblymen in order to come up with 150 signatures necessary 
to foil ratification in the National Assembly. 
  Currently, efforts are under way to persuade LDP assemblymen 
mainly through each county-level farmers association. As of 
early March, five LDP assemblymen, including Kim Pom-myon from 
Nonsan County, reportedly signed the pledge to vote no to the 
ratification motion. Currently, the signature campaign is in a 
temporary lull as DLP issued a guideline and otherwise stepped 
up internal control against the signature campaign. 
  The "National Campaign Headquarters" has concentrated its 
efforts on 35 rural districts throughout the country, including 
four in the Taejon- Chungnam area and seven in the 
Taegu-Kyongbuk area, contacting DLP parliamentarians in these 
areas in an effort to persuade them. It is conducting a recall 
drive against uncooperative DLP assemblymen by collecting the 
signatures of one-third of the eligible voters. 
  However, it is still questionable how much this campaign 
will prove effective. [passage omitted] 
  The road to a renegotiation of the UR agreement is far and 
rough.
