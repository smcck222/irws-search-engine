  [Text] With President Kim Yong-sam's visit to Russia and 
Uzbekistan as momentum, the government agencies involved in 
foreign affairs, national security, and public security have 
gone into an emergency duty system for a week from today until 7 
June. 
  In particular, these agencies are heightening their degree 
of 
alertness more than ever before, including preparations against 
an eventuality that might arise during the president's absence, 
in that President Kim's tour of this time is being made under 
the circumstances in which North Korea's nuclear issue is at a 
grave stage. 
  From today on, the military has gone into a special alert 
stance [tukpyol kyongye] by strengthening the around-the-clock 
watch system, while keeping an eye on the movement of the North 
Korean Army and reconnoitering the area along the truce line.

  [Text] Seoul, June 1 (YONHAP) -- While President Kim 
Yong-sam is away from the country on state visits to Russia and 
Uzbekistan from June 1-7, Chongwadae [presidential offices], the 
Office of the Prime Minister and the Foreign, Home and Defense 
Ministries are prepared for any emergency. 
  Because the president is abroad when the North Korean 
nuclear 
dispute is facing a critical moment, these national security- 
and public order-related agencies are on alert against anything 
that might happen during his absence. 
  Tension on the Korean peninsula is mounting as the UN 
Security Council has taken up the nuclear issue. Concerned 
about this development, President Kim instructed 
security-related ministers to prepare fully for any abrupt North 
Korean action in a meeting he himself presided over Sunday. On 
Monday, he invited Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok, Economic Planning 
Minister Chong Chae-sok and National Unification Minister Yi 
Hong-ku to breakfast at Chongwadae and told them to preserve 
national security and public order during his absence. 
  Stressing that the row over Pyongyang's nuclear program is 
entering a critical phase, Kim said the government should remain 
on around-the-clock alert so that South Koreans can go about 
their business without feeling a sense of crisis. He also 
called for all- out efforts to prevent major accidents. 
  Prime minister Yi, giving a briefing on the cabinet's 
determination to hold the fort during the president's absence, 
said all cabinet members would fully support Kim's summit 
diplomacy in Russia and Uzbekistan by maintaining national 
security and public order and taking all possible precautions 
against accidents. 
  On Monday morning, President Kim called President Bill 
Clinton, who was about to fly to Europe to attend ceremonies 
marking the 50th anniversary of the Normandy invasion, to ensure 
close Korea-U.S. cooperation in dealing with the North Korean 
nuclear issue and to explain about his trip to Russia and 
Uzbekistan. 
  The hot-line conversation with Clinton ended Kim's official 
schedule prior to his departure for Moscow on Wednesday. 
  On Monday afternoon, Kim personally checked the agenda for 
his summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the speeches 
he is to make in Russia and Uzbekistan. 
  Chongwadae virtually adopted an emergency stance under Chief 
of Staff Pak Kwan-yong's control Monday. 
  As Senior Foreign Affairs and Security Secretary Chong 
Chong-uk, Senior Economic Secretary Pak Chae-yun, Senior Press 
Secretary Chu Ton-sik and Senior Administrative Secretary Hong 
In-kil are to accompany the president to Russia and Uzbekistan, 
all remaining senior secretaries -- Chief Secretary Pak 
Kwan-yong, Senior Political Secretary Yi Won-chong, Senior 
Government Affairs Secretary Yi Ui-kun, Senior 
Petition-Information Secretary Kim Yong- su and Senior 
Education-Culture Secretary Kim Chong-nam -- will take turns 
serving as Chongwadae duty officer. 
  Chongwadae is also maintaining around-the-clock 
communication 
with the traveling president. 
  Prime Minister Yi is in charge of state affairs during the 
president's absence, and this is his first experience as prime 
minister. His office is thus prepared to help Yi carry out his 
duties during the president's absence by maintaining close 
cooperation with Chongwadae and national security-related 
agencies. 
  The Foreign Ministry is working 24 hours a day under Vice 
Minister Pak Kun-u, as Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu is a member 
of the president's entourage. 
  The Home and Defense Ministries implemented an emergency 
work 
system Wednesday, while the armed forces are on high alert to 
increase surveillance of North Korea's military movements. 
  The police have strengthened their posture against crime 
nationwide to maintain law and order while the president is away.

  [Text] Seoul, June 1 (YONHAP) -- Police launched a 
large-scale hunt for 30 to 40 leaders of the Korea Federation of 
University Student Councils [Hanchongnyon] Wednesday after 
deciding that Hanchongnyon is a pro-North Korean communist 
organization. 
  Some 50,000 radical students joined by citizens staged 
massive anti-government and anti-U.S. rallies and demonstrations 
in Kwangju on Sunday, distributing leaflets calling the Korean 
war (1950-53) a war of liberation from the American imperialists. 
  They also demanded an immediate end to international 
pressure 
on Pyongyang to halt its nuclear weapons program and praised 
North Korean President Kim Il-song's chuche ideology. 
  Police said they have obtained arrest warrants for 
Hanchongnyon Chairman Kim Yong-chun, 24, of Pusan University, 
and Yang Tong-hun, 22, of Chosun University in Kwangu, chairman 
of the committee for reunification of the motherland, among 
others. 
  In addition, police secured a list of the names of nine 
students described as chairmen of the regional reunification 
committees and nine others. 
  Police are also investigating 20 other students on suspicion 
of being core members of Pomchonghaknyon or the Pan-National 
Student Alliance. 
  According to police, Pomchonghaknyon consists of an 
11-member 
leadership, 25 standing committee men and 200 members.

  [Text] Ulchin, North Kyongsang Province, May 31 (YONHAP) 
-- Some 5,000 residents of Ulchin County, protesting government 
plans to build a nuclear waste dump, staged violent 
demonstrations Monday, blocking highway traffic, puncturing the 
tires of passing cars and setting fire to them. 
  At least 60 people including several policemen were injured 
when the protesters clashed with riot police during 
demonstrations that followed a rally earlier in the day. 
  Police deployed 5,000 men and placed them at strategic 
points 
to bring the demonstrations under control. Some 25 residents 
were taken into police custody for questioning, police said. 
  Meanwhile, 88 percent of the county's parents kept their 
children at home, forcing them to boycott classes at three 
middle and high schools in the area. 
  The rally was held at 1 PM in Ulchin town square to demand 
the suspension of work on the third and fourth nuclear power 
generating stations and the resignation of the science and 
technology minister, in addition to expressing their opposition 
to building the nuclear waste dump.

  [Text] Uljin, June 1 (YONHAP) -- Yielding to local 
villagers' protests, the government has retracted a plan to 
build a large radioactive nuclear waste disposal yard here in 
Uljin along the east coast. 
  Uljin County Commissioner Kim Tong-hui met reporters 
Wednesday afternoon to make public Science and Technology 
Minister Kim Si- chung's message containing the retraction. 
  The message read in part, "This is to inform you that 
although some residents of the Uljin area tried to induce a 
radioactive waste management facility, the government has 
decided not to set up such a facility in the Uljin area in 
consideration of various conditions." 
  Meanwhile, large crowds of Uljin people mounted various 
protest actions for the fifth straight day Wednesday against the 
planned creation of a nuclear waste yard. 
  About 1,500 high school students staged a sit-in along a 
major road near Uljin-up beginning around 2 PM while about 200 
shop owners in the Uljin town closed their shops for the day as 
a sign of protest. 
  Around 12 noon, some 1,000 villagers of Puk-myon poured into 
the street and blocked traffic. 
  Of the 12,000 primary and secondary school students in the 
Uljin area, about 10,000 boycotted classes Wednesday in a 
protest move.

  [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- Faced with growing 
pressure from the United States for opening the automobile 
market, the government has decided to take a set of measures to 
open the market step by step ahead of the original schedule. 
  As an initial step, regulation of the floor space and number 
of foreign automobile sales outlets will be removed and 
restrictions on foreign car advertisement lifted in the 
foreseeable future. A government trade official said on Tuesday 
the government would also positively mull lowering automobile 
import tariffs and refix other taxes on imported vehicles. 
  A comprehensive motor market opening plan will be prepared 
shortly through consultations among relevant offices so that it 
could be presented to U.S. negotiators at a Korea-U.S. economic 
council meeting slated for June 22 in the United States. 
  The official noted that originally control of the floor 
space 
and number of foreign automobile sales outlets is set to be 
removed completely in January 1996 under the five-year 
investment opening plan made public last year. "But, we have 
tentatively agreed to move up the time of the removal to the 
most possible extent in view of the U.S. demand for the opening 
of the automobile market," he said. 
  However, conflicting views have been aired among offices as 
to the issue of whether to reduce automobile tariffs and 
readjust other taxes on imported vehicles, the official added.

<F P=106> ["Part One" of the report delivered by Deputy Prime Minister </F>
Phan Van Khai at the opening of the Ninth National Assembly 
Fifth Session held at the Ba Dinh Conference Hall in Hanoi on 26 
May -- recorded] 
  [Text] In this report, on behalf of the Government and the 
prime minister, I would like to make general remarks on the 
current situation and present a clearer picture of a number of 
major issues that need to be resolved in the days ahead to 
implement successfully the National Assembly's resolutions on 
the tasks for 1994. 
  Based on the results obtained from the implementation of 
tasks for the first four months of the year and on the projected 
developments of the situation till June, we can point out the 
following outstanding traits: 
  First, the positive financial and economic changes of the 
past few years have been sustained and developed in the first 
six months of 1994, thus producing rather comprehensive progress 
in the areas of economic production, goods circulation, finance, 
money, and external economic relations with a higher growth rate 
compared with the corresponding period in the past few years. 
  The winter-spring crop is expected to achieve the highest 
output so far, up one million tons compared with last year (or 
an increase of 10 percent). The structure of the rural economy 
has been reformed in the direction of increasing industrial and 
special crop yields as well as of promoting animal husbandry, 
especially aquaculture, and non-farming occupations. 
  The industrial production in the first six months of the 
year 
is expected to increase by 12 percent compared with the 
corresponding period in the previous year (the target put forth 
for the whole year is 11 percent), with the rather harmonious 
development of all economic sectors, cities, and industrial 
centers, a number of major electricity-generating and transport 
projects have been completed and put into operation. These 
include the last group of generators of the Hoa Binh 
Hydroelectric Power Plant, the turbine power plant in Ba Ria, 
the 220-kilovolt powerline between Ba Ria and Long Binh, the 
highway section between northern Thang Long and Noi Bai, and so 
forth. 
  The most significant project, the 500-kilovolt powerline, 
has 
been completed as scheduled following two years of countless 
difficulties and obstacles. This required the greatest efforts 
to ensure stable and safe operations. Experimental operations 
started on 20 May 1994 and the network will be officially 
switched on by early June to supply electricity from north to 
south, thus exerting an overall impact on the national economy 
and the people's lives. 
  The export value is estimated to increase by 27 percent (the 
projected yearly target is put forth at 20 percent). Import 
value is expected to increase by 23.4 percent. The foreign 
Official Development Aid (ODA) sources signed in the first 
quarter of this year has nearly doubled the 1993 amount. Direct 
foreign investment projects licensed in the first half of 1994 
totalled $2 billion in registered capital, or two-thirds of last 
year's figure. The amount of capital actually put in use 
increased by 60 percent over the same period in the previous 
year. 
  The total value of retail sales is expected to increase by 
37.76 percent, meeting the diversified demands of the population 
with higher incomes and purchasing power. Goods and passengers 
transportation, domestic and international tourism, and other 
services have reached new heights. Price indexes of retail 
sales and services in the first four months of the year 
increased by 5.4 percent, mainly for food and foodstuffs during 
the Tet holidays. Since March, prices have stabilized. 
  According to reports from the Statistics General Department, 
the consumer goods index in May 1994 increased by 0.6 percent 
over April with food accounting for 1.1 percent, non-food and 
foodstuffs 0.2 percent, and services 0.4 percent. If we compare 
May 1994 with December 1993, the price index has increased by 
six percent with food and foodstuffs accounting for 11.1 
percent, other goods for one percent, and services for 5.9 
percent. In short, though prices this year increased more 
rapidly than the same period in the previous year, they mainly 
affected food and foodstuffs, a trend that suits the 
government's policy of not letting the prices of food and 
foodstuffs fall too low. 
  Regarding domestic budget revenue, it is expected to 
increase 
by 50 percent compared with the corresponding period in the 
previous year. The annual increase was put forth at 31.5 
percent. Phase two of the new wage policy, which would 
introduce an increase of 25 percent to the wage fund, has been 
developed since early this year in a way that will not cause 
unexpected price fluctuations but ensure smoother cash flow and 
prevent cash shortages. The currency exchange rates and gold 
prices did not show any major fluctuations. The credit system 
was expanded a step further and the loan payment surplus was 
estimated to increase by 23 percent compared with the 
corresponding period in late 1993. The rate of credit loans to 
the non-state sector -- mainly to peasant households -- 
increased from 30 percent in 1993 to 40 percent in the first 
half of this year. 
  However, positive elements to ensure economic stabilization 
and favorable conditions for new development steps are not very 
stable in many aspects. The state budget balance is facing 
difficulties. Internal and foreign credit resources to cover 
national overspending are still limited. Monetary circulation 
still carries unstable factors, and the amount of foreign 
currencies circulating outside state control is still fairly 
great. Policies and measures on mobilizing more capital only 
meet the current demand at a low level. Several agricultural 
products, industrial commodities, and consumer goods are facing 
difficulties finding a market. Planning for state investment 
has been executed at a low level due to lack of capital. 
Projects funded by loans and several foreign joint venture 
projects do not have enough capital to get off the ground. The 
reorganization and rearrangement designed to improve management 
in the state economic sector and in handling public property, 
guide and promote domestic investment, improve foreign 
investment procedures, and establish order and discipline in 
economic activities in the market mechanism have not scored 
significant progress. 
  Second, together with economic development and increasing 
incomes, cultural and social activities have progressed with 
more students registered at all education levels and better 
teaching and learning quality; the tertiary education system 
has been reorganized with the formation of national universities 
and regional universities; science and technology research has 
been concentrated more on key programs; management of product 
measurement and product quality is in progress, and 
environmental protection activities have been implemented 
according to the recently introduced law. The information and 
cultural work have been directed more at the grass roots level. 
Many activities have been organized to preserve historical 
traditions and national cultural characteristics and to broaden 
cultural exchanges with foreign countries. Activities to mark 
the 40th anniversary of the Dien Bien Phu victory have been held 
in many diversified and vivid forms, satisfactorily cultivating 
encouraging and educational effects on different generations. 
National programs to generate more jobs, prevent and fight 
contagious diseases, provide family planning services and mother 
and child care, support sports and physical education 
activities, eliminate starvation and alleviate poverty, and 
repay favors to people who have rendered meritorious service to 
the nation have been implemented widely and become more 
socialized. 
  The fight against social evils has received better guidance 
and coordination from the government, mass organizations, 
schools, and families. 
  The government has supplemented and carried out practical 
lines and policies to support socioeconomic development in the 
mountainous areas and in ethnic areas. Many mountainous 
provinces and districts have established their own economic 
structure to increase commodity production on the basis of 
exploiting their local advantages. The government is directly 
providing guidance to one pilot province and district to draw 
experiences. 
  State investment in mountainous areas, including allocation 
to local budgets and projects funded by different ministries, is 
double the 1993 amount. Since the beginning of this year, many 
construction projects and investment programs for mountainous 
areas have been executed. They include projects to build more 
public roads, provide electricity and water for production and 
living, expand primary health care, fight against malaria and 
goiter, restore and build more schools and classes, construct 
boarding schools for ethnic students, and improve cultural and 
information services. 
  The state trading sector has been entrusted with the duty of 
purchasing all commodities and supplying staple goods to 
mountainous areas. Apart from continuing to grant subsidies to 
the transport cost of seven types of goods, the government has 
decided to provide free four types of goods to upland people. 
These goods are iodized salt, diesel, medicine, and stationery 
for students. 
  The past progress has prevented the degradation and scored 
new development steps in some fields. However, the improvement 
is not great compared to the requirements of our human 
development strategy in the transitional period for the national 
industrialization and modernization. The advancement steps are 
not powerful enough to push back and prevent social evils and to 
help the spiritual life, morality, and social environment 
improve and become more useful for economic development in these 
areas. Commodity production, goods circulation, and material 
and cultural life for the mountainous people still face many 
difficulties. 
  Third, our international relations are expanding and 
consolidating continuously in the direction of diversification 
and multilateralization. During the first several months of the 
year, exchange visits of our high-ranking leaders with leaders 
of a number of countries, especially regional countries, have 
contributed significantly to improving mutual understanding and 
accelerating multifaceted cooperative relations. 
  The resumption of normal relations by international monetary 
organizations with Vietnam, and the lifting of the trade embargo 
against us by the United States administration early this year 
have created favorable conditions for normalizing relations 
between Vietnam and the United States, as well as encouraging 
cooperation between international organizations and other 
countries with us. Our international relations are progressing 
at a relatively fast pace in a positive direction and are 
contributing to consolidating peace, stability, and cooperation 
for the sake of national construction. 
  There still, however, were some complicated incidents on the 
borders, such as recent violations of our economic privilege 
zone and continental shelf. The situation in Cambodia also 
contains elements that cause concern. 
  National defense work continues to be consolidated in the 
recent past, territorial integrity was well safeguarded, all 
sabotage plots and activities were discovered and suppressed, 
lawbreakers were subdued, and social order and safety were 
maintained. The new situation requires the state and people to 
strengthen their support and create better conditions for the 
national defense forces so that they can cope with their heavy 
responsibility. 
  Also, the state management mechanism has achieved good 
progress in terms of leadership and managing tasks. While 
consolidating its leadership role and dealing effectively with 
urgent issues for the short term, the government has also tried 
to study and resolve essential issues which are strategically 
important in the new situation, such as the comprehensive plan 
to combine economic renovation with administrative reform, 
building up the legal system, planning for major industry 
sectors and economic zones and for major projects that should be 
implemented from now to the year 2000. 
  Coordination among the legislature, administration, and 
judiciary agencies, and with mass organizations in a number of 
fields have gradually regulated, thus guaranteeing better 
performance. 
  The pace of reform of the state management mechanism, 
however, is still too slow. The administration reform has not 
genuinely functioned yet in reality. The contingent of cadres 
in many agencies and at various sectors and echelons is 
displaying the ineptness which makes them unable to catch up 
with the demands of the renovation. Improper discipline, 
degenerated morality, and, worst of all, corruption, 
embezzlement and waste of public property, and extortion, are 
still popular. Enforcing the law at one's own convenience, or 
not obeying government decisions is still rampant at not only 
the grass roots level, but also at some provincial 
administrations. Several party and state policies, therefore, 
could not reach the people, or have been misled and made 
inefficient. These flaws within the state mechanism are the 
major obstacles in the renovation undertaking and national 
development. 
  Generally speaking, the socioeconomic situation in the first 
several months of the year has been developing in a positive 
direction, ensuring a good possibility to fulfill and even 
exceed all 1994 tasks as determined by the resolutions of the 
National Assembly. Difficulties, however, are numerous and 
serious because of the slowness in rectifying weaknesses we have 
had for a very long time, and also by the greater demands of the 
new development stage as well as new complicated developments 
that affect the protection of national order and safety.

<F P=106> ["Part two" of the report by Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van </F>
Khai at the opening of the Ninth National Assembly's Fifth 
Session held at the Ba Dinh Conference Hall in Hanoi on 26 May 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] With the results obtained in the implementation of 
its tasks during the first months of the year, the government 
has resolved to provide guidance for satisfactory implementation 
of the resolution of the mid-term party conference and other 
resolutions of the National Assembly's fourth session with the 
aim of achieving at least an 8-percent increase in this year's 
economic growth rate and creating potential for achieving a 
long-lasting double-digit growth rate with high results, so as 
to gradually narrow the gap in development compared with nearby 
countries. Only by unfailingly overcoming the danger of being 
left behind further economically can we achieve firm 
sociopolitical stability, strengthen national security and 
defense, and further develop our foreign relations on the basis 
of independence and sovereignty. 
  In this spirit, I would like to further elaborate on some 
major issues with which we are experiencing difficulties and on 
which we must revamp our policies so as to satisfactorily 
implement the tasks for 1994 and prepare for 1995: 
  1. Continue to ameloriate and stabilize the financial and 
monetary market: 
  A. How to balance the budget? 
  The report of the Finance Ministry points out difficulties 
encountered in balancing the budget. Compared with the figures 
in the first four months of the year, the average monthly 
figures achieved in the last six months of the year show that 
our revenue and expenses increased 1.5 fold and 1.66 fold 
respectively. 
  The fact that the National Assembly has ratified a request 
to 
increase revenue collection to meet our budget demands is a 
guarantee for the implementation of socioeconomic and national 
defense tasks and for helping contain inflation. 
  The conference held by the entire tax sector in mid-May 
decided that we are capable of a 10-percent increase in tax 
collection compared with the total tax and fee collection 
budgeted for the first half of the year. If we take into 
account the possibility of increasing tariff collection by the 
customs sector, we may exceed the collection target by 15 
percent. The feasibility of this target relies on our potential 
for developing production and expanding commercial exchange, 
along with efforts to enforce various tax laws and the 
discipline on budget contributions. We must overcome the tax 
collection shortfall, which is still great, in the state 
business sector, in individual and private ventures, and in 
those joint ventures with foreign countries. This shortfall 
also results from a failure to turn in the tax money obtained 
from home sales and land use. The enforcement of important laws 
and regulations is the most important task in which 
administrative and financial organs at various levels must 
closely cooperate with various mass organizations, professional 
associations, and the people in ensuring scrupulous and fair 
enforcement. 
  We must exploit the potential for increased tax collection 
in 
the following directions: 
  -- The export-import tax is not only a huge source of 
revenue 
for our budget -- accounting for one-fourth of our total revenue 
-- but also an important means of ensuring domestic production. 
Along with readjusting the tax table for exports and imports in 
accordance with the resolution adopted in late March by the 
National Assembly Standing Committee, we must intensify our 
anti-smuggling activities at various border gates and conduct 
inspections to obtain delinquent taxes on those products which 
have already been illicitly imported, especially those goods 
that may diminish domestic production. This task must be 
closely organized, directed, and undertaken with specific 
targets. To implement it, we must have cooperation between 
various sectors and we must win the sympathy and support of the 
people. 
  -- The leasing of land or the transfer of the land-use right 
and the use of state-owned houses for business purposes will not 
only generate huge amounts of revenue but also ensure better 
management and use of these properties. Although in practice 
this task is very complex, the more we procrastinate or adopt a 
wait-and-see attitude, the more state property will be gnawed 
off and abused. The government advocates undertaking this task 
resolutely and openly in a way suitable to the actual conditions 
so the people can oversee it. 
  -- We must scrutinize and sternly deal with those cases of 
illegal land allocation or land sales in which proceeds are not 
turned in to the government. 
  -- The prices of certain kinds of goods, which are either 
fixed or controlled by the state and are not suitable to the 
relations of supply and demand, such as gasoline and oil, 
electricity, cement, and the like, must be readjusted rationally 
so as to help economize on consumption and to achieve a balance 
between supply and demand and, at the same time, increase 
revenue for the budget. 
  Increased revenue should be coupled with reducced 
expenditure as stipulated by the National Assembly resolutions, 
with the goal of reducing budgetary strain. In implementing the 
National Assembly resolutions and the government decisions on 
practicing thrift, by mid-May there have been 47 ministries and 
central level agencies and 17 provinces and cities to actually 
draw up plans to practice thrift. According to the plans of the 
10 ministries that have been inspected, the amount of the 
projected expenditure reduction is 1.357 trillion dong, 
including 382 billion in capital construction, 943 billion in 
production and trade, and 32 billion in administrative 
expenditures. 
  The government urges all sectors and localities to complete 
their plans to practice thrift. The plans need to be calculated 
carefully and be concretely feasible. The Ministry of Finance 
will have to study the accounting and set up guidelines for 
using the money saved in its role of helping to ensure a 
balanced budget. The major expenditures, especially those for 
capital construction projects, must be allocated reasonably in 
accordance with the real-life situation of budget revenue. In 
the current situation, we are not allowed to consider 
expenditures for out-of-plan projects. Expenditures for new 
policies, new positions, and so forth should depend on actual 
revenue increases. We should actively try to expand our 
borrowing ability, either from foreign sources or from the 
people, to cover our investment and development needs. We 
should develop medium- and long-term borrowing plans with 
interest rates which can attract people's savings and which are 
in good accordance with bank loan interest rates. 
  B. Continue to maintain the fiscal stability and 
single-digit inflation rate: 
  The value of the dong is influenced by two things. On the 
one hand there are reasons for prices to go up and the 
purchasing power of the dong to go down. Increase expenditure 
in the coming months will cause demand to increase during the 
last several months of the year. A large inflow of foreign 
currency from various sources will increase the circulating 
money supply and push demand for goods up, thus creating more 
pressure for higher prices. On the other hand, the difficulties 
caused by the lack of a consuming market and from the 
competition of goods smuggled from overseas can also cause 
prices of agricultural products and some consumer goods to drop 
significantly. The large foreign currency inflow will also make 
the value of the dong increase slightly, thus weakening 
production and export activities. 
  We need to accelerate our production activities and increase 
domestic and international trade. At the same time, we need to 
be well aware of keeping supply and demand balanced, intervening 
as necessary to maintain inflation at the single-digit level. We 
should try to avoid any sudden fluctuations in prices of goods, 
services, gold, and the dollar, either increases or decreases. 
The unreasonable disparity in prices between agricultural 
products and industrial ones should be overcome. The government 
is in the process of adjusting foreign currency management 
policy aiming at stabilizing the realistic exchange rates on one 
hand, and on the other limiting the large use of the dollar 
domestically, first in credit and payment transactions between 
business establishments and banks. Conditions should be created 
for the gradual implementation of the principle that the should 
dong only be used in Vietnam. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Part three" of the report by Deputy Prime Minister Phan </F>
Van Khai at the opening of the Ninth National Assembly's Fifth 
Session held at the Ba Dinh Conference Hall in Hanoi on 26 May 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] While planning and preparing for the implementation 
of resolutions to be introduced by the upcoming central level 
meeting on the direction of industrialization and modernization 
industrial development through the year 2000, it is necessary to 
strive to satisfactorily execute this year's plans for 
investment development in order to create momentum for 
subsequent years. 
  A. Investment capital for development is a priority issue. 
Together with active efforts to obtain and efficiently use 
foreign capital for investment, the government is issuing 
guidance to supplement policies and measures to mobilize more 
domestic capital and to gradually create a capital market. 
Interests are slowly and reasonably adjusted together with the 
introduction of variable and attractive forms to mobilize 
capital from different resources. Insurance funds and consumer 
credit funds are to be developed. A credit policy to provide 
capital based on economic effectiveness but not on economic 
sectors is to be applied in order to progressively create a 
environment of competition in the credit sector. Financial 
markets from low to high levels will be established with the 
increasing availability of bonds and stocks. The government is 
considering introducing a law on shares and stock market 
operations and preparing the necessary conditions for a healthy 
stock market in our country. 
  B. We will actively provide enough capital for important 
projects in the 1994 planning, especially the projects that have 
suffered shortages of capital. We will ensure the progress of 
electricity- generating projects. This year, we will put into 
partial service the Thac Mo hydroelectric project and the Vinh 
Son hydroelectric project, start construction of the Yali 
hydroelectric power station, and prepare for construction of the 
Phy My thermal power station, the Ham Thuan-Da Mi hydroelectric 
project, and expansion of the Pha Lai thermal power station. In 
transportation, we will rebuild the national highways Nos. 5 and 
1 and the South Thang Long-Ba Dinh highways to connect with the 
North Thang Long-Noi Bai highways. Regarding water conservation, 
we will carry out such major projects as the (Gong) River, Thach 
Nham, Rac, and A Yun Ha projects. It is noteworthy is that we 
have completed the natural gas pipeline project from the Bach Ho 
oil field to Ba Ria. Plans have been formulated to expand the 
Hoang Thach cement factory, build the But Son cement plant, 
expand the Bim Son cement factory, and so forth. Efforts are 
being made to ensure sufficient capital for these projects. All 
projects built with capital provided or loaned by the state or 
by foreign countries must be carried out seriously in accordance 
with the government's new regulations on strengthening 
management, opposing waste, and overcoming negativism in the 
various stages of construction from the drawing of blueprints, 
through the bidding process, contract signing, inspection, and 
final acceptance of the projects. We must strive to complete 
various communications and transport projects in accordance with 
the set policy and schedule. 
  C. We must create favorable conditions for accelerating 
investment by various economic components in society, and strive 
to encourage enterprises and families to invest in developing 
production and business while promoting the capital market. The 
law on encouraging investment at home, to be submitted to the 
National Assembly at this session, has been formulated on the 
basis of providing the most favorable status to domestic 
investment projects, similar to those of foreign investment 
projects. The enforcement of this law requires an amendment to 
some articles of other promulgated laws such and the Law on Land 
and other laws related to taxation. 
  Various documents aimed at providing guidance for law 
enforcement are being written for promulgation. This will help 
to accelerate the application of various laws in daily life, 
thereby meeting requests by various business establishments. 
  D. While implementing the investment policy, we must quickly 
formulate plans to develop economic sectors and branches, 
especially those related to infrastructure projects, 
agricultural branches in localities and cities, goods processing 
centers, and industrial complexes in each region and province. 
We must strive to build more infrastructure projects to meet 
requirements of the construction and completion of these 
industrial complexes. 
  These plans provide the groundwork for the rational 
formulation of important state-funded investment projects. They 
also direct and assist Vietnamese and foreign investors in 
overcoming situations where investment is made spontaneously and 
subsequently leads to overlapping work, conflicts, and poor 
returns on investment. 
  Third, it is necessary to step up diplomatic activities and 
broaden external economic relations. The current situation 
provides us with the opportunity to strengthen foreign relations 
to accelerate national development and enhance the ability to 
safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. At 
the same time, it contains factors of instability and the danger 
of causing us to be left farther behind. Complicated and 
sensitive external relations require us to be more vigilant, 
dynamic, and creative in the implementation of a foreign policy 
of independence and sovereignty to bring into full play the 
strength of the entire nation in combination with international 
strength in order to cope with challenges and take advantage of 
opportunities to develop the national industrialization and 
modernization program a step further. 
  We are actively settling outstanding issues and disputes 
with 
some countries gradually and through peaceful negotiations. We 
are ready to proceed to normalization with the United States, 
join ASEAN at an early date, enter into multi-sided cooperation 
in the Pacific region, and at the same time continue 
consolidating and expanding cooperation with all countries and 
international organizations. 
  Together with the enhancement of state-level relations, it 
is 
necessary to develop cooperative ties in the economic, 
scientific, technical, and cultural fields; expand cooperation 
with non-governmental organizations and business people; step up 
people-to-people contacts; and enhance foreign information and 
propaganda services. 
  The government is preparing an overall project for 
developing 
external economic relations in the new situation. Some key 
tasks that must be done between now and the end of the year are 
as follows: 
  a. Guiding the implementation of new regulations on managing 
and distributing Official Development Assistance (ODA). Many 
countries and international organizations committed to provide 
necessary financial aid provided that this aid is used strictly 
in accordance with stringent quality control requirements. 
Therefore, along with seriously implementing previously funded 
projects, it is necessary to see to it that new projects are 
properly worked out because this constitutes the key conditions 
for using or gaining more aid to meet specified goals. The 
State Planning Committee is responsible for improving cadre 
skills and directing sectors and localities in formulating 
ODA-funded projects in combination with other sources of 
investment capital, bearing in mind the need to build 
socioeconomic infrastructure and zone off targeted areas and 
domains of activities. First priority must be given to the use 
of non-refundable ODA to fund projects that benefit localities 
with many difficulties. 
  b. Continuing to improve the environment to attract direct 
foreign investment. As an immediate objective, urgent efforts 
must be made to improve investment procedures and other foreign 
investment-related regulations, especially procedures on land 
leasing, construction, taxation, and paperwork simplification to 
make them administratively simple but legally solid. 
  Steps must be taken to reduce the time needed for license 
application and removing obtacles that stand in the way of 
implementing approved projects. Particularly, when it comes to 
land leasing, site clearance cost, housing rental, and postage, 
we must take into consideration the average charges set by 
neighboring countries. Generally speaking, as far as our 
country is concerned, land leasing, housing rental, and postage 
are higher than the charges set by neighboring countries. 
  All sectors and localities must implement laws and legal 
documents relating to these matters in a uniform and serious 
manner. It is necessary to conduct educational activities and 
inspections to make sure that cadres overcome the evils of red 
tape. It is important to try by all means to contain the ills 
of bureaucratism and attempts to seek bribes because these moves 
inconvenience and discourage foreign investors. 
  We must focus on the experiences drawn during the past to 
review and improve work on sectors, production establishments, 
and key projects that need foreign capital. It is necessary to 
formulate plans for building foreign investment centers, 
especially in the three key economic areas. We must amend and 
supplement various policies to encourage and attract more 
foreign investment, especially in regions with numerous 
difficulties. Efforts must be made to promulgate regulations on 
the management of enterprises with foreign capital toward 
developing the private sector role and responsibility, while 
ensuring the management function of the state and authorized 
agencies in accordance with the law. We must strive to avoid 
applying management through a single administrative agency. 
  C. The government set a policy on export-import early this 
year. Its implementation, however, has been very slow. As a 
result, we must strive to overcome this shortcoming while 
strengthening the supervision in export-import activities. 
Efforts must be made to regulate domestic demands on essential 
goods while preventing prices from acute fluctuations. 
Regarding the foreign exchange rates, we must strive to 
stabilize the actual rate to protect the interests of exporters 
while stabilizing the macro-economy. The actual foreign 
exchange rate rests with the purchasing power of the Vietnamese 
dong and foreign currencies calculated on the basis of the 
current rate of inflation and demand for foreign currencies in 
the market. The Ministry of Trade must formulate concrete plans 
to coordinate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and 
various export-import associations to find more foreign markets 
for our goods, especially agricultural products. It must 
conduct research on the market situation at home and abroad to 
provide producers, businessmen, exporters, and importers with 
accurate information related to their businesses. Our 
export-based industrialization strategy calls for a renovation 
in foreign trade relations so as to quickly increase our export 
value. This must be carried out in close association with the 
efforts to develop the exported goods pattern and fundamentally 
change the business activities and export-import management. 
Efforts must also be made to shift from the rigid administrative 
management system to the application of an active economic 
measure. The Ministry of Trade must strive to perfect 
regulations on renovating foreign trade management to solicit 
ideas from businessmen during the next several months. On this 
basis, we will gradually form a unified management system to 
stabilize export-import activities. 
  D. Regarding our tourism, this sector is in great demand by 
tourists at home and abroad. We have great, favorable 
conditions for developing this sector. As a result, capital 
invested in this domain will be recovered quickly with a high 
rate of interest. Moreover, we have great advantage in having 
good geographic conditions, beautiful scenery, and numerous 
cultural and historical relics. It is necessary to say here, 
however, that although we are attaining high growth in tourism, 
various aspects of this sector are not developing well enough to 
meet current demands and requirements. Efforts must be make to 
quickly overcome the shortage of hotels and accommodations for 
foreign guests in Hanoi. The tourism sector must strive to meet 
all requirements of foreign guests and provide them with better 
service. It must strive to increase its income while expanding 
cooperation relations with foreign countries so as to contribute 
to developing the national economy. In implementing the 
government resolution on developing tourism, we must immediately 
accelerate the building of hotels and tourist centers using 
capital, first of all, from economic sectors at home in various 
forms. The tourism sector must coordinate with the 
transportation and other sectors, especially airline companies, 
the customs department, and other agencies to meet the 
requirements of various service activities. The security and 
consular agencies must formulate regulations to effectively 
coordinate with other organizations to provide the best service 
for foreign guests while ensuring their safety ,as well as 
social order and discipline.

<F P=106> ["Part Four" of the report by Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van </F>
Khai at the opening of the Ninth National Assembly's Fifth 
Session held at the Ba Dinh Conference Hall in Hanoi on 26 May 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] The government has confirmed these as key tasks in 
its program of actions. In the beginning of this year, the 
government met with the chairmen of people's committees and 
people's councils to discuss the execution of these tasks. In 
providing guidance for the implementation of the National 
Assembly resolution, a working regulation for better 
coordination between the prime minister, National Assembly 
chairman, the chief justice of the Supreme People's Court, and 
chief of the Supreme People's Organ of Control was established 
by the National Assembly Standing Committee. Therefore, the 
investigation and dealing with all cases of violation and 
offenders have been proceeding at a faster pace. In 13 major 
legal cases in 1993 handled directly by the central organs, 12 
cases have been tried. The government has also accelerated the 
changing and supplement of its regulations and policies, 
especially in dealing with construction investment, the 
establishing of state budget targets, and market management. 
  Regarding anti-corruption work, the number of corruption 
cases discovered in the first four months of this year is less 
than that of the same period last year. However, corruption is 
still serious, and occurs mainly in the transferring and selling 
of houses and land, the spending and collection of state budget, 
the handling of money of state enterprises, the management of 
foreign aid, in the demand for bribes in the administration, in 
commodity control, and traffic control. 
  The number of smuggling cases discovered and dealt with in 
the first four months of this year is three percent more than 
the same period last year with the value of confiscated goods at 
25 percent more than that of last year. Cross border and 
airline smuggling cases have decreased but smuggling by the sea 
route has been increasing and is becoming more serious and 
complex. 
  Noteworthy is the recent legalization and registration of 
illegally imported cars and motorcycles by some provinces after 
the collection of a small amount of tax. The government is 
investigating people's committees and related organs in these 
provinces. In the coming period, it is necessary to closely 
coordinate the execution of the National Assembly resolution 
with on-going programs for economic and administrative reform to 
cope with emerging phenomena and gradually solve fundamental 
issues relating to regulations and mechanism. 
  The result of our efforts depends firstly on the 
responsibility and conscientiousness of heads of government 
organs from the central to grassroots levels and the role of all 
mass organizations in each locality. What is abnormal is that 
most of the corruption and smuggling cases have not been 
discovered by organs and units where the offenders used to work. 
Therefore, it is necessary to heighten the responsibility of 
party organs, government, and mass organizations in all sectors 
and echelons, beginning with the education and control of party 
members and cadres to uncover and deal with all cases of 
violation. The government also suggests that National Assembly 
deputies and National Assembly constituent groups strengthen 
their supervisory role in this task, especially in their working 
place and their constituents. 
  The government welcomes the positive contribution of all 
mass 
media agencies in this fight. It is hoped that newspapers and 
radios will carry out more satisfactority their roles as defined 
by the Press Law. It is also hoped that they will also strive 
to overcome the shortcomings in their reporting, and thus 
contribute to further accelerating the movement to combine the 
voice of the press, public opinion, and the responsibility of 
state organs to increase the strength and efficiency of this 
struggle. 
  Fifth, we must broaden and heighten the result of our 
scientific, educational, cultural, and social activities. In 
our striving to execute the 1994 program of actions for the 
successful implementation of the National Assembly resolution, 
all related sections must have better improvements, especially 
in the mountainous and isolated areas. For ethnic people, the 
economic issue is attached even more closely to the cultural and 
social aspects. The government funding for investment in 
mountainous and ethnic areas has clearly manifested that 
relationship. This funding must be used correctly and 
efficiently to create conditions that would allow the 
mountainous people to take advantage of their local situation to 
eliminate starvation, reduce poverty, gradually enrich 
themselves, improve their intelligence, and reduce disease and 
drug addiction. 
  It is necessary to make preparations for the 1994-95 new 
school year while at the same time continuing to increase the 
number of students at all levels and create conditions for more 
children to attend school. Greater efforts are needed to 
improve the quality of education and training. Plans must be 
worked out to adjust the objectives of primary education and 
give general education school students more access to elective 
courses or subjects. Steps must be taken to renovate the 
contents of social science and humanities. Plans must be worked 
out to stabilize the organization and operations of the national 
university and the three newly established regional universities 
at an early date. Urgent measures are needed to prepare for the 
establishment of the Ho Chi Minh City National University. 
  It is necessary to see to it that scientific and 
technological research contributes positively to the formulation 
of industrialization and modernization strategies and of 
sectorial or regional development projects, as well as to the 
assessment of the renovation process. It is important to see to 
it that scientific and technological research projects focus on 
targeted areas, be consistent with socioeconomic development 
projects, and yield practical results. It is necessary to 
uphold the sense of responsibility of state management agencies 
when it comes to technology imports assessment and inspection. 
It is important to implement the regulations on product 
quality, take measures against contraband, and enforce the law 
on environmental protection. Special efforts must be made to 
reduce pollution in the urban areas. Steps must be taken to 
improve the environment in the countryside. 
  Regarding cultural and information services, the purposes of 
the three state-level programs are to renovate historical relics 
to prevent them from further deterioration, organize and promote 
cultural and information services at grassroots establishments 
and in the countryside, and consolidate and expand 
cinematography. It is necessary to link these three programs to 
diversified activities to mark major anniversaries, bearing in 
mind the need to make these activities attractive to broad 
sections of the population. At the same time, it is necessary 
to improve the overall quality of artistic programs and cultural 
products. Continued efforts are needed to gradually modernize 
radio and television networks and strengthen culture and art 
management through the law to ensure strict implementation of 
regulations and rules that are in effect. 
  As far as public health care is concerned, efforts must be 
concentrated more on grassroots establishments. Measures must 
be taken to get rid of the situation in which medical care and 
treatment is nonexistent at certain villages. It is necessary 
to implement disease control and prevention programs 
satisfactorily, fight child malnutrition, and improve the 
quality of medical care and treatment. At the same time, it is 
necessary to adjust the system of hospital fees and medical 
insurance premiums, start the construction of two special 
medical centers in Hanoi Municipality and Ho Chi Minh City, 
formulate a national policy on medicine, perfect pharmaceutical 
development projects and medical equipment development projects, 
consolidate the management of state agencies over public 
healthcare provision, and enforce the regulations governing 
medical and pharmaceutical practices by the private sector. 
  Prompt measures must be taken to expand the population 
activities and family planning network down to villages and 
wards and combine propaganda activities with efforts to broaden 
services, thus increasing the number of people who wish to 
adopt contraceptive methods to reduce the percentage of families 
with a third child. 
  Regarding physical education and sports activities, it is 
necessary to pay due attention to the masses' movement, work out 
positive measures to build the contingent of athletes, and 
organize physical education and sports congresses at all levels 
in anticipation of the 1995 national physical education and 
sports congress. Vietnamese athletes must participate 
positively in international and regional contests and must 
improve their achievements, especially at the Asian Games 
scheduled for late 1994. 
  It is necessary to enhance the results of social welfare 
programs, especially job development programs and hunger 
elimination and poverty reduction programs. Care must be given 
to children who have nobody to turn to in time of need. It is 
necessary to make preparations for the promulgation of the 
regulations on favors to be done to those who have rendered 
meritorious services. Adequate arrangements must be made to 
relocate the burial sites of fallen combatants. Plans must be 
worked out to maintain and expand the movement to show gratitude 
to those who have rendered meritorious services. 
  Measures must be taken to implement programs to eliminate 
the 
evils of prostitution, drug addiction, and HIV infection, 
bearing in mind the need to guarantee close and uninterrupted 
direction of party committee echelons and administrative organs 
at all levels, especially at ward and village levels. It is 
necessary to secure routine and constant coordination among 
administrative organs, front organizations, and the mass media. 
It is necessary to attach due importance to educational 
activities and preventive measures in combination with necessary 
legal action.

<F P=106> ["Part Five, Last Part" of the report by Deputy Prime </F>
Minister Phan Van Khai at the opening of Ninth National 
Assembly's Fifth Session held at the Ba Dinh Conference Hall in 
Hanoi on 26 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] We must strive to accelerate economic reform in 
close association with administrative reform. 
  To meet the requirements of the new development stage and 
the 
renovation, it is essential for us to formulate a general plan 
to more vigorously accelerate economic reform, while striving to 
improve the state management mechanism, especially national 
administration. 
  Given the tasks that have been and are being done, and on 
the 
basis of the government's 1994 program of action, we must 
concentrate efforts to carry out the following tasks to 
accelerate our economic and administrative reform: 
  A. Formulate a plan to fundamentally reform our financial 
and 
banking system. Regarding the financial sector, we must 
establish and apply the new accounting system to suit the market 
economy within this year, while accurately presenting our assets 
and business activities. We must make greater efforts to ensure 
that our accounting system is a reliable inspection tool of our 
state and society, while we strive to develop our auditing 
system. Efforts must be made to complete draft laws and other 
inventories to systematize various principles concerning the 
establishment, examination, scrutiny, and approval of the state 
budget. We must delegate authority in the allocation of the 
state budget and set up a machinery to supervise, inspect, and 
control it. It is essential to carry out the program to study 
and fundamentally reform the tax collection system to suit the 
new stage of economic reform. We must build a new mechanism to 
manage assets at various enterprises. 
  We must formulate a plan to continue reforming the banking 
sector and fully establish and delegate authority in 
implementing a two-level banking system, namely state banking 
and commercial banking. Efforts must be made to gradually 
establish the money market by using various essential 
apparatuses to regulate the circulation of money, while ensuring 
suitable bank interest rates for the market economy. We must 
strive to ensure fair foreign exchange rates, develop the 
management of foreign currencies, and create a competitive 
atmosphere to enhance the efficiency of banking services. We 
must also strive to diversify the forms of debt by using the 
most modern methods, while ensuring that the bank functions as a 
reliable debt settlement center. 
  Plans for the above tasks are being formulated by the 
agencies concerned. These plans are expected to be completed 
this year and efforts will be made to amend and supplement them 
during their implementation. 
  B. We must continue to rearrange, improve, and enhance the 
efficiency of state enterprises and shift them into the business 
environment of the market economy. State enterprises, in making 
profits in the market system, should strive to meet public 
demands, while competing with other economic establishments in a 
healthy manner. These enterprises should set up a separate 
state management mechanism to strengthen their operations. We 
must issue guidance and implementation documents on these tasks 
by this year. We must also strive to complete the second phase 
of our debt settlement by this year, while continuing to deal 
with enterprises that are still operating at a loss. We must 
accelerate the application of the new accounting system in close 
association with the effort to improve the financial system of 
enterprises to enable them to take real responsibility in 
managing financial matters within the framework of the law. We 
must strive to limit the business monopoly of state enterprises, 
while creating conditions for healthy competition. We must 
improve the communications and transport network further this 
year. For a number of enterprises that still need to operate in 
a monopoly, the state should set up a separate management 
mechanism to control them. 
  The above measures and the efforts to carry out the 
financial 
and banking reform will create conditions for each enterprise to 
effectively renovate itself, while taking appropriate actions to 
compete with other establishments in the market. The market 
economic system will help determine the efficiency of 
enterprises, accelerate and develop various forms of 
cooperation, promote the spirit of self-reliance, and create 
conditions for the setting up of major business corporations. 
In this context, it will gradually help to improve and 
fundamentally strengthen various state enterprises, promote the 
share-holding system, and clearly define direct ownership of 
public assets at state enterprises. It will also help form a 
new management mechanism to replace the old administrative 
management system at enterprises. From this juncture, we will 
be able to establish a state business bloc comprising various 
major business corporations to effectively carry out business 
activities and truly develop the autonomy of the market system. 
The state should formulate a legal framework to guide and 
support the implementation of this process to help it develop 
along the socialist orientation and in conformity with the law 
of the market. 
  The efforts to carry out pilot projects in the 
implementation of state policies to promote the share-holding 
system and to eliminate the state managing system at enterprises 
are aimed at drawing experiences from realities to correctly 
apply them in the market economy. 
  C. While carrying out the abovementioned two tasks, we will, 
at the same time integrate the economic reform with that of the 
administration. Administration reform, however, requires 
greater efforts because it is closely related to the renovation 
of the political system. Moreover, many major and fundamental 
issues in the administrative reform stem from the process of 
building a law-governed state of Vietnam which we are studying 
its contents for submission to the next party Central Committee 
plenum to be convened at the end of this year [time as heard]. 
  It is imperative for us to resolve now a number of pressing 
issues, to create conditions for developing the relationship 
between organizations and state agencies, and to enhance the 
efficiency of our administrative system. Efforts must be made 
to improve administrative procedures to eliminate inconveniences 
experienced by the people and businessmen. The recent 
government's resolution on this issue has been warmly welcomed 
by the people. Various ministries, government agencies, and 
people's committees of provinces and cities are dutybound to 
implement this resolution. Heads of responsible agencies must 
control and closely supervise the implementation of this 
resolution to affect real changes. Criticism by the press, 
pressure by public opinion, and action by the people aimed at 
improving administrative procedures and inspecting work of state 
agencies and personnel are significant factors that will help 
accelerate administrative reform. At present, the government is 
making great efforts to formulate regulations on civil servants, 
conduct a study on public service system, and make preparations 
to set up a financial-administrative agency. The government 
will complete within this year the draft documents for these 
tasks to solicit ideas from various sectors before promulgation. 
  There are still many issues to be resolved regarding the 
relationship between the central and local agencies in a uniform 
administrative system. Significant parts of these issues have 
been raised in the draft law on the people's councils and 
people's committees, the draft law on state budget, and the law 
on authority to promulgate legal documents. These issues cannot 
be resolved separately, but rather they must be settled on the 
basis of the general lines and policies on building a 
law-governed state. 
  The most pressing tasks at present are to restore 
disciplines 
in the administrative system and resolutely deal with agencies 
that deliberately ignore the decisions and directives of the 
government and the higher administration echelons. Chiefs of 
the the higher administrative agencies must strive to supervise 
and control the implementation of key decisions, promptly 
commend outstanding officials, and quickly deal with cadres who 
violate rules and regulations. 
  Dear National Assembly deputies, implementing the 1994 tasks 
during the past almost six months, we have found that we now 
have numerous opportunities to advance forward while facing some 
ordeals. This condition will pave the way for our nation to 
enter the new stage of development. Thanks to the fine 
development of the socioeconomic situation, our people's 
material and spiritual life has been further improved and social 
activities enhanced. This has been symbolized by the creativity 
and efficiency of various enterprises and businessmen, families 
in the delta and mountain regions, and people in the 
countryside. These sources of strength and intelligence can be 
exploited more vigorously through the continuation of the 
renovation process, especially in the efforts to accelerate 
economic reform in close association with the administrative 
reform. This will also serve as a basis for effective 
competition with and exploitation of foreign resources. 
  In the new situation, the implementation of the policy on 
strengthening great national unity has reached a new peak in 
anticipation of the upcoming congress of the Vietnam Fatherland 
Front. We must strive to bring into full play all capabilities 
and efforts by Vietnamese at home and abroad for the great cause 
of the nation. This will undoubtedly open up a new prospect for 
attaining the objectives of making our people prosperous, our 
nation powerful, and our society just and civilized. 
  In this spirit, the government, the National Assembly, the 
Vietnam Fatherland Front, and other mass organizations, in their 
respective role and duty will strive to organize, motivate, 
lead, and assist the people to make greater efforts to fulfill 
the 1994 tasks set by the National Assembly's resolutions, 
thereby satisfactorily creating a firm foundation for effective 
implementation of other tasks in 1995 and the ensuing years.

  [Text] Dear friends: Today, 30 May, is the fourth working 
day of the Ninth National Assembly. In the morning, the 
deputies broke into groups and discussed the draft law on taxes 
levied on the transfer of rights on land use. In these group 
discussions, they also offered views on the draft regulation on 
rights and obligations of organizations over their granted and 
rented land and the draft regulation on rights and obligations 
of foreign individuals and organizations over their rented land 
in Vietnam. 
  In the afternoon, the National Assembly held a plenary 
session in the conference hall under the direction of National 
Assembly Vice Chairman Nguyen Ha Phan to discuss the draft law 
on taxes levied on the transfer of rights on land use. The 
draft law consists of six chapters with 26 articles. 
  As of noon, the National Assembly Secretariat received 29 
reports on the discussion of the draft law on taxes levied on 
the transfer of rights on land use held by all the groups. 
  In the afternoon, they took turns to present their views on 
the draft law. All of them agreed that it is necessary to 
promulgate a law on taxes levied on the transfer of rights on 
land use in order to improve land management, strictly implement 
the law on land promulgated on 15 October 1993, and increase 
revenue for the state budget. 
  The expressed opinions concentrated on the following issues: 
the subjects to the law on taxes levied on the transfer of 
rights on land use, the basis for tax rate calculation, 
exemptions to the law, and the date the law will become 
effective. 
  Most of the deputies agreed with the draft law on the 
subjects to the law as they are all individuals and 
organizations. Some deputies suggested that it should be 
clearly specified that organizations are economic organizations. 
However, some opinions suggested that the word organizations in 
the draft law should be removed for the reason that land is 
granted to organizations by the government. When the land is 
not used, it must be returned to the government. 
  Some deputies suggested that there should be a 
classification 
for individuals and organizations that receive their rights on 
land use before and after 1975. Before 1975, the people had to 
pay for their rights of land use. But now the people can be 
granted the right to land use free. Therefore, it is not fair 
when they are classified in the same category. 
  Most of the deputies agreed with a suggestion to grant tax 
exemptions to families of fallen combatants; injured soldiers of 
class one and class two; and cadres, workers, and public 
servants deployed to work in other localities. Other opinions 
also proposed that tax exemptions should also be reduced for 
sick soldiers of class one. Tax exemptions or reductions, 
however, should not be granted when people move to other 
residential areas of their choice. 
  Some opinions said that it is necessary to encourage people, 
who turn fallow land into agricultural land or use land along 
the national border and on islands for production activity, with 
appropriate tax privileges. Most of the deputies held that the 
proposed tax scale is too high. They suggested that the maximum 
rate should not be set at 20 percent as outlined in the draft 
law. The rates should be set at 5, 10, and 15 percent. The 
deputies agreed with the draft law that the people's committees 
of provinces and cities directly subordinated to the central 
government must set appropriate rates for their own areas, based 
on the guidelines issued by the government and on the local 
situation and provided that their rates do not exceed more than 
20 percent of the guidelines. 
  A deputy voiced his query that the draft law stipulates that 
tax payers must pay their tax where their land is located. What 
will happen if a person transfers his rights on land use and 
another person receives the rights on land use reside in 
different localities? 
  Somebody suggested that taxes should be reduced on a piece 
of 
land that has been transferred more than two times. But 
somebody else suggested that in this case the tax should be many 
times higher in order to stop the trading of land for profit, 
thus preventing the increase of land prices. 
  Many deputies suggested deleting article four calling 
organizations and individuals to support the taxation service in 
its execution of the law on taxes levied on the transfer of 
rights on land use. Other deputies proposed that this article 
should be put together with article 15 about participation, 
reward, and punishment. 
  Most of the expressed opinions suggested that the law on 
taxes levied on the transfer of rights on land use should come 
into effect on the day that the law is promulgated and it should 
be retroactive to 15 October 1993, the promulgation date of the 
Law on Land. 
  Tomorrow, the National Assembly will continue its debate in 
the conference hall.

  [Text] Dear friends; On the fifth working day of the 
Ninth National Assembly's fifth session at the conference hall, 
deputies continued to discuss the draft law on tax for the 
transfer of land use rights and heard a report on the draft 
amendment to the laws on organization and the election of 
people's councils. 
  In the morning, the deputies listened to Mr. Ho Te, minister 
of finance and chairman of draft law compilation committee, who 
read a report summarizing the views of deputies on the draft law 
on the transfer tax on land use rights. Seventeen deputies gave 
their opinions on this draft law. Most of their views focused 
on major issues such as targeted parties, the basis for tax 
calculation, tax rates, tax reduction and exemption, and an 
effective time frame of the law. 
  Those who voiced their views held that in order to maintain 
fairness, the calculation of tax must be based on the source of 
the land. They also agreed that tax reduction and exemption 
must be given to state cadres and employees who have to move 
house as required by public service, and also for those who have 
completed their service in mountainous provinces and who have 
decided to return to their hometowns for retirement. 
  In terms of tax rates, many deputies suggested the rate of 
five percent for the mountainous and coastal provinces so as to 
encourage investment. Others suggested that the transfer of 
agricultural land use right must be limited to preventing land 
from being used for other purposes. These limitation must be 
stated clearly in the regulations to avoid loss of public funds, 
and also to avoid negativity in the management mechanism. 
Others held the view that distinctions should not be made 
between the transfer of land use rights and a change in the way 
land is used. With this, the National Assembly deputies have 
completed their discussion of the draft law on the transfer tax 
on land use rights. 
  In the afternoon, the National Assembly deputies heard 
Comrade Phan Ngoc Tuong, minister chairman of state organization 
and personnel commission, acting on behalf of the government, 
read a report on the amendment of the people's councils and 
people's committees, and the amendment draft on the law on 
election of people's councils. They also heard Comrade Ha Manh 
Tri read an investigative report on the two draft amendments on 
laws regarding the organization of the people's councils and 
election of people's councils. 
  The deputies will hold group discussions tomorrow morning on 
the draft laws on organization and the election of people's 
councils to prepare for the plenary session at the conference 
hall in the afternoon.

  [Text] In Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and some other 
localities, there have been many cases recently in which 
foreigners used counterfeit U.S. dollars in selling and 
purchasing transactions, and some buyers have been given 
counterfeit U.S. dollars. 
  The Interior Ministry has directed its related departments 
to 
coordinate with local police forces and other agencies to work 
out approriate plans to prevent and discover sources of 
counterfeit dollars in Vietnam. 
  In early March 1994, security forces received information on 
a large amount of counterfeit dollars circulating in the Hanoi 
area. The security forces joined efforts with local police in 
Lang Son to investigate all sources and suspects. After a month 
of investigation, the security forces discovered the culprit and 
confiscated 100,000 counterfeit U.S dollars in $100 bills. 
  The case has been transferred to relevant agency for 
prosecution.

  [Text] For Hmong people living in areas where a town 
centre is two days' walk away, opium is certainly a much more 
attractive and practical commodity than peanuts. 
  The Lai Chau provincial cadres have tried, in vain, to 
persuade them to grow peanuts instead of poppies. 
  The Vietnamese authorities find themselves increasingly 
helpless to deal with opium plantations and severe drug 
addiction among ethnic minorities in mountainous regions 
especially Lai Chau and Son La. 
  At the same time, increasing drug abuse in major lowland 
cities such as Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Hai Phong have pushed 
up demand for raw materials from the mountainous areas. 
  Vietnam has just encountered scenes familiar in northern 
Thailand and is trying to deal with a whole set of issues 
through the similar approach of crop substitution programmes and 
rehabilitating drug addicts while boosting law enforcement. 
  But the absence of laws relating to illicit drugs, combined 
with corruption among law enforcers, an erratic judicial system 
and a generally crumbling law enforcement situation, raise the 
question of how effectively the government will handle this 
issue for which a national programme, as well as an 
anti-narcotics bureau, have only been recently set up. 
  "We have a surplus of decrees and resolutions but what's 
been 
accomplished so far shows a lack of resolve. Police in Cao Bang 
province found 2.8 kilogrammes of opium but the trafficker was 
released after posting a bail of US$20. This is not to talk 
about some depraved policemen receiving bribes from other drug 
traffickers," said a critical article on this issue carried by 
Lao Dong (Labour) which is published by the Confederation of 
Trade Union. 
  It was not until September 1990 that the Lai Chau provincial 
authority took its own initiative to ban opium growing, smoking, 
trade and storage. 
  "We had to introduce the ban because our education campaign 
had failed," said Mai Thi Ly, deputy governor of Lai Chau 
province. She is of ethnic Hmong origin and these people form 
the largest group of opium growers in the region. 
  Last year, the Vietnamese government passed another 
resolution on illicit drugs which prescribed penalties for drug 
abuse and trafficking. 
  "That had very little impact," on the thriving situation in 
Lai Chau, said Mrs Ly in an interview. 
  "We have resorted to different methods of persuasion, urging 
people not to grow opium. The villagers who turn to cash crops 
said it was difficult for them to sell their products. The 
budget we received from Hanoi is strictly for seeds, but there's 
no money for road access," she said. 
  Opium addiction among ethnic minorities in remote provinces, 
especially in the north of Vietnam, is such that "in some 
places, the whole villages smoke opium, the whole families smoke 
opium including some children under 15," according to Deputy 
Minister Phan Thanh Xuan of the National Committee for Ethnic 
Minorities and Mountainous Areas. 
  The Vietnamese government said there were 150,000 drug 
addicts nationwide. Of the 12,000 drug addicts officially 
discovered in Lai Chau province, 1,600 of them were treated. 
  "Drug abuse is much more difficult to do away with than 
poppy 
fields. Of those rehabilitated, we found that most of them 
later return to the habit," said Mrs Ly. 
  In Lai Chau, the local authorities are grappling with the 
budgetary and logistical questions of relocating the provincial 
capital from Lai Chau to Dien Bien Phu. On the fringe of the 
town's only main road construction of the province's only drug 
addicts rehabilitation centre is under way. 
  The centre, located on what used to be the site of a herbal 
medicine clinic, began service in January this year and, so far, 
it has come across one intravenous drug user, according to 
Nguyen Duc Thien, director of the centre. 
  The opium area in Lai Chau province was more than 1,000 
hectares before 1990. Officials put the current estimate at 300 
hectares. Poppy field annihilation squads would roam the region 
during harvest time in September to wipe them out. 
  In the past, opium production and movement had been internal 
in that it satisfied small-scale needs within the province. But 
officials were alarmed to have intercepted for the first time 
last November 190 kilogrammes of opium from Laos en route to 
destinations outside the province. Early this year, another 230 
kilos from across the border was intercepted in Lai Chau. 
  "That stuff was on transit in Lai Chau, destined for Hanoi 
and Hai Phong. Until last November's case, we never found 
locals who moved more than five kilos of opium. In the 230 kilo 
case, the traffickers came from Hai Phong. They started 
operating some rackets here," said Deputy Governor Dy. 
  This is what causes the gravest concern for her. 
  "Local people here don't go to Hanoi to sell, but the people 
from outside, for instance, Hanoi come here to buy." 
  Vietnam is pondering accession to an international treaty on 
illicit drugs. Tracking down international drug cartels has 
been possible so far with cooperation from Interpol. The 
country has recently participated in two ASEAN programmes which 
will be implemented in Vietnam: Antinarcotics information; and 
the parents and children against drug abuse campaign. 
  Vietnam, which has no diplomatic relations with the US, 
hoped 
that one day it could hook up with the vast pool of resources 
and intelligence network of the US Drug Enforcement Agency, said 
Deputy Minister Xuan. 
  "We believe that cooperation with the US DEA would help 
reduce narcotics supply to their country," he said.

as authorized by the National Electricity Network Coordination 
Center in Hanoi, Engineer Tran Anh Thai performed the connecting 
operation at the 571st circuit breaker at the Danang 
500-kilovolt Transformer Station to connect the power network of 
the north to that of the south. 
  The operation went as the technicians planned. This is the 
most important operation in the process of construction and 
official utilization of the 500-kilovolt north-south power 
transmission network. To watch the operation successfully 
carried out, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, Energy Minister Thai 
Phung Ne, and Dang Huu, minister of Science, Technology, and 
Environment were present at the National Electricity Network 
Coordination Center. The prime minister made telephone calls to 
the Phu Lam and Danang Transformer Stations to talk to the 
cadres and workers and urged them to carry out their duties 
efficiently to ensure a smooth transmission between the north 
and south power networks. 
  At 18:54 local time [11:54 GMT], Mr. Tran Minh Tam, director 
of the National Electricity Network Coordination Center, 
reported to the prime minister that all technical conditions for 
connecting the two networks were fulfilled. The prime minister 
then gave his permission and Mr. Dang Hung, deputy director of 
the center gave the order to the Danang Transformer Station for 
the operation. 
  After the connecting operation, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
shook hands with and thanked more than 20 people present at the 
coordination center who are cadres in charge of the transmission 
operation, representatives of construction agencies, and 
specialists from (?the PTI Service) and (?Marlin Serin).

<F P=106> ["Memorandum: Symbol of Solidarity Between Lao and Chinese </F>
Armies"] 
  [Text] From 5 to 9 May this year, a high-level military 
delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] led by 
National Defense Minister Lieutenant General Choummali 
Sai-gnason paid an official visit to the PRC. The visit was 
aimed at further building and promoting the relations of 
friendship and strengthening, ever more fruitfully, the 
all-around solidarity between the two armies of Laos and China. 
Recalling Lao-Chinese history, we see that Laos and China have 
maintained relations with each other in many respects for a long 
time. The two countries share a common border and maintain 
similar customs. This is why the Chinese People's Liberation 
Army [CPLA] and the Lao People's Army [LPA] have maintained the 
traditional relations of friendship for a long time. Noteworthy 
is that during the period of the national salvation struggle 
against the imperialist aggressors, the Chinese army and people 
always stood by the side of the Lao army and people in carrying 
out the cause of struggle. In the visit to the PRC on this 
occasion, the high-level military delegation of the LPDR 
therefore intended to offer the CPLA pure friendship from the 
LPA to jointly develop and further enhance the relations and 
solidarity of fraternal friendship and comradeship. 
  During the four-day visit -- a very short visit, but in the 
spirit of close friendship -- the high-level military delegation 
of the LPDR was accorded a cordial welcome by the fraternal CPLA 
side. The LPA delegation was welcomed in an honorable manner at 
a solemn ceremony with the review of the guards of honor 
organized by General Chi Haotian, national defense minister of 
the PRC. The delegation was also accorded a warm welcome by 
cadres, combatants, and state employees of many army units it 
visited. The important thing, which served as a token of the 
promotion and enhancement of the relations of friendship, was 
the meeting between high-level military delegations of the two 
countries. In the meeting, which proceeded in an atmosphere of 
mutual understanding, the two sides reiterated in a 
straightforward manner their readiness to flourish the blooming 
solidarity and relations of fraternal friendship between the two 
armies. The high-level military delegation of the LPDR also had 
the honor to pay a courtesy call on General Liu Huaqing, member 
of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice chairman 
of the Central Military Committee, at the Government Guest Hall. 
On that occasion, Gen. Liu Huaqing expressed pleasure at 
welcoming the courtesy call of the LPA delegation. He also 
expressed satisfaction over the increasing enhancement of the 
relations of friendship between the parties, states, armies, and 
peoples of the two countries. It was a great honor for the LPDR 
delegation that Liu Huaqing, as a party leader, firmly 
reiterated the determination to vigorously encourage all parties 
concerned to do everything possible to strengthen the blooming 
friendship relations with Laos under the present favorable 
circumstances. On the occasion, Lt. Gen. Choummali Sai-gnason 
informed Gen. Liu Huaqing of the outcome of the delegation's 
visit. He also exchanged views with Gen. Liu Huaqing on many 
issues amid an atmosphere of good mutual understanding. 
  Following the visit to the PRC on this occasion, the 
high-level military delegation of the LPDR has profoundly 
understood the economic growth and development of the PRC as a 
result of the implementation of the open-door policy as 
maintained by the CPC. The delegation has been impressed with 
the welcome that was given, in a pure spirit of friendship, to 
the Lao side by the Chinese side during the visit. Every place 
the delegation visited, it was accorded a welcome in a sincere 
manner. The Chinese side also explained in an open manner 
useful lessons on educating, training, fostering, and managing 
soldiers, which have been carried out by the CPLA. The four-day 
period of the visit was therefore considered a dynamic period 
for the already progressing relations between the two armies of 
Laos and China. The high-level military delegation of the LPDR 
highly assessed the friendship relations and all-around 
cooperation between the two armies and expressed the conviction 
that these relations and cooperation will be increasingly 
developed and strengthened and will last forever.

  [Text] Japan has cited several Australian trade practices 
in its report on unfair trading policies. Tokyo correspondent, 
John (Shuverland), reports on the findings by the Ministry for 
International Trade and Industry [MITI]. 
  [Begin (Shuverland) recording] MITI says Australian 
Government's purchasing programs, which require companies 
tendering to buy Australian, are a problem area. According to 
MITI, the Australian Government is breaching the terms of the 
government procurement agreement reached as part of the GATT. 
  The Japanese Government says Australia has been a frequent 
user of antidumping measures and the reports says from a legal 
standpoint, the termination of injury to local industry has been 
questionable. It says the criteria for real estate investment 
is unclear and a barrier to development. MITI also cites 
Australian broadcasting laws restricting foreign commercials and 
direct investment. [end recording]

  [Text] Auckland, June 1 (AFP) -- Kiribati's acting head of 
state was forcibly moved from office by police Wednesday in what 
he slammed as an "administrative coup". 
  "Because we do not have an army here in Kiribati I cannot 
call it a military coup, but I can call it an administrative 
coup," Tekire Tameura, the now deposed chairman of the interim 
council of state, told AFP by telephone from the capital, Tarawa. 
  He said the acting police commissioner "dragged (me) from my 
chair". 
  It is the latest turn in a growing drama in the Micronesian 
state which earlier this week saw parliament dissolved and 
administration handed over to a council of state. 
  It took over within hours of the fall of the government of 
President Teatao Teannati on Monday. 
  In the 36-seat Maneaba-ni-Maungatabu, or assembly, the 
ruling 
National Progressive Party suffered a defeat, 21-19, when the 
opposition moved to set up a select committee to investigate 
misuse of public funds. 
  Tameura, who was also the head of the Public Service 
Commission (PSC), chaired the council along with Speaker 
Beretitara Neeti and Chief Justice Faqir Mohammed. 
  But then it was found Tamuera's public service position 
expired on May 28 and that technically he could not continue 
with the council. 
  He refused to stand down. 
  "Only the president can ask for my resignation," he said 
Wednesday. 
  There being no president, he could not be asked to resign. 
  However former cabinet secretary Ata Teaotai was named by 
the 
other two as a replacement on both the PSC and the council. 
  Tameura refused to accept the ruling and on Wednesday went 
to 
the PSC office. 
  While he was there the police showed up. 
  "I am now no longer chairman," he said. "On the orders of 
the chief justice I was dragged from my chair by the acting 
commissioner of police." 
  He was taken to a car, driven to his council office, allowed 
to collect personal items and then taken home. 
  Police had been placed at the council office to prevent his 
entry. 
  "Of course I am offended, I am taking legal advice." 
  He believed the action in removing him had nothing to do 
with 
his contract status but was "very political. 
  "People here know what it all means, but Kiribati is a very 
peaceful country and it is very quiet." 
  The country will go to the polls on July 21 (east of the 
international dateline) and July 22 (west of the dateline). 
July 29 has been set aside for second-round voting if results 
are not decisive. A month later, successful candidates will 
elect a president. 
  The next election is not due until mid-1995. 
  Details of the alleged corruption which bought down the 
government have not been made public yet, but relate to misuse 
in hotel accommodation, transport, entertainment and gifts. 
  Kiribati, the former British colony of the Gilbert Islands, 
consists of 33 islands totalling 811 square kilometres (324 sq. 
miles), whose 68,000 population, known as "I-Kiribati", are 
predominantly Micronesian. 
  Its capital atoll, Tarawa, was virtually flattened by the 
Americans when they landed marines their in 1943 to dislodge 
Japanese forces who had taken over most of the Gilberts. 
  The largest coral atoll in the world, Kiritimati or 
Christmas, was used for atmospheric nuclear testing by Britain 
and the US in the 1950s and 1960s. 
  The Maneaba-ni-Maungatabu includes a seat for Banaba or 
Ocean 
Island despite the fact that British phosphate mining all but 
destroyed it and the bulk of its people have been resettled in 
Fiji.

  [Text] Beijing, May 30 (YONHAP) -- Despite the current 
stalemate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), 
North Korea has reportedly said it would do its best to solve 
the problem through talks with the United States by guaranteeing 
the transparency of its nuclear program. 
  China's official XINHUA News Agency on Sunday quoted a North 
Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying Saturday [28 May] 
his country and the IAEA met May 25-27 to negotiate technical 
matters related to removing fuel rods from the 5-megawatt 
reactor at Yongbyon, revealing that Pyongyang would continue 
independent discharge of the spent fuel. 
  During the negotiations, North Korea reportedly proposed 
that 
under IAEA supervision it would independently replace and store 
the fuel rods, which would later be measured by the agency, 
after the preparation of a package deal between Washington and 
Pyongyang. 
  In response, the IAEA asked Pyongyang to submit the proposal 
in writing for further examination, the news agency said. 
  XINHUA quoted the Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying that 
Pyongyang was ready to continue the negotiations whenever the 
IAEA offers to meet, even though a final agreement was yet to be 
made between the two sides. 
  North Korea has been discharging nuclear fuel rods faster 
than expected, virtually blocking the IAEA's plan to take 
samples. The agency wishes to conduct direct tests of the 
discharged fuel rods to determine whether North Korea has 
diverted plutonium, the key element in manufacturing atomic 
bomb, for other purposes.

  [Text] The Bureau of Immigration and Deportation [BID] 
today cancelled the visas of 10 foreign nationals currently 
attending the Asia-Pacific Conference on East Timor [APCET]. 
Immigration Associate Commissioner Manuel Roxas reiterated that 
their action is in compliance with the government's position to 
bar foreigners attending the conference. Those foreigners who 
are now attending the APCET are believed to have gained entry 
into the country before their ban took effect. 
  In this connection, immigration agents headed by Tom 
Natividad this morning served summons on 10 foreigners attending 
the conference at the Malcolm Hall of the University of the 
Philippines. Natividad said the foreigners should personally go 
to the immigration office before 0800. He clarified that they 
went to Malcolm Hall just to serve the subpoenas to the 
foreigners and not to arrest them. 
  [Begin recording, in English] [Natividad] As I have said, we 
are just instructed to serve these to the secretariat, and 
that's all. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, if they do not appear, 
what 
will happen? 
  [Natividad] I don't know. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, what's your name again? 
  [Natividad] Tom Natividad. Intelligence Officer Tom 
Natividad. 
  [Indistinct question from unidentified correspondent] 
  [Natividad] No, it's not. (?It's) a subpoena that they have 
to appear at 0800 today. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Meidyatama Suryodiningrat] </F>
  [Text] Nusa Dua, Bali (JP) -- The second Senior Official 
Meeting (SOM) of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
began here yesterday with a call to narrow the economic gap 
between the developed and developing member nations. 
  "It is crucial for the developing economies in APEC to 
achieve a rate of development that will allow them to reduce the 
gap between themselves and their high industrialized partners," 
Director General for Foreign Economic Relations Wisber Luis said 
at the opening the three-day meeting. 
  Wisber said that for this reason, it is important the four 
fields of cooperation in the APEC framework -- human resources 
development, promotion of small and medium scale industries, 
private sector participation an improvement of infrastructures 
-- should be prioritized. 
  The meeting is the second of four SOMs to held in 
preparation 
for the sixth APEC Ministerial Meeting due to be held in Jakarta 
in November. 
  Over 250 officials from the 17-member states are attending 
the meeting at the Bali International Convention Center at Nusa 
Dua's complex of luxury hotels. 
  APEC, currently presided over by Indonesia, is comprised of 
Canada, the United States, Mexico, Japan, Taiwan, China, Hong 
Kong South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, 
Singapore, lndonesia, Brunei, Papua New Guinea, Australia and 
New Zealand. 
  Wisber explained that, as chairman, Indonesia hopes the 
current SOM will try to broaden and intensify the four fields of 
cooperation. He said the recently signed Uruguay Round of 
multilateral trade negotiations in Marrakech, Morocco, will have 
a positive impact on APEC. 
  "The newly concluded Round may provide a fresh impetus for 
APEC member to work towards a more liberalized trade and 
investment regime in the region," he said. 
  Talking to reporters following the first session of 
yesterday's meeting, Wisber said many of the delegates were 
delighted that Bali was chosen as the venue of the SOM. 
  "They have commended Indonesia for the selection of the 
site," he said. "Of course I didn't tell them that it added 
costs," he added modestly. 
  Wisber would not reveal much about the contents of the 
first-day's meeting but said that the provisional agenda for the 
SOM had been approved. He added that participants were 
reviewing the reports of the various working groups and 
committees which had meetings a week In advance. 
  At the conclusion of yesterday's events, several delegates 
explained that much of the proceedings dealt with the works of 
the Committee on Trade and Investment (CTI). 
  Among the most important items discussed was the adoption of 
an APEC Investment Principal, which included such issues as 
non-discrimination and free movement of assets. 
  With the United States and Australia as the main initiators, 
it was agreed that the latter would be responsible for producing 
a draft of the Investment Principals. 
  Another topic on the agenda was the issue of promotion of 
small and medium scale enterprises. Apparently no concrete 
results have been yielded except for the fact that Taiwan will 
be responsible for drawing-up a draft proposal. 
  Among the issues to be discussed in today's meeting will be 
the creation of a Pacific Business Forum which will be an 
assembly of business persons throughout the Asia Pacific region. 
  The delegates have also proposed that two persons represent 
each country in the first meeting of the business forum 
scheduled to be held in Singapore from June 10 to June 11. 
  At this point, Indonesia and Japan have already announced 
their representatives. Indonesia will be represented by eminent 
businessman A.R. Ramli and a former minister of cooperatives, 
Bustanil Arifin. Japan has selected the president and vice 
president of Itochu their representatives -- Minoru Morohushi 
and Nobuo Tateishi, respectively.

  [Text] Nusa Dua, Bali (JP) -- Senior officials of the Asia 
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum have agreed to 
recommend improved cooperation on infrastructural development 
and on the nurturing of smaller-scale businesses. 
  At the close of the second three-day APEC senior officials 
meeting (SOM) on Friday, delegates expressed the need to deal 
with the region's growing infrastructure demands. 
  Saodah Syahruddin, director for economic relations among 
developing countries at the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, said APEC's member economies have responded positively 
to Indonesia's proposal to focus on infrastructure as a central 
area for cooperation. 
  APEC groups the United States, Mexico, Japan Taiwan, Hong 
Kong, China, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, the 
Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Canada, Brunei 
Australia and New Zealand. 
  "The senior officials agreed to discuss cooperation on 
infrastructures at their next meeting," Saodah explained. 
  Indonesia, as chairman of APEC, has identified developing 
human resources small and medium-scale enterprises, private 
sector participation and improvement of infrastructures as key 
areas of concentration. 
  During lunch after the closing of the SOM, Saodah explained 
that the region, which represents 40 percent of the world's 
population, will require about US$1 trillion in infrastructure 
investment by the year 2010. 
  The Indonesian Government has also anticipated this need by 
assigning the Ministries of Transportation, Mines and Energy, 
Public Works and Tourism, Post and Telecommunications to deal 
with the challenges. 
  Speaking on small and medium enterprises, Saodah said the 
definitions of "small" and "medium" have yet to be made. 
  "Some would say that a small business is run by 10 people 
and 
others say 100 people," she said. "We are still trying to work 
it out." 
  During the SOM, delegates reviewed the results of last 
month's meeting in Jakarta of APEC's Expert Group on Small and 
Medium Enterprises and endorsed it as an initial program which 
will be further discussed at the group's next meeting in 
Yogyakarta in September. 
  Johan Syahperi Saleh, the chief of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs' bureau for economic affairs of the ASEAN National 
Secretariat said the problems of small and medium enterprises 
are related to access to markets and financing facilities, 
limitations in management abilities and technology and limited 
access to information. 
  "We need policies that are conducive to overcoming these 
obstacles," he said. 
  The SOM also agreed that the expert group should begin to 
study strategies for promoting financing for small and medium 
enterprises. 
  The SOM also set tentative dates for the upcoming events. 
The third SOM will be held in Yogyakarta on September 10-14 and 
the fourth in Jakarta on November 6-10. 
  The APEC Ministerial Meeting will be held in Jakarta one day 
after the fourth SOM on November 11-12 and prior to the APEC 
Economic Leaders Meeting to be held at the Presidential Palace 
in Bogor, West Java, on November 15. 
  The senior officials also agreed to invite Chile, APEC's 
newest member, to take part in their next meeting. 
  The SOM, however, failed to reach a consensus on requests by 
non-member economies to participate in the meetings of APEC's 
working groups. Countries such as Vietnam have recently 
conveyed to President Suharto their wish to take part in these 
discussions.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur -- Defense Secretary Renato de Villa 
urged opposing sides in the Korean peninsula to exercise 
restraint, and called for a moratorium on potentially 
destabilizing activities such as fresh arms and troops buildup 
and deployment in the South China Sea. He also called on the 
Pacific Basin Economic Council to help stabilize security 
concerns in the Asia-Pacific region by creating economic 
activity. 
  He was speaking during a defense and security session of the 
27th Pacific Basin Economic Council [PBEC] meeting yesterday 
afternoon. The PBEC, he said, could help alleviate the situation 
in the Peninsula and help North Korea to "enter the mainstream 
of the Pacific Basin community" by inviting the North to 
participate in PBEC activities. Prospects of greater trade 
opportunities and investments can "provide some incentives for 
North Korea to respond positively to any PBEC initiative in that 
direction." 
  Mr. de Villa also suggested that the PBEC develop a vital 
role in the economic pursuits in the South China Sea where there 
is a need for continuing dialogues on the demilitarization of 
the area. Maintenance of the status quo is necessary "with 
respect to the claims of sovereignty and exploration of possible 
modes of cooperation in scientific research, inventory, 
exploitation and development of its resources with the 
participation of the claimant countries," he added. 
  Corporate involvement in enhancing the security and 
stability 
of the region is vital, said Secretary de Villa. Although the 
Asia- Pacific region has managed to adapt "rather well" to the 
changes in the international community with the end of the Cold 
War, it still faces problems of "incalculable impact on peaceful 
endeavors amidst the optimism in the economic progress of the 
region."

  [Text] Singapore, May 28 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Navigational 
safety and pollution-control mechanisms in the Straits of 
Malacca need to be updated to keep pace with development. 
  This was one of the recommendations made by Southeast Asian 
coastal and sea management experts at a three-day conference on 
sustainable development of coastal and ocean areas in Southeast 
Asia which ended Saturday. 
  It was organised by the Southeast Asian Programme in ocean 
law, policy and management (SEAPOL). 
  The experts believe that while the mechanisms were still 
relevant, its elements -- some of which were 20 years old -- 
could be improved as more vessels were using the straits and new 
coastal development projects came up. 
  The basic principles for safety of navigation and 
consequently prevention of pollution that we have laid out 
remain solid but the problem is whether we have been left behind 
by development, said Indonesia's ambassador at-large Professor 
Hashim Jalal. 
  International Maritime Organisation (IMO) programme manager 
Dr. Chua Thia-Eng said a long-term financing mechanism to combat 
marine pollution was necessary and oil spill contigency plans 
strengthened at the regional and national levels. 
  But, he said, the problem of marine pollution could not be 
resolved by governments alone as it required public support such 
as in reducing waste disposal into the sea. 
  Department of Geography Associate Professor Dr. Chia Lin 
Sien 
of the National University of Singapore said the the element of 
human error as a cause of accidents at sea should be given 
serious attention in view of the increasing traffic in the 
straits. 
  People manning the ships have to be properly trained and the 
vessels in good condition, he added. 
  Conference joint-chairman Professor Tommy Koh agreed that a 
problem faced globally was in the training of seamen and this 
had led to crews being below par. 
  Another problem was an aging fleet with few new ships being 
commissioned and those in service unseaworthy, said Professor 
Koh, who is director of Singapore's Institute of Policy Studies.

  [Text] It is likely that objective criteria, which are a 
focal point at issue in the Japanese-U.S. economic framework 
talks, will continue to have the characteristic of "numerical 
targets." The framework talks have been resumed on the 
condition that objective criteria will not become numerical 
targets. However, a government source said: "There is an 
interpretational gap between Japan and the United States over 
the numerical targets, but they 'started acting before obtaining 
full consensus' and resumed talks without completely closing the 
gap." The United States believes that unlike the case of 
"quantities of imported goods," a pledge to increase in the 
future "the number of dealers who sell foreign products," for 
example, will not be regarded as a numerical target. This U.S. 
view differs from Japan's official explanation that it will "set 
no future goals." But because Japan has already made 
compromises by setting goals designed to allow more foreign 
companies to make inroads into the Japanese market in each 
sector and to increase sales of foreign products, it is expected 
that Japan will eventually meet the United States halfway 
regarding the objective criteria as well. 
  At the framework talks, agreement was reached to introduce 
objective criteria to measure the openness of Japan's markets. 
However, opinions of the United States, which calls for the 
incorporation of future goals into objective criteria, and 
Japan, which wants to use these criteria only as a means to 
evaluate the openness of its markets in the past, were divided. 
The talks have been suspended since February. 
  Prior to resuming the talks, the two nations exchanged on 23 
May a statement of agreement, which was not made public. As for 
objective criteria to measure the openness of Japan's markets, 
both nations only confirmed the following principles: 1) 
Objective criteria will not become numerical targets; 2) Several 
yardsticks, including quantitative and qualitative standards, 
will be set; and 3) The openness of Japan's markets will be 
evaluated comprehensively not by a single standard but rather by 
several standards. A detailed definition of numerical targets 
is not mentioned in this agreement at all. 
  A Japanese negotiator said that the U.S. Government is 
interpreting the numerical targets as future goals regarding the 
quantities of imported foreign goods and foreign companies' 
market share in Japan. For instance, the United States believes 
that the goal of "increasing imports of foreign automobiles by a 
certain percentage before a certain fiscal year" is a numerical 
target and that it has no intention to ask Japan to make such a 
pledge. In this regard, both countries share the same view. 
  According to the same source, however, the United States 
also 
believes that pledges will not be considered to be numerical 
targets as long as they set quantitative criteria for the 
improvement of Japan's domestic environment for increasing the 
share of foreign products. A public commitment to "increase the 
number of foreign car dealers by a certain percentage before a 
certain fiscal year" will not be considered to be a numerical 
target. During his speech, U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) 
Micky Kantor expressed a similar opinion. 
  Some government officials point out that Japan agreed to set 
rules to evaluate market liberalization by applying several 
standards on the basis of the presumption that an indicator 
similar to numerical targets would be incorporated into 
objective criteria. They expect that comprehensive evaluations 
by applying several standards will have the effect of preventing 
the United States from imposing sanctions on Japan even if Japan 
fails to reach part of the target figures.

  [Text] The government has decided on its approach at the 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks negotiations on government 
procurement reopening in Tokyo on 3 June. With regard to the 
creteria for regular monitoring of the openness of the market 
(objective criteria), it plans to propose using the share of 
foreign products in past government procurement as a 
quantitative criterion, and progress in the implementation of 
measures to improve procurement procedures announced last March 
as a qualitative criterion. However, the United States is 
expected to reiterate its desire to discuss procurement by the 
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT). It may again 
demand that a certain measure of numerical targets be included 
in the objective criteria. 
  Government procurement is one of the three priority sectors 
in the framework talks. The focal issue here is how to increase 
the ratio of foreign products in telecommunications and medical 
equipment purchased by Japanese Government agencies. With 
regard to the issue of objective criteria, the following points 
have been agreed upon during the recent discussions between 
Japan and the United States which led to the resumption of the 
framework talks: 1) these criteria will not be considered 
numerical targets; 2) both quantitative and qualitative criteria 
will be created; and 3) a comprehensive evaluation of the 
openness of the market should be conducted by using a number of 
criteria. In line with the above, the Japanese Government has 
finalized its concrete proposals on objective criteria in this 
sector. 
  In government procurement, the ratio of foreign products in 
telecommunications equipment (in 1992) was around 6 percent 
(according to a Japanese Government survey). The government 
plans to monitor this ratio regularly to demonstrate its 
positive attitude toward expanding procurement of products made 
in the United States and other countries. Japan also plans to 
include the number of foreign companies participating in bids as 
one objective criterion. This data will be a measure of how 
actively U.S. companies sell their products. A regular check on 
this figure will contribute to encourage U.S. efforts to 
participate in the market. 
  The measures to reform bidding procedures announced in March 
consist mainly of steps to better reflect the foreign companies' 
opinions. By looking at how faithfully such measures have been 
implemented, Japan hopes to eliminate "suspicions about the 
existence of dango [bid rigging]" among some U.S. companies. 
  With regard to NTT, Japan argues that "This company has been 
privatized. It is not logical to discuss NTT procurement at the 
framework talks." 
  In relation to objective criteria, the United States will 
probably ask for mid- and long-term commitments to sustain the 
current trend of increasing foreign share in government 
procurement, claiming this does not constitute a numerical 
target. Japan intends to reject this demand, in the belief that 
"any commitment for the future should be interpreted as a 
numerical target." 
  Since government procurement is an area under direct 
government control, it has been considered a sector where it 
would be easier to reach an agreement. The Japanese Government 
has also been hoping to bring progress to the framework talks as 
a whole by achieving an agreement in procurement. However, if 
conflicts arise un the NTT issue, negotiations may not proceed 
smoothly along the line of this scenario.

<F P=106> [By economic reporter Yoichi Takita] </F>
  [Text] The agreement to resume Japan-U.S. trade talks 
appears to have brought a "temporary halt" to the unilateral 
decline of the dollar. The reason is that coordinated buying of 
the dollar and coordination on interest policy by Japan, the 
United States, and Europe has been followed by a rapprochement 
on resumption of the Japan-U.S.trade talks. Doubt about the 
recycling of capital into the United States with its 
international balance-of-payments deficit has caused turmoil in 
the securities markets and authorities have assumed a 
coordinated position. The strong yen outlook is now subject to 
slight relaxation until the Naples summit in July and should 
have a favorable impact on Japanese stock prices. 
  The breakdown in the Japan-U.S. trade talks after the 
Japan-U.S. summit in February triggered the rapid rise in the 
yen. In that sense, the decision to resume the talks should 
serve as reason for a cheaper yen. The yen underwent only slight 
fluctuations around 104 yen to the dollar in trading on the 
Tokyo market on 24 May as the trading had already reflected the 
pending Japan-U.S. compromise. 
  The strong yen coupled with fear about incipient inflation 
functioned like a boomerang in triggering a loss of confidence 
in the dollar and a widespread decline in the dollar amidst 
rising U.S. interest rates. Shigetada Nakajima, chief economist 
of the foreign exchange-securities department of Itohchu, 
comments, "It was a case where the United States had no choice 
but to recognize that use of foreign exchange rates to draw 
concessions from Japan was inadvisable." The change in the 
posture of U.S. authorities has deprived the markets of an 
excuse to go on a major dollar-selling offensive. 
  Whenever the United States moves to cause a strong yen with 
the aim of correcting the trade imbalance, some temporary 
successes are realized, but a gradual widespread decline in the 
dollar follows, which imposes the inevitable need to shift to 
dollar-defense actions such as monetary tightening. Actions to 
cause a strong yen by the Carter administration, which was 
inaugurated in 1977, and the 1985 Plaza Accord for a weaker 
dollar are actions that are being repeated by the Clinton 
administration. 
  The skepticism of the U.S. bond and stock markets after the 
United States shifted to monetary tightening policies in 
February 1994 testify to the tenacity of fears originating in 
such a chain of events. Whether it is Japan's recurring 
balance-of-payments surplus or the U.S. balance-of-payments 
deficit, imbalances for either nation can become the focus of 
attention. The sense of an overheating U.S. economy has 
ironically focused market attention on the expansion of the U.S. 
balance-of-payments deficit. 
  Normally, the favorable U.S. economy in comparison to Japan 
and Europe and the higher U.S. interest rates would be favorable 
for buying dollars, but investors have failed to react favorably. 
  Investors do not react favorably is that they assume that an 
excess of dollars will persist as long as the U.S. 
balance-of-payments deficit continues to expand and that the 
supply and demand balance will eventually result in a cheaper 
dollar. Officials at major investment firms admit, "Ever since 
the strong yen trend began in the 1990's, we have not succeeded 
in making a profit on U.S. Government bonds." 
  Even if the series of U.S. Government policy changes have 
quieted the turbulence in the markets, the existence of 
imbalances in payments between Japan and the United States will 
cause hesitancy in investing in dollar assets. Market 
participants have reached the analytical assessment that "a 
dearth of news affecting the markets until the Naples summit 
will limit movements in the yen's value." However, any delay in 
mollifying concerns about an overheated U.S. economy could 
result in the potential for an explosive upward movement in the 
yen which will call for full-scale dollar defense actions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Shoichito Toyoda, chairman of the Federation </F>
of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), by unidentified MAINICHI 
SHIMBUN reporter; place, date not given] 
  [Text] [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] As the new Keidanren chairman, 
and a representative of the auto industry, what plans do you 
have to break the deadlock over Japan-U.S. relations? 
  [Toyoda] As a matter of fact, automobiles represent a very 
large part of Japan's trade surplus. But, as Keidanren 
chairman, I should not serve only the auto industry. It is 
important in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks to 
adequately implement macro economic policies. As each 
industrial sector is appropriately working on negotiation in its 
field, I want Keidanren to deal with macro economic issues. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What is your attitude toward political 
donations and relations between politicians and the business 
sector? 
  [Toyoda] The previous leadership of Keidanren decided not to 
engage in political donations, and I will follow that policy. 
Japan's politics is currently undergoing great changes, and we 
would like to watch developments. Offering donations is not the 
only way Keidanren can deal with politicians. As Japanese 
society changes, donations to defend liberalism are losing their 
significance. I hope politicians make elections less expensive 
hereafter. Keidanren intends to launch a special committee on 
business-politics relations, and to study foreign companies' 
attitudes toward politics. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What, then, is your attitude toward 
bureaucrats? 
  [Toyoda] Administrative reform is one of the most urgent 
issues for Japan. Bureaucrats are supposed to take the 
initiative in the reform process as they are fully aware of the 
need for reform. They are capable of carrying out reform, and 
they are well aware of the need for it. Deregulation must be 
promoted, and it is absolutely necessary to provide the watchdog 
body proposed by the so-called Hiraiwa Council. No matter who 
takes over the government, this policy should remain unchanged. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Japan has lost the knack of constant 
economic growth. As Keidanren chairman, what is your management 
strategy? 
  [Toyoda] All companies have to keep maturing, and so does a 
nation. The bubble-economy boom should not be revived, but we 
must seek ways to improve society. If we stop, we will fall 
behind international competitors. Although Japan is going to 
have an aged society, it should not lose its vitality. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Officials of Keidanren are often called 
"private bureaucrats" for their high-handed attitudes. What are 
you going to do to reform Keidanren itself? 
  [Toyoda] Society is changing, and Keidanren must try harder 
to catch up with social trends. We have to think about 
organizational reform, and our officials should be modestly 
capable people.

<F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 2 June Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] As the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
has practically issued an ultimatum on the inspection of nuclear 
fuel rods in relation to the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected 
development of nuclear devices, the government says: "We will 
reach a conclusion in the next few days." 
  According to a top government official Japan is closely 
watching moves by both North Korea and the United States. 
  The government's basic understanding is that the DPRK does 
not recognize IAEA as a viable negotiating partner, and it wants 
to break the deadlock through negotiations with the United 
States. 
  At the House of Representatives Budget Committee on 1 June, 
Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said: "North Korea wants to give 
priority to talks with the United States. It is not responding 
to Japan's persuasion." 
  He said that although Japan has been talking with the DPRK 
unofficially through its embassy in Beijing and its UN mission, 
such efforts had been unsuccessful. 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata told the committee: "We are 
seriously concerned. We hope to somehow win [the DPRK's] 
understanding through dialogue." 
  He stressed Japan's position of approaching this issue 
through dialogue. 
  Kakizawa also said: "If the nuclear issue is resolved, we 
would like to go into negotiations to normalize diplomatic 
relations." 
  The normalization of ties would include economic assistance 
to the DPRK. 
  Kakizawa also talked about measures relating to possible UN 
sanctions, and indicated that the government was considering 
signing an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement (ACSA) to 
enable offering refuelling and other services to U.S. Forces. 
  Apparently, while the government's basic position is to 
promote dialogue, but it is also dealing with the possibility of 
sanctions, adopting a carrot-and-stick strategy.

  [Text] In connection with the DPRK's (North Korea) 
suspected development of nuclear devices, the Japanese 
Government is again distressed by the deadlock in negotiations 
between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) on the replacement of nuclear fuel rods at the Yongbyon 
experimental nuclear reactor, because it has been counting on a 
better atmosphere for dialogue after the third round of 
high-level talks between the United States and North Korea was 
scheduled to be held in June. 
  Under the circumstances, Japan will have to continue to take 
a two-pronged stand for some time by "closely watching future 
developments while studying various necessary measures to 
prepare for a contingency" (according to a top Foreign Ministry 
official). 
  In the past few days, senior Foreign Ministry officials have 
been emphasizing the "dominant trend of dialogue" to leaders of 
the ruling and opposition parties, saying: "Things are moving 
toward a solution right now. There should be no 
misunderstanding concerning this." The ministry is concerned 
that if "frightening discussions" on questions such as sanctions 
or legislation to deal with an emergency come to the fore, this 
may provoke not only the DPRK but also the ROK and the United 
States. 
  The working-level meeting between Japan, the United States, 
and South Korea in New York on 24 May which agreed on continuing 
the policy of dialogue and coordination between the three 
nations if sanctions are imposed on the DPRK was a cooperative 
gesture in line with the U.S. policy of continuing the dialogue. 
  However, after the North Korea-IAEA talks broke down, a 
pessimistic view is again gaining ground inside the government. 
Some say: "We have been betrayed by North Korea so many times. 
This time, although we have not been optimistic, we were hoping 
for at least some progress" (according to a Foreign Ministry 
source). 
  Some government officials now take the view that the 
high-level talks between the United States and North Korea will 
inevitably have to be postponed. Even in the United States, the 
prevailing view is now in favor of sanctions, claiming, "If 
U.S.-North Korean talks are held without verifying the existence 
of nuclear arms in the DPRK, this will just be falling into the 
North Korean trap." 
  If no improvement is seen in this situation, UN economic 
sanctions will inevitably become the focal issue. The Japanese 
Government may also be forced to make a major decision. 
  Even if the third round of high-level U.S.-DPRK talks are 
held as scheduled, it is entirely possible that North Korea will 
continue to play the nuclear card in the future. It is believed 
that "sooner or later, there will have to be a solution to the 
basic issue of whether inspections will be permitted at two 
facilities, which were not opened to IAEA and are highly 
suspected of holding nuclear devices," according to a Foreign 
Ministry source. Days of anxiety are expected to continue for 
the Japanese Government.

  [Text] At a House of Representatives' Budget Committee 
meeting on 30 May, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was asked about 
the collapse of talks between the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) and Pyongyang over the inspection of fuel rods 
being removed from a nuclear reactor in the DPRK. Hata said: 
"I have repeatedly asked the United States and South Korea to 
tenaciously talk with Pyongyang. On the other hand, I have 
asked North Korea to consider the anxiety in the international 
community." He then stressed that he intended to work with 
concerned nations to resolve the nuclear issue through talks 
with Pyongyang. 
  Hata also said: "I have told Pyongyang (if the country 
agrees to settle the issue through talks) Japan will help 
improve the DPRK's living standards together with the United 
States, South Korea, and China." In this way, he indicated that 
North Korea would be offered multinational support and 
cooperation if it agreed to resolve the issue through dialogue. 
  Hata was answering questions from Yoshio Hachiro (a member 
of 
the Social Democratic Party of Japan). 
  Concerning the fuel rod removal Pyongyang has arbitrarily 
carried out, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa also said: "If the 
situation remains as it is now, it will become difficult in the 
next few days to confirm the fuel rod exchange," indicating the 
nuclear problem would reach the crucial point in the next few 
days.

Representatives Budget Committee, Yoshimi Mino of the opposition 
Social Democratic Party of Japan indicated, "North Korea has a 
feeling that the UN Security Council and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are under the control of the United 
States," and he then asked, "Does the DPRK not aim to negotiate 
with the United States for a normalization of relations between 
the two countries?" Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa replied, 
"The DPRK appears to be intending to settle the issue of the 
replacement of fuel rods at the experimental nuclear reactor in 
North Korea through talks with the United States." The foreign 
minister also stated, "I consider what Mr. Mino just indicated 
to be our view."

  [Text] Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said on 1 June that 
when U.S. Forces enforce a sea blockade against the DPRK (North 
Korea) over the issue of its nuclear weapons development: 
"Generally speaking, Japan will offer possible cooperation 
within the constitutional limitation." 
  He was also asked the government's attitude toward the U.S. 
proposal for an "acquisition and cross-servicing agreement 
(ACSA)," an accord aimed at the mutual provision of military 
supplies and services between Japan and the United States. 
  He said the government was studying possibility of enacting 
such an agreement, saying: "To design the framework of the 
concept, the government is studying various aspects, including 
the need for the ACSA." 
  Kakizawa made his remarks in reply to questions by 
Representative Taro Nakayama of the Liberal Democratic Party 
during the 1 June session of the lower house budget committee. 
  Director General Atsushi Kanda of the Defense Agency said 
that as far as North Korea's preparations for the test launching 
of new-type missiles are concerned: "We are watching 
developments with great concern."

  [Text] Commenting on North Korea's plans to test-fire a 
missile, a government source said on 31 May that the DPRK will 
test- fire the missile on 7 May at the earliest. The Defense 
Agency [DA], which has placed itself on alert, is trying to 
collect information. 
  The United States has provided the DA with information 
compiled on the basis of photographs taken by U.S. 
reconnaissance satellites. According to that data, trucks loaded 
with fuel and cranes are assembling at a launch site in 
northeastern North Korea, and the missile's test-launching 
process is under way. The DPRK was expected to test-fire the 
missile in early June, but the prevailing view is that North 
Korea will test-fire it on 7 June because of information 
indicating that North Korea needs a few more days to make final 
preparations for the launch. 
  The missile to be test-fired is believed to be the Nodong-1, 
which has a range of 1,000 km and which was test-fired last May. 
  The DA has put Maritime Self-Defense Force P3-C 
antisubmarine 
aircraft on a state of alert to ready them for patrols over the 
Sea of Japan. The Air Defense-Self Force also has placed YS-11E 
electronics reconnaissance aircraft and E2-C airborne warning 
and control aircraft on standby status. In this way, DA is 
making preparations to collect a variety of information on North 
Korea's test-firing of the missile.

  [Text] Commenting on North Korea's moves to test-fire a 
missile at a news conference on 30 May, Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Hiroshi Kumagai said, "The government has information on those 
moves in that country." In this way, the Japanese Government 
officially confirmed for the first time North Korea's moves to 
test-fire the missile. 
  At the news conference, however, Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Kumagai stated: "The government does not know details of North 
Korea's plans to test-fire the missile. The government also does 
not know whether North Korea's moves to test-fire the missile 
are related to the issue of international inspections of its 
nuclear facilities. I, therefore, would like to refrain from 
making any further comment at the present stage."

  [Text] At a news conference on 31 May, Defense Agency [DA] 
Director General Atsushi Kanda commented on North Korea's 
preparations for experimental missile launching, saying that "it 
does not mean that live shells will be flying around." At the 
same time, he also said: "We are making appropriate 
preparations to face outcome of the experiment." In this way, 
he suggested that the government, from the viewpoint of Japan's 
security, is ready to strictly deal with the situation if North 
Korea carries out the experimental launching. 
  What the Defense Agency is strongly concerned about is the 
type of missile North Korea is preparing to launch. A 
government source points out that "there is a strong possibility 
that North Korea may deploy missiles, which can reach Japan, for 
actual warfare" if a missile, which will be used in the 
experimental launching, is "Nodong-1" medium-range missile, 
which is capable of flying 1,000 km and was launched in May last 
year, or another type with longer flying capability. Defense 
officials are increasingly worried that depending on outcome of 
the experiment, Japanese security may face a dangerous situation.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Confusion of Emergency Bill With Measures </F>
To Deal With Economic Sanctions Against North Korea"] 
  [Text] The issue of North Korea's suspected development of 
nuclear weapons has now entered a new phase now North Korea has 
begun removing fuel rods at an experimental nuclear reactor. 
The issue has obvious security implications for Japan, and so 
debates have been held in the Diet. But the debates have tended 
to boil down to an exchange of words on the relationship between 
universal and collective security. They have failed to focus on 
how Japan should ensure its security under the current 
international situation. 
  There has been Diet dispute over interpretation of the 
Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. It has been labelled as theological 
dispute, and the point of issue was the relationship between 
Japan's constitution and the defensive action this permitted the 
country to take. The dispute had the effect of putting the 
brakes on Japan's buildup of military strength. But the 
political parties used the security issue ideologically because, 
in the Cold War era, their relationship with the United States 
and the Soviet Union was the main factor in determining their 
status at home. 
  Even now, the Cold War's influence still lingers in Japan 
and 
parliamentary debates on Japanese security are still immature. 
  Debate has been held in the Diet on whether the collective 
security laid down in the UN Charter and the universal security 
that is the "global framework for the maintenance of peace and 
safety through the United Nations" are different. How meaningful 
is this to Japan's security? 
  If the government and the Diet take a common-sense view of 
Japan's security, they must first discuss the North Korean 
situation. They can discuss North Korea's domestic situation, 
how bilateral U.S.-North Korea talks are expected to go, and 
what Japan can do to help find a diplomatic solution to the 
issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons. 
There are a lot of topics to be discussed. 
  The main point of concern here is that while government 
ministries and agencies are informally examining ways to deal 
with the situation should economic sanctions unfortunately be 
imposed against North Korea and Japan be obliged to follow, the 
Diet has not yet debate the matter. 
  Perhaps the government thinks it would lessen potential 
political friction to submit to the Diet a package of amendment 
bills and get them passed at a stroke shortly after the economic 
sanctions introduced. 
  If the government does think that way, it is ignoring the 
Diet. The Diet is the supreme body of state power that is 
mandated to make a final decision on how the government deals 
with emergencies when they occur. Bureaucrats should not be 
allowed to deal with the emergency on the basis of their own 
judgment. The Diet has delayed holding the debates out of fear 
they may incite North Korea or because it was judged 
incompatible with Japan's national interests to publicize the 
country's measures for dealing with the emergency by debating 
them in parliament. The Diet has also not held the debates 
because the government has not supplied it with the information 
needed by the Diet to provide informed debate. 
  It is true that government ministries and agencies are 
informally "studying" ways to amend relevant laws so that Japan 
can put economic sanctions into effect. The Diet, nonetheless, 
should hold the debates despite the aforementioned restraints. 
Lack of debate is causing a chaos. 
  And one cause of the chaos is the confusion over the 
legislation for an emergency that was studied by the Fukuda 
cabinet in 1977. This legislation was in anticipation of a 
situation in which Japan goes to war, and is different from the 
legal measures that may be needed to deal with the North Korean 
situation. 
  The confusion has arisen because debate on Japan's security 
in the Diet has boiled down to a play of words. In particular, 
the government must explain the present situation in a way the 
people can easily understand. It is impossible for the 
government to promote any policy unless it is understood by the 
people.

  [Text] Secretary-General Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] attended a symposium sponsored by the party's 
Tokyo Metropolitan Chapter in Tokyo on 28 May. Touching on the 
issue of the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected nuclear arms 
development, Ozawa said: "In Japan, no regulations on crisis 
management in an emergency are stipulated in any laws, including 
the constitution. If something unexpected should take place, 
administrative work will completely fail to function." Thus, he 
stressed his idea that the government should improve its crisis 
management system legally by taking such measures as legislation 
of an emergency bill. 
  Citing as an allegory, Ozawa pointed out: "Suppose all the 
cabinet members were killed by bombs dropped on the prime 
minister's official residence during a cabinet meeting, the 
succeeding prime minister could only be elected if the Diet was 
in session. However, there are no regulations whatsoever as to 
what should be done if the Diet was in recess." Then, he added: 
"An emergency could possibly arise even in a natural disaster."

  [Text] Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP], gave a news conference on the morning of 
29 May in Sapporo city, in which he discussed the possibility of 
dissolving the Diet, and calling for general elections 
immediately after the passage of the fiscal 1994 budget. He 
said, "The ruling parties believe that holding elections under 
the multiseat constituencies system means a sabotage of 
political reform. This is aimed at creating confusion inside 
the LDP and the Social Democratic Party of Japan. It is 
possible for all party heads to gather and decide on certain 
necessary measures." This indicated that Mori believes that if 
all parties agree to introduce the "heiritsu" system of 
combining single-seat constituencies and proportional 
representation in the election after the next one, it is also 
possible to hold the next election under the multiseat system.

  [Text] Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and party chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama held a joint news conference on the afternoon of 29 May 
following a meeting of the SDPJ Central Committee. During the 
news conference, Mr. Kubo made it clear the SDPJ was willing to 
consult Prime Minister Hata in advance about the framework of 
the next coalition government and the conditions for the SDPJ's 
participation if the Hata cabinet voluntarily resigned en masse 
in response to the SDPJ's demand. 
  At the news conference, Mr. Kubo said: "The possibility 
cannot be ruled out that Prime Minister Hata will become prime 
minister of the third coalition government." 
  He added: "I believe that if the Hata cabinet resigns en 
masse, it will be possible for the SDPJ to discuss with Prime 
Minister Hata in advance on the formation of the next coalition 
government. If the 1994 budget bill is passed in the House of 
Representatives, prospects would be opened for forming the next 
coalition government toward the end of the current Diet ordinary 
session." 
  In this way, Mr. Kubo indicated that, depending on Prime 
Minister Hata's handling of the general resignation of his 
cabinet, the SDPJ would begin talks with him about the formation 
of the next coalition government shortly after the passage of 
the 1994 budget bill in the House of Representatives. 
  The SDPJ has criticized Ichiro Ozawa, representative 
secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] for the influence 
he wields on the coalition government. 
  At the news conference, a reporter referred to the 
relationship between the SDPJ and the next coalition government 
and then asked Mr. Kubo: "Will Mr. Ozawa's resignation as 
representative secretary of Shinseito be a condition of SDPJ 
joining the next coalition government?" 
  Kubo said: "I have no intention of speaking ill of an 
executive of another party. I will, however, speak of the 
decision-making process of the ruling coalition parties if I 
have to do so."

<F P=106> [Interview with Masuo Matsuoka, secretary general of the </F>
ruling Japan New Party, by unidentified SANKEI SHIMBUN reporter 
on 27 May -- place not given] 
  [Text] In an interview with a SANKEI SHIMBUN reporter on 
27 May, Masuo Matsuoka, secretary general of the ruling Japan 
New Party [JNP], indicated that the JNP will work for a return 
of the opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to the 
ruling coalition. The following is a summary of the interview: 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Four more legislators have quit the JPN. 
What is your opinion? 
  Matsuoka: The JNP by nature is a political group formed by 
Mr. Morihiro Hosokawa, who has a strong sense of mission and 
people with differing political beliefs. It has been difficult 
to keep the JPN together. The JNP has played the role of 
coordinator between Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and the 
Komeito [Clean Government Party], and the SDPJ when they have 
discussed policies. Those legislators who have broken away from 
our party advocated that the JNP must forge an alliance with the 
SDPJ and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] and cut off its 
alliance with Shinseito and the Komeito. I believe it would have 
been better if they had remained in our party and played a 
pivotal role in realigning the established political parties 
instead of quitting our party. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Those breakaway legislators bitterly 
complained that Mr. Hosokawa and the JPN leadership were 
excessively dependent on Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of 
Shinseito, and Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary of the Komeito. What 
do you think? 
  Matsuoka: Mr. Hosokawa had difficulty running the coalition 
government because it was formed by seven parties and one 
parliamentary group. Former Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura needed to take a low profile as coordinator of the 
coalition partners, but he played into the hands of the news 
media which criticized "Mr. Ichiro Ozawa as a villain." As a 
result, Mr. Hosokawa stepped down as prime minister. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] A majority of JNP members favor breaking up 
the unified parliamentary group "Kaishin." What do you think? 
  Matsuoka: Even if the unified parliamentary group is 
dissolved, the SDPJ cannot return to the coalition government at 
the present stage. No decision has been made about the 
appointment of major posts in the parliamentary group. The 
parliamentary group is inconsequential. Our party cannot make 
any moves under present circumstances. Our party has no choice 
but to take a wait-and-see attitude. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] If the JNP asks the breakaway legislators 
and the SDPJ to return to the ruling coalition, what sort of 
political tactics is your party going to employ? 
  Matsuoka: I do not like the words political tactics, but 
what 
is important is purpose. As for the political tactics, the 
breakaway legislators and the SDPJ should have vigorously argued 
while remaining in the ruling coalition instead of complaining 
like defeatists. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] The SDPJ is indicating that it would return 
to the ruling coalition on the premise that the Hata cabinet 
resigns en masse. What is your comment? 
  Matsuoka: We intend to sincerely apologize the SDPJ for our 
impoliteness. An SDPJ leader has made ambivalent remarks that 
can be interpreted to mean either the SDPJ hopes for a 
dissolution of the House of Representatives or the SDPJ hopes 
for a general resignation of the Hata cabinet. The SDPJ leader, 
however, has proposed re- examining the framework of the 
coalition and his proposal is worthy of welcome. We are in 
contact with the SDPJ and we have a channel for the contact. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] The JNP is strengthening its ties with the 
DSP. 
  Matsuoka: The JNP and the DSP share almost the same 
political 
beliefs and policies. They are friendly toward each other, and 
they are in almost the same position. The two parties began 
their policy discussion from this week. I do not know whether 
the two parties will be merged into a new party. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] It has been decided that Masatoshi Miyama, 
Mr. Hosokawa's former secretary, will testify in the Diet. What 
is your opinion? 
  Matsuoka: Directors of the Budget Committee of the House of 
Representatives have decided to demand his testimony in the 
Diet. They have decided to make that demand after concluding 
that they can no longer delay the passage of the 1994 budget 
bill in the Diet. It is arrogant to use the parliamentary 
majority to force Mr. Miyama to testify in the Diet. They have 
set a bad precedent. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Mr. Hosokawa is expected to be unable to 
avoid testifying in the Diet. 
  Matsuoka: Mr. Hosokawa took full responsibility by resigning 
as prime minister. Thanks to Mr. Hosokawa, the rule of the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] has collapsed and the coalition 
government has come into being. In retaliation, the LDP is 
waging a campaign aimed at crushing the JNP and Mr. Hosokawa.

  [Text] Masayoshi Takemura, head of Sakigake [Harbinger], 
held a news conference in Matsue City on 29 May, in which he 
commented on the possibility of the cabinet resigning en masse 
to pave the way for the Social Democratic Party of Japan's 
[SDPJ] return to the coalition government. He said that his 
response to SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo's remark seeking 
the voluntary resignation of the cabinet was, "The SDPJ's return 
to the coalition by resigning en masse is improbable." This is 
an attempt to restrain ongoing moves in the SDPJ.

  [Text] It was disclosed on 30 May that an interparty 
policy group of liberals will be formed in June at the 
initiative of the Minshu no Kaze [Democratic Wind], a group of 
four defectors from the Japan New Party [JNP]. Members of the 
Minshu no Kaze intend to gather about 60 Dietmen from such 
parties as the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], the 
Sakigake [Harbinger], and the Group Seiun. Hokkaido Governor 
Takahiro Yokomichi, who recently announced his decision not to 
pursue his third reappointment as the governor, is also invited 
to the group to encourage his return to the Diet. The group 
probably intends to receive Yokomichi as a leader of liberals. 
  The policy group is expected to be called the "Council on 
Concept of Democrat Government" (tentative name), and the first 
preparatory meeting will be held on 1 June. Members of the 
Minshu no Kaze and SDPJ Deputy Secretary General Masanori Goto 
have informally asked Governor Yokomichi to join the group. 
Some of them want to receive Yokomichi as the leader of the 
group when he comes back to the Diet. Asked about this at the 
Hokkaido Prefectural Government on the morning of 30 May, 
Governor Yokomichi avoided making clear comments on his own 
position in the group, saying: "They are not asking me to 
become the leader (of the policy group). Since the group is 
designed as a gathering of Diet members, I am not going to do 
something special in the group."

<F P=106> [Report of roundtable discussion among Yoshiro Mori, general </F>
secretary of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP); Wataru Kubo, 
general secretary of the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
(SDPJ); Kozo Watanabe, acting general secretary of Shinseito 
(Japan Renewal Party); Takenori Kanzaki, floor leader of 
Komeito; Masuo Matsuoka, general secretary of the Japan New 
Party; Takashi Yonezawa, general secretary of the Democratic 
Socialist Party (DSP); and Hiroyuki Sonoda, general secretary of 
Sakigake (Harbinger); place and date not given] 
  The SDPJ's Kubo said the Hata cabinet should resign en 
masse before a no-confidence motion was submitted. This would 
pave the way for the establishment of a third coalition 
government. 
  Of the ruling party leaders, Komeito's Kanzaki agreed with 
Kubo, while Shinseito's Watanabe said it was "one of several 
choices," indicating he was sympathetic to the idea. 
  Asked about a possible tie-up with the LDP, Kubo said 
discussion should be promoted on policy matters and tactics for 
dealing with the political situation. The LDP's Mori indicated 
he looked forward to holding joint party consultations. 
  Kubo said: "The coalition should dissolve the current 
cabinet and consider how to form a new coalition government. 
The current cabinet will have no choice once a no-confidence 
motion against them has been adopted." 
  He added: "When a new coalition is formed, the leaders of 
all parties joining the coalition are qualified to become new 
prime minister. Mr. Hata is also qualified." 
  He stressed: "The SDPJ, on the assumption that it would be 
very difficult for the party to rejoin the current coalition, 
demands that a third coalition government be formed." 
  Shinseito's Watanabe said: "Prime Minister Hata also 
considers Mr. Kubo's idea is one of several choices. In this 
sense, I cannot say that it is beyond the bounds of possibility." 
  Komeito's Kanzaki backed Kubo's call for the Hata cabinet to 
resignat and the formation of a third coalition government. 
  Sakigake's Sonoda said: "Since Sakigake chose Mr. Hata as 
the new prime minister, and the Hata government has just been 
inaugurated, our party will not be able to support the 
no-confidence motion," indicating his party would nevertheless 
keep a close watch on developments. 
  The LDP's Mori said that dissolution of the lower house and 
general elections under the current electoral system were 
inevitable. 
  He added, though that the formation of a caretaker 
government 
tasked with holding general elections under the new electoral 
system was also one of the choices. 
  On the possibility of a tie-up between the LDP and the SDPJ, 
Kubo said: "We want to positively promote discussions between 
opposition parties in terms of maintaining parliamentary 
democracy." 
  He added: "On such important matters as the presentation of 
a no-confidence motion, I think we will be able to reach 
agreement through the process of thorough discussion between the 
two parties." 
  Mori said: "Even though the starting point is different, 
there is possibility of consulting with each other in the end."

  [Text] Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) subsidiary NTT 
International [Minato ward, Tokyo; Hideaki Kamitsuma, 
president], which engages in the design and sales of electrical 
communication systems from overseas sources, on 1 June will 
begin domestic sales of U.S.-made software used in developing 
systems for processing facsimile transmissions. The software 
enables the building of a system to integrate processing of 
voice and facsimile on a personal computer with only a 
voice-processing board and without installation of a 
facsimile-processing board, enabling addition of the function at 
about one-half of prior costs. 
  The subsidiary plans to capitalize on the introduction of 
the 
new software by expanding product offerings in the 
facsimile-processing equipment group. 
  The product that the subsidiary will sell on an exclusive 
basis is "Multifax" made by communications and data-processing 
equipment maker Commetrex (Atlanta, Georgia; Michael Coffey, 
president). The software enables installation of a system with 
as many as 2,148 circuits. Processing speeds are set at 9,600 
bits per second for transmissions and 4,800 per second for 
receipts. 
  The software is used in conjunction with a voice branch 
exchange (VBX) voice-processing board made by U.S. Natural 
Micro-System (NMS) Company. The system functions on top of a 
digital signal processor mounted with a voice-processing board 
and does not affect the performance of personal computers. 
  The subsidiary envisions development of software that will 
boost transmission and receiving speeds to 9,600 bits per second 
by this summer and is considering sales of communications modems 
in the future. 
  The price is set at 400,000 yen for the installation kit and 
7,500 yen for licensing of each circuit. Each additional 
personal computer connection will require a 12,000 yen fee for 
an unauthorized-software-copy prevention connector. The 
subsidiary has a goal for the first fiscal year of selling 
enough systems integrators developed through the use of NMS 
voice-processing boards to cover 300 circuits.

  [Text] The contents of a draft report on the package of 
concrete measures to relax regulations which will be mapped out 
in early June by the Administration and Finance Reform 
Subcommittee (chaired by Otohiko Endo, a Komeito legislator) -- 
under the Tax System Reform Council of the ruling parties -- 
came to light on 28 May. The draft report proposes that a 
system be created to provide information to companies desiring 
to participate in biddings for government procurement, and 
government procurement be opened to foreign enterprises by 
simplifying the current business registration procedure. The 
draft report calls for a sweeping review of regulations under 
individual laws on the air transportation, communications, and 
broadcasting sectors in order to encourage foreign investment in 
Japan. The draft report is believed to have been compiled with 
the aim of backing up Prime Minister Hata on the eve of the July 
summit talks (the Naples summit) of the industrialized nations 
by setting out a package of concrete deregulatory measures for 
government procurement, which has been a focal point in the 
Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks. 
  The Administration and Finance Reform Subcommittee is under 
the Tax System Reform Council, which is to draw up plans by the 
end of June for a sweeping reform of the current tax system. 
The subcommittee has set up four working groups mandated to 
study ways of keeping the raising of indirect taxes to a minimum. 
  The "deregulation and creation of new industry team," which 
is mandated to discuss ways to correct the price differentials 
between Japan and other nations and to rebuild Japan's 
industrial structure, has proposed a 35-sector type of 
deregulation. The draft report confines the deregulation to 30 
areas and presents a package of concrete measurements of their 
deregulation. The government is examining the possibility of 
incorporating the concrete measures in the second package of 
external economic measures to be mapped out in June. 
  The Foreign Ministry has not yet provided sufficient 
information to foreign firms eager to participate in biddings 
for government procurement. The draft report therefore stresses 
the need to establish a channel through which information in 
addition to the official gazette is supplied to foreign firms 
which are small in their size and which have no history of 
biddings for government procurement. The draft report calls on 
local autonomous governments to provide foreign firms with full 
information on their procurement procedures. With regard to the 
procedure of filing business registration applications, it is a 
mandatory to file individual business registration applications 
with the concerned bureau and department of each ministry and 
agency. The draft report proposes that the business 
registration application be filed with a single government 
office. 
  In pointing out that in the telecommunications industry, the 
international telephone industry, and the car phone industry "it 
is hard to think that foreign firms can easily participate in 
those fields and establish their vested interests," the draft 
report states unequivocally, "It is necessary to relax as many 
regulations as possible concerning foreign access to the 
telecommunications market and to remove regulations from the 
market." The draft report calls for simplifying the current 
license system in order for telecommunications companies to 
jointly use their facilities and mutually connect their 
facilities.

  [Text] Included on a "list of recommendations" for 
deregulation is the suggestion that if liquor sales were shifted 
from the current licence system to a reporting system, it would 
hold down the prices of liquor, increase the variety of liquor 
on the shelves of supermarkets, and benefit consumers. The list 
of recommendations is stirring controversy within the 
Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters (headed by Prime 
Minister Hata) and government ministries and agencies. The 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] has compiled 
the list of deregulation recommendations, taking into account 
trade requests from European nations and, according to a 
government source, many people rate the list highly as "an 
effective way to open the Japanese market." 
  The list of recommendations for deregulation, however, fails 
to include any matters under the jurisdiction of MITI and, 
according to a source in the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry 
and Fisheries, other government ministries and agencies have 
therefore reacted to it, saying, "At a time when we are 
struggling to come up with our deregulatory measures, MITI is 
interfering in the affairs of other ministries and agencies and 
leaving its own untouched by derregulation." 
  The battle over measures to relax bureaucratic regulations 
has begun to seem less like a "confrontation between government 
and the private sector" and more like a "confrontation between 
government ministries and agencies." 
  The list of recommendations for deregulation consists of two 
documents -- one for the deregulation of distribution and 
another for the deregulation of logistic distribution 
[butsuryu], standards, certification, and import procedures. 
The list of recommendations cites problems with regulation in 
16 areas, points out which areas should be deregulated and notes 
the effect this wi;; have. 
  The deregulation list proposes changing the current license 
system for liquor to a sales reporting system. It is currently 
under the jurisdiction of the Finance Ministry. To help 
importers, a similar change is proposed for perfume, a move 
which would follow the system widely adopted in the United 
States and Europe. Cosmetic sales currently fall under the 
authority of the Health and Welfare Ministry. 
  The list stresses that price differentials between Japan and 
other nations should be narrowed, claiming that prices of goods 
in Japan are two times higher than in the United States and 
Europe. 
  Commenting on the deregulation list, a businessman said it 
was a bold one and "contains some deregulatory steps that go 
beyond requests made by the private sector." 
  The Hata cabinet is pressing government ministries and 
agencies to map out a package of deregulatory measures by the 
end of June, a commitment made by Japan to the United States. 
Ministries and agencies, though, see the Hata administration as 
a minority government, and they are continuing to resist 
pressure to relax current regulations. 
  The same agriculture ministry source said: "The Hata cabinet 
believes that if it asks government ministries and agencies to 
shift to the reporting system, they would propose no 
deregulatory measures. It is, therefore, allotting a quota of 
deregulatory measures to each government ministry and agency 
saying, 'We hope your ministry will include this deregulatory 
step in the package'." 
  Such action shows the Hata cabinet is taking a tough stand 
on 
the government ministries and agencies as part of its efforts to 
push for deregulation. 
  The prevailing view is that MITI has secretly compiled the 
list of deregulation recommendations with the aim of using the 
current deregulation drive as an opportunity to instantly 
heighten the mood for deregulation in specific areas. 
  MITI Minister Eijiro Hata said the list would play a 
"pivotal 
role in relaxing Japan's bureaucratic regulations.". 
  The list, however, does not mention relaxation of the 
Large-Scale Retail Store Law nor the Provisional Law on the 
Import of Specific Oil Products, both of which are under MITI's 
jurisdiction. 
  For that reason, other government ministries and agencies 
are 
irritated by "MITI's attempts to win high marks" as the deadline 
looms for drawing up the deregulation package. 
  Officials in other government ministries are concerned that 
"the prime minister's official residence, which is looking for 
key areas for deregulation, may pick up ideas from the list of 
recommendations." 
  A senior MITI official does not deny compiling the list of 
recommendations, stressing: "If Japan fails to work to build 
new industries by correcting the price differentials between it 
and other nations, it will lose its international 
competitiveness."

  [Text] Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the Keidanren 
[Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan], called on Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata at the prime minister's official residence 
on the morning of 30 May. He asked Hata to resolutely implement 
deregulation after getting the fiscal 1994 budget bill passed by 
the Diet. In response, Hata showed a positive attitude toward 
promotion of deregulation, saying: "Unless deregulation and 
market opening are thoroughly carried out, yen's value will 
further appreciate." 
  Toyoda, who took office at a Keidanren general meeting on 27 
May, made a courtesy call on Hata. During the meeting, he 
explained his program of activities as the new chairman, saying: 
"Our slogans are bold concepts -- steady implementation, 
reform, creation, and trust. We act not for the major companies' 
interests but for those of the whole nation." 
  Toyoda further told Hata: "We would like the government to 
carry out deregulation particularly. Likewise, we would like to 
request the improvement of Japan-U.S. relationship, 
strengthening ties with Asian countries, political reform, and 
especially, enactment of the redistricting bill for the 
electoral system." In response, Hata said, "Although we are a 
minority government, neither the political reform nor the 
administrative reform are issues the opposition parties can 
oppose. Concerning tax system reform, there is also the basic 
agreement between the ruling and the opposition parties." He 
thus showed his strong resolution to implement these policies.

  [Text] Businesses are divided over additional deregulation 
measures the government plans to draw up by late June as part of 
a package of external economic measures. "The Five-man 
Committee on Administrative Reform," the gathering of top 
leaders of five major economic organizations, which has played a 
major role in pushing deregulation, cannot tell when it can meet 
again in face of objections from some business sectors. 
  Moreover, on 25 May, the Japan Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry issued a statement jointly with three organizations 
representing small and medium companies, declaring opposition to 
any further easing of the Large-Scale Retail Store Law. 
  So far feeling in the business world has in general kept 
step 
with moves to deregulate, but as the debate on deregulation 
enters its final stage, clear differences of view are emerging. 
  The Five-Man Committee on Administrative Reform was set up 
in 
February 1981 to give a push to the Ad Hoc Commission on 
Administrative Reform. At the time it was led by Toshio 
Tsuchimitsu and leaders from the Japan Federation of Economic 
Organizations [Keidanren], the Japan Association of Corporate 
Executives, the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the 
Kansai Economic Federation also took part. Last September the 
committee even invited Koshiro Ishida, director-general of the 
Management and Coordination Agency, to a meeting and handed him 
a statement giving its views on the need for deregulation. 
  Keidanren and other organizations have recently asked for a 
meeting of the influential committee to be called, the reason 
being they want to keep the business world informed about 
important issues such as the promotion of deregulation, and 
thereby reduce the resistance of bureaucrats who oppose the 
move. But a Keidanren official admitted: "We don't know when 
the meeting will be called because some organizations have since 
become hesitant about the idea; they are concerned that 
deregulation might adversely affect small and medium companies 
and employment figures." 
  Shoichiro Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor Corporation, who 
will be formally appointed as new Keidanren chairman on 27 May, 
regards deregulation as one of the most important tasks facing 
the country. 
  However, it looks as though he will face rough going in 
promoting it, given the conflicting views now arising among 
businesses on the issue of deregulation.

  [Text] Kan Kato, chairman of the government Tax Commission 
(prime minister's advisory panel), and Sakuei Matsumoto, deputy 
chairman of the commission, paid a call on Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata on the evening of 1 June, and urged him to go all 
out for administrative reform to give a big push to the tax 
system reform efforts. The prime minister showed strong 
ambition of completing plans on administrative reform by the 
target of the end of June, saying "We would like to come up with 
objectives and target dates (for administrative reform of 
central and local governments)." 
  In connection with the public utilities rates, a planned 
hike 
of which has recently been frozen by the government, the prime 
minister said, "We have to review organizations." He is 
believed to have made this remark in reference to Japan Highway 
Public Corporation and other special status corporations. It is 
likely that the question of making a drastic change of the 
organization of the special status corporations will come on the 
agenda of the government discussions with respect to the 
administrative reform. 
  In a news conference following the meeting with Hata, 
Chairman Kato said he had asked the prime minister, "Could you 
not formulate administrative reform five-year plans for central 
and local governments?" To that question, the prime minister 
replied, "I would like to come up with some kind of policy by 
the time the commission comes up with its recommendation." In 
addition, according to Kato, the prime minister said, "There 
should be no sacred areas (for administrative reform)." Hata 
thus showed his willingness to study the question of 
reorganizing the special status corporations and the issue of 
the number of local government officials. 
  Asked further about the special status corporations, 
Chairman 
Kato said, "I would be lying if I said he did not quote specific 
names." Prime Minister Hata apparently cited some names and 
talked about the intention of taking actions to reorganize them. 
Speaking on this issue, the prime minister also was quoted to 
have said, "When the freeze on the public utility rates is 
lifted eventually, we must ensure that the scale of a raise is 
kept to a minimum." He thus indicated that he would take active 
actions to study the question of reorganizing the special status 
corporations, which had intended to raise their utility charges. 
  Regarding a tax system reform that will feature the easing 
of 
individuals' income taxes and the raising of consumption tax, 
the government Tax Commission and the ruling parties' 
Consultative Committee on Tax System Reform are due to complete 
concrete plans by the end of June. It appears that Prime 
Minister Hata wants to give a push to the tax reform program by 
coming up with administrative reform plans by that time as well.

  [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT] 
will sponsor experiments on the nation's first high-volume 
optical fiber circuit. A research council will be established 
with representation from private computer and 
communications-related firms such as Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone (NTT), NEC and Japan IBM to engage in the development 
of technology to operate and utilize optical fiber circuits that 
have a capacity about 100 times that of high-speed 
communications networks currently in operation. The council will 
establish technology designed to build a foundation for a 
multimedia firm to integrate broadcasting and communications and 
will embrace the goal of catching up with the United States 
which currently leads in the move toward such a system. 
  The research council, which will operate under the 
sponsorship of the MPT is called "G (the first letter of the 
communications measurement unit, gigabit) Net Association." The 
general meeting to inaugurate the council will be held in the 
first part of June and, besides the three firms mentioned above, 
will be attended by Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD), NHK [Japan 
Broadcasting Corporation], Fujitsu, Hitachi, Japan Digital 
Equipment, Japan Sun Microsystems, and Japan Cray. Experiments 
are scheduled to begin in September 1994. 
  NTT will link 10 cities, including Tokyo and Osaka, 
throughout the nation with optical fiber cables capable of 
transmitting data at the rate of 156 megabits per second and 
offer their use free of charge for the experiments. Firms 
participating in the experiments will link their firms' research 
facilities with such cables and conduct tests in the area of 
computer networks, television conferences, and remote medical 
services. 
  The Telecommunications Council, an advisory organ of the 
MPT, 
will complete a report providing a blueprint for the 
construction of an information infrastructure designed for a 
sophisticated information society of the 21st century. The MOPT 
will consider the G-Net Association experiments as a precursor 
of the type of pioneering experimental projects sought by the 
report and intends to offer low-interest loans in support of 
such projects. 
  Since 1990, the United States has established a National 
Research and Education Network (NREN) plan as one phase of the 
National Information Infrastructure (NII). Already feasibility 
experiments have been initiated at five sites throughout the 
United States. NREN's budget for fiscal year 1994 totaled about 
$170 million. MPT plans to develop the G-Net Association project 
into a rival of the NREN plan.

  [Text] Forces of the rebel Shan warlord Khun Sa have 
pushed to within 6 km of the strategic eastern Burmese town of 
Tachilek, where 700 government troops face food and water 
shortages, a rebel source said yesterday. 
  "We hope to capture Tachilek," an official of Khun Sa's Mong 
Tai army said. "Our men are very near to the town and the 
defenders are nearly out of food." 
  Last week the rebels, mostly members of Burma's minority 
Shan 
population, reportedly stormed three Rangoon government bases 
near Tachilek and blew up a dam at the town's main reservoir. 
  Heavy fighting at the three government outposts on hills 
surrounding Tachilek between May 17 and 27 resulted in the 
deaths of 160 Burmese troops and 80 wounded, according to the 
Mong Tai army official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He 
said 17 Mong Tai army troop were killed in the fighting and 
another 39 were wounded. 
  Tachilek is the main border trade link to the northernmost 
Thai town of Mae Sai, 1,165 km north of Bangkok. 
  Burmese forces had been reinforced in the area in recent 
months in anticipation of a major offensive, but the Shan rebels 
launched a series of attacks two weeks ago that appeared to put 
Rangoon government troops on the defensive. 
  The Mong Tai army official said two Burmese military jets 
based at an air base at Tachilek flew two sorties May 17-18 
during fierce fighting around the village of Mong Kyawt, about 
24 km from the Thai border. He said the Burmese jets dropped 
bombs from a high altitude because "they are afraid of our 
missiles." 
  Khun Sa's army, financed through taxes on opium caravans and 
heroin refineries in the Shan State, is equipped with 
surface-to-air missiles. 
  The half-Shan, half-Chinese warlord has been indicted on 
drug 
trafficking charges by a US federal court. 
  A Thai Third Army officer at the border identified the 
Burmese jets as F-7 fighter-bombers, which had been purchased by 
the Rangoon government from China. 
  The fighting in Burma has forced hundreds of Shan, Akha and 
Lahu tribesmen to seek shelter in Thailand because they fear 
being rounded up and forced to carry munitions for the Burmese. 
  Burma's military government, which has been trying to 
establish its control in the Shan State and other rebel-held 
areas for more than 40 years, routinely uses press-ganged 
civilian "porters" to carry supplies.

  [Text] Opium Warlord Khun Sa is financing the Karen 
National Union [KNU], led by Gen Bo Mya, in an attempt to 
strengthen the fighting alliance against the Burmese government, 
a reliable source said. 
  Financial support from Khun Sa is believed to total up to 
three million baht, which was handed over to the KNU at a 
meeting in Maneplaw between April 15-17, the source added. 
  Maj-Gen Tun of Khun Sa's Muang Tai Army [MTA] led the 
representative from Shan State in a meeting with Karen guerrilla 
leaders, the source claimed an intelligence report as saying. 
Both sides received their respective benefits from the move, 
the source remarked. 
  Khun Sa gave financial support to the KNU to secure shipment 
of heroin from the Golden Triangle, the source said adding that 
the first shipment would be from Shan State down the Salween 
River to Moulmein. 
  Khun Sa wanted the shipment secured as it passes areas 
influenced by the KNU, according to the source. 
  The KNU, on the other hand, is believed to be seeking 
financial support from the opium warlord to stage its 
anti-Burmese government operations. The move is the latest 
development between Gen Bo Mya and Khun Sa whose first contact 
was believed to have been in 1991. 
  Their meeting was designed to strengthen the two 
anti-government groups in fighting Burmese government forces. 
  Prior to the recent secret meeting, both sides met at least 
twice in March and early April to discuss cooperative efforts 
against the Burmese regime. 
  The source said the first shipment of drugs is expected to 
take place after fighting between the MTA and government forces 
subsides, which is expected soon due to the approaching rainy 
season, the source said. 
  The ongoing fighting is seen as an attempt by Khun Sa to 
demonstrate a show of strength and to boost confidence within 
his heroin buying network, the source pointed out. 
  Officials of Khun Sa's Muang Tai Army, contacted by BANGKOK 
POST yesterday, declined comment on the matter.

  [Text] The Burmese junta's fragile ceasefire agreement 
with some of its rival ethnic guerrilla groups is facing 
breakdown with the possibility that fighting will re-erupt in 
the northeastern Shan State. 
  Intelligence and ethnic sources monitoring the situation 
along the Thai-Burmese border said several of the 11 armed 
ethnic groups which are party to the ceasefire have expressed 
their frustration over Rangoon's indifference to their political 
objectives and demands for greater autonomy. 
  The groups have come to realize that they have little or 
nothing to gain from the truce while the junta, better known as 
the State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc), has 
exploited the situation by claiming all the credit for the peace 
pact, the sources said. 
  Most ethnic groups have not openly aired their 
dissatisfaction. But the Wa guerrillas, the strongest group and 
the first to strike a truce with Rangoon in 1989, have stood up 
to express their views. 
  Forming the major and grassroots component of the Burma 
Communist Party, the Wa in early 1989 revolted against the 
ageing Maoist leaders and seized control of the communist 
headquarters as well as large stocks of heavy weaponry and 
ammunition supplied to the Party during the communist heyday by 
China. 
  Karen leader Gen Bo Mya said recently he had received 
information that some of the 11 armed ethnic groups "are very 
frustrated" that there have been no political developments or 
negotiations since the ceasefire was agreed. Some groups have 
threatened to break the truce. 
  "There is no progress. They were told that if they want to 
talk politics they must first lay down their arms and return to 
the legal fold," he said. 
  Bo Mya also predicted that fighting would re-erupt. The 
Karen leader's statement was confirmed by intelligence sources 
and a Wa official who requested anonymity. 
  The official told THE NATION that the Wa are disappointed 
with Rangoon's rejection of their demands for a Wa State. He 
said bilateral relations have been "very tense" lately following 
several incidents. 
  Among others, Rangoon has refused to consider or discuss a 
proposal for the setting-up of the Wa State submitted by Wa 
representatives to the National Convention, he said. The 
convention was arbitrarily set up early last year by the Slorc 
to draft the country's new constitution. 
  "The draft constitution only mentions seven states and seven 
divisions," which do not include the Wa State, the official said. 
  He said a senior leader of the United Wa State Party 
travelled from the Wa headquarters at the Sino-Burmese border in 
Shan State to Rangoon at the end of April to reiterate the 
groups' demand for a separate state. He said the Wa had 
threatened to break the ceasefire deal with Rangoon unless their 
demands for statehood were responded to positively. 
  "Just after we celebrated our 5th anniversary of the Wa 
revolution against the Burma Communist Party on April 17, a Wa 
leader went down to Rangoon. He warned the Slorc that without a 
genuine Wa State, the (Wa-Slorc) ceasefire would not last long," 
he said. 
  The Wa official, however, said he did not know if the Wa 
leader had yet returned from Rangoon and could not confirm a 
report that he had been detained in Rangoon since the end of 
April. 
  He said other armed groups were also unhappy with the Slorc 
indifference to their political cause and demands for political 
discussion but did not openly show their dissatisfaction due to 
the military weakness of the groups. 
  "The Wa is holding the key to the success of the Slorc's 
truce with other ethnic groups. If the Wa ceasefire breaks 
down, other groups will follow suit as we are the largest 
group," he said. 
  The Slorc has for the past several years pressed the Wa to 
reduce the number of its estimated 25,000-30,000 troops to 
3,000, a demand rejected outright by the ethnic guerrillas. 
  The latest incident contributing to the worsening of 
Slorc-Wa 
relations was the Wa's discovery at the end of January of 87 C-3 
and G-4 guns hidden in 3,000 sacks of rice rationed every month 
to the guerrillas as part of the bilateral ceasefire agreement, 
according to the Wa official.

<F P=106> [Interview with PDK Chairman Khieu Samphan by unidentified </F>
station correspondent on 31 May; place not given -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] My respects to His Excellency Mr. 
Chairman. You just returned from the roundtable in Pyongyang. 
How did this meeting proceed? 
  [Khieu Samphan] I thank you, who represent the Voice of the 
Great National Union Front of Cambodia. The Party of Democratic 
Kampuchea [PDK] was very glad that a roundtable was held among 
all Cambodian parties, for it was the profound aspiration of our 
entire nation and people. Our nation and people had called 
repeatedly for such a roundtable, but it had not been possible 
because of opposition. 
  I led a delegation of Democratic Kampuchea to the roundtable 
with a profound desire for national reconciliation and peace so 
that all our forces become reunified, our country can enjoy true 
and lasting peace, and all our people both in the countryside 
and in Phnom Penh who have been victims of the war and have 
suffered for so many years get a chance to live and work in 
peace and happiness. I joined the meeting with those wishes in 
mind. 
  The PDK sought by all means to hold sincere discussions and 
consultations so that the aspirations of our nation and people 
for national reconciliation and peace can be achieved as soon as 
possible. 
  [Correspondent] As a matter of fact, what proposals did the 
PDK make so that national reconciliation and peace can be 
achieved? 
  [Khieu Samphan] For national reconciliation, I proposed that 
consultations be held to work out a formulation, that is, to 
formulate a minimal policy program according to which all 
parties would agree to set up a national government and national 
army of which all Cambodian parties would be members. The 
consultations should be made in the spirit of reconciliation and 
all parties should make concessions to one another as suggested 
all along by the king. We should look into possible ways to let 
the PDK join a national government and a national army, ways to 
bring all Cambodian parties into the national government and 
national army, and ways for the PDK to transfer the zones that 
it controls to the national government and for its army to be 
integrated into the national army. 
  Most important of all, however, was the fact that we should 
consult with one another so we can agree on a minimal policy 
program first. Only after we have this minimal policy program 
do we have a specific basis that all parties can accept and 
follow, both now that we are working on national reconciliation 
and in the future when the national government and national army 
with all Cambodian parties as members will begin their 
operations. 
  [Correspondent] What reaction did the two-headed government 
have to your proposal? 
  [Khieu Samphan] Hun Sen was the one who talked on behalf of 
the two-headed government. He only talked about a cease-fire. 
He did not say anything about national reconciliation or how to 
bring about lasting peace. He refused to talk about national 
reconciliation and national concord. On the contrary, he put 
forth three points which were conditions set by the communist 
Vietnamese and the alliance to do away with the PDK and block 
national reconciliation and peace. 
  In my opinion, the national forces of all parties should be 
brought together on the basis of a clear-cut policy program 
accepted by everybody to achieve national reconciliation. This 
does not mean that a party should be integrated into another 
party. 
  Up to the present, there has never been national 
reconciliation; there has been only war. If we continue on the 
old road, there will never be national reconciliation at all; 
the foreigners will continue to interfere, to ignite the war. 
For this reason, we should work for national reconciliation and 
for a permanent end to the war. In order to achieve national 
reconciliation and put a permanent end to the war, there should 
be a minimal policy program that all parties agree to accept and 
implement. 
  This minimal policy program is a commitment to be respected 
by both Cambodians and foreigners in Cambodia alike. So far, 
there has never been any national reconciliation or rallying of 
the national forces. It is for this reason that the foreigners 
-- be it the Vietnamese or the alliance -- have interfered in 
our affairs and continued to ignite the war that lays waste to 
our country. National reconciliation and the rallying of 
national forces is more important than anything else. It is the 
water that could put out the flames of war. It directly 
concerns the life or death of our Cambodian nation and race. 
  [Correspondent] Why did Hun Sen refuse to talk about 
national reconciliation and insist only on the cease-fire 
without any specific supervision? 
  [Khieu Samphan] During the meeting, I repeatedly stressed 
that the key to the problem is national reconciliation. All 
Cambodian parties must do their best to forge national 
reconciliation in order to end the war at its roots. The 
cease-fire issue should be settled within the framework of a 
solution on national reconciliation. We should not have a 
cease-fire just in order to make preparations for further 
fighting. 
  I recalled to mind some past experiences in the world. I 
cited the example of the communist Vietnamese taking advantage 
of the 1968 Tet cease-fire in order to prepare forces and send 
arms to attack Saigon. I also recalled the experiences of our 
own nation. The Paris agreement was a very important document. 
It was a document of international stature. Its objective was 
clear: 
  1. To supervise the withdrawal of all foreign forces from 
Cambodia. 
  2. To secure a quadripartite national reconciliation in 
the form of the Supreme National Council with the then head of 
state Prince Norodom Sihanouk as chairman. 
  But the Paris agreement was torn to shreds and trampled 
underfoot. There was no supervision to ascertain that the 
foreign forces --namely, the aggressor communist Vietnamese 
forces -- had completely withdrawn from Cambodia. The 
quadripartite Supreme National Council was given no significant 
role at all. The quadripartite national reconciliation was 
aborted. Attempts were made to eliminate and destroy the PDK. 
All these incidents were about foreigners opposing our national 
reconciliation and continuing to ignite the flames of war. To 
this day, everybody knows how badly the war has affected our 
nation. Despite all of that, I informed the meeting 
participants that so long as we Cambodians tried our best we 
would succeed as we had all the capabilities and the support of 
our nation and people in achieving national reconciliation and 
true and lasting peace. 
  I repeatedly talked about it and yet the others insisted 
they 
did not hear, they did not understand, and they did not agree to 
discuss the question of national reconciliation. To accept 
national reconciliation means to stop seeking each other's 
destruction, to stop fighting each other forever, and to join 
hands in solving all problems, large or small, of the nation. 
Why did they refuse to discuss national reconciliation? It was 
known to all that before and during the roundtable the United 
States, Australia, and France were very busy mustering arms for 
the two-headed government. They talked outwardly about a 
cease-fire, but in concrete actions they were preparing forces 
and weapons to continue igniting the flames of war. In fact, 
they needed the time to prepare forces, muster arms, and 
transport them for stockpiling on each battlefield so they could 
continue to ignite the war against their own nation and people. 
  [Correspondent] In your opinion, what will happen in the 
future? 
  [Khieu Samphan] It is my prayer that there will be national 
reconciliation and genuine peace so that our nation and people 
can be happy and live their normal lives. The entire Democratic 
Kampuchea, the entire Cambodian nation and people want national 
reconciliation and peace. All of us want to continue the 
consultations and discussions in order to find a way to solve 
the national reconciliation problem. Our nation and people 
clearly see who continues to ignite the war and cause them 
suffering, deaths, separations, woes, and pains. They are: 
  1. The communist Vietnamese who continue to ignite their war 
of aggression in Cambodia so they can take the opportunity to 
send Vietnamese nationals into Cambodia as illegal immigrants in 
accordance with their strategy of swallowing up Cambodia through 
demographic warfare. 
  2. The Western alliance bad elements who join hands with the 
communist Vietnamese in continuing to ignite the latter's war of 
aggression so they can take the opportunity to interfere in 
Cambodia's Internal affairs and push Cambodia into their sphere 
of influence. 
  Our nation and people clearly know and see who are 
continuing 
to follow and abide by the orders of the foreigners who oppose 
national reconciliation and continue igniting the flames of war. 
Our people are opposed resolutely to these elements. 
  Our nation and people are well aware of the roots of their 
sorrow and misery. National problems have not been solved nor 
have we solved social problems. On the contrary, they have 
steadily deteriorated and placed heavy pressure on the 
livelihood of each family both in Phnom Penh and the 
countryside. Therefore, the desire for national reconciliation, 
the desire for a permanent end to the war has become the wishes, 
the vital aspirations of each family of our people. It has 
become an extraordinarily powerful force that calls for national 
reconciliation, an end to the war, and peace -- a force opposed 
to foreigners providing arms to the two-headed government to 
enable it to continue igniting the war, opposed to forcible 
recruitment, and opposed to forcing the people to serve as 
militiamen and reserve forces for inter-Cambodia killings. 
  Our nation and people have seen through the ugly schemes of 
the communist Vietnamese, alliance, and two-headed government. 
Our nation and people, our entire nation is resolutely opposed 
to all these dark designs. This is the invincible force driving 
for national reconciliation.

  [Text] [Passage indistinct] of this inter-Cambodian control 
commission. At this point, the Kingdom of Cambodia had already 
presented its candidates for this commission. 
  "The delegation also proposed that simultaneously with the 
cease-fire, an agreement in principle be adopted in order to 
immediately create the inter-Cambodian Control Commission as a 
mechanism to control and monitor without delay the cease-fire. 
  "The delegation fully supported His Majesty's clear-sighted 
and sacred idea on the solemn declaration of fidelity for 
Cambodia as a state of unity without partition and secession, 
within its own territorial integrity (the internationally 
recognized borders between 1963-1969), of peace, solidarity, 
national unity and prosperity in the concerted efforts for 
national construction. 
  "Unfortunately, the initiatives on the standstill, 
unconditional, immediate, total, durable, and irreversible 
cease-fire all over the territory of Cambodia at the 
above-mentioned date and time [15 June] had been categorically 
rejected by Mr. Khieu Samphan, leader of the Khmer Rouge, 
despite the insisted appeal made by His Majesty the King and the 
two Preah Sangkhareach [supreme patriarchs], Samdech Preah 
Monkol Tepeacha and Samdech Moha Khousananda. 
  "Instead firstly, Mr. Khieu Samphan urged that this 
cease-fire process be controlled and monitored by some foreign 
countries. A list of ten countries was submitted by Mr. Khieu 
Samphan for consideration, five of which had to be selected to 
control and monitor the cease-fire. It is worthy to note that 
the ten proposed countries are all full members of the United 
Nations that had bitter experiences with the Khmer Rouge during 
the process of implementing the Paris peace agreements. 
  "Secondly, the Khmer Rouge urged the delegation of the 
Kingdom of Cambodia to accept the formulation of the so-called 
"minimal policy program" before proceeding to the discussion on 
His Majesty's proposed cease-fire. This minimal policy program 
is nothing but its aims at dissolving the legal and legitimate 
institution of the Kingdom of Cambodia -- the National Assembly 
and Royal Government of Cambodia -- issued from the UN-organized 
and supervised general elections. 
  "On 28 May 1994, the participants to this roundtable talk 
had 
agreed to issue a joint communique by which a roundtable working 
group for peace and national reconciliation under the 
chairmanship of the royal representative of His Majesty the King 
-- Samdech Chakrei Nhoek Chulong -- be set up to further their 
discussion. This working group, which will consist of four 
representatives from the Kingdom of Cambodia and four others 
from the Khmer Rouge group, will hold its first meeting on June 
15, 1994 at Damnak Chan in the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh. 
  "Throughout this roundtable talk, it is an undeniable fact 
that the Khmer Rouge revealed their intention not to seek a 
solution to the remaining Cambodian problems by political means, 
but to resort to their stalled tactics of "fight talk, fight 
talk." Worse still, they had striven to internationalize the 
remaining internal problems existing among Cambodians to 
dismantle the National Assembly and the Royal Government of 
Cambodia, internationally recognized through UN-sponsored free 
and fair general elections of May 1993. It goes without saying 
that the cease-fire, which was the outstanding and main topic of 
this roundtable talk could not be achieved due to the 
intransigent opposition of the Khmer Rouge."

  [Text] A crackdown on illegal logging activities in Koh 
Kong Province -- conducted jointly by a deputy state secretary 
for economy and finance and a deputy state secretary for 
agriculture -- has proven successful. The five-day raid was 
launched on a hideout in the province where lawless activities 
took place to destroy trees and export logs. Four foreign 
barges loaded with some 5,000 cubic meters of wood were seized 
pending a decision by the government in accordance with the law. 
  Chea Peng-chheang, deputy state secretary for economy and 
finance, told REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA upon his return to Phnom Penh 
on the afternoon of 25 May that the operation had been 
successful. There were no clashes or casualties even though the 
stronghold the operational team raided -- where destructively 
felled trees were stored for unlawful export -- had previously 
been inaccessible. The deputy state secretary added: We seized 
a crane, four barges, and 500 cubic meters of logs suspected of 
being illegal. 
  A Singapore company called Maxtron, the owner of one of the 
four seized barges, is angry about the crackdown, arguing that 
it forgot to bring its authorization along on the barge, and 
that it had permission and paid taxes for the export of 1,000 
cubic meters of wood, including the seized logs. Who would have 
dared to issue such authorization? 
  Commenting on this issue, Chea Peng-chheang said: We have 
not yet made any decision on the seizure. It is up to the 
government to solve this problem. 
  May Sam-oeun, the deputy state secretary for agriculture who 
also participated in leading the operation, said: The seizure 
of those barges was correct. The Agriculture Ministry is 
perfectly entitled to make arrests and seize the means of 
transportation and logs if the owners do not have authorization. 
The ban on log exports became effective 1 April 1994. 
  It should be pointed out that the crackdown on illegal 
logging was launched following a report that the illegal export 
of logs from Koh Kong Province was continuing, and after a 
terrifying clash between a combined team that sealed the Sre 
Ambel pass and a gang protecting the log export merchants. 
  May Sam-oeun added: We achieved complete success this time, 
unlike the unsuccessful operations we carried out with forestry 
officials in recent months. Some of those officials, he added, 
continue to issue log export authorizations to a number of 
foreign companies in violation of the government's ban on log 
exports. He did not elaborate on the cause of the first 
operation's failure. 
  Commenting on the capture of two members of the combined 
team 
by the gang protecting the log exporters following a clash on 18 
May, Chea Peng-chheang said: These two officials have already 
been released unharmed by the gang without any preconditions. 
The primary goal of the 130-member operational team was to 
crack down on the armed gang that fired at a combined team in 
Sre Ambel. They all fled before the reinforcement group 
arrived, however. It is not yet known who the ringleader of the 
gang is, but there is already a hint about his identity.

  [Text] It was reported that on 25 May, 240 soldiers of the 
puppet units in Takeo Province who were sent by the two-headed 
government to fight on the Route 10 battlefield deserted the 
action. 
  The report said that these soldiers who were sent from Takeo 
Province to Route 10 by their puppet commanders did not want to 
fight and kill fellow Cambodians. They want peace and national 
reconciliation so that they can return to their parents, wives, 
and children. 
  The report added that these puppet soldiers from Takeo 
Province have seen with their own eyes how hundreds of the 
two-headed government's soldiers from both the Vietnamese and 
U.S. puppet groups were killed and wounded every day. Some 
stepped on land mines or were attacked by the National Army of 
Democratic Kampuchea, while others were shot dead by the 
communist Vietnamese and U.S. puppet commanders who were angry 
that the two categories of puppet soldiers kept refusing to 
fight. Some of them died of malaria and a shortage of food and 
medicine. Under such conditions, the two categories of puppet 
soldiers mobilized from all areas have continued to desert the 
battlefield in groups of 10, 20, and even hundreds. The fleeing 
puppet soldiers do not hesitate to shoot at anyone who tries to 
stop them.

  [Excerpts] It was reported that on 25 and 26 May, the 
Vietnamese killed two Cambodians and wounded five others while 
Cambodians killed 30 Vietnamese and burned 60 brick houses and 
27 sampans. 
  The report said that about 500 Vietnamese families totaling 
some 3,000 persons have occupied the (Kbal Tao) area along Tonle 
Sap lake in Pursat Province. They control all land and 
waterways in the area, where there are all sorts of facilities 
resembling a floating city for the Vietnamese. 
  As for the Cambodian people, they cannot earn their living 
independently because (Kbal Tao) belongs to the Vietnamese. The 
Cambodians can earn a living only by catching fish for the 
Vietnamese boss. [passage omitted] 
  While the Vietnamese earn from 50,000 to 100,000 riel from 
selling fish caught by Cambodians, the Cambodian workers do not 
have enough to eat. 
  On the afternoon of 25 May, about 30 Cambodian workers 
returned from fishing to ask the Vietnamese employer for their 
weekly pay. They told the boss that they wanted to go home to 
grow rice because the planting season has come. The Vietnamese 
employer told his 12-year-old (?son) to give a glass of liquor 
to each Cambodian worker and told the workers that he would not 
give them pay and rice this week, as the pay and rice would be 
given only after they finished working at the end of June when 
the fishing season ended. After arguing for a while, both sides 
were furious. [passage omitted] 
  The boss then drew an AK rifle from his table and shot at 
the 
workers, killing two and wounding five others. The dead and 
wounded fell down from the brick house. The boss continued 
firing at the workers, who fled unhurt. 
  At 2100 on 26 May, while the Vietnamese men and women were 
drinking and watching television under the bright electric 
light, every brick house and sampan were burning. [passage 
omitted] Suddenly, the fire blazed up brightly. 
  Next morning, eyewitnesses said that 30 Vietnamese men and 
women were killed and 60 brick houses and 27 sampans were 
burned. [passage omitted] Who killed these Vietnamese? Who set 
fire to this floating Vietnamese city? What devices were used? 
Was it a bomb, a resin torch, or turpentine? Some said 
everything, even fuel oil, could be found in (Kbal Tao).

  [Text] According to a report from Chhlong District of 
Kratie Province, on 11 May at a ceremony held at the provincial 
office of the Cambodian People's Party, the communist Vietnamese 
puppets' military commander in Kratie Province provided arms to 
hundreds of Vietnamese families to protect themselves and 
threaten the Cambodians. 
  The people said that almost all of the Vietnamese settlers 
in 
Cambodia are already armed. By providing them with more arms, 
the Vietnamese will increase their activities, including 
bullying, robbing, and massacring the Cambodian people in 
Chhlong District. 
  The Vietnamese men and women in the district have all along 
been arrogant and hostile and have acted as masters of the 
Cambodian land and sea and plundered Cambodian property. 
Nevertheless, the communist Vietnamese puppets have given them 
more weapons. 
  The people said that these Vietnamese monsters are 
controlling and lording over almost all of the territory in 
Chhlong District. This is a grave threat arising from the 
Vietnamese and the traitorous acts committed by the communist 
Vietnamese puppets. 
  Every Cambodian is furious and angry with the 
Vietnamese-headed Cambodians who have sold out our nation and 
land. Take a look at the areas in Kratie Province bordering 
Vietnam. Vietnamese men and women are moving in and out of 
Cambodia to plunder our resources and drive Cambodians off their 
land. They have taken a large portion of Cambodian territory. 
  The Vietnamese have taken control of all the rubber 
plantations in Snuol District. They have sent Cambodian rubber 
for sale in Vietnam in exchange for dollars, while Cambodian 
workers receive nothing. They have also felled Cambodian trees 
and sent them to Vietnam. 
  The people said the Cambodians cannot tolerate this 
traitorous act of the communist Vietnamese puppets and the 
Vietnamese occupation of Cambodian territory. 
  The people in Chhlong District and elsewhere now realize 
that 
our nation will not survive under the old Vietnamese puppets who 
have served as out-and-out lackeys of the Vietnamese since 1979 
and the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, 
Neutral Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] which has followed 
in the footsteps of the Vietnamese puppets. Thus, the people 
have no other alternative but to jointly struggle to drive all 
Vietnamese men and women out of our Cambodian territory. Only 
by so doing can we defend our nation and race.

  [Text] The Vietnamese troops who came and planted rice on 
Cambodian land in Boreicholasa Disitrict, Takeo Province, late 
last year (19 December 1993) recently pulled back to Vietnam 
after harvesting all their crops. 
  Mr. Hah Saret, governor of Boreicholasa District, said 
without the strong efforts of all of us Cambodians, especially 
the provincial leadership, these Vietnamese troops would never 
have withdrawn. He expressed concern that similar incidents 
would again happen in the future if our border is not clearly 
demarcated. 
  The problem of Vietnamese intruding into our land and 
planting rice there or just plain illegal immigration takes 
place every year and has to be settled every year with no end in 
sight. 
  The district governor went on to reveal that along Takeo 
Province's border with Vietnam there was an artificial canal dug 
up during the time of Mr. Pol Saroeun, who was then the 
province's governor (of the former State of Cambodia), to 
prevent Vietnamese infiltration into Cambodian territory. This 
canal was quite effective. However, whenever it got damaged or 
dried up, problems normally arose. It has been frequently 
observed that the Cambodian side rarely intrudes into Vietnam, 
whereas the Vietnamese usually cross over this side of the 
border. 
  It was noted that the withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops 
who 
intruded into our land to grow rice was prompted by the pledge 
made following talks between the leadership of Takeo Province 
and that of Vietnam's An Giang Province earlier this year. The 
Takeo provincial leadership made three attempts to solve this 
problem with the leadership of Chau Doc District and An Giang 
Province before it was successful. 
  Mr. Su Phirin, governor of Takeo Province, once told 
REAKSMEI 
KAMPUCHEA that the latest round of talks with the Vietnamese 
side was most difficult because the Vietnamese claimed that the 
contested area belonged to them. They said they had heard 
repeated pleas from Takeo Province for years and they were 
determined not to give up the land as in the past. The governor 
said that before we could reach any agreement, we had to make a 
lot of inquiries, confrontations, and persuasions and we spent 
so much time doing just that. Mr. Phirin wished to see the 
border clearly and quickly demarcated to avoid similar border 
disputes in the future. 
  It should be recalled that the site where the Vietnamese 
troops came to grow rice is located in Cheychouk Commune, 
Boreicholasa Disitrict. The area is 50 to 70 meters deep and 
1,500 meters wide inside Cambodian territory. These Vietnamese 
intruders are troops from Chau Doc District. They came to grow 
rice in groups of 40 to 50 persons, each armed with automatic 
guns and sometimes heavy weapons. This made the situation much 
more explosive than before when only unarmed civilians came in 
to grab land to plant rice or simply to set up domicile. The 
latter would pull out whenever our district armed forces 
intervened. But recently, it was the Vietnamese troops 
themselves who had intruded. 
  Some of the views admitted that it was great the Vietnamese 
troops had agreed to withdraw. But one thing they were most 
concerned about was that these troops might return in the future 
as there is already a precedent. 
  According to the provincial governor, every year when the 
rice planting dry-season comes, the problem of Vietnamese coming 
in to plant rice on Cambodian land always arises because the 
soil in Vietnam is not as productive as in Cambodia. 
  Another problem that frequently occurs is the renting of 
land 
to the Vietnamese by some of our own Cambodian citizens. This 
is a dangerous practice. Moreover, the governor of Boreicholasa 
Disitrict has complained that he cannot control every part of 
the sparsely populated, and vast land area (240 square 
kilometers) with few roads, as most of it is inundated. 
Moreover, during the dry season access is easier from the 
Vietnamese than from the Cambodian side. Nevertheless, he 
showed his strong determination to fully preserve the 
territorial integrity of Boreicholasa District. 
  It is to be noted that Boreicholasa is a new district of 
Takeo Province created in December 1987. It is currently has 
18,362 inhabitants, mostly farmers and fishermen. The creation 
of this district was Takeo Province's strategy against the 
influx of illegal Vietnamese immigrants.

  [Text] An official of the National Bank of Cambodia [NBC] 
has revealed that from now on the state banks will halt their 
joint ventures with the private sector. He said the state has 
established joint ventures with five out of the nearly 30 
private banks, such as the Overseas Commercial Bank, the 
Cambodian Public Bank, Canadian Bank, and the Metropolitan 
Corporation Bank. 
  In joint ventures with the private sector, some state-owned 
banks have a small share, while others have larger amounts. But 
in general, the shares of state banks are from the 
diversification of their immovable assets in proportion to their 
value, as agreed upon with each commercial bank. 
  This state policy to halt joint ventures with private banks 
has already been promulgated by the NBC. However, the result of 
its implementation is not yet known. The NBC has withdrawn its 
capital from the private banks at the proposal of the Asian 
Development Bank [ADB]. The ADB has suggested that since the 
NBC is within the state structure, it does not need to establish 
other joint ventures with the private sector. The national bank 
should think only about improving its work and efficiency. 
  This official added that the joint state-private banking 
system has been used in the last four to five years because the 
nation has moved from a centralized economy to a free market. 
This is because in the centrally-planned system, all banks, 
like the factories and enterprises nationawide, were under the 
control of the state, which would bear all their profits and 
losses. But since the political system has changed, the economy 
should also change likewise. 
  It should be recalled that during the past few years, the 
NBC 
has generated income for the state amounting up to billions of 
riel annually. 
  According to the private bank law, a private bank will be 
permitted to open a banking business only with a capital of $5 
million upwards. Moreover, each bank, big or small, is 
duty-bound to pay the state 50 million riel annually as business 
tax. 
  It is learned that as of 31 May this year, the NBC plans to 
stop allowing private-own commercial bank to open in Cambodia. 
However, there will be some special cases concerning private 
banks. That is, permission will be given only to the private 
banks from big countries such as the United States, Japan, 
France, Australia, and Canada.

  [Text] Phnom Penh -- Banks function to take deposits and 
make loans to the public. On either side of the balance sheet, 
the National Bank of Cambodia's [NBC] Economic and Monetary 
Statistics Review for February aims to deliver an optimistic 
report. 
  "In the banking sector, one feature which needs to be 
highlighted is the buoyancy in deposits growth," it said. 
  "It may be recalled that aggregate deposits had shown a dip 
in November 1993. There was a recovery in December 1993. The 
growth in deposits during the first two months of 1994 has been 
remarkable with an increase of more than 30 billion riels 
witnessed in each of these months," the report added. 
  The NBC links the increase to foreign currency deposits 
which 
reached a new height of 180 billion riels in February. It would 
be even more encouraging to see an outright growth in demand 
deposits which suggest the extent of development of a nation's 
financial structure. 
  However, intermediation in financial services are being 
built 
up gradually. A 1992 World Bank report cited the "lack of 
public confidence in the banking system" particularly in rural 
parts of the kingdom and the "scant earning potential for 
depositors with riel-dominated accounts". 
  It is true that savings as a percentage of GDP only notches 
a 
low eight per cent, but rural credit schemes are being evolved 
and are being custom-made for the local context. 
  On the assets side of the banking system, the NBC reports 
that credit to the private sector "recorded a sizeable decline 
from 181.94 billion riels in January to 169.4 or a decline of 
6.9 per cent." However, it urges that the decline be "viewed in 
the context of a sharp rise of 12.6 per cent witnessed in 
January 1994", and also notes that the level of credit to the 
private sector for February remains higher than that for 
December. 
  Net claims of the banking system on the public sector remain 
unchanged. However, the NBC records a 7.2 billion-riel rise in 
credit to the government which it attributes to a decline in 
"deposits of the Government with the banking system", which 
dipped to 47.5 billion riels from 55 billion riels. 
  Meanwhile, total foreign exchange assets of the banking 
system continue to rise, though not as dramatically as in the 
previous two months. February saw a 11.4 billion-riel rise for 
forex assets, to reach a total of 321.9 billion riels. 
  This is a four per cent rise and though not as high as the 
21.6 per cent and 19 per cent increase reported for previous 
months, the report concluded that "this consistent uptrend in 
assets is quite encouraging". A significant increase in forex 
assets would provide a support to import activity and structural 
adjustment of the economy. 
  Foreign exchange assets are an important indicator of the 
future health of the economy as all official reserve assets are 
either held as foreign exchange, as balances with overseas 
correspondence banks or through bilateral clearing arrangements. 
  Overall, the NBC report is confident that the banking system 
is "growing from strength to strength".

  [Text] Phnom Penh -- National Bank of Cambodia [NBC] 
reports a favourable trend in the money supply's rate of 
expansion, which has been slowing down steadily in recent months. 
  Broad money, which includes currency in circulation, demand 
deposits, time and savings deposits and foreign currency 
deposits, expanded at a rate of 13 per cent in December 1993, 
but eased off to 8.5 per cent in January of this year and 
further decelerated to 7.5 per cent in February. 
  The NBC Economic and Monetary Statistics Review for February 
1994, made available recently to The Cambodia Times, comments 
that this trend "augurs well for containing inflation". 
  Indeed, it records that the trend in the rate of inflation 
itself continues to be encouraging, noting that consumer prices 
marked only a marginal rise of 0.88 per cent in February. 
  The report reveals that February's rise would have been 
lower 
if not for the jump in energy prices. It cautions that "such a 
subdued trend in prices has to be sustained over the months, if 
inflation for the year 1994 as a whole, is to be contained 
within the 10 per cent level". 
  That, in turn, would require maintaining a disciplined 
monetary policy. The financial operations of the public sector 
and the lending operations of the banking system as well as the 
kingdom's balance of payments status and the parcelling out of 
significant aid pledges would affect such policy. 
  Currently, the NBC notes that "the share of currency in 
circulation in broad money has declined significantly from over 
58 per cent in December 1993 to about 45 per cent in February 
1994". 
  It further records that "such expansion in broad money as 
has 
taken place is wholly attributable to growth in quasi-money, 
mainly foreign currency deposits with banks". Quasi-money 
refers to time, savings and foreign currency deposits. 
  However, the public sector's financial operations have yet 
to 
determine a contractionary impact on money supply, with 
government deposits at 47.5 billion riels for February 1994 
while the banking system has net claims of 170.5 billion riels 
during the same period.

    [Editorial Report] On 27 May, REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA reports 
on page 4 the following in its business section: 
  On the halt to delivery of goods from Thailand in the wake 
of 
the burning on the Cambodian side of the Poipet border market, 
the paper says some goods from the market arrived in Phnom Penh 
on 23 and 24 May. Recently, Cambodian and Thai provincial-level 
delegations held talks on reopening the border pass, but they 
were not able to arrive at a decision. Reopening the Poipet 
market is vitally important because commodity prices in Phnom 
Penh markets have gone up exorbitantly since it closed. 
  Concerning a new 10% tax on rents collected from houses 
rented to foreigners or international organizations, the paper 
quotes an official at a Phnom Penh tax office as saying the tax 
will be implemented in early June. According to the municipal 
tax office, the reason the Finance Ministry has imposed the tax 
is, that collecting taxes on rent earned from renting houses to 
foreigners, doing business, or working in Cambodia was extremely 
difficult in the past as most landlords were unwilling to pay. 
  As for the planned exportation of Angkor beer, the daily 
quotes Jame Fong, marketing manager of the Malaysian Cambrew 
company producing and distributing Angkor beer, as saying that 
next year the company will start exporting the beer to Japan, 
other Asian countries, the United States, Australia, France, and 
Great Britain. 
  Commenting on the currency exchange market in Phnom Penh, 
the 
paper says that since the announcement of the king's departure 
on 18 May, the rate of the Cambodian currency has begun to swell 
from 2,590 to 2,600 riels a dollar. Between 22 and 25 May, $1 
could fetch as much as 2,645 riels. The precipitous decrease in 
the value of the riel, it adds, is caused by the political 
situation, which has become confused since a demonstration was 
planned to disrupt the National Assembly and since fighting 
erupted in various provinces. 
  On the expansion of Shell oil company operations, REAKSMEI 
KAMPUCHEA says the firm has spent $6 million to rent and restore 
a fuel depot in Sihanoukville. In the past few months, the 
paper continues, Shell signed with Cambodian Airlines an 
agreement on construction of a $3-million fuel depot at 
Pochentong Airport for storing aviation fuel. Shell has also 
been building service stations along all national routes.

  [Text] This morning, a Lao delegation headed by Souban 
Salitthilat, deputy foreign affairs minister, left Vientiane for 
Cairo, Egypt, to attend the 17th nonaligned ministerial 
conference from 30 May to 3 June. 
  Over the past more than 30 years, the Nonaligned Movement 
has 
firmly adhered to its principle aimed at safeguarding world 
peace, contributing to the struggle for national liberation and 
disarmament, and speaking against racial discrimination and for 
improved living conditions of people in developing countries, 
thus making it an influential political force in the 
international arena. 
  At the Cairo ministerial conference, the Movement will 
discuss various issues, including its future and program of 
action, particularly in contributing towards making the United 
Nations more democratic so it will heed the interests of all 
countries -- be they big or small, developed or underdeveloped. 
In addition, the Movement will also discuss the forthcoming 
eleventh summit, cooperation between the Nonaligned Movement and 
other international organizations, economic cooperation, human 
rights issues, the environment, and so forth.

  [Text] Vientiane, May 26 (KPL) -- Prime Minister Khamtai 
Siphandon on May 5 signed an order concerning forest 
exploitation that all state agencies at both central and 
provincial levels have to implement strictly. 
  The order indicated weak points in the implementation of the 
party and state policy on forestry resources as well as 
instances of violating this policy. 
  According to this order, permissions for cutting timber over 
quota and for cutting timber for all building purposes which 
have not been approved by the ministry concerned and the 
government are no longer issued, and those issued previously are 
ordered cancelled immediately and absolutely. No province can 
allow private businsses and owners of saw mills and wood 
processing factories to send their people to cut timber in the 
forest by themselves. State authorities in cooperation with 
locals will organise the cutting of timber and then sell it to 
private businesses at log yards No. 1 or No. 2. Provinces have 
to stop exporting log and sawn wood, and if necessary, they need 
special permission from the government. Provinces having border 
cross points with foreign countries should help the government 
in inspections. Timber export without permission from the 
governments absolutely not allowed to pass bordr points. 
  The government has allowed some companies only to do the 
export of sawn timber. Any companies with no authorization from 
the government are definitely not allowed to do so. The import 
of timber from other countries to Laos or in transit to a third 
country also requires a quota from the government. Installations 
of mobile saw mills and wood slicing machines are no longer 
allowed in the forest. Previous permissions on the matter, if 
any, will be officially cancelled. Exchanges of timber for cars, 
materials, equipment and other construction ventures are no 
longer permitted. Provinces have no right to allow local and 
foreign investors to set up wood processing industries and to 
undertake forestry concessions. This matter is to be decided by 
the government alone. The use by foreigners of labour, drawing 
equipment and trucks for cutting timber in the forest without 
permission from the government must be stopped. 
  The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of 
Industry and Handicraft are asked to send their personnel to the 
provinces to collect data on the numbers of villages and people 
still living on slash-and-burn farming on upland and watershed 
areas and their annual demand for rice. Then the personnel have 
to discuss with provincial authorities a solution to the issue. 
In areas where conditions are favorable, people may have to move 
to fixed farming in the plainland, while those living in areas 
not favorable for rice farming will be advised to stop 
slash-and-burn farming and take up the planting of industrial 
trees or cattle raising on the spot. The state will provide them 
with rice, credit, money and animals. Slash-and-burn cultivation 
in lowland areas which cause forest destruction is also strictly 
banned.

  [Text] The Department of Foreign Affairs [DFA] has issued a 
passport to former Ambassador Roberto Benedicto. Acting Foreign 
Secretary Tomas Padilla clarified, however, that the issuance of 
a passport to Benedicto does not mean he is being recognized as 
a Philippine citizen. There are reports that Benedicto is a 
Venezuelan citizen. Padilla said that once it is proven that 
Benedicto is no longer a Filipino his passport will be cancelled. 
  The DFA's decision to issue a passport to Benedicto complies 
with the Sandiganbayan's [Anti-Graft Court] order. The court 
threatened to arrest and detain Foreign Affairs Secretary 
Roberto Romulo if Benedicto was not given a passport.

  [Text] The Supreme Court has allowed the holding of the 
controversial East Timor conference at the University of the 
Philippines [UP] in Diliman, Quezon City. The high tribunal 
ordered the Quezon City Regional Trial Court to desist from 
implementing the temporary restraining order on the meeting, 
which will discuss alleged human rights violations in East Timor. 
  President Ramos directed all government agencies to 
immediately comply with the Supreme Court ruling. However, the 
government will still enforce the ban on foreign participation 
in the conference. The Immigration Bureau canceled the visas of 
foreign nationals attending the conference, but President Ramos 
removed the name of Japanese Bishop Aloisius Nobuo Soma from the 
list of 34 foreigners banned from attending the East Timor 
conference. The president's decision was announced following a 
closed-door meeting of the Cluster E which advises the president 
on political and security matters. 
  Malacanang [presidential office] was forced to say that the 
government will prevent the conference from turning into a 
political platform that would undermine the political integrity 
of Indonesia. The speeches and other public statements of the 
foreign delegates will be closely monitored, particularly those 
that would affect the national interest. 
  Twenty-five foreign delegates who were able to slip through 
a 
dragnet thrown by immigration authorities at the airport 
attended the meeting which opened yesterday. No arrests have 
been made in the UP campus as of press time. Surrounded by 
human chain of students, nuns, and priests, the foreign 
participants march inside the Diliman campus going to the 
conference site.

<F P=106> [Weekly news conference by President Fidel V. Ramos with </F>
domestic and foreign correspondents at Malacanang Palace in 
Manila -- live; passages in italics in Tagalog] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Ramos] I would like to again 
reiterate that in regard to the East Timor issue, that it was 
consistently -- in this particular case -- national interest 
that I upheld. In the same way that we have upheld national 
interest in the other contentious issues that have faced my 
government. 
  After all, what really is the definition of national 
interest? As we, at our level as national leaders understand it, 
and our other national leaders in other countries understand 
national interest. 
  I think the textbooks as well as the latest historical 
analysis of recent events will show that national interest has 
three components. 
  The first one is the preservation of the way of life, the 
core values, and the institutions of the people. Second, the 
welfare and well-being of the people of that nation. And third, 
the maintenance of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of 
the nation. These three are parts of the whole that we call 
national interest. 
  Now, in regard to the East Timor issue, as far as our way of 
life, core values, and institutions are concerned, we upheld the 
freedom of Filipinos to assemble and to express their opinions. 
Okay? 
  As far as welfare and well-being are concerned, what were 
really at stake here? Some P19 billion [Philippine pesos] worth 
of investments, projects, enterprises, and agreed partnerships 
or consortiums, divided as follows: 
  -- In the East ASEAN Growth Area, in which the southern 
Philippines is our contribution, some $250 million worth of 
investments within the next few months were at stake; and, 
  -- The rest of the Philippines, minus the southern 
Philippines, some $450 million worth of partnerships, 
investments, and projects. The most notable of which is the 
proposed Alabang in Muntinlupa to Quirino Avenue skyway in which 
the partners are the Philippine National Construction 
Corporation and Citras of Indonesia. 
  And that component is worth $450 million or a total of $700 
million, or roughly P19 billion which represents about 200,000 
jobs. 
  If we are to use 100,000 pesos as the moderate per job cost, 
as it's usually estimated by our economic managers, this is not 
the capital intensive kind of jobs and neither is it the cottage 
industry kind of jobs. This is the figure in the middle. 
  What else is involved in our welfare and well-being? Our 
peace process, especially Mindanao which has been the scene of 
bloody battles, violence, and dislocation of hundreds of 
thousands of Filipinos -- both Christians and Muslims alike. 
That, we would like to finish so that there will be a just, 
honorable, and enduring settlement for all. 
  What else is involved in welfare and well-being? ASEAN 
solidarity and cooperation which has been strengthened over the 
last 25 years since the inception of ASEAN through, precisely, 
the growing and more intimate networking of the six member 
countries. And the proof of the worth of ASEAN is simply that 
many countries now would like to join ASEAN as a subregional 
aggroupation. 
  In so far as our territorial integrity and sovereignty is 
concerned, because of Philippine-Indonesian cooperation -- and 
this started with the so-called Bali Series of Marine and Ocean 
Research and in which the Philippines has been a very active 
participant, hosting even the last one here in Manila about a 
year ago -- we have been able to bring about stabilization in 
this very contentious area of the South China Sea. And of 
course we have the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea or the 
UNCLOS, in which Indonesia and the Philippines -- as the leading 
archipelagic nations -- have been very closely cooperating. 
  And on top of all of that is that the stability within ASEAN 
has contributed significantly to the stability of the entire 
Asia and Pacific Region itself. So that's it. 
  And if you will look back at the events taking place now, 
that we have found the Solomonic solution, thanks to the support 
of everybody particularly the Supreme Court. We have in fact 
threaded the eye of the needle. The hole of that needle 
is so small. We have been searching for it for a long time but 
we found it. That is where we made our entry. Fred [one 
of the correspondents] will translate this for you since he will 
be the last speaker. [laughter from the audience] 
  And I say this in summary because we need to see these whole 
series of events in the proper context and not in the heat of 
emotion or dramatic and not balanced reporting by various 
observers, not necessarily the media. Okay? [passage omitted]

arrested by government agents. Felimon Lagman was arrested by 
Naval Intelligence agents as he drove his car on Visayas Avenue. 
Lagman is the head of Manila-Rizal Regional Party Committee,

  [Text] The country's gross national product [GNP] grew by 
4.84 percent in the first quarter of the year. That's a big 
leap compared to last year's 0.27 percent to the same period. 
Economic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito calls it a 
remarkable (?sailing). The growth rate was the highest recorded 
in the past three years. Habito said it meant new jobs for 
Filipinos and open business opportunities for local industries. 
Habito said at least 200,000 jobs would have been available 
starting last month. Habito also said prospects for the rest of 
the year are even brighter despite fears of rising prices of 
petroleum products and basic goods as a result of the 
implementation of expanded value-added tax.

  [Text] The Supreme Court yesterday acquitted the man 
charged with killing a Saudi envoy in 1989, saying that eye 
witnesses could not remember sufficient detail of the gunman's 
face to justify a conviction. 
  A third secretary of the Embassy of Saudi Arabia, Saleh 
Abdullah Al-Maliki, 35, was shot dead on 4 January 1989, in Soi 
Phipat 2, between Bangkok's North Sathon and Silom roads. Three 
bullets from a 6.35 mm pistol struck Al-Maliki in the head, 
right temple, and left ear, killing him instantly. 
  Police believed the motive for the murder was the 
dissatisfaction of employment agencies, which were losing 
commission because of Al-Maliki's method of issuing visas direct 
to Thais wanting to work in Saudi Arabia. 
  At yesterday's hearing, Judge Charan Hatthakam ruled that 
acquittal was the correct verdict because the testimony of the 
prosecutor's eye-witnesses was not deemed reliable. 
  The accused, Adinan Songkoewala, 26, was arrested on 23 June 
1989. The prosecution witnesses -- Thongkham Lengkham, Somwang 
Kritchukiat, and Lun Posayanon -- identified the accused as the 
man who shot Al-Maliki dead. They told the court that Al-Maliki 
was shot while he was walking to his residence at the PMP 
Mansion. The gunman shot Al-Maliki at close range and ran away. 
But in passing his verdict, the judge reminded the court that 
the eyewitnesses had also said they could not remember much 
detail about the gunman because they were in shock. 
  The accused had pleaded innocence, and said he had been at 
work in his garment business up-country at the time of the 
murder.

  [Text] Dr. Pricha Musikun, deputy minister of sciences, 
technology, and environment, told reporters after receiving a 
Canadian space delegation, headed by (Alan Deforest), vice 
chairman of the Canadian Space Experts Committee, that Canada 
has agreed to cooperate with Thailand on the development of 
space technology. For the initial stage, the (Spy) Company, a 
Canadian firm specializing in satellite technology, will be 
assigned to provide technical assistance and training courses 
for Thai officials. 
  Pricha disclosed that Thailand has set up a satellite 
division under the jurisdiction of the National Research 
Institute. The division is unable to cope with the work load, 
however, and thus Thailand has to depend on other countries for 
satellite information on natural resources, environment, 
forestry, and telecommunications. 
  Pricha said that Thailand needs a specific agency at the 
national level to handle satellite issues and coordinate with 
other countries. The Ministry of Sciences, Technology, and 
Environment will soon propose to the cabinet the establishment 
of a national independent satellite agency. 
  Pricha added: "In the future, it also will be necessary for 
Thailand to have its own satellite launching pad, and the most 
appropriate site is in Narathiwat Province. Canadian assistance 
in setting up a satellite data center will be useful to both 
Thailand and the neighboring countries."

  [Text] Chalat Worachat's hunger strike has sparked new 
tension between the Democrat Party and its reluctant ally 
Phalang Tham with party members exchanging heated remarks 
yesterday over a Phalang Tham member's outburst against the 
prime minister. 
  The showdown coincided with the resignation of four Phalang 
Tham MPs from the coalition whips committee. The pullout was, 
however, described as a normal procedure following Phalang 
Tham's election of a new executive committee. Newly-elected 
Phalang Tham Secretary General Udon Tantisunthon remained the 
only Phalang Tham Party member in the whips' panel. 
  On Tuesday, Chaiwat Sinsuwong, a former deputy city 
governor, 
attacked Chuan for his failure to reach a compromise with 
Chalat. "It's a shame for Thailand to have such a stupid prime 
minister," the Phalang Tham hardliner said. 
  Phalang Tham leader Bunchu Rotchanasathian described 
Chaiwat's statement as a personal opinion. But reaction from 
powerful Phalang Tham founder Chamlong Simuang appeared more 
controversial. 
  "We can't say who is right and who is wrong in this matter. 
Everybody can express his opinions," Chamlong said. 
  Government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa, a Democrat, 
charged 
that Chaiwat had bad intentions towards the both government and 
hunger striker Chalat. 
  "I don't want to see someone take advantage of Chalat's 
hunger to attack the government. It is not fair to Chalat or 
the government," Aphisit said. 
  Chuan played down the issue and said he would not raise the 
topic at the next Cabinet meeting. 
  "I haven't read (the newspapers)," the Democrat leader said. 
"Anyway, I don't think I will talk about it at the Cabinet. 
It's not that important." 
  But at a party for all coalition MPs hosted by the New 
Aspiration Party, Chuan gave a speech which was seen by many as 
an indirect message to Phalang Tham. 
  "Storms arrive every time Parliament convenes a session," 
Chuan said at the Emerald Hotel party. "I believe this time 
they are not serious. But the most important thing is for all 
of us to stick together in our ship. People assigned us to 
bring this ship in to shore and we have to do it. We must land 
on the Thai shore, not Bangladesh's. And nobody should abandon 
the ship with the intention of being the only survivor." 
  Chamlong was conspicuously absent from the party. Another 
Democrat, Deputy Finance Minister Trairong Suwannakhiri, reacted 
furiously to Chaiwat's comments. 
  Asked if he would ask Phalang Tham to reprimand Chaiwat, 
Trairong replied: "I dare not do that. Political parties 
should respect each other. I know the shoulds and should-nots 
of etiquette. I'm not that kind of low-life." 
  Democrat secretary general Sanan Khachonprasat said 
Chaiwat's 
statement was "nonsense" and added that Bunchu would take care 
of the issue. 
  Chaiwat's unexpectedly strong remark heightened wild 
speculation about Phalang Tham's possible role in Chalat's 
controversial hunger strike. Although Bunchu has tried to 
distance his party from Chalat, the activist has been strongly 
supported by party hardliners who wrested control of Phalang 
Tham's executive committee last weekend. 
  Over the past two days Chuan has implied that Chalat's 
campaign for a new Constitution had escalated into a 
collaboration of some sort with himself the ultimate target. 
Special Branch police sources backed Chuan's statement 
yesterday, saying Chalat's fast was creating circumstances which 
might lead to an eventual antigovernment crusade. 
  Chamlong has been actively trying to seek a "way out" for 
Chalat. But the Phalang Tham founder's suggestion that 
government MPs join to draft a new constitution was rejected by 
the Democrats and other coalition leaders as impractical and 
unconstitutional. 
  Pro-democracy groups, a power base for Chamlong, have closed 
ranks behind Chalat, demanding that the government abolish the 
present Constitution and promulgate a new one as called for by 
the activist. As the number of sympathizers has gradually 
swelled at the protest site in front of Parliament, so have 
fears of possible political unrest. 
  Chamlong admitted yesterday his party was trying to help 
Chalat, but added that it was also in close contact with 
coalition partners. Sources said Chamlong had also told Phalang 
Tham members not to turn their individual support for Chalat 
into a political stand of the party. 
  Chaiwat yesterday insisted that he had criticized Chuan 
because the prime minister had failed to clearly explain why the 
government could not comply with Chalat's demands. "A leader 
must defuse problems, not allow small ones to grow into big 
ones," he said. 
  The four Phalang Tham MPs who quit the coalition whips 
committee are Sarit Santimethanidon (Khon Kaen), Sutham 
Saengprathum (Nakhon Si Thammarat), Tinnawat Marnukkaphithak 
(Bangkok) and Thamrong Saengsuriyachan (Bangkok).

<F P=106> [Interview with Police General Chawalit Yotmani, secretary </F>
general of the Narcotics Control Board Office, by unidentified 
correspondent; date and place not given] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Correspondent] At the recent 
seminar in the United States on the global narcotics situation, 
what did the Asian countries say about the situation in the 
countries in the Golden Triangle? 
  [Chawalit] Thailand and the United Nations, whose UNDCP 
office is located in Thailand, talked about the problem in Laos 
and Burma. A master plan for tackling the problem in Laos is 
already completed. A plan for Burma is next, because most of 
the illicit opium cultivation is in that country. It will be 
difficult due to the political issue involving the ethnic 
monorities, which have been waging resistance against the 
Burmese Government. Some areas will not be accessible to 
control by the government. We will have to cooperate with the 
United Nations on this issue. 
  [Correspondent] How much heroin is produced annually in the 
Golden Triangle? 
  [Chawalit] It is estimated at 40-60 tons; no more than 60 
tons at most. These figures are derived from estimated 
cultivation and refining capacities. No one knows the real 
production figures. 
  [Correspondent] How much marijuana is produced in Thailand? 
  [Chawalit] It is estimated at 100-200 tons a year. There 
was a lot of cultivation in the northeast. After the 
eradication efforts were launched, however, cultivation has been 
moved to the mountains and jungles in about 20 provinces in 
various parts of the country. The growers themselves do not own 
the land where marijuana is cultivated. In this way, the 
growers hope they can better avoid detection by the police. 
  [Correspondent] The narcotics traffickers have been able to 
transport their products rather effectively. What has your 
office done to deal with this? 
  [Chawalit] It is not possible for us to inspect every 
container. Therefore, we will have to rely on good intelligence 
to inspect suspected containers. Information must come from the 
end destination. For example, we will follow up if there is 
information that a consignment is destined for a certain 
location. Several units are involved in following up such 
information, including my office, the police, the customs 
offices, and foreign units. The practice is to perform some 
inspections, but we must ensure that such inspection does not 
create unnecessary trouble for honest businessmen. [passage

  [Text] SYDNEY, June 1 (AFP) -- Australia's internal spy 
agency has replaced its telephone system, fearing it has been 
penetrated by foreign agents, it was reported Wednesday. 
  The SYDNEY MORNING HERALD, quoting intelligence sources, 
said 
the agency became concerned about its phone and computer systems 
nearly two years ago after a tip-off by the US Central 
Intelligence Agency about Russian spy activity. The newspaper 
said the decision to replace the phone and clean out the 
computer system in the Australian Security Intelligence 
Organsiation (ASIO) was linked the arrest in June 1993 of an 
ASIO agent and the secret expulsion of six Russian agents in the 
last half of 1993. The newspaper reported that the cost of 
replacing the systems would be absorbed within the extra eight 
million dollars which the ASIO received in its annual funding in 
the last Australian budget. ASIO got funding raised from 47 
million Australian dollars (31 million US) to nearly 55 million 
dollars. 
  No immediate comment could be obtained on the SYDNEY MORNING 
HERALD's report.

  [Text] Fiji's prime minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, says he is 
grateful the Australian Government has joined Fiji in bilateral 
cooperation in the Southwest Pacific. He was speaking during a 
visit to Western Australia where he was attending a handing over 
ceremony near Fremantle of the newest Pacific patrol boat to the 
Fijian Defense Forces. The boat is the 17th built in Australia 
under a project involving 11 Pacific island nations. 
  Mr. Rabuka says the patrol boat program has a direct bearing 
on endeavors to strengthen Fiji's economic security, its fight 
against illicit drugs and contraband, and protection of its 
marine resources. The Fiji prime minister says the handing over 
of the boat is a significant event in the bilateral and 
cooperative approach that Australia and Fiji are adopting in 
developing their region. Mr. Rabuka says it also symbolizes a 
firm and abiding commitment by Canberra and Suva to continue to 
build on a strong friendship based on common and mutual 
interests in the South Pacific.

  [Excerpt] Fiji's prime minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, says he's 
given a personal promise to Australia to carry out a review of 
Fiji's racially biased constitution. At talks in Canberra, 
Prime Minister Paul Keating urged Mr. Rabuka to keep up the 
momentum in favor of constitutional reform. Mr. Rabuka said he 
now believed he has earned the trust of Canberra. 
  [Begin Rabuka recording] The prime minister and the other 
ministers I spoke to this morning are greatly encouraged that we 
are moving ahead and I have given them my word that we are 
totally committed to the review. We understand that it's a very 
important issue. A lot of the problems, economic problems that 
we're now facing could be related to that and the sooner we can 
resolve the [words indistinct] the better it will be for 
everybody. [end recording] 
  Mr. Rabuka said native Fijians and Fiji's Indians would both 
have to make compromises on constitutional issues for the good 
of Fiji. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The prime minister recently issued Directive 
No.235/TTG, dated 11 May, on the need to step up all-out debt 
liquidation and debt solvency efforts in the second phase. The 
directive points out: The total amount of debts to be collected 
nationwide during the second phase will include 6,000 billion 
dong, over 200 million U.S. dollars, and nearly 10 billion 
(Japanese) yen. So far, over 70 percent of it has been listed, 
determined, and confirmed and over 500 billion dong in debt have 
been paid off. A number of localities and sectors have analyzed 
the reasons for indebtedness, dealt with a number of cases of 
breaches of stipulations on financial management and debt 
repayment by various state enterprises and other economic 
organizations. 
  However, the plan for all-out debt liquidation efforts in 
the 
second phase has been carried out very slowly. We have only 
been able to list, determine, and confirm the amount of debts. 
Up to 30 percent of of the debts listed so far have still not 
been determined and confirmed, while the majority of those that 
are have not been liquidated or dealt with. Because of a lack 
of close guidance, a number of ministries, sectors, and 
localities have adopted a wait- and-see attitude, have been 
evasive, and have not been decisive when it comes to debt 
settlement. 
  To step up debt liquidation and debt solvency and to 
conclude 
the second phase of debt liquidation within 1994 so as to 
reestablish financial order and bring back normal work 
conditions for enterprises, the prime minister hereby decides: 
  Debtor units must make full use of their existing sources of 
capital, including cash, assets, goods, real estate, equipment, 
and other valuables in their efforts to liquidate all their 
confirmed debts. These cover those owed to domestic 
enterprises, foreign debt, bank debts, and budget debts. As for 
state enterprises that are still active, their management organs 
must make them pay their debts within a set period. For 
enterprises that have already been dissolved, deactivated, or 
integrated into other enterprises, responsible organs must work 
out specific measures in accordance with the stipulations now in 
force to ensure that every enterprise concerned repays its debt. 
  From 1 July 1994 onward, the resolution of debts for 
insolvent firms must be carried out in accordance with the law 
on enterprise bankruptcy. 
  All cases of intentional delay or evasion of debt repayment 
will be liable to administrative penalties and disciplinary 
measures taken by relevant party organizations, if the debtors 
are party members. In serious cases, violators will be 
subjected to criminal liability as stipulated by the law 
regardless of their position. 
  Debt liquidation and debt solvency must be carried out in 
accordance with guidance memoranda already promulgated, 
resolutely and urgently in the following ways: 
  a. Debts already listed and confirmed among state 
enterprises that are still active must be settled immediately. 
The standing board of the Central Steering Committee for Debt 
Liquidation must guide debt liquidation and debt 
solvency-related activities in accordance with procedures 
applied in the first phase. 
  b. For debtor state enterprises already dissolved, 
deactivated, or merged with other firms, the relevant debt 
liquidation committees established to determine the property of 
these enterprises are responsible for the debt liquidation task. 
In the event the debt liquidation committees no longer exist, 
the management organ and the one who endorsed the decision to 
establish the debtor units are responsible for resolving the 
debt liquidation issue. All property and capital of debtor 
units that have already been mustered, transfered, or used for 
other purposes must be recovered for debt repayment. 
  As for debts already guaranteed by paper, in the event 
debtor 
units become insolvent, the guarantor units or individuals must 
shoulder the debt on behalf of the debtor units. 
  For enterprise management cadres who, out of their 
irresponsiblity, cause a loss of capital and property or who 
have been tempted to corruption and malfeasance while in office, 
resolute measures should be taken to force them to pay 
compensation. Depending on the severity of their offenses, they 
must be subject to criminal liability and have their assets 
seized. The debt liquidation committee of the managerial 
echelon to which a debtor state enterprise belongs must take 
measures to list the property of the debtor unit concerned for 
sale to recover money for debt liquidation purposes. The debt 
liguidation committee concerned is also authorized to confiscate 
the assets of debtor enterprises which have been dissolved, 
deactivated, or merged with other enterprises for debt 
liquidation purposes. 
  For debtor enterprises that have been dissolved, 
deactivated, 
or merged with other enterprises, in addition to inspections of 
their property and the full recovery of everything available for 
debt liquidation, we must clearly specify the collective and 
individual responsibilities of those organs that have ordered 
the founding, dissolution, or merger of these enterprises.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA June 2 -- Export earnings in the first 
six months are expected to reach USD 1.6 billion, an increase of 
27 percent compared with the same period last year, surpassed 
slightly by imports, up 33.2 per cent to USD 1.7 billion. 
  Ministry of Trade figures show that the export earning from 
crude oil are expected to reach 3.2 million tonnes, or 38 per 
cent of the yearly plan but much higher than that of the first 
six months last year, and that textile and garment products are 
expected to earn USD 150 million, up by 83 per cent compared 
with the same period last year. 
  Import activities have been concentrated on material 
catering 
for demands of home consumption and production. Petroleum 
imports are expected to reach 2.2 million tonnes (equivalent to 
51 per cent of the yearly plan), urea fertilizer 400,000 tonnes 
and steel 200,000 tonnes. Other import products such as cement, 
cotton fibre, insecticide are also higher than that of the first 
six months last year. 
  Thanks to the abundance and well circulation of goods and 
stable price, the total retail sale of goods in the market will 
reach 50 billion dong (USD 5 million), an increase of 30 per 
cent compared with the same period last year. However, there 
have been remained unsolved problems such as fake goods and tax 
evasion.... 
  The Ministry of Trade is gradually perfecting a project on 
the organization of the market to fulfil the last six months' 
objective of obtaining USD 3 billion from exports and USD 2.3 
billion from imports.

    [Editorial Report] The 7 April QUAN DOI NHAN DAN reports 
that for many years, production at the Yen Vien Oxygen Plant has 
satisfied domestic industrial and medical needs for oxygen, CO2, 
nitrogen, and calcium carbide, particularly in the north. 
Recently, the plant succeeded in producing 99.99 percent pure 
liquid nitrogen, essential for the manufacture of TV picture 
tubes and for other high-tech industrial sectors. Yen Vien is 
the only plant in the country which can produce liquid nitrogen. 
  Research and development efforts on liquid nitrogen were 
begun by the plant's own cadres and technicians in 1993, with 
the first successful test production occurring in early 1994. 
It is noteworthy that this was achieved with old Soviet 
equipment. Tests conducted using equipment from the Netherlands 
confirmed that international standards had been achieved. Thus, 
as of this year, the plant can reliably meet all domestic needs 
(including joint enterprises) for 99.7 percent pure liquid 
oxygen, 99.9 percent pure liquid nitrogen, CO2, and C2H2. 
  For the first quarter of 1994, the plant's total sales rose 
13.2 percent over the same quarter of last year. Sales of 
oxygen, the chief product, increased by 73.26 percent in the 
same period.

  [Text] The visiting foreign minister of Vietnam, Nguyen 
Manh Cam, has said that though his visit to Bangladesh was a 
brief one it has laid a new foundation in mutual relations. 
Addressing a news conference in Dhaka today, he said that long 
historical ties exists between Vietnam and Bangladesh. For a 
long time this relationship has been limited to friendship. We 
extended our support to each other's independence movement in 
different international forums. He said his current visit has 
yielded positive results. Two agreements have been signed to 
expand bilateral cooperation in economic, scientific, and 
technical spheres. He said these agreements gave a legal 
framework for future bilateral ties. Apart from meeting 
government leaders, Mr. Nguyen said he also held meetings with 
the trading community and the leaders of the Federation of 
Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 
  In reply to a question, the Vietnamese foreign minister said 
his country is keen to develop trade ties with Bangladesh. He 
said the two the countries can explore the prospects of trade 
with others together. 
  In reply to another question, Mr. Nguyen said that there has 
been an improvement in ties between Vietnam and the United 
States. In this regard, Hanoi and Washington have recently 
signed an agreement to set up liaison offices. 
  [Hong Kong AFP in English at 0956 GMT on 27 May 94 in a 
Dhaka-datelined report adds the following: "Vietnamese Foreign 
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said here Friday that Vietnam favors 
the resumption of full diplomatic relations with the United 
States as soon as possible, but that a decision is up to the 
Americans. 
  "`We are ready, but the ball is in the American court and I 
regret that I cannot say when full diplomatic ties will be 
restored between our two countries,' Cam said as he wound up a 
three-day visit to Bangladesh. 
  "Cam's comments at a press conference followed the 
announcement that Vietnam and the United States had taken 
another step toward diplomatic normalization by announcing that 
they would open liaison offices in each other's capitals. Cam 
said the only thing holding up normal diplomatic ties was US 
domestic politics, an apparent reference to pressure by American 
groups which claim Vietnam has not fully accounted for US 
servicemen still listed as missing in action from the Vietnam 
War. 
  "I am sure it will come sooner or later. Ties have improved 
since the (President Bill) Clinton administration lifted the 
economic embargo on Vietnam" in February, he said. Bangladesh 
opened a diplomatic mission in Hanoi last November. 
  "While here, Cam met President Abdur Rahman Biswas, Prime 
Minister Khaleda Zia, Foreign Minister Mustafizur Rahman and 
business leaders. The two countries pledged in two agreements 
signed Thursday to work toward improving ties. Cam said the 
pacts gave a legal framework for cooperation and his visit here 
would promote mutual understanding and trust. 
  "As for Vietnam's historic rival, China, Cam said Vietnam 
wanted a `bilateral dialogue' with Beijing to resolve 
territorial disputes on land and sea, saying `both sides should 
restrain themselves from force or the threat to use force.' 
  "Asked to comment on the US decision to renew China's 
most-favored-nation trading status, Cam said only that Vietnam 
-- one of only nine countries which does not enjoy MFN -- wanted 
it as soon as possible for itself. As for the human rights 
situation in Vietnam, Cam said the Vietnamese had regained their 
rights only after a hard struggle for independence. 
  "`We will promote them further to make a government for the 
people, of the people and controlled by the people,' he added, 
but `first comes the right to live in freedom and 
independence.'"]

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Khanh by an </F>
unidentified correspondent; place, date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondet] Dear Comrade: You just lead a 
government delegation on a visit to Syria, Egypt, and Tunisia. 
Could you please tell us the objective of the delegation's visit? 
  [Nguyen Khanh] The objective of the government delegation's 
recent visit to the Syrian Arab Republic, the Arab Republic of 
Egypt, and the Republic of Tunisia was to consolidate the 
longstanding friendship and cooperation between our country and 
these countries. It was also to thank our friends for their 
past warm support for our people's struggle for national 
independence and unification and in our current cause of 
national construction. The visit was also aimed at obtaining 
more practical results from the economic and cultural 
cooperation between our country and those friendly nations than 
in previous years when conditions were not as ripe. 
  We also called on the Palestinian state leaders at the 
Palestine Liberation Organization's headquarters in Tunis. We 
reiterated our people's unswerving support for the Arab and 
Palestinian peoples' just struggle for their basic national 
rights. 
  [Correspondent] Dear Comrade, what were the results of the 
government delegation's visit? 
  [Nguyen Khanh] The government delegation's visit to these 
three countries brought about very fine results. The leaders of 
the host countries gave us a very warm and solemn reception. 
The presidents, prime ministers, and general secretaries of the 
ruling parties of the host countries received our delegation. 
They all maintained that the Vietnamese Government delegation's 
official visit was a new indication of the solidarity and 
friendship between Vietnam and their countries. They all 
expressed the desire to broaden economic and cultural 
cooperation with Vietnam soon to coincide with Vietnam's good 
political relations with Syria, Egypt, and Tunisia. 
  During the visit, our government delegation signed trade 
agreements with the governments of Syria, Egypt, and Tunisia, 
thus creating more favorable conditions for promoting trade ties 
between Vietnam and the host countries. As we see it, there are 
very bright prospects for our country and the host countries to 
exchange goods and enter into joint ventures to manufacture 
products in which one country has an advantage. There are also 
very bright prospects for our country and the host countries to 
cooperate in culture, information, tourism, cadre training, 
archaeology, and scientific and technological research. Each of 
the host countries has famous historical relics from ancient 
civilizations in addition to such world wonders as the pyramids 
of ancient Egypt and the ancient city of Balmyra in Syria. We 
reached agreement with our friends on exchanging visits between 
business, cultural, artistic, and scientific research 
delegations in the future. 
  Thus, our visit consolidated our friendship and cooperation 
with these traditionally friendly countries and contributed to 
promoting mutual understanding as well as economic, trade, 
cultural, and scientific cooperation. 
  [Correspondent] Based on your contacts with the leaders of 
the host countries, could you please tell us about their 
impressions of our country and people? 
  [Nguyen Khanh] I think that the Syrian, Egyptian, and 
Tunisian state leaders nurture profound feelings and show great 
respect and love for Vietnam and its people. When they were 
university students, the prime ministers and other state 
officials of Syria and Egypt actively participated in the 
struggle against the wars of aggression in Vietnam. They 
praised Vietnam for its achievements and spoke highly of the 
Dien Bien Phu victory. In their words, the Vietnamese people 
deserve the respect and admiration of the whole world because we 
struggled and made sacrifices not only for Vietnam, but for all 
oppressed peoples. I also think the state leaders, government 
officials, and people of the host countries highly value the 
achievements made in Vietnam's renovation process. They are all 
hopeful that Vietnam can make quick progress in every field and 
become an economically and culturally developed country within 
Southeast Asia. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you comrade.

  [Text] German Cooperation and Development Minister Mr. 
Carl-Dieter Spranger has concluded a working visit to Vietnam. 
Following is our radio comment: 
  A joint press conference was held in Hanoi by Chairman of 
the 
State Planning Committee Mr. Dau Ngoc Xuan and German Minister 
Carl-Dieter Spranger. The two ministers voiced their countries' 
will to strengthen relations and cooperation in many fields 
between the two countries in accordance with the potential of 
each country. The German minister also briefed on the outcome 
of his working visit to Vietnam. He said that Vietnam and 
Germany have achieved positive progress in political, trade, and 
economic areas. Over the past two years, high-level delegations 
of both sides have exchanged visits. The most important has been 
the visit to Germany by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet at 
the end of June last year and the visit by Vice Chancellor and 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to Vietnam in April last year. 
The nomination of a special envoy in charge of relations 
between Germany and Vietnam at the German Embassy was an 
illustration of Germany's evaluation of the political importance 
of Vietnam. The decision was in conformity with Germany's 
foreign policy to broaden relations with Asia, the most 
promising region in the world. 
  Commercial activities and investment between the two 
countries have also increased. In 1992, the total trade 
turnover between the two countries was more than 440 million 
Deutch marks and this year this figure might double. At 
present, Germany has invested in nine projects with a total 
capital of 13 million Deutsche marks. However, German 
businessmen and the German media think that the economic ties 
between the two countries are not big enough in both scope and 
scale in comparison with Vietnam's expectations and present 
conditions, as well as Germany's economy. The German business 
newspaper (HEINDORF PRESSE) commented that German business 
circles were following with keen interest developments in 
Vietnam and held that the process of renovation in Vietnam has 
achieved positive outcome. Vietnam has a skilled labor force 
with its industry and intelligence. Another favorable condition 
for German businessmen was that Vietnam has 5,000 people who 
studied and graduated in Germany and about 100,000 people who 
work in Germany. It means that in Vietnam, the number of those 
who speak German is higher than in any other Southeast Asian 
country. These are factors for further development of relations 
between Vietnam and Germany.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
and the South Korean puppets staged a joint air war exercise to 
examine the capacity of a surprise strike on the North in the 
skies above Pyongchang, Hoengsong and Asan bay, South Korea, on 
May 26, military sources said. 
  It involved many overseas-based U.S. warplanes and 
fighter-bombers, assault planes, observation planes, 
reconnaissance planes and early warning planes belonging to the 
U.S. Airforce in South Korea and the puppet Airforce. 
  Meanwhile, 105-mm artillery groups and bandits of the puppet 
army took combat positions in Paju and Yonchon Counties, Kyonggi 
Province, and Chorwon County, South Korean Kangwon Province, and 
fired more than 300 shells and bullets of large-caliber 
machineguns at spots adjacent to the Demilitarized Zone along 
the Military Demarcation Line.

  [Text] According to military sources, the U.S. imperialists 
on 27 May perpetrated a provocative aerial war exercise aimed at 
northward invasion. 
  Prior to this, pursuit-assault planes, vertical take-off and 
landing attack planes, and electronic jamming planes flew in 
from the U.S. bases in the Pacific region to the U.S. Air Force 
stationed in South Korea. The overseas-based flying corps were 
mobilized in the skies above Yongwol, Yangpyong, and Umsong on 
this day and were frenzied in the aerial war exercise aimed at 
northward invasion in cooperation with fighter planes of the 
U.S. Air Force stationed in South Korea. 
  In the war exercise staged amid electronic jamming under the 
command of EA-6, the flying corps from overseas bases and 
fighter-bombers, attack planes, observation planes, and 
reconnaissance planes of the U.S. Air Force stationed in South 
Korea were mobilized on a large-scale. 
  The war exercise was a reckless play with fire aimed at 
increasing their capabilities of making a surprise attack on the 
North and at enhancing cooperation between overseas-based flying 
corps and military planes of the U.S. Air Force stationed in 
South Korea. This is a clear proof that the U.S. imperialists 
are the ones who increase tension on the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- U.S. Congresswoman 
Elizabeth Purse demanded a switchover in the Korea policy of the 
U.S. 
  In her letter of April 8 to the U.S. President and to the 
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, she expressed 
concern over U.S. armed threat to North Korea. 
  No one says North Korea is producing nuclear fissionable 
materials, but the United States alone insists on that 
possibility, she said. 
  War preparations against North Korea do not conform to the 
supreme interests of the United States, she said, adding that 
she thinks the United States must not escalate tensions but 
pursue a policy for normalising relations with North Korea. 
  "Under the current situation," she said, "we must continue 
to 
use diplomatic means and improve relations with North Korea."

  [Text] A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea [DPRK] issued a statement 
on 1 June refuting the UN Security Council [UNSC] president's 
statement of unreasonable allegations of finding fault with us, 
which was released a few days ago. 
  Press statement of a spokesman of the DPRK Foreign Ministry: 
  The UN Security Council, on May 30, according to a scenario 
which had been worked out in advance by some member states, 
published a statement of its president groundlessly finding 
fault with us and containing the unreasonable claim that the 
fuel rods must be replaced only in compliance with the practical 
demands of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and 
that the opportunity for selecting fuel rods for separation and 
preservation might be lost. 
  It is entirely unjust for the UN Security Council to have 
discussed our question without any justifiable reason on the 
basis of the wrong judgment made by the Secretariat of the IAEA. 
It was only a few days ago that negotiations on the replacement 
of fuel rods of the 5 megawatt experimental atomic power station 
were held between us and the agency. 
  The main question discussed at the negotiations was the 
preservation of technical possibilities of future measurement of 
replaced fuel rods and, in particular, there was sufficient 
debate on the reasonableness of the method we are applying at 
present. 
  The agency side, too, said it would seriously study our 
method and the two sides agreed to continue to discuss it in 
future negotiations. 
  And it was confirmed that none of the fuel rods being 
replaced were diverted for other purposes and, practically, that 
the whole course of the current replacement of fuel rods is 
going on in the presence of agency inspectors and under strict 
control of inspection equipment. 
  By the way, what justification on earth does the UN Security 
Council have to put our question on its agenda and discuss it 
now. 
  If things were to take a correct track, the UN Security 
Council should have called, not us, but some quarters of the 
agency secretariat, into question. 
  Before starting to replace fuel rods, on several occasions, 
we requested that the agency take necessary measures such as its 
presence and the removal of the seals. But it did not send a 
team of inspectors to the end, when the replacement of fuel rods 
began, thus openly neglecting its duty as an international 
organization. This was what some quarters of the IAEA 
Secretariat did. 
  Even when we allowed "an additional inspection" which 
alluded 
to "an inspection left incomplete," they shunned it, thus 
intentionally ignoring the statement of the president of the UN 
Security Council dated March 31. 
  It was also the agency's Secretariat that distorted the fact 
by talking as if the negotiations had broken down and hurriedly 
referred our problem to the UN Security Council without a clear 
explanation, categorically denying our method even before the 
negotiating delegation of the agency, which had promised to 
study the method, arrived at the head office in Vienna. 
  In all, such an act by the Secretariat of the IAEA was aimed 
at capping us ultimately with the title of culprit [pigo] by 
justifying their past behavior in concocting, by any means, 
"inconsistency" against us on the basis of fabricated 
information. 
  It is only too natural that our country, which has engaged 
itself only in peaceful nuclear activities as a dignified, 
independent, sovereign state, will not yield to such 
unreasonable act of the agency's Secretariat and allow itself to 
be treated as an offender [choein]. 
  In view of this, the UN Security Council, instead of finding 
fault with us, should have taken issue with some officials of 
the IAEA Secretariat who laid hurdles in the way of our peaceful 
nuclear activities, framed sinister political intrigue to shift 
the blame on to us and referred the problem to the UN. 
  It is also self-contradictory that the presidential 
statement 
of the UN Security Council unreasonably urged us to allow 
selected separation and preservation of fuel rods and 
preservation of the possibility of future measurement. 
  Since we are in a unique status after the temporary 
suspension of the effectuation of our declared withdrawal from 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, it is clear that we cannot 
accept such routine and ad hoc inspection as the selected 
preservation of fuel rods. A full understanding of this was 
reached at the recent negotiations with the agency. 
  Although we are replacing the fuel rods in a unique status, 
we are doing the utmost to show the transparency of our nuclear 
activities. 
  The replacement of fuel rods is taking place in such a way 
as 
to fully preserve the technical possibility of measuring the 
fuel rods in the future as requested by the agency when our 
unique status comes to an end. 
  This is the most scientific and realistic method invented by 
our scientists and facility operators with a high sense of 
cooperation, motivated by their consistent position to show the 
uprightness of the nuclear activities. Its feasibility has 
already been proven fully through experiments. 
  If this method of our style is applied, it will be possible 
to reproduce the channel and order of any fuel rods and measure 
them correctly in the future. 
  At the recent negotiations in Pyongyang, we gave the IAEA 
side a full explanation of our-style method concerning the 
replacement of fuel rods and suggested with a good intention 
that negotiations should be held any time if there were any more 
questions to be discussed. 
  There have been attempts these days to create the "urgency" 
of the situation by alleging that the pace of the replacement of 
fuel rods is too fast. Since it is part of the pure peaceful 
nuclear activities and technical possibilities for ensuring the 
continuity of safeguards and measuring fuel rods in the future 
are fully guaranteed, there is no ground for finding fault with 
the speed of replacing fuel rods. 
  It was necessary to test the maximum efficiency of the 
refueling machine that our replacement of fuel rods progressed 
at a rather fast speed some time ago. This was also a normal 
course of the peaceful nuclear activities. So, this is hardly a 
matter for surprise. 
  Such being the case, at a time when everything is 
progressing 
smoothly on a normal track, the UN Security Council discussed 
the biased report submitted by some officials of the Secretariat 
of the agency without any examination and hurriedly adopted a 
presidential statement. It is hardly understandable. 
  This was because they were too dull to sense the reality or 
they were affected by some sinister political background. 
  If the UN Security Council, for this matter, is 
disgracefully 
charged with being manipulated by some specified member nations 
while ignoring its noble mission to be responsible for world 
peace and security, it will be a shame to history. 
  Originally, the basis for the existence of an international 
organization is impartiality. 
  If the IAEA Secretariat and the UN Security Council, bereft 
of impartiality, continue to insist on pressure with an 
unreasonable attitude, we will not feel any need to be 
restricted by such pressure, either. 
  It is intolerable that we have suffered from big obstacles 
in 
our peaceful nuclear activities, restricted by the unilateral 
demand of the IAEA. In case pressure is put on us again, we 
will no longer fall victim to the unreasonable demand but will 
have to go our own way, unhindered by anything. 
  This is our firm will, who regard independence as our life 
and blood. 
  If some officials of the IAEA Secretariat declare that the 
technical possibilities of the future measurement of fuel rods 
are gone or the UN Security Council puts pressure on us, talking 
about sanctions under that pretext, we cannot but take the 
course of taking decisive countermeasures, freeing ourselves 
from such unreasonable restrictions rather than suffering from 
them, and we will be left with no other choice but to go over to 
the continuous process of the peaceful nuclear activities. We 
will respond any time with utmost sincerity to the intention to 
solve the issue in a fair way and resolve it in a peaceful way 
through dialogue. But we will counter without slightest 
compromise even the slightest intention to ignore our 
sovereignty by unjustifiably putting pressure on us.

of Fuel Rods Refuted"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- The United Nations 
Security Council, on May 30, according to a scenario which had 
been worked out by some member states, published a statement of 
its president groundlessly slandering the DPRK and containing 
the unreasonable claim that the fuel rods must be replaced 
strictly in compliance with the practical demands of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the opportunity of 
selected separation and preservation of fuel rods might be lost. 
  This is entirely wrong for the security council, said a 
spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea in a statement published on June 1. 
  If things were to take a correct track, the security council 
should have called in question not the DPRK, but some quarters 
of the agency secretariat, the spokesman said, and went on: 
  Before starting refueling, we had requested the agency 
several times to take necessary measures such as its presence 
and the removal of the seals. But it failed to send a group of 
inspectors till refueling began, thus openly neglecting its duty 
as an international organisation. This was what some quarters

intention to deal with the issue in a fair way and resolve it in 
a peaceful way through dialogue. But we will counter without 
slightest compromise any intention to unjustifiably put pressure 
on us, ignoring our sovereignty, if but a little.

<F P=106> ["Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam Sends </F>
Letter to UN Secretary General Over Establishment of New Peace 
Arrangement" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- Vice-Premier and Foreign 
Minister Kim Yong-nam sent a letter to UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali on May 28 regarding an important measure 
taken by the DPRK Government recently to establish a new peace 
arrangement on the Korean peninsula. 
  Recalling that the DPRK Government, through a statement of 
the Foreign Ministry April 28, proposed to the United States to 
hold negotiations to establish a new peace arrangement that 
would replace the old armistice mechanism, the letter says: 
  As you confirmed personally during your visit to our country 
toward the end of last year, an unstable state of truce, neither 
peace nor war, has lasted for more than 40 years on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The situation on the Korean peninsula has become all the 
more 
strained and the possibility of a total armed conflict is 
increasing because the United States, entering this year, has 
massed huge reinforcements in and around South Korea and stepped 
up its military actions against the DPRK on the pretext of the 
"nuclear issue". 
  The Korean Armistice Agreement and its observation mechanism 
should have controlled such actions, but they have failed to 
play any role due to the U.S. side's systematic acts of breach 
and destruction. 
  In 1956 the United States expelled Neutral Nations 
Inspection 
teams stationed at the appropriate ports of entry under 
Paragraph C, Article 2 of the Korean Armistice Agreement from 
the area under its control and, on June 21, 1957, it 
unilaterally renounced Subparagraph 13d of the Korean Armistice 
Agreement which stipulates that the introduction into Korea of 
reinforcing combat equipment shall be ceased. Since then the 
United States has shipped sophisticated weapons including more 
than 1,000 pieces of nuclear weapons into South Korea without 
any restrictions and it has become all the more undisguised of 
late in its shipments of such combat equipment. 
  Having systematically destroyed the military armistice 
mechanism, the U.S. side completely paralyzed it by unilaterally 
appointing as the senior member of the "UN Forces" side to the 
Military Armistice Commission (MAC) a South Korean serviceman 
without any legal justification or qualification in view of the 
Armistice Agreement on March 25, 1991. 
  The present-day reality in which the basic provisions of the 
Armistice Agreement that should guarantee peace on the Korean 
peninsula have been scrapped and the armistice observation 
mechanism now remains only in name requires that a decisive 
measure be taken to establish a new security arrangement for 
saving the situation which has reached the danger line and 
preventing arms buildup and the outbreak of another war. 
  In fact, the Korean Armistice Agreement signed on July 27, 
1953, was a tentative measure taken to stop combat actions 
between the belligerent parties and taken in anticipation of its 
conversion to a peace agreement in the future. 
  The adoption of the resolution (3390, b) calling for the 
dissolution of the "UN command" and the replacement of the 
Armistice Agreement by a peace agreement at the 30th session of 
the UN General Assembly in 1975, therefore, was a very just 
measure to ensure a lasting peace on the Korean peninsula and it 
opened a bright vista for the final solution of the Korean 
question. 
  The DPRK Government has taken initiatives and proposed 
negotiations on many occasions to ensure a durable peace on the 
Korean peninsula and made tireless efforts to carry them into 
effect. Nonaggression was vowed by the North and the South 
through the "agreement on reconciliation, nonaggression, 
cooperation and exchange between the North and the South" 
adopted in 1992 as a result of our positive efforts. But we are 
still in a state of truce vis-a-vis the United States which 
keeps its Armed Forces stationed in South Korea. 
  The "UN command", known as a signatory to the Armistice 
Agreement, serves for the strategic aim of the United States to 
isolate and stifle the DPRK and establish control over Asia and 
the Pacific region, an aim which has nothing to do with the UN 
mission to keep peace in South Korea. I think, therefore, that 
there is no condition for the U.S. Forces present in South Korea 
to act "UN Forces" any longer. [sentence as received] 
  Taking into consideration the actual conditions where a 
grave 
situation threatening peace had been created on the Korean 
peninsula but there was no rational institutional mechanism 
capable of controling it, the DPRK Government proposed to the 
U.S. side to negotiate the establishment of a new durable peace 
arrangement that will replace the old armistice mechanism and, 
at the same time, took practical measures of recalling all the 
members of the Korean People's Army (KPA) side from the MAC, 
setting up the KPA mission at Panmunjom as a new mechanism for 
negotiations with the U.S. Forces side and of appointing the 
chief and members of the mission. 
  This is, to all intents and purposes, an innovative and 
well- 
intentioned step to make a breakthrough in establishing a new 
security arrangement for peace on the Korean peninsula and a 
peaceloving step that took into account the publicly accepted 
international usage whereby some countries abandoned the 
relationship of hostilities after the Second World War and 
declared peace relationship instead. 
  I consider that the United Nations must pay due attention to 
our proposal in the sense of liquidating its unpleasant past 
vis-a-vis the DPRK, its member state, and in the sense of 
fulfilling its resolution to replace the Armistice Agreement 
with a peace agreement. 
  The "nuclear issue" over which some countries are now making 
a fuss is, in fact, not a question to be discussed by the United 
Nations, but one that must be solved through negotiations 
between the DPRK and the U.S. 
  Taking "sanctions" against the DPRK, yielding to the unjust 
demand of some countries, it will, no doubt, bring devastating 
consequences menacing peace in Asia and the rest of the world, 
not to speak of the Korean peninsula. 
  With a view to accelerating the process of the replacement 
of 
the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement in accordance 
with the resolution of the 30th General Assembly, the United 
Nations must take a practical step to dismantle the "UN 
command", the framework of the old armistice structure. 
  In the letter Kim Yong-nam expresses the hope that the UN 
secretary-general will pay a particular attention to the peace 
overture of the DPRK to establish a new peace arrangement 
through the medium of the DPRK-U.S. negotiations and actively 
cooperate in its materialisation.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- Chairwoman of the C.C. 
[Central Committee], the Chondoist Chongu Party Yu Mi-yong in a 
statement Wednesday urged the political parties and religious 
organizations of South Korea to accede to a contact at an 
earlier date to discuss the convocation of a national conference. 
  She said the choice of the entire fellow countrymen for 
warding off the danger of a nuclear war hanging over the nation, 
defending peace of the country and opening a signal phase for 
the independent and peaceful reunification of the country is the 
great unity of the whole nation and the convocation of a 
national conference that may help pool the patriotic will and 
efforts of the nation. 
  "We Chondoist believers cannot give up our hope for a 
national conference although a tiny handful of those in South 
Korea opposed to dialogue and reunification are laying hurdles 
in our way," she said, and added: "We urge that our Chondoist 
Chongu Party and political parties of South Korea should have 
bilateral or multilateral contacts at an early date to discuss 
the convocation of a national conference." 
  She expressed the hope that the South Korean authorities, 
though belatedly, would show a positive response to the proposal 
for ont vocation of a national conference and take due measures 
to select promptly South side's delegates to the preparatory 
committee for a national conference so that the committee might 
tackle down to its task.

  [Text] Moscow, May 30 (KCNA) -- V. Tolstsikov, chairman of 
the Central Council of the Russian Association for Friendship 
and Cultural Cooperation with the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea, sent a letter on May 26 to Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin concerning Kim Yong-sam's trip to Moscow slated for 
early June. 
  In the letter dated May 25 he said it was made known through 
publications recently that Yeltsin would meet Kim Yong-sam of 
South Korea and discuss "North Korea's nuclear issue" with him. 
Judging from the recent foreign trips of the South Korean big 
shot, he said, one can guess easily that one of the basic aims 
to be sought by him in his forthcoming visit to Russia is to 
discuss this issue. 
  Noting that this South Korean has been peddling the fake 
ware 
of "North Korea's nuclear issue", he said this is, in essence, 
aimed at slandering the DPRK, impairing its prestige and, 
furthermore, at stifling and destroying it as their masters 
across the ocean are seeking to do so. 
  The DPRK is an independent state and an ally of Russia, he 
stressed, asking Yeltsin not to do acts of distressing the DPRK, 
a state which has been friendly to Russia for scores of years.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam group 
made "a sweeping search" of the South Korean Federation of 
General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon) and launched a wholesale 
arrest of core leaders on charges of "open pro-North, 
pro-communist tendencies" and "violation of the National 
Security Law." 
  Papers here today brand it as a premeditated fascist 
offensive to suppress and strangle Hanchongnyon, the patriotic 
vanguard organisation of the South Korean students. 
  An analyst of NODONG SINMUN says: 
  The fascist clique is brandishing the sword at Hanchongnyon, 
labeling it as a "pro-communist, enemy-benefiting organisation". 
But this is an illegal fascist action which can never be 
justified. 
  The criminal Kim Yong-sam group's suppression of the 
righteous- minded students who did praise-worthy things for the 
nation is a violence of fascist hooligans who have lost the last 
shred of national conscience and human reason. 
  It is an unjustifiable anti-national crime for the puppets 
to 
invoke the "National Security Law" against South Korean students 
for the mere reason that they refuse obedience to the 
reactionary rule and advocate patriotism and justice. 
  It is crystal clear that "democracy" and "civilian politics" 
advertised by the Kim Yong-sam group is a camouflage to conceal 
its true color as civilian fascists and the group is seeking a 
way out in crackdown on the just struggle of the students and 
people. 
  A MINJU CHOSON analyst says: 
  The Kim Yong-sam group must scrap the anti-democratic, anti- 
reunification "National Security Law" and immediately stop the 
suppression of Hanchongnyon and students.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- Rallies of workers were 
held at factories in Pyongyang supporting and encouraging the 
struggle of the South Korean workers for wage hike. 
  The speakers at the rallies said that the South Korean 
workers were paid less than one fourth of the minimum living 
cost for their intensive labour of longest working hour in the 
world. But the Kim Yong-sam group is pursuing even the 
wage-curbing policy under the pretext of "share of pains", they 
noted. 
  Charging that the South Korean puppet clique issued an order 
to brand the struggle of the workers for wage hike and 
"labour-management dispute" as illegal to severely counter 
them and mobilised all the repressive forces to crack down on 
them at the point of bayonet, they said: 
  "If the South Korean workers vacillate in the present-day 
struggle or pin any illusion and expectation on the authorities 
and enterpreneurs, it will result in binding them faster to the 
chains of oppression and capital," the speakers said, and 
stressed: 
  The South Korean workers must give a teaching to the 
exploiters in concerted efforts. 
  The South Korean workers must wage a vigorous struggle to 
get 
U.S. imperialist forces of aggression withdrawn from South 
Korea, abolish the fascist laws and repressive tools, let the 
present "civilian" government resign and establish a genuine 
independent government. 
  The working class in the northern palf of Korea will achieve 
the reunification of the country without fail by pooling efforts 
with the South Korean workers.

<F P=106> ["Japan's Crimes in Aggression Can Never be Pardoned" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today 
points out that the Japanese authorities and reactionaries are 
stepping up the moves to revive militarism and convert Japan 
into a military power while refusing to admit Japan's past 
crimes. 
  This was made clear when Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata 
said recently at the Budget Committee of the House of 
Representatives that he had no intention to define the war waged 
by Japan against Asian nations in the past as "a war of 
aggression" and Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito 
brought forward the doctrine of "ordinary state", the analyst 
says, and continues: 
  Immeasurable are the misfortunes and disasters imposed on 
the 
Korean and other Asian peoples by the Japanese imperialists' war 
of aggression and their policy of colonial looting. 
Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities and reactionaries 
refuse to properly admit Japan's past crimes. This well shows 
how shameless they are. 
  Just voices demanding the liquidation of the Japanese 
imperialists' past doings are growing louder not only among the 
Asian people but also among the world people. The Japanese 
authorities and reactionaries, far from lending an ear to their 
just demand and honestly responding to it, are now racing 
headlong toward the conversion of Japan into a military power, 
denying that the war started by Japan was "a war of aggression." 
Yet the Japanese authorities are coveting a permanent seat of 
the United Nations Security Council. 
  The acts of the Japanese authorities and reactionaries can 
never be tolerated. 
  The Japanese authorities should act with discretion, mindful 
that their acts are an intolerable challenge to the people in 
Asia and the rest of the world.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- Korean residents in 
Japan and Japanese people bitterly denounced the Japanese 
Government's smear campaign against the DPRK and suppression of 
the General Association of Korean residents in Japan (Chongnyon). 
  So Man-sol, vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee 
of Chongnyon, in a talk with compatriots of the Fukuyama branch 
of Chongnyon in Hiroshima prefecture on May 18 said the ulterior 
intention of the unreasonable search of the Osaka prefectural 
organisation of Chongnyon by Japanese police on the pretext of 
"forcible obstruction to business" was to destroy the 
organisation and activity of Chongnyon. 
  Kim Hwa-hyo, vice-chairman of the Association of Korean 
Social Scientists in Japan, in a lecture on May 14 branded the 
police search as a deliberate and premeditated political 
repression. 
  Koreans under the Hyogo, Nara and Wakayama prefectural 
headquarters of Chongnyon, representatives of the Gifu and Mie 
prefectural headquarters of the League of Korean Youth in Japan 
and teachers and students of the Tohoku Korean Primary, Junior

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 31 (KCNA) -- Japanese authorities' 
suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon) has come under fire in different countries. 
The Mozambican Committee for Friendship With the People of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a statement May 20 said 
the Japanese reactionaries have perpetrated a vicious 
anti-Chongnyon campaign, while scheming to hurl their Armed 
Forces into the Korean peninsula by drawing up a "security 
emergency legislative arrangement", but they are greatly 
mistaken. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must correctly understand the 
socialist Korea, the statement stressed, and added: If they do 
not stop at once their reckless anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon 
campaign, they will bump into curses and condemnations from the 
Korean people and the world people. 
  The Nepal-Korea Friendship Association in a statement May 20 
said the police search of the Osaka prefectural headquarters of 
Chongnyon by the Japanese authorities was part of their 
political intrigues to suppress Chongnyon and a crude violation 
of the democratic national rights of the Korean citizens in 
Japan. 
  The Nigeria-DPRK Friendship Association in a statement May 
17 
strongly urged the Japanese authorities to renounce the hostile 
policy towards the DPRK and stop at once the suppression of 
Chongnyon and apologize for it.

and implement the "10-point Programme of the Great Unity of the 
Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country" have been 
conducted vigorously within the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), an authoritative organization of 
overseas citizens of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,

meeting of the Korean residents in Japan. 
  It was stressed in unison at the meetings that the 10-point 
programme of the great unity of the whole nation is a common 
reunification charter of the nation and a great political 
programme which makes it possible to tide over the present 
rigorous difficulties and achieve peace and reunification of the 
country by the united efforts of the whole nation. 
  Rallies, study meetings, lectures and seminars were held 
widely by organizations of Chongnyon and 4,173 cases of mass

<F P=106> ["A Country Where Power Is in the Hands of Popular Masses" </F>
-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA)--Hardial Bainz, national 
leader of the Communist Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist), in 
his memoirs on the looks of the re-built Korea, which was 
published in a recent issue of the Canadian paper TODAY AND 
TOMORROW, said during his stay in the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea, he could see at first hand the Korean people 
shaping their own destinies by their devoted efforts, and 
realized that Korea is, indeed, a country where the power is 
entirely in the hands of the popular masses and which was built 
by the people for themselves. 
  The memoir says the United States that provoked an 
aggressive 
war and destroyed everything in Korea in order to block the 
victorious advance of communism after the Second World War, 
blared that Korea would be unable to recover even in 100 years, 
but Korea completed the reconstruction in a short span of time 
and has now set an example of human efforts and creation. 
  The author wrote that through the visit to Korea, he knew 
that Korea has a mysterious strength capable of smashing 
imperialism and that strength is the singlehearted unity of the 
Korean people who are struggling for the national reunification, 
firmly rallied behind the party and the leader. 
  The Nepalese paper DRISTI quoted the former director of the 
Organizational Department of the C.C. [Central Committee], the 
Nepal Communist Party (United Marxism-Leninism), Jeev Raj 
Ashrit, as saying in his impressions of Korea that the entire 
Korean people are feeling satisfied with and proud of the 
socialist life they enjoy and striving to realize the national 
reunification independently and peacefully.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 1 (KCNA) -- A social science seminar 
took place here on May 31 to mark the 55th anniversary of the 
great leader President Kim Il-song's historical advance into the 
Musan area. 
  President Kim Il-song dealt a heavy military and political 
blow to the Japanese imperialist aggressors in the operation of 
advance into Musan area in May 1939 and advanced into the area 
again in June of that year, personally leading members of the 
main unit of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army. That was 
great events which occasioned an epoch-making turn in bringing 
about an uninterrupted upsurge in the Korean revolution as a 
whole centering around the anti-Japanese armed struggle and 
accelerating the cause of national liberation in reliance upon 
the strength of the Korean people. 
  The speakers said the historic advance of the great leader 
was an important occasion in building the area northeast of Mt. 
Paektu and the northern frontier of Korea along the Tumen River 
into a strategic base for a constant upsurge in the Korean 
revolution as a whole and rousing broad segments of the people 
in the preparations for an all-people resistance. 
  The historic advance opened up a new phase in calling the 
whole nation to the anti-Japanese national struggle, they noted, 
adding that the advance encouraged all the Korean people to turn 
out in the great anti-Japanese war, so that the fierce flames of 
the anti-Japanese armed struggle might sweep the whole country.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
carries an article by Yi Yong-tok, vice-chairman of the Central 
Committee of the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea 
[LSWYK], under the headline "Strengthening Education of Youth 
and Children is Consistent Policy of Our Party." 
  The article says: 
  The lifeline of the revolution is maintained by the new 
generation and the destiny of the country is decided by it. The 
destiny of the party and the revolution largely depends on the 
education of the youth and children, the new generation. 
  From early days the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] has paid 
deep attention to firmly training the new generation, attaching 
importance to the education of the youth and children. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il indicated the road of 
the movement of the Korean youth and children conforming to the 
development of the revolution at the stage where the cause of 
modeling the whole society on the chuche idea is being realized 
and powerfully organizations of the WPK, the LSWYK and the 
childrens' union to follow this road. 
  The question of the education of the youth and children has 
been successfully solved in Korea under the wise guidance of the 
party. 
  The 8 million youths and children are demonstrating their 
stout spirits and noble traits as the dependable successors to 
the revolution and living and striving with the resolution to 
lay down their lives as rifles and bombs in case of emergency. 
This clearly proves the vitality of our party's policy of 
education of the youth and children. 
  To strengthen ideological education among the youth and 
children is an urgent demand of our developing revolution and 
the obtaining [word as received] situation. 
  The imperialists and reactionaries of the world are getting 
more desperate in their maneuvers to isolate and stifle the 
DPRK, the socialist fortress. They are trying to disarm the 
youth and children ideologically in executing their 
anti-socialist strategy. 
  The historical experiences and lessons of the socialist 
movement teach us that the destiny of the socialist cause 
largely depends on the ideological education of the new 
generation. 
  Only when we better educate the young men and women, the 
most 
active and influential unit of the society, and the school 
children, the future of the motherland, can we firmly defend 
Korean-style socialism and successfully carry forward the 
revolutionary cause of chuche to accomplishment. 
  The vice-chairman elaborates on important questions arising 
in the education of the youth and children in the present times 
such as education in revolutionary tradition, class education 
and socialist patriotic education.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 1 (KCNA) -- Officials and workers of 
factories under the State Light Industry Commission of Korea 
have turned out as one in implementing the light industry-first 
policy of the Workers' Party of Korea, effecting a steady 
upsurge in production. 
  More than 30 factories including the Pyongyang Textile 
Combine, the Sinuiju Export Garment Factory, the Hyesan 
Shoe-Making Factory and the Pyongyang Textile Machine Factory 
fulfilled their may plan ahead of schedule. 
  The Anju and Palwon Silk Mills had topped their monthly 
quotas 70 percent in industrial output value and 10 percent in 
production indices by May 27 by introducing valuable technical 
innovation proposals in production. 
  The Tongdaewon Garment Factory, the Kyongamsan Export 
Garment 
Factory and other factories and enterprises under the Unha 
Associated Trading Bureau hit their monthly exports production 
targets more than five days ahead of schedule. 
  Shoe-making factories in Sariwon, Hyesan, Pyongyang and 
other 
areas produced more shoes in May than the previous month.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Vice Finance Minister Jiro 
Saito said Thursday [2 June] he hopes to see "some progress" in 
the ongoing insurance talks under the resumed U.S.-Japan 
"framework" trade talks. 
  But Saito, speaking at a regular press meeting, declined to 
elaborate, saying negotiations are still under way and he has 
not yet heard full details. 
  Japanese and U.S. negotiators are meeting in Tokyo for the 
second day of the two-day talks that are expected to end later 
this evening. 
  Insurance business is one of the three priority areas along 
with automobiles and auto parts, and government procurement of 
telecommunications and medical equipment.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
reported progress in revived trade talks on Thursday [2 June] 
but said they remain apart on key issues in the insurance sector 
negotiations. 
  "The mood was not that the two sides are in dispute" in the 
two-day insurance talks in Tokyo, said a senior Japanese Finance 
Ministry official. "Both sides appear to favor a quick 
settlement." 
  A U.S. trade official called the talks "successful meetings, 
but just one step in what are going to be difficult 
negotiations." 
  "We obviously still have considerable work ahead of us 
before 
we complete our agreement," he said. "We are anxious to 
conclude these negotiations as quickly as possible." 
  No deadline has been set for the insurance sector, but the 
official said the two sides were "adjusting their schedules" to 
finish before a July summit of major industrial nations. 
  They agreed to start drafting an accord when they meet again 
late this month, but they have yet to delve in detail on the 
sticky issue of "objective criteria" to gauge progress in 
opening Japan's markets, he said. 
  Most of the meetings consisted of catching up on events 
since 
bilateral trade "framework" talks broke down in February and on 
confirming the progress they made before the rupture, said the 
Japanese and U.S. officials separately, each declining to be 
named. 
  Negotiators were halfway to agreement when talks broke down 
over other sectors and neither side is making new demands, the 
Japanese official said. 
  But serious differences remain, with the U.S. continuing to 
press for what the U.S. official called its most important issue 
-- deregulation of prices, terms and conditions of insurance 
policies in Japan. 
  Washington insists that Japan allow competition in prices 
and 
innovative policies in the life and nonlife sectors, saying 
Japanese consumers have essentially no choice in either area, 
the U.S. official said. 
  Negotiators have not attempted to define objective criteria 
to measure progress in opening Japan's market, as called for in 
the framework accord signed last July, the Japanese official 
said. Both sides cited earlier commitments that such criteria 
will not become "numerical targets." 
  Such wrangling in the two other key sectors -- government 
procurement and autos and auto parts -- scuttled the framework 
talks in February. 
  The issue of instituting a system of insurance brokers to 
help Japanese consumers get the best policies is "still 
unresolved," the U.S. official said. Japan has agreed in 
principle to the system but the official said there is no point 
in having a broker if there is no real choice among policies or 
prices. 
  The U.S. also wants simpler, clearer licensing procedures. 
  On the other hand, Japan is seeking uniformity in licensing 
in the U.S. insurance market, complaining that state-by-state 
regulatory jurisdictions block foreign firms from entering. 
  The Japanese official said the U.S. agreed to negotiate on 
access to its own market, but the U.S. official refused to 
confirm it. He indicated, however, that U.S. negotiators 
responded to Japanese questions by explaining voluntary measures 
being taken by state insurance commissioners for more uniform 
standards. 
  The U.S. official denied the U.S. is trying to make Tokyo go 
slowly in liberalizing the foreign-dominated "third sector" that 
includes disease and nursing coverage and stands outside of life 
and standard nonlife insurance. 
  But freeing that area ahead of the others would mean "the 
wiping out of many companies in the third sector without any 
opportunity for them to compete in the life and nonlife 
sectors," the U.S. official said. 
  The Japanese official said there were "no particular 
discussions" on the third sector. 
  Bilateral talks were to start Thursday in Washington on 
autos 
and auto parts and Friday in Tokyo on Japanese Government 
procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment.

  [Text] European aircraft makers, including France's 
Aerospatiale and Britain's British Aerospace, complained to the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] on 30 May of 
the "U.S. bias" in the process of selecting a partner to develop 
the small passenger jetliner YSX, a joint project of the 
Japanese Government and private sector, and asked MITI to 
correct this tendency. 
  The Boeing Company of the United States and the Japanese 
have 
already started a feasibility study on YSX. The Europeans 
seriously regard "Boeing's entry into the market of small 
aircraft to be a threat," and competition between the United 
States and Europe is bound to intensify. 
  The complaint was made in a letter from the Aerospace 
Committee (chaired by De Fontaine [name as published], Japan 
representative of Eurocopter) of the European Business 
Association in Japan. The letter says that if partnership 
between Japan and Boeing in small passenger aircraft 
materializes, this will: 1) aggravate the disparity between 
Europe and the United States in Japan's cooperation with foreign 
countries in the aerospace sector; and 2) threaten the existence 
of European companies. 
  YSX is the passenger jetliner that will succeed the 
Japanese-made YS-11. MITI has obtained appropriations for 
research on this aircraft since fiscal 1989. However, joint 
international development is considered indispensable to share 
development costs and strengthen marketing potential. For this 
reason, the Japanese Government and private sector have been 
negotiating with a number of foreign companies, including Boeing 
and ATR, a joint venture company formed by Aerospatiale and 
Italy's Alenia, and plan to select a development partner by this 
summer. 
  Boeing has already started a feasibility study with Japan 
and 
China on small passenger aircraft in preparation for the YSX 
project. This complaint by the European companies seems to have 
been filed amid speculation that "Boeing will be the probable 
partner in the YSX project," and is meant to remind Japan of the 
presence of the European companies.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Japanese International Trade 
and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata will skip a Paris ministerial 
conference of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD), the trade ministry said Thursday. 
  A tight parliamentary schedule has made Hata's attendance at 
the two-day gathering from next Tuesday impossible, the Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry (MITI) explained. 
Parliamentary Vice MITI Minister Tokunosuke Kaneko and Yoshihiro 
Sakamoto, director general of MITI's International Trade Policy 
Bureau, will fly to Paris instead, MITI said. 
  This year's OECD meeting will address three major topics -- 
growth and employment, reinforcing multilateral trade systems 
and the OECD's role amid rapid international change, a MITI 
official said. 
  Whether the chiefs of the Foreign Ministry and the Economic 
Planning Agency will attend the conference has yet to be 
decided, the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
expressed grave concern Thursday [2 June] over North Korea's 
refusal to accept inspections of its suspect nuclear facilities 
sought by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  "If (North Korea) does not talk without reserve, it will 
lead 
to an undesirable direction," Hata told reporters at his 
official residence. "North Korea should take a serious view of 
the concern of the international community." 
  The United States has warned it will seek economic sanctions 
against North Korea if the IAEA is prevented from carrying out 
tests on nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon 
some 90 kilometers from Pyongyang to determine whether spent 
fuel has been diverted to the manufacture of nuclear weapons. 
  North Korea over the past week has been removing spent fuel 
rods from the reactor. The IAEA has warned that its capacity to 
carry out tests will be lost "in days" without proper technical 
arrangements. 
  North Korea has repeatedly prevented IAEA inspectors from 
carrying out full inpections on its nuclear plants, fueling 
suspicions that the country is secretly developing nuclear 
weapons. 
  A government spokesman later said Japan's position is to 
seek 
a peaceful resolution of North Korea's nuclear issue. 
  "We still hope this issue will be resolved in a peaceful 
manner through efforts by the parties concerned," Deputy Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Nobuo Ishihara told a news conference. 
  Ishihara also noted the government is scrutinizing North 
Korea's virtual refusal to accept Monday's UN Security Council 
statement that urged Pyongyang to comply with nuclear safeguards 
requirements. 
  Despite the harshly worded rejection, Ishihara said, no 
noticeable shift in North Korea's stance on the matter can be 
seen. 
  It is not known how the countries involved will respond to 
Pyongyang's renewed refusal to allow international inspections 
of its nuclear reactor as IAEA inspectors are still continuing 
observation in North Korea, he added.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa told a senior Chinese official Thursday [2 Jun] the 
situation regarding North Korea's suspected development of 
nuclear weapons is at a critical stage, ministry officials said. 
  "Inspections (of North Korea's nuclear facilities) are 
becoming increasingly difficult. The situation is at an 
important stage and is tense," the officials quoted Kakizawa as 
telling Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan. 
  In a 15-minute meeting with the Chinese visitor, the 
Japanese 
foreign minister repeated calls for China's cooperation in 
solving the problem, adding he wants to hold close consultations 
with China. 
  Tang told Kakizawa China has been making efforts to seek a 
breakthrough on the problem and will continue to make its utmost 
efforts to peacefully solve it through dialogue, adding China's 
approach to North Korea has limits, the officials said. 
  The resumption of dialogue among North Korea, the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the United States 
is important in seeking a breakthrough to the standoff, Tang was 
saying. 
  He also reiterated China's basic stance that it supports 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, and maintenance of 
peace and stability in the region. 
  China played a "constructive role" in compiling the UN 
Security Council's presidential statement issued Monday, Tang 
said. 
  The council statement "strongly" urged Pyongyang to 
cooperate 
in pulling spent fuel rods from a nuclear reactor so IAEA 
inspectors could determine if any material has been diverted for 
nuclear weapons. 
  Tang delivered an invitation from Chinese Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen for Kakizawa to visit China. 
  If unable to make the trip, the two foreign ministers may be 
able to meet at a meeting of foreign ministers from the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its dialogue 
partners in July, or at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC) meeting in Jakarta in November, Tang quoted Qian as 
saying.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Japan called for China's 
continued cooperation in solving the problems of North Korea's 
alleged development of nuclear weapons, Foreign Ministry 
officials said Wednesday. 
  In diplomatic consultations held at the Foreign Ministry, 
Japanese officials told a Chinese delegation that China's role 
is important in solving the problem, the officials said. 
  Beijing supports the denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula 
and considers peace and stability on the peninsula important, 
the Chinese side was quoted as saying. 
  They also told the Japanese side that now is the time for a 
"calm and constructive" approach by all concerned parties. 
  China wants talks to be held between North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and between 
Washington and Pyongyang, the Chinese diplomats said. 
  Japanese diplomatic officials voiced deep concern over North 
Korea's unmonitored removal of fuel rods from its nuclear 
reactor in Yongbyon, and said North Korea's alleged nuclear 
development concerns the future of the nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty (NPT) system, the officials said. 
  The UN Security Council issued a presidential statement 
Monday "strongly" urging North Korea to cooperate in pulling 
spent fuel rods from a nuclear reactor so IAEA inspectors can 
determine if any material has been diverted for nuclear weapons. 
  The ministry officials declined to elaborate on the contents 
of Wednesday's consultations with China, saying they were not 
"negotiations." 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda led the Japanese 
delegation at the talks held at the Foreign Ministry, while 
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan headed the Chinese 
side. 
  Japan and China have been holding diplomatic talks since 
1980. The previous meeting was held in Beijing in March 1992. 
  Also during the talks, the Japanese side referred to 
comments 
by former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano denying Japan's 
aggression during World War II and the 1937 Nanjing massacre, 
and vowed to make continued efforts to develop bilateral 
relations with China based on remorse for the past, the 
officials said. 
  The Chinese side said China's basic stance is to develop 
relations with Japan by not forgetting the past but by learning 
from it and by looking toward the future. 
  Correctly dealing with the two nations' past is also an 
important political base for promoting bilateral ties, Chinese 
officials were quoted as saying. 
  Japan urged China to refrain from conducting underground 
nuclear tests and expressed hope that Beijing would participate 
in negotiations on the comprehensive test ban treaty in Geneva, 
they said. 
  China replied that it is participating in the negotiations, 
and reiterated that it supports complete abolition of nuclear 
weapons and conducts fewer tests than other nuclear powers, they 
said. 
  Tokyo also asked for Chinese support in its bid to become a 
permanent member of the UN Security Council. 
  The Chinese side replied that the reorganization of the 
council should be dealt with according to consensus and the 
principles of balance, adding that it would consider Japan's bid 
on this basis, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 29 KYODO -- The Defense Agency will set 
up a new working-level group with the U.S. Depertment of Defense 
to promote reciprocal bilateral exchange of military technology, 
agency officials said Sunday [29 May]. 
  The agency expects the group to help make unilateral 
military 
technology transfer between the two countries reciprocal, the 
officials said. 
  The first meeting of the "technology management group" will 
be held in Washington in July. The group will be set up under 
the Japan-U.S. Systems and Technology Forum, the officials said. 
  The group, expected to establish a "basic rule" for 
bilateral 
military technology exchange for the first time, will determine 
the types of general-purpose technology suitable for such 
exchange by the end of the year. 
  The officials said both nations will protect intellectual 
rights when private interests are involved in military 
technology transfers, by paying attention to the laws of each 
nation and its independent policies, so that technology 
procurement will be made on a commercial basis. 
  The United States has already shown interest in such 
Japanese 
technology as new materials and electronics, they said. 
  In 1983, Japan decided to open the way for transferal of 
military technology to the U.S. as an exception to its principle 
of banning arms export.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Japan and Russia will soon 
announce plans to build a disposal plant for liquid nuclear 
waste near Vladivostok in the Russian Far East, Foreign Ministry 
sources said Thursday [2 June]. 
  The plant, to be funded from a Japanese 70 million dollar 
grant for denuclearization, is expected to be completed within 
this year, the sources said. 
  The Japanese Government has agreed in principle to construct 
the facility, which would filter radioactive substances from the 
liquid waste, on an offshore dock as requested by Moscow. 
  For lack of storage and treatment facilities the former 
Soviet Union and Russia have been dumping hundreds of tons of 
nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan and other waters off its 
coasts. 
  The disclosure of the decades-long nuclear dumping has 
sparked international protests and strained relations between 
Tokyo and Moscow. 
  Japan last autumn offered to lend Russia a tanker to provide 
urgently needed storage capacity, but Moscow later retreated 
from the plan and proposed to build the waste disposal plant 
instead. 
  Moscow repeatedly told Japan it would have to resume nuclear 
dumping at sea if the plant was not built quickly. 
  The sources said final approval for the project might still 
be held up by apparent differences between Moscow and 
Vladivostok authorities about the nature of the plant.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Strengthening of economic 
relations between China and Japan is good not only for the two 
countries but also for the Asia-Pacific region and the whole 
world, China's trade minister said here Thursday [2 Jun]. 
  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister Wu Yi made 
the remark in her meeting with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata in 
the Diet building, a Foreign Ministry official said. 
  Wu, who previously met Hata in Seattle last November, also 
expressed hope for early implementation of Japan's planned 
fourth package of yen loans to China through official 
development assistance, the official said. 
  Hata replied that Japan should try to forge future-oriented 
relations with China based on repentance over controversial 
remarks by former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano, the official 
said. 
  Nagano resigned in early May over his remarks that the 1937 
Nanjing Massacre never happened and that Japan was not an 
aggressor in World War II.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Chinese Foreign Trade and 
Economic Minister Wu Yi on Thursday [2 Jun] asked Japan to 
exercise prudence in taking a unilateral measure to curb textile 
imports from China. 
  Meeting Japanese International Trade and Industry Minister 
Eijiro Hata in Tokyo, Wu said, "China is concerned about Japan's 
invocation of a discriminatory curb on textile imports," 
according to ministry officials. 
  "Beijing cannot accept such a step," Wu was quoted as 
saying. 
  The Chinese trade minister was referring to a set of rules 
recently worked out by a Japanese Government panel for 
activating a safeguard measure on textile imports under the 
multifiber agreement (MFA). 
  The rules are designed to protect the Japanese textile 
industry from possible damage following massive textile imports, 
especially from China. 
  Japanese trade minister Hata said Tokyo is prepared to 
discuss the issue with China on a working-level. 
  Wu said China will strive to make its textile exports 
orderly, the officials told reporters. 
  The remark hints at Beijing's preparedness to introduce a 
voluntary curb on textile exports to Japan in order to prevent 
Japanese invocation of the safeguard measure. 
  During the one-hour meeting, Wu requested that Japan map out 
a framework for its fourth yen-loan program for China, the 
ministry officials said. 
  Hata replied that Japan will work out specifics of 60 
projects being selected under the five-year lending program from 
1996 "as early as possible," they said. 
  Hata was quoted as saying Japan will support China's early 
admission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
But there remain various problems to clear the way for 
Beijing's smooth entry to GATT, including China's quantitative 
import restrictions, dual pricing systems and inconsistent 
enforcement of administrative rules between the central 
government and local governments, Hata said. 
  "China should reform these domestic systems so that its 
economy can be incorporated into the global economic system at 
an early time," he said. 
  Wu arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday for an eight-day visit to 
Japan aimed at encouraging Japanese investment in China. She is 
the first Chinese cabinet minister to visit Japan since the 
government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was formed in late 
April.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Finnish mobile phone maker 
Nokia aims to capture a 20 percent share in Japan's digital 
cellular phone market, a senior company official said Wednesday 
[1 June]. 
  Nokia Vice President Jouko Hayrynen told KYODO NEWS SERVICE 
he expects Japan to become a trendsetter in Asia's mobile phone 
market as seen by the boom that followed the government's 
decision to allow makers to retail instead of lease their 
products. Helped by the deregulation, the number of mobile 
phone suppliers in Japan has since doubled to more than 25. 
  Nokia, the world's second-largest mobile phone maker after 
Motorola Inc. of the United States, will finish preparations for 
volume production of models tailored to the Japanese market by 
the end of this month, Hayrynen said. Hayrynen said the 
Japanese mobile phone market is estimated at 1.3 million to 1.5 
million units this year, of which about 50 percent will be 
digital machines.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- The Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren) asked the government Wednesday [1 
June] to hear industry views on its plans to control exports of 
goods convertible for weapons production, Keidanren officials 
said. 
  The powerful business organization made the request as the 
government began to study measures to regulate exports of such 
products in line with its policy of preventing proliferation of 
nuclear and conventional weapons. 
  The government plans to enforce regulations on the basis of 
a 
recommendation to be made by the Industrial Structure Council, 
an advisory body to the minister of international trade and 
industry. 
  Keidanren said the proposed regulation will have a serious 
impact on domestic manufacturers, particularly on those who are 
not familiar with export controls. 
  The federation called on the government to hear views from 
industries concerned in working out new regulations and give 
them enough time for familiarization, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Both import and export 
contracts concluded in April by 19 major Japanese trading houses 
fell from a year earlier, an industry group reported Monday [30 
May]. 
  The Japan Foreign Trade Council, which groups major trading 
companies, said the export contracts were down 18.0 percent in 
value to 656.3 billion yen and import contracts fell 24.0 
percent to 906.7 billion yen. 
  Export contracts posted the sixth consecutive year-on-year 
fall and import contracts recorded the seventh such drop. 
  The council blamed the decreased export contracts on a slump 
in auto export contracts, which it said stemmed from the yen's 
appreciation and increased production by Japanese-owned assembly 
plants overseas. 
  The lower import contracts were blamed on declines in 
purchases of crude oil, as well as purchase of petroleum 
products from Southeast Asia. 
  The council said exports are likely to recover in the coming 
months, noting that demand is increasing for automobiles and 
steel in the United States and other markets. 
  Imports may also increase in the months ahead, especially of 
machinery from other Asian countries, the council said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Japan's exports of cars, 
trucks and buses in April dropped 16.2 percent from a year 
earlier for the 13th straight month, an industry association 
reported Monday [30 May]. 
  The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, however, 
said 
exports to the United States climbed 11.4 percent, marking the 
first upturn in nine months. 
  The association said April exports totaled 367,230 vehicles, 
with passenger cars accounting for 272,923, down 17.3 percent. 
  Exports of trucks fell 10.5 percent to 88,756, while 
shipments of buses overseas plunged 36.6 percent to 5,551. 
  The association said exports of automobiles to the U.S. 
totaled 135,147, up from 121,367 a year earlier. 
  Exports to Europe plunged 24.5 percent to 83,456 vehicles, 
reflecting sluggish demand on the European market, the 
association said. 
  It said exports to Asia plummeted 43.7 percent, reflecting 
flagging demand in China and Thailand. 
  The April exports, including components and parts, were 
valued at 6.91 billion dollars, down 2.4 percent from a year 
before, the association said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- The Japan Association of 
Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai) on Wednesday [1 Jun] 
requested anew that the Japanese Government make further efforts 
to smoothly implement political, economic and administrative 
reforms. 
  Chairman Masaru Hayami made the request during a breakfast 
meeting with International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro 
Hata and other trade ministry officials. 
  Electorate seat redistribution, as part of political 
reforms, 
should be completed during the current parliamentary session 
while a tax reform package containing tax cuts and an offsetting 
consumption tax increase two or three years later should be 
formulated soon, Hayami said, echoing the voice of about 35 
other corporate executives present at the breakfast meeting. 
  Hayami also urged the government to take concrete measures 
to 
narrow a price gap between home and abroad, reduce Japan's huge 
current account surplus, upgrade the labor market and revise a 
spending plan for public works projects for an efficient fund 
allocation. 
  Trade Minister Hata replied that the government will do its 
utmost to address the requests but refrained from making clear 
commitments on specific requests.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- A Ministry of Finance [MOF] 
report on tax reform was not an attempt to control debate on 
planned tax hikes and cuts, and the ministry will provide 
additional estimates on the planned tax reform if requested, a 
top ministry official said Monday [30 May]. 
  Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a news conference that 
the ministry report, issued last Friday, on revenue estimates 
for tax cuts and hikes had "no policy implications." 
  "We will consider positively (on revising the estimates) if 
requested," Saito said in brushing off criticism that his 
ministry is again trying to steer debate on the tax reform, 
particularly in regards to the tax hike rate, maturity of 
stopgap bonds and fiscal streamlining. 
  Saito said the report was just a "mechanical calculation" to 
serve as a basis for further discussions by a government tax 
panel and the ruling coalition parties. 
  Pressed by reporters to explain why estimates for a tax hike 
of below 7 percent was not included in the report, Saito said, 
"there's no reason for us to reject if requested to calculate 
estimates on the basis of a 6 percent tax rate." 
  The report, submitted upon request to the tax commission and 
the ruling parties, estimates net revenues in fiscal 2000 after 
tax cuts of 6.2 percent are extended and the current 3 percent 
consumption tax is raised to between 7 percent and 10 percent in 
April 1997. 
  The ministry was criticized for its failure to include 
estimates on a tax hike of below 7 percent, a "natural" tax 
revenue increase and possible effects from fiscal and 
administrative overhauls. 
  It was also criticized for setting conditions of redeeming 
stopgap bonds to 10 years and financing expected increases in 
welfare spending wholly with the tax hike. The stopgap bonds 
would fund the three-year time lag between tax cuts and hike. 
  After reviewing the report Friday, the ruling coalition 
asked 
the ministry for estimates that include a consumption tax hike 
of between 4 percent and 6 percent, "natural" revenue increases 
and a 20-year maturity for the stopgap bonds, a ministry 
official said. 
  Saito said the ministry has not decided on conditions for 
redeeming stopgap bonds in 10 years but said, "we want to redeem 
them as early as possible." 
  He said fiscal and administrative reforms were "yet unclear 
with discussions still under way."

  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Fiscal 1993 tax revenues are 
expected to fall short of the government's estimates, with 
declared income tax proceeds posting lower-than-projected 
growth, the Ministry of Finance [MOF] said Thursday [2 June]. 
  The ministry reported that cumulative revenues from taxes 
levied as of April for fiscal 1993 came to 47,496.83 billion 
yen, up a scant 0.8 percent from the year before but lower than 
a 2.3 percent growth estimated in the third supplementary budget. 
  The figures are for taxes in fiscal 1993 that ended on March 
31. 
  The taxes collected as of April 30 came to 87.2 percent of 
the 55,650.00 billion yen estimated in the supplementary budget, 
the rate being down 1.2 percentage point from a year earlier. 
  "Attaining the supplementary budget estimates is not easy," 
a 
ministry official said, citing the lower-than-expected growth in 
declared income tax proceeds. 
  He said it all depends on corporate and consumption taxes to 
be collected in May for the fiscal 1993 book closing in March by 
almost all Japanese companies. "We can't give definite 
estimates because big fluctuations are expected," he said. 
  But private think tanks projected an overall revenue 
shortfall of some 1 trillion yen for fiscal 1993. 
  Because of the prolonged economic slump, the government has 
already trimmed tax revenue estimates twice in two extra budgets 
following the initial 1993 budget. 
  Cumulative proceeds from declared income tax as of the end 
of 
April came to 4,573.96 billion yen, up 0.9 percent from the year 
before, but sharply lower than the estimated 11.4 percent growth. 
  Yearly declarations are made by March, and declared income 
taxes are levied in April. 
  "Declared income tax revenues are certain to fall below the 
estimates" of 5,302.00 billion yen, the official said. 
  Overall tax revenues for April alone came to 5,150.68 
billion 
yen, up 1.7 percent from the year before, the ministry reported. 
  Income tax revenues in April totaled 3,563.21 billion yen, 
up 
3.5 percent, with cumulative revenues standing at 22,991.85 
billion yen, up 2.1 percent but lower than the previously 
estimated 3.9 percent growth. 
  Declared income tax proceeds in April rose 5.8 percent to 
2,299.64 billion yen, and withholding tax revenues fell 0.5 
percent to 1,263.57 billion yen. 
  Corporate tax proceeds in April fell 8.0 percent to 551.23 
billion yen, stemming from sluggish earnings by both major and 
smaller companies that closed their books in February, the 
official said. 
  As a result, cumulative corporate tax revenues stood at 
8,937.71 billion yen, down 10.2 percent, compared with a 
projected 1.5 percent decline. 
  Consumption tax revenues dropped 8.0 percent in April to 
427.69 billion yen, with the cumulative amount standing at 
3,932.74 billion yen, up 9.1 percent and higher than an 
estimated 4.1 percent rise. 
  As for other major items, the official said there were no 
major changes in the tax revenue trends.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- The Ministry of Finance 
[MOF] plans to allow a portion of the revenues collected from 
the consumption tax to be handled by local governments, ministry 
sources said Monday [30 May]. 
  The ministry will soon offer a compromise proposal to the 
Home Affairs Ministry, which, along with local governments, has 
urged the introduction of a local consumption tax. 
  Currently, the state government collects all consumption tax 
revenues and distributes 20 percent of revenues to autonomies. 
  Under the Finance Ministry proposal, the same proportion of 
income from the consumption tax will be collected by 
municipalities and then pooled and distributed according to 
population and consumption levels. 
  Introduction of a local consumption tax is one of the 
focuses 
in the planned tax system overhaul the government plans to work 
out by late June. 
  The Finance Ministry initially opposed the idea but has 
conceded in the face of mounting calls for the need to boost the 
financial base of local governments. 
  Its proposal is slightly different from that of the Home 
Affairs Ministry, which requested that Japan's 47 prefectures 
collect the tax and the money gathered be distributed in 
accordance with the number of workers in each prefecture. 
  If the Finance Ministry's plan is accepted, the share of 
revenues for such major cities as Tokyo and Osaka will be much 
smaller than the original plan because many people who work in 
the major cities live outside city limits.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Japan's six major electric 
machinery makers plan to spend 15.4 percent more on business 
investment for semiconductor production in fiscal 1994 than they 
did the previous year, according to their projections. 
  The six concerns -- Hitachi Ltd., Fujitsu Ltd., NEC Corp., 
Toshiba Corp., Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and Oki Electric 
Industry Co. -- set aside a total of 461 billion yen for 
investment for the fiscal year that ends March 31, 1995, up from 
399.6 billion yen the year before. 
  Industry officials cited an unabated personal computer boom 
in the United States and bright prospects for domestic demand as 
factors behind the bullish spending plans. 
  The bulk of these investment is targeted at memory chips, 
for 
which demand is shifting from 4-megabit dynamic random access 
memory (dram) chips to 16-megabit dram chips. 
  "The shift in demand for 16-megabit dram chips will be put 
into top gear" in the latter half of this year, said Hajime 
Sasaki, managing director at NEC. 
  NEC, now an industry leader in 16-megabit dram chips, 
expects 
to raise manufacturing capacity to 3 million units a month by 
next March from the current one million. 
  Hitachi is trying to catch up with NEC in the 16-megabit 
dram 
chip market with a project to raise monthly capacity at one of 
its main domestic chip factories to 3 million units, also by 
next March. 
  Fujitsu's investment plan calls for investing more than 100 
billion yen, its first such layout in three years, while Toshiba 
and Mitsubishi plan to increase investment for the first time in 
three years after keeping their investments flat for the past 
two years. 
  Oki, which returned to profitability in the latest business 
year ended March 31, expects to double its investment for chip 
production.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- The Food Agency has exerted 
pressure on a major rice wholesaler not to protest the 
government's food control policies, it was learned Wednesday [1 
June]. 
  The agency asked Bunji Nakamura, president of Yamatane 
Corp., 
to keep the company's outspoken chairman Seizo Yamazaki from 
making provocative remarks against Japan's food control system, 
in which the government keeps a tight grip on production and 
marketing of rice. 
  The agency made the request on March 16 when it called 
Nakamura to ask for Yamatane's cooperation in sales of imported 
rice. 
  The agency denied the accusation, but other reports said 
that 
it has asked members of farm ministry panels and food-services 
industry officials not to criticize the government's policies.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Bank of Japan Governor 
Yasushi Mieno told the Diet on Wednesday [1 June] the domestic 
economy is showing signs of recovery. 
  Mieno told the House of Representatives Budget Committee, "I 
think the downturn is about to end, and the environment for 
economic recovery has almost been completed." 
  He cited progress in inventory adjustments, the effects of 
the government's fiscal and monetary measures and economic 
recovery overseas as favorable factors. 
  Mieno, however, took a cautious view of recovery, saying it 
remains to be seen whether the bright signs will continue 
because of uncertainty over the yen's exchange rates against 
other currencies and employment adjustments.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Japan's business leaders 
remain cautious about the future course of the domestic economy, 
despite some signs of recovery, the Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren) said Thursday [2 June]. 
  The organization, which polled 152 top executives of large 
corporations in mid-May, said four out of five businessmen 
expect business conditions to improve in the second half of the 
current business year or later. 
  According to the results, 75.0 percent of those surveyed 
said 
the economy's future course is unpredictable, though they have 
seen some signs of bottoming out. 
  Another 24.3 percent said the economy has not yet bottomed 
out, while only 0.7 percent said the economy has already hit 
bottom and prospects are bright. 
  As for the timing of recovery, 40.6 percent said they expect 
it in the October-December period this year, while 39.9 percent 
predicted the January-March period or later next year. 
  On corporate capital investment, many of the surveyed said 
recovery will take a considerably long time because many 
companies are slowly completing stock adjustment. 
  Some respondents also predicted that major corporations will 
shift their investment from domestic to overseas markets to take 
advantage of the higher yen. 
  They predicted investment will for a while center on 
rationalizing equipment and renewing existing facilities as part 
of their restructuring programs. 
  Corporate investment that will boost the economy will come 
much later, they added.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Plant and equipment 
investment by Japanese corporations in fiscal 1994 will edge up 
1.1 percent from the previous year on an all-industry basis, 
marking the first gain in three years, a survey by the Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry (MITI) revealed Thursday [2 
June]. 
  The planned spending for this year was revised upward from a 
0.1 percent drop estimated in the initial forecast. 
  The showing could be taken as a sign that corporate capital 
spending in Japan stopped decelerating, said the Industrial 
Structure Council, an advisory body to the trade minister. 
  But the upturn was mainly in reaction to a marked 8.7 
percent 
fall estimated for fiscal 1993, the council said, noting 
corporate managers are still cautious about boosting investment 
for the current year. 
  The survey was conducted at the end of March to update the 
original survey of October last year. It covered 1,615 
companies in 11 manufacturing sectors and seven nonmanufacturing 
sectors. 
  The survey revealed outlays by manufacturers for fiscal 1994 
will drop 3.5 percent, the third consecutive yearly fall but a 
substantial improvement from an estimated 19.6 percent drop in 
the previous year. 
  Nonmanufacturers plan to boost spending by 3.6 percent for 
this year after suffering an estimated 1.1 percent dip the 
preceding year. 
  The council said corporate inventory adjustment appears to 
have progressed substantially. But an excess of facility 
investment made during the boom of the late 1980s still lingers 
among major Japanese corporations, leaving the possibility of 
their inventory adjustment being further prolonged. 
  In view of an expected further delay in a full-scale 
recovery 
in final demand and manufacturing activity, it is likely to take 
a "substantially long time" before plant and equipment 
investment in Japan shifts to a smooth growth track, the council 
said. 
  It also said restructuring efforts are underway in sectors 
that would lead to an immediate cut in fixed expenses, but added 
that such efforts lack a long-term business prospect, noting 
spending aimed to promote research and development and create 
new business has been stagnant. 
  The survey said Japanese companies' direct overseas 
investment will continue to slacken in fiscal 1994, falling 27.9 
percent from the previous year. 
  But Asia-bound investment for the reporting year will surge 
26.0 percent in a turnaround from an estimated 2.6 percent slide 
in the previous year. 
  Investment in Asia by manufacturers will grow a sharper 56.1 
percent, following an estimated 3.5 percent fall in fiscal 1993. 
  As a result, Japan's direct investment in other Asian 
countries this year will account for 37.5 percent of the total 
overseas spending, up from 16.4 percent in the previous year. 
  The tilt toward Asian investment reflects Japanese 
companies' 
added emphasis on enhancing cost competitiveness, the council 
said. 
  As a way to put Japan's corporate activity on a smooth 
recovery track, the council proposed the government carry out 
macroeconomic policy measures adequately and flexibly in line 
with a series of market-priming packages. 
  The government should also support corporate restructuring 
efforts to facilitate creation of new business through tax 
incentives, deregulation and diversification of fund raising, 
the council said.

  [Text] North Korea hinted that it would withdraw from the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty if the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] officially declares that the possibility of 
the further measurement of fuel rods is dissipated, or the UN 
Security Council takes steps to impose sanctions on North Korea. 
  A high-level official of the North Korean Mission to the 
United Nations, in quoting the statement by the North Korean 
Foreign Ministry, said that if some circles of the IAEA declare 
that the possibility for the further measurement of the nuclear 
fuel rods has dissipated technically, or the UN Security Council 
pressures North Korea by imposing sanctions, North Korea will 
take a decisive step to deal with them, rather than suffer from 
their unreasonable steps. Therefore, he hinted at the 
possibility that North Korea would withdraw from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  Also, he admitted that North Korea accelerated the speed of 
the work to replace the nuclear fuel rods some time ago in order 
to test the maximum efficiency of the machine that carries out 
the work.

  [Text] Yun Ho-chin, counselor of the North Korean embassy 
in Vienna and chief delegate to the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA], said in an interview with REUTER on 2 June that 
the IAEA is making an unreasonable demand for inspections and, 
as a result, North Korea will definitely be compelled to 
withdraw [taltoerul kangyobatchi annulsu opta] from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. Stressing that North Korea's 
intent is revealing its nuclear transparency, Counselor Yun said 
that he is scheduled to have a discussion with IAEA officials 
this afternoon to defuse the nuclear crisis.

  [Text] The government is reportedly pushing for a United 
Nations resolution to impose sanctions on North Korea right 
after holding consultations with the United States and others in 
case North Korea has removed the possibility for future 
measurements by continuing to replace fuel rods. 
  Kim Sam-hun, nuclear ambassador, who left the country on 2 
June to have a three-day policy consultations between the ROK, 
the United States, and Japan in Washington, pointed out that 
warning measures have sufficiently been taken up until now. He 
added that the government's position is that it is now 
inevitable to take measures related to the imposition of 
sanctions against the North. 
  Since our government, the United States, and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency have so far made many efforts 
for dialogue, Ambassador Kim Sam-hun said, it will also be 
difficult for China to offer opposition if a resolution for 
sanctions is discussed at the United Nations.

  [Text] After rejecting IAEA's [International Atomic Energy 
Agency] attempt to monitor the removal of spent fuel from the 
5-megawatt reactor, North Korea appears to be wary of possible 
international sanctions. 
  According to Naewoe Press, South's official North Korean 
watcher, said North Korea abruptly increased radio broadcasts 
and newspaper articles arguing that sanctions will not work, 
claiming that they will not serve the interests of the United 
States either. 
  Meanwhile, North Korea stresses the importance of dialogue 
with the United States for peaceful solution to the nuclear 
issue. 
  All of these are seen to be a revelation of how seriously 
North Korea is holding on to the coattail of the United States 
to avoid possible sanctions which it really fears, North Korean 
observers said. 
  The radio said North Korea is prepared for either war or 
dialogue. 
  North Korea also took issue with the remarks of Russian 
Ambassador to Seoul Georgiy Kunadze. He said North Korea should 
live up to all international nuclear obligations as an NPT 
[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty] member. 
  An article in the NODONG SINMUN, organ of the North Korean 
Workers' Party, said North Korea has no obligations citing the 
special position of suspending its move to withdraw from the 
NPT. Because of this, North Korea is not in the NPT nor out of 
it either.

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Cha-su] </F>
  [Text] On 27 May, North Korea and the United States held 
working-level contacts on two occasions and discussed the 
schedule and agenda for the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, but 
no final agreement was reached. However, since North Korea and 
the United States both feel that it is necessary to hold the 
third round of DPRK-U.S. talks at an early date, government 
authorities view that the DPRK-U.S. talks can be held before 10 
June at the latest. 
  Even though the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks is being 
delayed somewhat more than expected, the government has already 
reached an agreement with the United States on the strategy that 
it will take regarding the third round of talks. Kim Sam-hun, 
ambassador in charge of nuclear issues, who returned on 26 May 
after visiting the United States to deal with this matter said: 
"The basic position of the ROK and the United States is that 
both countries will make an attempt to completely resolve the 
North Korean nuclear issue at the third round of DPRK-U.S. 
talks." In connection with the North Korean nuclear issue, the 
two countries are of the position that the issues of completely 
returning to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]; 
receiving special inspection [tukpyol sachal] of unnotified 
facilities; and accepting the International Atomic Energy 
Agency's [IAEA] demand for inspection on the replacement of the 
fuel rods in the five-megawatt atomic reactor, must be demanded 
to North Korea and implemented. On the other hand, if these are 
implemented, the ROK and the United States agree that the issue 
of improving DPRK-U.S. relations and economic assistance, which 
North Korea is demanding, can be discussed on a comprehensive 
level. However, the ROK and the United States are of the 
position that they will not settle for a package deal which is 
to simultaneously exchange each other's demands, which is being 
demanded by North Korea. 
  If the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks is held, the 
government 
decided that it will demand that North Korea completely return 
to the NPT and meet the conditions of the IAEA's demands on the 
replacement of the fuel rods first. This is due to the judgment 
that since North Korea is continuing to refuse ordinary 
inspection [tongsang sachal] by putting forth its special status 
in that its withdrawal from the NPT is still being withheld, it 
is urgent to return North Korea to the NPT and normalize 
ordinary inspection. Also, using its special status, North Korea 
is refusing the IAEA's condition in storing the fuel rods which 
were selected voluntarily. Therefore, if North Korea promises to 
completely return to the NPT, the tug-of-war regarding the 
replacement of the fuel rods will be able to come to an end. 
  The ROK and the United States decided that even during the 
third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, if measures for nuclear safety 
is broken because North Korea decides to unilaterally replace 
the fuel rods, they will suspend the talks. 
  However, the ROK and the United States already agreed that 
if 
North Korea completely returns to the NPT and responds to 
holding discussions on the issue of special inspection, they 
will hold a wide range of discussions on the demands made by 
North Korea including the issue of improving DPRK-U.S. 
relations. It also seems that practical discussions on methods 
for resuming South-North dialogue to discuss the issue of 
implementing the South-North declaration on denuclearization 
will be held at the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. Even though 
the government withdrew the exchange of special envoys as a 
precondition for the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, the ROK and 
the United States decided that they will carry out the 
South-North dialogue in a mutual and supplementary way to 
discuss the DPRK-U.S. talks and the issue of South-North mutual 
inspection. 
  In the issue of improving DPRK-U.S. relations, issues other 
than the nuclear issue are linked such as North Korea's 
missiles, human rights, and terrorism issues. Therefore, 
government authorities view that there is high possibility that 
discussions for a full-scale improvement in relations will be 
held at a separate political consultation which will be held 
after the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  Regardless of this kind of strategy by the ROK and the 
United 
States, how the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks will proceed will 
be determined in connection with how North Korea deals with this 
matter. Therefore, the government authorities still worry about 
this matter.

<F P=106> [From the "Press Pocket" column: "No Confederation"] </F>
  [Text] President Kim Yong-sam has said that national 
reunification should not be realized under a confederalized 
system. He said it was a grave fallacy to think of confederation 
as the formula for national reunification. He made the remarks 
after receiving a briefing on the operation of a fighter wing on 
Friday as if to clamp down on the emerging argument in favor of 
a confederational system as a form of national reunification. 
He said he cannot consent to the people thinking of a 
confederation system out of an emotional yearning for national 
reunification. "We should seek a viable and sustainable formula 
for national reunification, he said. 
  Kim's remarks appear to be aimed at Kim Tae-chung, who said 
upon arrival here from his tour of the United States the 
previous day that people should be given the right to freely 
debate the national reunification issue, proposing a referendum 
on desirable unification formula. Kim Tae-chung has opted for a 
confederation system as a means of eventual national 
reunification. Meanwhile, North Korea has persistently held on 
to the confederation system for unification.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Though North Korea Has Said It Would Open the </F>
`Najin-Sonbong Region'...."] 
  [Text] North Korea has announced a plan to liberalize 
investments and to use port facilities in the Najin-Sonbong 
region as part of an economic open-door policy to break through 
its economic difficulties. 
  The North Korean economy has faced serious difficulties 
because its economic ties with Russia have drastically weakened 
since the end of the cold war, because its relations with China 
have not been smooth, and because its "chuche-oriented economy" 
has become more inefficient. 
  North Korea has reached the moment when it has to, 
unavoidably, open itself up to the capitalist global economy to 
overcome its economic difficulties. North Korea's agony is that 
its domestic system is not flexible enough to absorb fully a 
possible shock from a Chinese-style open-door policy. 
  Therefore, a difficulty facing North Korea is that it is 
trying to carry out a "policy for opening its economy on a 
limited scale" without making domestic reforms, rather than 
pursuing a policy for boldly opening its economy while making 
domestic reforms. China has successfully carried out a bold 
open-door policy despite significant adverse effects; while 
North Korea is experimenting with a limited open-door policy in 
the Najin-Sonbong region, the northernmost border area, to 
prevent a shock from the open-door policy. 
  North Korea is now facing two difficulties. North Korea must 
resolve its economic difficulties to maintain its system -- 
then, North Korea's opening up will be inevitable. If North 
Korea opens up economically, however, it would exert an 
unpredictable influence on its hardened system. 
  North Korea will not be able to bring about successes in 
opening up if it does not make reforms. If North Korea is to 
bring about successes in opening up, which is necessary for 
maintaining its system, it must go beyond its efforts in the 
Najin-Sonbong region and carry out an open-door policy while 
making domestic reforms. It must quickly replace its political, 
economic, social, and cultural systems, which have so far helped 
maintain its secretive regime, with new ones that can 
accommodate a new open-door policy. 
  Unless North Korea makes these efforts, it will not be able 
to expect the same successes, which China has brought about by 
opening up, from its introduction of capital and technology from 
advanced capitalist countries that may be possible when the 
North Korean nuclear issue is resolved. There will be many 
trials and errors in North-South economic exchange and 
cooperation and no great successes will be brought about before 
North Korea opens up while "making reforms." 
  North-South economic cooperation will bring about 
substantial 
successes only when North Korea provides itself with systematic 
mechanisms that help bring about successes in opening up. 
Therefore, North-South economic cooperation must be prudently 
carried out in step with the speed of North Korea's opening up.

  [Text] It was confirmed on 27 May that North Korea has yet 
to withdraw U.S. $3.3 million of the $10 million it deposited in 
the Hong Kong branch of the Arab bank BCCI [Bank of Credit and 
Commerce International] that went bankrupt in 1991. North Korea 
deposited $10 million in the BCCI's Hong Kong branch in the name 
of the Korea Light Industry Commission in 1990. However, it has 
only withdrawn $6.7 million from the bank since the BCCI 
headquarters went bankrupt in July 1991, and is now waiting for 
the bank's settlement to pay $3.3 million, the remainder of its 
deposit.

  [Text] President Kim Yong-sam said yesterday that South 
Korea and the United States are determined to resolutely deal 
together with any threat to freedom and peace on the Korean 
peninsula in particular and in Northeast Asia in general, 
including the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Doing so is the "best way to make the sacrifices of U.S. 
military personnel in the cause of freedom and democracy even 
more invaluable," Kim said in a message he sent to officers and 
men and women of the U.S. Forces Korea on the occasion of the 
U.S. Memorial Day yesterday. 
  He said that the Korean people will never forget the fact 
that so many brave American service members sacrificed 
themselves to help defend freedom in Korea against the Communist 
aggressors. 
  "Today, democracy, freedom and a free-market economy are all 
flourishing in the Republic of Korea, and this fact is widely 
regarded as representing the most illustrious success story of 
American idealism abroad," he said. 
  "Its abundant fruit is being shared not only by our two 
countries but also by the world at large," the President 
stressed. 
  He went on, "The bonds of alliance between the Republic of 
Korea and the United States have been cemented with blood and 
tears. This means that we are, and will long remain, close and 
trusted friends." 
  Praying for the souls of the numerous American service 
members, the President said, "On behalf of our people, I extend 
wholehearted encouragement and boundless trust to all members of 
the U.S. Forces Korea and wish all of you good health and 
well-being."

  [Text] Chinhae, South Korea, May 28 (YONHAP) -- South 
Korea's two escort destroyers left Chinhae Port Saturday morning 
to participate in multinational maritime maneuvers held in the 
mid-western Pacific Ocean. 
  The "Chongju-ham" and "Pusan-ham" are scheduled to hold 
anti-submarine and logistics exercises jointly with U.S. Naval 
elements in the East Sea until May 30, then head for the sea 
near Hawaii to conduct various maneuvers with units from other 
Pacific Rim countries until July 16. 
  "Rimpac 94" (Rim Pacific Exercise), drawing the 
participation 
of South Korea, the United States, Australia, Canada and Japan, 
is designed to secure major maritime transportation routes in 
the Pacific Ocean and promote the combined operational 
capabilities and cooperation of Pacific rim countries. 
  The exercises will cover mobile offensive-defensive battle, 
command-control-communication, and anti-aircraft, anti-submarine 
and electronic warfares, and ship-to-ship and ship-to-air 
firing, and torpedo and missile firing. 
  About 60 military vessels including two aircraft carriers, 
over 200 aircraft and a 25,000-strong naval force are expected 
to participate in the biennial exercise, which was inaugurated 
in 1971. It is the third time for South Korea to participate in 
the maneuvers since 1990, when it first took part. 
  By joining in the exercise, the South Korean Navy is 
expected 
to promote military exchanges with the navies of Pacific rim 
countries as well as learn advanced naval strategy and tactics.

  [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam, 
during his tour of Russia and Uzbekistan that starts June 1, 
will be accompanied by six businessmen as guests at 
economy-related events. 
  Chairmen Kim U-chung of the Daewoo Business Group, Cho 
Sok-nae of Hyosung Group, Ku Pyong-hoe of Lucky-Goldstar Group 
and concurrently head of the Korea Foreign Trade Association 
(KFTA), and Chang Chi-hyok of Kohap Group, as well as presidents 
of smaller businesses -- Wang Ho-sang of Dongho International 
and Kim Yun-sik of Shindong Enercom Inc. -- will arrive 
separately in Moscow but travel aboard the president's plane to 
Uzbekistan due to poor air transportation there. 
  It is the first time for businessmen to travel with Kim on 
his chartered plane. 
  "We weren't planning to invite businessmen on this tour, but 
we finally decided to include six businessmen whose companies 
have made inroads in Russia and Uzbekistan to attend only 
economy-related events there at the request of the two 
countries," a Chongwadae (presidential office) official said. 
  Just as some businessmen arrived separately to attend 
economy-related functions during Kim's visits to Japan and 
China, the business representatives will only take part in these 
events, he said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Reason for the President's Visit to Russia"] </F>
  [Text] President Kim Yong-sam's visit to Russia to begin on 
1 June is significant in that it will complete the basic frame 
of the ROK's tetragonal diplomacy. With President Kim's 
forthcoming Russia visit, which will follow his visit to the 
United States in November 1993 and to Japan and China in March 
1994, it appears to us that he gives priority in dealing with 
countries that are most important to us. 
  We hope that President Kim's tetragonal diplomacy will 
provide an important momentum for peace and reunification of the 
Korean peninsula and for durable peace in Northeast Asia. Since 
we cannot help but be concerned about the North Korean nuclear 
issue, we have great expectations of cooperation from strong 
neighboring countries that can exert considerable influence upon 
North Korea. 
  In particular, we have many difficulties in building new 
relations with Russia because it still maintains political, 
diplomatic, economic, and military relations with North Korea 
that were established in the age of the former Soviet Union 
empire. Rapid improvement out of need and sudden cooling down 
have alternated in ROK-Russian relations mainly because Russia's 
policy on the Korean peninsula has been in a transition period. 
  Accordingly, the most important task of President Kim's 
upcoming visit to Russia is to show Russia a new direction to 
completely free itself from the former Soviet Union's policy on 
the Korean peninsula. The ROK should become a country with 
which is worth trying to expand relations. 
  To achieve this goal, we have to seriously reflect on the 
trials and errors in our relations with Russia, and humbly 
reassess Russia's potential. Although our expectations, 
amplified in those early days of improved relations between the 
two countries, have turned into dissatisfaction, we should not 
maintain our present view of Russia. We should know the fact 
that our efforts can give more room for interests that can be 
obtained in mutual cooperation with Russia. 
  It is true that there are many delicate pending issues 
between the ROK and Russia. However, they might be minor 
problems to be solved through a long-term basis approach of 
relations between the two countries. 
  Russia should also assume a fresh diplomatic attitude to 
achieve the goal it had when improving its relations with us 
while treating North Korea inhospitably. It is important for 
Russia to abandon the policy of putting South and North Korea on 
the scales and to pursue the true worth. We can also be very 
helpful to Russia. We should be mindful so as to prevent 
impolite happenings from hurting our self-esteem as it 
repeatedly has happened every time there is a summit. 
  We have special interest in multifold diplomacy that 
President Kim Yong-sam will pursue after he visits all the four 
strong neighboring countries. We have been unilaterally 
influenced by neighboring countries throughout a long history. 
Now we have to grow up enough to influence our neighboring 
countries. This is not a mere illusion as long as diplomatic 
power is not in proportion to the size of the territory and 
population of a country.

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Song-su and Song Hyon-sung] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, June 2 (YONHAP) -- The most welcome result 
of the two-day South Korea-Russia summit was their establishment 
of close cooperation in handling the North Korean nuclear 
problem that is fast approaching a crisis level. Presidents Kim 
and Yeltsin reaffirmed that North Korea must abide by the 
inter-Korean agreement on denuclearization and that its nuclear 
program must be deterred. 
  During the first summit session Wednesday evening, Kim 
received a Russian promise of participation if the U.N. Security 
Council decided to impose sanctions on North Korea as a last 
recourse. Such pledges are reassuring, especially because 
Russia is one of the five permanent members of the Security 
Council and can still exert influence on North Korea. 
  The degree of sanctions Russia would support remained 
unclear, but Moscow's stance will certainly pressure China, 
which is the last remaining uncertain variable. 
  In a show of growing partnership, Kim and Yeltsin agreed to 
open a hot line between their offices for around-the-clock 
consultations on urgent situations including the North Korean 
nuclear matter. 
  The hot line, reserved previously for close security allies 
such as Japan and the United States, is symbolic of the 
transformation in bilateral relations that were once 
confrontational during the cold war days but are now based on 
mutual cooperation. 
  President Kim raised the issue of the North Korea-Russia 
Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, 
especially the clause in which Russia is obligated to 
automatically intervene on North Korea's side in case of war. 
He made clear that any supply of military equipment and 
technology to North Korea, which has not yet given up hope of 
national unification by force, is inappropriate. 
  Yeltsin suggested that a line has been drawn in 
Pyongyang-Moscow relations, explaining diplomatically that the 
treaty with North Korea is virtually dead in practice. 
  The summit cast light on future bilateral relations, the 
spirit of which was embodied in the 13-clause joint declaration 
released after Thursday's summit. The two presidents championed 
democracy and a market economy as shared values and vowed to 
build a relationship on these principles. 
  They accented cooperation in trade, science and technology, 
hoping to wed South Korea's industrial technology and experience 
in free competition with Russia's advanced science and natural 
resources. 
  Seoul-Moscow economic relations remain marred by the 
unrepaid 
South Korean loan to Russia. But Seoul officials decided to 
separate this issue from other economic projects and expect it 
will not get in the way of bilateral trade promotion. Further 
helping to thrust forward Seoul-Moscow ties, Yeltsin handed 
over, as promised, Russian documents on the 1950-53 Korean war 
in a gesture aimed at sweeping away the cold war past when 
Moscow had aided Pyongyang during the fratricidal clash. 
  Kim has now wound up his summit diplomacy with all four 
surrounding powers, with each providing confirmation of strong 
bilateral ties. 
  The summit with Yeltsin was no exception.

  [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- South Korea has decided to 
apply to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) this year. 
  The Finance Ministry held the first meeting of a 
working-level committee tasked with preparing for OECD 
membership, headed by Second Assistant Minister Sin Myong-ho, on 
Tuesday morning and decided that the Ministry will study OECD 
regulations in the third quarter and apply to join in December. 
  The 40-member committee will discuss Korea's bid to enter 
the 
OECD with related ministries, analyze its liberalization 
regulations and study the systems of present OECD member 
countries. 
  Earlier, Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong appointed four 
lawyers as consultants to do research and offer advice on legal 
aspects of the matter.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Yi Chang-sop] </F>
  [Text] Government officials and analysts are casting a 
suspicious eye at the role of the United States in Korea's 
run-up to entry to the Western well-to-do countries club of the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 
They suspect that Washington might seek to remote-control 
Korea's opening its markets and industries wider by taking 
advantage of Seoul's planned move to become an OECD member in 
1996. 
  Some government officials said that the United States might 
have two game plans in connection with Korea's OECD membership. 
One strategy would be to suspend the current bilateral trade 
talks and encourage Korea to join the OECD. Once Korea joins 
the OECD, the United States will pressure the OECD members to 
have Korea further open its markets, they said. 
  The other plan of the United States might be to intensify 
its 
pressure on Korea before its entry so that Seoul is forced to 
open its markets wider and wider. 
  A government official who wished to remain anonymous, said, 
"Washington has already read the Kim Yong-sam administration's 
political will to join the OECD during Kim's tenure." It will 
intensify pressure on Seoul to meet the guidelines, practices 
and rules that OECD countries maintain, he speculated. But he 
said that public sentiment will be in disfavor of Seoul's OECD 
membership if the United States is portrayed as playing a 
"behind-the-scene role" in opening the Korean market. The 
National Assembly will become vocal if lawmakers are persuaded 
that Washington is seeking to take advantage of the nation's 
OECD membership as an excuse to open Seoul's markets wider, he 
said. 
  The U.S. role will have a critical impact on the nation's 
view of the merits and demerits of joining the OECD, he said, 
adding that the best strategy for the United States would be "to 
take a wait and see attitude to Korea's membership negotiation 
with the Paris-based organization." It may be quite dangerous 
if the Korean people see the OECD membership as another Uruguay 
Round, he added. 
  Many working-level officials are still having second 
thoughts 
about whether the nation should be in such a hurry to join the 
OECD but in public, they say, "Korea must join the OECD. It is 
the commitment of President Kim Yong-sam." 
  The Ministry of Finance yesterday commissioned lawyers and 
economists to act as advisors on issues related to the nation's 
preparation to join. The MOF said Korea will initiate 
negotiations with the OECD in the latter half of next year for 
the nation's application for membership. 
  Seoul hopes that Korea will be given a full grace period to 
meet OECD requirements even after becoming a member. But if the 
OECD, egged on by the United States, is rigid in demanding Korea 
open its markets wider, there is a risk that Korean may be 
forced to delay the membership application at the later stage, 
government officials said. 
  They said, "It is a privilege for the OECD to have such 
fast-growing countries as Korea as its members." The OECD 
countries have lost their economic and political influence due 
to their slow economic growth, high inflation and uncontrollable 
trade deficits, they noted.

  [Text] Brussels, May 26 (YONHAP) -- The European Union (EU) 
Commission said Thursday it was considering whether to extend 
anti-dumping tariffs on video cassettes made in South Korea and 
Hong Kong that are due to expire in June. 
  The commission is investigating charges by the European 
Council of Chemical Manufacturers Federation (CEFIC), which has 
expressed concern that the two countries may continue to export 
their products at unfair prices in view of their ample 
manufacturing potential. 
  The CEFIC charges that Korean and Hong Kong video cassettes 
are sold at one-third the price of European products and that 
their dumping margins were actually greater than the 
anti-dumping tariff rates imposed. The EU has imposed punitive 
duties of 1.9 percent on Saehan Media, 3.8 percent on Sunkyong, 
2 percent on Kolon and 2.9 percent on Goldstar since June 1989. 
  Under the sunset provision, tariff imposition automatically 
terminates after five years unless the industry in the host 
country calls for an extension.

  [Text] Seoul, June 2 (YONHAP) -- The Foreign Ministry 
lodged a complaint Thursday against a European Union (EU) 
decision to withdraw Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) 
treatment for South Korean fabric products, calling it unfair 
abuse of the system. 
  "The government believes it was unjust for the EU to link 
the 
GSP issue with South Korea's introduction of an adjustment 
tariff and thereby expresses regrets," a Ministry official said 
in a commentary. 
  "The government points out again that GSP status, by its 
very 
nature, should not be used as a tool of countermeasure and urges 
the EU to repeal the decision," the official said. 
  The European Union finalized its decision Tuesday to halt 
GSP 
treatment for South Korean fabric goods from July 1 until Seoul 
withdraws its adjustment tariff on foreign products. 
  In January this year, Seoul introduced a 19-percent 
adjustment tariff on fabric imports for 1994 to minimize the 
impact on local firms caused by an unexpected inflow of foreign 
products. 
  South Korea stands to bear an additional 10.2-percent burden 
in customs tariffs on affected export items as a result of GSP 
withdrawal, totaling an estimated 5.8 million U.S. dollars. 
  Industry officials predicted that Korea will lose about 1.4 
million dollars in exports to Europe due to the EU measure.

<F P=106> [Article by Beijing-based correspondent Mun Il-hyon: "China </F>
Begins To Doubt North Korea--Why is China's Attitude on North 
Korea Stiffening?"] 
  [Text] Many recent indications show that China has changed 
its attitude on the North Korean nuclear problem. 
  When the UN Security Council adopted a presidential 
statement 
on 30 May, China promptly kept step with other Standing 
Committee member states and openly stated that its position is 
the same as that of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA]. This has not been observed in the past. 
  The current Chinese position on the North Korean nuclear 
problem is to support the denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula and to resolve the problem through dialogue between 
the parties concerned. China has not retreated even a step from 
these two principles since North Korea declared its withdrawal 
from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. 
  This being the case, the fact that China agreed, "without 
any 
hesitation," with the presidential statement of the Security 
Council containing a warning message against North Korea clearly 
shocked North Korea, which claims to be an ally with blood ties. 
  In a statement by its representative to the United Nations, 
China called for prompt resumption of negotiations with the IAEA 
and clearly expressed its official position for the first time 
that China is opposed to any act counter to the NPT. Thus, this 
can be interpreted as "direct pressure" on North Korea. 
  In the wake of the adoption of the presidential statement by 
the Security Council, China contacted the North Korean side many 
times and informed it of the view of the Standing Committee 
member states on the nuclear issue. 
  In addition, diplomatic sources in Beijing revealed that 
China urged North Korea to allow future measurement of fuel rods 
by stressing that sanctions would be inevitable in the event 
that North Korea does not accept the demand of the Security 
Council. 
  Such changes in the Chinese attitude was prompted by the 
fact 
that China's basic perception of the North Korean nuclear 
problem has changed. 
  When the first presidential statement of the Security 
Council 
was adopted on 31 March calling on North Korea to allow IAEA 
additional inspections, China expressed its firm conviction that 
North Korea does not possess nuclear weapons. 
  Because of North Korea's doubtful attitude, including the 
abrupt independent replacement of fuel rods in the five-megawatt 
reactor, China began to suspect that North Korea may be 
attempting to conceal its nuclear weapons development. 
Nevertheless, it is too early to believe that China will join 
the UN Security Council when its adopts sanctions against North 
Korea. 
  This is because Chinese participation in sanctions against 
North Korea will not only shake its relations with North Korea 
by their roots, but will also cause a great change in the 
balance of power in Northeast Asia. 
  This being the case, China must consider its relations with 
Western countries, including the United States, which extended 
China's most-favored-nation status. In particular, if China, an 
NPT member state, supports North Korea, which violates the NPT 
regulations, China will not only be inconsistent, but also will 
have to suffer serious confrontation with the United States, 
which is regarded as the "eldest brother" in the NPT system.

<F P=106> [By O Chae-suk] </F>
  [Text] Shanghai, May 29 (YONHAP) -- The just-ended visit to 
China by Rep. Mun Chong-su, secretary-general of the ruling 
Democratic Liberal Party [DLP], was a rare opportunity to enrich 
Sino-Korean relations that entered a higher realm following 
President Kim Yong-sam's official trip to Beijing last March. 
  Mun's six-day tour was scrutinized even more closely because 
it was the first high-level personnel exchange between the 
ruling parties of the two countries. 
  His visit could mean that bilateral relations, which had in 
the past been limited somewhat to exchanges of government 
officials and businessmen, have developed to the point of ruling 
party-level exchanges. Party-to-party exchanges with the Chinese 
are especially significant because in China the ruling Communist 
Party stands above the administration in terms of real power. 
  Naturally, Rep. Mun met key figures from the Chinese 
Communist Party to swap opinions on matters of mutual concern, 
such as promotion of bilateral ties and coping with the North 
Korean nuclear issue. It was through these contacts that the 
Chinese leadership was found to feel an acute need to resolve 
the nuclear question and play a positive mediatory role. 
  "Even for our economic development, for which we exert all 
available efforts, a stable and peaceful international situation 
is needed," said Hu Jintao, a member of the powerful Communist 
Party Secretariat who is regarded as one of China's 
next-generation leaders. Hu, who in effect oversees party 
affairs on behalf of President Jiang Zemin, told Mun that China 
is trying to help settle the nuclear dispute. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan conferred with Mun in an 
unscheduled meeting, confiding that his country had been 
advising Pyongyang to resolve the issue through dialogue and 
compromise. "We have already informed the United States and 
South Korea that North Korea, too, is interested in a peaceful 
resolution," Tang said. 
  Though no conclusive assurance was obtained, the two parties 
seem to have reached a tentative agreement on exchanging top 
party leaders in the foreseeable future. 
  "Since the two countries' relations are very good, I 
personally expect one of our senior leaders could visit Seoul 
before the end of this year," said Li Shuzheng, head of the 
Chinese Party's International Liaison Department. 
  Li made the remarks in the presence of Mun while seeing him 
off for Xian at the Beijing Airport. He is said to have 
conferred with Kim Il-song during a visit to Pyongyang last 
February. If a high-ranking leader actually visits Seoul, it 
could be either President Jiang, Premier Li Peng or a Party 
Standing Committee member, Li said. 
  South Korea's DLP originally hoped that a leading Chinese 
party official would reciprocate Mun's visit, followed by DLP 
Chairman Kim Chong-pil's trip to Beijing toward the end of the 
year. But the Chinese party has been circumspect about the 
matter, apparently in view of its half-century of amicable 
relations with the Workers' (Communist) Party of North Korea. 
  Mun's visit also showed that China attaches greater 
significance than Korea thought to the Seoul-Beijing summit last 
March. "We could confirm that with the summit as momentum, the 
Seoul-Beijing distance has narrowed significantly while 
Pyongyang's weight in Chinese foreign relations has been 
dwindling," said an official who accompanied Mun to Beijing.

  [Text] Seoul, May 27 (YONHAP) -- The Korea Development Bank 
will extend a 9.5-million-dollar credit to China to help finance 
a thermo-power project in Jiangsu Province, the bank reported 
Friday. A bank official said the credit will be part of the 470 
million dollars which the World Bank, JP Morgan of the United 
States and two other foreign banks in addition to KDB are 
providing to China. 
  "This is the first time a South Korean bank ever furnishes a 
credit to a project the central Chinese Government is directly 
undertaking," he said. 
  The credits, whose repayment is guaranteed by the World 
Bank, 
is repayable in 10 years after a grace of five years. The 
development bank will formally sign a credit agreement with the 
Chinese Government in Beijing on Sunday, the official added.

  [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's trade 
prospects have darkened with exports to China dropping last 
month for the first time since ties were normalized, the Bank of 
Korea [BOK] said Tuesday. 
  Exports to China totaled 1.76 billion U.S. dollars in the 
first four months, up just 11.5 percent from 1.58 billion 
dollars a year earlier. 
  The January-April growth is dwarfed by the 175.2-percent 
surge recorded in the same period last year. 
  Exports to the vast market grew 28.6 percent in January, 
20.5 
percent in February and 10.6 percent in March, then slipped 2.3 
percent in April. 
  Exports to China, a major contributor to Korea's trade 
balance, have slowed despite the continued popularity of most 
items because of a drop in two mainstays, cars and steel. 
  In the first four months of last year, 294.8 million dollars 
worth of cars were sold to China, 227 times more than a year 
earlier, but the volume plunged 94 percent to 17.8 million 
dollars worth this year. 
  With steel exports sinking 27.1 percent to 341.4 million 
dollars from 468.1 million dollars, the share of the two items 
in shipments to China fell to 20.4 percent from last year's 48.2 
percent. 
  Beijing's restrictions on imports to promote its own car 
industry since late last year explain the decrease in auto 
exports while steel shipments dropped due to a lack of stock for 
exports because of high demand at home and an easing of the 
construction boom in China. 
  Exports to China have surged since relations were normalized 
in August 1992, to the point of posting 94.1-percent growth last 
year. 
  However, Korea can no longer expect such growth due to 
sluggish exports of automobiles and steel products, BOK 
officials said. 
  As exports of other items are still going strong, posting 
growth of 71.5 percent in this period, shipments to China are 
expected to account for around 6 percent of total exports, close 
to last year's 6.3 percent.

  [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- The government has decided 
to send a 50-man medical unit to the West Sahara for about one 
year as part of the United Nations Peacekeeping Operations 
(PKO), the Defense Ministry said Monday. 
  At a cabinet meeting in the afternoon, the government 
decided 
to send a 20-strong advance team in early August if things go 
well after the National Assembly approves the decision. The 
main body is scheduled to be dispatched in mid-September, 
according to ministry officials. 
  The medical unit will replace a Swiss Medical Service Unit 
that has operated there since September 1992, establishing a 
central medical office in the Laayoune region where the West 
Sahara PKO (Minurso) headquarters are located. The ministry was 
asked by the United Nations to send a medical unit to the West 
Sahara last February, and it has since carried out a joint 
on-the-spot survey with the Foreign Ministry to report to 
related ministries. 
  The United Nations established the West Sahara PKO 
headquarters in September 1992. Currently, 490 people from 27 
countries are engaged in PKO activities, supervising the truce 
in the region and preparing a referendum. 
  The West Sahara was under the rule of the Moroccan royal 
family until 1884, when Spain colonized the region. As soon as 
the Spanish withdrew in 1976, the Moroccan Government claimed 
dominion over the region while the West Sahara Liberation Front 
sought independence, leading to a dispute.

  [Text] Viatel and USA Link, American international call 
service retailers, are engaging in unauthorized international 
phone services in Korea, the Communications Ministry said 
yesterday. 
  The ministry found the Viatel's service here was illegal in 
1992 when the American firm introduced the service. 
  The domestic law governing telecommunications service 
stipulates that the international call services shall be offered 
only by the public telecommunications service providers such as 
Korea Telecom and Dacom Corporation. 
  However, the U.S. firms resorted to clandestine services to 
bypass the outright violation, employing automatic collect call 
and call back systems, ministry spokesman Yi Chong-son said. 
  Such clandestine services are provided by Trans Pacific 
Service and Link Korea, the local agents of the U.S. companies. 
  The call retailers have subscribers place a call to the 
switching system, based in the United States, to get a return 
call from the destinations in the U.S., using the call back 
system. 
  When using the international toll free service method, 
subscribers dial a secret code and the destination number. They 
collect the fees by billing them on credit cards. 
  While taking advantage of U.S. rates which are lower than 
the 
domestic charge by 30 to 40 percent, the signals are identified 
as originating in the U.S., making it impossible to slap a 
surcharge on the services. 
  However, the service itself still illegal in that it uses 
domestic circuits without paying a fee, Yim Song-man, a director 
of international phone service of Korea Telecom, pointed out. 
  The connections by call back system even interfere with the 
ordinary Telecom services by crowding the lines, he claimed. 
  The subscribers are presumed to be business firms and U.S. 
servicemen who make frequent international calls, the official 
said. 
  "On the other hand, there is no way to dissuade customers 
from using the services, as the subscribers can not be 
identified," he said. "Even when they are identified, it is 
hard to secure evidence of the illegal service." 
  Though the market share of the firms remains at a meager 
level for now, they will further expand their service activities 
if left unchecked, he said. 
  Meanwhile, Viatel and USA Link reportedly claimed that their 
business cannot be subject to domestic law, because the 
switching actually takes place in the United States. 
  The ministry has delivered its complaints against the 
"illegal" business, but the response from the U.S. side was the 
Korea should lift the ban on the international call services by 
U.S. firms, instead, the ministry spokesman said. 
  "Because of concerns over possible retaliation by trade 
sanctions, the ministry could not take any action against their 
business," he confided. 
  So the ministry remains helpless in the situation with its 
hands tied, he added. 
  Spain and Japan have also undergone problems with such 
infiltrations by U.S. firms into the phone service market, he 
said. 
  To counter the low rates of the U.S. services, the ministry 
will study, with Korea Telecom and Dacom, lowering the domestic 
rates, he said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- South Korea ranked third 
behind Malaysia and Botswana among 114 countries that showed the 
most progress in human development between 1986 and 1992, 
according to an annual report by the United Nations Development 
Program (UNDP) obtained here by YONHAP Monday. 
  East Asian countries, including Korea, also recorded the 
fastest economic growth, with the report observing that "this 
shows that the fast pace of economic growth in East Asia was 
built on a solid foundation of human development." 
  The five-year human development report, published and 
distributed in eight languages throughout the world, aims to 
advance a new concept of human security and offers several 
concrete proposals for the world summit for social development 
in March 1995 in Copenhagen. 
  Canada ranked first in human development overall, while 
Barbados was No. 1 among developing countries. South Korea 
placed 32nd in the overall rankings and North Korea was 101st. 
  The other nations making up the top 10 in the global human 
development index [HDI], which ranks 173 countries according to 
life expectancy, educational attainment and basic purchasing 
power, are Switzerland, Japan, Sweden, Norway, France, 
Australia, the United States, the Netherlands, the United 
Kingdom and Germany, in descending order. 
  The new index shows that Korea, following Malaysia and 
Botswana, has made the most progress in human development since 
1960. 
  "They started from very low levels, but managed as a group 
to 
increase their HDI values by around 80 percent," says the report. 
  The other countries among the top 10 performers in human 
development since 1960 include Tunisia, Thailand, Syria, Turkey, 
China, Portugal and Iran. 
  The report notes that foreign aid to developing countries 
totaled 60 billion U.S. dollars in 1992, while 102 billion 
dollars in private capital flowed into the "South" that year 
compared to only 5 billion in 1970. 
  But nearly three-quarters of the capital went to just 10 
countries -- China, Mexico, Malaysia, Argentina, Thailand, 
Indonesia, Brazil, Nigeria, Venezuela and Korea -- while just 6 
percent went to Sub-Saharan Africa and 2 percent to the least 
developed nations. 
  Developing countries paid 160 billion dollars in debt 
service 
charges in 1992, more than two and a half times the official aid 
and 10 billion dollars more than private financial flows. 
  The report says that debt servicing is hampering developing 
countries' ability to meet urgent human development needs, and 
suggests cancelling the debts of the poorest nations in return 
for a pledge that they earmark those same funds for social 
development. 
  The 1994 report points out that widespread human insecurity 
is a universal problem -- the poor nations are more concerned 
about hunger and disease, while the rich states focus on drugs 
and crime. Thus the concern for human insecurity is global. 
  Nevertheless, spending to protect borders outstrips outlays 
to protect individuals within or across borders, the report 
notes. 
  Observing that several poor nations are spending much more 
on 
arms than on education and health, it charges that those 
encouraging the weapons trade in developing countries are 
responsible for the world's security policy -- the five 
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. 
  Saying the acquisition of more arms only aggravates existing 
human deprivations, the report lists China, India, Korea, 
Malaysia, Nigeria and Pakistan as recent buyers and explains how 
much it really costs them in terms of their unmet social agendas. 
  For example, Korea ordered 28 missiles from America, 
spending 
an amount that could have been used to immunize all of its 
120,000 unimmunized children and provide safe water to 3.5 
million people.

  [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
said on Tuesday "Our liberal democracy is an absolute value 
which we all should safeguard and cultivate under all 
circumstances." 
  In a statement issued in observance of the "month of 
veterans 
and fallen patriots" in June, President Kim said today's world 
situation following the demise of the Cold War expressly shows 
that "our belief in liberal democracy has been right." 
  He said the strength with which the precious value can be 
upheld would spring only from burning patriotism and firm senses 
of national security on the part of each people. "It is thanks 
entirely to the sacrificial dedication made by our fallen 
patriots and veterans that we today enjoy peace and prosperity 
in a free and democratic country," Kim said. 
  Also in an exclusive interview with the NAEWAY ECONOMIC 
DAILY 
[name of daily as received], President Kim said he would see to 
it that some public enterprises would be privatized in a just 
manner without any tint of suspicion. 
  Denouncing some industries for unfoundedly accusing rival 
firms in bids to grab public enterprises being privatized, the 
president said relevant offices are now working out a plan to 
forestall any by-products that may pop up in the course of 
privatization. 
  He said the government would enforce a plan to sharply 
improve the environment for foreigners investment within the 
first half of this year. The plan, he said, would involve all 
areas related to foreigners direct investment such as financing, 
taxation, labor and land use. 
  Touching on his upcoming official visit to Russia, President 
Kim said he hopes the tour would serve as an opportunity to 
further expand bilateral economic cooperative relations between 
the two countries. "During my visit, we will in particular try 
to remove various obstacles to free trade and investment and 
enhance practical cooperation in all areas," he said.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok is now increasing 
dialogue activities apparently aimed at expanding his sphere of 
influence. Since his inauguration, many have thought he would 
place more priority on "cabinet harmony" than on action, 
comparing him with his predecessor Yi Hoe-chang, who actively 
sought his share of the job as the second man in the 
administration. 
  Yi is now making "quiet waves." He is meeting as many people 
as possible. As part of this, he met low-ranking government 
officials over lunch about a week ago. And yesterday, he held a 
meeting to discuss ways to restore social dialogue in the wake 
of shocking murder of a mother and father by their son. 
  About a week ago, a millionaire Oriental medicine 
distributor 
and his wife were found stabbed and burnt to death at their home 
in southern Seoul. And to public shock, police announced 
Thursday that the murderer was their 23-year-old son. 
  In a government effort to find the out causes of the social 
malady represented by the malicious and cold-blooded, Prime 
Minister Yi Yong-tok held a meeting to discuss ways to restore 
social health. At the meeting, Prime Minister Yi stressed the 
need for preventive measures for the mental health of the 
younger generation, reminding the participants of the White 
House Conference on Youth and Education held 30 years ago in the 
United States. 
  "There are lots of causes making our youths mentally ill. 
There are the hell-like college entrance examination, human 
relations ridden by morbid egoism, moral cynicism, and unlimited 
competition," said the former pedagogue. 
  He analyzed that the murder was to be expected in a 
situation 
where deviation and pathological symptoms have already reached a 
dangerous point. "We must not hesitate any more. Efforts to 
heal the illness, however hard they may be, or even if they are 
nearly impossible, should be initiated right now," Yi 
emphasized. He called for the participants to pursue free 
discussion so that plans of what they should do and where they 
should begin to solve "the shocking problem" would emerge. 
  "I think the solutions which will be found in the process of 
this meeting will require efforts of individuals, family, school 
and society, and especially the share of the efforts taken by 
the government will be much larger," Yi said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 28 (YONHAP) -- Two splinter groups, the 
United People's and the New Political Reform Parties, have 
recently agreed in principle to merge and are likely to make an 
official announcement early next month. 
  The merger agreement came when the two parties' heads, Rep. 
Kim Tong-kil of the United People's Party (UPP) and Rep. Pak 
Chan-chong of the New Political Reform Party (NPRP), got 
together on Thursday. But they attached the condition that they 
would serve as joint representatives of the new party, informed 
sources said Saturday. 
  The UPP will convene its Executive Council Saturday 
afternoon 
to ratify the merger and begin discussions with the NPRP on such 
matters as the new party's name and reorganization of local 
chapters. 
  In addition, six independent lawmakers are reportedly poised 
to join the prospective party -- Reps. Yang Sun-chik, Yim 
Chun-won, Kim Chin-yong, Chong Tae-yong, Chong Chu-il and So 
Hun. If they were to join, it would be possible to organize a 
new parliamentary negotiating body with the incumbent 12 UPP 
lawmakers and Rep. Pak of NPRP being affiliated. 
  However, it was not known whether another splinter party, 
the 
new Korea Party, would also join as its head, Rep. Yi 
Chong-chan, is keeping mum on the merger. 
  As the two parties have agreed in principle to merge, 
chances 
of all opposition parties reaching a "grand union" with the 
Democratic Party as its central axis have become remoter, 
observers said. 
  A UPP official revealed, "we agreed in principle on a 
party-to-party merger after a series of contacts with the NPRP 
for the organization of a parliamentary negotiating group. If 
the issue of grand union of the opposition circles arises, we 
will think it over at that time."

  [Text] Seoul, May 29 (YONHAP) -- The United People's Party 
(UPP) and the New Political Reform Party (NPRP) will merge into 
one on Monday. 
  UPP leader Kim Tong-kil and NPRP leader Pak Chan-chong will 
have a joint press conference at the National Assembly Monday 
morning to announce their union. 
  Kim and Pak will say that their union does not mean giving 
up 
full-scale union of the opposition parties, but it is rather a 
first stage aiming at union of all the opposition parties in the 
future, including the main opposition Democratic Party and New 
Korea Party. 
  The unified party, whose name is not decided yet, will also 
try to admit independent lawmakers to be a formal negotiating 
body in the National Assembly. 
  Now UPP has 12 lawmakers and NPRP has one, so according to 
the rules of the National Assembly, the unified party will be 
able to be a negotiating body if seven lawmakers join it in 
addition.

  [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- The merger between two 
splinter parties announced Monday is expected to create a 
considerable power shift in the nation's political opposition 
camp. 
  Reps. Kim Tong-kil of the United People's Party and Pak 
Chan-chong of the New Political Reform Party held a news 
conference Monday and formally announced their parties' merger, 
which first became known last week. 
  It is not yet clear whether their merged party will be large 
enough to become a negotiating body in the National Assembly. A 
party is required to have 20 or more lawmakers in order to 
qualify as a negotiating group in the unicameral legislature. 
  At present, the United People's Party has 12 lawmakers and 
the new party for political reform has one -- Rep. Pak himself. 
  Addressing the issue of the new party's size, Kim Tong-kil 
said "a clearer picture" will emerge in a few days when current 
negotiations on bringing in independent lawmakers bear fruit. 
  If the new party managed to secure seven more lawmakers, it 
could upset the power balance that has existed ever since the 
inauguration of President Kim Yong-sam in February 1992 between 
the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) and the hitherto main 
opposition Democratic Party (DP). 
  Some political analysts are predicting there could be a 
further realignment of political forces. 
  Monday's announcement of the merger, expected to come in 
June, falls short of expectations for a grand merger of all 
opposition parties, for which "under-the-surface" negotiations 
have been going on since last year. 
  A merger of all opposition parties, to be built around the 
Democratic Party, has been envisaged by many but sources said 
the negotiations apparently failed because of the DP's 
"intraparty problems." 
  Monday's announcement, in a way, signifies that the main 
opposition Democratic Party has lost the initiative to form one 
large opposition group. 
  If the merged party became "large" by enticing independents 
into the fold, it would be much more difficult for the 
Democratic Party to unify all opposition forces under its 
leadership as the new party would demand a merger on equal terms. 
  In that event, the only possible path left for the DP to 
strengthen its status as the No. 1 opposition party will be to 
embrace Rep. Yi Chong-chan, chairman of the New Korea Party, and 
other prominent opposition politicians as individuals, analysts 
said. 
  In any event, the Democratic Party is likely to face 
considerable difficulties if it loses its label as the "only 
opposition force" -- at least in the National Assembly -- with 
the emergence of a second opposition party. 
  Realizing the precarious position they are in, many senior 
DP 
officials, especially those who had been advocating a grand 
opposition merger, were said to be urging the party to do some 
soul- searching, they said. 
  This, in turn, is expected to heighten factional discord 
within the party, they added. 
  Meanwhile, the ruling Democratic Liberal Party is watching 
developments and contemplating possible action should the newly 
merged party become a second opposition negotiating group. 
  DLP secretary-general Yi Han-tong told a meeting of senior 
party postholders Monday that the party should seriously study a 
possible tripartite setup in the assembly. 
  As part of the study, the DLP is understood to be 
contemplating wooing independent lawmakers who had bolted from 
the United People's Party earlier in order to prevent them from 
joining the merged party. 
  Among the independent lawmakers the new party is interested 
in embracing are Reps. Yang Sun-chik, Yim Chun-won, Pak Kyu-sik, 
Kim Chin-yong, So Hun and Chong Chu-il.

  [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic 
Liberal Party (DLP) is wooing independent lawmakers in a bid to 
impede the emergence of a new party large enough to become a 
negotiating body, DLP officials said Tuesday. 
  They said several independent lawmakers have expressed 
interest in joining the ruling party, suggesting that the DLP is 
currently selecting some for membership. 
  Two splinter parties -- the United People's Party (UPP) and 
the New Political Reform Party (NPRP) -- announced Monday they 
would merge and possibly become a third negotiating body in the 
National Assembly if they win over seven or more lawmakers. 
  Rep. Mun Chung-su, secretary-general of the DLP, said, "some 
nonpartisan lawmakers expressed the intention to enter our party 
long ago, but we cannot accept all of them." 
  He hinted that the DLP may select just enough independent 
lawmakers to deter the newly merged party from becoming a 
negotiating body. 
  He named Reps. Kim Chung-nam, Pyon Chong-il, Chong 
Mong-chun, 
Chong Tae-yong, Kim Chin-yong and Chong Chu-il as those who 
might be joining the DLP. 
  At present, the United People's Party has 12 lawmakers and 
the New Party for Political Reform has one. 
  If the new party managed to secure seven more lawmakers, it 
could upset the power balance that has existed ever since the 
inauguration of President Kim Yong-sam in February 1992 between 
the ruling DLP and the main opposition Democratic Party (DP).

<F P=106> [From the "Press pocket" column: "Drunken Lawmakers"] </F>
  [Text] The National Assembly Legislation-Judiciary 
Committee's hearing for investigation into the Sangmudae 
financial scandal Tuesday ended in a fuss caused by drunken 
lawmakers. 
  A dozen ruling and opposition party lawmakers attended a 
dinner hosted by Justice Minister Kim Tu-hui at a Japanese 
restaurant in Yoido during an intermission of the hearing 
Tuesday evening. The committee summoned the minister to hear 
testimony on the prosecution probe into the slush fund case on 
that day. 
  Among the lawmakers attending the dinner were committee 
chairman Hyon Kyong-tae, Reps. Ham Sok-chae, Chong Sang-chon, 
Kim Hyo-yong, Pak Hon-ki and Chong Chang-hyon of the ruling 
Democratic Liberal Party and Reps. Kang Chol-son, Chong Ki-ho 
and Na Pyong-son of the opposition Democratic Party. 
  At the dinner, lawmakers drank so much whisky that some of 
them were intoxicated all through the hearing which lasted till 
2 a.m. yesterday. Just after the dinner, Rep. Chong Ki-ho, 
quite drunk, went home to Chongju, Chungchong-pukto. 
  In the hearing which resumed at 10 p.m., 30 minutes behind 
schedule due to the party, Rep. Chong Sang-chon, whose face was 
glowing pink due to the influence of alcohol, interrupted 
questions of Rep. Chong Tae-chol of the DP, assailing him for 
improper use of legal terms. 
  The DLP lawmaker lashed out at Chong, who headed the DP's 
Sangmudae investigation team, for "billing a justice minister of 
a nation as a liar." The opposition lawmaker argued that 
Minister Kim was lying on the prosecution's tracing of checks 
issued by the Sangmudae contractor and the allegation that the 
money was funneled to the ruling camp during the 1992 
presidential election campaign. 
  Amid noisy protest from opposition lawmakers, chairman Hyon 
called the session into recess hastily. The hearing resumed 
after Hyon and Rep. Kang Sin-ok of the ruling DLP made apologies. 
  In the resumed hearing, Rep. Na of the DP, still 
intoxicated, 
made harangues whose topics ranged from a personal history of 
the disgraced Buddhist Chogye Order chief So Ui-hyon and a 
background story on the Buddha statue at Taegu's Tonghwa Temple. 
So had reportedly played a role of a political broker during 
past regimes. 
  As he rambled on, Na's fellow lawmakers stopped him and Rep. 
Kim Hyo-yong of the DLP, apparently disgusted, bolted from his 
seat and stalked out of the committee room. 
  Rep. Kang Su-rim of the DP later confessed that he could 
barely endure the air of the hearing room filled with smells of 
alcohol. "I advised my fellow lawmakers not to attend the dinner 
hosted by Minister Kim, but in vain," he added.

  [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- The Foreign Ministry has 
misappropriated "work-drive funds" and illegally issued 
passports, the Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI) said Monday. 
  In its recent audit of the Ministry, the BAI found that 
between June 1993 and March this year the Ministry used 186 
million won (about 230,000 U.S. dollars) in work-drive funds, 30 
percent of the 502 million won appropriated as such funds during 
the period, without the treasurer's prior approval and then 
notified the treasurer of such use up to 100 days later, the 
announcement said. 
  Moreover, the Ministry used 64 million won in work-drive 
funds to treat officials working overtime to special food, 
though the funds cannot be used to pay for food. 
  In addition, last year the Ministry issued, through overseas 
missions, passports to two citizens subjected to government 
administrative action for wrongdoings, which is in violation of 
the rules. The Ministry failed to advise the missions concerned 
of the information about the persons in question. 
  The BAI also found that the Ministry issued in December last 
year and February this year multiple-use passports to two 
citizens whose administrative action was temporarily suspended, 
though such citizens must be issued a single-use passport.

  [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- The joint 
military-prosecution investigation team, which probed the 
assassination of President Pak Chong-hui by then Central 
Intelligence Agency Director Kim Chae-kyu in October 1979, had 
found no evidence that then Army Chief of Staff and martial law 
commander, Gen. Chong Sung-hwa, was an accomplice in the 
slaying, a former team member testified recently. 
  Paek Tong-nim, 57, who served as chief investigator of the 
Defense Security Command and concurrently as a key member of the 
joint investigating team, told the prosecution that no concrete 
evidence of Chong's involvement had been detected in the course 
of probing the assassin Kim, according to a spokesman for the 
Seoul District Public Prosecutor's Office. 
  The joint investigation headquarters' announcement on Dec. 
24, 1979, charging Chong with high treason was based not on any 
concrete evidence but on what he did after after Kim killed Pak 
on the night of Oct. 26, 1979, Paek was quoted as saying. 
  The Seoul District Public Prosecutor's Office is looking 
into 
a criminal suit filed by the victims of the Dec. 12 "coup 
d'etat-like incident of the Army" against the perpetrators, 
including former Presidents Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u. Chong 
Sung-hwa is one of the victims. 
  Paek dismissed as "not true" then Defense Minister No 
Chae-hyon's statement on Dec. 13, 1979, that martial Law 
Commander Chong was arrested for interrogation because new 
evidence was discovered in the course of investigating the 
assassination. 
  The joint probe team felt the need to question Chong because 
when Kim killed Pak he was nearby and Prosecutor Chong 
Kyong-sik, a member of the joint team, called on the martial law 
commander at his office three times to question him about his 
actions on the assassination day, Paek was quoted as saying. 
  Paek said that without evidence supporting his involvement 
in 
the assassination and without then President Choe Kyu-ha's 
permission, the joint military-prosecution investigation 
headquarters, led by then Defense Security Commander Maj. Gen. 
Chon Tu-hwan forcibly arrested Chong, seemingly because of the 
headquarters' "political motive," suggesting that the Dec. 12 
incident was a mutiny by the "new military elite" to topple the 
government. 
  The prosecution is considering summoning lawyer Won 
Kang-hui, 
who as military prosecutor indicted Chong Sung-hwa on charges of 
abetting high treason, for questioning. 
  Won recently said there was no criminal evidence against 
Chong when he indicted him, adding the military prosecution then 
made "a different evaluation" of his actions on the 
assassination day. 
  The prosecution is expected to shortly conclude its probe 
into whether Chong was an accomplice in the slaying of Pak 
Chong-hui in October 1979.

  [Text] Seoul, June 1 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's net foreign 
debt has surged this year due to the rising trade deficit and a 
reduction in the flow of foreign capital into the domestic stock 
market, according to the Bank of Korea [BOK]. 
  The country's net foreign debt, tallied by excluding 
overseas 
assets from the total foreign debt, jumped to 8.7 billion 
dollars at the end of March from 7.87 billion dollars at the end 
of last year, a BOK report said Wednesday. 
  The report said the total foreign debt had increased 1.21 
billion dollars to 45.08 billion dollars as of March from 43.87 
billion dollars at last year's end, while the value of overseas 
assets rose just 380 million dollars from 36 billion dollars to 
36.38 billion dollars during the same period. 
  The net foreign debt dropped to 10 billion dollars last 
August from 11.1 billion dollars at the end of 1992, falling 
further to 7.71 billion dollars last November before starting to 
increase slightly afterwards. The upward trend has continued 
this year. 
  The surge was due to the widening trade deficit, which hit 
2,524 million dollars during the first quarter this year, the 
drastic reduction of foreign investment in the domestic stock 
market and the increase in short-term foreign debt, according to 
the report. 
  The amount of long-term debt with a repayment term of more 
than one year fell to 24.57 billion dollars as of the end of 
March from 24.71 billion dollars at last year-end, while the 
short-term debt with a repayment period of less than one year 
increased 1.35 billion dollars to 20.51 billion dollars from 
19.16 billion dollars during the same period, indicating the 
country's aggravated foreign debt structure, the report said. 
  The long-term debt decreased due to a government policy of 
curbing the introduction of long-term foreign loans for fear of 
a flood of incoming foreign money including stock investment 
capital, experts say. 
  The increase in short-term debt, meanwhile, can be explained 
by the government's efforts to ease various restrictions on 
foreign trade financing, including extension of the credit 
purchase period to 120 days from the previous 90 days starting 
Jan. 1, they say.

  [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's current 
account surplus for 1993 turned into a deficit starting in 
January and had worsened to 2.8 billion U.S. dollars by April, 
the Bank of Korea [BOK] said Monday. 
  Although improvement is likely in the latter half of the 
year, Korea is expected to run a deficit of around 3 billion 
dollars compared with last year's surplus of 453 million 
dollars, the central bank forecast. 
  April showed deficits of 178.5 million dollars in the trade 
and 103.8 million dollars in the invisible trade accounts, with 
the unrequited transfer surplus stopping at 24.4 million dollars 
to go 257.9 million dollars in the red on the current account. 
  Though last month's current account deficit was an 
improvement over the 672.3 million dollars in March, it was far 
larger than the 41.8 million dollars registered in April last 
year. Together with deficits of 1.4 billion dollars in January 
and 427.8 million dollars in February, the total reached 2.76 
billion dollars in April compared with 822.6 million dollars a 
year earlier. 
  Exports grew 10.7 percent in January-April but imports 
climbed 14.1 percent, resulting in a trade shortfall of 3.01 
billion dollars and an invisible trade deficit of 1.23 billion 
dollars. 
  Imports of capital goods like machinery and electronics rose 
21 percent, while those of consumer goods increased 16.2 percent 
due to a surge in cocoa (up 54 percent), knitwear (up 51.7 
percent) beef (up 44.5 percent) and electronic home appliances 
(up 38.5 percent). Companies importing for reserves due to shaky 
international raw material prices also fanned the import rise. 
  In the first four months of last year, imports for eventual 
export rose 9.8 percent while imports for domestic sale dropped 
8.6 percent due to recession: The former has inched up just 2.7 
percent while imports for home use soared 19.6 percent this 
year, however, proving that the spending habit is back. 
  A BOK official said the current account deficit is unlikely 
to grow further as it is gradually decreasing. But imports will 
probably continue to increase considering that international 
prices of raw materials, including oil, are on the rise. 
  Without radical export growth, the current account is likely 
to remain mired in the red. The good news is that the export 
unit price rose 0.4 percent in January-April while the import 
unit price dropped 3.6 percent, improving 4.2 percent the net 
trade terms that divide the former by the latter. 
  Net foreign fund inflow for stock investment dropped to 72 
million dollars from 909.9 million dollars a year earlier. The 
overall balance of payments combining the current and capital 
accounts thus showed a deficit of 227.7 million dollars for the 
first time in eight months, since the 136.1 million dollars 
recorded in August last year. 
  The January-April overall balance of payments totaled 333.9 
million dollars, far below the 2.14 billion dollars of the same 
period last year. Foreign currency holdings reached 21 billion 
dollars in April, up 260 million dollars from the previous month.

  [Text] Korea has concluded an accord on the terms under 
which it will borrow $2.34 billion from France for the 
construction of a high-speed railroad linking Seoul and Pusan. 
By obtaining concessions from Banque Indosuez, which will 
represent syndications to be formed for the loans, the Korean 
government will be able to lower finance costs by $170 million, 
the Ministry of Finance said yesterday. 
  In addition to low interest rates, the Ministry said, other 
terms such as debt-payment periods are favorable. 
  The accord on the terms of the proposed French loans to 
Korea 
was signed by Chong Tok-ku, director-general for economic 
cooperation at the Ministry, and M. Tabouis, senior vice 
president of Banque Indosuez, yesterday afternoon. 
  Korea and France are scheduled to sign an agreement on the 
French export and commercial loans in August this year after 
syndications are formed for the loans. 
  The annual interest rate on a $1,617 million loan to finance 
the French export of TGV supertrains to Korea has been lowered 
from the 7.28 percent level to 6.25 percent, the Ministry said. 
  The cut in the interest rate will save $150 million, the 
Ministry said. Added to this is $4.6 million saved from the 
reduction of the commitment fee from 0.325 percent of the loan 
per annum, which had been demanded by the French bank, to 0.28 
percent. 
  Korea has conceded to the French demand for a 0.4 percent 
management fee and a 1.2 percent insurance premium, the Ministry 
said. 
  The debt payment period will be 18 years, including an 
eight-year grace period during which the payment of interest 
will be deferred, the Ministry said. 
  The average interest rate on two commercial loans totaling 
$720 million, which the Korean Government will use to finance 
domestic purchases, will be 0.57 percent on top of the London 
Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), down from the 0.75 percent 
spread which had been demanded by the French bank. 
  This concession which Korea has obtained from the French 
bank 
will save $13 million, the Ministry said. 
  The Tranche A loan of $411 million, which will be paid back 
in 12 years, has a 0.55 percent spread on the LIBOR, down from 
the 0.625 spread demanded by the French bank. 
  The Tranche B loan of $309 million, whose debt-payment 
period 
is 15 years, has a 0.6 percent spread, down from the French 
demand for 0.875 percent. 
  The commitment and management fees will be 0.3 percent and 
0.7 percent per annum, respectively, as was demanded by the 
French bank. 
  "A commercial loan with a 15-year repayment period is 
unprecedented in the world financial market," said Chong of the 
Ministry. "In addition, the interest rates (of the Tranche A 
and B loans) are very low." 
  To secure concessions from the French Government, Chong 
said, 
Minister of Finance Hong Chae-hyong met with the French prime 
minister as well as his French counterpart when he visited 
France to attend the Asia Development Bank's annual meeting 
earlier this month. 
  Following Hong's talks with the top French officials, he 
said, negotiations on loan terms proceeded speedily. 
  "We expect the favorable terms we have obtained from France 
for the export and commercial loans will serve as a benchmark 
for Korean financial institutions planning to raise funds in the 
international financial market," he said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's exports of 
technology to foreign countries numbered 105 cases last year, a 
rise of 31.3 percent over 1992, and the money they fetched 
totaled 45,103,000 dollars, up 38.8 percent. 
  A Science and Technology Ministry official said on Tuesday 
the ratio of the country's technology exports to imports gained 
a little but it was still meager, 4.8 percent, last year. By 
region, technology transfer to Southeast Asian countries 
accounted for 91 percent of the total or 96 cases, of which 51 
cases or 48.6 percent of the total went to China. But, the 51 
cases transferred to China were worth only 10,295,000 dollars or 
22.8 percent of the total technology exports money in 1992. The 
official said most of the technology exported to China were low 
value-added and simple knowhow such as the ones on assemblage, 
processing and garment making. 
  Meanwhile, the ministry has authorized the Korea Industrial 
Technology Promotion Association to handle on its behalf paper 
work on technology exports by private industries effective June 
1 in an effort to reduce technology-exporting industries' burden.

  [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- South Korean businesses 
introduced 707 technologies from foreign countries last year, a 
32.6-percent increase over 1992, and paid 946.41 million U.S. 
dollars in return, a report said recently. 
  The turnaround in technology transfers, which had declined 
since 1989, reflects the business recovery in Korea, according 
to the "Annual Report on Technology Introduction" issued 
recently by the Korea Industrial Technology Association. 
  The annual report analyzed last year's technology 
introduction, finding that the electric and electronic sector 
led the way with 238 cases (33.6 percent), followed by 206 cases 
for the machinery area (29.1) and 91 cases for the chemical 
field (12.8). 
  In terms of royalties paid for technology transfers, the 
electric and electronic sector came first with 54.2 percent, 
trailed by the mechanical and chemical fields with 22.8 percent 
and 12.55 percent, respectively. The most conspicuous rise 
occurred in the construction sector with 28 cases worth 14.46 
million dollars compared with three cases totaling 7.35 million 
dollars in the previous year. 
  By country, Japan ranked first with 285 cases (40.3 
percent), 
followed by the United States (31.6 percent), Britain (5.15 
percent) and Germany (4.3 percent). 
  The report said Korea's reliance on American and Japanese 
technology declined as Japan, in particular, is avoiding 
transfer of its advanced technology. 
  However, technology imports from former communist countries 
such as Russia rose to 17 cases from five in the previous year, 
indicating that technical cooperation with these states is 
becoming more active.

  [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- The number of Taiwanese 
tourist arrivals here increased slightly during the first four 
months compared with the same period last year, with the two 
countries gradually restoring relations which have been strained 
since diplomatic ties were severed in 1992, according to the 
Korea National Tourism Corp. (KNTC). 
  A total of 51,600 Taiwanese visited South Korea from January 
to April this year, up 5.4 percent from 49,000 for the same 
period in 1993, according to a KNTC report released Tuesday. 
  The increase, although slight, contrasts sharply with the 
145,300 Taiwanese visitors to Korea in 1993 -- a 50.9-percent 
drop from the previous year's 296,000, the KNTC report said. 
  The KNTC report attributed the rise to an easing of 
anti-Korean sentiments among Taiwanese, which climaxed just 
after Seoul broke diplomatic ties with Taipei in favor of 
relations with the communist mainland in 1992. 
  Seoul and Taiwan have since been trying to resume bilateral 
relations, establishing liaison offices in Seoul and Taipei and 
expanding economic cooperation between businesses. 
  The KNTC also sent a delegation to Taipei early this year to 
promote "Visit Korea Year 1994," placing ads in the Taiwanese 
media. 
  Meanwhile, 36,500 South Koreans went to Taiwan during the 
first four months, a 56.7-percent increase from 23,300 during 
the same period in 1993, approaching the level reached before 
the severance of ties, according to the KNTC.

CSO 

  [Excerpts] The strong winds of the Uruguay Round [UR] talks 
concluded last December are bringing a great shock to our 
farming villages, and movements are vigorously arising to 
overcome this. These movements, being conducted in the direction 
of producing value-added products based on scientific 
agriculture, are here and there showing instances of success, 
injecting new hope into the depressed farm economy. 
  Started out of an understanding that only competitive 
products can survive, these new agricultural methods are 
characterized by aspects that are completely different from the 
past, for example, the adoption of advanced technology such as 
computers. They are drawing agriculture to a higher level by 
increasing productivity and competitiveness, and are aiming for 
high technology and high added value in agricultural products, 
just as is done with industrial products. Recently, in 
particular, this is not stopping at domestic markets, but 
instances are increasing of products making inroads into Japan 
and other foreign markets. This shows that these methods are 
readily capable of developing the present crisis into an 
opportunity for making great strides. 
  The agricultural sector being dealt the greatest blow 
following the conclusion of the UR talks is the rice market. 
With 4 percent of domestic consumption supposed to be brought in 
from foreign countries by 2004, it is predicted that the price 
competitiveness of domestically produced rice will fall 
dramatically, dealing a serious blow to farmers dependent on 
rice cultivation. 
  It is predicted that when the rice market opens in earnest, 
the price of domestic rice will fall, followed by reduced 
production, self-sufficiency, and farm-household income. The 
side effects will not be slight. 
  To stop the disintegration of the rice-farming household, 
high-quality rice must be produced at a low cost and brought to 
market. Considerable advances are being made in the first stage 
of this process, such as in species improvement for producing 
high-quality rice, and this brings hope. 
  The Rural Development Administration, the delivery room of 
our nation's agriculture, boasts that at present, in the 
quantity and quality of its rice, Korea is ahead of its 
competitors, Japan and the United States. Developed in 1991, 
Grade-I Rice, in particular, is assessed to be vastly superior 
to Japan's "Koshirikari" and America's "Calrose," which have 
been known to be of good quality, with a good taste as well as 
clear, clean grains. 
  The Rural Development Administration was also successful in 
developing other new kinds of rice, such as "Suwon--No. 387," 
"Suwon--No. 393," and "Miryang--No. 115." Presently going by 
their test names, it appears that these types of rice, if 
supplied to normal farming households, will further heighten 
competitiveness, at least as far as quality goes. 
  In charge of rice-quality development is the research team 
of 
the Rural Development Administration's Crop Testing Center. With 
a total of 31 members devoting themselves to research, this team 
has for the last ten years applied genetic engineering, and so 
on, toward developing two to five new species every year. 
  Of these, "Grade-I Rice," "Changan Rice," "Odae Rice," 
"Tongjin Rice," and "Mangum Rice," supplied since 1990, are 
strategic species capable of dealing with the opening of markets 
to imports. The research team will soon come out with "Hyangmi," 
whose grains give off a pleasant smell; "Taerimmi," whose grains 
are more than twice as large as normal rice; and "Yusaengmi," 
whose grains contain various colors. 
  "We are developing various new species based on the over 
21,500 species of rice now stored at the seed bank," says Mun 
Hon-pal, director of the Crop Testing Center's Lowland Rice 
Breeding Division. Expressing confidence, he said, "I believe 
that in quality, Korean rice is already securing international 
competitiveness." 
  Besides this, concerning the 13 items to be opened for 
import, such as cereals, miscellaneous grains, and flowering 
plants, the Crop Testing Center seed bank has secured over 
11,000 kinds of seed and is increasing efforts to develop 
high-quality species. 
  Competitiveness in the rice market is not obtained with 
quality alone, however. The most important task faced at present 
is lowering the price of rice, some three times higher than 
American rice, to a competitive level. For this, it must be 
backed by agricultural technology and government policy 
targeting low production costs and high production power. There 
will be considerable difficulty in accomplishing this, say Rural 
Development Administration officials. 
  "More than anything else, an expansion of agricultural land 
is needed to make possible large-scale mechanized agricultural," 
says researcher Yun Yong-tae, stressing, "The backing of 
government policy is urgently needed for the reclamation of farm 
land, which requires the investment of massive project costs." 
  Efforts to find a way of escape, and swimming out of the 
rough seas of the UR are particularly lively at the private 
level. Instances are appearing a few at a time of the 
development of new products mobilizing all kinds of ideas, of 
facilities conceived and operated to reduce production expenses, 
and even of products making inroads into foreign markets. 
[passage omitted] 
  More than anything else, the government and the public need 
to have a new understanding of agriculture, and farmers too must 
cultivate a self-renewing capability by developing agricultural 
methods in keeping with the times. 
  In connection with this, Ho Sin-haeng, former agriculture, 
forestry, and fisheries minister, says, "First of all, the 
administration must present a mid- and long-term blueprint with 
a good understanding of farming and farming communities." He 
stresses, "Containing the administration's strong will to carry 
out its policies, it must be capable of inculcating in farmers a 
motivation to produce." 
  "There must be reform in agricultural education and other 
areas for raising a specialized workforce. Market reform for 
price stability must be realized along with it," he says, 
adding, "Farmers too should conduct one-village-one-product 
campaigns, campaigns to create local specialty production 
complexes, and so on, enabling themselves to be independent in 
the long run."

  [Text] The Japanese and U.S. Governments have decided to 
cooperate in building next-generation communications networks. 
The two countries have agreed to include telecommunications as 
a "cooperation sector" in Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. 
  A Japan-U.S. roundtable on telecommunications policy may be 
set up in September to start work on standardizing advanced 
communications and broadcasting systems and equipment. 
  There have been forums at the governmental level on this 
subject between Europe and the United States, or between Japan 
and Europe -- for instance, the "Japan-Europe Telecommunications 
Forum" -- since the beginning of the 1990's. The start of the 
planned consultations between Japan and the United States will 
practically expand international cooperation in 
telecommunications into a trilateral framework. 
  The "cooperation sectors" in the framework talks, unlike the 
sector-by-sector negotiations which deal with bilateral economic 
friction, refer to sectors where the two countries will promote 
cooperation from a global perspective. This includes such 
issues as environment and population, and telecommunications has 
been included as one sector under commercial technology. 
  A concrete step in bilateral telecommunications cooperation 
is the standardization of next-generation communications and 
broadcasting systems and equipment. The two countries are 
presently working on a number of large-scale projects to build 
next-generation communications networks, including the Global 
Information Infrastructure (GII), the National Information 
Infrastructure (NII) of the United States, domestic networks for 
Japan, and the Asian Information Infrastructure (AII). 
Standardizing systems and equipment used in these projects will 
facilitate mutual participation of companies from both countries 
and prevent bilateral friction. 
  Furthermore, standardization of equipment will enable mass 
production to cut costs, and will give the two countries a 
technological advantage in similar projects in other regions. 
  In discussions on communications cooperation, the Ministries 
of Posts and Telecommunications and Foreign Affairs will be the 
government offices in charge on the Japanese side, while the 
Departments of Commerce and State, the Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC), and the Office of U.S. Trade Representative 
(USTR), and others will participate on the U.S. side. 
Telecommunications and broadcasting companies, and 
communications equipment makers will also be invited to 
participate when necessary. 
  Cooperation in telecommunications was suggested by Prime 
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to President Bill Clinton during the 
Japan-U.S. summit in April 1993, and the President agreed to the 
proposal. However, the United States postponed discussions due 
to the intensifying economic friction. The two countries now 
plan to begin preparatory meetings in early June, and hold the 
first official meeting around the time of the plenipotentiaries' 
meeting of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in 
Kyoto from mid- September to early October. 
  Since inauguration of the Clinton administration, the U.S. 
Government has given much emphasis to information policy. Apart 
from working on building a national information network under 
the NII program, it proposes building an international computer 
communications network under GII. On the other hand, the 
Japanese Government has proposed the AII program covering the 
Asian countries. It has started to invite Asian countries to 
get involved in this plan by sounding out the ROK government on 
possible participation in early May. Japan and the United 
States want to accelerate building the infrastructure for the 
multimedia age by promoting information policy coordination.

  [Text] It was learned on 27 May that during negotiations 
on the resumption of the framework trade talks, the United 
States rejected a Japanese definition of objective criteria. 
This was learned when the draft agreement drawn up by Japan was 
compared with the final agreement on the resumption of the trade 
talks, which was disclosed on 27 May. The Japanese Government 
has so far evaluated the results of the negotiations highly. A 
government source said: "It is now clear that objective criteria 
are not numerical targets." But after the details of the 
negotiations were disclosed, the same government source 
expressed concern, saying: "Washington will interpret objective 
criteria as something similar to numerical targets." Another 
government source said the Hata administration, which is in a 
precarious position, "might have given priority to `reopening' 
the trade talks in an attempt to earn diplomatic points to 
strengthen its power." 
  A government source who participated in the recent 
unofficial 
negotiations with Washington considers the final agreement to be 
advantageous to Japan. Stressing that the demand for setting 
numerical targets was averted, he said: "Japan is not bound by 
numerical targets and will not be criticized [for not achieving 
such targets]." 
  However, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, a top Japanese 
negotiator in the talks with the United States, said: "Although 
objective criteria are not numerical targets, Washington will 
put forward a demand very similar to that for setting numerical 
targets." As such, there is strong concern about Washington's 
future moves. Japan and the United States have agreed that 
objective criteria should be defined as "qualitative and 
quantitative standards." A government source expressed concern 
that Washington might give much weight to quantitative 
yardsticks, saying: "In sectorial trade talks, Tokyo and 
Washington will argue over what quantitative yardsticks should 
be, whether they should use total trade volume or market shares 
as yardsticks. Each side will try to adopt benchmarks 
advantageous to itself." 
  Some government officials are critical of the recent 
agreement. One official said: "Although trade is a two-way act, 
the recent agreement includes only demands on Japan and makes 
few references to what the United Stats should do." 
  Both Japan and the United States have reasons for having 
made 
the hasty agreement. President Bill Clinton needs to promote 
cooperation with Asia, because there is criticism within his 
administration against his Asia policy. Meanwhile, the Hata 
government has to take some measures to strengthen its power. 
  A government source said: "It is highly possible that in the 
resumed talks, the two countries will again confront each other 
over objective criteria. It is very questionable to say that it 
was right for Japan to have made that heavy concession."

<F P=106> [Message from King Norodom Sihanouk to his subjects; date </F>
not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] My respects to both supreme patriarchs, to Samdech 
Preah Pouthiveang, Samdech Preah Khousananda, and Samdech Preah 
Mongkol Teppeacha [superior monks], and to the rest of the 
Buddhist clergy; my respects to all my beloved compatriots, old 
and young alike. I would like to inform you that the 
inter-Cambodian conference known as the roundtable in Pyongyang, 
the DPRK -- Cambodia's great friend -- has ended and has 
produced the following results: 
  1. His Excellency [H.E.] Samdech Chea Sim, H.E. Samdech Hun 
Sen, H.E. Khieu Samphan, His Royal Highness [HRH] Prince 
Krompreah Norodom Ranaridddh, and myself -- the five of us 
responsible for solving problems for Cambodia -- agreed to 
always be true and always be loyal to the principle that we will 
do our best to create conditions for securing peace and security 
for our Cambodian people, nation, and motherland. Our people 
have suffered for more than 20 years now. They are in urgent 
need of a cease- fire, of peace. Therefore, we must do our best 
to restore peace and fully realize national reconciliation. 
Furthermore, we will always be loyal to the sacred principle 
that the country must be free from partition or secession; it 
must not be divided into three, four, or more parts. We must 
preserve the territorial unity and territorial integrity of 
Cambodia forever. We must preserve the land and maritime 
borders of an independent, neutral, and nonaligned Cambodia 
which existed from 1963 to 1969 and which were solemnly 
recognized by the international community. 
  Therefore, we must defend these borders, this 1963-69 
territorial integrity and must do all we can so that all 
countries in the world respect these land and maritime borders. 
In order to do that we must achieve national unity, we must 
regard one another as members of the same family and avoid 
polarization. For this reason, the Pyongyang roundtable 
unanimously agreed that although Cambodia's overall problems, 
such as the problem of war, are not yet settled to a 
satisfactory extent, we must carry on the talks between the 
Royal Government of Cambodia and the party of Democratic 
Kampuchea. Consequently, the Pyongyang roundtable decided that 
in June 1994 another roundtable will be held at Damnak Chan in 
the Phnom Penh Royal Palace. This roundtable will be a meeting 
of representatives of H.E. Samdech Chea Sim, H.E. Samdech Hun 
Sen, H.E. Khieu Samphan, HRH Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh, and Norodom Sihanouk. The five representatives will 
come to the Royal Palace on 15 June, continue the work left over 
from Pyongyang, and see to it that there will be progress in the 
search for a solution to all problems, such as the problem of 
war. 
  I would like to inform all of you, venerable monks and 
beloved compatriots, that I Norodom Sihanouk am affected with 
cancer of the bone marrow, an illness for which I did not 
receive any treatment during the two months that I was having 
the honor to serve my people, my country between our traditional 
new year and the day I left home in May. During this time that 
I was serving the people, the nation, and the motherland, I was 
very tired every day and I did not receive any thorough medical 
examination from my Chinese doctor to see whether the cancer had 
recurred. The Chinese doctor was worried that my overwork and 
lack of proper medical treatment -- as the one I received in 
Beijing -- would cause a relapse. The Cambodian and French 
doctors in Phnom Penh took three samples of my blood for 
examination. The results of my blood test were not good. It 
showed that I still had this cancer and a few other afflictions 
in my system. Therefore, I needed to return promptly to the 
Chinese hospital in Beijing. 
  However, because we also needed to hold the roundtable to 
bring peace for our people and end their sufferings, I made the 
ultimate sacrifice. As a result, my future was not bright and I 
might become very sick and might even die. Although I was 
experiencing a health problem, I agreed to make the sacrifice 
and I did not recoil from personal discomfort when I had to work 
relentlessly in the past few days. Why did I agree to all of 
that? It was so that our nation can live in peace, ridding 
itself of sufferings and fear caused by war. 
  It is most regrettable to me that the delegation of 
Democratic Kampuchea or Khmer Rouge headed by H.E. Khieu 
Samphan to the roundtable did not agree with the Royal 
Government and the National Assembly. 
  Our Royal Government represented by HRH Prince Krompreah 
Norodom Ranariddh and H.E. Samdech Hun Sen and our National 
Assembly represented by H.E. Samdech Chea Sim, as the chairman, 
fully accepted the king's proposal, that is, an immediate 
cease-fire or, failing that, a permanent cease-fire as of 15 
June when the war, the fighting must end without any conditions. 
They also agreed to study with the Khmer Rouge ways to include 
them into our Royal Government. They agreed to see whether our 
Royal Government can accept the Khmer Rouge leaders as 
ministers, deputy ministers, or secretaries of state. A number 
of Khmer Rouge leaders are thus to be included into the Royal 
Government and the Khmer Rouge army known as the National Army 
of Democratic Kampuchea is to be integrated into the Khmer Royal 
Armed Forces. 
  In this undertaking, I hoped that Pyongyang with its 
excellent atmosphere and calm would be a perfect venue for us to 
hold the discussion. I hoped that we would have sufficient time 
to solve the problems to stop the war, end the Khmer Rouge 
secession, and include some Khmer Rouge leaders, such as H.E. 
Khieu Samphan and H.E. Chan Youran, into the Royal Government. 
  However, the Party of Democratic Kampuchea leaders did not 
agree with the proposal of the King of Cambodia Norodom 
Sihanouk. They proposed a method of supervision that is 
different from what Norodom Sihanouk had suggested. They wanted 
to invite five foreign countries. They asked the royal 
government to pick five countries from the 10 they had selected 
to come and oversee the cease-fire. However, the cease-fire 
cannot be implemented if the problem of a new government, 
meaning the formation of a new Cambodian Government whose power 
is jointly shared by them, has not been resolved. If the 
problem is not completely solved according to their desire, they 
will not stop fighting. Therefore, the talks will run aground 
because of the Khmer Rouge's demand for foreigners to monitor 
the cease-fire. 
  Somehow, when foreigners came during the time of UNTAC [UN 
Transitional Authority in Cambodia], the Khmer Rouge did not 
allow them do any overseeing. They also endangered UNTAC and 
even caused the death of some UNTAC members. Now, they have 
changed their words, saying 10 UN members -- they did not talk 
about the United Nations, but 10 countries which are all full 
members of the United Nations -- should be invited and that five 
of them should come. However, it would take a long time for them 
to answer yes or no if we were to ask them. It might take 
months or even a year to solve the problem of cease-fire 
supervision. Our people will continue to suffer endlessly. 
Even if these countries say they will come, I still do not 
believe they would. I am sure they will not come. They said 
they had bitter experiences while they were under UNTAC in 
Cambodia. UNTAC told them the experiences with Khmer Rouge were 
most bitter. At that time, the Khmer Rouge did not respect 
UNTAC, but now they said they need foreigners to come and 
oversee Cambodians. The Khmer Rouge can never be trusted. That 
is what these countries said. 
  I wish to clarify that when the five countries are allowed 
to 
come and oversee us, it does not mean that the Khmer Rouge will 
agree to stop the war. They will continue to fight; they will 
agree to stop only if the existing government dissolves itself, 
contrary to the Constitution. They will do whatever they can to 
bring to existence a new government through which they can exert 
control in the areas of state affairs, the state, the country, 
and the nation with Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh of 
FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, 
Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] and H.E. Chea Sim and H.E. 
Hun Sen of the Cambodian People's Party. At least, power should 
be given to them equally, though they did not take part in the 
elections. H.E. Samdech Hun Sen has disagreed with that. He 
said that is against the Constitution and that the sacrifices of 
the voters will be futile and meaningless. Therefore, he 
remained in disagreement at the roundtable meeting in Pyongyang. 
That how the talks turned out. 
  I am no longer able to solve this problem. So, I have asked 
H.E. Samdech Chakkrei Nhoek Chulong, who is now over 86 years 
old and trusted by various parties, to go to Phnom Penh. He is 
staying with me now in Pyongyang and will travel to Phnom Penh 
to represent the king as the chairman of the roundtable meeting 
to be held in the Royal Palace on 15 June 1994. This is what I 
would like to tell the clergy. 
  Anyway, we hope that there would be some good results on 
15-16 June. But, is our optimism reasonable? From what I know 
about the Khmer Rouge, I have little hope. Nonetheless, the 
Triple Jewel will not forsake us, the supreme patriarchs and 
clergy will not abandon us. Their teaching about compassion, 
nonviolence, and national reconciliation will one day help 
Cambodia, allowing it to regain peace, security, full 
independence, neutrality, and territorial integrity within its 
borders recognized during the Sangkum Reas Niyum era prior to 
the coup d'etat staged by Lon Nol and Sirimatak. Therefore, I 
wish to call on the clergy to further support the talks so as to 
allow our people, who have suffered in the extreme, to again 
live in peace. We will join hands to rebuild our nation and 
motherland toward glory. 
  As revered Marshall Kim Il-song, president of the DPRK, said 
yesterday: After you leave here, Cambodian brothers, please 
compromise before it is too late to reestablish peace for the 
people, nation, and motherland. Peace should be taken as 
national reconciliation and reunification, the basis for 
rebuilding the Cambodian nation and motherland toward prosperity 
and glory. This will allow Cambodia to catch up with other 
countries that are developing, while it is regressing due to 
division and war. Therefore, division and war should be put to 
an end. You should achieve peace and national reconciliation 
and reunite around your king to rebuild the nation, and permit 
it to catch up with other developed countries in this modern 
world. This is most valuable advice. Therefore, the PDK 
leaders -- including H.E. Khieu Samphan and his delegation -- 
who heard this statement with their own ears at Marshal Kim 
Il-song's palace yesterday, please heed this advice in a timely 
fashion. Please help our nation so that it can survive like 
other countries, and prevent it from vanishing in the future. 
  This is the end of my impromptu message. When the royal 
government delegation bade farewell to me before returning to 
Phnom Penh, I hurriedly recorded this message for the 
information of all of you. Thank you very much. 
  I pray that the Triple Jewel, previous Cambodian kings, and 
goddesses will protect all of you. May you enjoy longevity, 
social prestige, happiness, strength, and enlightenment. And 
may our Cambodia and respected and beloved people recover peace 
in the near future. Thank you very much.

  [Text] Indonesia appreciates the Philippine Government's 
handling of the Manila conference on East Timor. The conference 
is taking place after the Philippine Supreme Court overruled a 
lower court's ban on the conference. Only Filipinos are 
attending the conference, however, after the Philippine 
Government exerted various effective efforts to bar foreigners 
from attending the conference. 
  According to a press release from the Directorate for 
Foreign 
Information of the Department of Foreign Affairs received by RRI 
[Radio Republik Indonesia] this evening, the Philippine 
Government has also given assurances that the conference is not 
being used as a platform to launch a campaign of lies or an 
international disinformation campaign against Indonesia. In 
this connection, Indonesia respects the sovereignty of other 
countries and the right of their citizens to hold debates.

  [Text] Thailand will be affected by a 30.5 percent 
reduction in ceilings proposed by the United States under its 
Generalised System of Preferences [GSP] tariff-reduction 
programme. 
  The current GSP eliminates import duties on products shipped 
to the United States from developing countries, up to a ceiling 
of $108 million a year per product. 
  Under the new programme, the ceiling will be $75 million a 
year. 
  The new GSP will be extended for 10 years from October 1, 
1994 to September 30, 2004. While the initial ceiling will be 
$75 million based on 1995 figures, the figure will increase by 
$5 million a year. 
  A Business Economics Department source said three Thai 
products shipped to U.S. markets in 1993 exceeded the new 
ceiling: automotive wiring, $116.97 million; computer equipment, 
$98.49 million, and microwave ovens, $77.45 milllon. 
  The source said the one benefit to Thailand is that the new 
GSP programme will not link environmental concerns to 
qualification tariff preferences. 
  However, the programme may be withdrawn earlier than the 
2004 
deadline if the World Bank identifies a recipient country as 
having achieved a per capita annual income of more than $7,900. 
  The first GSP programme from 1976-84 was designed to help 
developing countries gain access to U.S. markets without any 
conditions. 
  Under the second programme which expires at the end of 
September, the extension of preferences depends on the 
development level of exporting countries. 
  Recipient countries are also required to open their goods 
and 
services markets to American firms, protect U.S. intellectual 
property rights and meet international labour-rights standards. 
  Kanitson Nawanukhro, deputy director-general of the Business 
Economics Department, said a U.S. Congressional subcommittee has 
recommended that the new GSP programme be ready for Congress at 
the same time as ratification of the Uruguay Round of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

  [Summary] "Dear friends: After their morning group 
discussions, National Assembly deputies worked in the conference 
hall this afternoon and debated the revised draft law on the 
organization of people's councils and people's committees. The 
afternoon session was directed by National Assembly Chairman 
Nong Duc Manh." 
  All of the fourteen deputies who spoke at the session agreed 
with the views of the law drafting committee. They pointed out: 
"In view of the demands arising from the renovation process and 
in compliance with the 1992 Constitution, the amendment of and 
supplement to this law are regarded as a pressing and necessary 
requirement as the term of office of people's councils at 
various levels will expire by November 1994." 
  The deputies concentrated their discussions on the following 
major issues: 
  -- Term of office of people's councils at various levels. 
  -- Duties and powers of people's councils, of people's 
councillors, and of people's committees. 
  -- Whether people's committee chairmen should be people's 
councillors?, and so forth. 
  "Many deputies who spoke proposed that the term of office of 
people's councils at various levels should be five years and 
that people's councils should meet three times a year. They 
said it would be too much of an interval if people's councils 
meet only twice a year." 
  Many deputies called for more attention to the role of the 
Fatherland Front Committees at various levels in the activities 
of people's councils. 
  As for Article 24 and Point 4 of Article 33 on how people's 
councils should resolve complaints and denunciations, many 
deputies called for more specific stipulations on the powers of 
people's councillors and people's council standing members with 
regard to this matter. 
  With regard to the question of whether people's committee 
chairmen should be people's councillors, "may deputies spoke in 
favor of the idea that people's committee chairmen will not 
necessarily be people's councillors." 
  "Tomorrow, National Assembly deputies will continue to meet 
at the conference hall to discuss a revised draft law on the 
organization of people's councils and people's committees."

<F P=106> ["U.S. Military Option Can Never Be Justified" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
lambastes the bellicose outcries of U.S. hardline conservative 
forces driving the situation on the Korean peninsula into 
extremes. 
  U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry recently took issue 
again with the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. Talking about a 
"critical situation" which might be created in case "sanctions" 
are taken against the DPRK, he ordered a foreward deployment of 
the extra- large aircraft carrier in a place where it can launch 
into an operation on the Korean peninsula in a few days. 
  Meanwhile, U.S. Senator McCain called for deploying 
additional U.S. forces in South Korea and exercising "military 
strength," arguing that the peaceful nuclear program of the DPRK 
was a "threat" to U.S. security. 
  The daily brands this as a criminal move to commit an 
adventurous military action against the DPRK over the "nuclear 
issue." 
  The news analyst says: 
  A few days ago, the spokesman for the International Atomic 
Energy Agency and the official of the White House in charge of 
national security said they believed the DPRK did not divert 
nuclear fuel to other purposes. 
  Nevertheless, the U.S. hardline conservatives describe the 
DPRK's nuclear program as a "factor of threat to the U.S. 
security." This is a reversed logic of a brigand. 
  It goes without saying that this is an intrigue to justify 
their attempt at isolating and stifling the DPRK, branding it as 
"nuclear criminal." 
  It does not make sense at all that the DPRK which has no 
nuclear weapon and is engaged only in peaceful nuclear 
activities poses a "threat" to the United States far away across 
the ocean. 
  To talk about "threat to the United States" from the DPRK is 
as shameless as a murderer accusing the victim of a crime. 
  The campaign of the U.S. hardline conservative forces is a 
despicable and vulgar act aimed at raising the prestige of the 
U.S. military by deliberately aggravating the situation on the 
Korean peninsula and getting reward for their service for the 
arms trade of U.S. munitions monopolies. 
  With nothing can the United States justify its military 
option. 
  We are not afraid of any "military strength" and will 
sternly 
counter it.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The U.S. Imperialists Are the Criminals </F>
Who Are Encouraging the Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons"] 
  [Text] As a needle in a sack still pierces, it can no 
longer be possible to hide the fact that the United States is 
the mastermind of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
  As has already been reported, the SANKEI SHINBUN carried on 
18 May an article entitled "The United States has Exported 
Nuclear-Related Equipment to Eight Countries Suspected To Be 
Engaged in Nuclear Development--There Is Even Criticism This 
Violates the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]." The 
article quotes a 17 May report by the General Accounting Office 
[of the United States] that the United States had exported more 
than 1,500 pieces of material and equipment, which can diverted 
to the production of nuclear weapons, to various countries, 
including Israel, from fiscal year 1988 to 1992. This is a very 
grave development of the situation, which can make the NPT 
itself a scrap of paper, and is an intolerable criminal act that 
can arouse a high degree of alertness from the international 
community. 
  Until now, as a signatory of the NPT, the U.S. imperialists 
have said that they are prohibiting the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons. In reality, however, this is a falsehood and it has now 
been fully disclosed that the United States is none other than a 
criminal state that is encouraging nuclear proliferation. 
  As everyone knows the NPT stipulates that signatories cannot 
hand over equipment that can be used for the production of 
nuclear weapons--including nuclear weapons, of course, or other 
nuclear explosive devices--to other countries. This 
notwithstanding, the U.S. imperialists have not only 
indiscriminately exported materials and equipment necessary for 
the production of nuclear weapons to various countries, while 
ruthlessly violating the NPT, but also turned South Korea into 
the Far East's largest nuclear powder magazine by introducing 
about 1,000 nuclear weapons into South Korea alone. 
  In addition, recently the U.S. imperialists have continued 
introducing numerous lethal weapons, including Patriot 
missiles--weapons of mass destruction--and assault helicopter 
Apaches, into South Korea, and mobilized them in the area along 
the military demarcation line, thereby running wild in 
preparations for a nuclear war. 
  Such acts by the U.S. imperialists are creating a big 
obstacle to building a nuclear-free world and are seriously 
threatening the existence of mankind. 
  This clearly shows that the U.S. imperialists are the 
masterminds who are encouraging the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons and the basic source of nuclear calamity upon mankind. 
  What cannot be overlooked is the fact that the U.S. 
imperialists, the masterminds of the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons, are making an issue of the peaceful use of our nuclear 
energy while shamelessly talking about the need to abide by the 
NPT by finding fault with our nonexistent, so-called nuclear 
issue. 
  We cannot but say this is a brazen-faced thievish logic like 
a thief crying: Stop thief! 
  Starting with antisocialist, anti-Republic maneuverings, the 
United States, the ringleader of nuclear proliferation, is 
trying to give us a title of a nuclear criminal by artificially 
fabricating a falsehood named North Korea's nuclear issue. This 
is really ridiculous. 
  In actuality, what should be regarded seriously at the 
moment 
is the United States, which is preventing a nuclear-free world 
by exporting nuclear-related equipment to potential countries 
with nuclear weapons. 
  As a criminal state that is proliferating nuclear weapons, 
the United States should be judged in the culprit's dock of the 
international community. 
  The U.S. imperialists should not find fault with our 
peace-loving Republic, but apologize to the international 
community for their own criminal act of violating the NPT and 
encouraging nuclear proliferation, and should no longer apply 
the brake on the building of a nuclear-free world.

  [Text] According to military sources, the U.S. 
imperialists conducted a series of aerial mobile deployment 
exercise on 22 and 23 May, lifting troops from U.S. bases in the 
Pacific area to South Korea. 
  Pursuit-assault planes and VTOL [vertical takeoff and 
landing] assault planes that took off from overseas bases flew 
into the U.S. occupation Air Force bases in South Korea on 23 
May. Prior to this, on 22 May, squadrons of assault planes and 
pursuit-assault planes that left a base in Japan flew into the 
U.S. bases in South Korea. 
  This war exercise was aimed at examining overseas-based 
fighter planes' actual combat ability of rapid mobile deployment 
to South Korea. 
  In the meantime, C-141 and C-130 transport planes carrying 
many troops of the aggression army and war equipment took off 
from U.S. Pacific bases and flew into the U.S. occupation Air 
Force bases in South Korea on 22 May, and the troops and 
murderous equipment carried by air were deployed in areas of 
operations. 
  The U.S. imperialists' planned war exercise commotion is a 
grave challenge to peace and detente of Korea.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii expressed hope Wednesday [1 June] that Japan and the 
United States would reach a trade agreement before the July 
summit of leading industrial nations. 
  He said his ministry, which is in charge of the insurance 
sector in the talks under a bilateral trade "framework," will 
make "utmost efforts" to reach an accord by the July 8 start of 
the Group of Seven (G-7) summit in Naples, Italy. 
  The insurance talks started earlier in the day, three and a 
half months after breaking down on February 11 over how to 
measure progress in opening Japan's markets. 
  Fujii told a regular news conference he knew nothing of the 
details of the day's Tokyo talks, as he had been in Diet 
hearings all day. 
  On the economy, despite a surge in the stock market and 
upturns in several economic indicators, Fujii said he cannot yet 
judge that the economy has hit bottom as "not necessarily good" 
factors continue to cloud the emerging bright signs.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
apparently broke no new ground Wednesday [1 June] in a cautious 
return to the trade negotiating table for the first time in 
three and a half months. 
  The day's talks on insurance trade, the most promising of 
three priority areas, consisted of confirming progress made 
before bilateral trade "framework" talks broke down in February, 
a Japanese official said. 
  Both sides expressed caution, but there were indications the 
U.S. was ready to ease its hard-line stance in the insurance 
talks that conclude Thursday in Tokyo. 
  "I gather there's an atmosphere of optimism that we are 
going 
to move forward," a U.S. official said. "The U.S. is going to 
be more flexible but we're not going to throw everything 
overboard." 
  But the official, who asked not to be named, said the 
Americans were sticking to their main positions, adding, "we'll 
just have to see how things go in this first round -- whether we 
move forward or just get stuck." 
  The Japanese side was also cautious, with one Finance 
Ministry official saying both sides remain apart on the pace of 
liberalizing the foreign-dominated "third sector" of insurance 
that includes accident, nursing care and disease coverage. 
  Washington is urging Tokyo to go slow on deregulating the 
sector, with U.S. officials stressing in the past the need for 
"prudent" regulation. But Japan sees the go-slow demand as an 
attempt by the U.S. to hold its lead. 
  Nonetheless, insurance was an area that both sides have said 
was nearer to agreement than other priority areas -- government 
procurement and automobiles and car parts -- as it is less 
likely to revert to bickering over whether U.S. demands amount 
to "numerical targets." 
  The framework talks broke down on February 11, when then 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton 
could not agree on the "objective criteria" called for in the 
framework accord signed last July. 
  In restarting the talks, the U.S. side said that although it 
wants a "results-oriented" agreement, it is not seeking 
market-share "targets." But Tokyo's concerns remain. 
  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said Wednesday that the 
"Japan-U.S. gap has shrunk considerably" but that no sectoral 
agreements have been reached. 
  Answering questions in the House of Representatives budget 
committee, Kakizawa expressed a "fear that something like a 
request for numerical targets could emerge." 
  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, whose ministry is 
responsible for the insurance talks, vowed his "utmost efforts" 
to reach a framework agreement in time for a July summit of 
major industrial nations. But he told a regular news conference 
he did not know the details of the day's insurance talks. 
  Asked if both sides could wrap up an agreement on insurance 
in two days, lead U.S. negotiator Ira Wolf, assistant trade 
representative for Japan and China, smiled and said, "We'll see." 
  The Japanese team is headed by Eisuke Sakakibara, deputy 
chief of the Finance Ministry's International Finance Bureau. 
  The two countries are to resume the auto and parts talks 
Thursday in Washington and the talks on Japanese Government 
procurement of medical equipment and telecommunications Friday 
in Tokyo.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- U.S. trade negotiators were 
expected to offer a compromise plan in insurance sector talks 
Thursday [2 Jun] with a model for a unified licensing system, 
Japanese officials said. 
  In the second day of insurance talks under a restarted 
bilateral trade "framework," the American side was expected to 
respond to Japanese complaints that state-by-state licensing 
arrangements hinder the entry of foreign firms to the U.S. 
market, the officials said. 
  U.S. officials could not immediately be reached for comment. 
  Japanese officials have said their demand for more 
uniformity 
in the U.S. insurance market was their only request in the 
insurance talks. 
  A unified U.S. licensing model would thus open the way for 
compromises by both sides. Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii 
vowed "utmost efforts" Wednesday to reach agreement in the talks 
in time for a July summit of major industrial nations. 
  In the agreement that got the talks back on track after 
three 
and a half months, both sides said they would seek to improve 
access to both markets. 
  Before the breakdown of the framework talks in February, 
U.S. 
negotiators avoided specific discussions of U.S. market access 
problems, saying they were willing to "consult" on U.S. market 
conditions but not negotiate on them. 
  Indeed, the Japanese officials described the expected U.S. 
unified licensing model as being for reference. 
  Each U.S. state supervises its own insurance industry, 
unlike 
Japan's nationwide standards. Tokyo has called this a barrier 
to foreign entry, citing cases in which Japanese nonlife 
insurers required nearly 30 years to receive licenses in all 50 
states. 
  The U.S. wants Japan to go slow in deregulating the 
foreign-dominated "third sector" of its insurance market -- 
including nursing care and disease coverage. 
  The insurance talks, the first in the framework's three 
priority areas, began Wednesday in Tokyo. 
  Talks on automobiles and auto parts are to begin Thursday in 
Washington, and talks on Japanese Government procurement of 
medical and telecommunications equipment are to begin Friday in 
Tokyo.

  [Text] An official of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] said that approximately 5,000 of the 8,000 nuclear 
fuel rods at a five-megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon have 
already been replaced. 
  The official said: In the past 25 days, North Korea has 
already changed approximately 5,000 -- over 60 percent -- of the 
8,000 nuclear feul rods at the nuclear reactor. It continued 
changing the feul rods even yesterday, when the IAEA called upon 
North Korea not to do so. 
  He added: In the initial stages of replacing the fuel rods, 
at least 300 fuel rods must be analyzed to verify the amount of 
nuclear materials that may have been transformed. However, with 
less than 3,000 nuclear fuel rods remaining, the results are 
unreliable. 
  Also, IAEA Spokesman Hans Meyer said that because IAEA 
inspectors could not confirm the location of approximately 40 
fuel rods -- which North Korea says it has separately preserved 
-- and because the location of the removed fuel rods has not 
been disclosed, taking samples from them would not be worthwhile.

  [Text] China's XINHUA reported on 1 June that regarding 
North Korea's replacing fuel rods at its nuclear reactor, China 
had expressed its official position that the further measurement 
of the removed fuel rods must be carried out as soon as possible. 
  XINHUA, in a dispatch from New York, reported that the UN 
Security Council had adopted its presidential statement toward 
North Korea, and that Li Zhaoxing, PRC Ambassador to the United 
Nations, stressed that "China would oppose any action that will 
aggravate the situation, and create tension on the Korean 
peninsula," thus urging both North Korea and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency to resume negotiations at the earliest 
date. It also reported that he had openly delivered a message 
of strong warning to the North Korean side.

<F P=106> [By Reporter Choe Kyu-sik] </F>
  [Text] It was learned on 25 May, that our government will 
conduct an overall reexamination of its policy toward the North 
in connection with North Korea's nuclear development, thereby 
readjusting our position toward "the declaration on the 
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula." 
  The government has worked out such a policy under 
circumstances in which the prevailing opinion is that "the 
declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" has 
virtually become scrap paper because North Korea possesses a 
nuclear reprocessing facility referred to as a radiochemical 
laboratory, in Yongbyon, and in preparation against the 
eventuality that might be created if North Korea is revealed to 
have already developed two or three nuclear bombs following the 
measurement of fuel rods at the 5-megawatt atomic reactor. 
  In this connection, at the Foreign Affairs-National 
Unification Committee of the National Assembly on 23 May, Yi 
Hong-ku, deputy prime minister for national unification, said: 
"If North Korea should continue to maintain the radiochemical 
laboratory, which is known to be a nuclear reprocessing 
facility, we cannot but reevaluate the declaration of the 
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula from a new angle." 
  The government is going to focus on the question raised by 
Deputy Prime Minister Yi at the Unification-National Security 
Policy Coordination meeting to be held on 27 May before making 
public a new government position. 
  Prior to this meeting, the government is said to also be 
undertaking a working-level policy finetuning procedure by 
convening a strategic planning team meeting for unification and 
national security composed of chiefs of relevant agencies' 
offices and bureaus on 26 May. 
  One high-ranking government official said: "Deputy Prime 
Minister Yi's remarks are based on a basic principle, but his 
remarks are loaded with meaning. The government is of the 
opinion that it should lay a clearer and more detailed policy 
before the public this time. Now is not, however, the time to 
declare the nullification of the declaration on the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. His remarks emphasize 
ensuring the nuclear transparency of North Korea. The 
government also needs to send out a strong warning message to 
North Korea for its on-going nuclear development. The United 
States has the position that the special inspections of North 
Korea's nuclear development should be settled at the third round 
of North-U.S. high-level talks. We cannot rule out the 
possibility that even if North Korea is revealed to already 
possess two or three nuclear bombs, the United States will not 
be able to do anything because of its adherence to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty system. We need to readjust our 
position in preparation against this situation."

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 2 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The Cable 
News Network (CNN) will be asked to clarify its news report 
claiming Malaysia is among three Muslim countries supplying arms 
to Bosnian Muslims in violation of a United Nations ban. We 
want to know their intention for carrying the report, 
Information Minister Mohamed Rahmat told reporters here 
Wednesday. 
  The CNN reported Tuesday, quoting sources, that Malaysia, 
Iran and Turkey had been identified as the countries running 
arms to the Bosnians. 
  Malaysian Prime Minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed denied it, 
and 
Turkey did the same. Mohamed urged CNN to carry Dr. Mahathir's 
denial if it wished to be fair to Malaysia.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Although it is Turkmenistan President Saparmurad 
Niyazov's first visit to Malaysia, considerable headway was 
achieved in ties with Malaysia. The five bilateral agreements 
signed in various fields are vital as they will pave the way to 
enhance two-way cooperation. This is all the more significant 
as the breakaway Soviet Union state only achieved independence 
three years ago. 
  Therefore, there is much the Central Asian nation can learn 
from Malaysia. As can be seen from the deteriorating situation 
in Russia, the transition towards a market-based economy is not 
all that easy. It is important that the right economic policies 
and development strategies are in place. To this end, Malaysia 
is ready to offer its expertise wherever it is possible in the 
spirit of South-South cooperation. 
  With a population of 4.2 million people, Turkmenistan is 
rich 
in oil and gas reserves, minerals, cotton, and chemical 
properties. This provides excellent prospects for the 
development of downstream activities -- an area where Malaysia 
has excelled in. The national oil corporation Petronas can look 
into tapping the oil and gas reserves besides looking to develop 
petrochemicals in Turkmenistan. Other areas for potential joint 
ventures include hotel construction, resort facilities, and 
tourism. But the former Soviet state has to realize that 
foreign investments do not flow into a country automatically. 
It must work towards creating a conducive investment climate. 
Red tape must be cut to a minimum. Bureaucracy has been a 
major obstacle for cross-border investments. 
  This is often the case in developing countries. So far, 
Turkmenistan's legislation which provides for foreign 
investments is a step in the right direction. Its free economic 
zones is yet another indicator that its investment strategy is 
on the right track. Infrastructure facilities have to be well 
in place, otherwise foreigners will be reluctant to invest. It 
also has to realize that competition for the foreign investment 
dollar is getting more intense. Also, its private sector has 
yet to fully develop its potential. 
  There is much it can learn from Malaysia's success in 
privatization. It is important that the development of private 
enterprises is accompanied by social benefits. Otherwise a wide 
cross section of the people will never taste the fruits of 
economic development and might sow the seeds of discontent. 
Malaysia is ready to offer training aid under the Malaysia 
technical cooperation program in administration, banking, and 
other fields. It has trained officers under this program from 
numerous other developing nations. It forms part of Malaysia's 
commitment towards transferring skills to South countries. 
  Turkmenistan's decision to establish an embassy in Malaysia 
marks a major step in building a concrete bridge towards 
enhancing two-way contacts at the highest level. This would go 
a long way in bringing bilateral links to a more significant 
level. 
  Niyazov's visit, which comprises a high-powered delegation, 
indicates the importance the country places in its relationship 
with Malaysia. The visit has also opened a new chapter in what 
is potentially a mutually beneficial and long-lasting 
relationship between Malaysia and Turkmenistan.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Mon. [30 May] -- The bilateral 
relations between Malaysia and China have reached a new level of 
understanding and cooperation, and the two countries should take 
pride in the steady development, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed 
said. 
  He said in the last five years, bilateral relations had 
increased by leaps and bounds in many fields of cooperation. 
  "I am confident this trend will be further reinforced in the 
years to come," he said in a two-page letter to Chinese Premier 
Li Peng on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of diplomatic 
ties between the two countries. His letter was released by 
Wisma Putra [Foreign Ministry]. 
  Formal ties were sealed in Beijing on May 31, 1974 by the 
late Tun Abdul Razak, then Malaysian Prime Minister, and his 
then Chinese counterpart the late Zhou Enlai. 
  Dr. Mahathir paid tribute to Razak's vision and courage in 
making Malaysia the first ASEAN country to normalise ties with 
China. 
  "I believe credit for the development of the excellent 
relations between Malaysia and China should also go to the 
pragmatic and outward-looking leadership of China," he said. 
  He said the policy of friendly relations with neighbouring 
countries had encouraged positive developments in bilateral 
relationships, particularly in recent years. 
  Both Malaysia and China could take pride in the steady 
development of mutually satisfying relations over the last two 
decades although links between them actually go back a long way 
in history, he added. 
  Apart from the rapid increase in economic cooperation, 
trade, 
and investment, Dr. Mahathir said cooperation in other fields 
such as tourism, cultural exchanges, and people-to-people 
contacts would further encourage better understanding and 
friendship. 
  Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi also sent a 
message on the occasion to his Chinese counterpart and Vice 
Premier Qian Qichen. 
  Li, in a congratulatory message to Dr. Mahathir, said both 
China and Malaysia were developing countries with similar 
historical experiences and were now facing the great tasks of 
developing the national economy. 
  "The seeds of Sino-Malaysian friendship sowed 20 years ago 
have now yielded rich fruits. I am convinced that the tree of 
our friendship that is being fostered will grow even healthier 
in the years to come." 
  Noting Dr. Mahathir's three visits to China in recent years, 
the Chinese premier said the visits had promoted mutual 
understanding and trust and brought Sino-Malaysian relations to 
a new stage of all-round development. The economic and trade 
cooperation between the two countries had now made remarkable 
achievements, he said. 
  "It has been proven by facts that the maintenance of 
friendly 
and good neighbourly relations between China and Malaysia is not 
only in conformity to the fundamental interests of the two 
countries, but also conducive to the peace, stability, and 
prosperity of the region." 
  Qian sent a similar message to Abdullah expressing the hope 
that the existing strong relations between the two countries 
would continue to be consolidated in the future. 
  "We highly regard your government for upholding justice and 
speaking out from a sense of justice in international affairs 
and promoting the political stability and economic prosperity of 
this region," he said.

their trade volume through a bilateral trading system. 
Turkmenistan's other great potential in the economic sector is 
its huge cotton industry, which is well-known for its good

  Indonesia has numerous commodities which could satisfy 
Turkmenistan's needs, for example, its ready-made garment 
products and several other industrial commodities.

<F P=106> [By Jakarta Correspondent Paul Jacob] </F>
  [Text] Jakarta -- Research and Technology Minister B.J. 
Habibie yesterday denied that the cost of 39 former East German 
naval vessels was higher than estimated but admitted that the 
overall cost to support their operations would total at least 
US$1.1 billion [Singapore dollar] (S$1.7 billion). 
  He said that the US$1.1 billion figure included not only the 
cost of the vessels themselves but refurbishment and a range of 
new facilities such as bases that would have to be built to 
support their operations. 
  Dr Habibie, who put the cost of each vessel at between US$10 
million and US$12 million, made the comments in response to an 
article in the latest edition of the TEMPO weekly magazine which 
put the cost of the vessels alone at US$1.1 billion. 
  Indonesia purchased 16 corvettes, 14 landing ship tanks and 
nine minesweepers from Germany last year and has already taken 
delivery of nine vessels. 
  TEMPO reported that Dr Habibie sought US$1.1 billion from 
Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad to purchase the vessels but the 
request was turned down. 
  He then reportedly asked for US$600 million, which was again 
rejected, and then sought US$400 million which Mr Mari'e also 
rejected. 
  The article said that given the US$1.1 billion price tag, it 
would have been better to buy newer multi-purpose vessels which 
would have cost less -- and would not have caused friction 
between Mr Mar'ie and Dr Habibie, the magazine said. 
  In his remarks to reporters before a Cabinet session 
yesterday, Dr Habibie appeared to be furious about the article 
and repeated time and again that the ships alone did not cost 
that much and were also not old vessels. 
  He said, for instance, that the oldest vessel had only been 
in service for seven years before being mothballed when the two 
Germanies united. 
  Dr Habibie underlined again that the cost had not been 
inflated and that there would be no cancellation of the purchase 
plans. 
  When it announced the purchase last year, Indonesia said 
that 
it was doing so as it needed to replace several of its ageing 
vessels and also needed the numbers to patrol and safeguard its 
vast territorial waters.

  The announcement put to rest one of the major political 
questions of the year, and one that had been frequently asked 
since the time Feisal was appointed to the number one post in 
ABRI in May of last year. 
  There had been speculation that Suharto, who as the 
commander 
in chief has the last word on military appointments, was going 
to replace Feisal with General Wismoyo Arismunandar, currently 
Army Chief of Staff and two years his junior. This line of 
reasoning went that Feisal was simply keeping the seat warm for 
Wismoyo. 
  With the extension of his active service, Feisal is now 
widely expected to retain his post, according to political 
observers. 
  In the past, Suharto extended the service of L.B. Murdani 
and 
Try Sutrisno, two former ABRI chiefs, to allow both to retain 
the post. Feisal's immediate predecessor, Edi Sudrajat, only 
held the post for three months before he turned 55, after which 
he was whisked away to become Minister of Defense and Security. 
  By law the President can extend the service of any colonel 
or 
general by one year at a time. 
  Murdiono said that Feisal was given extended service, which 
will take effect on July 1, because the President felt that his 
services are still needed. 
  Feisal, who was born on June 17, 1939, in Tarutung North 
Sumatera, graduated from the National Military Academy in 1962. 
  He rose to prominence when he was assigned by Suharto to 
head 
a military investigation into the bloody incident in East Timor 
in 1991. The investigation subsequently led to the removal of 
two top army generals. 
  Feisal carved his military career in Kopassus [Special 
Forces 
Command], the army's elite red beret force. His stints included 
quashing various separatist insurrections in Maluku and 
Kalimantan.

  [Text] Jakarta, KOMPAS--President Suharto explained that 
there are four issues that must get greater attention now at the 
beginning of PJP II [Second Long-Term Development], namely the 
effective use of civilian government employees, regional 
autonomy of second-level regions, public services, and 
application of modern management. 
  "Only in this way will the wheels of government turn more 
smoothly and development move more quickly," the chief of state 
said Wednesday, 20 April, as he opened the 1994 National 
Coordination Conference (RAKORNAS) on Effectiveness of the State 
Apparatus at the State Palace in Jakarta. 
  Yesterday's program was also attended by Coordinating 
Minister of Public Welfare Azwar Anas, Minister of 
Administrative Reform T.B. Silalahi, Minister of State for the 
Environment Sarwono Kusumaatmadja, Minister of Justice Oetojo 
Oesman, Minister of State for Agrarian Affairs/Chief of the BPN 
[National Agriculture Board] Soni Harsono, and Minister of State 
for Women's Affairs Mien Sugandhi. The RAKORNAS, which is to 
last three days, is being attended by 250 people. They consist 
of secretary generals, secretaries to coordinating ministers, 
secretaries to ministers of state, secretaries of regional 
office affairs, deputies for administration, and chief of 
bureaus for organization, administration, and personnel. 
  In that connection, President Suharto also underlined the 
coordination conference theme, which relates to the 
strengthening of discipline in the apparatus and improvement of 
service to the public. According to the chief of state, public 
services and discipline in the apparatus are two very important 
elements in the administration of government and development. A 
high level of discipline in the apparatus will raise the quality 
of management of governmental administration, and good quality 
of service will expand development opportunities for the people. 
  Therefore, the president said he hoped that this meeting on 
effectiveness of the state apparatus will formulate operational 
actions for improving discipline in the state apparatus and 
improving the quality of service to the public. 
  He also explained that the autonomy of second-level regions 
is an important part of efforts to expand public creativity and 
initiative, which are the key to the success of development 
during this takeoff era. "Therefore, all the issues related to 
the implementation of granting more extensive autonomy to 
second-level regions must receive maximum attention," the 
president said. 
  Since 1974, he said, the government has made preparations 
for 
emphasizing the autonomy of second-level regions. On many 
occasions, the president has also asked that all echelons of the 
apparatus make preparations to create in second-level regions a 
regional autonomy that is tangible, dynamic, harmonious, and 
responsible. 
  "Government regulations on government in the regions have 
also been prepared. In this coordination conference, I ask that 
all issues related to this implementation of autonomy receive 
maximum attention," the president said. 
  As for modern management, the chief of state also pointed 
out 
that when he formed the Sixth Development Cabinet he stressed 
the need for modern management to support the implementation of 
PJP II. Such modern management, the president said, needs to be 
applied at the planning, implementation, and supervision stages. 
"This modern management needs to be detailed, analyzed, taught, 
and applied according to its principles in all government work 
units and offices," the president said. 
<H5>  Civilian Employee Education and Training </H5>
  President Suharto also said that in the implementation of 
development up to now, the government has constantly tried to 
promote the career development of civilian government employees. 
The chief of state said he still sees some aspects of career 
development that need to be improved, however, particularly in 
the areas of employee education and training. 
  The career of a civilian employee begins when the employee 
is 
accepted as a candidate employee. Because candidate employees 
come from a variety of sources, the process of teaching them and 
introducing them to the administration of government and 
development is intensive, he said. 
  "What we have been doing, namely using the apprentice 
method, 
appears not to produce optimal results. Therefore, as a part of 
the selection process, candidate employees in the future must 
also receive mental and disciplinary preparation in their prejob 
training," the president said. 
  The president also added that subjects taught, promotion 
procedures, and the quality of lecturers must also be improved 
so that civilian government employees will be truly ready to 
take up their increasingly heavy and complex duties. 
  The president also instructed that other aspects of career 
development be studied very thoroughly. These include employee 
performance appraisal forms, selections for appointments, and 
transfers. Why? The president said, "Future duties require 
better quality government employees who possess professional 
capabilities, are full of enthusiasm to serve, and have high 
levels of discipline."

  [Text] Although taxes have become the largest source of 
revenue for state coffers, the tax burden should continue to be 
scrutinized to make sure that it does not discourage interest in 
investment. That is why the government is always trying to keep 
Indonesian taxes at a level which is attractive to foreign and 
domestic investors. 
  These were the statements made by Minister of Finance Mar'ie 
Muhammad at the dedication of the Tax Service Office in Batam on 
Saturday (23 April). "We need investments because investments 
can create the 11 million jobs which we have targeted up to the 
end of PELITA [Five-Year Development Plan] VI," he asserted. 
  He reminded the audience that there are two dependable 
sources of funding for the continuation of national development, 
i.e., raising tax revenues and seeking increased private 
investment. Both of these play an increasingly important role 
given the fact that the price of oil has continued to fall and 
that the market is saturated. 
  The deregulation package recently launched by the government 
has caused a continued drop in state revenues from excises and 
import duties. "Some import goods have been given relief and 
even freedom from import duties in order to support 
export-oriented industries," he added. 
  For that reason, tax revenues have assumed an increasingly 
important role strategically. Safeguarding tax revenues is no 
longer just the business of the Directorate General of Tax or 
the Department of Finance, but has become a problem for the 
whole nation and state in order to continue our national 
development. 
  "We are not going to play games with taxes. We are past the 
time when we can play games or engage in shady deals with the 
tax officials, and stealing tax revenues, such as occurred in 
Surabaya and Tangerang, will no longer be tolerated," he 
asserted. 
  He acknowledged that almost every province is aware of the 
need to pay taxes. Tax obligation is required in order to comply 
with tax regulations and laws. On the other hand, tax officials 
should not overdo it but should provide service which is proper 
and humane in accordance with existing provisions of the law. 
  Tax Relief 
  On this occasion, the Governor of Riau Soeripto requested 
tax 
relief for local businesses in the Batam region so that they 
could play a role in the Batam Federated Region. "If foreign 
companies can be free from taxes, why can't they [local 
companies] be given tax relief?" he asked, when he was confirmed 
[as published] by reporters. 
  The governor said that businesses in the Batam region, such 
as those on Bintan Island and Balai Karimun Cape, could actually 
supply quartz sand or food to take part in building up Batam. 
However, up to now the economic costs have been considered too 
high because there have been too many fees involved. "Up to now 
they have tended to ship their products to Singapore, even 
though Batam also needs them," he asserted. 
  Governor Soeripto acknowledged that he had discussed the 
request for tax relief with the central government, but that no 
decision had been reached yet. The governor was unwilling to 
give a detailed explanation about the types of fees which local 
companies in the federated region have to pay. 
  In his report, the Governor of Riau stated that Riau's 
economic growth averaged 9.25 percent a year and had taken in 
11.13 trillion rupiahs in investments during PELITA V. This was 
due to industry, mining, agriculture, services and other 
enterprises in Riau. 
  Tax revenues in Riau reached 369.6 billion rupiahs, an 
increase of 262 percent over the previous year. Tax revenues in 
Batam reached 84.7 billion rupiahs, and are expected to reach 
more than 100 billion rupiahs at the beginning of REPELITA VI, 
in line with economic growth in that federated region.

  [Text] Jakarta, KOMPAS--ABRI [Indonesian Armed Forces] 
continues to hold firmly to its principle that it will not 
interfere with the internal affairs of any sociopolitical 
organization. Therefore, the report is not true that ABRI 
supports persons were nominated for the chairmanship of certain 
sociopolitical organizations, including the Development Unity 
Party [PPP]. 
  Lieutenant General R. Hartono, chief of the ABRI 
Sociopolitical Staff, said this to reporters Friday, 22 April, 
in Jakarta. He further stressed that in the PPP congress to be 
held in the middle of this year, ABRI will not give any special 
support to specific candidates promoted for the general 
chairmanship. "ABRI will merely encourage that the congress be 
conducted on the basis of norms that apply to the nation and the 
organization concerned," he said. 
  When asked about reports that B.J. Habibie (minister of 
research and technology) supports KH [Islamic Scholar and 
Pilgrim] Yusuf Hasyim for the August congress of the PPP. 
Hartono quickly replied, "I have never heard that." 
  He acknowledged the possibility that NU (Nahdatul Ulama 
[Muslim Scholars League]) members may personally channel their 
aspirations through the PPP in the next election. Thus, it is 
understandable if there are now calls for candidacies of NU 
people for the PPP chairmanship in the next term. What is clear, 
he said, is that ABRI will not choose sides. 
  When asked his opinion on the leadership of PPP General 
Chairman Ismail Hasan Metareum, the three-star general 
commented, "All right." 
<H5>  Continues To Have No Part in Politics </H5>
  On a separate occasion on Thursday, 21 April, Abdurrahman 
Wahid, general chairman of the NU PB [Executive Council] 
declared that the NU's position continues unchanged, namely that 
it will not take part in politics and will not be bound to any 
sociopolitical organization. If the recent reports that "NU 
people" are prepared to seek PPP leadership are true, they refer 
to personal positions and rights, which have no connection with 
the NU as an organization. 
  Commenting on the meeting of about 50 NU politicians who 
gathered at TMII [Beautiful Indonesia Minipark] last week and 
agreed on leadership of the PPP, Gus Dur [nickname of 
Abdurrahman Wahid] said, "The meeting needs no response from the 
NU. Let it be. They were acting personally, were they not? There 
are NU people in personal capacities in all three sociopolitical 
organizations," he said. 
  Gus Dur strongly objected when he was asked about the 
impression among some people that a number of NU politicians are 
"returning" to the PPP because of not having received any place 
in GOLKAR [Functional Group] or the PDI [Indonesian Democratic 
Party]. "Who said they (i.e., those who held the meeting at 
TMII) are the NU? They were all PPP, not NU. Any NU manager (KH 
Yusuf Hasyim) present, was there in his personal capacity. Those 
who want to plunge into sociopolitical organizations in an 
organizational way are prohibited from using the name of the 
NU," he declared. 
  When asked whether he personally supports an NU member for 
PPP leadership, Gus Dur replied, "There is no need to give 
support. If they want to perform, they should do so--not only in 
the PPP, but in GOLKAR and the PDI, too." 
  On a different occasion, Ali Masykur Musa, general chairman 
of the PB of the Indonesian Islamic Student Movement (PMII), 
said there would be nothing wrong and it would not violate the 
1926 Policy if the NU were to return to politics. "Is not one of 
the points of the policy the promotion of political maturity in 
the Islamic community?" Ali asked. The public demand that the NU 
return to politics, he continued, is an expression of public 
political maturity and is "synchronous" with the NU.

  [Text] Jakarta, KOMPAS--The government will reconsider the 
prices of the PLTGU's [gas-steam electric power plants] at Muara 
Tawar in West Java, Tambak Lorok in Central Java, and Pasuruan 
in East Java. This will be done through a "repeat order." The 
prices bid for Muara Tawar by ABB [expansion unknown] in 
partnership with Marubeni of Japan, for Tambak Lorok by Sumitomo 
of Japan and General Electric of the United States, and for 
Pasuruan by Mitsubishi of Japan and Siemens, which will have a 
total of 2,342 MW [megawatts], were considered by the government 
to be quite high and thus require reconsideration. 
  Minister of Mining and Energy I.B. Sudjana said this 
Saturday, 23 April, at the Department of Mining and Energy after 
inaugurating the Board of Commissioners of Aneka Tambang and the 
Boards of Commissioners and Directors of PT [Limited Company] 
Tambang Timah. 
  "The bids offered by the three contractors were quite high. 
For that reason, the government needs to reconsider them," 
Sudjana said. 
  For the readers information, the high prices were actually 
reduced by the contractors at the end of February after 
receiving instructions from President Suharto. The bid price of 
the three PLTGU's, which have a total capacity of 2,342 MW, was 
reduced from $2.147 billion to $1.769 billion. This approaches 
the PLN price for the Tanjungpriok PLTGU. The total price 
reduction by the three consortia was $378.15 million, or about 
801.678 billion rupiah. 
  Sudjana said that although there is to be a reconsideration, 
as of now he cannot set an ideal price for the three PLTGU's. At 
present, the final price for the construction of the 
Tanjungpriok PLTGU is still being used as a reference for 
setting a price for the projects. The government must decide an 
ideal price for the three PLTGU's after calculating operational 
and technical aspects and the prices of components involved in 
each project. 
<H5>  Coordinating Minister of Economics, Finance, and Development </H5>
Supervision 
  In view of these considerations, the press asked if a new 
contractor is possible, in addition to the three contractors 
decided by the government through the "repeat order." "I do not 
know and cannot yet say," Sudjana replied. 
  The minister of mining and energy said that the decision on 
who is qualified to get the work is up to Saleh Afiff, 
coordinating minister of economics, finance, and development 
supervision. The project is funded by foreign loans connected 
with the Foreign Commercial Loan Team (PKLN), which is under the 
coordination of the coordinating minister of economics, finance, 
and development supervision. 
  "Everything is up to him. If the coordinating minister deems 
another new contractor is needed as compensation for the length 
of time in bringing the project to realization, that is up to 
him. He has the authority to do that," Sudjana said. 
  When mention was made of losses incurred by the PLN because 
of the repeated postponement of a government decision on the 
winning tender, Sudjana admitted that the PLN has suffered 
losses. The losses have not been very big, however, and have 
been limited to loss of time rather than material losses. 
  "There have not been great losses of time, however. I am 
sure 
that if we look at the program for the three projects, all that 
remains to be done is to proceed with them. The sites are ready 
and do not need to be prepared. If everything is ready, that 
will save time in catching up. All that will be needed is 
assembly, and that will not take long compared with the initial 
process, from site preparation to project construction," Sudjana 
asserted. 
  Some time ago, Uno Bintang Sudibyo, chairman of the Electric 
Power Studies Program of the University of Indonesia, said that 
comprehensive comparison studies should be conducted before 
setting a price for the three projects. Whether a project is 
cheap or expensive cannot be determined merely by comparing the 
total price of the project with other projects built previously 
but must take into consideration the details of components that 
make up each project. 
  He said that setting a project price based on each kilowatt 
of electricity from a PLTGU that is to be built must be done 
through a comprehensive comparison study. Primarily, comparison 
must be made with similar projects in other places or other 
countries, possibly in Thailand, for example. 
  As an example, he said the international standard price for 
the capital cost of a PLTGU project of three times 600 MW is 
$700 per kilowatt. "Thus, the PLN may set a price of $800 per 
kilowatt, as long as it conducts very detailed research and make 
comparisons with other countries with lower prices before 
setting a price," he asserted.

  [Text] The fate of about 1,100 workers in two factories in 
Bekasi is now up in the air since their wages have not been paid 
for the last two or three months. Workers in the Orchid 
Beatifull [as published] Garment, Inc in Tambun and in Matra 
Prianangarindu [as published] Garment, Inc in Pondokungu, have 
been given "leave," uncertain as to whether they have been laid 
off or not. 
  Statements gathered by KOMPAS yesterday indicate that the 
workers complained in turn to the Bekasi office of the 
Department of Manpower and to the All-Indonesia Workers' Union 
(SPSI) within the last week. But no solution to their problem 
has been found yet. The two companies have refused to discuss 
the issues. 
  "Besides that, when I asked whether they had the money, the 
companies answered that they didn't have it yet. Come on! As the 
arbitrator, I wouldn't find it hard to solve the problem. If 
they have the money, the company should pay the salaries!," said 
A. Aziz, an official of the Bekasi office of the Department of 
Manpower, who is the arbitrator in the Orchid Beatifull Garment, 
Inc case. 
  There are 600 workers in the Orchid Beatufill [as published] 
Garment, Inc factory. They had been getting paid 3,800 rupiahs 
per day, without any additional money for food, transportation 
or health insurance. Since they have not been paid for the last 
two months, the workers admitted that many of them had resigned 
and were looking for jobs in other companies. 
  "Usually, we are paid on the 5th and 20th days of the month, 
but we haven't been paid for two months. We're actually used to 
the salary being late by one week," Sulistiwa, Chairman of the 
Work Unit Directorate (PUK) of Orchid Beatifull Garment, Inc's 
SPSI, told reporters. 
  Below the UMR [Regional Minimum Wage] 
  Meanwhile, 500 workers at the Matra Prananggurindu Garment, 
Inc factory said they were paid about 2,300 to 2,600 rupiahs per 
day. This means that the company gives them a wage below the 
regional minimum wage for 1994 which the government set at 3,800 
rupiahs per day. 
  "We've already told the personnel department about the 
problem of wages which are often late and have not been paid at 
all for the last two months. Uh, I was not allowed to come back 
to the company. In fact, I can't work unless I know whether I've 
been laid off or not," said Noni, a female worker who was 
chairman of the PUK of Matra Prananggurindu Garment, Inc's SPSI. 
  She was the leader of about 20 female workers who complained 
to the Department of Manpower at SPSI's Bekasi office; Noni and 
her companions carried posters which stated that the company's 
managers were cowards. They don't want to be responsible for the 
fate of 500 workers.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Disposing of Waste"] </F>
  [Text] Although it may not have been one of the more 
sensational events of the week, the inauguration on Monday of 
this country's first industrial waste treatment plant surely 
deserves some comment. 
  The truth is that for far too long too many companies in 
Indonesia have been reluctant to seriously consider the problem 
of waste treatment. 
  To address this problem, on the eve of the new plant's 
inauguration, the government issued a regulation requiring all 
manufacturing companies to neutralize their toxic and hazardous 
wastes. In the past, many industries were reported to have 
raised objections to precisely such a requirement on the basis 
of the argument that the process would add too heavily to their 
production costs and make their products less competitive. 
  Of course for companies operating on a small scale, such an 
argument may be true to a certain extent. After all, 
manufacturing firms have to cope with what economists refer to 
as the economy of scale. That is, the bigger the factory and 
its operations, the lighter the cost burden which the 
manufacturer has to bear relative to the volume of goods 
produced. Such an argument, therefore, seems valid, especially 
since small-scale industries comprise an important segment of 
this country's industrial sector. They not only provide a 
service to the society by turning out goods, but also by 
providing jobs to many thousands of people. 
  The significance of the Nambo Village waste treatment plant 
in this particular context is obviously that it helps bring down 
those additional production costs for small-scale enterprises by 
eliminating the need for them to own and operate their own waste 
treatment plants. 
  In the past, even larger industries were reported to have 
used this argument to object to any government regulation that 
would require them to treat their toxic wastes. Surely, 
however, the developments of the last several years have made it 
clear that such a rationale can no longer hold. Under the new 
world order that is now rapidly taking shape, even the trade and 
industrial sectors can no longer act as if they are unaffected 
by the spirit of environmental awareness that is now rapidly 
spreading across the globe. It is in their own interest that 
industrialists respect the principles of environmental soundness 
if they want to compete in the world market. 
  Thus, as President Suharto remarked on the occasion, the 
inauguration of the new US$95 million plant is expected to make 
Indonesia's industrial products more competitive on 
international markets by meeting the criteria of environmental 
"cleanliness" that more and more countries around the world are 
setting for their imports. The new plant, located at Nambo 
Village in Bogor regency, is the first in Indonesia, as well as 
the biggest of its kind so far in Southeast Asia. A second 
plant for the treatment of industrial wastes is now reportedly 
being planned for construction near Surabaya, East Java's 
provincial capital, which has the second-largest concentration 
of industries in Indonesia. Similar plants are also being 
planned for Lhokseumawe in Aceh and for East Kalimantan. 
  Surely, as this country prepares itself for its take-off 
towards self-sustained growth and because the industrialization 
process is bound to accelerate in the years to come, the 
launching of the Nambo Village waste treatment is a laudable, 
albeit small, step towards ensuring that the process of 
development will not impair the sustained health of our 
environment.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, June 2 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- T. Elbegdorj 
leader of the largest public and political establishment of 
Mongolia -- the Mongolian Democratic Union (MDU) who was one of 
those laying down foundations for democratic transforming of the 
country and being currently in opposition to the incumbent 
authorities has been released today by the session of the Great 
State Hural of Mongolia of his duties of a member of the 
parliament. Out of the 57 members of the parliament being 
present at the sitting some 69.6 percent of them voted for 
complying with the request by T. Elbegdorj on releasing him of 
his duties of legislator which was filed by himself during the 
days of this April hunger strike. His refusal of 
parliamentarianship he motivated by the impossibility to be 
representing the interests of its voters in the parliament. He 
reaffirmed his refusal at the meeting. Meanwhile the majority 
of members of the parliament were of other opinion considering 
T. Elbegdorj has lost both moral and juridical right to be an MP 
bearing in mind the recent hunger strike calling for the 
resignation of the government of members and supporters of the 
MDU and the accuse of being guilty in leaking the state 
classified information which was brought against him by the 
Central Investigation Board. It is likely that it is the latter 
which would be applied as a basis for the parliamentary bill on 
releasing T. Elbegdorj of his duties of an MP.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, June 2 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- It is likely 
that the composition of the government's team would be changed 
by resigning of some of its members judging from some 
publications of the newspaper "ARDIYN ERH" and the newspaper 
"UNEN" issued by the ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary 
Party [MPRP]. If the central official press "ARDIYN ERH" on its 
first pages is demanding in the editorial to undertake serious 
measures in tackling properly the cabinet of ministers up to 
removing from the composition of some its members, the "UNEN" is 
directly naming those ministries and departments which leaders 
have been viewed to quit their ministerial posts. In 
substantiating its criticism the "UNEN" resorts to the arguments 
put forth by the democrats voiced during the days of a political 
hunger strike in April for the resignation of the government. 
The "ARDIYN ERH" is quoting the General Secretary of the ruling 
MPRP B. Dashyondon as saying that it is quite possible to 
provide changes in the team of the government. The "ARDIYN ERH" 
of today calls the name of the Minister of External Relations T. 
Gombosuren devoting him a whole page in today's issue. Holding 
his post T. Gombosuren managed to outlive three premiers namely 
D. Sodnom, S. Gungaadorj and D. Byambasuren. 
  Among the writers of the country the pursuit for the year's 
state prize is carrying on. The prize is awarded annually on 
the eve of the main holiday of the country being the Naadam 
which is celebrated in July. The "ARDIYN ERH" publishes an 
article by Doctor L. Tudev who is standing for conferring all 
the candidates excepting D. Maam, a writer who three years ago 
headed the alternative writers' organization. 
  At the conference held in Cairo of foreign ministers of 
nonaligned movement countries Mongolia released a memorandum on 
the issues under discussion as an official document of the 
conference which is provided in today's issue of the newspaper 
as well. 
  The newspaper informs that Mongolian businessmen still 
continue in order to make their own profit betraying the 
national interests of the country. The fact that two years ago 
the U.S.A granted the most favourable terms nation's status to 
Mongolia has lead to the growing interest arose on the part of 
many Hong Kong's firms to Mongolia. During the last period 
several attempts to bring into the country of finished 
production with forged documents on their manufacturing in 
Mongolia for reselling on the U.S. market have been revealed. 
The newspaper reports about one of such cases where there are 
involved in some firms of China and Hong Kong. 
  The newspaper "UNEN" carries an interview with member of the 
steering council of the MPRP, chairman of the Standing Committee 
of the parliament N. Bayarsaihan. The main topic of the 
interview is the progress in reference to the economic 
reformings, its outcome and prospects for near future. N. 
Bayarsaihan acknowledges that the aim of the government being to 
check the decline in production, and attain stabilizing of the 
situation for a two-year-long period has not been fulfilled. He 
is in favour of intensifying the privatization of state-owned 
property. So far the most of national wealth is still nobody's. 
Moreover there have been formed some groupings interested in 
retaining such a case in order to dispose as they think fit of 
this no man's property, said N. Bayarsaihan. To corroborate 
this statement, he quotes the names of joint stock companies 
with prevailing state-owned property pattern.

<F P=106> [Article by Amando Doronila: "A Foreign Policy Disaster"] </F>
  [Text] The order issued by a Quezon City court restraining 
the organizers of the Asia-Pacific Conference on East Timor from 
holding the conference resolves the Philippine-Indonesia 
impasse, ostensibly within the context of the Philippine 
constitutional system. The cancellation of the meeting defuses 
the diplomatic crisis to the satisfaction of Indonesia, which 
had in the first place sought to abort it as early as last 
November. It is a triumph of Indonesian blitz diplomacy. 
  But the resolution of the conflict does not erase the fact 
that the crisis has left Philippine diplomacy in a shambles. 
The Philippines' handling of the crisis was an absolute 
disaster. The crisis inflicted on the Philippines its worst 
humiliation and degradation at the hands of another country 
since the Japanese occupation, and ironically the humiliation 
was administered by the Philippines' supposedly closest ally in 
ASEAN. Having observed closely the golden age of Philippine 
diplomacy during the 1950s to the 1970s, I have never seen a 
more inept handling of Philippine foreign relations than by the 
Ramos administration, and the diplomatic disaster should make us 
weep over the ignominy of the Republic. 
  This essay seeks to establish responsibility for this 
disaster. From evidence, much of the blame rests on the 
usurpation of crisis management by the National Security Council 
(NSC) -- a function of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which 
has an experienced bureaucracy. When Indonesia applied the heat 
on us, President Ramos heeded the counsel of the NSC, headed by 
Gen. Jose Almonte, more than it listened to the Department of 
Foreign Affairs (DFA), which had its own recommendations to the 
president. Malacanang [Palace; presidential office] called, 
the shots on the responses to Indonesian pressure and the DFA 
merely echoed Palace directives. 
  The NSC-inspired responses were characterized by panic, 
retreat and appeasement. The dispatch of a diplomatic mission 
to Jakarta headed by former Secretary of Foreign Affairs Raul 
Manglapus and Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino to explain the 
Philippine position that the conference cannot be canceled 
without breaching our constitutional principles of freedom of 
assembly and of speech failed to impress and appease 
authoritarian Indonesia. The mission left the impression that 
the Philippines acted like a tributary state to Indonesia Raya 
(Greater Indonesia), and the Indonesians, of course, arrogantly 
displayed their scorn for us. President Suharto refused to 
receive the delegation. According to Manglapus, Suharto was in 
Bogor, entertaining New Zealand Prime Minister James Bolger, who 
was on a state visit. Whatever the explanation, the fact is 
that Suharto disdainfully snubbed the mission. 
  The government had absolutely no response, except 
appeasement, to the three-pronged pressure by Indonesia -- the 
threat of canceling the peace talks with Muslim separatist 
rebels hosted by Indonesia, the Indonesian boycott of the East 
Asian Business Conference in Davao on the East Asian economic 
triangle, and the detention and harassment of Filipino fishermen 
fishing in or near Indonesian waters. The NSC failed to 
consider that the threat of Indonesia's withdrawal of support 
for the peace talks with the separatist Muslims is partly bluff, 
as I shall discuss later. The economic triangle concept is at 
an embryonic stage, waiting for its time to come and has an 
economic dynamic of its own. The harassment of Filipino 
fishermen can be countered by diplomatic protests. 
  The response of appeasement was premised on the assumption 
that relations with Indonesia must be saved at all costs because 
of the mistaken belief that Indonesia has been the most 
supportive Philippine ally in ASEAN, and therefore we owe a lot 
to it. This assumption flies in the face of evidence that 
Indonesia is as much in debt to us as we are to it because of 
the fact that our hosting of the U.S. military bases served as a 
security shield which permitted Indonesia and a host of other 
countries in East Asia to divert their resources to development 
away from costly defense expenditures. 
  The failure to respond to the escalated Indonesian pressure 
and even to summon anger over Indonesia's bulldozing tactics 
revealed the NSC to be bankrupt in experience, imagination, and 
sophistication in responding to foreign relations crisis. The 
NSC has a de facto "think tank" composed of academics, 
consultants and arm-chair experts on geo-politics. Its head, 
Gen. Almonte, claims to have a strategic view of things and 
appears to have vast pretensions on geo-politics on regional and 
international scale, but these pretensions are not matched by 
NSC's performance during the crisis. Retreat and appeasement 
are the best proof of this bankruptcy. 
  When the NSC's view of things collided with realpolitik, 
the views based on fanciful models, crumbled. I suspect that 
the NSC would like to believe that it is a center of strategic 
decision making, superior to the Department of Foreign Affairs, 
following the model of the U.S. National Security Council under 
Dr. Henry Kissinger. Under President Nixon, he depended on 
Kissinger for strategic decision more than he did on the State 
Department, but the State Department's resources were 
nonetheless deployed in policy and decision making, and besides, 
Dr. Kissinger is one of the most brilliant practitioners of 
realpolitik and had assembled a brilliant staff at the NSC. 
Almonte is no Kissinger. 
  The undermining of the DFA began when President Ramos signed 
as one of his first executive orders a directive broadening the 
powers of the NSC to intervene in all aspects of national life. 
The directive said that with the end of the Cold War and with 
the shift in the character of conflict from armed confrontation 
to economic competition, the compass of national security should 
embrace also economic and foreign affairs. 
  The usurpation of the functions of the DFA by the NSC was 
facilitated by the fact that the DFA has been depleted of senior 
leadership -- a vacuum which the NSC tried to fill. During the 
1950s up until the 1970s, the DFA had been gifted with strong 
foreign ministers and a deep bench of experienced diplomats. It 
was led by a constellation of brilliant diplomats such as Carlos 
P. Romulo, S.P. Lopez, Jose Inglis, Narciso Reyes, Narciso 
Ramos, et al, and second line back up from people like Raul 
Manglapus and Leon Ma. Guerrero. These diplomats were 
authoritative and presidents listened to them and respected 
them. Moreover, foreign relations received a boost from 
presidents like Elpidio Quirino and Diosdado Macapagal, who had 
an international outlook. Foreign relations was their strong 
suit. 
  By contrast, President Ramos is a man with a provincial and 
parochial outlook. He is a plodding leader who has no fire in 
his belly. He remains cool even under humiliation of the 
national honor. His appreciation of foreign relations is 
supplied mainly, by the NSC, whose depth, experience and 
sophistication have been found to be nil by the crisis. 
Moreover, there have been attempts to undermine the leadership 
of the DFA under Secretary Roberto Romulo. Last summer there 
were moves, which didn't go unnoticed by the CIA, to inquire 
into the medical records of Romulo in the United States, in an 
apparent attempt to embarrass him and to oust him from the DFA. 
  The threat by Indonesia to withdraw support of the peace 
talks with Muslim separatists is partly bluff. It later on 
decided to allow the talks to be held in Jakarta, and this is 
not an act of charity. The settlement of the Muslim rebellion 
leading to the ending of separatism serves the interests of 
Indonesia as it does the Philippines. Separatism in the 
Philippines inspires separatism by the outer islands of 
Indonesia. If the separatist movement in Mindanao succeeded in 
dismembering the Philippines, latent separatist rebellions in 
Indonesia could flare up to detach themselves from the 
Java-centered rule in Indonesia. But in panic, the NSC forgot 
all about this. Because of its panic, it is extremely important 
to reassess the role of the shell-shocked NSC in foreign 
relations whose credibility crumbled during the crisis.

<F P=106> [By Rufina B. Alcanzo] </F>
  [Text] The country's outstanding foreign debt as of 
December last year reached $34.282 billion, up 10.82 percent 
from the $30.934 billion recorded during the corresponding 
period in 1992. 
  On a monthly basis, this represented a slight 1.47 percent 
increment from $33.787 billion in November last year. 
  Official records from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) 
[Central Bank of the Philippines] show 85.31 percent of total 
foreign debt were classified as medium-and long-term 
obligations, which rose 14 percent from $25.678 billion in the 
same period in 1992. 
  On the other hand, short-term loans comprised the remaining 
14.69 percent, which amounted to $5.035 billion. 
  By types of borrower, the public sector received the biggest 
chunk of foreign loans. This was placed at $27.177 billion, 
taking in a 79.28 percent share of aggregate loans. 
  The private sector was granted $5.817 billion, allotted 
between corporate and financial firms. Corporate firms received 
a bigger share of $5.296 billion while financial firms cornered 
the rest. 
  Meanwhile, the BSP got a measly 3.76 percent or $1.288 
billion of total borrowings. 
<H5>  BILATERAL CREDITORS </H5>
  Bilateral creditors extended the biggest amount, which stood 
at $13.369 billion or 39 percent of total loans. This 
represented an 18 percent hike from the $11.328 billion lendings 
in the comparable period in 1992. All loans granted by 
bilateral creditors have beyond one year maturity. 
  Among bilateral creditors, the country remains to be heavily 
indebted to Japan which granted medium-and long-term loans 
amounting to $7.577 billion. The United States came in next 
providing $684 million while Germany lent out $489 million as of 
the period in review. 
  Roughly 23 percent of aggregate foreign exchange liabilities 
were extended by multilateral creditors. As in the preceding 
months, the World Bank's International Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development furnished the largest amount at $3.936 billion. 
It was followed by the Asian Development Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund, which shelled out $2.3 billion and 
$1.312 billion, respectively. 
<H5>  WORLD BANK </H5>
  In a related development, the World Bank has lined up 12 
more 
projects for the next three years. These projects offer an 
aggregate financing cost of $2.585 billion which is $853 million 
more than the "shopping list" presented by the Philippine 
Government. 
  These include agriculture support services, power 
transmission, and AIDS emergency projects which are all set for 
next year. For 1996, the following will be eyed: Central 
Visayas regional project; and power distribution, capital market 
development and urban water supply projects. 
  Meanwhile, by the year 1997, rural regional development, 
private investment credit, water distribution, urban sanitation 
and provincial road projects are expected to be put up. 
  It may be recalled a few weeks earlier, Senator Blas Ople 
urged the National Economic and Development Authority to 
undertake a full accounting of foreign loans that flow into 
16,000 nongovernment organizations (NGOs) amid reports that 
human rights groups in Europe have been subsidizing communist 
insurgency in the country. He advocated the use of caution in 
giving direct aid to local NGOs.

<F P=106> [By Rosemarie V. Francisco] </F>
  [Text] The recently signed banking liberalization law 
effectively eliminates the nationalization privilege of rural 
banks as foreign banks are now also allowed to invest in rural 
banks, savings and loan associations and thrift banks. 
  Senator Raul S. Roco, chairman of the committee on banks, 
financial institutions and currencies yesterday, told members of 
the Makati Chamber of Commerce and Industry that the new law 
liberalizes not only the commercial banking industry but also 
the rural banking industry which was previously monopolized by 
Filipinos. 
  One mode of entry for foreign banks under the banking 
liberalization law is the opening or acquisition of subsidiaries 
where they can own up to 60 percent voting stock. Mr. Roco said 
foreign banks can, therefore, acquire rural and thrift banks as 
subsidiaries. 
  However, Mr. Roco told BUSINESS WORLD he has not heard yet 
of 
any foreign bank interested to enter such an investment in small 
rural and thrift banks. 
  In case foreign banks do invest in rural banks, this would 
lead to the closure of or mergers among small rural banks which 
do not have the financial backing of foreign banks. 
  Earlier, Negros Oriental Rep. Margarito Teves told a forum 
at 
the Center for Research and Communication the entry of new 
foreign banks in the country will not affect smaller financial 
entities like rural banks since foreign banks are more likely to 
concentrate on wholesale business. Rural banks specialize in 
the retail business. 
  Mr. Teves also said he expects a linkage between foreign 
banks and rural banks to be established with the new law since 
foreign banks need the expertise of rural banks in countryside 
lending. 
  Some bankers also expect that foreign banks would 
concentrate 
on big-ticket transactions, which are the business of large 
commercial banks. 
  Benjamin Palma Gil, Philippine National Bank (PNB) executive 
vice president, earlier said the entry of foreign banks may 
create competition on the level of bigger banks. Community 
banks will then be left to handle the smaller businesses. 
  Mr. Roco also said the new law also increases the ownership 
cap of Filipinos in local banks from 30 percent to 40 percent. 
While foreign banks are allowed to own up to 60 percent of the 
total voting stock in a domestic bank or subsidiary, Filipino 
groups who are listed in the stock exchange or are existing for 
at least 10 years are also accorded the same privilege. 
  The banking liberalization law also provides for new funding 
sources for educational institutions, hospitals, cooperatives, 
local government units and low-cost housing. Mr. Roco said 
foreign banks which would offer financing for these sectors 
would be given incentives under the law. 
  The law signed by President Ramos last 18 May allows 10 new 
foreign banks to establish branches in the country within five 
years. It also permits an unlimited number of entrants to set 
up subsidiaries or buy into any of the existing 28 local banks. 
Since the Monetary Board holds the right to decide where the 
last three of the allowable six branches of foreign banks would 
be situated, Mr. Roco said the government would still have 
control over the dispersal of development in the country.

  [Text] Philippine Congress has approved an amnesty offer 
for some 24,000 rebels. In a move hailed by President Ramos as 
a step towards ending all armed revolt in the country. The 
legislature approved the amnesty submitted to it by Ramos early 
this year. The amnesty covers the whole spectrum of rebels who 
have plagued the Philippines for years. Many rebel leaders have 
rejected the amnesty saying it will not solve basic problems 
which caused the rebellion in the first place. The Philippine 
Government announced the amnesty in a bid to bring insurgent 
groups to the peace tables.

  [Text] The Alex Boncayao Brigade (ABB), a communist hit 
squad, is planning to bomb the offices of four big firms three 
of which are government-owned, police said yesterday. 
  Director Ricaredo Sarmiento, chief of the Philippine 
National 
Police-National Capital Region Command (Capcom) placed all Metro 
Manila police units on alert for possible attacks by the ABB. 
  Sarmiento identified the four ABB targets as the National 
Power Corporation plant in Sucat, Paranaque; the main office of 
the Manila Electric Co.; the Land Transportation Office in 
Quezon City; and the Manila Waterways and Sewerage System Office 
in Quezon City. 
  The disclosure of the plot came a day after police arrested 
11 ABB supporters during a lightning rally in Makati .

  [Text] The Board of Investments (BoI) approved the other 
day the grant of fiscal incentives to ten projects with 
investments adding up to P63 billion [Philippine pesos]. 
  The biggest project on the BoI's list is the P30.24 billion 
power generation project of Pangasinan Electric Corp. (PEC), a 
subsidiary of Hopewell Holdings Ltd. 
  PEC will construct and operate a coal-fired thermal power 
plant in Sual, Pangasinan with two units capable of generating 
500 megawatts each. 
  The project, which was accorded pioneer status, will be 
implemented under a 25-year Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) 
agreement PEC reached with National Power Corp. The first unit 
is expected to be operational by December 1998 and the second 
unit, by March 1999. 
  PEC has an authorized and subscribed capital stock of 
P100,000, in which P25,000 has been paid-up. 
  The second biggest project approved by the BoI is the P10.8 
billion expansion project of Digitel Telecommunications Phils. 
Inc. 
  Digitel will expand its telecommunications services in 
Pangasinan, Bulacan, Bataan, and Angeles City. This includes 
transmission, switching, and routing of basic and enhanced 
voice, data, and value-added services as well as domestic and 
international toll services. 
  Further, Digitel will install an additional 115,000 lines in 
Pangasinan by 1998; 64,200 lines in Bulacan; 27,900 lines in 
Bataan; and, 11,127 lines in Angeles City. 
  The firm expects to earn P3.6 million by 1999, and will need 
4,000 staff members to operate the project. 
  Digitel is 87 percent owned by Filipinos and 13 percent by 
Cable &amp; Wireless, a British company. It has an authorized 
capital stock of P6 billion and subscribed and paid-up capital 
of P1.6 billion. 
  Digitel is also a telephone franchise holder in the 
provinces 
of Pampanga, Zambales, Tarlac, Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, 
Isabela, Nueva Vizcaya, Batangas, and in the municipalities of 
Baguio City, Taguig, Binan, and Mabalacat. 
  The BoI also approved the P6.72 billion oil refinery project 
of Thai Petro Chemical Industry Co. Ltd., which will establish 
an oil refinery in Surigao del Norte and, by September 1996, 
produce liquefied petroleum gas, premium and regular gasoline, 
kerosene/jet fuel, diesel, and fuel oil at a capacity of 65,000 
barrels a day. 
  Other projects which obtained approval from the BoI are the: 
  -- P4.5 billion expansion project of Hi-Cement Corp.; 
  -- P3.4 billion petrochemical project of Mitsui Co. Ltd.; 
  -- P3.6 billion modernization project of Integrated 
Microelectronics Inc. for its existing plant in Muntinlupa; 
  -- P2.4 billion power generation project of Ganda Holdings 
Berhad; 
  -- P470.64 million spun yarn project of Indo Phil Cotton 
Mills Inc.; 
  -- P400 million corrugated carton project of San Miguel 
Corp.; and, 
  -- P44.2 million automotive wiring harness project of 
Pilipinas Kyohritsu Inc. 
  The BoI's approval makes this week one of the most 
productive 
in history. BoI officials are optimistic they could surpass 
their P115 billion investment target for 1994.

<F P=106> [By Estela B. De La Paz] </F>
  [Text] Shell Phils. [Philippines] Exploration (SPEX), 
operator of the Camago-Malampaya fields in offshore northwest 
Palawan, yesterday successfully completed its short production 
tests or drill stem tests (DST). 
  SPEX's second DST on the gas zone of the well recorded a 
final flow rate of 24.8 million cubic feet of gas per day and 
1,252 barrels per day of condensate. 
  Dre Boon, SPEX vice-president, earlier told BUSINESS WORLD 
Shell needs a flow rate of about 20 million cubic feet of gas 
per day for the well to be considered of commercial value. 
  The bottom portion of the well, which contains the oil, also 
yielded good flow rates. Shell is satisfied with the stabilized 
flow rate recorded in the oil zone at about 5,627 barrels of oil 
per day, more than what was expected, Mr. Boon said. 
  SPEX will drill its second appraisal well, Malampaya-4, by 
mid-June to confirm the extent of the reserves of the Malampaya 
structure. 
  Mr. Boon said the Malampaya 4 well will be halfway between 
the Malampaya 1 and 2 wells in the north and Malampaya 3 in the 
south. 
  The theory behind this drilling strategy is if Malampaya 4 
shows the same characteristics as the other wells and shows 
positive oil and gas flow rates, then it is possible that 
Malampaya is one big structure. As such, the extent of the oil 
and gas reserves can be estimated. 
  However, while these developments confirm the presence of 
substantial oil and gas deposits in the area, harnessing these 
deposits for commercial quantity may not be easy due to the 
costs involved, as these are in very deep waters. 
  Shell is still negotiating with National Power Corp., its 
main market, to commit 3,000 megawatts to run on natural gas by 
1998. 
  However, because of the costs involved not only in 
production 
but also in transporting the gas from the well-head to Luzon 
shores, the power firm and Shell have not inked any gas supply 
contract. 
  One contention against the use of natural gas by 1998 is the 
additional cost of retrofitting the thermal plants. Moreover, 
natural gas-fed plants must also be competitively priced in 
order to compete for a slot in the power development program 
(PDP). The PDP will be using various fuel resources such as 
coal and geothermal to come up with an efficient generation mix 
between 1998 and 2005.

  [Text] Thailand has lobbied the Cairns Group of farm 
exporting nations to include fisheries products among farm items 
subject to free trade at the upcoming meeting of the World Trade 
Organization. 
  The action came after a recent meeting between the 14 
economic ministers of the Cairns Group. Deputy Prime Minister 
Suphachai Phanitchaphak was the leader of the Thai officials. 
  The Cairns Group now is working out what areas the group has 
to include after the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of world 
trade talks. 
  The Cairns Group was formed out of concern that the Gatt 
members would not include a farm agreement at the latest round 
of Gatt talks. But though the round has concluded with a 
requirement for subsidy cuts on farm products, the Cairns Group 
has decided not to abolish the grouping but continue to work as 
a supervisory body to push for free farm trade in the 
post-Uruguay Round environment. 
  Thailand was assigned to conduct a feasibility study of fish 
and fisheries products, said Kanitson Nawanukhro, deputy 
director-general of the Business Economics Department. He said 
at a press conference after the Cairns meeting that Thailand 
would like to add fish and fisheries products to the farm 
products category. 
  "If Thailand's effort is successful, it means that Thailand 
will have more access to the fisheries products market," he said. 
  Fish resources are the main interest of Thailand and many 
countries in the group. But the recent Gatt agreement does not 
force its members to liberalize the fisheries trade, leaving an 
opportunity for some countries to unfairly restrict fishery 
imports. 
  Thailand also will work with New Zealand in working out a 
framework proposal to prevent the export of subsidized goods and 
food aid that distort international trade. 
  On other countries: 
  Argentina: responsible for conducting a primary study on 
market dumping and export subsidies not stated in Article 9 and 
their impact to be used as a guideline under the World Trade 
Organization. 
  Canada: seeking a mechanism to review and monitor the 
agriculture policy under the agriculture committee. 
  Brazil and Colombia: considering the impact of the Green Box 
Policies peace clauses and the condition to use the protection 
measure for farm products, and evaluating the new dispute 
settlement mechanism of the Cairns Group. 
  Brazil and Chile: studying how to promote goods, including 
processed food products and fruit, which will benefit the group.

  [Excerpt] A claim that Thailand is providing military 
support to the Khmer Rouge reflects the frustration of the 
international community at the situation in Cambodia, Deputy 
Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan said yesterday. 
  The international community expected to see peace in 
Cambodia 
after the United Nations-organised elections in May last year, 
Mr Surin said. 
  "When things do not go well, they try to find a reason for 
it. One easy reason is (to allege that) the Khmer Rouge is 
receiving assistance from Thailand." 
  The deputy foreign minister was commenting on an article 
written by former US ambassador to Thailand Morton Abramowitz in 
THE WASHINGTON POST on May 29. 
  In the article, Mr Abramowitz said the Khmer Rouge had 
established control over areas in northern and western Cambodia. 
  "The ineffectiveness of the Phnom Penh government and an 
ill-conceived military campaign are key reasons for Khmer Rouge 
successes. But a major external factor is Thailand's help for 
the Khmer Rouge," he wrote. 
  "The Thai military provides them goods and, reportedly, arms 
and gives their leadership sanctuary," Mr Abramowitz said. 
  But Mr Surin commented that the author may be "holding on to 
an old image" of the Khmer Rouge as a member of a tripartite 
coalition which fought against the former Phnom Penh government. 
  There is no need for Thailand to respond to the allegation 
as 
the author "has a right to express his opinion," Mr Surin said. 
  It was Thailand's policy "not to support any one faction," 
the deputy minister stressed. Thailand "wants to see national 
reconciliation take place in Cambodia as soon as possible". 
  "Some foreign countries now understand Thailand's position," 
he said. He refused to give names but said they included 
Western countries. 
  Mr Abramowitz also suggested that the U.S. raise its 
concerns 
about Cambodia during pending dialogue in Bangkok with the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations. 
  The deputy minister welcomed the suggestion, saying: "It is 
better than discussing the issue outside the region." 
  The U.S. is one of ASEAN's seven "dialogue partners" and is 
due to join an 18-nation forum on security issues taking place 
on July 25. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The foreign minister, Squadron Leader Prasong 
Sunsiri, is attending the 11th meeting of the Nonaligned 
Movement [NAM] foreign ministers in Cairo, Egypt, from 31 May to 
3 June. This a big meeting for NAM, the first in two years 
time, and the purpose of is to follow up important projects and 
propose new plans for the next summit meeting. A new president 
to replace Indonesia, whose term is expiring, will be elected. 
The Egyptian president presided at the opening session the 
morning of 31 May. In his opening address, he called upon the 
movement to adjust its position in keeping with global changes. 
The movement should focus now on cooperation in economic 
development rather than security issues. 
  That same day, the Thai foreign minister had a meeting with 
the Burmese foreign minister who informed Thailand that Burma 
was in the process of releasing Thai fishermen through steps 
taken by the Thai-Burmese border committee. The Thai foreign 
minister thanked the Burmese minister and confirmed Thailand's 
invitation to him to attend the opening of the ASEAN foreign 
ministers' meeting in Thailand in July as a guest of the Thai 
foreign minister. The Burmese foreign minister accepted the 
invitation. 
  On bilateral relations, both sides agreed to strengthen 
mechanisms for cooperation. The two sides also exchanged 
information on the construction of a bridge across the Moei 
River in Mae Sot District, Tak Province. Thailand sent 
technicians to Burma to discuss the project. Burma assigned its 
minister of construction to be in charge of the project.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Burmese Border Situation"] </F>
  [Text] Thailand must keep a close watch on all 
developments in connection with the ongoing fighting between the 
Burmese Government troops and the Shan force under the 
leadership of the world infamous drug kingpin Khun Sa or Chang 
Sifu. This is to avoid falling into any undesirable situation, 
like the case of the fighting in Cambodia -- accusations from 
Cambodian leaders. 
  Latest reports indicate that Khun Sa's multiethnic force, 
comprising heavily of armed Shan, Chinese Haw, and Karen 
soldiers, successfully captured the major government's 
stronghold in Kengtung on 28 May after the 20-hours of fierce 
battle that erupted the day before. 
  It is believed that some 7,000 well-equipped men under Khun 
Sa's command have now gained full control of Kengtung after 
having slain 160 Burmese soldiers and wounded 310 others, while 
2,000 others fled their bases in disarray. 
  Kengtung is situated some 120 kilometers north of the border 
district of Mae Sai, Chiang Rai Province. At present, some 
1,200 Burmese civilians are seeking refuge in the district and 
the number is expected to increase. 
  U.S. narcotics suppression officials have estimated the 
total 
opium production in the areas under Khun Sa's control in 1992 at 
2,280 tons, with the output expected to rise in later years. 
  It should be noted that the route traffickers used to ship 
heroin and opium from the Golden Triangle and nearby areas to 
the world market in the past five years has been shifted from 
Thailand to China. The success of the narcotics suppression 
operation in Thailand has shifted this severe problem into China. 
  It is possible that Khun Sa has been able to sell more 
heroin 
and opium to the world market in the past few years. 
Subsequently, he has been able to improve the efficiency of his 
army in terms of both manpower and equipment. We notice that 
Khun Sa's men easily defeated the Burmese troops in recent 
battles. 
  In any event, Thailand should be aware of problems it can 
have with Burma, a neighboring country like Cambodia. Frequent 
victories by Khun Sa's army over the Burmese Government troops 
can spark off suspicion on part of the Burmese Government as 
Cambodian leaders have always blamed Thailand for every defeat 
their troops have suffered from the Khmer Rouge.

  [Text] The Commerce Ministry is considering whether to 
accept the offer from the Iraqi government which proposed to buy 
an additional 500,000 tonnes of Thai rice, but the payment will 
be made only after the country's frozen assets are released from 
the United Nations. 
  Mr. Pridiyathon Thewakun, President of the Exim 
[Export-Import] Bank, said that he was assigned by the Commerce 
Ministry to consider the business risks from selling Thai rice 
to Iraq. One of the factors subject to consideration is the 
amount of the Iraqi assets being frozen by the international 
organization so far, and how many lending countries are planning 
to snatch the money after the assets are released. 
  A source from the Commerce Ministry said that if the deal is 
approved, Thailand might be able to sell as much as 1.5 million 
tonnes of Thai rice during the period, considering that, Iraq 
aside, Thailand has received the offers from Iran to exchange 
500,000 tonnes of 100 percent white rice for crude oil. 
Indonesia and the Philippines also proposed to buy an equal 
volume of 300,000 tonnes of rice, while Japan has delivered the 
latest rice order covering 200,000 tonnes.

  [Text] Thailand yesterday renewed its call for the 
establishment of a reception centre in Laos as a way of speeding 
up the repatriation of some 12,000 Laotians. 
  Praphakon Samiti, director of the Interior Ministry's 
Foreign 
Affairs Division, made the call before international 
participants at a technical meeting convened by the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). 
  Mr Praphakon said the repatriation of the refugees had 
gathered momentum but pointed out that some 9,000 Laotians were 
"expected" to remain in Thailand after the planned closure of 
Ban Napho camp at the end of this year. 
  "I do hope that all parties concerned will join to put more 
effort into solving the residual caseload," he said. 
  Questions of repatriation and resettlement are being 
discussed at the two-day technical meeting called to seek ways 
of clearing camps in first asylum countries of some 80,000 
Indochinese by the end of next year when the Comprehensive Plan 
of Action (CPA) drawn up in 1989 expires. 
  The technical discussions have drawn representatives from 
Vietnam and Laos as well as first asylum, resettlement and donor 
countries -- including Austria, Australia, Belgium, Brunei, 
Canada, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Netherlands, New 
Zealand, Norway, United Kingdom, United States and European 
Union. 
  Mr. Praphakon expressed hope that the idea of setting up a 
reception centre in Laos would be pursued at a meeting 
comprising Thailand, Laos and the UNHCR due to take place later 
this month. 
  The centre will house returnees pending determination of a 
permanent resettlement site, he said. Elaborating on the idea 
in a separate interview, Mr Praphakon said it would function as 
a "halfway house" where skills training could be provided to the 
returnees. 
  The UNHCR's Thailand representative Ruprecht von Arnim said 
he was open to the idea. But he emphasised the need to address 
the Laotian Government's concerns about employment for the 
returnees. 
  Vientiane will not accept a simple "transfer" of Ban Napho 
to 
Laos and the UNHCR will find it difficult arriving at an 
arrangement which might become an "open-ended commitment", he 
said. 
  Mr Praphakon said Thailand would complete the process of 
status determination of Vietnamese encamped in the country by 
June 24. 
  He said some 6,000 Vietnamese were expected to sign up for 
voluntary repatriation by the end of this month. 
  But he pointed to some 3,000 hard core cases which would be 
more difficult to deal with, and called for a stepped-up 
campaign to encourage them to volunteer for repatriation. 
  He also urged resettlement countries to live up to their 
pledges and drew attention to the estimated 250 Vietnamese 
encamped at Sikhiu who have been "screened-in" as bona fide 
refugees but rejected.

<F P=106> [By Manirat Chitsamakun] </F>
  [Text] The Board of Investment (BoI) yesterday took a major 
step to promote supporting industries in Thailand by announcing 
benefits for an additional 10 industrial categories, mostly 
small and medium-sized firms, in an attempt to attract at least 
5,000 Japanese plants to Thailand. 
  Moreover, the board, chaired by Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai, 
will also allow an additional 20 industries, including auto 
parts, electronic products, plastic products and rubber 
products, to be located in the Zone 2 investment area. The BoI, 
however, has yet to rule whether to grant privileges to the 
fertilizer and ceramic industries under the second 
classification of the BoI promotional privileges. 
  The BoI's latest move is seen as a response to investors' 
complaints over inadequate infrastructure in the remote 
provinces under so-called Zone 3. 
  Although the government tried to promote investment by 
offering a first-class incentive package for those who wish to 
set up plants in those provinces some investors have been 
reluctant to go there because the provinces are too far away. 
  At a press conference yesterday, Sathaphon Kawitanon, BoI 
secretary-general, said the BoI board has agreed to grant an 
eight-year corporate tax exemption to those who wish to set up 
plants for engineering plastic parts, rechargeable batteries, 
electronic connectors, machining centres, heat treatment, 
surface treatment, sintered products, grinding tools, cutting 
tools and toolings, regardless of where the industries are 
located. 
  Yesterday's announcement has added to the list of industries 
BoI approved on October 26 last year. Then, the BoI offered 
maximum benefits to four industries -- moulds and dies, jigs and 
fixtures, forging, casting and induction furnaces. Sathaphon 
said that the incentive worked quite well as it helped increase 
factories in the four industries from only one to 12. 
  Sathaphon said that this should help promote small-and 
medium-scale industries, which are the foundation for economic 
development. He said that it is coincidental that the yen has 
appreciated, which is expected to prompt small and medium firms 
in Japan to relocate their plants to low-cost countries. 
  BoI recently conducted a seminar in Japan and found that 
there were about 1 million small and medium plants there. "If we 
can get just 1-2 percent of the total or only 5,000 factories, 
the opportunity among local industries to get transfer of 
technology will be tremendous," he said. 
  The 20 industries which the BoI allowed to be set up in the 
Zone 2 investment area are leather tannery, wheel tyre, rubber, 
glass, carpet, leather products, footwear and parts, toys and 
electronic games, box or packaging products, metal-made 
containers, leather gloves, lenses or glasses, metal items, 
metal string, auto parts, energy-saving light tubes, batteries, 
electronic products, soft gelatine capsules and plastic or 
plastic-coated products.

  [Excerpt] Foreign borrowings by Thai banks hit a record 
high in the first four months of this year with the amount 
doubling from last year to Bt140 billion, the Bank of Thailand 
reported. 
  Thai banks have resorted to overseas loans to fund domestic 
credit which reached Bt200 billion in the same period, as the 
outstanding deposits fell by about Bt20 billion compared to the 
end of last year. 
  The Bangkok Bank saw its deposit fall by Bt23.4 billion 
during this period, with the First Bangkok City Bank witnessing 
a drop of Bt4.9 billion, the Bangkok Metropolitan Bank a Bt4.6 
billion drop, Bangkok Bank of Commerce Bt4.4 billion, Siam 
Commercial Bank Bt2.5 billion, Union Bank Bt900 million, and 
Thai Thanu Bank Bt35 million. 
  It is the first time that half of the banks saw their 
deposits eroded as finances were largely diverted to mutual 
funds and equity investment. 
  According to Phisit Li-atham, the central bank spokesman, 
the 
banks showed outstanding deposits of Bt2.37 billion at the end 
of April, an increase of 14.4 per cent compared to the same 
period last year, and Bt23 billion compared with the end of last 
year. Deposits usually grow at an annual rate of 19-20 per cent. 
  The general picture, though, is not to bad. The 91 local 
finance companies in the first quarter chalked up outstanding 
deposits of Bt595.69 billion, an increase of 37.73 per cent 
compared with the same period last year and Bt54 billion higher 
then the end of 1993. 
  The finance companies market share, of the financial sector, 
rose from 18.4 percent at the end of 1993 to 20.2 percent at the 
end of this year's first quarter. The banks' market share fell 
from 81.6 percent to 79.8 percent and is expected to decrease 
further when the half-year figures are announced. [passage

  [Text] Wearied by mounting anti-nuclear sentiment, the lack 
of a clear government policy and prohibitive investment costs, 
state energy planners are dropping their controversial plan to 
build Thailand's first nuclear power plant. 
  The move is apparent in the new power plant development 
project master plan being revised by the Electricity Generating 
Authority of Thailand (EGAT), from which the nuclear option has 
been deleted along with other problematic schemes. 
  According to Nopphadon Salitdisuk assistant chief of EGAT's 
generation system development planning division, the authority 
does not wish to proceed with the plan, which saw the first two 
of six 1,000-megawatt nuclear power units being commissioned in 
2006. 
  Mr Nopphadon said yesterday that EGAT will not seek to 
undertake the nuclear project at least in the period 1994-2011, 
making the possibility of such a project being implemented look 
remote. 
  Other "less socially sensitive" and conventional thermal 
power houses, using for instance imported natural gas and coal, 
will substitute for the suspended nuclear plant scheme, he said. 
  He cited the lack of public acceptance of nuclear power 
plants as the prime factor behind EGAT's decision to withdraw 
the plan. 
  But he said that the project may not be abandoned entirely, 
and EGAT will continue to study various aspects so that "when 
the time of public acceptance comes" the project can be 
relaunched. 
  Prathin Phatthanaphon, deputy governor of the Petroleum 
Authority of Thailand (PTT), yesterday confirmed EGAT's move. 
  He said that among other things, the question of safety is 
uppermost in the minds of the public, and the extremely high 
investment cost of the nuclear facilities make the project 
itself financially unviable. 
  The cost of building a nuclear power plant is some US$2,000 
per kilowatt compared to $1,200 for one using imported coal and 
$650 for a combined cycle plant fuelled by natural gas. 
  Dr Phiyasawat Amranan, deputy secretary general of the 
National Energy Policy Office, said the Government does not need 
to come to a decision today on whether to proceed with the 
nuclear project because there is still insufficient information 
with which to make a decision. 
  "We have 12 years before the planned nuclear power plant is 
envisaged. We still have a few more years (to decide)," he said. 
  But Dr Phiyasawat, a key state energy planner, suggested to 
Business Post that nuclear energy is destined to have a lower 
priority in the overal] near-term energy plan. 
  There are energy alternatives which can be made available to 
meet the country's fast-growing electricity demand more easily 
than nuclear, he said. 
  "Why don't we first look into imported coal and LNG 
(liquefied natural gas)? More natural gas from the Gulf of 
Thailand will become available for power plant fuels," he said. 
"Furthermore, there is the potential for increasing power supply 
to Thailand from hydro-electric projects in Laos, and there is 
potential for tapping huge hydro-electric resources in Burma," 
he added. 
  State energy planners' latest stance on nuclear energy comes 
less than three months after Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said 
Thailand may have to take the nuclear option in order to arrest 
the country's fastgrowing electricity demand. 
  In his first public remarks on whether Thailand should build 
nuclear power plants, the Premier said the Government can 
neither overlook nor reject nuclear as a possible source of 
power generation. 
  Alternative energy sources for Thailand have their 
limitations, Mr Chuan said, while acknowledging public concern 
about the safety risks and the high cost of nuclear power. 
  Mr Chuan said public sentiment on the issue will be the most 
important factor deciding whether nuclear plants should be built 
here. 
  The World Bank has suggested that Thailand drop its nuclear 
power plant project, which it sees as more expensive than other 
options. 
  It advises Thailand to turn to natural gas, particularly 
imported LNG, and insists that nuclear power be considered only 
as a last option.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 3 (YONHAP) -- North Korean Ambassador to 
Austria Kim Kwang-sop visited the headquarters of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Thursday and conveyed 
his country's official position on problems related to IAEA 
inspections, it was reported here Friday. 
  In a dispatch from Vienna, the MAINICHI SHIMBUN said Kim had 
formally handed a North Korean Foreign Ministry statement to top 
IAEA officials. 
  Kim made it clear that Pyongyang will have no alternative 
but 
to leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) if the 
international community imposes economic sanctions, the 
newspaper said. 
  Saying it was unusual for a North Korean ambassador to hold 
talks with top IAEA officials, MAINICHI said some observers view 
Pyongyang's move as an indication that it has begun efforts to 
avoid a breakdown in IAEA inspections. 
  Meanwhile, Yun Ho-chin, councilor at the North Korean 
Embassy 
in Vienna, told MAINICHI Thursday that his country is in a 
special position where it is suspending its decision to withdraw 
from the NPT. 
  Yun said, "from a legal point of view, North Korea has 
already left the treaty, but it is trying to resolve the nuclear 
dispute politically within the NPT framework. 
  "That is why North Korea is allowing the IAEA to service 
surveillance cameras in order to help maintain the continuity of 
nuclear safeguards." 
  With regard to the refueling of the 5-megawatt reactor in 
Yongbyon, Yun claimed that North Korea's method of preserving 
the spent fuel rods has been proven in earlier experiments to 
allow for accurate checking later. 
  "When the IAEA insists on its own way of checking, it is the 
same as trying to chase us out of the NPT," Yun said, hinting 
that North Korea would even leave the regime completely if it 
could not reach an inspection agreement with the IAEA.

  [Text] Moscow, June 3 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam, 
in a telephone conversation Friday morning, instructed Prime 
Minister Yi Yong-tok to take all necessary steps in connection 
with the U.N. move to slap sanctions on North Korea. 
  He gave the instruction after receiving reports on the 
latest 
developments in the North Korean nuclear issue from Chief of 
Staff Pak Kwang-yong in Seoul and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu 
and foreign affairs and security aide Chong Chong-uk in Moscow. 
  Tension over Pyongyang's nuclear program is mounting as the 
U.N. Security Council moves toward sanctions against the 
Stalinist state, and the government should be scrupulous in 
dealing with such tension, presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik 
quoted Kim as telling Prime Minister Yi. 
  The transparency of North Korea's nuclear development 
program 
must be guaranteed under all circumstances, and on this 
principle the government should maintain close cooperation with 
the United States and Japan in considering future action, 
President Kim said. 
  Kim asked Prime Minister Yi to ensure that the people can go 
about their business with full trust in the government and 
without any sense of crisis.

  [Text] Seoul, June 3 (YONHAP) -- Deputy Prime Minister Yi 
Hong-ku said on Friday an economic sanction against North Korea 
would be unavoidable unless there is a change in Pyongyang's 
attitude with regard to the nuclear question. 
  "I understand the concrete time and method of a sanction 
will 
be determined after the U.N. Security Council studied a report 
from Hans Blix, director-general of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA)." 
  Yi, concurrent national unification minister, made the 
remarks at a working luncheon with the members of the foreign 
policy, unification and security subcommittee of the ruling 
Democratic Liberal Party's special committee for the buildup of 
international competitiveness. 
  He indicated that even if China were shy of taking part in a 
sanction, Seoul and its major allies could mount an effective 
sanction. 
  "China's particpation in an international sanction is 
desirable," Yi said. "But, it is obvious that even if China does 
not take part, an economic sanction by South Korea and its major 
allies like the United States and Japan would deal North Korea a 
serious blow."

  [Text] Seoul, June 3 (YONHAP) -- The main opposition 
Democratic Party [DP] Friday urged the government to tread 
carefully in taking punitive action against North Korea due to 
the standoff over Pyongyang's nuclear program, warning that 
sanctions could lead to war on the Korean peninsula. 
  "The recent situation is heading towards a critical phase in 
which the (whole) nation could collapse concurrently," concluded 
a meeting of DP lawmakers affiliated with the National Assembly 
Foreign Affairs and National Unification and National Defense 
Committees. 
  During the meeting presided over by party Chairman Yi 
Ki-taek, it was decided to hold an emergency meeting of DP 
lawmakers Friday to announce the party's official position on 
the North Korean nuclear issue and call on the ruling Democratic 
Liberal Party to convene relevant National Assembly committees 
to deal with the issue. 
  The DP lawmakers also decided to demand that the North 
immediately stop playing the "foolhardy" nuclear card to head 
off any possibility of a crisis developing on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The opposition lawmakers agreed that if the need arises, 
sanctions must be imposed on the North by the United Nations 
Security Council through resolutions based on a global consensus 
rather than through an initiative by South Korea, the United 
States and Japan alone. 
  They also pointed out that armed conflict could erupt on the 
Korean peninsula if economic sanctions were imposed, considering 
that a sea blockade would be necessary for effective 
implementation.

  [Text] Seoul, June 3 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government is preparing for the imposition of sanctions on 
Pyongyang, judging that punishment of North Korea has become 
inevitable since the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
officially announced that later measurement of discharged fuel 
rods at a disputed reactor in North Korea has become impossible. 
  The government, in particular, is seriously considering 
gradual suspension of inter-Korean trade, amounting to 180 
million U.S. dollars per year. 
  The issue was discussed at a policy coordination meeting on 
national unification and security chaired by Deputy Prime 
Minister Yi Hong-ku Friday [3 June] morning at the South-North 
dialogue secretariat in Samchong-tong, Seoul. 
  Yi, who is concurrently minister of the National Unification 
Board, said through board spokesman Kim Hyong-ki that "the 
international community is already taking the course of imposing 
sanctions against North Korea," adding that the government is 
studying various sanctions against Pyongyang. 
  Yi is the first high-ranking government official to comment 
officially that sanctions are being studied against North Korea. 
  "The participants in the meeting shared the recognition that 
the North Korean nuclear issue has turned into a more serious 
situation," he said. "We are facing a grave challenge in our 
efforts to find a peaceful solution to the nuclear problem." 
  In a related development, the government will hold a meeting 
soon with the United States and Japan to discuss sanctions 
against the North. The meeting will be attended by Korean 
Nuclear Affairs Ambassador Kim Sam-hun, U.S. Assistant Secretary 
of State Robert Gallucci and Deputy Director-General Yukio 
Takeuchi of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's Asian Affairs Bureau. 
  The tripartite meeting is expected to touch on the Japanese 
Government's prohibition of remittances to North Korea by 
pro-Pyongyang Koreans in Japan who belong to a group called 
Chochongnyon [General Association of Korean Residents in Japan], 
which sends North Korea 60 billion-80 billion yen per year. 
  In addition, the meeting is likely to discuss military 
build-up programs in preparation for any emergency on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Other government officials here said that "the time to 
discuss whether or not to impose sanctions has already passed," 
emphasizing the inevitability of sanctions. "We will, however, 
have close consultations with our allies on detailed procedures 
and timing," they added.

  [Text] The ROK Government has decided to take phased and 
gradual sanction measures on North Korea, including the complete 
suspension of indirect trade with North Korea, when the 
international community begins imposing sanctions on North Korea. 
  The government held a policy coordination meeting on 
reunification and security on the morning of 3 June presided 
over by Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and minister of the 
National Unification Board [NUB], to discuss the government's 
measures to prepare for the stage of imposing sanctions on North 
Korea. The government has decided to suspend indirect trade and 
ban civilian companies from contacting North Korean residents in 
a third country. 
  The government has established a policy to focus diplomatic 
efforts on drawing out a UN Security Council's resolution 
concerning sanctions on North Korea and to request cooperation 
from permanent member states of the council, including the PRC. 
The government reportedly discussed imposing multinational 
sanctions pivoted by Western countries, including the Untied 
States and Japan, if the PRC vetoes the adoption of the 
resolution against North Korea. 
  The government will convey the finalized position at the 
working-level meeting between the ROK, the United States, and 
Japan to be held in Washington tomorrow. 
  After today's coordination meeting, NUB Spokesman Kim 
Yong-ki 
said in a statement that the government's efforts for a peaceful 
resolution is seriously challenged by North Korea's attitude, 
that the international community is already taking steps to 
enter the sanctions stage, and that our government is also 
considering various effective measures of sanctions on North 
Korea. 
  Spokesman Kim urged North Korea to abandon the reckless 
attitude of confrontation against the whole world and said that 
the government will seek measures to prepare for various 
situations anticipated while watching the results of 
negotiations between the ROK and the United States on the tense 
development of the situation concerning the North Korean nuclear 
issue.

  [Text] Seoul, June 3 (YONHAP) -- China virtually expressed 
its opposition to UN sanctions against North Korea despite the 
breakdown in nuclear inspection talks, advising more dialogue in 
a meeting with South Korean officials Friday. 
  Tang Jiaxuan, Chinese deputy foreign minister, was quoted as 
telling his South Korean counterpart Pak Kon-wu that Beijing 
does "understand that Seoul has to seek other methods than 
dialogue to deal with the North Korean nuclear issue," a Foreign 
Ministry official said after their three-hour meeting. 
  "But Tang advised diplomatic negotiations no matter how 
difficult the situation may become," the official said. 
  The North Korean nuclear crisis has taken a turn for the 
worse during Tang's visit. The International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) declared that it has now become impossible to 
measure the fuel rods from the North's nuclear reactor and thus 
to verify whether or not the communist state diverted plutonium, 
the core ingredient in making nuclear bombs. 
  Washington immediately announced it would seek UN sanctions, 
and South Korean officials said the direction has now turned 
from diplomatic negotiations to punitive measures. 
  Tang's remarks are the first from Beijing since this latest 
development. China, a permanent member of the Security Council, 
remains the uncertain variable as the council prepares to adopt 
a resolution sometime next week against North Korea. 
  "South Korea implied that there is a limit to dialogue 
efforts," said the Foreign Ministry official, who declined to be 
named. 
  Tang agreed with Pak that the current North Korean situation 
is urgent and of great concern, but the Chinese official advised 
further dialogue, he said. 
  "Tang emphasized the importance of peace and stability on 
the 
Korean peninsula, the importance of a nuclear-free Korea," said 
the official. "He said diplomatic negotiations would be a far 
better option since pushing North Korea may only complicate 
matters."

<F P=106> [Interview with Zhang Tingyan, PRC ambassador to the ROK, in </F>
his office in Myongdong, Seoul, by Pyon Chang-sop -- date not 
given, first paragraph is editor's note] 
  [Text] Zhang Tingyan (58), Chinese ambassador to the ROK, 
who speaks fluent Korean, recently received many requests from 
universities and public organizations throughout the country to 
give a lecture on ROK-PRC relations. Thus, he is in high 
spirits. Such requests reflect the Korean people's increasing 
interest in China, although it has only been one year and nine 
months since the ROK and China established diplomatic relations. 
Moreover, with the North Korean threat in March 1993 that it 
will withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], 
the North Korean nuclear problem has been the focus of the 
people's attention. As a result, Ambassador Zhang has a busier 
schedule than any other ambassador in Seoul. With his 34 years 
of diplomatic service, he is known to be one of the outstanding 
professional diplomats within the Chinese Foreign Ministry. In 
particular, he served in the Chinese Embassy in North Korea for 
a total of 17 years from 1960 to 1969; from 1976 to 1981, and 
from 1986 to 1989. Thus, he is known as an expert in North 
Korean affairs. He came to Seoul as the first Chinese ambassador 
to the ROK in September 1992. The reporter met him in his office 
in Myongdong, Seoul and asked him about current issues 
surrounding the North Korean nuclear problem. 
  [Pyon Chang-sop] What efforts did the Chinese Government 
make to solve the North Korean nuclear problem in the past? 
  [Ambassador Zhang Tingyan] The position of the Chinese 
Government is to support the denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula. When the North Korean nuclear problem broke out in 
March 1993, the Chinese Government made all possible efforts for 
a solution to this problem. In other words, the Chinese 
Government held consultations with nations concerned, including 
the ROK and the United States. The Chinese Government hopes that 
the problem will be solved through dialogue, not pressure. 
Although China is not the nation directly concerned, it made 
efforts to solve this problem, and will make such efforts in the 
future, too. Certain progress has been made in solving the 
North Korean nuclear problem. The United States and North Korea 
made contacts in New York for a third round of talks and 
negotiations are ongoing between North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. Many parties 
concerned have been working recently in a very flexible manner. 
This is what we are hoping for. We think that holding talks by 
maintaining flexibility is better than holding talks under a 
strained situation. 
  [Pyon] Will China join UN sanctions if the nuclear problem 
is not solved through dialogue? 
  [Ambassador Zhang] When we recall the North Korean nuclear 
problem during the past one year, we note that there were many 
difficult crises. However, the crises were resolved each time 
through dialogue, not by pressure. If my memory is correct, the 
ROK Government, from the outset, also chose resolution of the 
nuclear problem through dialogue. In March last year, Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu said at a reception that the nuclear 
problem should be resolved through dialogue. I understand that 
his remarks represent the ROK Government position. The Chinese 
Government position is the same as the ROK. It is important to 
solve the nuclear problem in a peaceful manner. When President 
Kim Yong-sam visited China and held a summit with President 
Jiang Zemin last March, they reached an agreement to resolve the 
North Korean nuclear problem through dialogue. There were many 
cases of international disputes throughout the world. However, 
most of the problems were resolved by dialogue, not by means of 
pressure. In particular, a solution to disputes through dialogue 
has become the trend of the time since the end of the Cold War. 
  [Pyon] Has China acted as a mediator for direct dialogue 
between the United States and North Korea? 
  [Ambassador Zhang] There is an official high-level dialogue 
channel between the United States and North Korea. China has 
never played the role of mediator, nor is there such a necessity. 
  [Pyon] It was learned that when the ROK and China 
established diplomatic relations in August 1992, China put 
forward the establishment of North Korean-U.S. diplomatic 
relations as a precondition for ROK-China diplomatic relations. 
Is this true? 
  [Ambassador Zhang] China's establishment of diplomatic 
relations with the ROK is entirely for normalization of 
relations between the two countries. China has never put forward 
any condition. 
  [Pyon] Do you think there is the possibility of 
establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States 
and North Korea? 
  [Ambassador Zhang] I think that peace and stability on the 
Korean peninsula are hoped for not only by the Korean people but 
also by many nations of the world. Therefore, I think that for 
peace and stability to exist on the Korean peninsula, the United 
States must establish diplomatic relations with North Korea. 
Although I am not certain about actual establishment of 
U.S.-North Korean diplomatic relations, I believe that there 
will undoubtedly be progress in their relations. 
  [Pyon] A rumor on a crisis on the Korean peninsula 
surrounding the North Korean nuclear issue has recently been 
spread. What is your view on this, Mr. Ambassador? 
  [Ambassador Zhang] I do not think it is a crisis. crisis 
means that the Korean peninsula is in a danger of war and the 
present situation is not a crisis. If a war breaks out, it would 
not be favorable for either side. It appears that the rumor on 
such a crisis was prompted by incorrect judgment of the 
situation. As the judgment is erroneous, expressions of the 
crisis would have possibly been exaggerated. 
  [Pyon] Does the Chinese Government know if North Korea 
possesses nuclear weapons? 
  [Ambassador Zhang] The Chinese Government does not know if 
North Korea has nuclear weapons. We do not agree that the North 
or the South has nuclear weapons. 
  [Pyon] Many people believe that China has influence over 
North Korea, and it is true even now... 
  [Ambassador Zhang] China is engaged in large-scale trade 
with 
North Korea. We offer not only oil, but also coal to North 
Korea. However, this is aimed at developing relations with North 
Korea, not at securing influence. China pursues relations with 
other countries based on equality, mutual respect, and trust. 
Chinese relations with North Korea have been realized on the 
basis of this principle. North Korea is a sovereign state. 
North Korea does not necessarily discuss with China when it 
formulates and implements a policy. China does not make such a 
demand nor expect such discussions because such an act is 
regarded as interference in others' domestic affairs. We never 
force any other country to follow our will. 
  [Pyon] Does China convey the position of the ROK or the 
United States pertaining to the North Korean nuclear problem to 
North Korea, or has China done so before? 
  [Ambassador Zhang] I think that the possibility of doing 
this will increase in the future. It can be regarded as part of 
normal diplomatic negotiations to convey one's will to the 
other. China has done so in the past. 
  [Pyon] Relations between the North and the South have been 
deadlocked due to the North Korean nuclear problem. What is your 
view on this, Mr. Ambassador? 
  [Ambassador Zhang] The Chinese Government hopes that 
North-South relations will improve. However, North-South 
relations are a problem that should be resolved between the 
parties concerned in the North and the South. 
  [Pyon] Some time ago, there was a report that the Chinese 
Government invited President Kim Il-song to visit. Can you 
confirm this? 
  [Ambassador Zhang] It is true that the Chinese Government 
invited him early this year. However, there was no reply. I am 
not sure when his visit will be realized. 
  [Pyon] There was also a report that China acted as a 
mediator for realization of North-South summit talks between 
Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Kim Il-song. In addition, some 
people believed that the recent visit of Wu Xueqian, former 
Chinese vice premier and foreign minister, to Seoul was intended 
to mediate the North-South summit. Is this true? 
  [Ambassador Zhang] Such a report is also totally groundless. 
The visit of Wu Xueqian, former Chinese vice premier and foreign 
minister, was aimed at consolidating friendship with the ROK. 
When former vice premier Wu served as foreign minister, he got 
acquainted with many Korean friends in Seoul. Yi Se-ki, national 
assemblyman from the Democratic Liberal Party, is one of them. 
The Chinese Government has not played the role of mediator nor 
is there such a necessity. Besides, the ROK Government has not 
asked China to play such a role, nor will it ask in the future. 
  [Pyon] Is it possible that President Jiang Zemin will 
visit the ROK within this year? 
  [Ambassador Zhang] I cannot be positive at present. Even 
though President Jiang himself said "Now, it is my turn to visit 
the ROK," he has been so busy with Chinese domestic issues that 
he has hardly had time to fix a date. As for myself as an 
ambassador, I hope he will come to Seoul as soon as possible. 
(In this connection, TONG-A ILBO has recently reported by 
quoting a diplomatic source in Beijing that President Jiang is 
scheduled to visit the ROK in November. However, (Chin Chi), 
first secretary at the Chinese Embassy in the ROK who is 
responsible for public information, held that "The embassy has 
not received any notice from the home government on this 
matter." A working-level official at the Foreign Ministry also 
denied the report by saying that "We are pushing ahead with a 
plan to realize President Jiang's visit to the ROK within this 
year." 
  [Pyon] Recently, North Korea is holding that the present 
Armistice Agreement should be replaced with a peace agreement. 
What is the Chinese Government's stance on this matter? 
  [Ambassador Zhang] The U.S. Government has not yet clarified 
its stance on this matter. This is an issue that needs to be 
resolved among the North and South, and the United States. I 
think it is imperative to review the issue of substituting the 
armistice state for the peace state and this is the right time 
to do so. The replacement of a peace agreement should be 
reexamined for the sake of peace and security on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  [Pyon] What do you think about the notion on `the threat 
from 
China' which is prevailing now in Asia? 
  [Ambassador Zhang] Those who talk about such a thing do not 
know about our policy or the real situation. Maybe they have 
other purposes for saying that. With the collapse of the Soviet 
Union, many people believed that China would also follow that 
path. However, not only did China not collapse, but it is 
becoming more stable. Even if China becomes powerful, it would 
not pursue hegemonism nor high-handed policies. By 2049, the 
year when China greets the 100th anniversary of the foundation 
of the PRC, China will reach the middle stage in the course of 
economic development. This is our goal at this moment. Even now 
in China, 80 million people among the 1.16 billion population 
suffer from poverty. 
  [Pyon] As the first Chinese ambassador to the ROK, how do 
you 
evaluate present ROK-Chinese relations? 
  [Ambassador Zhang] Even though it has only been one year and 
nine months since China and the ROK established diplomatic 
relations, the two countries have accumulated remarkable 
achievements during this period. Above all, the leaders of the 
two countries found common ground at their summit in Seattle and 
Beijing. To put it in a Korean way, they have established deep 
rapport. In the economic sector, the volume of trade increased 
a great deal, reaching $9.1 billion last year. Now, China has 
become the third largest trade partner. 
  [Pyon] What was the most worthwhile job you have done while 
in office? 
  [Ambassador Zhang] During my short term of office, I am most 
pleased with the fact that I was able to accomplish many things. 
I deem it as a great honor to have played a role of promoting 
the relations between the ROK and China. As the relations 
between the two countries are getting better, trust between the 
peoples of the two countries are deepened all the more. 
Recently, I have received many lecture requests from 
universities and social organizations. This reflects the Korean 
people's increased interest in China.

  [Text] Experts on plant quarantine from Korea and the 
United States got together for a two-day meeting at the National 
Plant Quarantine Service (NPQS) in Anyang city, Kyonggi 
Province, yesterday. 
  The annual phytosanitary meeting, the fifth of its kind, 
deals with technical issues like pest control and treatments for 
agricultural and forestry products whose overseas shipments have 
been banned because of pests or diseases. 
  At the meeting, the Korean side is expected to ask the 
United 
States to issue import permits for four kinds of Korean fruits 
and seven sorts of vegetables. 
  Among the requested items are apples, unshu oranges 
(tangerines), persimmons, including sweet ones, and kiwis along 
with cucumbers, Oriental melons, watermelons and squashes, 
according to an NPQS official. 
  Under the provision of the International Plant Protection 
Convention, plants and plant products exported to foreign 
countries are subject to inspection if there are harmful pests 
and diseases and then the phytosanitary certificate is issued. 
  The U.S. side is expected to ask for Korea to import 
American-produced pine lumber, apples and Hawaiian papayas, 
according to the official. 
  In February this year, the Korean side presented to the 
United States' Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
(APHIS) plans to control the three kinds of pests and diseases 
affecting Korean apples that the U.S. side had raised as reasons 
for banning imports of the fruit from Korea.

  [Text] North Korea, which is troubled by escaping loggers, 
broadcast an interesting report on 1 June through its Central 
Broadcast that lumber production in Russia has decreased 
drastically. 
  Quoting data from the Russian Federal Forestry Bureau, the 
broadcasting station reported that Russia's lumber production 
last year decreased to under 75 percent of that of 1992 and that 
the situation is worsening. 
  While analyzing the decrease of lumber production as a 
result 
of the financial difficulties of the enterprise concerned and 
the soaring transportation cost, the broadcasting station 
expressed concern over suspended production due to the workers' 
strike.

  [Text] Seoul, June 2 (YONHAP) -- South Korea consumes about 
2.5 times as much energy as North Korea instead of 5 times more 
as previously known, according to a leading North Korea watcher 
in the United States. 
  Dr. Chang Yong-sik, an economics professor of New York State 
University, said in a recent report that in 1991 South Korea 
consumed 79,705,000 tons oil equivalent (TOE) of coal, oil, gas, 
charcoal and electricity while North Korea used 32,114,000 TOE. 
  The report was prepared in a contract awarded by South 
Korea's semi-official think tank, Korea Development Institute 
(KDI). It was released by KDI Thursday. 
  The energy South Korea consumed in 1991 included 17,394,000 
TOE of coal, 51,263,000 tons of oil, 1,541,000 TOE of gas, 
617,000 TOE of charcoal and 8,690,000 TOE of electricity. 
  Those used by North Korea in the same year comprised 
23,720,000 TOE of coal, 3,507,000 tons of oil, 951,000 TOE of 
charcoal and 3,932,000 TOE of electricity. 
  Per-capita energy consumption stood at 2,128 liters oil 
equivalent in the South and 1,712 liters in the North. 
  Dr. Chang claimed South Korea's National Unification Board 
earlier erroneously said South Korea used 5 times more energy 
than North Korea in 1991 due to mistakes in the conversion of 
the amount of coal production into tons oil equivalent and also 
in the calculation of electricity output. 
  As of 1991, Chang said, North Korea's energy 
self-sufficiency 
was 88 percent while it was mere 8 percent in the South. 
  However, due to the inefficiency of Pyongyang's energy 
policy 
of depending primarily on coal and a decline in oil imports 
caused by the lack of hard currencies, North Korea suffers an 
energy crisis so acute that they supply power even to Pyongyang 
on a limited basis, Chang said.

  [Text] The Seoul District Prosecutor's Office yesterday 
embarked on an intensive crackdown on publishing and printing 
companies suspected of illegally copying and using computer 
programs developed by foreign firms. 
  An investigation team led by Prosecutor Yun Hyong-yun, who 
is 
in charge of the protection of intellectual property rights, 
obtained seizure and search warrants on 11 local firms for 
full-fledged probe of their illicit business yesterday. 
  They include Tong-A Publishing and Printing Co., Samsung 
Publishing and Printing Co., Morning Glory Corp., Art Box Co., 
and Taekyo Ltd. and so on. 
  The investigators were examining computers of the companies 
to determine if they have used the foreign-made softwares they 
duplicated in violation of the law pertaining to the 
intellectual property rights. 
  The probe followed complaints [by] a group of foreign 
companies filed against the domestic firms, Prosecutor Yun said. 
  "The prosecution is determined to terminate the illegal use 
of computer softwares," Yun said, adding, the further 
investigation will be made upon request from the 
software-producing companies. 
  Yun indicated that the prosecution's further investigations 
may focus on major companies which the foreign companies claim 
are allegedly using their software without consent. 
  Those who copy foreign computer software illegally will face 
punishment of fines up to 30 million won (35,500 U.S. Dollars).

  [Text] Seoul, June 2 (YONHAP) -- Taiwan relaxed from 
Thursday part of the retaliatory economic steps it had taken 
against South Korea in the wake of the establishment of 
diplomatic ties between Seoul and Beijing, a diplomatic source 
reported. 
  Taiwan took the action following a meeting in Seoul Tuesday 
and Wednesday between non-governmental representatives of the 
two countries, the source said, requesting anonymity. 
  The Taiwanese measure covers South Korean exports of apples 
and pears, he said. 
  The source said the two sides are expected to sign a formal 
agreement Thursday evening. 
  Seoul and Taipei will soon hold negotiations on Korean auto 
exports to Taiwan and the reopening of civil airline services, 
the sources said. 
  In the case of apple exports, Seoul will increase the amount 
slightly from the 3,780 tons it last shipped before the 
severance of diplomatic ties. Pear exports will be about 1,040 
tons or nearly the same level of 1992. 
  As for counterpurchase, the two countries will increase the 
volume slight from the 1992 level of 3,696 tons. Due to 
Taiwan's competitive strength in banana exports, two sides 
agreed to include bananas along with onions and garlic in the 
counterpurchase category.

  [Text] Seoul, June 2 (YONHAP) -- Taiwan has decided to 
resume importing apples and pears from South Korea, which they 
stopped buying in 1992 in a protest over Seoul's cutoff of 
diplomatic ties with Taipei. 
  At a private-level Korea-Taiwan meeting held in Seoul on 
Tuesday and Wednesday, the two sides agreed on a barter trade 
involving fruits and vegetables. 
  Under the agreement, South Korea will export 5,500 tons of 
apples and 2,000 tons of pears to Taiwan in the 1993-`94 period 
while importing from Taiwan 11,000 tons of Taiwanese bananas, 
5,000 tons of onions and 2,800 tons of garlic, all in an amount 
equivalent to the value of the apple and pear exports. 
  Besides, Taiwan promised to import 4,000 tons of South 
Korean 
apples separate from the barter trade. 
  This means that Taiwan will import 11,500 tons of South 
Korean fruits in the current year, which compares with 8,516 
tons they imported in the 1991-92 period immediately before the 
breakup of formal relations.

Zealand have decided to extend their bilateral fishery agreement 
set to expire on Sept. 30 this year for four years until 1998. 
  A Korean fisheries administration official said on Friday 
the 
decision was made at a Korea-New Zealand fishery meeting held in 
Wellington on May 30-31. 
  New Zealand agreed at the meeting to reflect lowered fishery 
fees for South Korean fishing boats operating in the New Zealand 
waters in the New Zealand fishery law now being revised. 
  The oceanic country also promised to cooperate positively in 
the effort of Korea to join the southern tuna protection 
convention and thereby obtain a tuna fishing quota. 
  Moreover, the two countries agreed to step up their 
cooperation through various international working-level fishery 
conferences, the official said. 
  The Wellington meeting was attended by a seven-member Korean 
delegation headed by Pak Ki-chol, a fishery promotion official 
of the fisheries administration.

  [Text] Seoul, June 1 (YONHAP) -- Starting with the 33 
Nepalese workers who arrived in South Korea Tuesday, some 20,000 
foreign trainees will be supplied to small manufacturing 
companies across the country by early August to ease a manpower 
shortage. 
  The foreign workers will undergo a one-year apprenticeship 
and they can prolong their stay by another year if they or their 
employers request an extension. 
  The workers, allowed in by the government to alleviate the 
worsening manpower shortage at small- and medium-sized 
manufacturing firms, hail from 11 countries. Among these 
nations, China is sending the largest number of workers with 
8,000 including ethnic Koreans, followed by 3,000 Filipinos, 
2,400 Vietnamese and 1,600 Bangladeshis. Myanmar [Burma] and 
Sri Lanka will dispatch 1,000 workers apiece while Nepal, 
Indonesia and Pakistan are each sending 800, trailed by Thailand 
and Iran with 300 apiece. 
  The Korea Federation of Small Business (KFSB) has voiced 
concern about possible social problems caused by foreign workers 
deserting their places of employment. The KFSB is in charge of 
overall management of their introduction to domestic enterprises. 
  Previously, the Ministries of Labor and Justice opposed the 
introduction of foreign laborers amid a controversy over the 
issue at the end of last year, citing a possible rise in 
domestic unemployment, worsening labor conditions, an upsurge in 
crime, and the possibility of the workers overstaying. 
  In an effort to ease such worries, the KFSB has made the 
manpower agencies and manufacturers responsible for the workers 
to lessen the chances of any untoward incidents during the 
training period. 
  The manpower companies and manufacturers employing the 
foreign workers must deposit 100 U.S. dollars and 300,000 won, 
respectively, for each foreign trainee to guarantee performance 
of contract. This guarantee money will be collected as a 
penalty if the workers desert their workplaces due to an 
employer's illegal treatment or a supplier's negligence in 
management. 
  At the same time, they are obliged to be insured against 
accidents so that the workers can be compensated for any 
industrial mishaps. 
  However, small- and medium-sized companies insist the 20,000 
workers "officially permitted" are insufficient to solve the 
labor shortage, noting that many other businesses are paying 
high commissions to manpower agencies or brokers in search of 
illegal foreign workers. 
  According to the Justice Ministry, an estimated 70,000 to 
80,000 foreigners are working illegally in Korea. That being 
the case, smaller businesses insist that an additional 30,000 to 
40,000 foreign workers be allowed to come to Korea under strict

    [Editorial Report] The May 17 TONG-A ILBO editorial on 
page 3 expressed concern over the new prime minister's lack of 
authority. On 4 May, Yi Yong-tok, in office for only five days, 
issued a memorandum revising regulations on official vehicle 
usage for government-funded businesses and institutes. The 
memo, which had a 14 May suspense date, requested all concerned 
to prepare an action plan and return it to his office. 
  Although there are 340 such businesses and institutes, not 
even one has carried out his order. Were the plan to be 
implemented, the government could save over 100 billion won 
annually. It appears the Prime Minister's office is trying not 
to make this non-compliance a major issue. The office made the 
excuse that 10 days was not enough for the offices to make their 
reports. The editorial pointed out that saving 100 billion won 
isn't a minor issue, but the real problem is a powerless prime 
minister. Without authority, he cannot have an effective 
working relationship with his cabinet or with the National 
Assembly. Former Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang left office because 
he couldn't establish his authority. 
  The editorial urged President Kim to grant the prime 
minister 
sufficient authority so he can act to reform the government. It 
also reminded the president that the real victims--should Yi 
fail to carry out his job--are the people; not the government, 
not the National Assembly, nor Yi Yong-tok and his office.

  [Text] The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Mrs. 
Ho The Lan, held a regular international news conference in 
Hanoi on 2 June. The conference was attended by a large number 
of correspondents from the foreign and local mass media and by 
the press attaches of a number of foreign embassies in Vietnam. 
  In reply to a question raised by an ITAR-TASS correspondent 
on the schedule and timing for Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's 
visit to the Russian Federation, and another question posed by a 
REUTERS correspondent on what republics the prime minister will 
visit and on the subjects to be discussed during the visit, Mrs. 
Ho The Lan said: 
  At the invitation of the prime ministers of the Russian 
Federation, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
will visit these countries in the near future. 
  These countries used to have age-old traditional relations 
with Vietnam. But following some eventful changes, the 
relations between Vietnam and these countries have not lived up 
to their potential. Now that these countries and Vietnam wish 
to develop their friendly and cooperative relations, a number of 
agreements on cooperation have been signed and various bilateral 
and international issues have also been discussed between 
Vietnam and each of these countries. This will be the first 
visit by the Vietnamese prime minister to these countries. 
  A NIKKEI correspondent asked: According to an ITAR-TASS 
dispatch, Senior General Doan Khue will visit the DPRK on 16 
June. Is this news accurate? 
  The Vietnamese spokesperson said: Senior General Doan Khue, 
Vietnamese defense minister, will visit the DPRK in the near 
future at the invitation of the DPRK defense minister. This 
visit is designed to strengthen the relations between the armed 
forces and peoples of the two countries. 
  The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesperson also made 
public 
a number of important diplomatic activities relating to Vietnam 
and many other countries in the world.

  [Text] Hanoi, June 3 (AFP) - Vietnam has stepped up its 
fishing activities around the disputed Spratly Islands over the 
past 18 months, under the "devoted" protection of the Vietnamese 
coast guard, the army newspaper reported Friday. QUAN DOI NHAN 
DAN said the number of Vietnamese fishing boats had increased 
from 94 to 150 since the beginning of last year. It said 
Vietnamese fishermen had shown "great efficiency" in their 
operations around the Spratlys, a South China Sea chain claimed 
wholly by Vietnam, China and Taiwan and in part by the 
Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. Fishing in the area is now 
the main source of revenue for the residents of Phu Quy island, 
which is outside the Spratly archipelago about 120 kilometres 
(75 miles) off southern Vietnam, according to QUAN DOI NHAN DAN. 
It said coast guard units based on Phu Quy have given local 
fishermen "devoted support" in their trips around the Spratlys. 
In a bid to bolster its claims to the area, the Vietnamese 
government has used tax exemptions to encourage local fishermen 
to operate in the Spratlys. Over the past several months the 
official Vietnamese press -- especially the QUAN DOI NHAN DAN -- 
has run articles on the Spratlys almost daily, in an evident 
attempt to reaffirm Hanoi's sovereignty. Speaking to AFP on 
Friday, the foreign ministry again condemned as "illegal" 
China's awarding of a contract to US-based Crestone Energy Corp. 
for offshore oil drilling in the area. Vietnam previously 
announced the construction of two lighthouses and a fishing port 
on the Spratlys, forerunning infrastructure development on the 
21 islands in the archipelago that are occupied by Vietnamese 
soldiers.

  [Text] Hanoi, June 2 (AFP) -- Vietnamese Defense Minister 
General Doan Khue is to make an official "friendship visit" to 
North Korea in the next few days, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman 
said here Thursday. 
  "This visit is aimed at strengthening the friendly ties 
between the two armies and the two peoples," spokeswoman Ho The 
Lan said at a press briefing. 
  Diplomatic sources here said though Hanoi has been 
approached 
by western countries to intercede in the nuclear crisis on the 
Korean peninsula between Pyongyang, Seoul and Washington. 
  The ministry spokeswoman did not give the dates of the 
visit. 
But according to the Japanese press, the general, who ranks 
fifth in the politburo of the Vietnamese Communist Party, will 
visit Pyongyang from June 16. 
  Khue's visit is the first by a Vietnamese defense minister 
to 
North Korea since the Vietnam War, and official visits to 
Stalinist North Korea have been infrequent over the past few 
years. 
  Bilateral relations were frozen after Vietnam and South 
Korea 
normalized ties in 1992.

  [Text] The Ninth National Assembly's Fifth Session enters 
its seventh work day today, 2 June. In the morning's plenary 
session, the National Assembly continued to discuss the revised 
draft law on the organization of the People's Councils and 
People's Committees under the direction of National Assembly 
Chairman Nong Duc Manh. 
  The National Assembly discussed new issues related to the 
law. Some deputies suggested that the law be called the Bill on 
Amending and Supplementing -- not the Law on Revision of -- Some 
Articles of the Law on Organization of the People's Councils and 
People's Committees. They also suggested that only a few 
articles required amendment. Other deputies urged that the 
National Assembly hold back the law for a while and wait for the 
upcoming party Central Committee Plenum where new measures will 
be set to resolve various pressing issues related to the 
activities of the People's Councils and People's Committees. 
  Many deputies said a vertical-type administrative system 
should not be applied to the management of the People's Council. 
Rather, the National Assembly Standing Committee and the 
government should formulate concrete regulations on coordination 
between echelons of the People's Councils. Other deputies 
supported this idea, but asked who will take up the 
responsibility of approving the composition of the People's 
Council Standing Committee and who will be authorized to 
determine the wage and retirement systems of members of the 
People's Councils and so forth. 
  Some deputies said the chairmen of People's Committees 
should 
also be members of the People's Councils, with the exemptions 
given in specific essential cases. Many deputies suggested that 
it is necessary to set up the People's Council Offices in 
provinces and cities and that many localities have already done 
so. Other deputies suggested that among other specialized teams 
a scientific-technological and environmental team be set up in 
the People's Council, and that the environmental protection task 
be added to the duties of the People's Councils. Many deputies 
suggested that a sanctions system be applied so that the 
People's Councils and the councillors may be able to settle 
letters of complaint and denunciations lodged by the voters. 
Some other deputies have asked whether we should consider the 
removal of councillors at the regular People's Councils meetings 
or to solicit the views of voters on this matter, especially 
when more than 50 percent and not two-thirds of People's Council 
members are decided on the removal of a people's councillor. 
Many deputies suggested that the People's Councils and 
councillors be charged with the additional task of opposing 
corruption and smuggling. 
  The National Assembly will continue its work this afternoon 
at the conference hall.

  [Summary] "Dear friends: The Ninth National Assembly's 
fifth session entered its seventh day today. The National 
Assembly devoted a large part of its time to debating the 
revised draft law on the organization of People's Councils and 
People's Committees. National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh 
directed the morning and afternoon sessions. 
  "All the views expressed at the conference hall were focused 
on improving the effectiveness of the People's Councils, 
people's councillors, and People's Committees, and other local 
organs of power, especially those at the village and ward levels. 
  "Some deputies proposed that this law be called The Law on 
Amendment of and Supplement to a Number of Articles of the Law 
on the Organization of People's Councils and People's Committees 
rather than the Revised Law on the Organization of People's 
Councils and People's Committees." 
  Others suggested that the name of this law not be changed 
because it has been released for public view. 
  "The majority of those who spoke agreed to retain the name 
of 
the revised law." 
  Many deputies who spoke "favored the idea that we should not 
have a top-to-bottom chain of administrative command for 
People's Councils. However, the National Assembly Standing 
Committee and the government should devise specific procedures 
on cooperation between People's Councils at various levels." 
  Some deputies believed that the draft law is still confusing 
when it comes to defining the roles between the People's 
Councils and People's Committees in directing local 
socioeconomic development activities. 
  "The majority of the deputies who spoke agreed with a 
proposal that the term of office of a People's Council be five 
years. As for the provincial, city, district, and precinct 
People's Councils, they should meet twice a year while the 
village and ward People's Councils should meet on a quarterly 
basis." 
  Some deputies raised the question whether the removal of a 
people's councillor should be considered at a People's Council 
meeting or be done based on views of voters, especially when 
such a removal is decided by more than half -- but less than 
two-thirds -- of the number of people's councillors present. 
  There were also differing views on the question of whether a 
People's Committee chairman will necessarily be a people's 
councillor. "The majority of those deputies who spoke favored 
the idea that a People's Committee chairman must be a people's 
councillor." However, some deputies asked that the law must 
further specify that in special cases, a People's Committee 
chairman need not necessarily be a people's councillor. This 
will facilitate the transfer or appointment of a People's 
Committee chairman. 
  "Dear friends: During their afternoon debate at the 
conference hall, some deputies started voicing their views on 
the draft law on the People's Council election. This draft law 
will continue to be debated by the National Assembly at 
tomorrow's morning session at the conference hall."

  [Text] The National Assembly Office has issued Communique 
No. 7 as follows: 
  Today, 2 June, the National Assembly held a plenary session

Chairman Nong Duc Manh. This session was designed to debate the 
two draft laws -- namely the revised draft law on the 
organization of people's councils and people's committees, and 
the revised draft law on the election of the people's council. 
  Prior to the debate, the secretariat of the session handed 
out to National Assembly deputies a report rounding up the views 
exchanged at various group discussions on these two draft laws. 
Twenty-seven deputies spoke on these topics. They were: Mai 
Thuc Lan of Quang Nam-Danang, Nguyen Khac Tao of Ha Tinh, Bui 
Thi Binh of Hoa Binh, Phan Minh Thanh of Tien Giang, Nguyen Duc 
Hoan of Quang Tri, Y Xuoi of Kon Tum, Dang Cong Thach of Long 
An, Le Quang Dao of Hanoi, Bui Huu Hai of Vinh Phu, Phan Thu of 
Ha Tay, Dinh Cong Doan of An Giang, Trang A Pao of Lao Cai, Tran 
Thi Minh Chanh of Phu Yen, Hoang Thua of Ha Giang, Nguyen Thiet 
Hung of Khanh Hoa, Nong Hong Thai of Cao Bang, Bui Quang Tam of 
Kien Giang, Bui Bich Lien of Lam Dong, Dang Van Ly of Tay Ninh, 
Mua Thi My of Lai Chau, Do Binh Duong of Ha Bac, Hoang Thi Bich 
Ly of Lang Son, Nguyen Chi Ben of Ninh Thuan, Dang Thi Thanh 
Huong of Quang Ninh, Nguyen Van Kha of Nam Ha, Le Thanh Binh of 
Soc Trang, and Trinh Xuan Mao of Thanh Hoa. 
  The deputies concentrated their debate on the following 
issues: 
  -- the name of these laws; 
  -- the position, functions, duty, and powers of the 
people's councils; 
  -- the duty and powers of the people's council standing 
committee and of its subordinate sections; 
  -- the dismissal of people's councillors; 
  -- the functions, duty, and powers of people's committees 
and people's committee chairmen; 
  -- procedures designed to coordinate activities between 
the Fatherland Front and its component organizations on one side 
and the people's councils and people's committees on the other; 
  -- qualification standards for people's councillors; and 
  -- the quota of people's councillors at various levels. 
  Tomorrow, 3 June, the National Assembly will work at the 
conference hall.

<F P=106> [Report by Le Anh Dung] </F>
  [Text] The 1993-94 winter-spring rice crop of Quang Tri 
Province has been a serious failure. More than 50 percent of 
20,372 hectares of the crop have been completely damaged due to 
low temperatures (16-18 decree Celsius) caused by a cold spell 
and prolonged bad weather in March this year. The weather was 
especially damaging as the rice were about to grow ears and has 
resulted in total crop failure. 
  According to a preliminary survey, the province has a 
shortfall of 30,000 tonnes of paddy and 20,000 tonnes of 
subsidiary food crops. The province has thus far produced only 
32,000 tonnes of rice or 48.4 percent of the set target. Nearly 
200 agricultural cooperatives have experienced a sharp decline 
in rice production. On the average, they have produced only 15 
quintals per hectare or 48.09 percent of the expected yield. 
With the exemption of Huong Hoa District where there was little 
damage to its 600 hectares, more than 50 percent of the crops 
were damaged in the rice growing districts such as Trieu Phong, 
Hai Lang, and Vinh Linh. As a result, 30 percent of households 
in the delta and 39,000 ethnic minorities in Van Kieu and Tra Oi 
villages, where most of them are under social welfare, are 
facing serious hunger. 
  Quang Tri has not experienced such abnormal weather for the 
past several decades. The drought in 1993 destroyed 
30,000-40,000 tonnes of summer-fall rice, while the 
winter-spring rice this year has been a total failure. This has 
adversely affected production, threatened the livelihood of 
people, and put up severe obstacles to the restoration of 
production. 
  In face of this, the provincial party and people's 
committees 
and the people's council have instructed various sectors and 
echelons to mobilize the people to collect whatever paddy they 
can from the remaining winter-spring ricefields. The people 
have also been instructed to strengthen unity, and be thrifty in 
order to overcome numerous difficulties, while waiting for the 
1994 summer-fall rice crop. As an immediate measure, the 
provincial people's committee has spent one billion dong buying 
rice varieties, and corn and green beans for distribution to 
peasants. The province has also strived to improve water 
conservancy projects, and provided more loans to two seed 
producing stations to increase output for the next winter-spring 
crop. It has also instructed the local agricultural service and 
agencies concerned to coordinate with localities to provide 
sufficient seeds and essential materials for the summer-fall 
crop, and to exploit the capabilities of various districts and 
towns to urgently serve production. The province has also asked 
for 50 tonnes of seeds as a loan from Quang Nam-Da Nang and Nghe 
An provinces. It has also radically changed the summer-fall 
crop pattern to suit its unique conditions, prepared for the 
next winter-spring crop, and determined the number of households 
facing serious hunger for prompt assistance.

  [Text] Hanoi, June 1 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Household use of 
opium as a pain-killer has turned children in some parts of 
Vietnam into hardcore addicts by the time they are adolescents, 
according to a workshop report. 
  Highland families in particular not only use opium for 
barter 
but also as a palliative for all ailments causing addiction at a 
very young age, says the report made available to BERNAMA 
Wednesday. 
  It was the first workshop organised here last week to equip 
Vietnam's communist party key cadres nation-wide with 
communication skills to create public awareness of the country's 
drug problem. 
  The report says that although Vietnam is making progress in 
reducing domestic poppy cultivation, such efforts are frustrated 
by increased smuggling of opium from neighbouring countries. 
  It says the area under poppy cultivation had been reduced to 
3,000 hectares last year from 19,000 hectares in 1985 and opium 
production to 10.5 tonnes from 53.9 tonnes during the same 
period. 
  Now 87 percent or 2,630 hectares of the remaining area under 
poppy is in Ky Son in Nghe An Province bordering Laos. 
  A good number of students in that province had been opium 
addicts since their younger days, the report adds. 
  It also shows that there is still no other lucrative cash 
crop better suited to the area's climate, terrain and soil than 
poppy, it says. (poppy plants produce the base to make heroin). 
  Dumping of psychotropic drugs, high relapse rate (80 
percent) 
among treated addicts and lack of funding for sustained 
campaigns are among the other problems Vietnam is facing in 
fighting drug abuse, it says.

  [Text] The Vietnam Consumers Association has conducted a 
poll with 200 households in Hanoi and 400 households in Ho Chi 
Minh City on the prospects of goods consumption and on the types 
of products that buyers like most. The results indicate that 
homemade goods now account for half of the volume of sales on 
the local market, imported goods for 12 percent, and American 
goods for 10 percent. A breakdown of each type of consumer good 
indicates that Japanese-made motorcycles and cars account for 94 
percent. Small-sized Japanese-made machinery and equipment also 
account for as much as 60 percent. The consumption ratio of 
Vietnamese-made foodstuffs is 72 percent and Japanese-made 
foodstuffs 8 percent. The consumption ratio of Vietnamese-made 
beer and cigarettes accounts for 79 percent. As for 
Chinese-made fabrics, children's toys, and generators, they 
account for nearly 90 percent of the volume of sales on the 
local market.

  [Text] [Timor resistance representative] Ramos Horta 
revealed that last night the Timorese resistance carried out a 
strong military offensive on the capital, Dili. This is the 
first resistance attack for many years. The only targets of the 
attack were Indonesian military installations, according to 
Ramos Horta. 
  [Begin Horta recording] There was a very well planned, 
organized, resistance attack on a number of military units in 
the outskirts of Dili. It led to strong retaliation from the 
Indonesians. The shooting went on for several hours. A Chinese 
was killed with a bayonet by the Indonesian forces -- he was 
stabbed in the head with it. 
  We are trying to find out more details of the guerrilla's 
operation, but there is not doubt that it was a major offensive. 
[end recording] 
  Ramos Horta also revealed that the Timorese resistance is 
forming a shadow cabinet to take over the future of East Timor 
at a moment's notice.

<F P=106> [From the "Rosebud" column by Joe Alejandrino: "A Tale of </F>
Two Ramoses"] 
  [Text] Two years ago, several men met at a restaurant in 
Lisbon to discuss the holding of an international conference on 
East Timor, one of them was Jose Ramos-Horta. Unknown to these 
men was a blue-and-white delivery van parked across the street 
from the restaurant with a long-range listening device that 
recorded their conversation. Inside the van were agents of the 
Indonesian Secret Service who were tailing Ramos-Horta, a 
well-known leader of the resistance movement of East Timor. 
  The plan was to hold the conference somewhere in Asia in 
November 1993 to coincide with the anniversary of the 1991 Dill 
massacre. It would be held under the guise of discussing human 
rights, but its real objective was political: to turn East 
Timor into a major international issue to force the Suharto 
government to grant self-determination to East Timor and push 
the Indonesian people to overthrow military rule in favor of a 
democratic government. At the end of the conference, a 
declaration would be issued condemning the Indonesian Government 
for the violation of human rights in East Timor and urging all 
nations to follow suit and impose sanctions. 
  The conference in November had to be postponed, probably 
because of funding difficulties but most likely because the 
organizers could not find an appropriate venue to hold it in 
Asia. The National Democratic Front which maintained contact 
with dissident movements worldwide and which was unhappy about 
the peace and amnesty proposals of the Ramos government that had 
driven a sharp wedge through their ranks, suddenly had a clever 
idea. Why not hold it in Manila? The Philippine Government 
would then be faced with the unpleasant prospect of stopping the 
conference and violating the constitutional provisions on free 
speech and free assembly or damaging its close ties with Jakarta 
and breaking up ASEAN. Either way, it would be a no-win 
situation for Fidel V. Ramos. 
  In their meetings with Ramos-Horta in Bangkok and Sydney, 
Renato Constantino Jr. and Cecilia Jimenez, both known for their 
leftist sympathies, broached the idea of holding it within the 
premises of the University of the Philippines (UP). If the 
Ramos government objected, the UP faculty and students would 
rise to defend their academic freedom and autonomy. The 
conference was scheduled for May-June 1994. To add an aura of 
prestige to the conference, it was decided to invite 
international personalities like Danielle Mitterand, the wife of 
the French President who was a human rights advocate. This way, 
if Fidel V. Ramos tried to stop the conference it would prove an 
embarrassment to the Philippine Government. 
  The Indonesians, who were closely monitoring the situation, 
were feeding intelligence reports on a regular basis to Gen. Joe 
Almonte, the national security adviser. Thus the question of 
the conference was taken up by Cluster E that deals with 
security matters. Cluster E concluded there was really nothing 
the Philippine Government could do short of violating the 
Philippine Constitution. 
  Jakarta was unhappy. It could not understand why a 
conference with clear political overtones aimed at subverting 
Indonesian territorial integrity was being allowed by Manila in 
a state-subsidized university. Had not Indonesia been a good 
and loyal friend? When the Philippines suffered an oil crunch, 
it was Indonesian oil that bailed it out. When it was struck by 
a natural calamity, Indonesian help was the first on its way. 
When the Muslims wanted to secede from the Philippines, 
Indonesia acted as a moderating influence in international fora. 
In fact, both countries were not only the closest of allies, 
they were bound as brothers by race and were together in ASEAN. 
Hence Jakarta viewed Manila's lack of firm action as a stab in 
the back. What it did not know is that Fidel V. Ramos was 
looking quietly and patiently for a legal solution to the crisis. 
  To show its displeasure, Jakarta postponed the round of 
talks 
with the MNLF [Moro National Liberation Front] that was being 
held in the Indonesian capital as well as its investments and 
participation in the East ASEAN Growth Area business conference 
in Davao. Manila sent a three-man diplomatic mission led by 
former foreign secretary Raul Manglapus to Jakarta to explain 
the Philippine position and to reaffirm its full support for the 
territorial integrity of Indonesia. The Ramos government, 
Manglapus assured the Indonesian foreign minister, would explore 
all legal avenues to contain the damage that would be caused by 
the East Timor conference. But Jakarta was not appeased. 
  The furor created by the conference was not lost on the 
French whose embassy in Manila kept Paris updated. If General 
Suharto was prepared to break with General Ramos over East 
Timor, there was no reason why he would not do the same with 
Francois Mitterand if Danielle attended the conference. And the 
French could not afford such a break given the fragile political 
situation in France and its investments in Indonesia. France 
was a major supplier of arms to Indonesia and the French 
armament industry was in the doldrums due to the end of the Cold 
War. It would be in the French national interest that Danielle 
stayed out of the conference. 
  Jakarta stepped up its pressure. It forbade Indonesian 
students to participate in any meeting in Manila and its 
gunboats arrested Filipino fishermen in Indonesian waters. It 
hinted that Filipinos working in Indonesia would lose their jobs 
and be repatriated back to Manila. Indonesian NGO's 
[nongovernment organizations] threatened to convene a conference 
that would affect Philippine territorial integrity. The subtle 
message conveyed by Jakarta was that any persons or countries 
that would harm Indonesia would be responsible for the harm to 
their own people. While aimed specifically at the Philippines, 
the message was really addressed to all nations alike. 
  No right-thinking government could ignore such a message. 
The acts of a few would not be allowed to affect the interests 
of a whole nation, particularly if they are foreigners acting to 
manipulate a situation that serves only their personal ends. 
This was the rationale behind President Ramos' decision to ban 
foreign participants to the East Timor conference in Manila and 
the government had a perfect right to do so. Filipinos could 
discuss what they want at that conference since they are 
protected by their constitutional rights, but no foreigners have 
the right to damage the good relations between countries of 
which they are not citizens. 
  It is understandable that Indonesia reacted the way it did. 
Any country with a sense of dignity and sovereignty would have 
done the same. When Harvey Firestone tried to separate Mindanao 
from the rest of the Philippines in the early 1900's to benefit 
the American rubber industry, Manuel L. Quezon threatened to 
lead a revolt against the United States. The bill sponsored by 
Representative Bacon of New York died a quiet death in the House 
Committee on Insular Affairs. 
  President Ramos' decision to ban foreign participants was 
clearly in the national interest. Countries that are poor 
cannot afford to eat on principles by being the world policemen 
of human rights. Nor can one affect change by isolating 
Indonesia, as Jose Ramos-Horta proposes to do. Had Fidel V. 
Ramos not done what he did, the damage to the Philippines would 
have been incalculable. History would surely have branded him 
as a traitor for the hardships brought upon his people. 
Something that the local convenors of the East Timor conference 
would do well to reflect on.

  [Text] Malacanang [presidential office] disclosed the 
economic repercussions of an impairment in Philippine-Indonesian 
relations as a result of the staging at the University of the 
Philippines of the Asia-Pacific Conference on East Timor. 
  Presidential Assistant for Mindanao Paul Dominguez said that 
the joint fishing operations and other collaborative activities 
between the two countries could be adversely affected as a 
result of any impairment in bilateral relations. Dominguez said 
the negative consequences include drastic decline in the volume 
of fish landings; reduction in the output of five canneries; 
decrease on the level of fish imports; (?retrenchment); 
increase on the price of fish; increase in the cost of 
livestock due to increase in the price of fishmeal; collapse in 
the Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippine East ASEAN Growth 
Area with incalculable damage to the projected development of 
Mindanao in the context of a bigger sub-regional market. 
  Loss of excess to 5 billion dollars of investible funds in 
east ASEAN, loss of access to 40 million consumer, and joint 
venture projects with Indonesian business groups upsetting 
investments of about 1 billion pesos [Philippine pesos] are in 
trouble. Dominguez said that 65 percent of the gross product of 
General Santos City is related to fishing. The deep sea fishing 
industry in the city has a total investment of 2 billion pesos 
in a combined fishing fleet of 300 fish carriers, 120 fish 
catchers, five canneries and a network of cold storage 
facilities employing 36,000 people and 200,000 dependents. The 
deep sea fish industry of the city has joint fishing operations 
with the Indonesian counterpart. The industry generates 200 
million dollars from export revenues annually.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan has asked the 
Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) and the Bank of 
Thailand to set the scope of the proposed money laundering law 
in a way that will not affect the country's financial system, 
according to government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa. 
  Amnuay told the council of economic ministers on Monday the 
two agencies had also been instructed to consider whether the 
proposed legislation should target drug traffickers alone or 
include other criminal groups as well, Aphisit said. 
  Members of other crime syndicates, such as those involved in 
prostitution and the smuggling of contraband and war weapons, 
are also known to launder their profits through legitimate banks 
and financial institutions using the same methods as drug 
traffickers. 
  Government leaders have said they agree with the proposal by 
anti-narcotics officials to introduce a money laundering law, 
provided that such a move does not infringe on individual 
freedoms. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said he approved of the idea in 
principle because a money laundering law would prevent dishonest 
people converting their ill-gotten wealth into legal currencies. 
  Anti-drug officials say that without such a law, drug 
traffickers will continue to flourish through their illegal 
trade. 
  ONCB staff say many major traders in illicit drugs are 
beyond 
the reach of the law because law enforcement officials do not 
have hard evidence to link them to the crime.

<F P=106> [by Nam Son-yong from UN Headquarters] </F>
  [Text] Hans Blix, director general of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], today reported officially to UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali that it has become 
impossible for the IAEA to make a follow-up measurement [chuhu 
kyechuk] of nuclear fuel rods at a reactor in Yongbon, North 
Korea. 
  In his written report, Director General Blix said: Based on 
the IAEA inspection team's report on the replacement of nuclear 
fuel rods at a North Korean 5-megawatt reactor, the IAEA came to 
the conclusion that the selection [sonbyol] of fuel rods to 
determine whether North Korea has diverted nuclear fuel or not 
has become impossible. 
  Serving as a final confirmation on the failure of the IAEA 
inspection on the nuclear fuel rods in North Korea, his report 
provides grounds for the UN Security Council to apply sanctions 
against North Korea. 
  Accordingly, following a verbal report by Director General 
Blix this afternoon [3 June], the UN Security Council will 
likely have full-fledged discussions on methods of sanctions 
against North Korea. 
  A UN diplomatic source says the United States, ROK, and 
Japan 
have begun to discuss a resolution on sanctions, and 
France,which holds a hard-line position, has also separately 
drafted a resolution. 
  According to this source, in light of the present 
atmosphere, 
it is highly possible that the UN Security Council will directly 
apply economic sanctions without taking steps for warning. If 
China continues opposition to sanctions, measures to prohibit 
remittances from Japan and North Korean missile exports to the 
Middle East will likely be taken, while permitting China to 
continue supplying oil and food to North Korea.

  [Text] The South Korea-U.S. joint "Ulchi-Focus Lens" 
military exercise will be conducted in August for about two 
weeks, the Defense Ministry announced yesterday. 
  Ulchi-Focus Lens is a command post exercise, which started 
in 
1976 combining the Ulchi exercise conducted by the Korean 
government and Focus Lens, a military exercise which had been 
conducted under the U.N. Command. 
  It was separated into two and held on a smaller scale in 
1991-1993 to help provide a favorable mood for the inter-Korea 
talks. 
  This year the two exercises will be combined again into 
Ulchi-Focus, because Team Spirit, the annual large-scale 
Korea-U.S. joint field exercise which is usually held in early 
spring, has been postponed to November this year over North 
Korea's nuclear impasse, a Defense Ministry official said. 
  But the official refused to say how many Korean and U.S. 
troops will participate in the drill.

  [Text] Hanoi, June 3 KYODO -- Vietnamese Communist Party 
chief Do Muoi says Hanoi wants to have fully normalized ties 
with the United States as early as possible but without any 
linkage to human rights. 
  "As for when our relations with the United States can be 
normalized, that is up to the American side," Muoi said in an 
interview Thursday [2 June] night with KYODO NEWS SERVICE 
President Yasuhiko Inukai. "The sooner the better." 
  Muoi, 77, noted that a U.S. Government delegation is 
expected 
to visit Hanoi shortly, though he did not suggest the level at 
which it would be led. 
  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord reportedly 
plans a visit around the end of this month, which may be 
followed in late July by a visit by U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher. 
  Muoi said that while Vietnam stands prepared to discuss 
human 
rights and various other issues with the U.S., it cannot accept 
any linkage between human rights issues and overall bilateral 
relations. 
  His remarks follow President Bill Clinton's decision to 
extend China's most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status despite 
domestic pressures to use trade as a leverage to force human 
rights concessions. 
  Vietnam, which is reorienting its economy toward exports, is 
reportedly one of only nine countries not accorded the 
low-tariff status by Washington. 
  On Feb. 3, Clinton lifted the 19-year-old U.S. embargo 
against Vietnam. 
  Last month, Vietnamese and U.S. diplomats exchanged 
diplomatic notes on the opening of liaison offices in each 
other's capitals as a step toward full diplomatic ties. 
  Turning to Vietnam's simmering row with China over 
potentially oil-rich areas of the South China Sea, Muoi called 
on Beijing to spell out more clearly its proposal for shelving 
the disputes and participating in joint development. 
  He said that though the idea of joint development may merit 
consideration, the issue of sovereignty must be resolved first. 
  Muoi called for a conference among all parties laying claim 
to the contested areas of the South China Sea, which include 
Vietnam, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei. 
  He said Vietnam prefers that the matter be settled through 
peaceful dialogue. 
  Beijing and Hanoi are disputing ownership of the Spratly and 
Paracel Islands and their adjacent areas, having skirmished at 
sea over the sovereignty issue as recently as 1988. 
  Each country's awarding of oil exploration concessions to 
foreign companies has raised the level of tension in recent 
months. 
  Muoi suggested that China is violating Vietnamese 
sovereignty 
by drilling in an area which he said is "clearly part of 
Vietnam's Continental Shelf." 
  Earlier this week, a U.S. energy company contracted by 
Beijing began a physical seismic survey in an area only 350 
kilometers southeast of Ho Chi Minh City. 
  Muoi also made a case for increasing in Japanese investment 
in Vietnam, noting that investors could produce at low cost by 
taking advantage of Vietnam's cheap labor. 
  He lamented that the level of Japanese direct investment 
remains relatively small and noted that more of it goes to China 
than to Vietnam. 
  With some 496 million dollars so far invested in 53 
projects, 
Japan trails in sixth place behind Taiwan, Hong Kong, South 
Korea, Australia and Singapore as an investor in Vietnam. 
  Muoi said Vietnam holds high expectations of Japan as a 
source of capital and technology needed to develop the country's 
increasingly market-oriented economy. 
  He said he looks forward to an opportunity to visit Japan. 
  Muoi was named party general secretary in June 1991 after 
having served as prime minister for three years. 
  The son of a farming family outside Hanoi, he became a party 
member in 1939 at age 22. 
  He was jailed in the early 1940s by the French for 
participating in the movement against colonial rule. 
  Elected a member of the party's decision-making Central 
Committee in 1960, he was appointed vice premier in 1969 and 
became a full member of the ruling Politburo in 1982. 
  In July 1988, while serving as vice chairman of the Council 
of Ministers in charge of capital construction, industry and 
material supply, he was elected by the National Assembly to 
succeed the late Prime Minister Pham Hung.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 3 June Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] Japan and the United States ended two days of 
negotiations on the insurance sector at the economic framework 
talks on 2 June. While the two governments have refused to 
disclose details of the discussions, they seem to have failed to 
reach agreement on what should be used as objective criteria to 
gauge the openness of the market in the insurance sector, and 
special consideration for foreign insurance companies in 
relation to deregulation measures on the "third sector" 
insurance covering injury, nursing services, and so forth. The 
two countries will resume negotiations in Tokyo before the end 
of June, and are expected to start working on the wording of the 
agreement in the next round of talks. However, a final 
agreement may still take some time. 
  According to the Ministry of Finance, discussions in the 
past 
two days confirmed points of agreement reached as of last 
February, and the Japanese negotiating team explained the main 
points of the ongoing process of amending the Insurance Business 
Act to pave the way for insurance system reform. 
  Regarding objective criteria and problems related to the 
third sector insurance, both sides limited themselves to an 
affirmation of their basic positions. "Concrete issues were not 
discussed," (according to a senior Finance Ministry official). 
The United States did not present any new demands during the 
discussions either. 
  The U.S. side also agrees that "there is still a lot of work 
to do before an agreement can be reached," (according to a 
Department of Commerce official). There is a possibility that 
the negotiations may experience rough sailing on the issue of 
objective criteria.

<F P=106> [By economic reporter Hiroshi Yamazaki] </F>
  [Text] The Ministry of Finance [MOF] is expected to face a 
new and difficult issue in connection with the Japan-U.S. trade 
talks, the parties to which have agreed to resume negotiations. 
The issue consists of the U.S. Government's request to add 
financial services to the priority sectors, which means that 
other facets of the financial sector will potentially become 
targets of negotiations following the imminent agreement on the 
insurance sector. The setting of numerical goals has been 
avoided, but the agreement to resume the talks included 
provision for measurement of "market participation and sales 
expansion" for each sector, which would indicate difficult 
negotiations for the MOF. 
  The trade talks targeted financial services from the very 
beginning, but the recent request was a move to make financial 
services a priority negotiating goal on a par with insurance, 
automobiles, and government procurement. According to the MOF, 
in past negotiations, the U.S. Government sought 1) relaxation 
of controls on management of public annuity funds, 2) 
modification of the rule that managing underwriting services are 
limited to four major securities firms, and 3) clarification of 
government controls over financial services. 
  The primary focus will be directed at restrictions on the 
management of public annuity funds. The Pension Welfare Service 
Public Corporation has contracted with life insurance companies 
and trust and banking companies to manage a portion of the 
welfare annuity and national annuity funds, but the U.S. 
Government has asked that the management of such funds be 
extended to investment consulting firms. The Ministry of Health 
and Welfare had once filed the same request with the MOF, but 
the MOF which issues loans for the management of the funds 
rejected the request, saying such action would expose the funds 
to mismanagement, indicating that negotiations with the U.S. 
Government will inevitably encounter difficulty. 
  The MOF comments, "We have merely heard of the U.S. 
request," 
about the demand for priority negotiations, but confidentially 
they are concerned. Since early in the negotiations, the U.S. 
representatives have said that numerical goals were not sought 
for the insurance sector and, according to sources at the 
International Finance Bureau, if talks are resumed, "We can be 
assured of an agreement" by July. He takes that position 
because, just as it appeared that the pending issues would be 
resolved, the financial services issue which was expected to be 
presented somewhat later was suddenly tabled. 
  However, the U.S. Government had sought decontrol of 
Japanese 
financial markets until the final stages of the Uruguay Round 
negotiations, and U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. 
Summers gave a speech in March 1994, indicating the intention to 
make financial services a point of emphasis in trade talks with 
Japan. Moreover, legislation is pending in Congress to virtually 
target Japan for retaliation in the financial services sector. 
Considering the atmosphere in the United States, it could be 
seen that it was only a matter of time before additional facets 
of the financial sector would be made targets of the trade talks. 
  The concern of the Japanese Government was reflected in the 
items concurred with in the agreement to resume the trade talks. 
Both governments agreed that "market participation and sales 
increases for competitive foreign products" would be sought for 
each principal sector. The U.S. Government declared that it 
would not seek numerical goals, but this agreement can be 
interpreted to indicate that Japan promised "to ensure a 
definite increase in foreign product sales." 
  In the financial services sector, the U.S. Government seeks 
dismantling of virtual monopoly by four major securities firms, 
and there is the risk that the failure of U.S. firms to increase 
their underwriting share could be treated as a violation of the 
agreement. The U.S. side is expected to demand decontrol of the 
markets in lieu of numerical goals, and the MOF, which had 
agreed to this particular approach in order to win resumption of 
the trade talks, may find itself obligated to follow such an 
approach.

  [Text] On 31 May, the Industrial Structure Council [ISC], 
an advisory organ to the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI], announced a "1994 Report on Unfair Trade 
Practices," in which the council scrutinized the unfair trade 
policies and measures of Japan's major trading partners and 
regions, including the United States. The report takes up for 
the first time the cases of Taiwan and China, which is applying 
for GATT membership, enumerating such high tariffs and other 
"points whose correction is desired" in order for China to 
realize its bid for membership in the near future. Regarding the 
United States, the report strongly criticizes such unilateral 
measures as the Super 301 section of the Omnibus Trade Law (for 
designating and applying sanctions against nations conducting 
unfair trade and acts). It seems likely that other countries 
will oppose such criticisms, saying that Japan first needs to 
reduce its trade surplus. They may also question Japan's stance 
to tackle such tasks as expanding imports. 
  The report was put together by the ISC World Trade 
Organization (WTO) Committee's investigation subcommittee for 
unfair trade policies and measures (chaired by Seikei 
University Law School Professor Mitsuo Matsushita). The report 
can be said to be a Japanese version of the "report on foreign 
trade barriers" that the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative 
(USTR) announced in late March. 
  The report classifies unfair policies and measures, -- 
including import volume restrictions, antidumping measures, and 
subsidies, which are obstacles to free trade -- into 13 areas. 
By using the rules of GATT and the World Trade Organization 
(WTO) as a yardstick, the report determines whether policies and 
measures of each trade partner are fair. 
  The report includes comments on the ten major countries and 
regions that are Japan's major trading partners, including the 
United States, the European Union (EU), the ROK, Hong Kong, and 
Australia. In addition, Taiwan and China, which is applying for 
GATT membership, are also included in the report. Of the 12 
nations and regions, 8 nations and regions are in Asia. Japan's 
trade surplus with the Asian nations in fiscal 1993 exceeded for 
the first time that with the United States. Reflecting changes 
in Japan's trade structure, the report attaches importance to 
Asia. However, since it points out Asian nations' problem 
points, it is certain that Japan, which has a huge trade 
surplus, will be urged to make further efforts to open up its 
market. 
  China, (treating the EU as a single region), is Japan's 
third 
largest national trading partner. In fiscal 1992, Japanese 
investment in China doubled over the previous year's level. 
Although China is deepening its economic ties with Japan, the 
report clearly spells out China's various trade restriction 
measures as obstacles hindering the activities of Japanese 
corporations. 
  Specifically, the report urges China to unify its trade 
systems, which vary by region and even by organization. China 
is also asked to revise its double price system whereby 
foreigners and Chinese are charged different fees for the same 
services and to improve its high tariff rates (35 percent on 
average) and import and export volume restrictions. 
  Following China, Taiwan is Japan's fourth largest trading 
partner. The report points out that Taiwan has high tariffs on 
trucks (42.5 percent) and passenger vehicles (30 percent), and 
quantitative restrictions. In particular, Taiwan prohibits 
imports of passenger vehicles, motorcycles, fruits, alcoholic 
beverages, and cigarettes from Japan. Therefore, the report 
urges Taiwan to revise the import bans as quickly as possible. 
  Moreover, the report names the United States in 10 out of 13 
categories of unfair trade practices. It also says that the EU 
and the ROK have problems in four and five fields respectively. 
Regarding U.S. trade policies, particularly those for setting 
numerical targets, the report strongly criticizes the United 
States: "They can be said to violate the WTO accord and 
constitute `managed trade.'"

  [Text] Having been informed on 1 June that the DPRK (North 
Korea) could have layed sea mines off the east coast of that 
country, the Defense Agency [DA] is trying to verify the 
information and has begun collecting related details. 
  Information on the laying of sea mines was reported by the 
U.S. ABC television network. According to DA officials 
concerned, when a U.S. reconnaissance satellite witnessed North 
Korea conducting launch tests for its "Silkworm" anti-ship 
missile on 31 May, the satellite witnessed the presence of what 
looked like mine-laying vessels within North Korea's territorial 
waters off its east coast. The satellite also witnessed the 
frequent flight of airplanes around the vessels. Consequently, 
the possibility that sea mines have been laid was pointed out. 
  The DA said: "We cannot verify the information on the laying 
of sea mines on our own. But, if it turns out to be true, then 
we have no choice but to be gravely concerned." The agency is 
thought to have obtained copies of satellite pictures of the 
scene from U.S. military authorities and to be analyzing them at 
present. The agency is also believed to be hurrying with 
analysis of communications information collected from radar 
sites.

  [Text] Officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
[MOFA], the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], 
and other relevant government ministries and agencies are 
wracking their brains over the likelihood of Japanese ministers 
being absent at the OECD ministerial meeting to be held in Paris 
7-8 June. It will be the first time since 1967 that not a 
single minister will be present at the meeting. As the 50th 
anniversary commemoration of the D-Day, which led to eventual 
allied victory in World War II, is scheduled around the same 
time, European and U.S. leaders will be gathering in France. 
Although Japan has been an OECD member for 30 years this year, 
it may end up with receiving cold treatment by other nations. 
  Japan joined the OECD in 1964. It has sent either a foreign 
minister, trade minister, or economics minister to the annual 
OECD ministerial meetings from 1968. From 1984, all three 
ministers from the MOFA, MITI, and the Economic Planning Agency 
have, as a rule, participated in the annual ministerial meetings. 
  "Employment and Growth" is the major topic in the agenda of 
the upcoming ministerial meeting. U.S. cabinet-level economics 
officials, including Mickey Kantor, U.S. trade representative, 
Lloyd Bentsen, secretary of treasury, Robert Reich, secretary of 
labor, and Laura Tyson, chairman of the Council of Economic 
Advisers, will all gather at the meeting. U.S. President Bill 
Clinton is also scheduled to be in France around the same time. 
It is expected that a series of meetings will be held, taking 
advantage of the OECD forum.

  [Text] In the routine Japan-U.S. talks on plant quarantine 
held in Tokyo, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and 
Fisheries [MAFF] has studied quarantine measures to lift the 
existing ban on imports of U.S.-produced apples, and has 
concluded that there should be no danger of blight worms coming 
in with the imported apples. 
  In the recent talks, the ministry has become convinced that 
there is no problem with the United States' insecticidal and 
disinfecting technologies, as well as with its inspection 
methods. A similar judgment has been passed by the United 
States on the Japan-produced apples. Accordingly, it has become 
certain that the ban on trade regarding apples between the two 
countries will be lifted. The MAFF intends to hold public 
hearings during the coming summer and to decide on formal 
lifting of the ban by autumn.

  [Text] Price differences between products and services at 
home and those abroad, the so-called domestic-foreign price 
differences, have been brought to the fore as a serious problem. 
Why cheap foreign products are expensive in Japan has been 
questioned so far from the consumers' point of view. Now the 
question is being raised by others. Industrial circles have 
also begun to take a serious view of domestic-foreign price 
differences. The reason is that a progressively stronger yen 
has given rise to price differences even for parts and raw 
materials, possibly leading to decreased international 
competitiveness and the hollowing out of industry 
  If the matter is left as is, the future of the Japanese 
economy will be undermined. Forming such a judgment, the 
government has at last begun to tackle the problem in earnest. 
On the instructions of Prime Minister Hata, the Price Stability 
Policy Council [an advisory panel to the prime minister] will 
immediately organize measures to correct domestic-foreign price 
differences beginning around mid-June. 
  On account of domestic-foreign price differences, how 
expensive are the products that Japanese consumers have to buy? 
According to a survey conducted by the Economic Planning Agency 
(EPA) in 1992, the price level for Tokyo was 1.31 times higher 
than that of New York and l.12 times and 1.l4 times higher than 
that of London and Paris, respectively. Tokyo is one of the 
cities in the world with the highest prices. 
  Due to the yen's rapid appreciation from 1993 to 1994, EPA 
sees "a strong possibility of further widening in the 
difference" between the price level in Tokyo and New York. 
Although there have been growing opportunities for buying 
cheap, good imported items due to the spread of volume sales 
stores and other establishments, the flow back to consumers of 
the profits from the strong yen has been only partial. The 
situation whereby consumers are truly able to feel the yen's 
strength by travelling overseas appears likely to continue. 
  A glance at the situation in domestic-foreign price 
differences for major products shows clearly how expensive those 
products are in Japan. According to a survey conducted by Daiwa 
Soken [as published] in 1993, beer in Japan costs 2.5 times as 
much as in the United States at the rate of 107 yen to the 
dollar; 3.1 times higher in Japan for gasoline; 2.7 times higher 
for electric power; 1.5 times higher for domestic air fares; 1.6 
times higher for raw materials that directly bear on the 
competitiveness of the manufacturing industry, such as steel and 
cement. Of the 23 items surveyed, only pharmaceuticals for 
physicians were cheaper in Japan than in the United States. 
  Why has the problem of domestic-foreign price differences 
become serious? The trigger has been the strong yen. 
Subsequently, import-hindering business practices and other 
invisible barriers as well as the high-cost structure of 
domestic industries are seen as the "main culprits." 
  According to common sense, the following process should 
accompany the yen's appreciation: lower prices for imported 
goods -- an increase in imported goods -- intensified 
competition in domestic markets -- reduced costs and increased 
productivity for domestic corporations -- a general fall in 
prices -- and a decrease in the domestic-foreign price 
differences. In Japan, however, prices for the main industrial 
products have remained almost on the same level since the yen's 
appreciation in 1985. Although prices for imported goods have 
declined more than 30 percent since then, import ratios have, 
with the exception of some goods such as textiles, risen little. 
  Ryuji Musha, head of the second corporate research bureau at 
Daiwa Soken, points out that, "In addition to corporations and 
consumers having valued product quality, complicated business 
practices as well as the existence of various types of 
regulations and standards have prevented the penetration of 
imported goods." 
  In such fields unrelated to trade as utilities charges, 
distribution, construction and services, domestic-foreign price 
differences have widened as prices have not fallen. High costs 
in these non-trade areas have pushed up production costs in 
manufacturing industries, which are exposed to keen competition 
with foreign countries, weakening the international 
competitiveness of those industries. A senior executive at a 
major textile manufacturer reveals that, "Even if we rationalize 
and curtail personnel expenses, we cannot compete with imported 
goods from Asia so long as the electricity rate is comparatively 
high." 
  Hitotsubashi University Professor Iwao Nakatani offers 
thorough deregulation and revision of current business practices 
as a prescription for domestic-foreign price differences. The 
idea is to make the price mechanism penetrate further into 
domestic markets. For this to happen, Professor Nakatani 
emphasizes "numerical targets" as a government policy "to halve 
domestic-foreign price differences within the next several 
years." 
  Improving the high-cost structure related to public 
utilities 
charges and other areas could reduce the incomes of people 
working in those fields and increase unemployment. The 
development of industries able to absorb such surplus labor is 
likely to be an issue that must be promoted in parallel with the 
correction of domestic-foreign price differences.

Financial Authorities"] 
<H5>  [5 Jan 94 p 2] </H5>
  [Text] BOJ Policy Planning Bureau/Planning 
Division--Creating Market for Nonperforming Loans, Creating New 
Directions for Debate 
  In recognizing the importance of stabilizing the financial 
system, even as part of Japan's economic recovery plan, the 
public has wanted to know more about those at the helm. 
Financial authorities like the Ministry of Finance [MOF] and the 
Bank of Japan [BOJ], both of which have a role in formulating 
and implementing government policy and supervising Japan's 
financial institutions, have thus become the subject of growing 
interest. This series presents a honest profile of those 
agencies, introducing readers to their personnel, organization, 
and policy-making structures. 
  When the decision was made on 21 September 1993 to lower the 
official discount rate, the seventh in the Bank of Japan's 
history, BOJ's released statement referred to what it called "an 
unprecedented low interest rate" ("somewhat an exaggeration," 
according to Governor Yasushi Mieno of the central bank) and 
became the subject of much discussion within financial circles. 
The announcement was drafted in the Planning Division of the 
central bank's Policy Planning Bureau. 
  Manipulations of the official discount rate stir up a great 
deal of interest not only at home but in other countries. As 
recently shown, when people reacted to the central bank's action 
as a "lowering of interest to save the banks," the public often 
refuses to take BOJ's explanations literally, and generations of 
planning division heads have had to put a great deal of thoughts 
and labor into drafting such announcements. 
  The Planning Division is where the basic direction for the 
bank's monetary policy is formulated and is considered BOJ's 
"brain center." The division formulates important policy on 
matters such as the official discount rate on the basis of 
information gathered from each bureau and branch office. Because 
of its importance in policy formulation, the division is 
considered a "gateway to success" within the bank for those who 
become division chiefs. Of those currently in the leadership 
ranks of the organization, many have at one time or another 
headed the Planning Division, including Governor Mieno (Class of 
1947 [year in which he entered BOJ]) and central bank director 
Toshihiko Fukui (1958). Masaaki Shirakawa (1972), who currently 
heads the division, was chief of the Credit Systems Division for 
three years and was appointed to his present post May 1993 after 
handling a number of difficult cases, including [the dissolution 
of] Toyo Credit Bank. 
  In addition to monetary policy, another important area of 
concern for the Planning Division are measures to stabilize the 
financial system. It is studying the problem along with the 
Credit Systems Bureau and Operations Bureau. 
  At a lecture given at the end of 1993, Governor Mieno 
touched 
on the need to free up the flow of credit, citing the example of 
the United States. He was thus planting the seeds for what has 
become a lively debate on the merits of establishing a market to 
buy and sell nonperforming loans. In other words, an idea 
planted by the central bank has started people to think in a new 
direction. This too is the work of the Planning Division. Its 
job is to put together the ideas that are officially presented 
later by the central bank governor at press conferences, or at 
lectures, or in reply to parliamentary interpellation. 
  Also, under the Planning Division are various deliberative 
bodies, including the Fiscal System Council, the Securities and 
Exchange Council, and the Financial Problems Forum. Thus, 
division members are in frequent contact with private-sector 
banks and those in other ministries and agencies to exchange 
views. The situation, says Division Chief Shirakawa, "hardly 
gives them any time during the day to sit down."

  [Text] BOJ Policy Planning Bureau/Coordination and 
Public Relations Divisions--Setting Up a Same Day Account 
Settlements System 
  The goals of the Bank of Japan, as defined in Article 1 of 
the Japanese Banking Law, are to regulate the money supply, 
control currency, and maintain and foster the credit system. For 
the Coordination Division of the Policy Planning Bureau--a 
division which examines the appropriateness of new operations to 
BOJ's objectives and then contacts and coordinates its actions 
with departments and agencies within and outside the central 
bank--Article 1 provides the most important rationale for 
whatever it undertakes. 
  By "coordinating" a matter after it has been studied and 
examined means making adjustments that are necessary for it to 
be in conformity with various rules and regulations that are 
pertinent to the bank's mission, including the Japanese Banking 
Law, articles of incorporation and bylaws. Of course, a wealth 
of knowledge about existing systems and regulations is required 
of staff, and the division is fully represented by those who 
have successfully passed the national law examination. 
  Last year, the division grappled with the task of converting 
the domestic exchange settlement system (All Bank System) into a 
system of same day funds and preparing the way for government 
bond accounts to be settled on a cash on delivery (or delivery 
versus payment [DVP]) basis. In either case, these are recalled 
by Division Chief Chikanobu Mori (1972) as "measures to respond 
to fluctuations in assets and the transactions of financial 
institutions." 
  The division is also responsible for carefully checking 
contracts between BOJ and outside groups when, for example, a 
computer system is introduced or equipment and furnishings are 
purchased. In other words, its members carefully watch if there 
aren't any mistakes in internal matters or in those related to 
outside agencies. 
  The Public Relations Division was inaugurated in May 1990 
when the Information Division, which until then had been in 
charge of general information, was reorganized as a window to 
the bank for other information organs. Its main work is to 1) 
arrange press conferences and interviews with the bank governor, 
2) assist in collecting news and information about the bank and, 
3) disseminate information and answer inquiries about the 
central bank. The third to head the unit since its 
reorganization, Division Chief Yasuo Nakayama (1976) notes that 
the BOJ has "recently been getting a lot of foreign media 
coverage." 
  As the recession drags on, the public has grown more 
critical 
of the central bank. As division chief, Nakayama wants to get to 
understand the sentiments and views of the public through closer 
contact with the mass media. At the same time, he wants to make 
the BOJ's views and policies more accessible to the public and 
"to build a two-way relationship."

  [Text] BOJ Credit Systems Bureau/Credit Systems 
Division--A Group Well-Versed in Laws and Regulations 
  The Credit Systems Bureau was born (in May 1990) out of the 
first large-scale organizational reform to be undertaken since 
the BOJ was founded. The Credit Systems Division, a pivotal 
component in the bureau, was formed when the maintenance of 
credit systems, until then under the divided charge of the 
General Affairs and Bank Examination Bureaus was made the 
responsibility of a single, newly created division. Behind this 
move was the failure of a series of financial institutions in 
the United States and concern about the stability of Japan's own 
financial system. 
  A new unit, which is headed by Eizo Kobayashi (Class of 
1992), still only the second division chief it has had. He came 
to his post May 1993 after heading the Bank Examination Division 
to replace his predecessor, Masaaki Shirakawa (1972), who headed 
the Credit Systems Division for three years before becoming 
division chief in charge of the Policy Planning Division. 
  As Kobayashi notes, "there seems to be no end in sight to 
what we still have to learn from other countries." As his words 
suggest, one of the division's priorities is to look into 
deposit insurance systems in other countries as case studies and 
to research financial regulatory systems at home and abroad. 
Therefore, the division has a group of people, including a 
Havard Law School graduate, who are very well-versed in law 
within the BOJ. 
  Also under the division's charge is the Committee of Bank 
Supervisors for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). 
From the start, the division has been involved in creating 
specific measures to deal with BIS's capital-to-asset ratio 
requirements, which were adopted by Japanese banks from March 
1993. 
  With plans to introduce a second set of regulations (market 
risk regulations) intended to address risks with fluctuations in 
the exchange and stock markets, the division has born part of 
the responsibility for creating new regulations while taking 
into account the views of Japan's financial institutions. 
  Since the division was formed, it has handled cases using 
the 
deposit insurance system when financial institutions have gone 
bankrupt, including mergers and aquisitions of Toho Mutual 
Savings and Loan Bank by Iyo Bank and of Toyo Credit Union by 
Sanwa Bank and the liquidation of Kamaishi Credit Union. It has 
become an important function of the Credit Systems Division to 
carefully the activities of financial instititutions and prevent 
trends from developing which might disrupt or cause creditors 
and depositors to lose confidence in the financial system.

  [Text] BOJ Credit Systems Bureau/Settlement System 
Division--Eliminating Inter-Bank Settlement Risks 
  One day, somewhere in the world, a bank fails and a 
financial 
institution in Japan, operating in a different time zone, finds 
it cannot recover the payments due on its loan. With the 
internationalization of financial markets and their 
computerization, the risk of nonpayment because of a lag in 
settlement dates caused by time differences or inadequacies in 
the system has grown and has become a concern for financial 
authorities throughout the world. 
  That worry became justified in July 1991 when financial 
authorities in Europe and the United States suddenly froze the 
accounts of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) 
due to their discovery of bank irregularities and misconduct. 
Repercussions were felt in Japan, when Nippon Kogyo Bank, which 
had been doing yen-dollar transactions with BCCI, reported a 
loss of about $30 million. 
  "A fairly strong sense of crisis took hold," recalls Hajimu 
Mizuno (1975), who currently heads the BOJ's Settlement 
Division. At the time he had just been transferred from the 
Information and Computer Systems Bureau to the Policy Planning 
Bureau's Coordination Division. Fearing a domino effect, the BOJ 
asked financial institutions in Japan to stay calm and, in 
effect, the incident passed without causing a major disruption 
to Japan's financial system. Rather, according to Mizuno, the 
BCCI incident "gave Japan's financial institutions a chance to 
realize, first hand, the importance of being able to respond to 
settlement risks." 
  While endeavoring to eliminate these risks, the Settlement 
System Division tackles the job of putting together plans and 
measures that will enable Japan's settlement system to operate 
with stability and efficiency. Mizuno assumed his current post 
as division chief last May and is highly regarded for his skills 
not only in responding to the BCCI incident but also in 
developing and putting into operation the central bank's 
[computer] network which enables accounts with private financial 
institutions to be settled immediately. A number of those in his 
division took part in developing this network, and with today's 
rapidly advancing technology at their command, they form a 
management team, which is highly skilled in the latest 
technology, to anticipate failures and risks inherent in their 
system. 
  Until last spring, private financial institutions, which had 
been using the system of next-day settlements (All Bank System) 
for domestic exchange accounts, changed to a system of same-day 
settlements. It was this division which was urging the necessity 
for such a change at the time, arguing that "the key antidote to 
risk was reducing outstanding balances on account." Based on 
plans drawn up by this division, the BOJ is also targeting the 
end of this fiscal year to introduce a DVP [delivery versus 
payment] system for government bonds, which would make it 
possible to receive payment for such bonds at the time they are 
surrendered or the delivery of bonds at the time of their 
purchase. 
  However, the kind of problem that surfaced in the BCCI 
case--the lag time in settlement dates for yen-foreign currency 
transactions--still has not been resolved. "We still have a lot 
to learn," says Mizuno. Apparently, this division's battle 
against risk will be continuing for awhile. 
<H5>  [12 Jan 94 p 2] </H5>
  [Text] BOJ Operations Bureau/Financial Division--On 
the Backline in Lending, on the Frontline in Restructuring 
  In the Financial Division of the Bank of Japan's Operations 
Bureau, there is a tacit understanding: If the division chief 
plans to be away on a long holiday, he is to indicate where he 
can be reached; in principle, vacations outside Japan are to be 
discouraged. The Financial Division stands on the frontlines of 
Japan's efforts to restructure its financial system. 
  Among the central bank's various roles, the one that falls 
to 
the Financial Division is that of "final lender." The division 
is in close contact with each of the financial institutions 
which have current accounts with the central bank and keeps a 
close, daily watch on their activities. City bank officials 
shrug their shoulders. "Whether you get financing or not is 
ultimately up to the Financial Division," says one. 
  Before being reorganized in May 1990, the General Affairs 
Division, which is in the Operations Bureau, was responsible for 
the day-to-day regulation of financial markets, but the job of 
supervising the flow and absorption of funds for these markets 
as a whole now falls to the Markets Division. This division, 
too, is in the Operations Bureau. The role of the Financial 
Division is to decide what to do about lending to individual 
financial institutions. 
  Important, along with regulating the fund raising activities 
of individual financial institutions, is the work of analyzing 
trends among financial institutions with regard to lending and 
deposits. "Window guidance," the practice whereby the BOJ 
determined lending limits for each bank, was abolished in July 
1991, but it is still necessary to monitor the activities of 
each bank in terms of how funds are absorbed and invested. 
  With the problem that has developed with regard to 
nonperforming loans, another important role for the division is 
responding to anxieties about the financial system and being 
able to prevent any future disruptions to the settlement system. 
A special team was formed last year to carefully monitor trends 
among nonbanks and companies specializing in housing loans, 
sectors which have been hard hit by nonperforming loans. 
  The reorganization of divisions was also an opportunity to 
shift the job of monitoring the international affairs of banks 
from the Foreign Division to the Financial Division. The aim was 
for this division to be able to monitor the domestic activities 
of individual banks as well as their activities abroad. Also 
coming under the charge of the Finance Division is the job of 
determining the soundness of the collateral offered by city 
banks when the BOJ extends credit to them. 
  The head position in the Financial Division, like the head 
position in the Planning Division, is considered a star post for 
aspiring bureaucrats. Eiji Hirano (Class of 1973), who 
represents the third-generation of division chiefs to head the 
financial unit, feels that "in addition to developing the 
banking sector's future image, it is necessary to create the 
kind of environment that fosters competitiveness among banks." 
He says he would like to see "financial deregulation bring out 
more diversity and individuality among banks."

  [Text] BOJ Operations Bureau/Securities 
Division--Groping Its Way Toward Structural Reform in the 
Capital Market 
  In December 1992, the Bank of Japan released a report titled 
"Regarding the Functions of the Stock Market." Its position, for 
the first time directly broaching the subject of stocks, sent 
ripples through the market community. The report, which pointed 
out the importance of the stock market as a way of restraining 
the behavior of firms, was co-authored by the Securities 
Division (Operations Bureau) together with the Research and 
Statistics Bureau. The analysis of the capital market by the 
Securities Division became the rationale for Governor Mieno's 
proposal last year for creating a market for the sale and 
purchase of nonperforming assets. After the conspicuous failure 
of capital market to function adequately following the collapse 
of the economic bubble, there has been more attention than even 
before on the Securities Division. 
  The 18-member division is located on the second floor of the 
BOJ building between offices occupied by the Markets Division 
and the Financial Division. Following the panic on the 
securities market in 1965, it was finally elevated to its 
present divisional status in 1968; it was formerly the 
"securities desk" in the bureau's General Affairs Division. The 
Operations Bureau's current setup, with its Markets Division, 
Financial Division, and Securities Division--is the result of 
the organizational reform that was undertaken in 1990. Because 
there are strong ties between these three divisions, two members 
of the Securities Division also work in the Markets Division. 
  The Securities Division collects information from securities 
firms with which the bank does business and monitors the ability 
of the capital market takes in and absorbs the central bank's 
directives. At the same time, its role is to pick up signals the 
market sends out and to input them into policy decisions. 
Compared to the Markets Division, which follows the market on 
daily basis, the Securities Division's role is to focus its 
attention on medium- and long-range problems. It guards a broad 
territory, and besides making recommendations to improve the 
system--for example, rationalizing corporate bond 
transactions--the division handles the job of assessing the 
market value of collateral securities when the bank loans out 
money. It also decides on suitable collateral. 
  Just as the Financial Division superintends bank operations, 
one of the duties of the Securities Division is to monitor the 
operations of securities firms. Its top priorities, however, are 
policies aimed at restructuring the market and other such 
macro-level analyses. Division Chief Nobuo Inaba (Class of 1974) 
says that, when the average price of listings on the Nikkei 
suddenly nose dived soon after he assumed his post in May 1992, 
the question constantly on his mind was "what cause the sudden 
drop and what could be done about it," he recalls. Compared to 
the money market, the capital market--to the degree that it is 
less within the reach of the government arm--seems for those at 
the central bank to be where the market principle has been taken 
in and assimilated to a greater degree. 
  With a strained smile, Inaba refers to the report released a 
year ago on the stock market. "We were told by those who work 
at securities firms," he says, "that matters are never that neat 
and clean." It looks as though it will be awhile yet before the 
Securities Division's goal--to build a better system in order to 
revitalize the capital market--will be able to actually change 
the real world.

  [Text] BOJ Operations Bureau/Markets 
Division--Monetary Regulation on a Day-to-Day Basis 
  When the Nikkei average suddenly fell to the 15,000 yen 
level 
at the end of November 1993, the Bank of Japan promptly moved to 
increase the supply of funds to financial markets and urged 
lowering of the interest on unsecured next-day call [loans]. 
Lower interest rates then spread to the 3-month CD market and, 
in December, were linked to a 0.375 percent drop in the 
short-term prime rate offered by city banks. In other words, by 
regulating the money supply, the central bank was carrying out 
an easy-money policy and trying to apply brakes to falling stock 
prices. The unit responsible for carrying out monetary 
regulation on a day-by-day basis is the Markets Division in 
BOJ's Operations Bureau. 
  The money market may be short of funds one day and 
oversupplied the next. In order to smooth out these bumps, 
monetary regulation sees to it that funds are supplied to or 
absorbed by the market. When funds continue to be slightly on 
the oversupply-side, it is taken as a sign of easy money. 
  Minoru Masubuchi (Class of 1966), a consultant to the 
Operations Bureau, is the man currently responsible for monetary 
regulation. "I'm still doing the same work I did when I was 
young and in charge of such matters," he says wryly. With 
increasing progress being made toward deregulation, interest 
rates on bank deposits and on loans have come to respond 
sensitively to the slightest monetary adjustment, and such 
adjustments have taken on an even greater importance. The 
short-term money market, where the central bank makes its 
adjustments to the money supply, is also becoming more tightly 
interconnected with the stock, securities, and foreign exchange 
markets. 
  Although all three divisions are under the Operations 
Bureau, 
it is the Markets Division that is becoming more closely tied to 
day-by-day monetary regulation and to monetary policy (for 
example, changes in the official discount rate) than the 
Financial and Securities Divisions. The Markets Division is 
under the overall supervision of Toshihiko Fukui (1958), a BOJ 
director who is also in charge of policy matters for the central 
bank. Both the Financial and Securities Divisions are under the 
charge of BOJ director Kunio Kojima (1960). 
  An accurate understanding of the financial markets is 
indispensable when determining monetary policy. Members of the 
Market Division, which has been called an "information 
switchboard," are on the telephone with financial institutions 
even before the markets open, assiduously trying to decipher 
even the slightest market trends. Division Chief Masanori Tanabe 
(1975), who took his post last May, says, "With the market 
expanding and transactions becoming more complicated, it is 
important, so as not to lose sight of the market's view on 
interest rates, to at least keep an open mind to the market's 
rich, diverse texture." 
<H5>  [18 Jan 94 p 2] </H5>
  [Text] BOJ Bank Examination Bureau/Bank Examination 
and Management Divisions--Looking for Sound Bank Management 
  "There was more commotion around here than we've ever seen." 
This is how Bank Examination Division Chief Yasuo Mizota (Class 
of 1972), a nine-year veteran of the bureau, characterizes last 
year in retrospect. 
  Certainly, it was a year to jolt the Bank Examination 
Bureau's equanimity. In January, it was reported that 
information from the bureau's examination of Mitsubishi Bank 
documents had gotten into other hands, perhaps leaked, and the 
bureau chief was penalized with a drop in pay. Then, again in 
October, several newspapers reported the same thing happening in 
the bureau's examination of Fuji Bank's documents. The BOJ 
denied the allegations, but interest has grown in its 
information management system. 
  Despite these events, it is also true, however, that in the 
midst of noticeably worsening bank profits, bank examinations 
are becoming increasingly important as a way of checking the 
soundness of bank management. "We must earn the people's trust 
by carrying out our business rigorously," stresses Mizota. 
  The bureau's examiners are sent into the field to do on-site 
inspections and, in so far as they check for trouble spots, are 
like the Ministry of Finance's banking inspectors. One 
difference is that the MOF inspections are mandatory since the 
ministry has supervisory authority over the banks. The BOJ's 
examinations, on the other hand, assume a relationship of trust 
between the central bank and the financial institutions which 
are its customers. Again, unlike the MOF's inspections, which 
are made without prior notice, the BOJ's examinations are 
scheduled one month in advance. 
  The Banking Examination Division actually carries out the 
examinations, to carry out the examinations, which are scheduled 
once every two-to-three years and usually last about three 
weeks. They are intended to give an accurate picture of the way 
banks are being managed and include interviews with bank 
officers and department heads, an inspection of the 
administrative operations of branch offices, and an inspection 
of bank documents. 
  More recently, the emphasis has been on bank's risk 
management system. This is because banks are now subject to more 
complicated, high-tech risks. In addition to the appearance of 
so-called derivatives (financial derivative commodities), for 
example, banks are turning increasingly to computer systems. 
Thus, there are also efforts within the Bank Examination 
Division to upgrade skills through staff training courses taught 
by its more experienced members. 
  The Management Division collects data related to a financial 
institution's management, including information on its profit 
situation. This information is collected on a regular basis and 
helps examiners during their site visits. Again, division 
members work closely with the Credit Systems and Operations 
Bureaus to consult on restructuring plans for financial 
institutions and then follow up on their progress. According to 
Division Chief Masahiro Sumikawa (Class of 1972), it is 
important, in order to maintain the stability of the financial 
system, to be able to see things through the eyes of the private 
sector. That attitude, he says, is something he wants his 
division to maintain.

  [Text] BOJ International Bureau/General Affairs, 
Foreign Exchange Divisions--Central Bank's Intervention Task 
Force 
  "The Bank of Japan [BOJ] is only one of many participants in 
the foreign exchange market. It can't control everything that 
happens." The speaker, the man who heads the International 
Bureau's Foreign Exchange Division, is Hirohisa Hashimoto (Class 
of 1974). Every day finds him hard at work trying to maintain 
"dialogue with the market." 
  It is the Foreign Exchange Division chief who leads in the 
troops when the central bank decides to intervene and influence 
the exchange rate. When Hashimoto stepped into that position 
June 1993, every passing day seemed to be boosting the yen to 
another record high, and it wasn't unusual for him to be 
awakened late at night by an overseas caller. Though daily 
exchanges of information with the Ministry of Finance 
International Finance Bureau's Foreign Exchange Division might 
be expected, quite unexpected was the volume of calls, day and 
night, from overseas central banks in New York, Germany, and 
other countries. 
  Despite of heroic efforts to intervene by selling off 
several 
billion dollars in yen currency, the exchange rate went $1 = 
100.40 yen on 17 August, thrusting the yen to the threshold of a 
new era. Two days later, on the 19th, however, the Federal 
Reserve Bank in New York intervened to stop the massive selling 
of yen and somehow prevented the exchange rate from breaking 
through the 100 yen per dollar mark. Hashimoto managed to escape 
a serious crisis in his battle with the market. 
  Qualified to act as the Minister of Finance's 
representative, 
the Foreign Exchange Division has the authority to intervene and 
buy or sell yen through the Foreign Exchange Fund Special 
Account. There are many ways to intervene. Depending on the 
situation, there may be efforts, for example, to "boost" the 
exchange rate level or to use some "behind-the-door" method. The 
Foreign Exchange Division will also undertake analyses of 
foreign economies with the primary aim of influencing exchange 
rates or investing in foreign markets using funds from Japan's 
foreign currency reserve. 
  The job of coordinating activities within the International 
Bureau, including the Foreign Exchange Division, falls to the 
General Affairs Division. It is headed by Fumiaki Kimura (Class 
of 1972), who likens his division to "the BOJ's international 
strategy task force." Its work concerns laws and regulations, 
such as the Foreign Exchange Control Law, as they pertain to 
negotiations with foreign countries and agencies like the 
Ministry of Finance. It also concerns official pronouncements by 
the Bank of Japan governor--at meetings of the foreign ministers 
and central bank governors of the Group of Seven Nations (G7) or 
at Bank for International Settlements (BIS) meetings of central 
bank governors. 
  As Division Chief Kimura has also been expending a great 
deal 
of his energies recently in establishing and maintaining 
relationships with Asian countries. In the past, economic 
diplomacy has been directed mainly toward Europe and the United 
States. This "Asia effort" means broadening Japan's economic 
ties with its more immediate neighbors through technical 
assistance and meetings with the heads of the central banks of 
some 11 Asian nations, including those of China and Southeast 
Asia. Last December, BOJ officials were also dispatched to 
Vietnam and Kyrgyzstan. Rather than the kind of bilateral ties 
that now exists between Japan and the United States and Japan 
and Europe, Kimura says his dream is to move toward 
"establishing multinational ties." 
<H5>  [20 Jan 94 p 2] </H5>
  [Text] BOJ International Bureau/International 
Financial Division, Investment Division, Balance of Payments 
Division--Struggling with Derivative Commodities 
  There is a theory--the "Age 35 Rule"--that says financial 
derivatives, which require a command of higher mathematics, is 
beyond the understanding of those past their mid-thirties. The 
International Financial Division's job is to look into these new 
products and devise the rules that will help eliminate the risks 
associated with them. For example, in the case of forward rate 
agreements (FAA), where the two parties involved agree on the 
interest rate to be paid at a future date, there is a question 
as to whether or not such estimates of future rates are a form 
of illegal gambling. Those in charge are charting new and 
unfamiliar territory, looking into laws and regulations, both 
national and foreign, they may never have imagined existed, and 
trying to understand if there are any market risks in such 
products. 
  "It's all Greek to someone like me, who is past 35," says 
Division Chief Shinichi Yoshikuni (Class of 1973). "But the 
younger ones look on this new area as a challenge." His staff, 
which (unusual for BOJ) includes a graduate of Tokyo 
University's Engineering Department, is wrestling with a problem 
that has become an urgent concern for every central bank in the 
world. Staff members here are also responsible for studying the 
economic situation in regions throughout the world. 
International specialists, some with experience working with the 
International Monetary Fund, are Asia- and U.S.-watchers, 
studying to see where the economies of these countries are 
headed. 
  The International Balance of Payments Division, on the other 
hand, collects microeconomic data regarding foreign countries 
and trade. Last August, for example, when the yen suddenly 
started to gain in value, the division held fact-finding 
hearings to address such questions as the impact of the stronger 
yen on export profits and on corporate plans to restructure or 
invest in plants and equipment. Staff members are constantly in 
touch with trading companies and manufacturers to put together 
figures on the balance of international payments. Their 
particular field is the collection and analysis of industrial 
data. Up-to-the minute information of this kind is then used as 
the basis for monetary policy decisions as it was last September 
when the official discount rate was lowered. 
  Another pressing task before the division is to revise, for 
the first time in 30 years, [the type of data it gathers for] 
its statistics on the balance of payments. Japan's statistics 
are singled out as being behind-the-times by foreign critics. 
Says Division Chief Takayoshi Hatayama (Class of 1973), "We want 
to restructure our statistics to reflect the trend toward 
securitization that has emerged and toward more services like 
lease transactions and get a better grasp of the money flow." 
  The Investment Division is entrusted by the minister of 
finance to superintend administrative matters concerning foreign 
exchanges such as the notification of receipt of foreign direct 
investments. With more and more progress being made toward 
internationalization, investment activities are getting more 
complicated every year. Understandably, Division Chief Kazuo 
Taneda (Class of 1972) is determined that his office will 
"respond with speed, clarity, and accuracy." 
<H5>  [21 Jan 94 p 2] </H5>
  [Text] BOJ Business Management 
Bureau/Divisions--Processing Data, Managing the Shop 
  The Bank of Japan's image is closely tied to its role as a 
policy organization, which implements monetary policies (for 
example, by manipulating the official discount rate) and 
measures to maintain and foster Japan's credit system. However, 
as its name implies, it is also a "bank." 
  The Business Management Bureau bears the responsibility for 
carrying out that role. Michiaki Morita (Class of 1972), who 
heads the General Affairs Division under this bureau, says of 
his goal: "As a banker's bank, we should be able to settle final 
accounts with the same ease that a fish takes to the water or 
bird takes to the air." His division is in charge of "regular 
business," as written in Article 20 of the Banking Law and is 
responsible for laying the groundwork which will facilitate the 
implementation of policy. 
  One of the Business Bureau's main jobs is processing and 
managing data. For example, the bank handles 30,000 transactions 
(receipts and payments), the equivalent of 300 trillion yen, 
each day in its business with financial institutions which have 
current accounts with the bank. It also handles 3,600 
transactions, the equivalent of 15 trillion yen, a day in 
settling government bond accounts. Again, as the National 
Treasury, it handles 500,000 transactions, or 4.5 trillion yen, 
per day in the receipt and disbursement of national funds such 
as annual pension funds. 
  Data concerning these transactions are quickly processed by 
four divisions: the Settlement of Accounts Division, the 
National Treasury Services Division, the National Treasury 
Accounting Division, and the Government Bonds and Securities 
Division. "Needless to say, the work in these divisions is very 
exacting," says Katsutada Akiyama (Class of 1974), who heads the 
General Coordinating Division. "They bear very heavy 
responsibilities." 
  With the installment of BOJ's computer network in 1988, it 
has been possible to effect large-scale rationalization in areas 
such as the settlement of bond accounts and transfers between 
current accounts. For disbursements of national funds, however, 
magnetic tapes are sent from the Ministry of Finance's 
accounting center, and on the basis of these tapes, itemized 
lists and portfolios are drawn up and distributed to financial 
institutions on a daily basis. Thus, the bureau is studying the 
possibility of switching in 1995 to computerized data processing 
in this area as well. 
  The Market Affairs Division puts monetary adjustments as 
specified by the Markets Division of the Operations Bureau into 
effect. It is through this "window," opened to private-sector 
financial institutions, that incentives to lower short-term 
interest rates are carried out. It is also this division that 
carries out the central bank's government bond operations. 
  The General Affairs Division works together with the 
Settlement System Division of the Credit Systems Bureau to study 
measures that can be taken to avoid non-payment or other 
settlement risks. According to Division Chief Morita, his staff 
is "considering various options that will enable accounts to be 
settled smoothly even in the unlikely event that a financial 
institution fails." The division is also giving its input into 
policy matters in order that the central bank's broad-ranging 
work can continue to proceed smoothly.

  [Text] BOJ Information and Computer Systems Bureau 
and Its Three Divisions--Providing Support for Japan's 
Settlement of Accounts System 
  Last July a "fortress" was unveiled in an industrial park in 
Fuchu (Tokyo). The gray-walled nine-story building dominates the 
scene, looking sturdy enough to easily withstand even a temblor 
on the scale of the Great Kanto Earthquake. It is here that the 
computer system which supports Japan's financial structure is 
located. It is the central bank's network, controlling account 
settlements between fellow financial institutions. 
  It is in this Fuchu annex, which the BOJ newly constructed 
to 
accommodate the growing volume of business it handles, that one 
finds the Information and Computer Systems Bureau ensconced far 
from the familiar environs of Nihonbashi. The bureau is in 
charge of developing, managing, and operating the entire 
computer system. 
  The General Affairs Division is in charge of the plans and 
proposals that are entered into the system and is also 
responsible for coordinating divisions and carrying out 
communications with them. The division's new chief, Michitaka 
Yoneda (Class of 1973), assumed his post October 1993. "BOJ's 
network," he says, "supports the settlement system, which is the 
infrastructure of Japan's economy," and thus forcefully argues 
the importance of its mission. 
  The Systems Development Division, with its staff of systems 
engineers, is involved in developing computer software. The 
Systems Operation Division's main job is to operate the system 
under normal circumstances and to be ready to respond when 
problems arise. 
  Two important themes informing the development of the system 
were efficiency and stability. BOJ's network, which was put into 
operation in 1988, was equipped to meet both of these criteria. 
  The current account deposits which banks and other 
institutions make with the central bank and build up as their 
reserve deposit are also used when banks exchange funds among 
themselves for domestic and foreign exchange transactions and 
for check clearances. 
  Before, in order to transfer funds from such current 
accounts, a bank official would have to go to one of the central 
bank's teller windows and present a written request for the 
transfer. With the establishment of BOJ's computer network, 
however, the entire transaction can now be completed very simply 
at one of the computer terminals at the withdrawer's bank. Of 
course, in order to access BOJ's net by terminal, users will 
have to negotiate many layers of safeguards that have been put 
into place (for example, they will have to have the appropriate 
identification card and password). The system is also completely 
"hacker-safe." 
  The Information and Computer Systems Bureau has also 
undertaken the development of a system to process information 
for use within the central bank. It also provides support, from 
the computer and systems end, for the delivery of taxes to the 
National Treasury, located in the central bank; for the 
disbursement of pension funds; for the management of financial 
statistics; and for the purposes of understanding the loan 
status or fund raising status of individual financial 
institutions. Sometimes systems development falls prone to the 
error of not keeping up with the latest technology. Conversely, 
it may latch on to technology that is so new as to be virtually 
unusable. The task then, says Division Chief Yoneda, is to "find 
a way to incorporate the best technology in a timely fashion," a 
task which is easier said than done when advances in technology 
are, as he says, occurring so rapidly.

  [Text] BOJ Research and Statistics Bureau/Economic 
Research Division, Planning and Research Division--Research in 
Step With Real World Realities 
  Critics said, "The Economic Planning Agency announced the 
recession has bottomed out. Why hasn't the Bank of Japan?" 
Pressed by such critics, Akinari Horii (Class of 1974), head of 
the Economic Research Division, responded May 1993 with a 
statement that there were no signs to a recovery. Unfortunately, 
there has been no change in the economic recovery as Horii 
predicted. 
  The Economic Research Division has the onerous 
responsibility 
of making economic assessments. The macro-side, his staff 
pursues trends in personal consumption and plant and equipment 
investment and, on the micro-side, financial trends and trends 
in corporate supply and demand. Equipped with this data and 
other information gathered from its branch offices, staff then 
put together the material that becomes the basis for economic 
assessments. This is done every quarter. 
  Besides having worked in the Ministry of Finance, Horii has 
been assigned on temporary loan to work at the Bank for 
International Settlements as well as the World Peace Institute, 
which was established by former Prime Minister Nakasone. 
Including his years as an exchange student in the United States, 
he says, "out of my 20 years with the bank, eight were spend 
abroad." Which may be why, as he says, "the aim of our research 
is not necessarily to fit in with BOJ's reality but with the 
wider reality outside our doors." 
  After Horii assumed his present post, that attitude has 
shown 
itself in the fact that the texts for public statements about 
the economy are written concisely and in a way easily understood 
by the general public. His aim, he says, is not to be swayed by 
policy or other such considerations but to produce "research 
that is accurate and neutral." 
  If the Economic Research Division is likened to a regular 
army, in charge of studying economic trends over a certain 
period of time, then the bureau's irregular army is the Planning 
and Research Division, which undertakes studies targeting 
specific problems. "Shouldn't there be a quantitative measure we 
can use to judge the progress companies are making in adjusting 
their balance sheets?" "Is there an indicator we can use instead 
of money supply?" These are the kinds of probing questions this 
division asks. 
  Its division chief is Kunio Okina (Class of 1974), a man 
with 
a scholarly bent, who has had many years of experience working 
at the BOJ Financial Institute and as an assistant professor at 
the University of Tsukuba (teaching international monetary 
theory). Economic Analysis of Expectation and 
Speculation, called by Ryuichi Tate, Tokyo University 
professor emeritus, "probably the first systematic study in the 
world on the bubble phenomenon," was released in 1985, early 
pointing out the dangers of an inflationary "bubble" economy. 
  However, as Division Chief Okina reflects, "The publication 
came out too early to sound any alarms." Since then, he adheres 
to the view that research should be "a half step ahead of the 
economy." "If it tries to be two steps ahead," he says, "its 
findings won't be accepted." Given the dizzying speed at which 
the economic and financial situation changes, one can understand 
his determination to choose only those research topics that have 
the greatest time value.

  [Text] BOJ Research and Statistics Bureau/Economic 
Statistics Division, Commodity Price Statistics 
Divison--Economic Statistics, Promptly Compiled 
  It was at 1345 on 10 December 1993, a crowd of over 500 
stood 
at the east gate of the Bank of Japan building. They were from 
corporations and private research groups trying to get 
just-released copies of the November edition of BOJ's 
Short-Term Economic Survey of Principal Enterprises in 
Japan. 
  As such scenes may indicate, interest is very high these 
days, not only at home but also overseas, in Japan's economy and 
particularly the kind of economic indicators that are released 
by the Bank of Japan and other knowledgeable sources. This is 
all the more true because of Japan's prolonged business slump 
and the lack of any visible signs of an exit door. Because BOJ's 
short-term survey contains both current data and information 
stretching back over many years, it is widely used by other 
government agencies and research groups to gain an understanding 
of the current state of the economy as well as to make forecasts 
and predictions about its future course. 
  It is the Economic Statistics Division which handles the 
analysis and questionnaire survey. The division has a staff of 
about 40 people working on the Short-Term Survey, 
either in the corporate statistics group or in the financial 
statistics group, which is responsible for compiling data on 
deposits and loans and the money supply. Their goal, says 
Division Chief Mitsuo Fujimoto (Class of 1972), is to "work 
expediously to compile statistics that have a high degree of 
precision and reliability so as to reflect the actual state of 
the economy." That attitude shows itself in the fact that the 
number of those surveyed for the November edition has been 
increased to nearly 3,000 companies, many of the additional 
respondents coming from smaller enterprises and from the 
nonmanufacturing sector. 
  Also important in getting an accurate picture of the economy 
are trends in the price of goods and services. The corporate 
service price index and wholesale price index are compiled by 
the Commodity Price Statistics Division, which is headed by 
Hiroshi Nakagawa (1975). "Commodity prices," he explains, "are a 
measure of the value of the currency. They are also like body 
temperature.' [A good thermometer] will register trends in goods 
and services." 
  The division's work covers three areas: 1) thermometry 
(compiling statistics), 2) assessing changes in temperature 
(analysis), and 3) polishing thermometers (improving research 
and analytical methods). For example, to take the case of the 
wholesale price index, over 1,200 items are covered. This is 
over 90 percent of all products and merchandise traded among 
businesses. To get this data, staff members will actually go to 
the company or will make inquiries by phone and then enter their 
findings into computer terminals. Statistics are compiled at the 
beginning, in the middle, and at the end of each month. 
  The Bank of Japan states the objective of monetary policy is 
the launch Japan's economy "on the road to sustainable, 
inflation-less growth." These economic and commodity price 
statistics are important sign posts for the bank in giving 
direction to monetary policy.

  [Text] BOJ Institute for Monetary and Economic 
Studies--Emphasizing Long-Term Returns on Basic Research 
  Walking down the red-carpeted corridors on the second floor 
of the old Bank of Japan building, one's eyes are drawn to the 
portraits of bank governors, past and present, which are hanging 
on the walls. Unlike the busy corridors of the headquarters of 
the central bank, the atmosphere here is quiet. The room at the 
end of the corridor belongs to BOJ's Institute for Monetary and 
Economic Studies. 
  The institute assumed its present form in 1982--the same 
year 
as BOJ celebrated its 100th anniversary. At the time of the 
institute's founding, then governor Haruo Maekawa spoke of the 
reason for establishing the institute. 
  "What we anticipate from the institute," he said, "is basic 
research which will be of valuable use, if not immediately, then 
at least in the long run. It may seem at times to be research 
that is irrelevant to our immediate interests or that it is a 
long, roundabout way to get somewhere. But if we lengthen our 
horizons and take a long-term view, we ought to be able to see 
its value as one important link among many." 
  An important difference between the institute and the 
Research and Statistics Bureau is that, while the latter 
provides the basic data from which to make daily policy 
decisions, the institute stresses basic research which will be 
useful in the long term. Researchers, here, are not only limited 
to in-house staff but are also brought in from outside the bank. 
According to Hiroo Taguchi (1971), who heads the First Research 
Division, "an important role of the institute is to serve as a 
bridge between the academic world and the real world of finance." 
  The Research Institute has three divisions. The First 
Division, which Taguchi heads, is concerned with theoretical 
research dealing with basic questions about economies, monetary 
matters, and public finance. The Second Division is involved in 
research on regulations and systems related to economic problems 
and the Third Division, historical research. The Third Division 
is also in charge of running the famous Currency Museum as one 
of its field study courses. 
  Research findings are published every month in Kinyu 
kenkyu, a collection of papers covering a broad range of 
research topics. Among the subjects covered in recent issues, 
for example, one finds papers titled: "Regarding Consumer Logic 
and Currency Demand" (December 1993), "Problems Concerning the 
Tax System and Financial Accounting" (October 1993), and "An 
Observation Regarding Deposit Insurance and Moral-Hazard 
Risk-Neutral Insurance Premiums" (October 1992). 
  In each case the research represents a very specialized 
field 
of interest and yet is related to a current concern. For 
example, the paper on deposit insurance in the October 1992 
issue. When viewed in light of events in the United 
States--where troubled banks have rushed to get insured 
deposits--the relationship between deposit insurance and the 
presence of moral hazard incentives needs to be considered in 
Japan as well. While it is basic research, it is research that 
tries to incorporate a contemporary perspective. This seems to 
be, in fact, one of the research institute's distinctive 
features.

  [Text] MPT Postal Savings Bureau/Operations and 
Planning Division--Building the Framework for Deregulation 
  The deregulation of interest rates on current, or floating, 
deposits has become the target of a great deal of interest and 
concern among private financial institutions. Hoping to put the 
deregulation of interest rates into effect by mid-1994, the 
Ministries of Finance [MOF] and Posts and Telecommunications 
[MPT] are on the final leg of their negotiations. Trying to 
build the framework for deregulation on the MPT side is the 
Planning Division in the Postal Savings Bureau. 
  This is the division, considered the "brains" of the Postal 
Savings Bureau, which is involved in creating "products" 
[savings account plans] that are more attractive to depositors. 
It also formulates proposals to amend any regulations affecting 
such accounts. The unit is considered an elite post for those 
assigned there as division chief, a position held at one time or 
another by a number of the ministry's top-ranking officials. The 
current head of the Postal Savings Bureau, Akemi Yamaguchi 
(Class of 1963), and Chief Secretary Tsuyoshi Kimura (1966), for 
example, were both formerly division chiefs here. The man who 
currently heads the Operations and Planning Division, Chikanori 
Saio (1974), has been with the Postal Savings Bureau since 1989. 
  The Operations and Planning Division is one of the few 
places 
that will receive advance notice of a change in the official 
discount. Word will be passed quietly into the chief's ear by a 
member of the Ministry of Finance. Communications of this sort 
is necessary because changes in the official discount rate are 
closely tied to changes in the interest paid on postal savings 
accounts. After last June's deregulation of interest rates on 
fixed-amount savings accounts, the most popular type of postal 
account, only the interest on regular savings accounts remained 
linked to the official discount rate. Before June 1993, advance 
word of a change would come several days before the change took 
effect. When the official discount rate was lowered in September 
[1993], however, word came only the night before. Perhaps, after 
regular savings account interest rates are deregulated, contact 
between the Ministry of Finance and the Operations and Planning 
Division--at least over the matter of the official discount 
rate--will stop entirely. 
  Instead, what has become more important work for the 
division 
is deciding on interest rates for fixed term (new fixed-term) 
and fixed-amount savings. Here, the decisions have to be made on 
the basis of trends in market interest rates. As a rule, rates 
change for fixed-term savings every Monday and for fixed-amount 
savings on the first and third Mondays of each month. But the 
Operations and Planning Division announces changes in its rates 
on the Monday prior to their taking effect. Private financial 
institutions, which have competing fixed-term savings accounts, 
are very interested in those figures. 
  Questions concerning current deposits, which have become the 
focus of much attention recently, are handled directly within 
the Operations and Planning Division by the unit set up to 
promote financial deregulation. This unit is headed by Seiji 
Katsuno (1978), an expert of long standing in the savings area. 
Negotiations on how to decide what the interest rate on regular 
savings accounts should be (it is now 1.32 percent per annum) 
are sailing on rough waters, and since last autumn Katsuno's 
unit has been swamped with work as negotiation with the Ministry 
of Finance continues.

CSO 

  With a 180 trillion yen balance on account, postal savings 
make up 30 percent of all individual savings and deposits 
nationwide. The job of the Fund Operation Division is to invest 
these funds and to provide for their repayment to depositors and 
savers. 
  This is not to say the MPT has the entire amount to invest. 
Once customer deposits are transferred to the Fund Operation 
Department of the Ministry of Finance, most of it is lend to 
government-related financial institutions or used to underwrite 
government bonds. Only the remainder is available for the 
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to invest at its own 
discretion. These funds are called "financial deregulation 
countermeasure funds" [hereafter, "response funds"] and can be 
borrowed from the Fund Operation Department to be invested by 
the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. 
  Estimates for fiscal 1993 place the total amount of postal 
funds on deposit with the Fund Operation Department at 10.4 
trillion yen; about 4.75 trillion yen will be returned to the 
MPT as response funds. Of the outstanding balance, approximately 
180 trillion yen at the end of fiscal 1993, about 25 trillion 
yen is expected to be invested by MPT at its own discretion. 
  Kiyoshi Mori (Class of 1973) assumed the head post in the 
Fund Operation Division in 1992. A veteran in the 
telecommunications field, this is his first assignment in the 
Postal Savings Bureau, but he is proving to be an able leader, 
bringing fresh, new ideas into the division. When entering the 
division, one's eyes are drawn to a magnificent dealing room in 
the back. At meetings convened at 0830 every morning, dealers 
exchange information with each other, including their views on 
the previous day's activities and trends on foreign markets. 
They then begin their day's work. There are 16 dealers. Often 
the division receives advice on investments from organs 
affiliated to the ministry like the Postal Savings Fund Research 
Association--a collection of "investment pros" who are on loan 
to the association from various securities firms. 
  About one-half of all response funds which are targeted for 
investments are put into government and regional bonds. These 
funds are also invested in corporate bonds, bank debentures, and 
foreign bonds. Again, of the funds placed in designated unit 
investments, which are handled by trust banks via the Postal 
Life Insurance Welfare Corporation (an affiliate of the MPT), 
some are directed into stocks. 
  Designated unit investments fall into one of two categories: 
"new designated units" place no restriction on the amount that 
can be invested in stock ([unit] investments in fiscal 1993 
amounted to 500 billion yen); "old designated units" limit such 
investments to 30 percent of the total ([unit] investments in 
this case amounted to 450 billion yen in 1993). There has been 
no indication of what percent of the division's investments have 
gone into the stock market, nor what issues were bought. All one 
is told, according to Chief Mori, is that the division's 
"investments are undertaken with the objective of maximizing 
profit returns to the [depositor]." 
  One thing that has been said about "public funds" like 
postal 
savings deposits, however, is that they have played an important 
role in maintaining stock prices through the government's PKO 
(price-keeping operation) policy. Nor does there seem to be an 
end to speculations circulating on the market about the Fund 
Operation Division.

  [Text] MPT Post Office Life Insurance 
Bureau/Operations and Planning Division--Racking Brains To Come 
Up with a New Product 
  The Post Office Life Insurance Bureau's Operations and 
Planning Division seems to have a counterpart in private 
enterprise: it is responsible for developing new products. In 
this case, a new insurance plan with new coverage terms and new 
incentives to join. Staff launches a new product every year 
after coordinating its efforts with government organs like the 
Ministry of Finance. 
  The work of coordinating its plans with the Ministry of 
Finance progresses in tandem with the ministry's work to draft a 
new fiscal budget. The outcome of the division's "battle over 
the budget" this time was mixed. "We lost one round and won a 
round," says Division Chief Itsuo Ooyu. The round he and his 
staff won was over a plan to increase annuity payments when the 
annuitant became bedridden. The round they lost was about a new 
endowment plan that would pay the insured a one-time, lump-sum 
payment at the time of childbirth. This plan was rejected by 
MOF. During the past several years, the Operations and Planning 
Divisin has been on a winning streak, and in April 1992, the 
enrollment age for regular old-age insurance was raised from 65 
to 70; in April 1993, insurance payments for insurees under 
special contract were raised; and from January 1994, a combined 
educational endowment and scholarship annuity plan was started. 
  For its part, the MOF has maintained: "there is no need for 
a 
large-scale revision of products every year." Chief Ooyu (Class 
of 1972), whose area of specialty is operations and systems, is 
an old hand in the Insurance Bureau. When the issue of 
establishing an endowment plan paying a lump-sum at the time of 
childbirth came up, he said he felt the MOF people had dug in 
their heels and wouldn't budge. "Private insurance was 
experiencing a slump," he says, "and the ministry had put up its 
guard with respect to trying to come out with a stronger 
product." 
  Again, with regard to raising the upper limits for insurance 
payments (currently set at 13 million yen), it was decided to 
put the proposal on the back burner for awhile. "We felt it 
would be useless to try to push it this year," says Ooyu, "so we 
didn't push it to start with." While he agrees, "the role of the 
Operations and Planning Division is to strive to respond to 
subscriber needs," there seems to be a sense within the division 
that every possible new product has already been thought up, and 
staff seems to be at a loss for any new ideas. 
  A new unit, the Financial Deregulation Response Office, was 
set up within the division in June 1991 to respond to reforms in 
the insurance system. Unlike the Financial Deregulation 
Promotion Office (in the Postal Savings Bureau), which is busy 
dealing with the deregulation of interest on current deposits, 
the Response Office, according to Ooyu, "isn't yet sitting in 
the hot corner.'" Because MOF's insurance reform hasn't gone 
very far yet, things are still in the state of preparation.

  [Text] MPT Postal Insurance Bureau/Fund Operation and 
Planning Division--Postal Insurance Funds, Free To Invest the 
Entire Lot 
  Postal insurance funds, said to total 65 trillion yen (as of 
the end of fiscal 1992), are different from postal savings and 
deposit funds in that the entire amount can be invested by the 
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT] at its own 
discretion. The unit which decides on the investment plan is the 
Postal Insurance Bureau's Fund Operation and Planning Division, 
which is also involved in reforming the insurance fund system. 
The actual responsibility for investments falls to First and 
Second Fund Operation Divisions. 
  One finds that close to 60 percent of all insurance funds as 
of the end of fiscal 1992 went to financial investment and loan 
institutes and local public entities as loans or toward the 
purchase of bonds. Thirteen percent also went into the purchase 
of corporate bonds, bank debentures, and foreign bonds and 
another 11 percent was invested in stocks and bonds by way of 
designated unit investments, which were made by trust banks on 
behalf of Postal Life Insurance Corporation, an affiliate of the 
MPT. The chief of the Funds Operation and Planning Division, 
Michihiro Fujioka (Class of 1975) took up his current post last 
year after heading the First Fund Operation Division. When it 
comes to investing postal insurance funds, he is said to have a 
"feel for the lay of the land." 
  For actual investments, advice is sometimes sought from PI 
Investment Consultants, a consulting firm that was established 
in 1993 through funding of the MPT's affiliates. The firm is 
staffed by personnel on temporary loan from trust banks 
  Operation of the life insurance funds include designated 
unit 
investments, which are attracting a lot of attention because of 
their association with government efforts to maintain stock 
prices through a PKO (price-keeping operation). Through fiscal 
1993, investments in designated units amounted to 7.62 trillion 
yen. In fiscal 1994 there are plans to add another 1.5 trillion 
yen. 
  With system reforms slated to take effect next fiscal year, 
the MPT has attempted to ease the burden on Postal Life 
Insurance Corporation and, for a certain portion of designated 
unit investments, has revised rules governing the makeup of 
portfolios. This revision is the outcome of constant, ongoing 
negotiations between Fujioka and the Ministry of Finance. At 
this stage, of all This revision is the outcome of constant, 
ongoing designated unit funds, 50 to 60 percent are slated for 
stock investments. "With system reform," says Fujioka, "we will 
have the kind of environment that should facilitate stock 
investments." He adds, he would like to "raise our stock 
investment ratio."

  [Text] MAFF Economic Affairs Bureau/Agricultural 
Cooperative Division--Helmsman for Agricultural Cooperative 
Administration 
  As the troubles of housing loan companies, carriers of large 
amounts of nonperforming loans, continued to surface during the 
summer of 1992, concern spread among financial institutions that 
were affiliated with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and 
Fisheries [MAFF] who were also providing housing-related loans. 
The group involved in hammering out measures to respond to the 
crisis together with the Ministry of Finance and Bank of Japan 
was MAFF's Agricultural Cooperative Division. The division 
oversees Agricultural Cooperative Credit Unions, who have been 
having a hard time since the collapse of the bubble economy. 
  Agricultural cooperatives are organized on three levels: on 
the local level, there are the Individual Municipal Agricultural 
Cooperatives; then, there is the Prefectural Credit Federation 
of Agricultural Cooperatives; and finally, the Norinchukin Bank. 
The Agricultural Cooperatives Division is in charge of the 
Municipal Cooperatives and the Prefectural Credit Federations. 
Back in the era when Agricultural Cooperatives were operating in 
a stable environment, the position of division chief was 
considered to be a relatively light-weight one though, in fact, 
the calibre of men who have held this post since 1980 has been 
on the order of division chiefs like Taichiro Okawahara 
(currently a Diet man in the lower house), who rose to the rank 
of vice minister. In any case, the situation for agricultural 
cooperatives these past several years has completely changed. 
  In addition to a succession of ill-fated securities 
investments, agricultural cooperatives are carrying housing 
loans in excess of 6 trillion yen--a situation which has weighed 
heavily on shoulders of the division. Thus, a special 
"inspector's office" has been set up within the division to 
provide inspections of agricultural cooperatives. A succession 
of able young men have also been assigned to the division to 
take the helm. Included are former division chief Yoshio 
Kobayashi (Class of 1973) and Hiroyuki Kinoshita (1971), who 
currently heads the division. 
  "Because of the self-help nature of cooperatives," says 
Kinoshita, "government agencies haven't intervened very much in 
their affairs." But with financial deregulation and the 
government's decision to liberalize the rice market, "the 
agricultural industry is at a major turning point in its history 
and," he stresses, "there's bound to be an understandable 
distance between us in our positions on some issues." 
  An immediate task is to restructure the corpulent 
agricultural cooperative organizations. But the idea of merging 
the Prefectural Credit Federation with the Norinchunkin Bank and 
thus just having a simpler, two-tiered structure consisting of 
the central bank, on one level, and the individual municipal 
agricultural cooperatives, on another level, is moving forward 
very slowly. When will legislation to promote the merger of the 
Prefectural Credit Federation and Norinchukin Bank be put before 
the Diet? The question comes down to the ability of those at 
the helm of the agricultural cooperative administration.

  [Text] MAFF Economic Affairs Bureau/Finance 
Division--Directing, Overseeing Strategy of Norinchukin Bank 
  A subject that has elicited a lot of talk is the 
diversification strategy of the Norinchukin Bank. A giant among 
institutional investors, the Nochukin moves some 40 trillion yen 
belonging to the agricultural cooperatives. Last year, it formed 
a securities subsidiary and later a subsidiary investment trust 
company. Also moving right along are preparations to issue 
"preferred investment securities," which will come from a broad 
base of funds. Directing and overseeing this strategy is MAFF's 
Finance Division. 
  The division is in charge of overseeing and providing 
direction to the Norinchukin Bank as well as the Agriculture, 
Forestry, and Fisheries Finance Corporation and Agriculture, 
Forestry, and Fisheries Credit Found, which are two 
government-affiliated financial institutions. In preparing for 
the liberalization of rice, the division bears an important role 
in agricultural administration in such matters as creating a 
low-interest loan system through the Norinchukin Bank and the 
Agriculture Finance Corporation. Top executives of the 
Norinchukin Bank and government-affiliated financial 
institutions have traditionally come from the "former officials" 
circle of Agriculture's vice ministers. The Finance Division 
must also serve as a pipeline between this fraternity of vice 
ministers and Agriculture's top bureaucrats. 
  Those assigned to the head position in the Finance Division, 
then, are on an elite course within the ministry. Not a few vice 
ministers have taken this course, including Sakue Matsumoto 
(currently chairman, Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries 
Industrial Technology Conference), Fumio Watanabe (Ibaraki 
Prefecture Governor) and Yoshihiro Hamaguchi (chairman, BRAIN 
[Bio-Oriented Technology Research Advancement Institute]). The 
executive ranks also include people who once served as Finance 
Division chiefs like Economic Bureau Chief Takeki Manabe (Class 
of 1963). "At the very least, the elite course will lead to a 
bureau chief's post somewhere within the ministry. 
  According to Fumio Tahara (1972), the man who currently 
heads 
the division, "agricultural cooperatives are in a period of 
unprecedented change." With the bubble's collapse, profits are 
tight on the local cooperative level as well as on the 
prefectural level among the credit federations. The third-tier 
is also having a tough time. According to Tahara, "the 
Norinchukin Bank is faced with its own investment problems." But 
the same sense of crisis felt by banks and securities firms 
still hasn't filtered down into the cooperatives--a fact which 
is making government policy difficult. Says Tahara, "They have 
to be more realistic, and be ready to respond to change."

  [Text] MOF Banking Bureau/General Affairs 
Division--Financial Administration's "General Manager" 
  On 8 February, the day the government announced its 15.25 
trillion yen economic stimulus package, Toshiharu Kitamura 
(Class of 1969), General Affairs Division chief in the Ministry 
of Finance's Banking Bureau, read his carefully prepared report 
titled "Administrative Guidelines Concerning the Nonperforming 
Assets of Financial Institutions." The guidelines, intended to 
bring stability to the financial system, include recommendations 
for more flexibility with regard to non-tax exempt write-offs, 
improving the liquidity of interest-exempt credit and giving 
assistance to financial institutions planning to merge. The 
report is the work of the General Affairs Division, the Banking 
Bureau's "general manager." 
  The General Affairs Division is the general managing unit 
for 
monetary and fiscal administration and is subdivided into a 
number of smaller units. The "general affairs desk" manages 
general administrative matters concerning the various divisions 
within the Banking Bureau. The "correspondence desk" handles 
Diet-related correspondence and documents and contacts with 
other bureaus. The "planning desk" is involved with plans and 
proposals related to policy matters in general, and the "Bank of 
Japan desk" manages bureau matters related to the central bank. 
Thus, the General Affairs Division sees a wide range of incoming 
intelligence on financial matters. 
  Understandably, the division chief's position is a very 
important one, and not a few of its alumni have been considered 
suitable candidates for the Banking Bureau's head post. 
Kitamura, an old-hand in the Banking Bureau, was promoted to his 
current position as division chief last June. He is known in 
financial circles as a conscientious, hard-working official and 
has earned the trust of his immediate supervisor, Banking Bureau 
Chief Nobuyuki Teramura (1961). 
  Masamichi Kono (1978), a planning official, is Kitamura's 
assistant and had a central role in putting together the 
administrative guidelines for dealing with nonperforming assets. 
He was also Kitamura's chief assistant when Kitamura headed the 
Banking Division, and the two again teamed up to cope with the 
crisis that has followed the collapse of bubble economy. 
  The Financial Markets Office is also under the jurisdiction 
of the General Affairs Division. The office was created as a 
small unit in June 1989, but its importance is growing as a 
"window" for negotiations with the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications. Besides attending to the regulation of 
interest rates on savings and deposits following changes in the 
official discount rate, the office has recently been involved in 
negotiations regarding the deregulation of interest on floating 
deposits, one of the final steps in the deregulation of interest 
rates. 
  Two separate positions are being taken with regard to the 
deregulation of interest on floating deposits. On the one hand, 
financial institutions in the private sector maintain that 
interest on regular postal savings accounts should follow the 
lead taken by interest on regular bank deposits. The Ministry of 
Finance supports this stance. The Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications has opposed it. To get the two sides to come 
together will likely be a test of the negotiating skills of 
Toyonari Sasaki (1976), the man (formerly with the Small Banks 
Division) now in charge of the Financial Markets Office.

  [Text] MOF Banking Bureau/Banking 
Division--Garrisoning a Broad Territory, Division Is Busier Than 
Ever 
  The "MOF man in charge." This broad appellation, a popular 
reference to the men in the Ministry of Finance [MOF] who are in 
charge of supervising private financial institutions, covers 
everything from policy to personnel matters. Most frequently, 
one finds these men in offices of the Banking Division. Because 
they cover a broad territory--city banks, regional banks, 
long-term credit banks, and trust banks--they travel many 
different roads. 
  As a supervisory agency of the government, the Banking 
Division has to understand everything of importance about the 
banking industry, from the profit situation of individual banks 
and the operations of branch offices to their various management 
plans. Although no longer its responsibility, the amount of 
nonperforming loans that banks are saddled with, a figure which 
each bank is now responsible for releasing on its own, was also 
the Banking Division's job to tally up and report. 
  "It has gotten so that I don't have any time to sit down and 
talk leisurely with the desk chiefs or division chief's 
assistant," says the MOF man in charge of city banks. A veteran 
in this field, he seems astonished at how busy the Banking 
Division has gotten recently. It means work for the "MOF man in 
charge." For city banks, the overriding interest at this time is 
entering the securities field through subsidiary companies. But 
in consideration of the effect such moves would have on the 
operations of existing securities firms, the idea of putting 
limits on the number of such banks entering the field has taken 
very strong hold. Given this situation, the Banking Division's 
intentions in its negotiations with the Securities Bureau 
becomes very important information to have. Another is MOF's 
response to the nonperforming loan problem. There are, in fact, 
"a mountain of things" one would like to ask these MOF men. 
  The division chief of Banking, Toshiyuki Tsukazaki (1970), 
has an unusually wide circle of contacts in the financial world 
even for someone in the Banking Bureau. During his days as chief 
of the Research Division, he was involved in drafting the 
Financial System Reform Bill, which recognized the idea of banks 
and securities firms entering each other's turf through 
subsidiary companies, and as chief of the Small Banks Division, 
was involved in drafting a proposal for the restructuring of 
housing loan companies. 
  Yoji Ninomiya (1975) is in charge of matters concerning the 
overseas activities of banks. He was promoted from his position 
as an assistant to the division chief to his current post as 
division planning official in view of the impact BIS agreements, 
such as those concerning capital-to-asset ratio requirements, 
would have on the operations of the banks. Also commanding some 
urgency are regulatory groundwork and preparations regarding the 
introduction into Japan's banking system of netting contracts to 
settle mutual obligations.

  [Text] MOF Banking Bureau/Special Banks 
Division--Administrative Guidance, The Dilemma of Public Versus 
Private 
  The Banking Bureau's Special Banks Division often receives 
faxed "requests" from politicians. They are almost always a 
request that special consideration be given to a supporter 
seeking a loan from one of the government-affiliated financial 
institutions. 
  The Special Banks Division's main work is to provide 
supervision and guidance to government-affiliated financial 
institutions, including the Japan Development Bank, the 
Export-Import Bank of Japan, and the Housing Loan Corporation. 
Since these are government-affiliated institutions, politicians 
seem to think all they need to do is ask and something can be 
done. But, in fact, says Special Banks Division Chief Kazuto 
Nishikawa (Class of 1971), "it's impossible to go around 
intervening in individual cases." 
  The role of government-affiliated financial institutions is 
to provide long-term, stable funds at a low interest in areas 
where the private sector response has been inadequate. In other 
words, these loans are merely meant to supplement private 
efforts. Because of the government's economic stimulus package, 
however, public loans are assuming an increasingly larger share 
of the loan market. Criticism is also growing in the private 
sector about "the pressure government enterprises are putting on 
private industry." 
  "There is a lot of misunderstanding in such criticisms," 
says 
Nishikawa. Because private lending is stagnant, government 
activities have come more noticeably to the fore. But, says 
Nishikawa, "that doesn't mean we've gone too far with government 
lending." "What would have happened to Japan's economy if we 
didn't have these government-related activities?" he asks, 
convinced of the answer. 
  On the other hand, an unusual situation has developed over 
the past several months. Government-affiliated financial 
institutions raise funds using the interest from government 
investments. These funds are then loaned out with interest. 
Since last November [1993], however, the long-term prime rate 
has fallen substantially, and the basic interest on their loans 
are now higher than those of private lenders. 
  This time, critics are charging that, with their higher 
interest rates, "there's no reason to have public loans." The 
Special Banks Division thus seems to be caught "on the horns of 
a dilemma," wedged in between these critics and the fiscal 
authorities who decide the interest on public investments. As 
fiscal system reform moves forward, the place of public loans 
will also be under reconsideration. That seems to put the role 
of the Special Banks Division at a strange crossroad in time.

  [Text] MOF Banking Bureau/Small Banks Division--Back 
Stage Maneuverings in Troubled Times 
  During the past several years, the financial sector has been 
shaken by a series of events--the dissolution of Toyo Credit 
Bank, the liquidation of Kamaishi Credit Bank, to name just two. 
Many nonbanks have also undergone management restructuring. 
According to a Ministry of Finance official, "In each of these 
cases, the private financial institution has accepted the 
principle of self-responsibility and have dealt with the problem 
on their own initiative." Among the majority of those closely 
involved in such incidents, however, the consensus seems to be 
that the Small Banks Division played a very strong role. 
  To the degree that strong management skills are needed for 
such a job, the division chief's position is commonly said to be 
one of the ministry's more difficult posts. Historically, it 
seems to have been the place where high-achievers with a lot of 
experience behind them in the Budget Bureau have come to test 
their financial skills. Like his predecessors, the current 
division chief, Atsuo Saka (Class of 1970), has the reputation 
for being an achiever and is also one of those who have come out 
of the Budget Bureau. He has also worked in the office of the 
Private Secretary to the Minister of Finance. 
  The Small Banks Division supervises regional banks, credit 
unions, and credit cooperatives. Regional fiscal authorities and 
prefectures have direct supervisory jurisdiction over the credit 
unions and cooperatives, but the Small Banks Division also has a 
detailed grasp of their operations, including their 
profitability and management plans. Given the apparently weak 
management structures of many regional financial institutions, 
it seems that reorganization will continue to be a problem for 
awhile, and the division can expect to receive an increasing 
number of calls for consultation. 
  Nonbanks, which have an outstanding loan balance totaling 
100 
trillion yen, are supervised by the Financial Companies Office. 
The Ministry of Finance lacks the same supervisory authority it 
has by commercial statute over nonbanks as it exercises over 
banks, securities firms, and life insurance companies. Because 
the real estate backed loans of the bubble period have turned 
into nonperforming assets, causing concern about the stability 
of the financial system, the ministry set up this office in July 
1992. Today, the unit has a staff of six members, who are 
responsible for matters concerning nonbanks, money-lenders, 
backed securities, prepaid cards, commodity investments, and 
special credits. 
  Office chief Takashi Matsumoto (1976) is only the second 
person to have filled the post. He has had many years experience 
working in the Budget Bureau, and was also head of the 
Department of Planning and Development for Kumamoto Prefecture. 
Among other things, he is currently studying how to increase the 
liquidity of interest-exempt assets, which are used by 
special-objective firms. 
<H5>  [4 Mar 94 p 2] </H5>
  [Text] MOF Banking Bureau/Research Division--Fiscal 
Administration's Think Tank' 
  It was the Research and Investigation Division that handled 
the desk work for the Financial System Research Committee, an 
advisory body to the minister of finance. It was the division 
that worked together with the Banking Bureau to come up with 
recommendations the idea of allowing banks and securities firms 
enter each other's turf. This idea forms one of the pillars of 
financial system reform. Its staff of eleven, though relatively 
small in size, serves as the Banking Bureau's "think tank." 
  Now that the first stage of financial reform has been 
completed, the division is tackling the task of defining the 
direction and the role of financial administration in the 
post-bubble years. The focus of their inquiry, taking into 
account the materialization of nonperforming loans and the 
failure of a succession of financial institutions, asks how such 
problems might be controlled and eliminated in the future. Last 
autumn, the division formed the Commission to Investigate Basic 
Problems, a subgroup under the Financial System Research 
Committee, which it has now begun deliberations. 
  In January 1994 several commission members, including 
Tetsuro 
Nishizaki (an international management consultant), and Research 
Division Chief Toshio Muraki (Class of 1972), went abroad on a 
two-week study tour, visiting the United States, England, 
France, and Germany to study financial administration in each of 
these four countries. They are planning to put together their 
findings sometime around June [1994], indicating the future 
direction for financial administration as it pertains to Japan. 
  According to Muraki, "While businesses and service fields 
are 
being deregulated, there are tougher regulations now on the 
level of government supervision." In his opinion, the trend is 
toward tougher administrative regulation. 
  The division also serves as staff for the Commission to 
Investigate Basic Problems, as well as the desk work for a task 
force working on disclosure and a special committee on 
electronic banking (EB). The disclosure task force reconvened at 
the end of March [1994] to begin an inquiry into what kind of 
information is needed to to reflect off-balance transactions. In 
the EB committee, members will be looking into regulations 
regarding electronic transactions by financial institutions. 
  The ways things stand, securities firms, through their 
subsidiary companies, may enter areas that were exclusively the 
domain of banks before. From this summer [1994], however, the 
division will be reconsidering some areas, including matters 
such as the "fire wall" [banning exchanges of information about 
customers] between parent and subsidiary companies and limits to 
the type of business or services subsidiary companies may engage 
in. 
  The head position in the Research Division, often filled by 
young men on a seniority basis, has become another "gateway to 
success" within the Banking Bureau. One of those who passed 
through this gateway is Masaaki Tsuchida (1959), who after 
becoming Banking Bureau chief, went on to head the National Tax 
Administration Agency.

  [Text] MOF Banking Bureau's Insurance 
Department/First Insurance Divivion--Change Urgent for Life 
Insurance Guidance Under Adverse Trend 
  Management of the insurance companies is facing a 
crossroads. 
While fund operations is become increasingly difficult in view 
of the historically low interest rates, participation by 
individuals has stalemated and earnings opportunities are 
declining. At the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks which 
ended in a rupture, the opening of Japan's insurance market 
became an debating point. 
  Even Satoshi Nishikawa (MOF class of 1971), who was 
transferred from director of the Second Insurance Division with 
jurisdiction over casualty insurance companies to director of 
the First Insurance Division in charge of life insurance 
companies and is well-versed in both life and casualty 
insurance, says: "No one could possibly predict such changes." 
The mainstay and small and medium life insurance companies are 
faced with the consequences of a sharp decline in hidden stock 
profits and the high yield in mass volume during the bubble 
economy, and business operations have deteriorated markedly. 
Director Nishikawa calls for an awareness reform among managers, 
saying: "In the future, management premised on improved earnings 
will not be possible." 
  In addition to granting business licenses to life insurance 
companies, the First Insurance Division issues permits for new 
commodities and services. It also periodically checks 
operational content and provides guidance on fair methods for 
the use of assets and accounting processes. Given the complex 
and specialized knowhow necessary for insurance computation to 
determine premiums, two "accountant officials" are assigned to 
the division. 
  A momentous task of insurance system reform awaits the 
insurance industry. The core consists of approving mutual entry 
between banks and securities through insurance company 
subsidiaries, and combined business operations by the main life 
and casualty insurance companies in the three areas of injury, 
disease, and nursing-care, in addition to deregulation formulas 
to determine insurance premium rates. In July 1993, a research 
office was established within the Insurance Division to perform 
the enormous task of completely revising the Insurance Industry 
Law written in the "katakana" syllabary. A revision bill is 
scheduled for submission to the ordinary Diet session in 1995. 
  Kimio Yamaguchi (class of 1967), director of the Insurance 
Department, has served in principal the MOF posts including 
budget examiner in charge of Agriculture and Forestry and 
director of the MOF Secretariat's Audit and Planning Division. 
Although this is his first assignment in the Insurance 
Department, he is evaluated highly for his sound management.

  [Text] MOF Banking Bureau's Insurance 
Department/Second Insurance Division--In the Forefront of 
Casualty Insurance Management and General Consultation 
  The six months from last fall to February 1994 was an 
unusually busy period for the Second Insurance Division of 
Insurance Department, Banking Bureau. The insurance talks at the 
Japan-U.S. economic framework conference, centering on the 
Second Insurance Division, eventually ended in a "rupture" at 
the Japan-U.S. summit on 11 February [1994]. However, Director 
Toyomi Takimoto (MOF class of 1972) who was in the forefront 
appears disappointed about the breakdown in negotiations, 
saying: "Except for the numerical targets, it was generally 
possible to reach an agreement." 
  The Second Insurance Division is in charge of guidance and 
supervision of the casualty insurance industry. Concretely, its 
main duties consist of licensing casualty insurance businesses, 
approving insurance commodities, and overseeing assets operation 
and accounting procedures by casualty insurance companies. 
Liaison with companies is indispensable, and responsible MOF 
officials constantly visit officials of the Second Insurance 
Division. 
  The Second Insurance Division has stood in the forefront of 
the First Division which handles life insurance whenever 
framework talks are held because the United States has presented 
priority demands for expansion of entry by foreign companies 
into the field of casualty insurance. For example, it has 
demanded introduction of the "broker system" which will have a 
major impact on casualty insurance companies. Director Takimoto 
and his aides have found it necessary to travel to the United 
States almost monthly since September and to spend virtually all 
their energies in overall discussions. 
  From Japan's standpoint, there are many "unreasonable" 
points 
in the U.S. demands. For example, 12 states have not inducted 
the broker system in the United States. Also, regarding cancer 
insurance which is dominated by U.S. insurance companies, it 
seeks to defer discussion of liberalization of the so-called 
"third area." The situation was reportedly one of "saying 
whatever one pleases." 
  However, many portions in the U.S. demands overlap with the 
insurance system reform currently under study by the Japanese 
side. The Second Division director expects a future reopening of 
negotiations and says: "Understanding by the U.S. side will 
definitely be won through steady progress toward system reform." 
  The overall discussions on insurance system reform has 
somewhat delayed due partly to a shortage of time. The zeal of 
casualty insurance companies has reportedly cooled down due to 
the burst of the bubble economy. Much is expected of the prowess 
of Director Takimoto who was present during the financial system 
reforms as a councilor of the Cabinet Legislative Bureau.

  [Text] MOF Minister's Secretariat/Research and 
Planning Division--Dual Role of "Brain" and Policymaking 
  The Research and Planning Division has two aspects. One is 
the role of an economist group that performs analyses of the 
economic situation as an MOF think-tank. Its other role is in 
serving as hands and feet of deputy vice minister for policy 
coordination and drafting the government's economic policies. 
  The government's economic policies were undertaken twice by 
the Research and Planning Division since Tadashi Iwashita (MOF 
class of 1970) became director: once in September 1993 and once 
in February 1994. Drafting the government's economic policies is 
responsibility of the Economic Planning Agency [EPA]. However, 
because public works investment is centered on economic stimulus 
measure such as expanded government spending and tax reduction, 
the MOF ultimately becomes the center of policymaking. 
  The Research and Planning Division serves as the window in 
consultations with other ministries and agencies. It is also the 
division's duty to persuade the other divisions within the MOF 
and to draft economic measures as centerpieces of the MOF. It is 
often caught in a dilemma between the other agencies and the MOF 
bureaus. Regarding the general economic measures in February 
when deregulation was one of the centerpieces, an executive of 
the Research and Planning Division was seen complaining: "It was 
very difficult to find an effective deregulation measure." 
  In economic policies, monetary measures form the other wheel 
of the cart with fiscal measures. It is also the Research and 
Planning Division that is consulted by the MOF as its window 
when the Bank of Japan [BOJ] raises or lowers official discount 
rate. Therefore, it constantly exchanges views with the BOJ on 
the economic situation. 
  Researching and analyzing the economic situation is also an 
important task of the division. It utilizes the MOF's unique 
data and other statistics to perform independent analyses such 
as analyzing the detailed quarterly corporate statistics 
surveyed by the Research and Statistics Department of the 
Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy within the MOF. 
  In addition to about 10 analysts who conduct survey on 
economic trends, there are specialists who are in charge of 
commodity prices, money supply, and employment following in 
detail the indicator trends and backgrounds in their specific 
fields. 
  As a division that drafts policies, elite officials have 
successively served as its director. Among former officials 
include Yoshihiko Yoshino (MOF class of 1953), governor of the 
Japan Development Bank, who also served as administrative vice 
minister and Toshio Osu (MOF class of 1959), director of BOJ, 
who served as director of the Financial Bureau. Among the 
current directors, Masami Ishizaka (class of 1963), director of 
Financial Bureau, and Takatoshi Kato (MOF class of 1964), 
director of International Finance Bureau, have served as head of 
the Research and Planning Division.

  [Text] MOF Secretariat's Financial Inspection 
Department/Control Division--Checking Problems of Travel and 
Operations 
  "Out on business trips two-thirds of the year." The lengthy 
period of business trips for inspectors in the Financial 
Inspection Department of the Minister's Secretariat who inspect 
operations of financial institutions is unparalled within the 
MOF. Trips to inspect regional banks outside of the capital 
(Tokyo) region sometimes last more than a month each. There is 
no impressive layout of policy nor is the work easy. However, 
the department is truly a pillar of financial administration. 
  The Inspection Department was moved from the Banking Bureau 
to the Minister's Secretariat in July 1992. Following the 
exposure of the so-called securities scandals involving 
compensation of huge losses by securities companies, the MOF's 
posture was also questioned. Before that, the need for 
independence of the inspection sectors located within the 
Banking Bureau and the Securities Bureau respectively was 
pointed out. The reason was that "unclear" aspects existed such 
as the internal toleration of unsound trading pointed out by the 
inspection sectors. 
  As a result, the sector for inspection of securities and 
exchange became independent as the Securities and Exchange 
Surveillance Commission-- an external bureau of the MOF, while 
the Inspection Department of the Banking Bureau and the sector 
for inspection of operational problems within the Inspection 
Division of the Inspection Bureau were merged and moved to the 
Secretariat. 
  The Banking Inspection Department is divided into the 
Control 
Division and the Examination Division. The Finance and 
Securities Inspectors Office exists within the Control Division, 
and finance and securities inspectors in the office conduct the 
actual inspections, with an average of five to seven inspectors 
assigned to a team. The inspectors from the main ministry cover 
city banks, long-term credit banks, trust banks, and regional 
banks including secondary regional banks, in addition to 
large-scale securities companies. The credit associations and 
small-scale securities companies are inspected by the Financial 
Bureaus in the respective regions. 
  The Control Division is also in charge of general affairs of 
the Banking Inspection Department and sets up inspection plans 
such as deciding the order of inspections of financial 
institutions. On the other hand, the Examination Division checks 
the post-inspection reports submitted by inspectors and the 
notifications of inspection findings to the financial 
institutions that point out items to be supplemented or 
corrected. 
  In addition to its inherent role of checking inspections, 
the 
Examination Division examines items submitted by the 
institutions for approval of tax-exempt depreciation of bad 
debts and issues depreciation certificates. The number of 
requests submitted for debt depreciation has risen sharply with 
the increase of bad debts, and the work of the division has 
expanded incomparably. Amid the progress in liberalization, the 
work of the Examination Division seems likely to change both 
qualitatively and quantitatively.

  [Text] MOF Securities Bureau/Coordination 
Division--Role of Drafting Deregulation Policy 
  The Securities Bureau accomplished its internal role of 
securities deregulation with ad hoc economic measures in 
September 1993 and supplemental deregulation measures in 
December 1993. 
  Director Akira Yamamoto (MOF class of 1969) decribes the 
division's role as "a thankless job of underpinning support." 
The scope of its precautionary support is broad and includes not 
only personnel and accounting but also general coordination 
among the bureau's divisions. Recently, it has also taken over 
the explanations given to coalition administration's Diet 
members concerning securities-related tax revisions and 
formulation of the Securities Bureau-related interpellations and 
replies with the Diet in mind. 
  The Research Office within the Coordination Division handles 
work related to finanical system reform. It performs the role of 
the Secretariat for the Securities and Exchange Council [SEC] 
and also the role of reviewing long-term problems of the 
securities and exchange system. 
  The office is currently undertaking revision of the 
Securities and Exchange Law, concerning "report on the 
improvement of a securities system in conjunction with 
deregulation of the acquisition of own-company stocks" the SEC 
issued in February 1994. 
  The deregulation of own-company stock acquisition is "aimed 
toward increasing options for corporate finance and enhancing 
the freedom for the securities and exchange system" (Yoshio 
Okubo, office director, MOF class of 1974). On the other hand, 
drawbacks accompanying purchases of own-company stocks such as 
insider trading are predicted. To prevent this, new rules will 
be instituted including regulation of insider trading, 
procedures for open buying, and methods for display of 
stock-acquisition information. 
  It is advancing its operations with an eye on the trend 
toward revision of the Commercial Law now in progress by the 
Justice Ministry. With smooth sailing, the revised law should be 
enacted in the current Diet session and the new system shoud 
start by the spring of 1995. 
  A major event will also take place this year. Annual general 
meeting of the IOSCO [International Organization of Securities 
Commissions] will be held in Asia (Tokyo) for the first time in 
October 1994. A Preparation Office was also installed within the 
division early this year. Representatives of some 100 
organizations from about 60 nations will come to Japan. Expected 
to take place on an unprecedented large scale, planning official 
Tadashi Kamimura (MOF class of 1977) and his secretarial staff 
will be extremely busy.

  [Text] MOF Securities Bureau/Securities Market 
Division--Building an Environment for Issue and Secondary Markets 
  In July 1992 with the reexamination of securities 
administration sparked by securities scandals as a turning 
point, the "Secondary Market Division" and the "Capital Market 
Division" were merged and inaugurated. The principal roles 
include overseeing the "issue" and "distribution" of securities, 
promoting a sound environment including the legal aspect of fair 
and efficient market operations and seeking revitalization of 
the market. 
  One example is last year's reopening of the market-price 
issue of stocks and public subscription of capital increases. 
Being suspended since April 1990, capital procurement through 
the stock market, which is the representative function of the 
capital market, had stopped; however, Director Takashi Fujiwara 
(MOF class of 1972) says: "We could not leave the conditions as 
they were; therefore, we improved the environment to enable 
resumption of blue chips that are attractive for investment and 
could lead to revitalization of the stock market." This month, 
capital for Japan's jumbo DPE [express delivery services] was 
increased as a first case, and concrete moves are expected to 
continue in the future. 
  Meanwhile, the Public and Corporate Bond Market Office 
within 
the division will conduct reexamination and abolition of 
existing regulations and practices concerning the issue and 
distribution of public and corporate bonds, and promote market 
improvement. 
  Although the importance of corporate bond issues as a fund 
procurement means for the companies has increased, the ratio of 
corporate bonds in the market distribution is still low compared 
to national bonds. Therefore, efforts are made to attempt 
"improvement of the secondary market in order to diversify 
capital procurement means" (Director Kenjiro Suzuki, who entered 
the MOF in 1974). 
  In a recent case, a step was taken in April 1993 to ease the 
"optimum bond criteria" that must be met when issuing corporate 
bonds. The removal of the ban on the issue of five-year 
corporate bonds in September 1993 as a deregulatory step may be 
seen as an example. Since November, a total of four companies 
have made offerings. In October 1993, the environment improved 
with the removal of the limit on corporate bond issues under the 
revised Corporate Bond Law.

  [Text] MOF Securities Bureau/Corporation Finance 
Division--Improving Rules for Disclosure Information 
  The importance of disclosing corporate information is 
strongly stressed. The reason is that, in order to bring back 
and protect the investors who have left the stock market, it is 
necessary to accurately inform them of the risks that face the 
issuing companies. The Corporation Finance Division of the 
Securities Bureau is in charge of matters concerning disclosure, 
such as the formulation of rules for disclosure. 
  The division's Planning Office is in charge of managing the 
Corporate Accounting Council, which is an advisory organ to the 
finance minister. The council drafted a report in June 1993 to 
seek better disclosure of leased property. In the future, the 
focus will be on reexamination of foreign currency-denominated 
trading and off-balance (extra-ledger) trading. 
  The division also serves as the window for the Japanese 
Government's formulation of "international accounting 
standards." The standards are set by the International 
Accounting Standards Committee, which is a group of accountant 
organizations from various nations. Given the deep interest 
among the companies that procure capital in overseas markets, 
high expectation is held toward the division's coordinating 
capability. 
  Concurrently, the division provides listings of companies to 
the nation's stock exchanges and checks the financial and 
accounting contents of the companies listed over-the-counter at 
the Securities Industry Association based on securities and bond 
reports. If window-dressing settlements and unclear account 
manipulations are discovered, the companies will be asked to 
correct them and will be reported to the Securities and Exchange 
Surveillance Commission which has prosecuting authority. 
  The audit corporate industry--the watchdog group of 
corporate 
finance--also has a supervisory role. It conducts qualification 
examinations for certified public accountants; names of the 
successful applicants will be posted on walls of the division's 
corridor. 
  Yoshiaki Niihara (MOF class of 1972), director of the 
Securities Bureau, is new to the bureau. He served successively 
at the embassies in Belgium, Luxemburg, and France and is 
well-versed in international finance.

  [Text] MOF Securities Bureau/Securities Companies 
Division--Responsibility of Supervising Securities Companies 
Questioned 
  Scandals involving securities companies continue to surface. 
Cosmo Securities which incurred huge losses through illegal 
"tobashi" [stock shuffling] trading was given relief through a 
merger with the Daiwa Bank in August 1993. Recently, Kankaku 
Securities incurred losses of about 50 billion yen through 
similar stock shuffling and is expected to receive operational 
support from The Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Ltd. Demands are 
beginning to be heard concerning the supervisory responsibility 
of the Securities Companies Division of the Securities Bureau 
which controls securities companies. 
  The Securities Companies Division has a major impact on the 
securities industry. Ever since the securities industry moved 
from the notification system to the licensing system during the 
1965 recession, the division has checked the operations of 
companies through licensing as its weapon. In case a securities 
company creates a scandal, it is the Securities Companies 
Division that determines the content of punitive measures. The 
Kankaku Securities Company's stock shuffling case was handled by 
Director Akihiko Matsutani (MOF class of 1970) who interrogated 
President Yoichiro Kato, and the activities of the Business 
Department at its corporate headquarters was suspended for two 
weeks. 
  The division is waging a heated debate with the Banking 
Bureau over reform of the financial system. In particular, it 
argued for the interests of the securities industry in 
connection with participation by city banks in the securities 
business and strongly proposed gradual participation. However, 
simultaneous entry by the top city banks was decided, and the 
division was forced to compromise broadly with the Banking 
Bureau. 
  The position of the Securities Companies Division director 
is 
a key post within the MOF. It is considered to be second only to 
the Coordination Division director within the Securities Bureau. 
Current Director Matsutani has served for many years in the 
budget field and has proved his capability. 
  The Investment Control Office was established within the 
Securities Companies Division in 1987 to specialize in 
supervising rapidly growing investment trusts and investment 
advisers. 
  The Investment Trust Research Society was started in 
November 
1993, with the Investment Control Office serving as its 
secretariat. It seeks out problems in Japan's investment trust 
system which has remained virtually unchanged since 1951 and 
considers measures for its improvement. Its goal is to compile a 
report by June, and Director Sumiharu Kusu (MOF class of 1975) 
and his staff are busy in preparation. 
<H5>  [24 Mar 94 p 2] </H5>
  [Text] Securities and Exchange Surveillance 
Commission--Gradual Buildup of Achievements and Staff 
  Apart from the MOF which has devoted itself to protecting 
and 
nurturing the securities industry, there is the "watchdog of the 
securities market" which oversees securities companies and the 
markets. Instituted in July 1992, the commission has gradually 
achieved results within a year and eight months or so including 
the criminal indictment case of the Japan Unisys stock 
manipulation and the recommendation of punishment in nine cases 
by securities companies. 
  The chairman is Toshihiro Mizuhara, former superintendent of 
the Nagoya High Public Prosecutor's Office with commissioners 
Masaji Narita and Hidetaka Mihara serving under him. The 
secretariat consists of Director Shigemitsu Sugizaki (MOF class 
of 1964) and 84 members. It is a mixed group that hails from the 
National Tax Administration Agency, the Japan Fair Trade 
Commission, the Board of Audit, the Public Prosecutor's Office, 
the courts, and the National Police Agency. The members total 
about 200 with inspectors of securities and exchange from the 
Regional Financial Bureaus included. 
  Under the secretariat are two divisions: the Coordination 
and 
Inspection Division and the Special Investigation Division. The 
Coordination and Inspection Division headed by Director Sei 
Nakai (MOF class of 1968) is divided into the inspection sector 
which inspects securities companies, the exchange sector in 
charge of watching the market and the coordination sector which 
handles office affairs. 
  The Special Inspection Division consisting of Director Hisao 
Tateishi (MOF class of 1971) and 25 staff members are in charge 
of inspecting illegal activities such as stock manipulation on 
the basis of the Securities and Exchange Law. It does not have 
authority for summary arrest but is authorized to conduct 
compulsory inspection as necessary including search and 
confiscation. 
  In the past, in addition to conducting compulsory inspection 
and indictment in connection with the Japan Unisys stock 
manipulation case, it has conducted compulsory inspection of the 
bankrupt educational publishing company "Aipech" [as 
transliterated] late last year on suspicion of window- dressing 
settlement. 
  Compared to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
[SEC] 
with its powerful authority, Japan's personnel is a mere 
one-thirteenth, and there are calls for a stronger organization. 
  In addition to approving an increase of two staffers in the 
FY94 budget, efforts are made to improve the organization by 
sending its members to the U.S. SEC for training. 
<H5>  [25 Mar 94 p 2] </H5>
  [Text] MOF Financial Bureau/First and Second Capital 
Divisions--Sole Control of Financial Investment Capital 
  Financial investment and loans constitute what is called the 
"second budget." The First Capital Division and the Second 
Capital Division are in sole control, ranging from the 
"entrance" of capital such as postal savings to the "exit" where 
loans are made to public corporations such as the Japan 
Development Bank and the National Finance Corporation. Staffers 
say: "There are two divisions, but we are one capital family." 
  The First Division is the staff headquarters so to speak. It 
is in charge of not only planning and drafting financial 
investment programs for each fiscal year but also watches the 
trends in postal savings and pension problems at the "entrance" 
and government-related financial institutions at the "exit." 
  On the other hand, excluding the Japan Development Bank and 
the Export-Import Bank of Japan which are handled by the First 
Division, the Second Division is a frontline corps that 
supervises 50-odd lenders individually. 
  Attention on financial investment has recently mounted 
sharply. Amid the severe financial circumstances in the general 
account, many housing measures and small-and-medium business 
measures have utilized financial investment in the continuing 
business stimulating decisions during the past two years. The 
function of financial investment called business adjustment is 
operating fully during the prolonged recession. 
  On the other hand, there are also dilemmas. The funds of the 
Fund Operation Department which supplies original capital for 
financial investment are entrusted to it by the people, and 
surety of redemption is demanded of their use. 
  At the end of 1993, the coalition ruling parties proposed a 
concept of establishing a loan-purchase organization which uses 
financial investment funds to promote processing of bad debts by 
financial institutions. However, Director Fumio Inui (MOF class 
of 1970) of the First Division pointed out the principle of 
financial investment, and asked: "What would you do if the funds 
become frozen?" The proposal was deferred. 
  Pressures for "reliance on financial investment" continue to 
grow, but since difficulty in advancing funds is beginning to 
surface, a debate on the direction of financial investment is 
likely to flare up. 
  First Division Director Inui, "boss" of the "single capital 
family" who works in a large room without compartments, served 
for many years in the Budget Bureau and also in the Taxation and 
Financial Bureaus. He is therefore well-versed in finance. 
Second Division Director Yuzo Harada (MOF class of 1972) who 
oversees individual lenders has served chiefly in the field of 
international finance. The two are working in tandem on 
financial investment which faces a crossroads.

  [Text] MOF Financial Bureau/Government Debt 
Division--"Keystone" of National Bond Management Policy 
  Widening apprehension that the rise of long-term interest 
rates is deterring a business recovery. Early this year, the 
circulation yield on national bond index issues temporarily rose 
to the 4-percent level, exceeding the usual early-year rises by 
1 percent. Providing the backdrop for the rise in interest rates 
is the fear of deteriorating supply-demand in the bond market 
due to increasing issues of national bonds. Given the volatile 
business trend, attention is drawn to the trend in the 
Government Debt Division as the keystone of national bond 
management policy. 
  With a decline in tax revenues and the continuing 
implementation of economic measures, the national bond issue 
balance is expected to exceed 200 trillion yen at the end of 
FY94. Director Shokichi Takagi (MOF class of 1971) emphasizes 
following a natural course, saying: "We will merely digest them 
with stability by adapting a planned volume to market 
conditions." Regarding interest rates, he points out the 
difficulty of reading the financial market, saying: "A variety 
of economic factors reflect on them." 
  Within the Government Debt Division is a separate room with 
a 
transparent wall. The director and his staff meet there with 
representatives from banks and securities companies or talk with 
them over the phone to exchange views on schedules for national 
bond bidding and market conditions. When it is time to bid or 
submit tenders, reporters from the news agencies are seen going 
in and out of the division and reporting the prices. Given the 
close daily relations with the financial market, the busy 
activities of the division are conspicuous within the Financial 
Bureau. 
  In addition, the division handles accounting of national 
obligations including the special account and watches for 
counterfeit national bonds. 
  Takagi served successively as assistant division director in 
the National Property Coordination Division, the First Capital 
Division, and the Second Capital Division and is well-versed in 
the affairs of the Financial Bureau. When he was director of the 
Securities Market Division, he solved the problem of 
liberalizing fees for stock sales and purchases, and therefore, 
he is knowledgeable in securities affairs. Masanori Totsuka, 
government debt auditor (class of 1962), is in charge of the 
government debt consolidation fund special account which 
controls the redemption sources for national bonds.

  [Text] MOF International Finance Bureau/Coordination 
Division--No Time To Relax With Numerous Unexpected Cases 
  The Foreign Exchange Bureau of the MOF was changed to the 
International Finance Bureau in 1964 when Japan completed its 
transition as a nation under Article 8 of the IMF and became a 
member of the OECD. Subsequently, with the internationalization 
of finance, the bureau's importance rose rapidly. Its personnel 
of 136 surpassed the Banking Bureau (128) and the Securities 
Bureau (84). The Coordination Division manages and supports the 
large personnel. 
  The duties of the International Finance Bureau are widely 
diversified. They range from stabilization of foreign exchange 
to overseeing the international finance and capital market, 
compilation of international balance statistics, coping with 
cumulative debt problems, and economic aid to the developing 
nations. 
  It is the difficult task of the Coordination Division as the 
general coordinating sector to implement these parallel duties 
simultaneously. It often faces with unexpected cases that are 
impacted by changes in the international situation such as the 
suspicion of nuclear development in the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea [North Korea], and there is no time to relax 
throughout the year. Another source of headaches is the 
inability to rest on weekends when international conferences 
converge. 
  The post of director of the Coordination Division increases 
in importance as the "ranking" of the MOF's International 
Finance Bureau rises. In many cases, a future candidate for the 
bureau director--often a candidate for finance secretary which 
is treated as a deputy minister-class post--is assigned. Current 
Division Director Norimichi Kawai (MOF class of 1969) served 
successively as director of the International Organizations 
Division, director of the Foreign Exchange Fund Division and 
director of the Development Policy Division, which are the 
principal divisions within the International Finance Bureau, and 
he is highly experienced. 
  The International Coordination Office was established within 
the Coordination Division in July 1993 as a sector specializing 
in bilateral negotiations on finance. At present virtually all 
of its duties are concentrated on negotiations with the United 
States including the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The 
discussions have been suspended after the Japan-U.S. summit 
talks ruptured in February [1994]. Since September 1993, Daisuke 
Kotegawa (class of 1975), office director, and his staff who 
continued coordination efforts for days and nights are presently 
"recharging their batteries."

  [Text] MOF International Banking 
Division--Coordinator Between Japanese Banks and Foreign 
Governments 
  The posture of Japanese banks vis-a-vis international 
banking 
has changed considerably during the past decade. It is 
particularly true concerning exchange with the developing 
nations. Since the mid-1980's, banks have devoted themselves to 
debt recovery due to the rise of cumulative debt problems. 
However, with marked economic growth in Asia from the early 
1990's, they have shown a stance of aggressive advancement into 
the region. Recently, they have been focusing on Central and 
South America which are the "central sources" of debt problems. 
The International Banking Division serves as the coordinator 
between the Japanese banks which are eager to advance overseas 
and the foreign governments. 
  The Foreign Exchange Law stipulates general capital 
exchanges 
with foreign countries as the supervisory scope of the division. 
Consequently, the division is visited by the officers in charge 
not only from banks but also from securities companies and 
general trading companies. Its recent duties, however, consist 
predominantly of works related to the advance into Asia by 
Japanese banks. 
  The Asian strategy among Japanese banks focuses not only on 
Hong Kong and Singapore where branches have been previously 
established, but it also focuses on full-fledged advancement 
into Thailand, Malaysia, and China. Some city banks want to "be 
allowed to establish branches ahead of their competitors and to 
use that advantage toward concrete results" (a bank executive). 
  Director Yukio Yoshimura (MOF class of 1970) who served in 
the embassies abroad for many years is a leading 
internationalist within the bureau. In his previous post as 
director of the International Organizations Division, he 
traveled to numerous countries to attend such international 
conferences as the IMF and the G-7 finance ministers and central 
bank governors conference. Even such internationalist as 
Director Yoshimura, his views on the somewhat overheated 
eagerness of the banks to advance into Asia are calm and points 
out "a need to pay more consideration to local circumstances." 
  In the International Banking Division, the study of 
derivatives such as swaps and options has surfaced as a new 
task. The reason is that a sharp rise is seen in international 
derivatives trading. The offices that were formerly handled 
inspection of loans by Japanese banks to the developing nations 
have recently been engaged in the study of derivatives products.

  [Text] MOF International Finance 
Bureau/International Organizations Division--The Hub of the IMF 
and International Conferences 
  A clock showing the times in Washington and Paris hangs on 
the wall in the large room. On the desks are piles of documents 
written in English. English is constantly heard throughout the 
division and fax messages are exchanged with various stations. 
While serving as Japan's window at the IMF, the division is the 
secretariat for the MOF at international conferences such as the 
G-7 finance ministers and central bank governors conference held 
in February and the APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation] 
conference in March [1994]. The division personnel totals 13, 
but "they accompany the minister and finance secretaries, and 
someone is always on a trip overseas" (Director Shigeo Kashiwagi 
(MOF class of 1973). The sector is directly linked to the 
"international stage." 
  The division was originally established with jurisdication 
over the international monetary system with its central role as 
a window to the IMF and the OECD. Following the transition to a 
floating rate system in 1973, the importance of policy 
cooperation among the advanced nations in economic operations 
rose and its role as a conference secretariat expanded 
correspondingly. 
  Amid rising expectations and hopes in Japan toward recovery 
of the global economy, the staff members are busy preparing for 
the G-7/IMF provisional committee meeting which is scheduled for 
late April [1994]. It will be followed successively by the OECD 
ministerial directors meeting in June and the Naples summit in 
July. Unlike the schedule of busy preoccupation with the budget 
from summer until the yearend with a respite in early spring, 
the division will face its "real grind" from here on. 
  It occupies a pivotal position between the overseas offices 
and Japan concerning the IMF. It conducts endless liaison with 
the Japanese director's office in Washington on items on the 
agenda of the directors meetings held three times weekly at IMF 
headquarters. It transmits data overseas on how to present 
Japan's position regarding problems of the global economy and a 
variety of problems on relations between Japan and the advanced 
and developing nations. 
  Director Kashiwagi who has been assigned to the IMF as an 
economist stresses the need for personnel contribution 
commensurate with an economic power when he says: "Of the 
approximately 2,200 staffers at the IMF headquarters, there are 
only about 10 Japanese excluding those on assignment from the 
MOF. This number is far too few."

  [Text] MOF International Finance Bureau/Research 
Division--Role To Prepare International Balance of Payments 
  The External Economic Reform Outline decided by 
the government at the end of March [1994] clearly indicates the 
government forecast that the FY94 current account surplus will 
show a GDP [gross domestic product] of about 2.8 percent. 
Furthermore, it presents its goal of "a significant reduction in 
the mid-term current account surplus." Providing the backdrop 
for the government's determination toward surplus reduction is 
the reality that Japan's surplus in 1993 exceeded $130 billion, 
reaching the highest level in history. The International Finance 
Bureau's Research Division prepares statistical bulletins on the 
international balance of payments every month and makes public 
Japan's current account surplus which is the focus of attention 
at home and abroad. 
  Every year, the Research Division prepares the international 
balance portion of the government's economic forecast while 
consulting with the Audit and Planning Division of the 
Minister's Secretariat and the EPA [Economic Planning Agency], 
parallel with the formulation of the budget draft. The current 
account surplus in the FY94 forecast is expected to be about 
13.8 trillion yen, or a drop of 600 billion yen from the 
previous fiscal year. 
  The Research Division also serves as the secretariat for the 
Foreign Exchange Council which is an advisory organ for the MOF 
and MITI ministers. In June 1993 the council prepared a report 
seeking stronger risk controls over such derivatives as swaps 
and options in view of expanding exchange in the international 
financial markets. This fiscal year, it is conducting research 
on the theme of how international financial exchange is being 
conducted in the public and private sectors. 
  Another important duty of the Research Division is to 
ascertain principal economic indicators of the various nations 
and to manage their data. 
  Comments made by Director Hiroshi Uchimura (class of 1974) 
during the announcement of international balance of payments 
attract the attention of market-related quarters as representing 
the Japanese Government's view concerning the surplus problem. 
Consequently, on the eve of the announcement, the division is 
busy checking figures and drafting statements. Kazuko Tanaka 
(class of 1966), an expert on international balance of payments, 
is responsible for reexamining computation methods for the 
balance of payments. It is conducted as a response to the IMF's 
revision of the criteria for submission of international balance 
of payment reports.

  [Text] MOF Foreign Exchange and Money Market Division 
and International Capital Division--Determining Pros and Cons of 
Market Intervention 
  The Foreign Exchange and Money Market Division is the MOF's 
"dealing room" with rows of terminals that report the trends in 
the foreign exchange market. Its role is to decide the direction 
of market intervention while keeping an eye on trends in the 
exchange market. Because of the development of the high yen 
since last year, calls for moves by the division have increased. 
It is the window to the Bank of Japan [BOJ]'s International 
Bureau and is filled with tension particularly during the 
business hours of the Tokyo market. 
  In tense situations, it watches the market from dawn to late 
in the night and instructs the BOJ to intervene if necessary. 
The Foreign Exchange and Money Market Division controls the 
Foreign Exchange Capital Control Special Account which supplies 
intervention funds. When the BOJ intervenes in yen sales and 
dollar purchases, payments are made from this account. However, 
Director Nobuhiko Kawakami (MOF class of 1971) says: "Alsolutely 
no comment on intervention," and the realities are wrapped in 
secrecy. 
  Nonetheless, there was a surplus payment of 3.83 trillion 
yen 
from the account in FY93. It was the second largest overpayment 
after FY86 and indicates the second largest scale of 
intervention since the Februry 87 Louvre Accord which took place 
last fiscal year. Director Kawakami, who transferred to his 
present post from director of the International Finance Bureau's 
Development Finance Division in July 1992, sounds edgy 
concerning his fight againt the high yen when he says: "The 
continuing situation does not permit one to relax." 
  The International Capital Division is in charge of internal 
and external capital exchange. Whenever companies issue foreign 
bonds or when foreign governments and companies issue 
yen-denominated bonds directed toward Japan's investors, a 
notification to the MOF is required, and the division serves as 
the window. Director Toru Nio (class of 1972) says: "Our task is 
to maintain a balance between capital flow and deregulation in 
tune with the international environment." 
  Regarding deregulation, in January 1994 the division set 
forth a measure to ease the qualifying criteria for foreign 
bonds issued by the companies and yen-denominated foreign bonds 
issued by foreign companies. It has held discussions with 
market-related groups on yen-denominated foreign bonds since 
early this year and is studying measures to revitalize the 
market including its marketability.

  [Text] MOF International Finance Bureau/Third 
Development Division--Role in Reducing Surplus Through Capital 
Reflux 
  Japan-U.S. relations are deteriorating over Japan's huge 
current account surplus. Attention is focused on an overlay of 
Japan's public works investment and an expansion of domestic 
demand as breakthrough measures, but actually capital reflux 
measures by Japan play a large role in reducing the surplus. The 
MOF International Finance Bureau's "three development 
divisions"--the Development Policy Division, the Development 
Institutions Division, and the Development Finance Division--may 
be regarded as the practical business corps, so to speak, of 
such capital reflux measures. 
  The Development Policy Division which controls the 
bilateral-based ODA [Offical Development Assistance] maintains 
indispensable liaison and negotiations with MOFA [the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs], the EPA and MITI. The reason is that 
"development assistance measures cannot be implemented by a 
single ministry or agency." At summit conferences by the 
advanced nations, the problem of aid to the developing nations 
is invariably discussed, and the workload of the division rises 
steadily prior to such conferences. 
  The Development Policy Division's important task consists of 
putting the support framework and methods into concrete form. It 
is also in charge of solving the debt problems of the cumulative 
debtor nations thus braodening the scope of its jurisdictional 
duties. 
  The ODA [Official Development Assistance] provides not only 
bilateral support but also support through international 
institutions. It is overseen by the Development Institutions 
Division. The division personnel handles office procedures for 
decisionmaking by international institutions and preparations 
for annual general meetings. The division is divided into 
sections by institutions, such as the International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development [IBRD], the Asian Development 
Bank [ADB], and the United States Development Bank and provides 
thorough "background support" to enable the respective 
institutions to conduct smooth operations. 
  The International Finance Division, unlike the Policy 
Division and Institutions Division, is in charge of work related 
to individual financing problems, rather than to the policy 
aspect. A classic example is the disposition of financing cases 
by the Export-Import Bank of Japan. The majority of the bank's 
financing is cooperative financing with Japan's private banks 
and may be regarded as the most "businesslike" among the three 
divisions in terms of practical business affairs. The division 
is also in change of yen loans.
