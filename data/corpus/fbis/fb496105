<F P=106> [Interview in writing with ROK President Kim Yong-sam by </F>
Georgina Higueras in Seoul; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [Introductory passage omitted] [Higueras] Does 
North Korea have the military capability to launch a surprise 
attack against your country? 
  [Kim] Yes. It has over a million armed personnel and 
possesses conventional weapons exceeding those of South Korea. 
The North has also developed its own long-range missiles, which 
can reach not only the whole of our national territory but even 
the coasts of Japan. It must also be borne in mind that 65 
percent of its military might is concentrated near the armistice 
line. If the international community decides to apply sanctions 
against the North Korean regime, or the latter believes that it 
has no other solution in order to stay in power, its having 
recourse to the adventure of a provocation is not to be ruled 
out. Despite this, I believe that North Korea will not attack 
us, since this would cause its own destruction. 
  [Higueras] What is your opinion of what Kim Il-song said the 
other day -- that he has neither the atomic bomb nor the 
technology to construct it? 
  [Kim] If what he says is true, he must prove it. I believe 
that Kim Il-song should accept both International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) inspection and reciprocal inspection between the 
two Koreas so as to end the suspicions about nuclear weapons. 
  [Higueras] Should the United Nations intervene if Pyongyang 
persists in not allowing the inspection of its nuclear 
facilities? 
  [Kim] North Korea must take the international community's 
concern into account and comply with the IAEA's nuclear safety 
measures as soon as possible. It should also guarantee nuclear 
openness through faithful observance of the joint declaration by 
Pyongyang and Seoul on the denuclearization of the peninsula. I 
believe that if North Korea continues to reject IAEA inspection, 
the UN Security Council will adopt the appropriate measures, and 
many countries of the international community will join in that 
decision. 
  [Higueras] Do you believe that the current tension with the 
North could cause the return [to power] of the Army, which has 
ruled your country almost uninterruptedly? 
  [Kim] The Armed Forces positively support the military 
reforms which my government is implementing, and since there is 
a growing conviction among them that they themselves will suffer 
most if they intervene in politics again, I feel certain that 
the Army will not interfere in public life again. 
  [Higueras] The U.S. military presence in your country is 
increasingly opposed by young people. To what extent do you 
deem that presence necessary? 
  [Kim] Although there are some anti-American slogans among 
some young people, the majority of the South Korean people are 
aware of the importance of the U.S. troops' being stationed in 
South Korea. If we take into account the reality of the 
security of the Korean peninsula, where the Cold War is not yet 
over, the role currently played by the U.S. forces is more 
important than ever. 
  [Excerpt] [Higueras] You recently visited China. Do you 
believe that in the medium term that will be the ally which will 
replace the United States in Seoul's interests? 
  [Kim] In the economic field, relations with China are 
developing very rapidly. However, political and diplomatic 
cooperation, even on the nuclear issue, remains limited. In the 
future, there will undoubtedly be an intensive development of 
relations in all fields, which will contribute to peace and 
stability in this area of northeast Asia, but I believe that the 
United States will remain a very important country for us both 
in the medium and in the long term. 
  [Higueras] Are you in favor of the reunification of the 
Korean peninsula? 
  [Kim] The government has a firm principle laid down -- to 
carry out reunification by peaceful means in accordance with 
consultations between the South and the North -- but last March, 
during a session of inter-Korean talks, Pyongyang did not 
hesitate to address to our delegation outrageous and threatening 
remarks, such as that they would turn Seoul into a "sea of 
fire." With this, the dialogue was broken off, but if North 
Korea demonstrates its efforts to dispel the nuclear suspicions, 
relations between the South and the North could make significant 
progress. 
  [Higueras] At the beginning of your presidency, you launched 
a merciless war against the corruption inherited from the former 
regime, but this currently seems to have become bogged down. To 
what extent does corruption hamper your exercise of power? 
  [Kim] The struggle against corruption and administrative 
irregularities has achieved results which were never imagined in 
the past. I am now striving to continue and administer the work 
aimed at preventing a return of those evils, since it is not at 
all easy to uproot a system of corruption which has been rooted 
for so long in our society. Nevertheless, it is clear that, if 
I had left corruption as it was, the state's competitiveness 
would have collapsed from within. In this era of unlimited 
competition, corruption was making our survival impossible; that 
is why I am unshakeably determined to end it. 
  [Higueras] How does the GATT affect your country? 
  [Kim] The removal of the various barriers to trade, in 
accordance with the new GATT agreement, will affect South Korea 
very favorably, since it will increase our exports and diversify 
our export markets. Although certain industries whose 
competitiveness is weak will experience short-term difficulties 
as a result of the liberalization, in the medium and long term 
it will rather be advantageous for strengthening Korean 
industry's physical makeup or structure. That is, the benefits 
will be greater than the losses.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, June 1 (AFP) -- Three foreigners 
kidnapped seven weeks ago in southern Cambodia are still alive 
and have been contacted daily by the Cambodian Government, an 
official said Wednesday. 
  Information ministry spokesman Sieng Lapresse told reporters 
that the missing trio were being contacted on a daily basis 
through unspecified "sources," and that specialists were now 
working for their release. 
  He said the government had ruled out a military solution to 
the problem, but did not elaborate on the steps it was taking to 
secure their release. 
  Briton Dominic Chappel, his Australian girlfriend Kelly 
Wilkinson and a British friend, Tina Dominy, were travelling 
from the capital to the southern port town of Sihanoukville 
April 11 when their taxi was stopped by Khmer Rouge guerrillas 
and the three were ordered out into the bush. 
  Meanwhile, the Royal Palace here released a telegram 
addressed to British Prime Minister John Major Wednesday in 
which King Norodom Sihanouk said the Khmer Rouge had denied 
kidnapping the three foreigners. 
  In the telegram, the king said Khmer Rouge nominal leader 
Khieu Samphan had told him during Cambodian peace talks in 
Pyongyang on Friday that the radical faction had not been 
responsible for the abductions. 
  He added that he had appealed on radio and television to 
those responsible for the abductions to let their prisoners go 
free.

  [Text] The Australian ambassador to the Kingdom of 
Cambodia has been appointed as a (?senior) adviser to Prince 
Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut, deputy prime minister and minister of 
foreign affairs. Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said 
the appointment had been made at the request of the Royal 
Government of Cambodia [RGC]. 
  The ambassador will take up this assignment next month after 
his term as the Australian envoy comes to an end. 
  Evans further said that the nomination is (?clear) evidence 
of Australia's determination to further move forward with 
Cambodia and that the ambassador will provide useful political 
and diplomatic advice and assist in developing Cambodia's 
national (?planning). The Australian Aid Agency, he added, has 
asked for funds to hire two senior advisers to help the RGC in 
the agricultural and educational sectors.

  [Text] On 1 June, Khan Savoeun, Prince Ranariddh's 
self-appointed general and former commander of a military 
division in Stoung District of Kompong Thom Province, ordered 
aircraft to bomb and strafe Soeng and Rumchang [former bases of 
FUNCINPEC -- National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, 
Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia -- near the Thai border], 
alleging that Khmer Rouge were present. However, the bombing 
and strafing hit the wives and children of the Para soldiers 
[former non-communist resistance forces], killing or wounding a 
number of them, instead of the Democratic Kampuchean forces. 
  The Para soldiers were very angry and condemned Khan 
Savoeun, 
Prince Ranariddh, and other FUNCINPEC ringleaders, and fired 
heavily at the aircraft.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Foreign Media Love Khmer Rouge"] </F>
  [Text] "Tourist arrivals have been drastically reduced as 
a result of escalated fighting". "The Khmer Rouge are making 
further inroads into government areas". "The Royal Cambodian 
Armed Forces are demoralised after two heavy defeats". 
  These are some of the headlines on news items churned out by 
the international press. Hence, the question on everyone's lips 
is: Is Cambodia safe? Is it wise to travel to Phnom Penh? Is 
it not a dangerous place where banditry is rampant and security 
is virtually nonexistent? 
  The answer lies very much on what the media reports. In this 
case, sadly, it is the negative aspects of life in Cambodia. As 
the adage goes, it is news when man bites dog but it isn't when 
dog bites man. 
  In this Kingdom, sensationalism is the key word as far as 
most journalists are concerned. 
  Journalists, largely western and even some locals, just 
thrive on the negative aspects of news reporting. There is no 
bright side as this either is not worth the paper it is typed on 
or will not be used by the international media. 
  Each day, private business deals are being clinched, both 
with the government or with major local business houses. Road 
restoration projects are seen while some form of sanity is 
slowly but surely returning to the city. 
  Given this situation, it may seem wise for the international 
media to harp on fighting which is taking place three to four 
hundred kilometres away. 
  They give innuendos that the city itself and the Royal 
Government might come under siege as a result of recent 
battlefield victories by the recalcitrant Khmer Rouge guerilla 
faction. 
  The same incident, for example a mortar attack on Heathrow 
airport, only managed a single column in some newspapers. 
Negative news on this nation is blazed on the front page of 
newspapers, particularly in a neighbouring country. 
  However, the positive side is seldom reported or heard of. 
Week after week, press conferences at the Ministry of 
Information is often monopolised by certain journalists intent 
only on getting more details on the Khmer Rouge. 
  Questions evolve around this guerilla faction so much, it 
has 
even been said that press briefings are for an insight into the 
Khmer Rouge, not other aspects of this nation as the press 
conference is intended for. 
  For the nation to shrug off this negative image, attitudes 
must change, both within the government machinery, the public 
and in neighbouring countries. 
  If one were to recall, a neighbouring nation which had faced 
the same situation as this nation approximately 30 years ago, 
roped in the media to wage a psychological battle against the 
terrorists. 
  The media, the common people and the government were one in 
this battle. The government propaganda machinery went on the 
offensive to win the hearts and minds of the masses. 
  Negative reporting about terrorists attacks were played down 
while business, investment and government projects and 
activities were highlighted. 
  This should be a useful lesson for the Royal Government and 
the powers that are in this nation. The masses restored 
democracy with the assistance of the international community. 
  The Government owes it to the masses and with the undivided 
assistance and co-operation of the masses, it can certainly 
reverse the negative battlefield disasters and highlight the 
increasing number of businesses waiting to kick off. This would 
be the start of better things.

  [Excerpt] According to a report dated 30 May from the 
front line, the combined forces of the Royal Government have 
already reached the Chi Neang point on Route 10, 18 km east of 
Pailin. No clashes have been reported, and the government 
troops, which seem to be very vigilant at this point in time, 
have not yet overrun the area. 
  The report further says that the plateau Phnum Veng on Route 
10 near Chineang is also being surrounded by government forces. 
  A senior Army officer said the government forces' advance 
has 
not encountered any heavy attacks and that the smooth headway 
indicated that the Khmer Royal Armed Forces are on the alert and 
have never forgotten their recent shameful defeats. [passage

  [Text] According to the report received on 1 June, the 
fighting between Burmese Government troops and minority rebels 
has eased up in different parts of Burma. All encounters took 
place 50 to 70 kilometers from the Thai border, except for the 
fighting opposite Mae Sai District of Chiang Rai Province. 
  Government troops and the rebels in the vicinities of Namon 
and Hin Kong Mountains and Mong Chot Town continuously exchanged 
artillery shelling. It is believed that the new units sent to 
reinforce the government's position at the Tachilek border town 
are planning to attack the rebels now surrounding Mong Chot, 
Mong Ton, and Mong Pan Townships. 
  Kun Sa's men reportedly have set up a field hospital 
opposite 
Lak Taeng Village of Tambon Wiang Luang, Wiang Heng District, 
Chiang Mai Province. The hospital is capable of providing 
treatment for 300 patients. Meanwhile, Khun Sa has dispatched 
3,000 men from Mong Mai, opposite Mae Hong Son Province, to the 
northeastern region of the Shan State. 
  Major General Yutthana Muangmangkhang, commander of the 33d 
Military Circle in Chiang Mai Province, ordered reinforcements 
for the security force at Doi Tung Royal Villa, the residence of 
the princess mother, because the fighting between Burmese 
Government troops and rebels are not very far from the place.

  [Text] On 2 June, a minority force attacked and drove 
Burmese Government soldiers from Mong Ta. The soldiers have 
suffered several setbacks at the hands of the minority force 
since they were reinforced by the Kachin battalion No. 5 to hold 
Tachilek. 
  According to a report received on the morning of 4 June, 
more 
than three battalions of Burmese soldiers attacked and retook 
Mong Ta from the minority force. The government soldiers were 
carried by four two-engined planes, which carried out three bomb 
sorties against opposition positions from the evening of 3 June 
till the morning of the next day. 
  The bombing is the first time planes have been used against 
the minority force in the battle that began on 7 May. The 
bombing resulted in 21 minority soldiers and 42 other civilians 
killed in Mong Ta. Many homes were destroyed. There was no 
report regarding counterattacks by the minority force.

  [Text] International media, especially the Cable News 
Network [CNN], should focus its coverage on the injustice the 
Bosnian people face, instead of making false reports on the 
issue. Defense Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said the 
media should see the injustice that prevails there, namely the 
continued arms embargo faced by the Bosnians, while Serb 
terrorists continue to receive arms from Belgrade. This is the 
current injustice the Bosnians face and the media must fight 
against it. 
  The minister was speaking to reporters after he met local 
UMNO [United Malays National Organization] leaders in Johor 
Baharu today. He was commenting on a CNN report, the effect of 
which was that Malaysia had been providing arms to Bosnia. The 
minister also reiterated Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir's denial of 
the report. He said he could not understand why CNN carried the 
incorrect report. He added that 50 million ringgit has been 
allocated to upgrade military camps nationwide.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jun 6 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Cable News 
Network (CNN) of the United States has agreed to carry a denial 
of its report that Malaysia supplied arms to Bosnian Muslims, 
Information Minister Mohamed Rahmat said Sunday. 
  The television station would also contact the Malaysian 
Embassy in Washington to rectify the error, he told reporters in 
southern Johor state. 
  CNN had recently carried a report saying that Malaysia had 
supplied light weapons to the Muslim army in war-torn 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Mohamed said the government did not want to pick a quarrel 
with the CNN over the report but hoped that the western media 
including CNN would be fair and accurate in their reporting, 
particularly on Malaysia. 
  We only wanted a clarification from CNN... But they said 
they 
will carry a denial, which is very good as we want fair 
reporting, he said, adding that CNN had written to him a few 
days ago.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jun 6 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Prime 
Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said Sunday, the news fabrication 
about Malaysia supplying arms to Bosnian Muslims is probably 
aimed at preventing Malaysian forces from serving in that 
country. 
  In line with established rules, any country involved in arms 
running would be isolated and prevented from serving under the 
United Nations banner, he said. 
  It therefore looks like an attempt to isolate us, Dr. 
Mahathir told reporters when asked to comment on the news 
fabrication. 
  Dr. Mahathir said Malaysia would not do anything against the 
rules as it would be barred from serving in Bosnia where the 
services of Malaysian soldiers were very much needed. 
  He said the Bosnians were being threatened that if they did 
not accept the peace proposal of the West, they would withdraw 
their forces from there. 
  If that were to happen and Malaysian forces would also not 
be 
able to serve there then the Bosnian Muslims would be 
slaughtered and there would be no one to help them, Dr. Mahathir 
said. 
  The prime minister also reiterated Malaysia's stand that the 
arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims be lifted as they did not 
have any weapons with them. 
  Our call for the lifting of the arms embargo only applies to 
Bosnia as the people in Bosnia did not have any weapons to 
defend themselves, he said.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jun 6 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Russian first 
Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets arrived here Monday for a 
two-day official visit to Malaysia. 
  Acting Foreign Minister Abu Hassan Omar welcomed Soskovets 
at 
the airport. Deputy Defence Minister Wan Abu Bakar Mohamed is 
the minister-in-attendance. 
  Soskovets, who is accompanied by several senior officials, 
is 
here to witness the signing of a multi-billion ringgit contract 
between Malaysia and Russia for the purchase of 18 MIG-29 air 
superiority jet-fighters. The signing will take place Tuesday, 
at the Finance Ministry. 
  Soskovets is also scheduled to meet Prime Minister Dr. 
Mahathir Mohamed, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and 
Defence Minister Najib Razak. 
  He will visit the Palm Oil Research Institute of Malaysia 
(PORIM), Airod Sdn Bhd [Company Limited], the country's 
privatised aircraft inspection, repair and overhaul depot, and a 
local telecommunications firm, Sapura Holdings. 
  Malaysia will buy 18 MIG-29 aircraft, codenamed Fulcrum by 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), to beef up the 
Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) long-term air defence 
programmes. The payment for the deal is expected to be made in 
hard currency and palm oil. 
  The signing of the agreement between Malaysian and Russian 
officials, to be witnessed by Anwar, Najib and Soskovets, is the 
culmination of a year-long negotiations due to the strict 
conditions imposed by the Malaysian Government over the purchase 
of the aircraft which played a high profile during the Langkawi 
International Maritime and Aerospace (LIMA) exhibition in north- 
western peninsular, last year. 
  The RMAF will be the first in the region to fly the Fulcrum, 
the twin-engine jet-fighter manufactured by the Mikoyan Design 
Bureau, Moscow.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 6 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Russian 
scientists are keen to serve Malaysia in various fields of 
advanced technology, Minister of Science, Technology and 
Environment Law Hieng Ding said Monday. 
  The fields involved would be those in which Malaysia has 
vacancies or lacked expertise such as in bio-technology, 
information technology, electronics, advanced manufacturing and 
aerospace, he told reporters after talks with visiting Russian 
First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets. 
  Due to the good response from the Russian scientists, the 
ministry would discuss and verify their qualifications with 
their Ministry of Science before accepting them, said Law. 
Malaysian and Russian research institutions had also been 
co-operating well and six Malaysian research officers were now 
in Moscow, he said. 
  On the desludging activities of ships and tankers in the 
Straits of Malacca and the South China Sea which endangered the 
livelihood of Malaysian fishermen and spoilt the country's 
beaches, Law said his ministry had expressed its concern over 
this at the recent meeting of the commission on sustainable 
development. 
  As more than 360 vessels ply the Straits of Malacca and the 
South China Sea daily, there is an urgent need to take all 
necessary measures regarding the disposal of tanker sludge, he 
said. 
  Detailed discussions had been held with the International 
Maritime Organisation (IMO) Director William O'Neil so that IMO 
could address the problem, he said. 
  In this way, the IMO could help safeguard the interests of 
littoral states like Malaysia, Law added.

  [Excerpt] It was reported that Nhoek Bunchhai, the 
self-appointed general, the highest ranking commander of the 
FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, 
Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] group, and Prince 
Ranariddh's most able man, died in Samraong District of Oddar 
Meanchey Province on 31 May. 
  What was the cause of Nhoek Bunchhai's death, which members 
of the group have tried hard to hide? 
  The people who often travel in and out of Samraong District 
said that there are two stories concerning Nhoek Bunchhai's 
death. 
  1. As Nhoek Bunchhai went from Samraong to inspect the 
battlefield at Tonle Sar on Route 69, his armored personnel 
carrier ran over a land mine near Tonle Sar. He was killed in 
the explosion. 
  2. When Nhoek Bunchhai was on his way to inspect the 
battlefield along Route 69 west of Samraong, some forcibly 
recruited Para [former non-communist forces] soldiers from 
Prince Ranariddh's group lobbed a grenade into his armored car. 
Nhoek Bunchhai was then killed at the same time as five other 
colonels were killed or wounded. 
  These Para soldiers lobbed the grenade because, on the one 
hand, they were angry with Nhoek Bunchhai and other commanders 
who had sent their subordinates to forcibly recruit them and 
send them out to fight on the battlefield while they were busily 
striving to grow rice to be ready for the coming rainy season. 
This has caused them and their families to face famine and 
untold misery. Moreover, when these soldiers were sent to the 
battlefield, their commanders took liberties with their wives 
and children at home. 
  To the Para soldiers, this is a matter of life and death. 
[passage omitted].

  [Unattributed commentary: "Both the Khmer Rouge and Their 
Newspapers Must Be Eliminated"] 
  [Text] Both the Khmer Rouge elements and their newspapers in 
Phnom Penh have continued to claim that the government [RG] is a 
warmonger and does not want peace. Now, it has been shown 
clearly, through the roundtable meeting, who the warmongers are 
and who does and does not want peace. 
  Three planeloads of government officials went to attend the 
meeting as if to beg the Khmer Rouge for peace, but the Khmer 
Rouge refused to accept peace through negotiation. 
  The government accepted an unconditional cease-fire in place 
to begin at noon on 15 June before holding any further talks. 
But Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan rejected it, claiming that 
foreign troops are still in Cambodia. At the same time, he 
demanded the dismantling of all national institutions from the 
monarchy, government, and National Assembly down to village 
committees. 
  Should we agree to dismantle the national institutions that 
we have built with the assistance of the international community? 
  Both the Cambodians, who own this country, and the 
international community will certainly not agree to this. 
  Therefore, we have only one alternative, that is, to 
continue 
the war to smash the Khmer Rouge, which is just a paper tiger. 
  We have said earlier that only by using war against war can 
we achieve peace. That is, if the roundtable fails due to the 
Khmer Rouge.

  [Text] Jakarta, June 3 (ANTARA) -- PT Wijaya Karya [private 
company] and its brokering company PT Prima Comexindo signed a 
trade contract here Thursday with the Government of 
Turkmenistan, a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States 
(CIS), to supply the former Soviet republic with construction 
products. 
  During the signing ceremony, which was attended by visiting 
Turkmenistan President Saparmurad Niyazov, Indonesia's 
coordinating Minister for Political Affairs and Security Susilo 
Sudarman and Indonesia's Ambassador to CIS countries Rachmat 
Witular, the chamber of commerce and industry from both 
countries also signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to 
encourage economic relations between their entrepreneurs. 
  In his welcoming speech, President Niyazov said that the MOU 
and the trade contract constitute the basis for closer bilateral 
economic cooperation as well as an official framework for 
business activities conducted by the two countries' 
entrepreneurs. 
  He also said that Indonesia may find it attractive to invest 
in the raw material processing industry now being developed in 
Turkmenistan. 
  Turkmenistan, he explained, has oil deposits of some 13 
trillion cubic metres but huge investments are needed for 
processing and transportation. 
  Niyazov also hoped that cooperation might be established 
with 
Indonesia in developing a textile industry in view of 
Turkmenistan's annual production of one million tons of cotton 
and Indonesia's established textile industry. 
  In the meantime, general chairman of Indonesia's Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry Aburizal Bakrie said that the newly signed 
MOU will provide opportunities to Indonesia's and Turkmenistan's 
businessmen to develop opportunities in trade, industry and 
investment. 
  President Director of PT Prima Comexindo Hashim S. 
Jojohadikusumo meanwhile said that bilateral economic relations 
have great potential given that, at 511 thousand tons annually, 
Indonesia is the world's largest cotton importer. 
  According to Jojohadikusumo, in addition to textiles, 
cooperation in investment and trade between Indonesia and 
Turkmenistan could also be established in cement, oil and gas. 
  He added that Indonesia will likely export frying oil, tea, 
aircrafts and railway coaches to Turkmenistan.

  [Text] Jakarta, Jun 6 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Visiting German 
Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development Carl-Dieter 
Spranger on Sunday blasted as "unrealistic" the proposed ban on 
the import of tropical wood products and said the ban will 
impede the conservation of tropical forests which serve as the 
lung of the earth. 
  "If the ban on the import of tropical wood products is 
effective, these forest products might give no economic 
advantage to countries which have tropical forests, and that 
they will find it difficult to conserve their forests," Spranger 
told the press at the Sukarno-Hatta airport a moment before he 
left for home. 
  Environmentalists in the United States and Europe have 
proposed that their governments impose a ban on the import of 
tropical wood products from developing countries. 
  Spranger said he had seen for himself Indonesia's 
well-planned efforts to conserve its forests without necessarily 
sacrificing the ecosystem. 
  It was natural for Indonesia which had huge tropical forests 
to utilize its natural resources, including tropical forests, he 
said. 
  Earlier, Forestry Minister Jamaludin Suryohadikusumo briefed 
the German minister on the management of Indonesian tropical 
forests. Spranger also visited tropical forests in East 
Kalimantan during his stay. 
  According to Spranger, the Indonesian Government was 
determined to conserve its tropical forests while exploiting 
part of them to gain foreign exchange earnings. 
  He said he was in support of Indonesia's efforts to 
disseminate objective information on the management of tropical 
forests in developing countries. 
  In 1993, Indonesia exported an estimated nine million cubic 
meters of tropical wood worth U.S.$6.5 billion. Japan was the 
biggest market for Indonesian tropical wood, followed by the 
United States and European countries. 
  Spranger said Germany was prepared to provide the Indonesian 
Government with technical assistance to manage its tropical 
forests.

  [Text] Defense and Security Minister Edi Sudrajat considers 
the purchase of 39 former East German warships at $1.1 billion 
expensive because the cost could be reduced to $300 million. 
The Indonesian Navy's estimate of $300 million for the warships 
covers the cost of the warships, which also includes repairs, 
voyage expenses, and expenses for port facilities. 
  During his briefing in Jakarta today, Minister Edi Sudrajat 
urged the finance minister to reconsider the current $1.1 
billion allocation because previous finance department 
allocations for the warships had been based on the Indonesian 
Navy's estimates of $300 million. Minister Edi Sudrajat said 
the Navy had taken into consideration the age of the warships, 
which were constructed for war purposes.

President Suharto will not issue a presidential decree on 
foreign investment in mass media although such investment is 
permitted under Government Regulation No. 20/1994. Speaking to 
reporters after meeting the president at Merdeka Palace this 
afternoon, the information minister urged the general public to 
stop making a fuss over the matter because the president's 
policy is clear. Harmoko subsequently urged the general public 
to stop questioning Government Regulation No. 20, particularly 
the clause on possible foreign investment in mass media through 
joint ventures. 
  He also informed the head of state of the indefinite 
postponement of the Islamic Conference Organization information

<F P=106> [Editorial from 3 June PASASON: "Wholeheartedly Welcome the </F>
Premier of the DPRK Administrative Council"] 
  [Text] At the invitation of Comrade Khamtai Siphandon, 
prime minister of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Comrade 
Kang Song-san, premier of the DPRK Administrative Council, will 
lead a delegation to pay an official friendship visit to the Lao 
People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] on 3 June. 
  Reacting to this event of great significance in the 
relations 
of profound friendship and close cooperation between Laos and 
Korea, the entire Lao people and Vientiane residents are 
extremely pleased to have the great honor and an opportunity to 
welcome Comrade Kang Song-san and his entourage right on Lao 
soil. They will bring the goodwill, friendship, and intimate 
brotherly affection from the fraternal Korean people to our Lao 
people. 
  The official friendship visit to our country by the premier 
of the DPRK Administrative Council and his delegation takes 
place after several delegations of Laos and Korea have exchanged 
visits with one another, especially the official friendship 
visit to the DPRK in December 1993 by our high-level party-state 
delegation headed by Comrade Khamtai Siphandon, which ended in 
glorious success. The visit by the DPRK premier clearly 
testifies to the development in the fine relations of friendship 
and close comradely solidarity between the two comrades who 
share common ideals and between the two parties, states, and 
peoples of Laos and Korea. These relations and solidarity have 
been nurtured by President Kim Il-song and President Kaysone 
Phomvihan and further strengthened to continuously bear fruit, 
thereby contributing to the strengthening of solidarity among 
the nations sharing similar ideals and to the building of peace, 
stability, and cooperation among the countries in the 
Asia-Pacific region and the world over. 
  The LPDR and the DPRK consistently have shared common 
objectives and ideals. The Lao and Korean peoples have 
maintained fine relations for a long time. They have 
consistently rendered support and assistance to one another. 
The relations and cooperation between the parties, states, and 
peoples of Laos and Korea have continuously been further 
strengthened. The relations and cooperation between the two 
countries, particularly in the economic field, have advanced, 
especially following the visit to the DPRK by Comrade Khamtai 
Siphandon last December. 
  The Lao people would like to take this opportunity to 
express 
our sincere thanks toward the fraternal Korean party, state, and 
people for having rendered assistance to us in the past. We 
pledge to give consistent support and solidarity to the 
fraternal Korean people in carrying out the just cause of 
defending and building their socialist fatherland in the north, 
in trying to reunify the country through peaceful means, and in 
struggling to turn the Korean peninsula into a zone of peace and 
stability and free from nuclear weapons. 
  We, the Lao people, wish the official friendship visit to 
the 
LPDR by Comrade Kang Song-san, premier of the DPRK 
Administrative Council, and his party success, thereby 
contributing to further strengthening the relations of 
friendship and cooperation between the LPDR and the DPRK.

  [Excerpt] On 3 June at the meeting hall of the National 
Defense Ministry, the Lao-Thai general border peacekeeping 
cooperation committee held a press briefing to deny a charge 
made by the Thai side alleging that the Lao side used toxic 
chemicals in areas along the Lao-Thai border. The charge was 
made by Colonel Prasit Mongkhontham, deputy chief of staff of 
the Third Region of the Thai Army and member of the Thai-Lao 
general border peacekeeping cooperation committee, in his 
interview carried by the 16,298th Saturday issue of the DAILY 
NEWS newspaper on 28 May 1994, the THAILAND TIMES newspaper on 
27 May 1994, and many other Thai newspapers. The colonel 
charged that in the past two months, the Lao People's Army 
sprayed toxic chemicals in water sources and (?lakes) in areas 
along the Thai-Lao border opposite Chiang Kham District in 
Phayao Province, Mae Rim District in Nan Province, and (Bansok) 
Village in Uttaradit Province, killing a large number of animals 
and Lao inhabitants. 
  With regard to this development, the Lao side categorically 
denies such an allegation. The denial was made at the press 
briefing by Brigadier General Douangchai Phisit, member of the 
party Central Committee, deputy chief of the Army General Staff 
Department, and chairman of the Lao-Thai general border 
peacekeeping cooperation committee. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By the Regional Desk] </F>
  [Text] The plight of Laos, a bulwark of the communist bloc 
in Asia until the collapse of Soviet Union, has almost been 
forgotten. 
  It was only with the April opening of the Thai-Lao 
Mittraphap 
bridge, that the land-locked country of six million people began 
to attract the attention of the world media. But most of the 
interest was in its economic potential as it warily opens its 
doors to foreign investment and market economics. 
  However, if Laos is to take advantage of the dynamism that 
has become the hallmark of many of the region's economies it 
will first have to develop its human resources. 
  "There is a lack of understanding at the top leadership 
level 
about how to develop and mobilize basic human resources to take 
up the immense challenges of this development decade," said 
Chansamon Voravong, president of Paris-based Organization of Lao 
Community for Refugees and National Communities (Orlec). 
  "It may take another twenty years before the technicians and 
professionals in training at present become operational, and 
resorting to foreign experts without capable supervision, 
coordination, control and reliable evaluation, not only 
constitutes human and financial waste, but also hinders the 
solution of human resource development of the country," he said. 
  While hailing Vientiane's programme to focus on human 
resource development as the right way to reach its stated target 
of sustainable economic development, Chansamon said it failed to 
address two inseparable issues -- democracy and national 
reconciliation. 
  Without the two things, human resource development will not 
work, he said. "There cannot be national reconciliation without 
democracy. There cannot be democracy without a sustainable 
economy," said Chansamon. 
  In an interview with The Region, Chansamon pointed out the 
present government could no longer rely on foreign help for 
resource mobilization. He said the magnate of foreign 
assistance has now shifted to Vietnam with its potentially vast 
human resources and market of 70 million consumers. 
International aid agencies will, meanwhile, be focusing on 
war-ravaged Cambodia. 
  As such, he said the government should re-orientate its 
focus 
to tap the overseas Laotian community, who collectively 
represent an immense pool of human resource in know how capital 
and access to markets which are crucial to the economic and 
human resource development of Laos. 
  Vientiane's self-articulated economic development priorities 
-- education and cultural and national preservation -- in order 
to sustain a qualitative growth over a quantitative growth will 
be hard to implement without skilled administrators, he said. 
  Chansamon was among the 10 percent of the Laotian population 
who joined the exodus for fear of political persecution 
following the communist victory in 1975. Many of the exiles 
have successfully transformed them selves into world-class 
entrepreneurs, investors, technical experts, manager, bankers, 
social service administrators and leaders in other fields. 
  "Finding ways to access and tap this valuable human 
resource pool represents a major challenge and opportunity for 
the government, said the 64 year-old former senior government 
official of the right-wing government. He left the country in 
1979 after being held for four years in a rehabilitation camp. 
  Tens of thousands of Laotians, who formed the core of the 
intellectual and skilled resources base of the country, were 
sent to "rehabilitation camps". After more than ten years, less 
than one percent have been re-integrated into the socio-economic 
structure of the nation, according to a paper written by 
Chansamon. 
  "Pragmatic, realistic, reconciliatory and perhaps 
imaginative 
ways must be found to heal the wounded hearts and minds, to 
reestablish mutual trust and to instill new hope and confidence 
in the future among Laotians from all walks of life, said 
Chansamon in his report presented to recent international 
meeting in Tokyo. 
  His organization has been campaigning for five years under a 
programme called the "Loatian Democratic Initiative" to educate 
overseas Laotians and to improve the understanding of and 
commitment to democratic values among the populace. 
  Once allied to the anti-Vientiane Hmong leader Vang Pao in 
its armed struggle against the Vientiane socialists, his group 
later renounced the cooperation for peaceful means. 
  "We believed Laotian overseas or in the country share the 
same aspirations for peaceful political reform and improvement 
of economic conditions. But those living inside the country 
cannot express these aspirations without danger," said the 
report on prospects for national reconciliation. 
  "Some present Lao government officials who can discuss with 
expatriates, have not yet seen how the word democracy can be 
utilized without fear of punishment or any other wordings which 
are not in line with the party's parlance," he said. 
  Chansamon said during the interview that the mobilization of 
human resources in the country will never work for Laos if the 
government did not allow people to speak up and put their 
capabilities to the test. 
  He said he believed Laos would not be suffering from a such 
a 
dire shortage of experts and academics if it had allowed the 
limited number of educated "cream" to speak up and express their 
opinions. 
  Since the communist takeover, the general election of a 
National Assembly and promulgation of a Constitution and legal 
reforms had yet to translate into real democracy and freedom, 
his report said. 
  On the contrary, the party still condemned the dissemination 
of documents and ideas about democracy and human rights, which 
the party considers as a sinister new approach, a peaceful 
manoeuvre by the "enemies of the People's regime", it said. 
  Chansamon said the government should rather provide 
conditions conducive to attract educated Laotians abroad to 
return and help with the skill they had accumulated. 
  Although the government has eased visits and contacts 
between 
Laotians in and outside the country and persuaded them to return 
for national development, there were no formal legal guarantees 
for their safety or liberty, Chansamon said. 
  For example, he said there was no legal framework to ensure 
their adopted nationality would be recognized. 
  There were no legal offers including the amnesty programme 
to 
guarantee the safety of former anti-government activists if they 
return. 
  Vientiane recently claimed the government's programme to 
persuade overseas Laotians to return home since 1978 had met 
with success. Laotian Ambassador to Thailand Bounkeut 
Sangsomsak said more than 30,000 overseas Laotians have returned 
home outside the UN programme. He said the government continued 
through its embassies in many capitals where expat Laotians live 
to appeal to them to return. 
  But Chansamon said only a few hundred had so far returned 
home for good. 
  "The time is right. An unstable Laos would ultimately be a 
factor of imbalance and instability in the region. Any effort 
for reconciliation and harmonious economic and social 
development in this country would be beneficial for the 
stability of the region, for peace and mutual understanding in 
the world as well," he concluded.

  [Text] The East Timor conference is now on its fourth day 
in Manila. In a video taped message to the delegates, Timorese 
rebel leader, Jose Ramos-Horta calls for negotiations to resolve 
the conflict in East Timor which Indonesia annexed in 1976. 
Horta was one of the foreign participants who were barred from 
entering the country. 
  The conference has been discussing alleged human rights 
violations in East Timor. During the conference the conveners 
also discussed the peace plan drafted by Horta and was earlier 
presented to the European Union in Brussels, Belgium in April 
1992. The peace plan states that the people of East Timor hope 
to build a society based on democracy and where the citizens are 
conscious of their responsibilities. 
  The peace plan also envisage three phases that should be 
undertaken upon withdrawal of Indonesian armed forces from East 
Timor. First, the first two years will be set for the holding 
of Indonesia-Portugal talks under the auspices of the United 
Nations Secretary General and with the participation of the East 
Timorese people. Phase two is anchored on a five-year 
transition stage in which East Timorese would govern themselves 
democratically through having their own local institutions. And 
phase three is defined as the stage of East Timor 
self-determination whereby the East Timorese may choose between 
free association or integration into Indonesia or independence.

  [Text] For its strong effort to stave off the holding of 
the Asia-Pacific Conference on East Timor in Manila, the Ramos 
administration is asking Indonesia to return the gesture. 
President Ramos is asking for the immediate release of some 90 
Filipino fishermen detained since last month in North Sulawesi. 
President Ramos expressed hope that Jakarta would accede to 
Manila's request. He evoked the phrase ASEAN cooperation and 
brotherhood, the same words he used to ban foreign delegates on 
the East Timor conference.

  [Text] Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo and German 
Ambassador Dr. Peter Scholz signed recently a protocol on 
financial assistance which secures funds for further enhancement 
of vital infrastructures. 
  Under the arrangement, Germany will provide a loan of 
Deutsche Marks (DM) 30 million for the Philippines to meet the 
demands for electricity generation in Metro Manila including the 
construction of a 230-KV high voltage transmission line between 
Labrador and Masinloc and the Labrador substation expansion. 
  In addition, Germany grants another DM 20 million for the 
improvement of potable water supply in seven rural areas. 
  Power and water supply are two of several major concerns of 
RP [Republic of the Philippines]-German cooperation. 
  By financing these projects through KfW (Kreditanstalt fuer 
Wiederaufbau, Frankfurt) Germany continues to address critical 
points of Philippine development with emphasis on environmental 
protection.

  [Text] The government has launched a massive man-hunt 
operation against the Abu Sayaf group in connection with the 
bombing incident in Zamboanga City, which wounded 32 people. 
The Philippine National Police [PNP] ordered the manhunt 
following the severe explosion, which took place at around 8:30 
P.M. [Philippine time) along Urdaneta and Tomas Claudio Streets 
in Zamboanga City. PNP Director for Operation (Sagerico) 
Kagawan said that this was probably a tactic of the Abu Sayaf 
group to divert the attention of the military and police from 
their continued operations in Sulu. 
  [Begin Kagawan recording] As of now, about 10 local leaders, 
both civilian and military, are negotiating with the Abu Sayaf 
for them to come out and maybe surrender. And of course they 
will be accorded due process. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, military and police authorities have announced 
that they are ready to stop any operations against the Abu Sayaf 
group. This was announced by Kagawan in spite of the ongoing 
operation staged by the combined forces of the police and the 
military. Based on the latest report, the military and police 
have already started besieging the island of Patikul, where 40 
rebels have already been killed -- including one of the leaders 
of Abu Sayaf, who was alleged to be responsible for the 
kidnappings in Mindanao -- while government troops suffered six 
casualties. Kagawan said that the rebels still have the 
opportunity to surrender and enjoy their rights of due process. 
  [Begin Kagawan recording] It is very logical; it's part of 
their strategy. They usually do such things to ease the 
pressure there in Patikul. They have to create a diversion, 
giving an impression that they also have a sizable force in 
Zamboanga so that maybe some of the forces that are utilized 
there in Patikul will have to be withdrawn and run after the 
perpetrators there in Zamboanga. It's like you dissipate the 
forces so that maybe the pressure on you will decrease. [end

  [Text] Riding on recent positive developments in the 
economy, the country's net foreign investments posted a 
triple-digit growth of 289 percent to $677 million during the 
first quarter from the previous quarter's $174 million, 
preliminary figures obtained by Business World from the Bangko 
Sentral ng Pilipinas [Central Bank of the Philippines] show. 
  This represents a 164.4 percent upsurge from the level in 
the 
comparative period last year, which was $256 million. 
  This development, in effect, reverses the negative trend 
established last year when net foreign investments dipped by 17 
percent when capital outflows outpaced inflows. 
  For the first time after a series of dumps, inflows during 
the first quarter this year grew by 205.2 percent to $1.63 
billion, compared with $534 million during the same period in 
1993. 
  Against the previous quarter's level of $1.019 billion, 
inflows posted a 59.96 percent increase. 
  The tremendous boost in inflows mainly came from portfolio 
investments or investments in the stock market were registered 
at $736 million, and new foreign investments were worth $556 
million for the quarter. 
  Remittances, which combine personal income ($598 million) 
and 
withdrawals from 247/543 accounts ($589 million) also accounted 
for the bulk of non-merchandise transactions. 
  On the other hand, outflows which are in the form of capital 
withdrawals, capital for investments abroad, outward remittances 
from bank inter-branch operations, and proceeds from portfolio 
investments, amounted to $953 million. This represents a 243 
percent increase from $278 million the same period last year, 
and 12.78 percent hike from the fourth quarter's $108-million 
level. 
  Total capital taken out of the country amounted to $534 
million, while investments in foreign countries' stock markets 
reached $369 million. These two factors comprised the bulk of 
foreign investment outflows. 
  Bangko Sentral Gov. Gabriel C. Singson explained that the 
continuous surge in foreign currency deposit unit (FCDU) 
accounts could have been tapped by investors as a way of 
returning to the country the substantial amount of capital flown 
out during the Marcos years. 
  The surge in FCDU accounts persists even as there are heavy 
withdrawals noted from such accounts which are, in turn, being 
sold in the foreign exchange market in exchange for local 
currency. 
  This helps buoy up the exchange value of the peso against 
the 
dollar. 
  Total outstanding FCDU balance as of April, he said, amounts 
to $5.8 billion, including the $300 million worth of 
non-resident accounts. 
  Total FCDU accounts in end 1993 amounted to around $5.4 
billion to $5.5 billion in spite of the $2.962 billion in 
withdrawals from such accounts. 
  Mr. Singson believes the FCDU accounts are being used as a 
vehicle to bring back capital that investors had scurried out 
during the crisis years in the eighties, which resulted in 
massive capital flights. 
  Mr. Singson has recently been under fire from exporters for 
allowing the peso value to further strengthen.

  [Text] An Iranian bombing suspect denies any involvement 
in a foiled attempt to car-bomb the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok 
on March 11, saying he was in Phatthaya on that day, 
Metropolitan Police Bureau Commissioner Chaisit Kanchanakit said 
yesterday. 
  Hossein Shahriarifar, 26, however, allegedly implicated two 
other Iranians arrested with him in the southern tourist town of 
Hat Yai on Friday as taking part in falsifying passports, Pol 
Lt-Gen Chaisit said. 
  Shahriarifar and another Iranian suspect, Mohammadi 
Lotfollar, who is still at large, were sought under arrest 
warrants issued by the police last week on charges of conspiring 
to commit premeditated murder, robbery resulting in the death of 
others, and making and possessing explosives. 
  The warrants were issued after the police said they had 
evidence to prove the two were behind a plot to car-bomb the 
embassy. 
  The bombing plan ran into trouble when the bomb-laden 
six-wheel truck allegedly driven by Hossein accidentally hit a 
motorcycle-taxi near Central Chitlom department store a short 
distance from the embassy. 
  After failing to negotiate with the motorcycle driver, the 
truck driver, said to be an Arab-looking man, fled the scene. 
  The truck from a rental company was then taken to Lumphini 
police station where it was left for about a week before its 
owner found a water tank containing C-4 plastic explosives wired 
to a diesel fuel tank. 
  The body of Chom Thila, a Thai employee of the rental firm, 
was found in the tank. 
  Nine witnesses yesterday identified Hossein, detained at the 
Metropolitan Police Private School in Bang Khen, as the truck 
driver, according to Pol Lt Gen Chaisit. 
  Shahriarifar and his two Iranian friends, Babak Taheri and 
Basr Kazemi, were caught early Friday morning at the Inthra 
Hotel in Hat Yai. 
  A source at an immigration office in Songkhla's Sadao 
district said Shahriarifar held a valid passport issued by Iran 
under the name Pajiri Mahmed and entered Thailand through the 
immigration checkpoint on Thursday. 
  Since Shahriarifar's photo in the passport allegedly looked 
similar to a sketch produced by Lumphini police station and 
distributed to immigration offices across the country, an 
immigration officer advised Hat Yai police to keep a close watch 
on the man who checked-in at the hotel later on Thursday. 
  The source said Shahriarifar had entered and left Thailand 
through the immigration checkpoints in Sadao and Su-ngai Kolok 
districts more than 10 times under different names. 
  The immigration officers, however, earlier could not 
identify 
him because they did not have his photograph. 
  Pol Lt-Gen Chaisit said Shahriarifar, believed to have left 
the country after his failure to allegedly bomb the embassy, 
came back because he had fallen in love with a Thai woman in Hat 
Yai. 
  The suspect also might have thought that the Thai police had 
called off their investigation. 
  Pol Lt-Gen Chaisit said Shahriarifar did not implicate the 
other suspect as being involved in the embassy bombing plot. 
  He said the police found the gang had its command centre in 
Malaysia where one of its leading members had been caught by 
Malaysian police on charges of falsifying documents. 
  The Metropolitan Police Bureau is looking for additional 
witnesses and evidence against Shahriarifar in Bangkok and 
southern provinces. 
  Investigations will be completed in seven days and the 
suspect will then be charged in the Criminal Court, Pol Lt-Gen 
Chaisit said. 
  Metropolitan Police Bureau deputy commissioner Sophon 
Waratchanon dismissed concern that Shahriarifar might try to 
kill himself, saying the suspect did not seem not under stress. 
  Neither the Iranian nor the Israeli embassies have contacted 
the police since the arrest of Shahriarifar, he said. 
  Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut said in Cha-am 
yesterday that the car-bomb attempt was connected with some 
"Thai people in Bangkok". 
  "I thought there would be a lot more to come. Something 
strange would happen," Gen Chawalit said. He did not elaborate. 
  He said the Interior Ministry had told the Iranian Embassy 
that the Thai police were proceeding with the case.

  [Text] Police yesterday arrested another Iranian in 
connection with the abortive truck-bomb conspiracy discovered in 
Bangkok in March. 
  The new suspect was arrested upon arriving Hat Yai Airport. 
Police refused to identify the suspect and would not allow the 
press to cover the arrest. 
  Meanwhile Bangkok police chief Pol Lt Gen Chaisit 
Kanchanakit 
said the other Iranian, who was charged on Friday in connection 
with the conspiracy had sneaked back into Thailand because he 
was involved with a Thai woman. 
  But informed sources said police had not ruled the 
possibility that Hossein Shahriari Far, 26, returned to Thailand 
for a second sabotage attempt. 
  Chaisit said the suspect was "too complacent and thought 
that 
Thai authorities had given up their attempts to catch him". 
  Far was arrested on Friday night at the Inthra Hotel in 
Songkhla's Hat Yai district. 
  The sources also said they believed those involved in the 
plot still had a supply of C-4 plastic explosive hidden some 
where in Thailand and believed to be in the possession of a Thai 
woman. 
  Police have summoned more than 40 witnesses for questioning. 
They have finished interviews with 10 of them, according to the 
sources, who said investigators had been ordered to wrap up 
their inquiries in seven days. 
  The sources added that police had reliable evidence 
indicating that the plot was directed at the Israeli Embassy. 
The evidence includes a bag that is the same as those 
distributed at a Palestinian training camp. 
  Two other Iranians taken into custody during the same raid 
in 
Hat Yai are being held for questioning. 
  Far is scheduled to appear in South Bangkok District Court 
on 
June 9.

Thailand [CTT] on 31 May. The delegation was warmly welcomed 
by Acting Chairman of the CTT Zheng Weichang [Thai name: Wichian 
Techaphaibun] and other CTT executive members. 
  In his welcoming speech, Zheng Weichang said: The CTT 
chairman asked me to receive you because he is leading a 
delegation on visits to Western European and South American 
countries. I, on behalf of the CTT, extend a warm welcome to 
the Chinese economic and trade delegation. The CTT and the 
China Council for the Promotion of International Trade have 
maintained close contacts for a long time. CTT Chairman Suwit 
Wangli led a delegation to visit China last year in July. The 
visit achieved great success because of the assistance provided

  Zheng Weichang continued: I am very glad to learn that your 
delegation is visiting Thailand to open the Thai-Chinese 
International Trade Promotion Center. The CTT would like to 
take this great opportunity to welcome this cooperation between

  [Text] Thailand is partly to be blamed for the inflow of 
HIV and AIDS to its neighbouring countries, Cambodia and Laos. 
  "Neighbouring Thailand has some of the highest HIV rates in 
the world," said Cambodia's Public Health undersecretary Dr Uk 
Ingkim in his report to an international conference this week. 
  The report was presented at the Technical Cooperation among 
Developing Countries (TCDC) Inter-regional Symposium for 
Capacity Enhancement in Primary Health Care and HIV/AIDS, 
organised by the United Nations Development Programme. 
  Dr Ingkim said the challenge to Cambodia was formidable. 
  The political situation in the country remained unstable and 
was characterised by large shifts in population, porous borders, 
socio-economic disruption and limited public services. 
  According to his report, risky behaviour could be 
characterised as primarily sexual. 
  Dr Ingkim said HIV was brought into the country mainly by 
foreigners and repatriated refugees from Thailand. 
  "Commercial sex has grown rapidly since 1991, promoted by 
economic liberalisation, an influx of foreign business, tourism, 
relief and development personnel and the UN Peacekeeping Forces 
(UNTAC)," said his report. 
  Dr Ingkim said it was estimated there were 2,000 commercial 
sex workers in the capital and their number was growing 
noticeably in economic centres and western provinces like ports 
of Sihanoukville and Koh Kong. 
  The country report presented by Laos' HIV/AIDS Prevention 
and 
Control Programme coordinator Chanthon Sibounheuang stated that 
an alarming incidence of HIV/AIDS in Thailand caused Laos to 
believe it might soon face a similar situation. 
  "The opening of the Laotian economy and the completion of 
the 
Mekong River bridge between Thailand and Laos could lead to an 
increase in HIV and AIDS," Dr Sibounheuang said. 
  His report also stated that most of the HIV positive cases 
in 
Laos were returnees and refugees from Thailand and bar workers, 
many of them from provinces bordering Thailand. 
  As of December 1993, more than 15,000 HIV tests had been 
conducted in Laos with a total of 38 persons diagnosed as HIV 
positive. 
  To date only three AIDS cases have been reported. 
  The first round sentinel surveillance conducted last 
October-December in five provinces, showed that out of 1,844 
blood samples from different groups of students, military 
recruits, bar workers, villagers, pregnant women and prisoners, 
only three people were HIV positive and all three had returned 
from Thailand, Laos's representative said.

  [Text] The National Security Council will present its 
security policy for 1994-1998 for the southern region to the 
Cabinet on Tuesday, Government House sources said yesterday. 
  The policy is aimed at establishing security in the South, 
which has been plagued by Muslim separatist attacks and bombings. 
  According to the sources, the policy will aim at: 
  -- Social psychology: The building of understanding and the 
decreasing of suspicion to increase cooperation at all levels of 
society. 
  -- Economic development: Ensuring that development plans can 
yield results. While there will be no more special investment 
privileges than in the other three investment zones, it is 
necessary to develop other facilities to attract investors, 
since the South is far from the centre of government. These 
include basic infrastructure, such as communications and 
transportation. 
  -- Administration: Improve the political and administrative 
methods, in particular the efficiency of civil servants so that 
they do not become a cause for dissatisfaction among the people. 
Increase the participation of the people through local 
administration bodies, and improve the efficiency of agencies 
responsible for realising policies at the national and local 
levels. 
  -- Law and order: Continue to use politics before military 
action, in conjunction with covert operations, to pressure armed 
rebels. Separatist movements are still capable of terrorist and 
sabotage acts, and resources will have to be put into security 
work in the police and military. 
  -- Foreign affairs: Continue to forge good relations with 
neighbours so that cooperation can bring mutual benefit. 
Cooperation will have to be sought from Muslim countries while 
increasing economic links, trade and investment. 
  -- Policy administration: Though there is a special form of 
administration under the Fourth Army Region Commander, there is 
disunity and inefficiency, which lead to difficulties in solving 
problems. Better coordination will be needed and resources 
provided, and the frame of reference for any work will have to 
be made more clear.

<F P=106> ["Points To Ponder In Enacting Money Laundering Control Law" </F>
by "Nakhon Thon Bank's Technical Section"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The application of the law 
against money laundering will support the prevention of 
laundering illicit money, help prevent damage to the financial 
system, help discourage financial crime, and prepare the country 
to become the regional financial center. It will also create a 
good image and credibility in the eyes of other countries. the 
following points should be taken into account, however: 
  1. The application of the law against money laundering will 
involve several agencies, such as the Finance Ministry, the Bank 
of Thailand, the financial institutions, and the law enforcement 
agencies. Therefore, these agencies should jointly study the 
impact of the law. 
  2. The law should be considered in conjunction with the 
principles of the financial liberalization policy and the 
national economic development policy. 
  3. Other relevant laws and the money laundering laws of 
other 
countries should be studied for possible adaptation. 
  4. The methods and tricks used in money laundering, which 
are 
becoming increasingly complicated as time passes, should be 
monitored. 
  5. More steps that have to be followed by foreign investors 
should be taken into consideration, as well as the trouble these 
steps may cause them. 
  6. The increased burden and cost to financial institutions 
must be considered. 
  7. Legitimate rights of honest businesspeople must not be 
affected. 
  In any event, before a money laundering law is in effect, 
effective control and monitoring measures existing in current 
laws can help prevent and control money laundering practices.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA June 5 -- Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh 
Cam highlighted the active, important roles of the Non-Aligned 
Movement [NAM] in the present world situation, and its two main 
goals namely cooperation for peace, stability and development, 
particularly the trend for stability and development, in 
Southeast Asia, and human rights. 
  Addressing the 11th ministerial conference of the 
non-aligned 
countries recently held in Cairo, F.M. Cam noted that in an 
interdependent and constantly changeable world, regional and 
sub-regional cooperation was of vital importance and great 
practical significance. 
  The Vietnamese chief diplomat noted: `Recently the East Sea 
area has witnessed some events that caused great worries to 
public opinion in the region and the world, particularly to us 
because these events happened on our country's continental shelf 
and exclusive economic zone. The international laws demand all 
countries to respect sovereignty and territorial integrity of 
others including their continental shelf and exclusive economic 
zone. We reiterate Vietnam's sovereignty as a coastal country, 
and the Vietnamese people's determination to protect sovereignty 
over their continental shelf and exclusive economic zone in 
accordance with the international laws, especially the 1982 
Convention on Sea of United Nations. At the same time, we 
reaffirm Vietnam's goodwill stance to settle all differences on 
the above-said principles, especially the principles of the 1982 
Sea Convention...' 
  On the human right issue, Mr. Cam noted that the draft final 
statement of the conference highlighted the movement's 
fundamental viewpoints, the principles of independence, 
sovereignty, self-determination and freedom to choose the path 
of development of all nations. He stressed that the movement's 
official documents relating to human rights should reserve a 
worthy part to the right of national development as a 
fundamental human right. We cannot accept the use of human 
rights as condition for relations among countries. This, he 
said, does not start from the principle of respect for national 
sovereignty and equality among nations moreover it violates the 
rights of development of all nations. 
  The Vietnamese foreign minister stressed it is the people of 
each country who have their rights to judge and push ahead the 
implementation of human rights in their own countries. 
  During his stay in the Egyptian capital, F.M. Nguyen Manh 
Cam met with foreign ministers and head delegates of a number of 
countries including Egypt, Cuba, India, Laos, Cambodia, the 
ASEAN Cam met with foreign ministers and head delegates of a 
number of South Africa. [sentence as received]

Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Vietnamese Prime Minsiter Vo Van 
Kiet will visit to these countries in mid-June. It's the first 
visit by the prime minister to these countries. Due to recent 
changes in the international situation, traditional ties between 
Vietnam and these countries have not yet developed according to 
each country's potentials. At present, Vietnam and these 
nations wish to further strengthen and consolidate their 
friendship and cooperation. It's planned that a number of 
agreements will be signed, serving as a legal ground to promote 
cooperation. 
  Asked about the planned visit to Vietnam by United States

translation] United Nation High Commission for Refugees and 
other countries at the meeting of the sixth coordination 
committee held in Geneva early this year appreciated Vietnam's 
effort and cooperation in human policy in carrying out the 
repatriation progress. Vietnam has applied a number of measures 
to check the flow of departures and at the same time, 
cooperation with the High Commission for Refugees and countries 
concerned to promote the Program of Voluntary Repatriation. 
Vietnam has streamlined procedures and increased the number of 
interviews and broaden possibility to receive voluntary 
repatriates while creating conditions for them to reintegrate

continue its cooperation with international organizations and 
countries to soon settle the question of refugees. 
  Asked whether the recent general survey conducted by the 
Natural Science and National Technology Center of Vietnam in

conducted elsewhere throughout the country.

<F P=106> [Statement by FRG Minister of Cooperation and Development </F>
Carl-Dieter Spranger "in late May"; place not given -- recorded; 
in German, with superimposed Vietnamese translation] 
  [Text] Our delegation's visit to Vietnam was made at the 
invitation of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet during his June 1992 
visit to the FRG and by His Excellency Do Quoc San, head of the 
State Planning Commission. We appreciate these invitations, as 
they have made possible our visit to Vietnam. We have heartfelt 
impressions of the hospitality and the impeccable welcome 
extended to our delegation. 
  Our visit was to evaluate the current cooperative situation 
while sounding out potential areas of cooperation. Now that 
thousands of Vietnamese can speak German, this is a highly 
valuable asset needed for our future cooperation. In the 
relations of development cooperation, we expect that these 
people will be provided with assistance and favorable conditions 
so they can surge forward. It is our policy to assist the 
efforts of developing countries rather than imposing any 
prototypes, and we wish to see our cooperation coordinate with 
the cultural and social conditions of each country. 
  The cooperation between our two countries has been 
reestablished since 1990. The FRG has since reserved some 170 
million German marks in aid for Vietnam. In addition, the FRG 
has made remarkable contributions under the framework of 
multilaterial cooperation to helping Vietnam. Here I would like 
to refer to various programs sponsored by EC [European 
Community], UNDP [United Nations Development Programs], the 
Asian Development Bank, and the World Bank. 
  It can be said that the cooperation between our two 
countires 
has been focused on such areas as environmental protection and 
natural resource protection, and especially the issue of 
afforestation. Here I would like to refer to the questions of 
providing assistance for economic and banking reforms and for 
public admnistration, of encouraging the development of and 
providing assistance for medium-and small-size enterprises, 
creating conditions to obtain credit funds to help various 
enterprises as well as to initiate some vocational training 
programs. 
  We have helped with perfecting the power transmission 
network 
in the central region and with restoring some locomotives. We 
have also provided assistance in the areas of agriculture and in 
rural development. 
  It should also be pointed out the significance of the 
reintegration program under which employment has been created 
for those Vietnamese returning from Germany. 
  During this visit, we visited two enterprises run by 
Vietnamese returning from Germany. Since the start of this 
project in 1993, we have provided assistance to nearly 500 
people. We have helped build initial bases and have therefore 
created nearly 6,000 jobs. 
  We have all agreed that the development of our cooperative 
relations is moving in the right direction. The Vietnamese side 
has emphasized and highly appreciated the assistance given by 
Germany in the area of economic reform. Here I would like to 
further point out that we have exchanged views with the minister 
of labor, war invalids, and social welfare over our increased 
assistance in vocational training; and with the minister of 
justice over our assistance for the building and expansion of 
the legislative system. Thus, basically we are ready to further 
increase our development cooperation. Meanwhile, we expect that 
in the upcoming period, the two sides will jointly resolve their 
bilateral issues still left open, that is the debt issue and the 
signing of a reintegration agreement, etc... 
  The fine progress in Vietnam's economic and political 
reforms 
at present will have great significance not only for Vietnam but 
also for the entire region. 
  The FRG Government is ready to support Vietnam in its 
efforts 
to develop its market-oriented and democracy-based economies and 
a law-governing state.

its eighth work day today. In the morning plenary meeting, the 
National Assembly continued to discuss the revised draft law on 
elections of the People's Councils under the direction of 
National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh. 
  The revised draft law includes a preamble and 71 articles in 
10 chapters. The draft law amends 54 articles, supplements 10 
others, and retains the other seven articles of the old law. 
  During their discussion, the deputies expressed their 
unanimous views on the quality of deputies specified by the 
revised draft law as persons who are loyal to the socialist 
Vietnamese fatherland, who can represent the people in various 
ways, who have records of good conduct and abide strictly by the 
law, who are enthusiastic in protecting the interests of the 
state and the people, who have good general backgrounds, are 
competent in carrying out National Assembly activities and 
resolving pressing local issues, and who are trusted by the 
people. 
  The deputies also discussed the composition of People's 
Councils and the quality of people's councilors. Some deputies 
suggested that candidates who failed in the first election 
should not be allowed to run in People's Councils by-elections, 
and that only new candidates should be allowed in such 
elections. Other deputies said that efforts should be made to 
ensure equality of rights between nominated candidates and 
independent candidates, and so forth. 
  This afternoon the National Assembly will continue its work 
at the conference hall in Hanoi.

  [Summary] "Dear friends: The Ninth National Assembly's 
fifth session entered its ninth day today. 
  "The National Assembly worked at the conference hall in the 
morning under the direction of National Assembly Vice Chairman 
Dang Quan Thuy. 
  "The deputies debated a revised draft law on the amendment 
of 
and supplement to a number of articles on the law on military 
service. There were 21 deputies airing their views. All those 
who spoke favored the idea of amending and supplementing the law 
on military service now in force. Most of them hailed the fact 
that the draft law had been supplemented with Articles 11, 9, 
23, 56, and 61 on the duty of economic organizations and of the 
administration to muster youths to comply with the law on 
military service. They pointed out the need to assign relevant 
economic organizations, public organs, and units with the duty 
of accepting their former personnel who have returned from 
military service. Many deputies asked that the law clearly 
specify that in cases where these organizations or organs are 
deactivated, the responsibility of arranging employment for 
these youths will rest with the War Invalids and Social Welfare 
Offices concerned." 
  Some deputies proposed that the law further specify the 
responsibility of People's Councils at various levels to 
supervise the enforcement of the law on military service. The 
question of temporary military deferment or temporary military 
exemption was also intensively discussed. 
  "The general views are that the law on military service has 
been carried out in a biased fashion, as there are fewer youths 
from wealthy families or whose fathers are party cadres and 
members carrying out military service than less-educated youths 
from poor families. It is precisely due to this that many 
deputies favor the idea of offering an appropriate benefit 
policy to those who have fulfilled their military service." 
  Some deputies urged the defense minister to reexamine the 
training program for two-year military draftees "as there have 
been complaints about military draftees having to spend more 
time on manual labor than on military training." 
  "Others proposed that members of Assault Youth Forces be 
exempted from military service." 
  This afternoon, the National Assembly deputies split up into 
groups for discussions.

  [Summary] "Dear friends: The Ninth National Assembly's 
fifth session entered its 10th day today. The National Assembly 
held group discussions in the morning and a plenary meeting in 
the afternoon under the direction of National Assembly Vice 
Chairman Nguyen Ha Phan to discuss the draft law on encouraging 
investment at home." 
  This is the draft law that has been formulated over a long 
period of time on the basis of ideas solicited from various 
discussions, sectors, and the people. 
  "National Assembly deputies focussed their discussion on 
issues such as the name of the law, its relationship with other 
laws, enforcement of the law, forms of investment, measures to 
protect investment projects, and state management on encouraging 
investment and so forth." 
  Most deputies contend that it is necessary to promulgate the 
law as soon as possible. They agreed that it should be called 
the Law on Encouraging Investment at Home. 
  "Many deputies suggested that overseas Vietnamese who want 
to 
invest in Vietnam should not be treated as Vietnamese investors 
at home. Other deputies, however, argued that to promote and 
attract investment by overseas Vietnamese we should create 
favorable conditions for them to invest in the country." 
  Many deputies also suggested that the law should encourage 
afforestation projects, reduce or exempt taxes for investment 
projects in areas with numerous difficulties or in regions 
inhabited by ethnic minorities. Other deputies suggested that 
to avoid inconvenience caused by paper work and negativism, the 
law should clearly stipulate that people's committees of 
provinces and municipalities directly subordinate to the central 
government, are units authorized with the power to receive 
applications of investors for consideration and forwarding to 
agencies concerned for approval. 
  Tomorrow, 7 June, the National Assembly will continue its 
work at the conference hall in Hanoi.

  [Text] According to a news release from the Lao-American 
Joint Technical Team, the team opened offices in two northern 
provinces of Houa Phan and Xieng Khouang to carry out joint 
operations between 4 May and 1 June. They were implementing the 
humanitarian plan and policy of the Government of the Lao 
People's Democratic Republic toward families of American 
personnel missing in action during the war in Laos and 
responding to the U.S. side's request for cooperation in 
conducting surveys and excavations and investigating and 
searching for American MIA's. 
  During the period, technicians from both sides jointly 
conducted excavations at two points in Houa Phan Province -- 
points 2935 and 1336. In addition, the Lao Government granted 
permission for the American technicians to investigate and find 
out about American MIA's at a former detention camp in Viangsai 
District, Houa Phan Province. These are MIA's whom the U.S. 
side believes to be still alive. Through the excavations at the 
two points, the technicians of both sides satisfactorily found a 
lot of evidence and information. Following the investigation, 
the team discovered that there are no living American MIA's as 
suspected by the U.S. side. The joint operation in Houa Phan 
Province began on 4 May and ended on 19 May. 
  Later, the technicians of both sides continued their work in 
Xieng Khouang Province according to plans. In Xieng Khouang 
Province, they conducted excavations at four points -- points 
1558, 1432, 1926, and 1786. The joint excavation in this 
province began on 19 May and ended on 30 May. It brought about 
satisfactory achievements to the U.S. side. The joint operation 
in Xieng Khouang Province, however, has not been completed yet. 
Three more points remain to be excavated. The excavations at 
these three points will be conducted in accordance with the 
1993-94 plan. In this plan, in addition to jointly conducting 
excavations, the Lao side allowed the U.S. side to investigate 
two cases in Xieng Khouang Province at point 0060 and point 
0925. The results of the case investigations has been 
considerably good. 
  The Lao-U.S. joint operation on this occasion was correctly 
carried out in accordance with the plan and it proceeded in a 
good atmosphere of mutual understanding. The U.S. side has 
highly appraised the achievements and expressed profound thanks 
to the Lao side for the good cooperation.

  [Text] President Fidel Ramos strongly indicated on Sunday 
the Philippine Government will support the initiative of U.S. 
President Bill Clinton to seek United Nations economic sanctions 
against North Korea to force it to allow inspections of its 
clandestine nuclear program. 
  In a statement released by Malacanang [presidential office], 
Mr. Ramos said Manila may have to reverse its position on the 
Korean nuclear standoff as a result of the inability of 
international inspectors to gain access to Pyongyang's suspect 
nuclear site. 
  Under a Cabinet Cluster E position approved by Ramos last 
February, the government said it must not support at this time 
the imposition of economic sanctions against Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea since it would only provoke Pyongyang to 
resort to military confrontation. 
  The president said the Philippine Government may have to 
review its position on the nuclear issue in the Korean 
peninsula. Such a review may be rendered necessary by the 
announcement of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] on 
2 June of the inability of its inspectors to determine whether 
there has been any diversion of fuel from North Korea's five MWA 
experimental nuclear power reactors. 
  The government's announcement of a review of its position on 
the nuclear standoff in the Korean peninsula indicates a 
possible reversal of its diplomatic agenda and may even mean 
support for the Clinton administration's confrontational stance 
in dealing with the reclusive North Korean military regime. 
  With the IAEA's latest failure to gain access to Pyongyang's 
nuclear sites, particularly its top secret plant in Yongbyon, 
members of the UN Security Council lead by the United States and 
France are pressing for the imposition of sanctions with North 
Korea. 
  According to President Ramos, it is in the light of this new 
situation the Philippines state in the nonproliferation of 
nuclear weapons and its responsibility as a member of the IAEA 
board of governors that we are now undertaking a serious review 
of our policy of this matter. 
  Earlier, the U.S. Defense Department gave North Korea till 
this month to comply with international nuclear inspections, an 
ultimatum that is likely to result in a possible military 
confrontation in the Korean peninsula. 
  Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo has expressed fears 
that the eruption of military hostilities in the divided Korean 
peninsula would deal a serious blow to Asia-Pacific economies, 
particularly the Philippines which is gearing for economic 
takeoff.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA June 4 -- Fishery in the territorial 
waters of the Truong Sa (Spratly) archipelago offshore Vietnam 
has constantly brought back great profits to local fishermen in 
the island district of Phu Quy, Binh Thuan Province. 
  In 1993, some 94 vessels of fishermen in Phu Quy Island were 
engaged in deep-sea fisheries, netting nearly 436 tonnes of 
fishes. In the first months of this year, more than 150 vessels 
with 1,200 men fished in Truong Sa. On an average in each 
fishing trip, they caught two tonnes of fish, earning 3-5 
million dong, and even more than 9 million dong on one or two 
occasions. 
  To create favourable conditions for fisheries in Truong Sa, 
the government has applied tax exemption for exploitation and 
export of sea products in the territorial waters of the 
archipelago. The authorities of Binh Thuan Province have also 
promulgated a policy on tax exemption for building deep-sea 
trawlers.

  [Text] Working-level meetings in the Japan-U.S. framework 
trade talks resumed in Tokyo on 1 June. "Theological arguments 
over definitions of terms" (as stated by a senior Foreign 
Ministry official), such as objective criteria, came to an end 
for the time being at informal negotiations held in May. 
Sectoral talks will now be held to discuss setting "objective 
criteria" to gauge foreign access to Japanese markets. However, 
there arises a possibility that the dispute between Japan and 
the United States over the meaning of objective criteria could 
further intensify, since the interests of relevant industries 
would be involved. It is still uncertain as to how much 
progress would be made in the trade talks by late June, when it 
is hoped an agreement will be reached. 
  On the day following announcement of the resumption of the 
bilateral trade talks, Walter Mondale, U.S. ambassador to Japan, 
and Tatsuro Toyoda, chairman of the Japan Automobile 
Manufacturers Association, held talks in Tokyo. Although 
details of the meeting were not disclosed, officials concerned 
believe that "prior to the resumption of the trade talks, the 
ambassador made it perfectly clear that the United States wants 
Japan to pour greater efforts into selling imported 
automobiles." They feel so all the more because in the past, 
the ambassador has questioned the Japanese marketing system, 
saying, "Only a small number of dealers in Japan handle foreign 
automobiles." 
  Automobile and auto parts trade, which accounts for a large 
portion of the Japanese trade surplus with the United States, is 
the greatest pending issue among the three priority sectors in 
the framework trade talks. Although a certain amount of 
progress has been made in the insurance and government 
procurement sectors, discussions on automobiles and auto parts, 
for the most part, are yet to reach the final stages. 
  In a lecture, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said: 
"Japan should be able to promise to increase the number of 
imported car dealers within a designated period." In reaction, 
an official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
in charge of trade negotiations complained: "This is tantamount 
to numerical targets and is beyond government control, so we 
cannot accept it." There is also a possibility that Japan may be 
pressed with new U.S. demands in the insurance and government 
procurement sectors where talks are to be held along with the 
automobiles sector. 
  Punitive measures will be in the picture when talks are held 
on five additional sectors that the United States has asked to 
have included as priority areas. Regarding sheet glass and 
forestry products, the United States hints at imposing punitive 
measures by reinstating the Super 301 provision (for determining 
and taking counteraction against unfair traders and trade 
practices) of the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act. 
Regarding intellectual property rights, the United States hints 
at imposing punitive measures under the Special 301 provision of 
the 1988 U.S. Trade Act. In the financial services sector, the 
United States is moving toward enacting by the yearend a 
legislation that will allow it to take retaliatory action 
against unfair practices. 
  Moreover, the possibility of the United States making 
further 
demands regarding macroeconomic policies has not disappeared, 
either. The U.S. Government has said that it "would praise 
Japan if it decides to implement tax cuts for three years ahead 
of tax hikes" (as stated by Lloyd Bentsen, U.S. secretary of 
treasury) to help it boost domestic demand. However, it is also 
not clear whether the ruling coalition parties would be able to 
make a final decision on a consumption tax hike in June. In 
that case, it would become difficult to extend income tax cuts 
for up to three years. 
  Japanese and U.S. leaders hope to reach accords on at least 
three of the priority sectors by the July Naples summit and use 
this as an opportunity to help stabilize their political 
steering. However, in some quarters of the industrial circles, 
which closely watch in which direction the trade talks are 
headed, there are those who feel indifferent. For example, the 
head of an industrial materials manufacturing firm has said: "In 
the end, the talks will wind up being ambiguous with decisions 
put off. The framework trade talks is a game played by 
bureaucrats and lawyers." 
  Despite such circumstances, however, a point of compromise 
must be found. Apparently, Japanese and U.S. leaders must find 
a way to break the ice, eying the possibility of making 
political decisions, while not simply letting bureaucrats take 
care of the issue.

<F P=106> [Discussion by Kyoto University Professor Emeritus Mitsuharu </F>
Ito and Tokyo University Professor Kazunori Ishiguro; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] What Is "Market Access"? 
  [Mitsuharu Ito] I've maintained for some time that economic 
problems between the United States and Japan should be settled 
through talks according to international rules. But among 
Japan's economists this view seems to be in the minority--that 
is, with the exception of Ryutaro Komiya. 
  Of course international rules are quite different from 
domestic laws and tend to carry little weight, I know. But 
that's all the more reason we have to try to follow them and 
make them more effective. I don't believe Japan has in any way 
been trying to do this recently. Rather, it has been doing the 
opposite in trying to resolve its current trade problems. 
  This was the case with regard to the semiconductor dispute 
and it is also the case this time in regard to mobile 
communications. In fact, I feel there's even a certain danger in 
the way the issue was resolved. 
  To take life insurance, for example. The United States is 
making certain demands on Japan. Americans see that foreign 
firms have a 4.2-percent share of Japan's insurance market. 
Compared to other OECD countries (excluding Japan, of course), 
this share is just too small, particularly when compared with 
the European Community countries. They want it raised to a 
two-digit figure. This is only fair, they say. 
  So, using this as proof that Japan's market is closed, they 
say we should introduce the broker system into Japan. It's a 
system we don't currently have, but it is a characteristic of 
the U.S. life insurance market. What Japan has instead is a 
system where insurance companies set up their own insurance 
agencies to represent them. In the United States, on the other 
hand, consumers go to a broker, tell him what kind of insurance 
coverage they want and ask him to find a good company to 
represent them. Based on this difference in their systems, 
Americans complain that Japan's market is closed. Therefore, 
they say there are obstacles preventing their access to Japan's 
markets. 
  This same kind of claim can be seen in recent negotiations 
between Japan and the United States over other matters. 
  I'd like to ask Mr. Ishiguro, then, what exactly does 
"market 
access" mean? 
  [Kazunori Ishiguro] "Market access" came into vogue about 
the 
mid-1980's. It's a term that still hasn't been formally defined. 
To be frank, my own personal view is that [Americans] are very 
cleverly playing on the symbolic meaning of the term to get 
[Japan] to swallow their demands and somehow think it 
understands what the term means. 
  At the Uruguay Round of GATT talks, people were speaking 
about "market access negotiations" as if everyone just naturally 
knew what was meant. But after a while, it was used to include 
so many different demands, one couldn't tell anymore what it 
meant. 
  In the life insurance example we just took up, the term was 
"equitable market access." In the case of mobile communications, 
the term people are using is "comparable market access." What 
these terms mean, in effect, is: if Japan has a 20-percent share 
of our market, then we should have a 20-percent share of Japan's 
market. It's that kind of simplistic argument. But rather than 
rebutting the other side's argument point by point on its 
theoretical merits, we cave in and make concessions. So the 
situation keeps deteriorating until we're at the point where we 
are today. 
  At the recent Uruguay Round of talks, final steps were being 
taken to create an international body, the World Trade 
Organization (WTO), to take a comprehensive approach to matters 
concerning intellectual property rights and trade in goods and 
services. As far as I'm aware, this is the first time the term 
"market access" appears in a trade agreement concerning services. 
  Services aren't the only area that will be affected, 
however. 
The entire trade issue will be affected. And what would simply 
have been negotiations to raise tariffs has been made over into 
market access talks. Japan doesn't usually catch on fully to 
that kind of subtle difference. So, the idea of market access 
has somehow gotten mixed in with the idea of nontariff barriers, 
which came out of the Tokyo Round [of GATT talks], and rather 
than just eliminating tariffs, we begin talking about 
eliminating all kinds of other barriers. Finally, the emphasis 
shifts and we're employing the concept of "market access." 
  What we have to do, I think, is look back over GATT's long 
history and with the disciplined eye of the historian and 
scholar see whether this direction was really part of the 
natural course of events and whether the argument that has been 
developed, particular the argument the Americans have developed 
(the European Community is arguing a similar position) really 
has any merits to support it. 
  Another thing. When did this argument about "unfair trade" 
develop? According to some people, it is one of the major 
principles informing the GATT agreement. But the words "fair" or 
"unfair" are never directly mentioned in the original GATT 
agreement. Article 6 of the agreement establishes certain steps 
that can be taken against violators of antidumping rules or 
against [government] subsidies, but gradually more things were 
added to expand the content of Article 6, and it came to be 
linked to debates on unfair trade. 
  Then, the differences in the various economic systems got 
emphasized and countries were told to "Americanize" their ways. 
But there were also deep-rooted reasons for countries to resist 
this "harmonization" of their respective systems, so naturally, 
it wasn't possible to change everything over to the American way. 
  Americans consider Japan its easiest target, and Japan has 
been their first line of attack. Japan doesn't understand this 
and, being solicitous toward the United States, quickly makes 
concessions. That attitude on Japan's part, wouldn't you say, 
has contributed to the present state of confusion the world is 
in. 
  I think we should approach U.S.-Japan trade problems in the 
same way we would a damage suit. If Japan just says "yes" to the 
other party's demands, no matter how unreasonable, without any 
opposition, then that means Japan agrees to accept the other 
party's demands and the case is closed. In effect, it is 
acknowledging that the other party was right. 
  What Are GATT's Principles? 
  [Ito] With regard to the differences in our systems... if we 
go back in history to the formation of the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), we'll see, just as we see in GATT's case, 
that it was right after the end of World War II, and people 
believed that their future economies would be very closely tied 
to the economies of other countries. People also reflected on 
the situation before the war. They asked themselves: could the 
sort of conflicts that arose in the past when different economic 
systems came into contact have been avoided? If so, let's create 
the kind of mechanisms that will prevent those conflicts in the 
future, they said. 
  So, what emerged is the so-called national treatment 
principle which is found in Article 3 of the GATT agreement. In 
other words, this means you extend the same freedom you extend 
to your country's own companies, citizens, and property to 
foreign companies, citizens, and property, without 
discrimination. This, I think, is one of the principles 
contained in GATT. Recently, however, this principle seems to be 
coming apart. 
  If you can imagine, there are even some Japanese theorists 
who are now following the same logic as the Americans'--namely, 
the logic that sees whatever is "American" as "universal." U.S. 
demands ignore the principle of treating foreigners in the same 
way one treats nationals--the principle established by GATT's 
founding fathers--in favor of the principle of mutuality. 
  [Ishiguro] I think there are several issues here. First of 
all, and here I'm thinking primarily of the insurance problem, 
bilateral rules haven't been established by most countries with 
regard to financial services, including insurance, and the trade 
services agreement, which was recently drawn up, still doesn't 
officially go into effect for awhile. But that agreement was 
drawn up at the Uruguay Round to move international trade in 
services as close as possible to GATT's basic principle 
regarding trade in goods. So, the "national treatment" principle 
you were talking about also becomes one of the agreement's basic 
principles. 
  GATT was set up, from a legal point of view, according to 
the 
principle of equal opportunity, which combines both the 
principles of national treatment and most-favored-nation 
treatment. 
  [Ito] "Liberalization," the term we hear so often, doesn't 
actually appear in GATT but we can find it here [in the 
principle of equal opportunity] if we look. 
  [Ishiguro] "To liberalize" means to set free of 
restrictions. 
It means affording countries an equal opportunity. Article 6, 
which I mentioned earlier, is odd given how GATT was set up on 
the basis of equal opportunity. It seems to me that the original 
intent of Article 6 has been gradually broadened until we have 
the situation we have today. 
  In GATT, we also find the idea of mutuality, which was 
mentioned. In the past, this principle was thought of in terms 
of reciprocity, or the idea of countries making mutual 
concessions with regard to tariffs. But here, too, the idea of 
mutuality changed along with the emergence of debates about 
unfair trade or the kind of results-oriented approach we find in 
demands to secure a market share. 
  I think these latest developments are wrong and we should 
return to our original point of departure. 
  Another term that is used a lot is "borderless economy." It 
doesn't necessarily mean that we will have a uniform, homogenous 
set of laws that will apply universally to every country, 
regardless of national boundaries. "Harmonization" is another 
term in popular use. But the fact that the term is used in a 
different way in Japan than it is in the United States concerns 
me very much. 
  If we are going to think about world harmony, then we should 
get to the true meaning of "harmonization." We ought to find it 
has an entirely different meaning. Compared to the efforts being 
made toward harmonization based on comparative law, Americans 
are coming from an entirely different place, with American rules 
reflecting the U.S. desire to export. I think this [difference 
in perspective] is what's behind U.S.-Japan trade frictions and 
in the background of the Uruguay Round. 
  Danger of Reverse Discrimination 
  [Ito] The term "market access" seems to me to have been very 
cleverly fabricated. It carries the nuance that consumers can 
have access to whatever goods and services they want whenever 
they want them. By drawing on that nuance, the term leaves the 
impression that an economic system without adequate market 
access isn't to the consumers' benefit. Like a conjurer, it 
seems to cast this spell over us. But it's not clear what the 
term really means. 
  Another point--the issue of what is "fair" or "unfair." When 
a foreign enterprise can't enter another country's market 
because their systems differ, I don't think the problem should 
necessarily be considered in terms of "fairness" or "unfairness." 
  The claim that something is "unfair" because of such 
differences is really a demand by latecomers to get a larger 
share of the market. It seems to me to be nothing more than a 
call for reverse discrimination. I think "reverse 
discrimination" is one of those words we'll find tucked away in 
the demand for market access. 
  [Ishiguro] Yes, just as you point out. There's very symbolic 
meaning to the fact that the concept of market access should 
have come from the area of trade in services. Systems in various 
countries differ markedly in this area. Where services are a 
government monopoly--for example, this was the case in 
communications--even nationals were excluded from the field. If 
we were to afford foreigners "national treatment"--in other 
words, if we were to treat them the same way we treat our own 
citizens--then foreigners couldn't enter the field either. Even 
with national treatment, there would be no improvement in market 
access. "Market access" in such a case, then, means forcing open 
your trading partner's market in order to get in, so the term, 
from the start, goes beyond the idea of national treatment. 
  [Ito] How is this issue being resolved in the Uruguay Round 
of talks? 
  [Ishiguro] The services trade agreement was framed in such a 
way as to recognize market access. And this became one of the 
major focuses of debate. Fortunately, Japan's young bureaucrats 
persevered in Geneva, and I think we can safely say the term, 
"market access," has been fleshed out and stripped in principle 
of the idea of numerical quotas in the final form of the accord 
proper. 
  However, in the case of financial services, a codicil of 
sorts has been added--an "article of agreement recognizing (and 
committing to) the deregulation of financial services. In 
effect, it says: Even in policies meant to be nondiscriminatory, 
reverse discrimination [preferential treatment of nonnationals 
over nationals] is sanctioned in order to recognize the entrance 
of foreign enterprises into national markets. It may become an 
issue--for example, if Japan's life insurance companies are 
unfairly discriminated against--but until that [problem] arises, 
foreigners, it says, should be given preferential treatment. 
  It's hard to believe, but after the Uruguay Round was 
concluded, the Japanese Government announced it would deregulate 
financial services based on this "article of agreement." This is 
truly to practice reverse discrimination. In short, what's in 
this article of agreement is exactly what the United States was 
demanding all along. 
  There seems to be a certain consistency in what the United 
States has been advocating. But what does this all mean for 
Japan? According to what is in the article of agreement, it 
means Japan will practice reverse discrimination. The Japanese 
Government hasn't taken a steadfast position on this point. Nor, 
to make matters worse, is it a point that has been of much 
interest to Japan's economists. 
  Concerning Mobile Phones 
  [Ito] This can really be said to be part of the U.S. 
strategic trade policy. A classic example comes to mind in the 
recent problem over mobile phones. 
  I'd like to go back over the problem to illustrate a point. 
The trouble began with the Market-Oriented Sector-Selective 
(MOSS) talks in January 1986, when Japan acceded to U.S. demands 
that it open our mobile phone market to the frequency used by 
Motorola's equipment. 
  American television, for example, uses a different frequency 
than does European television. There are about three different 
systems being used in the world. At the time of the MOSS talks, 
the United States demanded that multiple formats--the format 
used by United States, by Europe, etc.--all be made available in 
a single country, though this was something that had never been 
accomplished before. What format a country uses had been left to 
each country to decide for itself. Japan was the first to 
recognize two formats for mobile phones. Supposedly, this was to 
encourage competition and would be good for the consumer. With 
this decision, the Japanese Government then assumed the problem 
had been solved. 
  This MOSS conference was the occasion for bilateral 
negotiations between the United States and Japan. But given the 
experiences before World War II, when the logic of the strong 
prevailed in bilateral talks, the push after the war has been 
toward multilateral negotiations, and GATT has advocated the 
idea of each of the parties concerned making mutual concessions. 
This MOSS conference, however, violated that convention. 
  In April of the following year (1987), Nippon Ido Tsushin 
Corp. (IDO) set up a system to accommodate both the formats of 
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) and Motorola in the 
Tokyo area and in central Japan. Daini Denden (DDI) used 
Motorola's format in the remaining areas. NTT Docomo, on the 
other hand, set up a parallel nationwide network to accommodate 
the NTT transmission format. Since then Motorola has claimed, 
through the office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), that 
Japan has not gone far enough in opening its market and has 
continued to demand that it be allocated more frequencies and 
that additional relay stations be set up to handle calls using 
its phones. 
  In talks between Motorola and IDO, which is a private 
corporation, the latter rejected as economically unfeasible the 
idea of setting up additional relay stations for Motorola. More 
recently, however, negotiations have resulted in an acceptance 
of Motorola's demands as the result of pressure from the U.S. 
Government. Also accepted was the U.S. demand that a certain 
amount of Motorola terminal equipment be sold on Japan's market. 
In effect, what was essentially a problem between two private 
enterprises and should have been decided by the consumer in a 
free market was thus resolved in a pact between two governments, 
forcing the demands of a private enterprise to be met. 
  If Japan had ever made similar demands of the United States, 
Americans would be outraged and wouldn't even consider them 
worth discussing. 
  Specifically, in IDO's case: about 10,000 phones were using 
Motorola's format, 310,000 were equipped to accommodate NTT's 
format. One of the demands was to even these figures out. There 
are 400 relay stations that can accommodate NTT's format and 110 
which can accommodate Motorola's phone equipment. Motorola 
wanted 80 more relay stations deployed by April and another 130 
within two years. Adding this many relay stations will require 
an investment of about 30 billion yen. For Japan IDO, this is a 
huge amount of money and, I think, will be an economic hardship 
on the company. Yet, it is the government that is backing this 
disregard for the economics of the situation. 
  That's not all. While the threat of invoking Super 301 
[provisions under the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness 
Act; expired in 1990 and revived in March 1994] was forcing an 
agreement between these two private enterprises, Japan's 
minister of posts and telecommunications and the U.S. ambassador 
to Japan were giving official recognition to the agreement in 
order to elevate it to the level of a pact between the two 
governments. If this hadn't been done and the United States 
imposed sanctions against Japan through Super 301, the Japanese 
Government was afraid even if it appealed the case to GATT, 
without an existing agreement between governments, the case 
wouldn't constitute a GATT violation and Japan would lose its 
appeal. 
  [Ishiguro] From what you say, I can see that various issues 
are involved. But to jump ahead and give my conclusion, I'd say, 
if another agreement already exists in addition to the special 
pact between governments, even if Japan appeals to GATT, it's in 
a very unfavorable position. I can see it all very clearly. But 
since there are various background factors to consider, maybe we 
should go over these point by point. 
  First, I think we should begin by explaining what's strange 
about what the U.S. government is saying. On the one hand, it is 
appealing to the principle of competition and the market 
mechanism, claiming Japan must open its markets. In other words, 
it's arguing from the perspective of private enterprise. On the 
other hand, it ignores the logic of a private enterprise like 
IDO. If we want to understand the rationale behind what the 
United States is saying, I think we can find it in the idea of 
affirmative action. This is the idea, which has emerged as an 
issue within American society, that is used to secure the rights 
of ethnic minorities, Blacks, and women. Affirmative action 
presupposes a person has been discriminated against in the past. 
In the case we've been discussing, the logic behind the U.S. 
actions would be that it has been discriminated against and 
treated very badly by Japan. When there is no attempt to redress 
the situation of those victimized by discrimination, the 
argument goes, then you end up with a socially very untenable 
situation. Therefore, according to this logic, reverse 
discrimination is acceptable. 
  At the same time, according to decisions handed down by the 
U.S. Supreme Court, unless there is actual proof that a person 
has been discriminated against, this kind of reverse 
discrimination can't be recognized. This kind of proof doesn't 
exist in Japan's case. 
  So, in lieu of any proof of past discrimination, the United 
States wants the Japanese Government to hand over a document. 
Assumed implicitly in the document is the U.S. claim of past 
discrimination. And on the basis of that claim, promises are 
made in writing. And once those promises have been made, it 
becomes a pact between the two governments in which Japan 
recognizes the U.S. style of affirmative action, and reverse 
discrimination is justified. This seems to be the sort of 
argument the United States is trying to go with. Therefore, it 
would behoove the Japanese Government when sending documents 
overseas to carefully review them as if they were contracts and 
to carefully study the logic behind them. If this sort of 
"check" has been adequate, I would think Japan has a good chance 
to win its appeal when it goes before GATT, even in the 
[Motorola-IDO] case. 
  Given these assumptions, I would say Japan's biggest mistake 
was in not having gone to GATT with a case it might easily have 
won. Instead, concerned about what the United States might do, 
it settles the matter in a vague, ambiguous way. 
  [Ito] The same could be said in the case of semiconductors, 
too, can't it? 
  [Ishiguro] The logic [strategy] developed by the United 
States began around the time of the U.S.-Japan semiconductor 
accord. Thus, there's a precedent for a trade policy which tries 
to establish numerical targets. Yesterday's experience becomes 
today's truth. In the case of the semiconductor negotiations 
between the United States and Japan, one side said guarantee us 
a market share and, for some reason or another, the other side 
came up with 20 percent. It is the same with the vaguely worded 
agreement on auto parts that came out of President Bush's visit 
to Japan. 
  So there was the semiconductor accord, then the auto parts 
accord. Using these two as a springboard, the U.S. government 
then, at the recent U.S.-Japan summit meeting, urges a trade 
policy on Japan that is results-oriented and tries to establish 
numerical targets. But Japan's officials--particularly those 
from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] and 
the Ministry of Finance--have gone all-out to build a 
barrier-wall. Because the Americans can't crack the wall, they 
turn to officials at the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications who have been standing to the rear of the 
stage, and whip out their "301" hammer. And when they do, 
Japan's officials, trained by long years of tradition to react 
like Pavlov's dogs, finally end up giving in to a compromise 
agreement. 
  [Ito] Encouraged by its success with mobile phones, the 
United States is also applying its strategic trade policy to 
auto parts. Its set up numerical targets for auto parts and is 
trying to get private enterprises to buy a specified number of 
such parts. Toyota and Nissan have begun to comply. This is very 
dangerous, I think. 
  Also behind these problems is the tendency of Japan's 
bureaucrats to accommodate the other party's demands without 
officially agreeing to do so and then having their solicitude 
turned into a firm commitment. This is also the case with regard 
to auto parts. As soon as the United States sees that private 
enterprises will accommodate some of its demands, it comes with 
a request to the Japanese Government that it somehow put these 
things down in writing. I can't help feeling this is all done as 
a safeguard in the event that Japan brings the matter up before 
GATT. 
  [Ishiguro] The U.S. strategy is very simplistic. In other 
words, Americans see everything in terms of lawsuits and 
litigation. In fact, lawyers hold very important positions in 
government. It is in this sense that I have been saying 
U.S.-Japan trade disputes should be considered in the same light 
as lawsuits among companies. It is in this sense, too, that we 
shouldn't go around writing up strange letters of agreement, 
since that alone is enough to lose us our case. 
  Are Japan's Markets "Closed"? 
  [Ito] Another legal question I have is this: with whom does 
the burden of proof lie when the United States accuses Japan of 
having closed markets or of having regulations that close its 
markets off to other countries? 
  [Ishiguro] Normally, of course, the burden of proof in a 
civil suit would fall on the United States. In GATT's case, too, 
if it is a question of resolving a dispute--to take the case, 
for example, of mobile phones--the United States would state the 
nature of the problem and Japan, in turn, might argue that, as 
the result of negotiations between the two countries, the case 
boiled down to a question of "comparable market access." 
  [Ito] And the United States would then have to prove its 
claim, I guess. 
  [Ishiguro] In GATT's case, the term, "burden of proof," 
isn't 
necessarily something one customarily hears. But basically, 
that's what it boils down to. So, in the mobile phone case, 
Japan should have just sat still and waited. 
  [Ito] Yes. We should have just had the United States prove 
where and in what way Japan's markets were closed. The reason I 
say I'm in the minority is that Japan's economists take it for 
granted that Japan's markets are relatively closed in nature. 
  [Ishiguro] I can't understand that. However, in terms of 
distribution, I have a feeling that the tenor of debate has 
changed somewhat. Before, there seems to have been some scholars 
who thought Japan's distribution system was a problem. The tone 
in recent arguments, however, seems to be that Japan's system 
has its own inherent rationality. 
  [Ito] Speaking of distribution, about five years ago, an 
Italian delegation of distributors and a French delegation came 
to Japan and said our markets were about the most convenient for 
the consumer than anywhere else in the world. Objectively 
speaking, the retail industry is extremely competitive. For 
every 5 percent of the retailers who go under, another 5 percent 
enter the market. When we compare international figures on sales 
profit ratios and turnover, we certainly can't say Japan's 
markets aren't competitive. I have the feeling that 
international comparisons of this sort really aren't being made. 
  To take the example of the life insurance industry. As far 
as 
regulations are concerned, there are far more controls on the 
industry in the United States. There are also a great many state 
regulations. With land, too. The United States has a lot of 
regulations. Japan not only has fewer of them, the ones that 
exist tend to be ignored. Of course, besides the regulations 
that are explicitly written into law, the Japanese receive what 
can only be called an excessive amount of "guidance." At the 
same time, this isn't to say the fewer regulations there are, 
the better off we are. There are a lot of areas in society where 
some restrictions are necessary. 
  For example, if we climb to the top of "Sunshine City" at 
night and look down, we'll see bright, glittering neon signs of 
every color and hue. In Paris or London, there are no such 
displays. That's because there are regulations concerning neon 
signs. Some people are all in favor of relaxing regulations. But 
if city plans are drawn up without any regulations--restricting 
supermarkets or whatever--our cities would be in complete chaos. 
Necessary regulations of this kind are far too few in Japan. 
Words like "relaxing regulations" have a magic ring to them, 
they have a certain value judgment attached to them, and are 
similar in this sense to words like "market access." 
  Finally, we're told: Because Japan has such a large surplus, 
it has to meet the Americans halfway." Personally, I find this 
reasoning rather odd. But I'm in such a minority, probably no 
one other than Mr. Komiya subscribes to my view. I don't believe 
we'll find an international rule anywhere that tells the 
creditor nation it has to take steps on behalf of the debtor 
nation. The United States once took the same position, gaining 
the support of [then former] secretary of state [Cordell] Hull, 
when the IMF was being formed. It was the United States that 
rejected the idea of a creditor nation's "shared responsibility. 
It based its position on the argument for self-responsibility; 
namely, that a debtor nation should take the responsibility upon 
itself to correct its own deficit; that IMF would provide funds 
to the debtor nation during this period of adjustment, thus 
preventing any drastic adjustments from occurring; and that the 
World Bank would provide the necessary loan to enable long-term 
structural changes to take place. 
  However, the United States is now essentially talking about 
the shared responsibility of creditor nations. In reality, I 
don't think it would serve any purpose to lay the burden of 
responsibility on a creditor nation when suitable adjustments 
haven't been undertaken by the debtor country. I believe views 
like mine are definitely not in the minority among the world's 
economists. 
  In fact, a similar claim was made in a 1987 report issued by 
the U.S. President's Advisory Council. Professor Baguatei [as 
transliterated], a leading international economic theorist, is 
also saying the same thing. But since it can't reverse itself on 
its earlier claim, the United States talks instead about there 
not being sufficient market access or about our markets being 
closed, thus shifting the blame onto another country. I can't 
help but think this is the case. 
  [Ishiguro] I think that in the relationship between our 
countries--especially in regard to trade negotiations concerning 
services--there's going to be a problem agreeing on what the end 
goal for deregulation should be. In listening to the claims of 
the United States and the EC, it looks like they're going to be 
arguing that an entirely deregulated environment is the best. 
That's entirely nonsense when it comes to financial services. 
Anyone who remembers what happened with the Bank of Credit and 
Commerce International (BCCI), for example, would know that. 
  There was a time, quite awhile ago, when problems in the 
securities field were causing the general investor in Japan a 
lot of trouble, and to prevent such things from happening in the 
future, regulations here were strengthened. Every country has 
undergone a similar experience: either because of tradition or 
some development in the past, they have all at one time or 
another introduced regulations into certain areas of their 
society. To ignore such regulations entirely and argue that it's 
good to ease restrictions is just too simplistic. If we don't 
argue, first of all, how illogical such a view is, we're never 
going to resolve the issue and will end up sinking deeper and 
deeper into a quagmire. 
  Japan Should Be Consistent 
  [Ito] When [our trade] problems cut deep into the center of 
our financial sector or the auto industry and other parts of our 
economy, I don't think those in the business world are going to 
tolerate the situation any longer. I've been saying for quite 
awhile that if America is going to invoke Super 301 provisions 
against us, the earlier it's done, the better. We should appeal 
to GATT and fight such a move. Even if the United States loses, 
it probably won't back down but, again, that's all right. 
  When we look at the world economies, we have to wonder if 
developing nations can fight a powerful country like the United 
States and appeal their case to GATT should the United States 
impose Super 301 sanctions against them. The only ones powerful 
enough to fight Super 301 are the EC countries and Japan. EC has 
done it. Japan must stand firm with regard to maintaining 
fairness in world trade and supporting GATT. For example, even 
if Super 301 is imposed against us, Japan should consider that 
one of the costs of preserving certain world principles. The 
fewer victims there are, the better; the sooner this comes to 
pass, the better. This is what I've been saying. But, the ranks 
of those who fall victim are steadily growing, and the negative 
repercussions keep multiplying and spreading. 
  The United States is not the whole of the world. Of course, 
there are many things there that have universal value. At the 
same time, there are many examples from its past history where 
mistakes have been made. For example, out of its confrontational 
relationship to the president, Congress may enact legislation 
that violates international rules. The president may not apply 
the law as strictly as intended. And, in the end, Congress may 
repeal the law on its own, having recognized the error of its 
ways. 
  In this sense, American culture is still young. If Japan 
does 
not act at such times to correct the United States and its 
actions, what hope can we hold for the future of the world 
economy? Those in business and international trade and industry 
complain that academicians make such statements because they 
have no vested interest in such matters. "Think about our 
position," they say. Unfortunately, I have the feeling that over 
the past 10 years their situation has been getting worse. 
  [Ishiguro] Basically, I totally agree. Only, I think there 
are also two schools within MITI. Of the two, the 
traditionalists are solicitous of the United States and have 
made a series of concessions to the Americans. But MITI has also 
cultivated the kind of agency it takes to put out publications 
like the Industrial Structure Council's Unfair Trade 
Report. Staff has already put out the 1992 and 1993 reports 
and the 1994 edition is now being worked on. The report 
maintains that multinationalism, if carried out on the basis of 
international rules, can take us wherever we want to go. I would 
highly recommend it. 
  Finally, I would like to direct the discussion to our views 
on four basic points. First of all, I think we can say Japan's 
policy toward the United States, to put it simply, has been to 
see the world through U.S. eyes. To go a step further, the world 
has only existed for us somewhere beyond the shadows of the 
United States. We have to correct this attitude. 
  Hideo Tanaka, an eminent scholar of English and American 
law, 
among others, has said that Americans have relatively little 
interest in getting an objective, comparative view of the laws 
and regulations that exist in other countries. In other words, 
the world is up against a large yet uniquely different country 
which has a tendency to try to judge the rest of the world by 
its own standards. If Japan finds itself thinking it would like 
to join with developing countries to better the world, it will 
have to be more prepared than it is now to speak clearly and 
frankly to the United States. 
  Second, there are certain to be various occasions when Japan 
will consider appealing a matter to GATT, and the United States, 
of course, will try to get Japan's politicians to step in. The 
question is: How will our politicians respond? 
  Third, when the Motorola problem came up, for example, the 
argument was that, since it had to do with communications, it 
was the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunication's problem, but 
even within MITI, people were arguing that the problem started 
because their suggestion to ease regulations hadn't been 
followed. Self-contradictory arguments like this occurred. Then, 
the Industrial Structure Council released a document opposing 
the United States' strategic trade policy, and at the U.S.-Japan 
summit meeting that followed, a clear "no" was voiced. It seems 
rather odd considering what was happening prior to the summit. 
When the problem occurs in someone else's backyard, we brush it 
aside, saying it doesn't concern us. 
  You have reason, certainly, to feel apprehensive. This 
problem, the one which arose with regard to Motorola, is also a 
problem that affects our financial sector, it is a problem that 
affects the auto industry, and since it could occur in any other 
industry as well, it's a problem that cuts across every sector 
in our economy. We have to be strongly cognizant of this fact. 
  The final issue I'd like to bring up is Japan's mass media. 
We said "no" at the U.S.-Japan summit, and the talks were said 
to have "broken down." "To break down" is an odd phrase. It was 
natural to say "no" at the summit, and I expected more than a 
certain amount of support from our mass media people overseas. 
  In fact, when Japan said "no," it had done something it 
normally doesn't do, and it seemed the line to any future 
negotiations had been cut off. At least, that was the view of 
the media. It was then that the media people began looking for a 
scapegoat, and locking steps with the Americans, started saying 
how unusual and odd Japan's bureaucrats were. We researchers too 
were targeted. Then, concerned about what the United States 
would do, a segment of the economic community started to call 
for a compromise to be reached. 
  It was in this context that the Motorola problem emerged. As 
soon as Japan swallowed the entire set of American demands, the 
media immediately moved on to other things, as though the matter 
had been settled. This despite the fact that our young 
bureaucrats--in Washington and elsewhere--were hard at work 
trying to correct any American misapprehensions. This lack of 
consistency, is spreading its way throughout all of Japanese 
society, including the mass media, wouldn't you say? I have the 
feeling this is structurally Japan's weakest point. 
  [Ito] I think that Japan's economists, especially those who 
were educated after the war, don't view the United States in 
relative [as opposed to absolute] terms. Those before them saw 
the United States from Europe's perspective, so they understood 
the unique character and idiosyncratic elements of American 
society. The lack of such a perspective has become a weakness 
among our economists. 
  For example, consider the U.S. patent system. Is it being 
assessed in the context of international law? Americans adhere 
to the first-to-invent principle when it concerns their own 
companies, their own discoveries, their own inventors. That's 
the reason there are so many industrial secrets. Unlike Japan or 
Europe, they don't adhere to the first-to-apply principle. Yet, 
despite upholding the first-to-invent rule among their own 
enterprises, they follow the first-to-apply rule for foreign 
companies, foreign products, and foreign inventors. This is a 
violation of GATT's principle of nondiscrimination, which says 
foreigners and nationals have to be afforded the same treatment. 
  The United States is a country where its systems are always 
in a state of flux. Japan's economists don't realize that and 
are too intent on seeing its present systems as absolute, 
immutable entities. 
  I think we have to view the world with slightly more 
attention to its diversity.

  [Text] A top Foreign Ministry official disclosed on 2 June 
that the government has decided that it will ask the UN Security 
Council [UNSC] to issue a warning to the DPRK (North Korea). 
The government decided that this is how it plans to deal with 
the issue of suspected development of nuclear weapons by North 
Korea in view of the Japan-U.S.-ROK meeting to be held in 
Washington on 4 June to discuss the issue. The same official 
indicated that the Washington meeting will be held so the three 
nations can act in concert, with an eye on the UNSC meeting. He 
also pointed out that two options were available -- a resolution 
to impose sanctions or a resolution of warning against North 
Korea. Considering that the PRC would have no choice but to 
veto a resolution for imposing sanctions, the official indicated 
the government plans to ask the UNSC to issue a warning against 
North Korea. 
  So far, the UNSC has twice adopted a presidential statement 
asking North Korea to follow IAEA regulations on inspection of 
its nuclear facilities. Although a warning is different from 
sanctions, it is expected that this will be a firmer action than 
a presidential statement.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article; from NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 3 June </F>
Morning Edition] 
  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] considers the 
situation over the suspected DPRK (North Korea) nuclear arms 
program as being at "a major crossroads" (to cite Foreign 
Minister Koji Kakizawa), and thinks the next few days, up to 
early next week, will be a critical period. Vice Foreign 
Minister Kunihiko Saito, who was on an official trip overseas, 
shortened the trip and hurried home on 2 June. On 3 June, 
senior officials of the ministry will be sent to the United 
States for emergency meetings with officials of the United 
States and South Korea. 
  If North Korea continues the work of changing fuel rods at 
its experimental reactors as it is now doing, many observers 
predict it will develop into a situation of the UN Security 
Council deciding on economic sanctions. The government will 
watch what North Korea chooses to do, but in the meantime it 
will start reviewing its actions with respect to possible 
economic sanctions by the United Nations and possible 
independent actions by Japan, the United States, and South Korea. 
  Vice Minister Saito was supposed to be in the United Kingdom 
and France from 20 May to 5 June for routine policy 
consultations. But with the North Korean situation becoming 
tense, he canceled his visit to the United Kingdom and returned 
home on the afternoon of 2 June. He went directly to the 
ministry for talks with staff officials on what Japan should do. 
  The government is still unable to interpret North Korea's 
moves, and wants to decide on its course of actions after 
reading the International Atomic Energy Agency's report to the 
United Nations on the issue of the fuel rods being changed. 
Regarding the forthcoming Japan-U.S.-ROK talks, a MOFA officer 
said: "The talks are not meant for holding discussions on the 
premise of meting out sanctions." Thus he emphasized there is no 
change in the basic policy of searching for ways to solve the 
issue through dialogue with North Korea. He also added: "There 
is no new move by North Korea yet," thus also admitting that the 
possibility of finding a solution by dialogue is dimming. 
  In a meeting with Chinese diplomatic authorities on 1 June, 
the MOFA once again called on China to work on and persuade 
North Korea, but a ministry source said, "China said it would 
make efforts, but did not give a clear-cut view on such question 
as sanctions." Even when Foreign Minister Kakizawa met with 
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan on 2 June, all Tang 
did was to note the importance of solving the problem through 
dialogue. And it remains unclear how China will act in the 
United Nations. 
  Japan, the United States, and South Korea, in their talks, 
will also discuss the possibility of enforcing sanctions, on the 
assumption that North Korea will continue its rigid position. 
Since China takes a cautious stand on the question of 
sanctions, the Japanese Government is also wary, lest the 
situation develop in one big sweep into meting out sanctions. 
On the evening of 2 June, a top ministry official said: "What 
is desirable is a measure China could accept and does not need 
to exercise its veto rights on." He said that a warning should 
be issued to North Korea first, and if North Korea still does 
not soften its stance, then the nations should think about 
passing a resolution on sanctions. 
  Meanwhile, the government has also started to study what it 
should do in case the United Nations fails to pass a resolution 
on sanctions.

Edition] 
  [Text] Vienna, 2 Jun--In reference to the conclusion 
reached by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on 2 
June that effective inspection of fuel rods in experimental 
reactors has become impossible, a DPRK (North Korea) source in 
Vienna on 3 June once again insisted that the fuel rods taken 
out by North Korea are being stored in "a way to make future 
IAEA inspections possible." 
  The North Korean source said the IAEA was informed of this 
in 
a letter dated 2 June.

  [Text] On 2 June, a government source said that next week 
the government will hold a meeting of its informal consultative 
body, the "joint information council," on the alleged nuclear 
development by the DPRK (North Korea). The objective of the 
meeting is to discuss measures for coping with growing 
international tension over the North Korean issue. The North 
Korean situation has worsened since the UN Security Council's 
presidential statement urging North Korea's early acceptance of 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- 
made in response to the nation's attempt to hastily replace fuel 
rods used in its nuclear facilities. 
  The council was established in 1986 under the then Nakasone 
cabinet to reinforce the crisis management capability of the 
nation. The council is chaired by the (administrative) deputy 
chief cabinet secretary, and members include directors of the 
Foreign Ministry's International Information Bureau, the Defense 
Agency's Defense Policy Bureau, the National Police Agency's 
Security Bureau, the Cabinet Information Research Office, and 
the Cabinet Security Affairs Office, as well as the deputy 
director general of the Public Security Investigation Agency.

  [Text] On 1 June, the government conveyed its intention to 
the DPRK that Japan is ready to give economic aid to it through 
international organizations even before normalizing its 
diplomatic ties with the DPRK should the DPRK diplomatically 
settle the nuclear issue by returning to the nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and accepting the International 
Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) nuclear inspections. This has 
been disclosed by a government source. 
  After explaining its intention to the United States, the 
Japanese Government informed the DPRK of the plan through the 
U.S.-DPRK working-level meeting. Japan explained only its 
fundamental policy and did not touch on details of the economic 
aid. However, it is assumed that Japan can provide support in 
such areas as development of light-water reactors, development 
of the Tumen River, and increasing urgently needed food 
production. 
  Moreover, the government named the UN Development Programme 
(UNDP), the IAEA, and other organizations as possible agencies 
through which the economic aid will be given. However, the 
government is also taking into consideration the possibility of 
having relevant nations and organizations, including the United 
States, the ROK, and the World Bank, form support groups. 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said that "North Korea is a 
country which went through unbearable sufferings and griefs 
during Japan's colonization." From this viewpoint, the 
government, in an effort to normalize its diplomatic ties with 
the DPRK, plans to give full- scale economic aid to it, in the 
same way as Japan did to the ROK when both countries normalized 
their diplomatic ties, by signing an accord on the right of 
claim [seikyuken] and economic cooperation. 
  It seems that the government, by implementing aforesaid 
government policy at an early date, firmed up a plan to 
partially provide economic aid to the DPRK prior to normalizing 
diplomatic ties because of its intention to urge, by using the 
economic aid as a pump-priming measure, the DPRK to settle the 
nuclear issue through diplomatic channels and to open up its 
doors to other countries. 
  However, it is "difficult to give bilateral support" to 
North 
Korea before normalizing ties with the DPRK, according to a 
government source. Therefore, the government came up with the 
concept of providing aid by having international organizations 
and relevant countries and agencies form support groups. 
  Moreover, regarding normalization of diplomatic ties between 
Japan and the DPRK, the government is also studying the 
possibility of establishing diplomatic ties after recognizing 
the DPRK as a nation and reaching an agreement to hold 
negotiations to normalize relations.

  [Text] In a bid to win China's cooperation in dealing with 
the issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear 
arms, the government reaffirmed on 3 June to seek a moderate 
step like a resolution warning or criticizing North Korea in the 
UN Security Council. The government reaffirmed to seek the 
moderate step based on its perception that China's cooperation 
is indispensable for the UN Security Council to take effective 
measures against North Korea, and "North Korea's unclear issue 
has now become an issue, the resolution of which depends on 
China" (according to a Foreign Ministry source). 
  The government, however, analyzes that the United States may 
seek a resolution imposing economic sanctions against North 
Korea in the UN Security Council out of irritation and 
disappointment with the recent situation. The government's 
judgment is that Japan has no choice but to enforce economic 
sanctions in concert with the United States if they are imposed. 
  The government has sent Shunji Yanai, chief of the Foreign 
Policy Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, to Washington to attend 
emergency tripartite talks to be held by officials from Japan, 
the United States, and South Korea. During the talks, the 
officials will examine a draft of a resolution to be adopted by 
the UN Security Council and to be acceptable to China. Will the 
three nations seek a resolution criticizing North Korea in the 
UN Security Council or will they seek a resolution hinting at 
additional actions, including the imposition of economic 
sanctions against North Korea, in the UN Security Council? The 
three nations are likely to discuss details of concrete measures 
against North Korea while watching how China is moving. 
  Japan-U.S. talks, U.S.-South Korea talks, and the 
Japan-U.S.-ROK tripartite talks are planned to be held. In 
addition to those talks, there is a high possibility that the 
three nations will hold their individual talks with China. 
Presently under study is Japan's proposal that special 
inspections should be conducted at two nuclear facilities that 
North Korea has yet to declare to the International Atomic 
Energy Agency in a bid to break the deadlock over the issue of 
North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons. 
  Administrative Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito, who 
returned home hurriedly on 2 June from his foreign trip, has met 
separately with Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the opposition 
Social Democratic Party of Japan, and Ryutaro Hashimoto, 
chairman of the Policy Research Council of the opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party. During the meetings, Saito said: 
"Japan plans to buy time by seeking a resolution criticizing 
North Korea. The United States may ask Japan to support its 
proposal for the economic sanctions against North Korea. I 
instructed Yanai, chief of the Foreign Policy Bureau, before he 
was sent to Washington to go along with the U.S. proposal if the 
U.S. side asks the Japanese side to support the proposal at the 
talks."

  [Text] The government has firmed up its plan of action in 
the event sanctions are imposed against North Korea [DPRK] over 
the issue of its suspected nuclear arms development program. 
  The plan is comprised of three major components: "control of 
personnel exchanges," which bans visits and entries by Japanese 
and DPRK Government officials into each other's countries, and 
"control on academic and cultural exchanges"; "a ban on trade 
and capital transactions"; and "control on commodities and 
money." These plans will be readjusted during tripartite talks 
with the United States and South Korea, which begin in 
Washington on 4 June. 
  The government will first watch to see if sanctions are 
imposed at all, and, if they are, whether they are a result of a 
UN Security Council resolution or a unilateral judgment by the 
three nations of Japan, the United States, and the ROK. 
Depending on which course of action is taken, the government 
will decide on specific actions to be taken. 
  According to the government plan, actions under the "control 
on personnel exchanges" include: 1) restrictions of contacts 
between diplomats [from Japan and the DPRK] in third countries; 
2) a ban, in principle, on visits to the DPRK by Japanese 
Government officials; 3) a ban on entry into the country by DPRK 
Government officials, and a tightened review of [DPRK] 
civilians' entry applications; and 4) a ban on special airplane 
flights between Japan and the DPRK. Measures under the "control 
on academic and cultural exchanges" include: 1) a ban on 
importing, exporting, and brokered trade; 2) suspension of 
investment, loans, and other types of capital transactions; and 
3) restrictions on means of remittances into or out of [the 
DPRK]. This means the "suspension of remittances" requested by 
the United States is included in the actions. 
  However, from the humanitarian viewpoint, Korean residents 
reentering Japan after visiting the DPRK are not included in the 
ban.

  [Text] As attention is focusing on the issue of 
remittances to North Korea by ethnic Koreans residing in Japan, 
Japanese banks are in a dilemma. Some Japanese banks, including 
the Ashikaga Bank, which are said to have been handling direct 
remittances to North Korea by ethnic Koreans in Japan, appear to 
be increasingly concerned about UN moves to impose economic 
sanctions against North Korea. 
  According to a financial source, 18 Japanese banks, 
including 
city banks, have concluded correspondence agreements with the 
Korea Trade Bank and other North Korean banks. North Korea had 
delayed payments since 1975, and a Western consortium declared 
North Korea insolvent in 1987, prompting a majority of the 
Japanese banks with correspondence agreements with North Korean 
banks to halt financial transactions. The Japanese banks have 
since entrusted the Ashikaga Bank to handle remittance requests 
from their customers. 
  The Ashikaga Bank is a joint-venture bank that was 
established by North Korea and [pro-North Korea] ethnic Koreans 
residing in Japan and the bank with a long history of banking 
transactions with North Korea still maintains its correspondence 
agreement with North Korean banks. The bank, however, has 
suspended the handling of dollar-denominated remittance requests 
from other Japanese banks to North Korea since last April. 
According to the same financial source, "the bank has handled 
almost no dollar-denominated remittances to North Korea and the 
bank's decision to suspend dollar-denominated remittances to 
North Korea has had little impact on the total remittances by 
ethnic Koreans in Japan to North Korea." If all the remittances 
by ethnic Koreans in Japan to North Korea are halted, however, 
its impact would be more extensive, and the ethnic Koreans 
residing in Japan are expected to react against the halt.

  [Text] On 3 June, a survey by the Ministry of Finance 
indicated that Japan's direct investment in DPRK (North Korea) 
recorded zero both on project and money basis in fiscal 1993. 
Japan's investment in North Korea had continued since 1967 or 
immediately after the latter lifted a ban on acceptance of 
foreign investment. The investment indicated even a tendency of 
a little increase in recent years. There have been so far 18 
projects of direct investment in North Korea, totaling $35.609 
million. The investment reached a peak in fiscal 1988 when 
there were seven projects totaling $12.62 million. In fiscal 
1992, there was one investment project amounting to $4.29 
million. Investment was made mainly in such industries as 
textile and timber.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is increasingly 
becoming irritated. It is possible that some government 
officials may assume a hardline stand over North Korea's 
suspected nuclear weapons development and that policy gap 
between the government and the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] will deepen, and that it may become even more difficult 
for the SDPJ to return to the government if people begin to talk 
about economic sanctions against the DPRK before the United 
Nations actually arrives at a decision on the issue. The fact 
that the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is trying to force Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai, who is the prime minister's 
right-hand man, to resign on the issue of "manipulated Diet 
questioning" is also irritating the prime minister. Since the 
minority government's touch-and-go business in steering the 
political situation is continuing, we cannot wipe out the 
apprehension that "even one mistake will become fatal to the 
cabinet." 
  "The mass media is too exited. I am coolly dealing with the 
situation." He made this complaint in an interview with 
journalist Tetsuya Chikushi on the evening of 3 June at his 
official residence. After the interview, Hata emphatically 
explained to a group of reporters that, "We will keep our doors 
open all the time to have discussions. We are still not in the 
stage of imposing economic sanctions against the DPRK. We 
should not drive the DPRK into a tight corner." In response to 
a question asked by a reporter whether Japan should deal with 
the North Korean issue by adopting the strategy of the North 
Wind or the Sun in Aesop's Fables, Hata positively 
said "the Sun." 
  Those close to the prime minister say that what irritate him 
on the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons 
development is that "there are growing voices within the cabinet 
and the Foreign Ministry calling for adopting a hardline 
position" against the government's will. For example, Foreign 
Minister Kakizawa said at a session of Committee on Foreign 
Affairs of the House of Representatives on 3 June that 
controlling remittances to North Korea by Korean residents in 
Japan and suspending trade with North Korea can be considered as 
a possible sanction measure by Japan. It is said that since the 
prime minister, in hopes of having the SDPJ return to the 
coalition, has so far stressed the "importance of settling the 
issue of North Korea through dialogue," he is concerned about 
the SDPJ's possible objection to Foreign Minister Kakizawa's 
remarks. 
  The prime minister is also nervous about the suspicion that 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai asked Issei Inoue of the SDPJ to 
bring up in the Diet a document criticizing Masahisa Naito, 
former chief of Industrial Policy Bureau of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI], in an apparent attempt 
to force Naito to quit. Because of the introduction of this 
issue, the budget committee session of the House of 
Representatives was suspended on the afternoon of 2 June, and 
the time of the prime minister's scheduled meeting with a 
visiting high-ranking Chinese official was changed and 
shortened. The prime minister, dissatisfied with the 
opposition's pursuit of the issue that changed and shortened the 
schedule of his meeting, said "there is something wrong with 
this country." But this remark has invited the LDP's harsh 
criticism, thus eventually helping the LDP step up the offensive 
against the Hata cabinet. For this reason, the prime minister 
seems to be puzzled over how to manage the Diet. 
  Since the Hata cabinet will suffer a serious blow if Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Kumagai should be forced to resign following 
former Justice Minister Nagano, the prime minister's irritation 
will likely grow in the face of the Diet summoning former MITI 
Industrial Policy Bureau Chief Naito as unsworn witness on 6 
June.

  [Text] On the evening of 5 June, Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata commented on the trilateral discussions among Japan, the 
United States, and the ROK on the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected 
development of nuclear weapons. He said: "Japan needs to watch 
future developments calmly," indicating he intends to maintain a 
wait-and-see attitude. 
  He also said: "North Korea's statements are quite elusive 
[bimyo]. It seems to want to continue dialogue with the United 
States," giving his opinion that North Korea is still searching 
for a solution through talks with the United States. 
  The prime minister gave the above remarks in response to 
questions from reporters at his official residence.

  [Text] Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the opposition 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], held a news conference 
at a hotel in Hachinohe City, Aomori Prefecture, on 4 June. 
During the news conference, he touched on the issue of imposing 
economic sanctions against North Korea for its suspected 
development of nuclear weapons and stated: "At a time when the 
United Nations has yet to make any decision, Japan, the United 
States, and South Korea must be cautious about the economic 
sanctions against North Korea. The SDPJ takes a position against 
the economic sanctions on North Korea." In this way, Kubo made 
it clear that the SDPJ will oppose any economic sanctions 
imposed by Japan, the United States, and South Korea against 
North Korea. During the news conference, Kubo also said that, 
through an SDPJ delegation which is scheduled to leave Japan for 
Pyongyang on 10 June, the party intends to urge North Korea to 
accept nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] and hold dialogue with the United States and South 
Korea.

  [Text] At a time when international tensions are mounting 
over the issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear 
weapons, the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the 
opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] plan to send 
their respective delegations to North Korea in June. They plan 
to send their delegations with the aim of "opening the way for a 
dialogue between Japan and North Korea through parliamentary 
diplomacy" since no governmental contacts between the two 
countries have been made since the Japan-North Korea 
normalization talks were broken off. While some officials in the 
government and some members in the two parties are concerned 
about sending the delegations to North Korea, saying, "Their 
visits to North Korea would be exploited by North Korean 
propaganda, thereby incurring a backlash from the United 
States," others are pessimistic about their visits to North 
Korea, saying, "Since it is a delicate time, North Koreans will 
guard against the delegations." 
  The LDP will send Taku Yamasaki, former director general of 
the Defense Agency, and Yoichi Tani, former director general of 
the Hokkaido and Okinawa Development Agency, on 14 June to 
Pyongyang. 
  They hope to hold talks with North Korean Premier Kang 
Song-san, but their itinerary has yet to be decided. Yamasaki 
says, "If the talks are held, we would tell the premier that 
North Korea needs to clear up suspicions over North Korea's 
development of nuclear arms through consultations with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)." 
  North Korea has accepted Yamasaki's visit to North Korea. 
Commenting on North Korea's acceptance of this visit, a senior 
LDP member sees the acceptance as "North Korea's signal that it 
hopes to improve relations with Japan." Another senior LDP 
member, however, says: "There is a question of whether their 
visit to North Korea is timely or not. They may merely listen to 
what North Koreans advocate without advocating anything to them." 
  The SDPJ will send Hajime Fukada, director general of the 
Organization Bureau, and others to Pyongyang on 11 June and they 
will stay there until 14 June. The SDPJ delegation is likely to 
be composed of three peorsons. The SDPJ views their visit to 
North Korea as an opportunity to lay the groundwork for a visit 
by a party delegation led by chairman or secretary general to 
North Korea. The SDPJ delegation intends to avoid making any 
proposal to break the deadlock over the nuclear issue.

<F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 4 June Evening Edition] </F>
  [Text] On 4 June, Defense Agency [DA] sources commented on 
reports that the DPRK (North Korea) plans to conduct a ballistic 
missile-launching test, and said according to analysis conducted 
by the DA and the Self-Defense Forces, the possibility of the 
DPRK conducting the test is less than 50 percent. It was also 
learned that, since May 1993, the DPRK has conducted two or 
three preparations for ballistic missile test launches, but did 
not actually conduct the tests. 
  According to DA officials, the ballistic missile the DPRK 
wants to test-fire is thought to be the Nodong-1, which has a 
firing range of about 1,000 km. The official said it is highly 
likely that the missile is the same type as the one fired at the 
end of May last year. 
  The officials noted: 1) it has been confirmed that the DPRK 
has been prepared to test-fire Nodong missiles two to three 
times since the time of the test in May of last year, but did 
not actually perform the tests; and 2) though, no doubt, the 
DPRK is getting ready for another test launching, it will 
probably not go so far as to carry it out now, when tensions are 
high over the issue of that country going ahead with changing 
nuclear reactor fuel rods.

  [Text] The DPRK (North Korea) is reportedly preparing to 
test-fire a ballistic missile. Commenting on timing of the test, 
a senior official in the Defense Agency [DA] has said, "Moves by 
North Korean Navy ships near a sea area where the ballistic 
missile is expected to hit holds the key to determining the 
timing of its test-firing." The same official noted the DA will 
do everything it can to collect information on North Korea's 
test on the basis of information provided by the U.S. Forces in 
Japan. 
  The same DA senior official also said: "If North Korea is to 
test-fire the ballistic missile not as a simple bluff, but for a 
purely technical experiment, it is supposed to keep a variety of 
information, such as electronics information and coded signals, 
from being collected by other nations. We will have to position 
our ships near the sea area where the ballistic missile is 
expected to hit." 
  North Korea test-fired "Nodong-1" missile on 29 May 1933. 
The 
DA confirmed that at the time North Korean Navy ships were 
positioned near an area in the Sea of Japan where the missile 
hit to collect information. With regard to the question of 
determining when North Korea will test-fire the missile, the DA 
has said: "North Korea is now suffering from a fuel shortage and 
the country is expected to position its Navy ships only a day or 
two prior to the test-firing. Once North Korean Navy ships begin 
moving out in the Sea of Japan, we can conclude that North Korea 
will soon test-fire the missile." The DA is now collecting 
information and has put itself on a state of alert while 
analyzing the information provided by the U.S. Forces in Japan.

  [Text] Full details have emerged on the items that the 
European Union (EU) has demanded that the Japanese Government 
deregulate. There are 32 items in all, including: 1) revising 
the current Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law, 
which restricts direct investment by foreign corporations in 
some areas of business to make corporate acquisition in Japan 
easier; 2) introducing a permit system for mutual acceptance of 
foreign inspection standards for electronic equipment and to 
promote imports; and 3) expanding the access of foreign capital 
to pension operations. Demands on deregulation in the area of 
finance are nearly the same as those from the United States. On 
31 May the Japanese Government and the EU began a working-level 
exchange of views regarding the demands. 
  The 32 items of the EU's demands were classified into five 
areas -- investment promotion, information and communications, 
import promotion, market liberalization, and distribution. The 
EU and the Japanese Government are supposed to exchange views on 
them item by item in order to probe for points of compromise, 
and on 31 May, five government agencies concerned -- the 
Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, 
the Economic Planning Agency, and the Management and 
Coordination Agency -- conducted negotiations with officials of 
the EU individually. The Japanese Government wants to 
incorporate what are agreed in the discussions into the 
deregulation plans to be formulated by the end of June. 
  Regarding corporate acquisitions, the EU is demanding the 
amendment of the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law, 
which is viewed as "granting a veto over the acquisition of 
Japanese corporations by foreign corporations." The law at 
present provides that foreign corporations making direct 
investments in Japan can do so in most areas of business by 
making ex-post-facto reports but must file advance reports for 
government review and approval in four particular industries: 
oil, agriculture, leather, and mining. The EU considers the 
exceptional measures on these four areas of industry as barriers 
to investments. 
  For import promotion, the EU wants the standards and permits 
for electric equipment mutually recognized between Japan and the 
EU, thus saving time taken in import inspections and enabling 
the EU-approved product specifications to be accepted by Japan 
automatically. In addition, the EU requests simplification of 
import inspection procedures for television sets and video 
cassette recorders. With respect to customs service, the EU 
seeks reduced commission rates, simplification of quarantine 
procedures, and 24-hour customs office operations of major 
seaports and airports. 
  Its demand in the financial field is the same as that of the 
United States--the easing of rules on pension operations. 
Whereas at present only the trust banks and life insurance 
companies are allowed to deal with public pensions (welfare 
pensions and national pensions), the EU requests that Japan open 
this business to investment consulting companies. The scale of 
public pensions in operation ran to about 20 trillion yen at the 
end of 1993, and European and U.S. investment consulting 
companies have been raising their voices to demand that Japan 
open this area to them. 
  Regarding pensions, the EU wants Japan to ease the 
regulation 
on ceilings which are put on the amount of money used on 
operations of private businesses' pensions, and to raise the 
ceilings.

<F P=106> ["Gist of the Draft Guidelines on Deregulation Compiled by a </F>
Subcommittee of the Ruling Coalition's Tax Reform Council"] 
  [Text] The administrative and fiscal reform subcommittee 
of the ruling coalition's Tax Reform Council has issued 
guidelines on 33 deregulatory measures. The essential points of 
the guidelines follow: 
<H5>  National Police Agency </H5>
1. A wider range of application for the ordinary driver's 
license -- regulations should be revised so that vehicles 
weighing less than 10 tons and carrying less than five tons of 
payload will be considered "ordinary cars." 
<H5>  Ministry of Transport </H5>
  1. Revision of the method under which passenger fares are 
fixed by railway enterprises -- a ceiling should be set on 
passenger fares, while the existing method should be improved. 
  2. Relaxation of regulations on railway freight charges 
(details are omitted). 
  3. Drastic revision of the tonnage adjustment system that is 
applied to coastal shipping vessels (details are omitted). 
  4. Deregulation concerning the trucking industry -- the 
ministry should increase the number of expanded operations 
areas. In the end, each operations area should be expanded so 
that it will correspond to each administrative district covered 
by each local transport bureau. 
<H5>  Ministry of International Trade and Industry </H5>
  1. Phased abolition of the Large-Scale Retail Store Law -- 
the ministry should define the abrogation program, for example, 
the law can be abolished by gradually raising the upper limit on 
floor space for outlets not needing government approval. 
  2. Relaxation of the Electric Appliance and Material Control 
Law -- the ministry should further promote harmonization with 
such foreign standards as IEC (international standard) and UL 
(U.S. standard). It should also encourage the reconversion of 
electrical appliances and materials classified under Group A to 
those classified under Group B, while relaxing the obligation to 
obtain type certification for electrical appliances and 
materials still falling under Group A. 
  3. Regulations on foreign investment in Japan and its 
application -- as for industries that directly affect national 
security, many of them are not mentioned clearly by reason of 
the Foreign Exchange Law. This should be revised, because it 
lacks clarity. 
<H5>  Fair Trade Commission </H5>
  1. Revision of regulations prohibiting the establishment of 
holding companies (details are omitted). 
<H5>  Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries </H5>
  1. Relaxation of conditions for obtaining a license to sell 
rice retail -- in principle, the ministry should grant a license 
to every capable retailer eager to sell rice. 
  2. Drastic revision of regulations on farmland -- the 
ministry should review city planning and revise its agricultural 
development program. It should promote the use of underutilized 
lands located in urbanized areas. Concerning the right to 
authorize the conversion of farmland covering a total area of 
more than two hectares, the ministry will place the matter under 
the authority of prefectural governors. As for cities meeting 
certain requirements that include population size, the ministry 
will also entrust the matter to the municipal authorities. 
  3. Introduction of a selective system to limit rice acreage 
-- the ministry should implement a new system under which rice 
farmers will have free choice as to whether they will continue 
to operate under the government's umbrella in accordance with 
the production adjustment policy, after due consideration of 
such factors as market pricing and production cost. 
  4. Encouragement of direct sales by rice farmers to 
consumers 
(details are omitted). 
  5. Reduction of the government purchasing price and the 
government selling price of rice -- the ministry will help cut 
the average production cost by half in about 10 years. 
  6. Reduction of the government purchasing price and the 
government selling price of wheat (details are omitted). 
  7. Reform in the pricing process of rice authorized for free 
distribution -- the ministry should increase the volume of rice 
authorized for free distribution, offer more bids for such rice, 
relax measures aimed at curbing excessive price fluctuations, 
and promote diversification of rice sellers and buyers. 
  8. Reduction of subsidies connected with raw sugar imports 
(details are omitted). 
  9. Revision of import restrictions on wheat and barley for 
use as feedstuff (details are omitted). 
<H5>  Ministry of Finance </H5>
  1 Further relaxation of conditions for obtaining a license 
for retail sale of liquor--the ministry will grant a license to 
every retailer considered to be capable of dealing in liquor on 
his own responsibility. However, for the moment, the ministry 
will first authorize retail stores having floor space of more 
than 3,000 square meters. It will also shorten the period 
during which sales of alcoholic beverages will be restricted so 
that retailers will be able to sell any kind of liquor as soon 
as they start their business. 
  2. Further relaxation of conditions for obtaining a license 
for retail sale of cigarettes (details are omitted). 
  3. Reduction to 5 percent of the withholding tax rate 
applied 
to stock dividends paid to foreign parent companies. The 
government will ask pertinent countries for revision of the tax 
treaty, while it will voluntarily lower the tax rate to 5 
percent regardless of negotiations to revise the treaty. 
<H5>  Ministry of Health and Welfare </H5>
  1. Relaxation of criteria for obtaining a license for retail 
sale of medicines -- designated inspection institutions will 
take care of a wider area covering several prefectures. In 
principle, inspection equipment will no longer have to be set up 
inside a drugstore. 
  2. Plant quarantine -- to remove barriers impeding food 
exports, the ministry will define the medical inspection 
process, stop holding public hearings, and remove the 
zero-tolerance requirement. 
<H5>  Ministry of Construction </H5>
  1. Revision of the essential points mentioned in the 
administrative guidance concerning development projects (details 
are omitted). 
  2. Amplification of assistance by the Housing Loan 
Corporation concerning the purchase of houses with a leasehold 
on land. The Corporation will accommodate people with loans to 
enable them to buy such houses and to pay key money to 
landowners. 
  3. Simplification of the approval process for imported 
construction materials that already meet foreign standard 
requirements (details are omitted). 
<H5>  National Land Agency </H5>
  1. Relaxation or cancellation of supervision over specific 
areas -- local governments should stop supervising designated 
areas when there is no more danger of a sudden rise in land 
prices. 
<H5>  Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications </H5>
  1. Relaxation of regulations concerning the launching of a 
new telecommunications business classified under the first 
category [category of common carriers], or the withdrawal from 
such a business. The ministry should abolish, or if not, 
revise, the provision on supply-demand adjustment, and implement 
impartial and clear criteria in exchange. 
  2. As for telecommunications companies that come under the 
first category, fewer services (rates) will be subject to 
government approval. Only services that deeply affect the 
national economy or people's everyday life will be subject to 
approval. 
  3. Promotion of the open network program -- the ministry 
should implement the principle of the open network agreement to 
help realize the hookup of different telecommunications networks 
under fair conditions. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone 
Corporation (NTT) should further open its network to other 
telecommunications companies. 
  4. Measures to cope with the fusion of the communications 
industry and the broadcasting industry (details are omitted). 
  5. Revision of the standard certification system regarding 
the certification of telecommunications equipment -- the 
ministry should reduce the certification fee and simplify and 
accelerate the application procedure. It should also gradually 
integrate government offices where applications are sent. 
<H5>  Other Deregulatory Measures </H5>
  1. Revision of the government procurement system -- an 
information system should be created to give equal opportunities 
to foreign-affiliated companies. As for the advance 
registration system, the government will take necessary steps so 
that foreign-affiliated companies will have to register their 
name only once.

  [Text] Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), which had 
applied for rate hikes averaging 18 percent on the basic charge 
and additional hikes on the information call rate, reveals an 
increased sense of crisis as it says, "If expected rate 
increases are not approved in the fall, financial results for 
this fiscal year will be fairly bad." 
  The operating program for fiscal year 1994, submitted for 
approval at the end of February, projected recurring profits of 
104 billion yen. The figure did not include the requested rate 
hikes, making them little changed from the 106 billion yen in 
recurring profits expected for fiscal year 1993. However, 
inclusion of a special charge to cover voluntary retirements 
will drop aftertax profits for fiscal year 1995 to 61 billion 
yen. Since maintaining a 10-percent dividend payout rate will 
require 78 billion yen, profits retained from fiscal year 1993 
will have to be used to cover dividend payments. 
  NTT revised its new subscriber estimates for fiscal year 
1993 
from the initial 1.3 million connections to 1.2 million and 
there is a strong possibility that it will revise downward as 
well its fiscal year 1994 estimate of 1.2 million. Telephone 
call revenues fell by 130 billion yen in fiscal year 1993 from 
the prior year and are expected to drop another 90 billion yen 
in fiscal year 1994, because long-distance call rates were 
reduced to compete with the new common carriers. 
  President Hitoshi Kojima makes no attempt at concealing his 
disappointment, asserting that NTT's applications for rate hikes 
were "unavoidable measures after a series of cost-reduction 
actions and reductions in long-distance call rates. We would 
hope that our rate hike application will not be treated in the 
same manner as other public utility rate increases." 
  Sources at the Telecommunications Bureau of the MOPT say, 
"We 
cannot conceive of NTT falling victim to deficits immediately, 
but there is the potential of having difficulty maintaining the 
current dividend rate or the fear of delaying improvements in 
infrastructure such as the installation of optical fiber cables.

  [Text] On 26 May, three international communications 
carriers announced their earnings reports for the fiscal year 
ending in March 1994. Despite languishing economic trends, the 
three international carriers experienced steady growth in demand 
for their services accompanied by increased revenues and 
profits. International Digital Communications (IDC; Daito ward, 
Tokyo; Katsuto Orihata, president) recorded recurring profits 
for the first time since establishment of the firm. All of the 
firms attribute their favorable results to increased use of 
communications linked with Asia as a whole, including China. 
  Of total revenues, the portion attributable to telephone 
toll 
charges was 192.7 billion yen, a 5.1-percent increase over the 
prior year, for Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD); 41.529 billion yen, 
a 29.3-perecent increase, for IDC; and 38.902 billion yen, a 
23.7-percent increase, for International Telecommunication of 
Japan (ITJ; Chuo ward, Tokyo; Hiroshi Ohara, president). 
  At the beginning of the year, initial estimates forecast 
growth of 9 percent for international communications demand for 
Japan as a whole, but it appears that growth of 
telecommunications linked with Asia grew at a rate in excess of 
10 percent. Sources at KDD say, "China-related demand grew in 
the mid-30-percent range and Philippines-related demand grew 12 
percent," with similar sharp increases experienced by all of the 
firms in relation to China, the Philippines, and South Korea, 
second only to the traffic recorded with the United States. It 
appears that the trend is backed up by increasing travel to 
Japan and rising commercial operations in Asia by Japanese firms. 
  Capital investments totaled 45 billion yen for KDD, 9.6 
billion yen for IDC, and 14.2 billion yen for ITJ, reflecting a 
decline from recent years because of the absence of major 
capital investments involving construction of international 
marine cable links.

  [Text] Regional telephone company Tokyo Tsushin Network 
(TTNet, Minato ward, Tokyo) is going to invest in the leading 
Tokyo CATV [cable television] company Cable Television Tokyo 
(Minato ward, Tokyo; Makoto Ujigawa, president). The investment 
is expected to represent about 3 percent of Cable Television 
Tokyo's capitalization in the amount of 100 million yen. This 
will be the first time that a telephone company invests in a 
CATV station, since the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications 
[MOPT] in December 1993 launched a policy to "promote 
participation in communications operations by CATV firms." TTNet 
plans to use this opportunity to invest in CATV firms in various 
regions and expand its telephone network. It appears that CATV 
and telephone companies will increasingly engage in capital and 
business affiliations as we see progress in the integration of 
broadcasting and communications. 
  Cable Television Tokyo's operating area covers Minato ward, 
Tokyo, and services just under 10,000 households. Because of 
slow progress in enlisting new subscribers, it is expected to 
continue losing money until fiscal year 1995. On the other hand, 
in response to deregulation measures taken by the MOPT at the 
end of 1993, it is currently considering augmenting operations 
to include expansion to other areas and integrated broadcasting 
and communications services such as home shopping using the CATV 
system. 
  On the other hand, TTNet is a Tokyo Electric Power 
Company-affiliated communications company and operates in the 
Kanto area. TTNet was also considering participation in 
communications services linking CATV stations in response to 
deregulation, enabling compatibility of interests between the 
two companies. 
  TTNet plans to use the tie-up with Cable Television Tokyo as 
the first step in investing and affiliating itself with other 
CATV stations throughout the Kanto region and to set up a 
communication network that rivals NTT's urban telephone system. 
TTNet explains, "CATV companies are having difficulty raising 
the capital needed to invest in the installation of cables; we 
would like to assist in this respect." 
  A number of major capital and business affiliations are 
being 
formed between U.S. regional telephone companies and major CATV 
stations in connection with the integration of broadcasting and 
communications services. In the past, in Japan, the concept of 
broadcasting and communications being separate businesses 
persisted in both government and the private sector and 
integration of the two businesses made no progress. In the 
future, we can expect progress in the integration of CATV and 
telephone companies.

<F P=106> [By securities division reporter Shuko Sadamoto] </F>
  [Text] City banks are rushing to implement changes in 
bond-trading strategy for clients in preparation for setting up 
securities subsidiaries. Such action is being taken because of 
banks' inevitable dependence on profits from bond trading for a 
while even after establishment of subsidiaries and the 
prerequisite to secure a comprehensive customer base in order to 
ensure success in underwriting, which the banks see as a 
potentially lucrative area. Moves to strengthen the bond sales 
force are being taken aggressively by expanding formerly 
understaffed sales staff handling government-secured bonds and 
local government bonds and aggressively pursuing sales to small 
and midsized regional financial institutions. 
  A bond trader at a major securities firm testifies, 
"Formerly, most city banks would not consider approaching small 
and midsized financial institutions, but recently they have gone 
on a sales offensive and have succeeded in taking away our 
clients." City banks have already embarked on the steady 
building of an operating base even before establishing 
securities subsidiaries. 
  Securities subsidiaries will be able to handle trading in 
bonds such as corporate bonds, Euroyen bonds, and 
interest-bearing financial institution bonds, which are not 
handled by banks. However, these ordinary bonds, unlike 
government bonds, are issued in small quantities and are thinly 
traded and city banks will sell most of these bonds to small and 
midsized regional financial institutions with whom they had only 
limited dealings in the past. 
  The view is widespread that Nomura Securities is strong in 
underwriting services because it has a "strong sales force." For 
city bank securities subsidiaries without a network of branches, 
the key to enhancing profits from bond trading and effective 
performance of underwriting services will depend on how well 
they can attract and process buy and sell orders from clients. 
  That being the case, city banks which had previously 
emphasized government bonds and large investor accounts are now 
emphasizing expansion of their sales forces to handle 
government-guaranteed bonds and local government bonds. 
  At the end of November 1993, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank led other 
banks in using computer terminals to provide the bid and ask 
price on government-guaranteed bonds and local government bonds. 
Such information is now being made available on 11 issues for 
both central government agency and local government bonds. The 
bank intends to expand its client base by trading in government 
agency and local government bonds and to accumulate knowledge on 
how to serve as market maker for future corporate bond issues 
and manage bond inventories on ordinary bonds that are thinly 
traded. The actions being taken by the bank, according to 
trading sources, are motivated by "opportunities for larger 
profits" with government agency and local government bonds where 
the spread between bid and ask prices is wider, in comparison 
with government bonds where spreads are limited. 
  Sources at Mitsubishi Bank comment, "Trading in government 
agency and local government bonds is visibly increasing as 
transactions in the over-the-counter market are taking place in 
blocks of tens of billions of yen." Sales of 
government-guaranteed bonds and local government bonds which 
were underwritten in the past year by the investment accounts 
department are being sold aggressively, while privately placed 
local government bonds which cannot be handled by banks' product 
accounts departments are being purchased from investment 
accounts departments of regional banks and resold to life 
insurance and trusts. It is a case where increased use of such 
transaction conduits are proving to be effective. 
  Noticeable is the success being registered in acquiring new 
clients in regional areas by building a sales force and 
providing carefully tailored services. In April 1993, Sakura 
Bank launched "Operation Roller" staffed by three specialists 
who approached local banks, second local banks, trust banks, 
credit associations, and agricultural cooperatives on a 
concentrated basis to sell long-term government bonds, 
government agency and local government bonds, and privately 
placed local government bonds. Bond operations were expanded by 
the team to all parts of Japan from Hokkaido to Okinawa into 
areas other than prefectural government seats where bond sales 
had previously never been made. 
  Sources in the securities sales department of Sakura Bank, 
conceptualizing the establishment of securities subsidiaries, 
express hope in "making even modest inroads relative to 
potential corporate bond clients to whom it can sell via the 
telephone." 
  If sole dependence is focused on public bonds, there will be 
a limit to acquisition of new clients. In the competitive 
bidding for 10-year long-term government bonds, Fuji Bank won 
bids in fiscal year 1993 for 380 billion yen, three times that 
of the previous year, with the objective of increasing clients 
through the sale of government bonds. However, the bank decided 
that more measures had to be taken and for two years has been 
dispatching personnel to Daito Securities, an affiliate. 
Currently, over 10 personnel are engaged in sales of corporate 
and foreign bonds and are fully dedicated to making preparations 
for future growth. 
  It appears that derivatives such as options and swaps which 
are highly profitable will become one link in building up the 
sales force. The investment accounts department of Sanwa Bank 
began research in arbitrage trading involving derivatives 
composed of an assortment of underlying products such as bonds 
and stocks and in April formed a team that specializes in such 
trading. In the case of Sanwa Bank, according to sources in its 
trading department, it has the objective of "using the current 
period to accumulate knowledge on how to respond to the 
diversification and sophistication needs of clients with a view 
toward expanding future operations." 
  However, sources at major securities firms which must deal 
with the new competition state, "At present, the sales 
capabilities of city banks pose no threat." Banks' securities 
subsidiaries face major restrictions in terms of personnel, 
branch networks, and securities that they can handle, such as 
with stocks, thus placing them at a definite disadvantage to 
major securities firms. A leading city bank official states that 
steady efforts being made by city banks to launch city banks' 
securities subsidiaries are a "necessary step toward ensuring 
the profitability of the subsidiaries," and it appears that they 
have not been afforded the best of operating conditions.

  [Text] According to the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN-sponsored 
survey of syndicated loans issued by 21 major banks, including 
city banks, long-term credit banks, and trust banks, Sanwa Bank 
ranked first in the value of loans arranged in the second half 
of fiscal year 1993 (September 1993 to March 1994). Fuji Bank 
ranked second and The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan ranked 
third. Loans arranged in other than "securitized formats," such 
as floating-rate notes (FRN), reached $5.9 billion, increasing 
sharply by a multiple of 2.5 over the first half of fiscal year 
1993. These figures clearly reflect the aggressive lending 
posture of Japanese banks, which expanded transactions in Hong 
Kong and Thailand. 
  Sanwa Bank, which ranked first overall, arranged loans 
totaling $1.2 billion, a figure far above those for the second 
and lower ranking banks. Sanwa Bank also ranked first in the 
loan department, exclusive of "securitized format" instruments 
such as floating-rate certificates of deposit (FRCD). Sanwa Bank 
utilized its operating base in Hong Kong, which is the largest 
of Japanese city banks, in aggressively arranging syndicated 
loans over a wide region including Thailand, major businessmen 
of Hong Kong, Indonesian petrochemical projects and the 
Malaysian Air Lines. 
  Fuji Bank, which ranked second overall, arranged 29 loans, 
primarily in Indonesia, South Korea, and Singapore. The 
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, which ranked third overall, 
arranged 31 loans, the most for all banks. 
  Aside from the leading city and long-term banks, the 
Hokkaido 
Takushoku Bank ranked fourth on an integrated basis and second 
for pure loan packages. The bank expanded its relations with the 
Taiwanese Evergreen Group whose core operation includes the 
world's largest container shipping company, and arranged a 
series of high-value marine vessel purchasing loans which served 
as the main reason for its ranking in the top group. 
  In the securitized loan department, The Industrial Bank of 
Japan ranked first by arranging a sizable $200 million loan to 
the South Korean Development Bank, while The Long-Term Credit 
Bank of Japan arranged eight loans and ranked second in this 
class, demonstrating the strength of its securities department. 
  Japanese banks were able to record a high rate of growth in 
arranging loans because China, South Korea, and the Southeast 
Asian region are involved in an increasing number of projects 
requiring huge sums of capital, including social infrastructure 
projects such as electric power plants and road construction and 
energy investment projects such as petroleum development. There 
is also the fact that a suspension in growth of loans in Japan 
and Europe and the United States due to recessionary conditions 
is being offset by increased loans in Asia. 
  City banks and long-term credit banks are increasing staff 
in 
Asian areas such as Hong Kong and Singapore in order to beef up 
their international syndicated lending operations. The future 
will see increasing competition as European, U.S., and Asian 
local banks also step up their banking activities in a similar 
manner.

  [Text] Effective 1 July, the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications [MOPT] will increase to 300 the number of 
post offices handling foreign exchange conversions, an increase 
of 40. The change represents one phase of the MOPT's 
globalization strategy and its aim is to boost customer services 
in competition with privately operated banks. The post offices 
providing the new services will convert currencies between the 
Japanese yen and seven other currencies, including U.S. dollar, 
French franc, and British pound; they are also scheduled to sell 
and cash travelers' checks in eight currencies, including the 
yen. 
  Based on a 12-region breakdown of the country, post offices 
newly designated to provide the money-conversion services 
include 10 each for Kanto and Tokyo, seven for Kinki, and six 
for Tokai, mostly in urban areas. Others included one each for 
Hokkaido, Tohoku, Shinetsu, Hokuriku, Chugoku, Shikoku, and 
Kyushu, and none for Okinawa. Sources at the International 
Operations Section of the Postal Savings Bureau explain, "These 
figures reflect the selection of post offices on the basis of 
the number of people who travel overseas, demand for currency 
conversion, and regional balance." 
  According to the MOPT, the majority of individuals who need 
to convert foreign currencies or to buy or cash travelers' 
checks are about 20 years old, but few of them have an occasion 
to use a post office. The goal for the increase in the number of 
post offices handling foreign exchange services is to boost the 
patronage of post offices by individuals in that age category. 
Privately operated banks doubled the number of bank branches 
offering such services on a nationwide basis to about 8,500 in 
the four-year period ending in 1992 and the MOPT decided to 
increase the number of post offices handling the services from a 
total of 100 three years ago. 
  The MOPT not only plans to increase the number of post 
offices offering foreign exchange conversion services, but to 
expand its international remittance services.

<F P=106> [Article by Toru Nagai, Daiwa Research Institute: "Blast </F>
Furnace Industry To Have Hard Time Extricating Itself From 
Iron-Steel Recession: Will Be Pressed To Specialize in 
Profitable Varieties"] 
  [Text] The desperate struggle of the blast furnace 
industry, which had held the position of Japan's key industry, 
continues. It is certain that the five major companies will 
have their first ordinary loss in seven years. The situation is 
serious because of such things as a decline in demand for iron 
and steel and an offensive by electric furnaces. It is even 
possible that it will trod the same path as the U.S. blast 
furnace industry. 
<H5>  More Serious Than During the Strong Yen Recession </H5>
  It is estimated that Japan's total production of crude steel 
in FY93 will be about 96.6 million tons, 2.5 percent less than 
the previous year, falling below 100 million tons for two years 
in a row for the first time since since the oil shock. It is 
expected that a further decline in production volume will be 
unavoidable in FY94 as well, and the outlook is for it to fall 
to the 1970 level of 91 million tons, a decline of about 20 
percent from FY90, the most recent peak. 
  Under these circumstances, the slump in business results of 
the major blast furnace companies, which have led Japan's iron 
and steel industry, is striking. It is certain that the profit 
and loss of major blast furnace companies for the March 1994 
period will decline to the first real loss in seven years. 
Moreover, ordinary loss on a real base, not counting profits on 
securities sold, is expected to total 280 billion yen [Y] for 
the five major companies. Furthermore, because of a decline in 
sales volume and so on, it is very possible that the margin of 
loss will widen to top Y360 billion in the next period. 
  This is a level which rivals the period of the strong yen 
recession, which was called an "iron chill." One can say that 
we are encountering what is truly a second "iron chill." 
  By simple calculation, if this loss were to continue for the 
next five years, some of the major blast furnace companies would 
certainly fall into excessive debt. If it erred in its response, 
its management base would probably be lost, even if it were 
iron and steel companies which have long reigned as the essence 
of Japan's manufacturing industries. Practically speaking, the 
possibility that this scenario will become a reality is by no 
means slight. 
  This is because the conditions surrounding the present iron 
and steel industry are more serious than those during the 
strong yen recession. First of all, there can be cited the fact 
that there is already little room for rationalization at 
production sites. Much was adjusted considerably during the 
strong yen recession, so things have progressed to a stage where 
it will be impossible to make production more efficient unless 
there is some technological innovation. Furthermore, there is 
also the fact that such diversification sectors as 
semiconductors and leisure industries, in which a great deal of 
capital has been invested by the steel companies during the 
period of prosperity after 1987, have not yet produced 
conspicuous positive results, but, conversely, are weighing on 
them as burdens of large fixed expenses. And one can probably 
say that another reason is that, in both domestic and foreign 
demand, it is difficult to find a scenario for recovery of 
demand for steel products, because at a time when adjustment of 
stock is continuing under asset deflation, employment 
uncertainty has also become serious; so, for the time being, it 
is difficult to anticipate expansion of consumption or of plant 
and equipment investment. 
  In addition, difficult-to-handle structural problems have 
arisen which are more important than this kind of problem; they 
are the following three points: first, that a difference between 
foreign and domestic prices has become constant; second, a large 
gap exists between supply and demand; and third, the rise of 
electric furnaces. 
  These problems, which began to surface in the "iron chill," 
are becoming a new weight on major blast furnace companies. 
  In addition to having negated the benefit of cheap raw 
materials through its indirect effect--a decline in proceeds 
from export sales and a reduction in domestic production of cars 
and electrical machinery, which are major users of steel 
products--it is natural that the strong yen would put pressure 
on iron and steel industry earnings. 
  However, it is more important that the unjustified strength 
of the yen since the Plaza Accord is producing a long-term 
difference between foreign and domestic prices of steel 
materials. If one looks at Japanese and U.S. prices for steel 
materials converted at the market exchange rate, the average 
market for hot coil steel over the last five years has been 
about $560 per ton in Japan in contrast to $350 per ton in the 
United States, so Japan has constantly been about $220 higher 
per ton. 
  Because of such non-price competitiveness as delivery and 
stability and reliability of quality, which the blast furnace 
companies possess, users have continued to use domestic 
products up till now. But it is to be expected that this 
long-term difference between foreign and domestic prices is 
having a strong impact on the cost-competitiveness of the final 
product. 
  In fact, users, who are being forced to further reduce 
costs, 
have begun to study full-scale use of low-priced imported steel 
products. Already, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., Japan's 
largest shipbuilder, has decided that in FY94 it will double its 
previous rate of overseas procurement of materials. 
  It is becoming a situation where, despite being under the 
conditions of an "iron chill," no blast furnace company will be 
able to avoid price reductions to match overseas products, in 
order to go on securing their market share. 
  The second point, realization of a gap between supply and 
demand, is not only a problem of the blast furnace industry 
having a quantitative excess-supply capacity; it is probably 
also important that it is being forced to take another look at 
the strategy of improving the grade of steel products, which 
every company has pursued until now. 
  Production of products with high added value, particularly 
surface-treated steel plate, which are typical product types of 
major blast furnace companies, has continued to grow steadily 
since the oil shock, at the rate of seven percent a year. This 
is because development of the strategy to "shift from pursuing 
volume to enhancing quality," which all blast furnace companies 
adopted when, after 1975, national crude steel production 
clearly leveled off, suited the needs of users with a greater 
inclination toward higher grade. The companies all anticipated a 
further expansion of demand and advancement of the shift from 
products with low added value, so they have greatly increased 
and strengthened industrial facilities. 
  But now a movement has appeared in users and final consumers 
to review a change toward higher grade and higher quality that 
has gone too far. Practically speaking, it is difficult to 
discover a need to equip passenger cars, which in Japan are used 
an average of only nine years, with rustproof steel plate that 
can last as long as 30 years, so it can probably be said that 
the real situation is that companies are becoming oriented 
toward raising the grade within a range suited to needs. 
  The result is that, along with a decline in auto production, 
demand for surface-treated steel plate has declined by 13 
percent from its peak. On the other hand, many new facilities 
have been completed, so there are indications that current 
average operation capacity has fallen to about 60 percent. 
  This means that correction of earning power by enhancing 
quality, which has functioned effectively in past recessions, 
has run into a big barrier from both the user side and the 
supplier side. 
<H5>  "Attacking Electric Furnaces, Defending Blast Furnaces" </H5>
  The third item I pointed out, the problem of the rise of 
electric furnaces, is, to put it bluntly, that Tokyo Steel Mfg. 
Co., Ltd., the largest electric furnace company, began to 
produce hot coil steel plate, which was the stronghold of blast 
furnaces, for the first time in Japan. Beginning in 1992, Tokyo 
Steel sold hot coil steel plate at about Y45,000, more than 
Y10,000 per ton below the existing market price, and within 
about a year ended up winning approximately 30 percent of the 
3.5 million ton import market, which it had made its target. 
  As for quality, at present there remain areas where it is 
not 
up to that of blast furnace products. But one has to think 
that, sooner or later, blast furnace manufacturers will feel the 
spread of its influence. 
  Even before this, the proportion of national crude steel 
accounted for by electric steel was on an upward trend. But that 
was done in steel bars and H beams which, from the standpoint of 
blast furnaces, are low-value-added construction materials. For 
thin-plate varieties, a state of monopoly has continued as a 
revenue source for blast furnaces companies. 
  In other words, because it entered a product where it is 
possible to shake the foundations of blast furnaces in the 
future, Tokyo Steel can become an entity which also threatens 
the lifeline of blast furnaces. Here we can probably see a 
design for "attacking electric furnaces and defending blast 
furnaces." 
  But as long as we look at the most recent situation, the 
rollback by blast furnaces is striking. The situation is such 
that in production of H beams for the first half of FY93 the 
market share for blast furnace products rose for the first time 
in three years, recovering to 41 percent from 33 percent in 
FY87,. Furthermore, moves have been realized to check the 
remarkably fast-growing independent Tokyo Steel by attempting 
cooperation and expansion of business content of companies which 
are in their keiretsu: for example, Topi Industries, which is 
affiliated with Nippon Steel Corporation, is considering new 
entrance into steel bars; and Kawasaki Steel Corporation has 
decided to produce steel plate using electric steel manufactured 
by its keiretsu affiliate, Daiwa Steel. 
  As a major trend, there will probably be no change in the 
superiority of the electric furnace, which is gradually 
expanding the types of products that it can produce, and there 
is no doubt that in the future the segregation of niches for 
products on the basis of blast furnaces and electric furnaces 
will become more and more vague. 
  It can be said that each blast furnace company will have to 
change from a strategy of putting effort into high-value-added 
products to the direction of actively securing market share in 
all products, even at the sacrifice of immediate earnings. 
Consequently, it can probably be said that it will be impossible 
in the future for them to avoid a desperate war of strength or 
war of attrition, even as blast furnace companies. 
<H5>  The Downfall of U.S. Blast Furnaces </H5>
  Although there is a difference in degree, in the following 
points this situation closely resembles that of the U.S. iron 
and steel industry in the first half of the 1980's. 
  First, besides domestic demand for steel having declined 
because such manufacturing industries as autos were losing 
competitiveness as a result of a strong dollar and a change in 
user tastes, there was also an influx of relatively inexpensive 
imports, so a large drop in prices could not be avoided. 
  Because of that, in 1982 the amount of crude steel produced 
declined by 38 percent from the previous year, retreating to the 
level of 36 years before. With the rate of operation falling to 
the 40 percent level, and so on, every blast furnace company 
ended up having a big gap between supply and demand. 
  And U.S. electric furnace manufacturers, represented by 
Nucor, advanced rapidly, with overwhelming cost competitiveness 
as their weapon. They expanded their share from 28 percent in 
1981 to 40 percent in 1990, and so on. 
  The result was that U.S. blast furnace companies registered 
losses beginning in 1982, and really were unable to restore 
profits until 1987. Moreover, even with that, they did not 
firmly establish a profitable setup, but were forced to record 
losses again accompanying the fall in market conditions after 
1990. 
  This was in spite of the fact that during this time they 
strongly promoted the restructuring of business by abandoning 
production facilities totaling more than 40 million tons for the 
industry, and reducing employees by 250,000 (about 64 percent). 
  But now, against a background of enforcement of antidumping 
laws and a steady recovery of their own country's economy, in 
addition to these efforts at rationalization, U.S. steelmakers 
are steadily securing profits. There is also a strong 
possiblity that they will overtake Japan for the first time in 
15 years in the volume of crude steel produced in 1994. 
  It is probably natural that there are also areas that differ 
between the United States, where a decline in international 
competitiveness in the areas of quality and cost was becoming 
noticeable from the latter half of the 1970's, and that of 
present-day Japan. But it is probably worth pointing out that 
even in the United States, which has resolutely carried out a 
bold restructuring in this way, recovery really required 10 
years. 
  The biggest cause for recovery of the U.S. steel industry 
being delayed was that it was impossible to drastically 
increase international competitiveness by such things as plant 
and equipment investment. At a time of successive losses 
because of a decline in volume and in the market against the 
background of an influx of imports, the industry had to curtail 
investment in plant and equipment. 
  Moreover, with plant and equipment that has become obsolete, 
one naturally cannot attempt to enhance quality or improve 
production efficiency, and costs also become relatively higher. 
The result was that it had fallen into a vicious cycle of the 
market being conquered still further by imports, and business 
results becoming still more sluggish. Today stagnation of 
business results is becoming long-term this way even for Japan's 
steel industry, which has the world's top level of quality and 
equipment, so if constriction of plant and equipment investment 
continues, it could very well become a situation similar to that 
of the U.S. steel industry. 
  Therefore, the foundation of the structural reform which is 
being forced upon the blast furnace companies probably comes 
down to hastening reduction of costs by countermeasures which 
are drastic and not shackled by preconceived ideas, so as to 
restore price competitiveness soon. The stopgaps of 
diversification and change to high added value which have been 
carried out up to now and the strategies of each company to keep 
abreast of the industry cannot be drastic measures. 
<H5>  The Strategy That Remains </H5>
  In that case, where is the concrete strategy that major 
blast 
furnace companies should choose? In order to consider that, I 
first analyzed the cost structure of the major blast furnace 
companies, and tried a comparison with South Korea and Taiwan. I 
used South Korea and Taiwan in the comparison because, whether 
viewed geographically, qualitatively, or from import business 
results, they have begun to be the greatest competitors against 
Japanese products. 
  Please look at Table 1. It is a breakdown of costs viewed by 
total cost without taking into consideration differences in 
product composition. In the table, with FY92 real results as the 
base, for the sake of convenience I calculated $1 as 100 yen, 
750 won and NT$25 [new Taiwan dollars].

|Note: Actual results for FY92 were converted at the rate of $1 equals 100  |

|pon Steel Corporation, Kawasaki Steel Corporation, and Sumitomo Metal Indu-| 
|stries, Ltd., whose nonferrous metal departments are of relatively little  | 
|weight. For South Korea it was Pohang Steel, and for Taiwan it was China S-|

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The production cost per ton of steel material in Japan is 
$718, 1.9 times as high as South Korea's $388 and Taiwan's $374. 
  When we divide this into fixed costs and variable costs, the 
main variable costs being the major raw materials of iron ore 
and coking coal, which are procured on the international market, 
and the the basic units used being about the same, a large 
difference has not arisen among Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. 
In contrast to this, in the fixed costs per ton, compared with 
South Korea's $166 and Taiwan's $150, Japan is $435, so it works 
out to be a gap of from 2.6 to 2.9 times. One can say that the 
cost differential among Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan springs 
from fixed costs. 
  Personnel costs can probably be listed first as a reason why 
Japan's fixed costs are high in comparison with South Korea and 
Taiwan. In addition to South Korea's annual unit cost for 
personnel being about $30,000, a level one-third that of Japan, 
South Korea is also superior in productivity judged by per 
capita production volume, with 854 tons to Japan's 730 tons. 
  Therefore the personnel cost per ton is $35 for South Korea 
and $133 for Japan, a multiple of 3.8. On the other hand, in 
Taiwan, although per capita productivity is 633 tons, below that 
of Japan, unit personnel cost is about $45,000, just half that 
of Japan, so personnel cost per ton comes out to be less than 
Japan after all. 
  In per ton cost of maintenance and repair also, it is 
estimated that Japan's burden (about $90) is greater than South 
Korea's $15 and Taiwan's $1. This is partly because the 
equipment in the iron and steel mills that South Korea and 
Taiwan possess is newer, so maintenance and repair are not too 
necessary, but I think what is behind it is, rather, that when 
Japan was promoting a change to high-value-added products, it 
thoroughly pursued greater efficiency in producing many 
varieties in small volume to respond to customer needs. 
  Furthermore, in the case of Japan, the burden of other fixed 
costs, product development and improvement costs, which are 
required for providing high value-added products, is also heavy. 
Therefore, in order to grasp international competitiveness in a 
more realistic manner by taking into consideration differences 
in product composition, we will make a comparison with hot coil 
plate as the benchmark. 
  The important thing for Japanese steelmakers is probably 
whether or not the production cost for hot coil plate, which 
holds the most central position among steel products, is low in 
comparison with the import price of products from South Korea 
and Taiwan. If Japanese products were to become high in 
comparison, the rationality of producing everything from 
pig-iron to rolling as an integrated company would end up being 
considerably diminished. 
  The production cost for hot coil plate estimated by the 
Daiwa 
Research Institute, taking a typical Japanese steel mill as the 
model, was a little over 51,000 yen per ton in FY92. It breaks 
down to 39,600 yen for costs at the factory stage and 11,400 yen 
for headquarters costs. On the other hand, the unit cost (on a 
domestic market base) for imported hot coil plate in the same 
period was 55,500 yen for South Korean products, so at that 
stage the cost for Japanese companies was less than the market. 
But the market has now fallen to the level of 50,000 yen to 
51,000 yen, so if blast furnace companies' production cost is 
also the same now, I think their international competitiveness 
is already in a fairly severe state. Therefore, what is probably 
demanded first of all in order to recover competitiveness is 
reducing the cost for hot coil plate. 
  However, in the next several years, of the employees who 
joined the companies in great numbers during the time of high 
growth, a combined total for the five companies of over 10,000 
will reach the mandatory retirement age. Because of that, there 
is a view that the cost for major blast furnace companies will 
be reduced naturally. And, even if losses were to also continue 
during that time, if they covered it by realizing the latent 
profit from land and securities, which is as much as 5.5 
trillion yen for the five companies, it would probably also be 
possible to again secure a certain amount of profit after that. 
It is the view that there is no need to stir up feelings of 
uneasiness uselessly. 
  But this does not go beyond the realm of temporary 
improvement of profits. Even if estimated on the high side, the 
cost-reduction effect anticipated from staff reduction would be 
about 3,000 yen per ton. If the structural problems cited 
previously grow more serious, I think it will no longer be 
possible to absorb them by that level of cost reduction. 
<H5>  White-Collar Staff Are the Target </H5>
  The first thing to be considered as an object for cutting 
the 
cost of hot coil plate is probably management-sector costs, 
which grew conspicuously after the strong yen recession. 
  It is estimated that the cost per ton for the indirect 
management sector, which is made up of headquarters costs and 
the portion of plant fixed costs that corresponds to management 
processes, rose 7,900 yen from FY85 to FY92. Because of that, 
the benefit of cheap raw materials was diminished greatly by the 
rise in the cost of the management sector, so total cost 
declined only a mere 1,300 yen. Compared with the 
direct-production sector, where the effect of rationalization 
has begun to appear, indirect management sector costs are rising 
rapidly, and are thought to be a great weight on earnings. 
  For cutting cost in the indirect-management sector, one can 
probably cite raising the productivity of so-called white-collar 
staff. All the blast furnace companies have already made clear 
in medium-range plans that they expect to reduce indirect-sector 
personnel by 15 to 20 percent by transfers and the like. 
  But in a situation in which excess staff has become a 
problem 
for the entire industry, it is difficult to imagine that many 
companies will be able to accept staff on temporary transfer. 
Furthermore, even if all the places to receive them were ready, 
in order to preserve the salary level of the staff on transfer, 
companies would have to carry the burden of paying the 
difference between the salary at the home company and at the 
company to which they transferred, so the reality is that one 
cannot hope for the rationalization effect that would appear to 
exist on the face of things. Herein lies the problem with 
putting staff reduction into effect through transfers. According 
to Daiwa Research Institute estimates, with no increase in the 
salary base as a premise, even by reducing indirect staff 20 
percent through transfers, it comes out that one could expect a 
cost-reduction effect of only a little under 500 yen per ton. 
  The effect of speeding reduction of the costs of product 
development and improvement would be greater. I think there is 
room for restudying whether excessive enhancement of quality and 
pursuit of scrupulous delivery have not developed into excess 
quality and high costs. It is probably fully possible to reduce 
various costs by reconsidering proper quality and production 
processes within limits not prejudicial to user needs. 
  In addition, reducing costs by reforming business practices 
is also conceivable as a drastic plan for improvement. The 
commission paid by blast furnace companies to trading companies 
for procuring raw materials and selling their products is 
estimated, in the case of Japan Steel Corporation, for example, 
to be at least 50 billion yen per year (a little over 2,000 yen 
per ton). Although difficult problems do exist because of 
historical circumstances, reducing costs by switching from this 
system of commissioning trading companies to one of managing 
things in-house is probably also worth studying. 
<H5>  There Will Also Be Industry Reorganization </H5>
  But, even if blast furnace companies recover price 
competitiveness soon, the environment will become still harsher 
over the medium term. The development of national production of 
crude steel has moved from a period of expansion (1954-1970) 
which coincided with a period of high growth, to a period of 
cycles (1971 to the present), in which production varies upward 
and downward from a core of 103-104 million tons, depending on 
the business cycle. In the future, the core level of the cycle 
is expected to drop to 90-95 million tons if the decline of 
domestic demand because of deindustrialization and enhanced 
quality continues. 
  If, in addition to domestic demand for iron and steel 
decreasing by 10 percent, the ratio of imports to apparent 
demand were to become 20 percent, as in the United States (FY92 
results were 8 percent), and the ratio for electric steel were, 
similarly, to exceed 40 percent (FY92 results were 32 percent), 
it would be a market reduction of a little less than 23 million 
tons for blast furnace manufacturers. 
  This corresponds approximately to the production scale of 
Japan Steel Corporation, the world's largest manufacturer of 
iron and steel, and means that three of Japan's typical 
large-scale iron and steel mills would become surplus. 
  At this point I will present, as a new management strategy, 
a 
tentative plan for industry reeingineering: the narrowing of 
product types through priority investment. At present, blast 
furnace companies are producing virtually every variety of steel 
product, and the problem of the large variety of goods produced 
is quite important as a factor in high costs. 
  The product lineup of every company closely resembles that 
of 
the others, so there are also many cases in which it invites 
excessive competition. Furthermore, in portfolio management, in 
which profitable products compensate for unprofitable sectors, 
one delays disposal of unprofitable products as a result, so it 
becomes impossible to make use of assets effectively. 
  Big cost reductions will probably be possible if companies 
narrow the types of items they produce, and specialize in 
products at which they are stronger. This rationalization 
effect will be accompanied by a reduction in the burden of plant 
and equipment investment and simplification of the management 
sector and also by effective asset utilization and an escape 
from excess competition, so I think it will surpass a simple 
increase in staff efficiency. 
  Sumitomo Metal Industries' plan for a buildup in seamless 
pipe, which was announced at the beginning of 1993, will 
probably be given great attention as pioneer in this line. At 
present, because of such things as the strong yen and a retreat 
in demand, seamless pipe has become typical of unprofitable 
products, which are recording an estimated yearly loss of 80-90 
billion yen for the industry as a whole. I think that this kind 
of buildup plan, in a situation in which earnings are sluggish, 
is clearly a strategy to shake off pursuit by competing 
companies. 
  Furthermore, the appearance of restructuring that transcends 
the framework of individual companies is also conceivable. To be 
precise, by extending the narrowing down of product types by 
each company, one can imagine, such things as swapping of 
product types between companies, a change to joint ownership of 
equipment and management sectors, and disposal of surplus plant 
and equipment which are generated at that time and, ultimately, 
mergers. 
  Particularly in regard to disposal of plant and equipment, 
there is a good possibility of early realization. At present 
each company's production setup is built on the assumption that 
national crude steel production estimated at 104-106 million 
tons is the optimum rate of operation. It is thought that they 
will be reviewed at a time when the production level is expected 
to decline over the medium term. That will probably also be 
similar for plant and equipment for surface treating. 
  On the other hand, so far as can be considered at present, 
there is little likelihood of mergers becoming a reality. Even 
if there were a merger, rationalization of the indirect sector 
would require considerable time, so it would probably be 
difficult for the benefit to appear soon. But there is a strong 
probability of business links being formed because of plant 
sites and product types. It has also been predicted that the 
industry will be concentrated into about three groups in the 
future. 
  In any case, we are in a situation in which, if the exchange 
level is not corrected in the direction of a weaker yen, no 
blast furnace company will be able to avoid a long-term slump 
and a drop in competitiveness unless there are a rapid rise in 
production efficiency and a great reduction in management costs. 
It can probably be said that Japan's blast furnace industry has 
an urgent need for the entire industry to adopt drastic measures 
which transcend preconceived ideas, beginning with major 
reductions in staff and curtailment of the management sector.

Hiroyuki Kubo: "The Heisei Era's Big Derangement"] 
<H5>  [28 Apr 94 Evening Edition p 1] </H5>
  [Excerpts] "Now we have had more than enough of this." 
Since Prime Minister Hosokawa resigned a half month ago, there 
have been a series of events such as the nomination of new Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata to succeed him, the secession of the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] from the coalition 
regime, and then the formation of a minority ruling coalition 
cabinet. Gradually, the people in the spectators' seats are 
beginning to raise boos at this slapstick play. Yet I would like 
to advise the spectators not to take their eyes off the 
"reality" now unfolding under their noses. This is because the 
slapstick play, when viewed from a different angle, may 
unexpectedly remind them of Wagner's opera The Ring of 
the Nibelung whose performance takes as long as four days. 
  For example, in this drama Ichiro Ozawa, the strongman and 
secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], was made 
an out-and-out villain, and when the SDPJ at last "exhausted its 
stock of patience" (SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama) and seceded 
from the government, the party headquarters reportedly received 
a flood of encouraging calls saying that "I feel refreshed for 
the first time in a long while." However, with the secession as 
an impetus, there has burst forth all at once the "political 
change in June theory"--a view that a no-confidence motion 
against the cabinet will be presented by the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP] and the SDPJ and that through its passage, the Lower 
House will be dissolved. What on earth does this theory mean? 
  First, it is clear among others that the "parallel 
combination formula coupling the small electoral district system 
with proportional representation," which was approved in the 
former Hosokawa cabinet, will not be ready for use in June 
because rezoning is not to be finalized by then, thereby leaving 
no option but to carry out the general election under the 
present midsize constituency system. However, what matters here 
is not simply the use of such a temporary expedient. Let us 
suppose that lawmakers are elected by winning the people's trust 
anew under the present medium-size constituency system. Will 
they ever try to complete the "parallel combination formula" 
which has been neglected and left unfinished since before the 
house dissolution? 
  In Nagata-cho people are now openly expressing "the view 
that 
the parallel combination formula will have the same fate as the 
green card [tax identification card]." That is, in the Yasuhiro 
Nakasone cabinet era, a green card system bill was enacted into 
law, but it was never enforced and repealed in the face of 
strong opposition within the LDP. Those people are saying that 
the "parallel combination formula" will have the same fate. 
"Political reform" has reached the present stage at length 
through five years of effort under three regimes--if we begin 
counting from the Toshiki Kaifu cabinet. It is clear that a 
heinous scenario designed to bring this achievement to nothing 
at a stroke has been drawn up by a group aspiring for the return 
of the "1955 order" [the party system realized in 1955] on the 
initiative of the LDP and the SDPJ. [passage omitted on Wagner's 
aforementioned opera and the dramatic end of the Weimar 
Constitution through Hitler's emergence] 
  What will come next if we leave this "slapstick 
drama"--filled with insincerity and betrayal and being performed 
recklessly in total disregard of the people--to take its own 
course? It is feared that someday these three dramas [the 
current Japanese political situation, Wagner's opera, and the 
end of the Weimar Constitution], transcending their different 
time and space frames, might overlap one another, proving that 
they have the same catastrophe. Who can guarantee that such a 
day will never come? 
  The possibility of a joint struggle by the LDP and the SDPJ 
under a "strategy seeking parliamentary dissolution [and the 
general election] on the basis of the medium-size constituency" 
is getting stronger as days go by, although SDPJ Chairman 
Murayama is hotly denying it. Apart from what he has in mind 
politically, Rengo [National Confederation of Trade Unions] 
Chairman Akira Yamagishi, who has actively wrestled with 
political reform, makes the following remarks: "The SDPJ is 
saying that it is not bound to items agreed on regarding the 
coalition government. When occasion demands, it might put 
forward a no-confidence motion against the cabinet." He has 
thus begun expressing eagerly the view that it is possible to 
hold a general election under the medium-size constituency 
system. 
  Some in the LDP are already predicting the results of the 
election to be held under the current medium-size constituency. 
It is said that, according to the predicted election returns, 
the LDP is certain to secure the current 220 seats and the SDPJ 
and Shinseito will gain 10 to 20 seats, while the Japan New 
Party [JNP] and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] will suffer 
a decrease. 
  To be sure, as LDP President Yohei Kono says, former Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's individual scandal related to the 
Sagawa Kyubin trucking firm poses a problem. As SDPJ Chairman 
Murayama says, the position of "monopolizing politics by the 
force of numbers" should not be taken lightly. Such a position 
was symbolized in the formation of "Kaishin" [Innovation], a new 
parliamentary group, which was forcibly carried out by Shinseito 
Secretary General Ozawa and others in the current "slapstick 
drama." However, a far more serious concern is the actual 
situation marked by "political retrogression" in which the 
sloppy old structural attributes--which may be linked to the 
revival of the "1955 order" through the LDP-SDPJ tie-up--have 
burst forth at a stroke. 
  The Weimar system's collapse was not caused only by the 
appearance of Hitler. It is pointed out that the largest problem 
was the posture of intellectuals and others belonging to the 
political elite who evaded assuming the governing responsibility 
by solely avoiding "power" or by trying to stand "against power." 
  The SDPJ Diet members are even showing a look of relief 
because they have returned to their original position as a 
perpetual opposition where it only has to raise a voice of 
opposition. 
  When the Hata minority coalition government was inaugurated, 
LDP President Yohei Kono said: "The coalition government 
virtually collapsed. It failed in the game of power, and we will 
not extend a helping hand. A failure is a failure, and we will 
make a strong protest against the failure." Is there really no 
problem in such a clumsy manner? 
<H5>  [1 May 94 Evening Edition p 1] </H5>
  [Text] Commenting on Jiyuto [Liberal Party] Chairman Koji 
Kakizawa, who got the post of foreign minister only 10 days 
after he bolted from the LDP, LDP President Yohei Kono spoke 
viciously as follows: "He is a man who criticized the coalition 
government just one month ago at a plenary session of the Diet 
as an LDP delegate. What is he thinking of the criticism he 
leveled thus far? I would like to hear his answer to this 
question." He said this because it was only 7 March that Mr. 
Kakizawa, in his lower house interpellation, denounced the 
coalition severely, asking, "How about dissolving the coalition 
and turning over power to the LDP?" 
  On the same issue, former LDP Secretary General Keizo Obuchi 
(chairman of the Obuchi faction) made the following cynical 
remarks: "I will not criticize. It is because they are the kind 
of people who will return again when the LDP captures power." 
There is a "difference of temperature in the languages" used by 
the two. This difference cannot be brushed off as simply the 
outcome of two different positions--the position of a party 
president who has to tie up the party in a bundle and the post 
of a faction chief who is rather carefree. It would have been 
better if Mr. Kono had not responded and passed the matter with 
silence. 
  It appears that Mr. Kono does not have a favorable 
impression 
of Prime Minister Hata either. Regarding Mr. Hata, who supported 
the no-confidence motion against the Miyazawa cabinet when a 
political change took place in the summer of last year, Mr. Kono 
reportedly says repeatedly that "the person who had served even 
as finance minister in the Miyazawa cabinet betrayed Prime 
Minister Miyazawa before his eyes." Mr. Kono stressed a position 
of confrontation with the new government, saying: "We will not 
extend a helping hand. A failure is a failure, and we will make 
a strong protest against the failure." When he said this, I 
think that his mind was overshadowed by his personal feelings, 
was it not? 
  Commenting on Mr. Kono's capacity as a leader, former LDP 
Executive Council Chairman Raizo Matsuno once said: "In hunting 
wild boars, we need a beater; however, if a man who is supposed 
to draw a bow plays the role of the beater, we will never get 
any game." Mr. Kono's seriousness is valuable, but he is hung up 
on minor details and very suspicious and harbors a grudge 
against any act of betrayal in the past. With such a character, 
he would be unable to work as a leader in such turbulent times. 
This is because he cannot compete favorably with Mr. Ichiro 
Ozawa of Shinseito who has the clear view that "the politics of 
the era of coalition and alliance is the work of seizing power 
by obtaining the number of persons required, regardless of their 
being a little strange or betrayers." 
  At a press conference he held after his inauguration, new 
Prime Minister Hata, who was compelled to start a minority 
ruling coalition government due to the SDPJ's secession, 
touching on the LDP, said that "I would like to ask for 
cooperation in the policy field." Mr. Kono probably thought that 
Mr. Hata "sure does take a lot for granted." However, the 
question is not simply how the ordinary people feel; the 
seriousness of the situation has been assuming far greater 
proportions. 
  For example, the new Hata government is now faced with "tax 
system reform" whose centerpiece is a consumption tax hike. As 
for this reform, there is utterly no prospect of its legislation 
even if its bill gets finalized within the ruling camp by June. 
The Hata government aims to reopen the Japan-U.S. new economic 
consultations by the time when the summit meeting of advanced 
countries (the Naples summit) are held in July. However, the 
U.S. side is insisting on the "continuation of a large tax 
reduction" as a prerequisite, and rough sailing is inevitable 
with regard to the talks. In addition, concerning North Korea's 
nuclear development issue to which Prime Minister Hata and his 
followers attach the utmost importance, there is no assurance 
that the Japanese Government can respond swiftly if the 
situation makes a sudden move toward sanctions by the United 
Nations. 
  Tax system reform and the North Korean nuclear development 
issue are questions related exceedingly to the "sovereignty of 
our state." The deadlock into which the new government fell is 
not the kind of problem that we can dispose of by simply 
charging Mr. Ozawa that the deadlock is totally the "natural 
consequence of misdeeds" stemming from his thoughtlessness. We 
see herein the irresponsibility of Mr. Ozawa, who plunged the 
situation straight into confusion without giving deep thought to 
what will happen if the new parliamentary group "Kaishin" is 
formed with the SDPJ excluded. However, to put it the other way 
around, we can note the same irresponsibility by Mr. Kono. What 
we see here is a lack of "ruling ability and ruling 
responsibility." 
  The tragedy of Japan at present is the fact that the two 
major opposition parties called the LDP and the SDPJ, which take 
pride in their influences as the first and second parties by 
comparison, are both fallen into a state devoid of "ruling 
ability and responsibility." 
  Former Chancellor Schmidt who was the leader of the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] once made the following 
remarks to the SDPJ on the basis of his experiences: 1) the SPD 
which shifted to a "realistic policy line" in 1959 "acquired 
compromising techniques" through "coalition" with the then 
ruling party Christian Democratic Union; 2) "a step-by-step 
response for the recognition of the actual status is necessary 
as an immediate measure in carrying out reform"; and 3) "we must 
learn the profound art of the international power game between 
the U.S. and Soviet superpowers." 
  The SDPJ achieved "coalition"; however, without learning 
from 
Mr. Schmidt's advice, it seceded from the coalition government 
after eight months. The inside of the SDPJ is overflowing with 
smiling faces from the refreshing feeling that the party has 
been released from the "eight-month-long hardship" and "has 
returned to the seat of opposition." From what has the party 
escaped? 
  Mr. Masayoshi Takemura (leader of Sakigake [Harbinger]), who 
left the cabinet a little earlier, expressed his desire to unite 
all forces within the LDP which are dovish and opposed to 
constitutional amendments, claiming that he has the "same views" 
with Mr. Kiichi Miyazawa, Mr. Masaharu Gotoda, and Mr. Kono on 
the Constitution and the nation. It is needless to say that he 
gave yells to the SDPJ's secession from the government. 
  The political situation has shifted its axis from the "LDP 
versus non-LDP" to the "Ichiro Ozawa versus non-Ozawa." However, 
what on earth is it that is being concealed under the anti-Ozawa 
banner which asserts that "insincere and high-handed political 
methods" (party president Kono) and "the fascist way of doing 
things" (Chairman Tomiichi Murayama) are intolerable? 
  Following the end of the ideological confrontation, groups 
within the SDPJ such as the citizens' faction and the 
left-leaning group, trendy leftists, and the faction for 
pacifism and constitutional defense are forming a congeries of 
families like a stagnant pool of drifters across the existing 
political parties. Shaping a large "cold water mass" devoid of 
the ruling responsibility, they are now going to strike roots in 
the ground prior to the nation's important decision-making which 
concerns Japan's survival... with their own "lack of ability to 
become responsible authorities" concealed.... 
<H5>  [2 May 94 Evening Edition p 1] </H5>
  [Text] Commenting on former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka 
about the time when he was wielding his power as the kingmaker, 
former Justice Minister Osamu Inaba once told: "Pushkin said 
that the people who are led by an uncultured politician are 
unfortunate." 
  If Mr. Inaba were still alive, he would express the same 
feeling about Shinseito strongman Secretary General Ichiro 
Ozawa, Mr. Tanaka's onetime favorite disciple, who uttered wild 
words that "it makes no matter which woman one goes to bed with" 
when the SDPJ stood against the formation of the new 
parliamentary group "Kaishin." 
  Among ongoing criticisms against Ozawa are "insincere and 
high-handed political methods," "a straightforward way of 
thinking devoid of prudence and consideration for the outcome," 
"the way he does things is bold, but his political technique is 
immature, resulting in a continuation of failures," and "a lack 
of grace due to a contempt for women." Each of them is generally 
right. Yet they are still insufficient to depict the whole image 
(the reason for existence) of the unique personality of "Ichiro 
Ozawa," who has appeared at a huge turning point like our 
present era. 
  Former Deputy Prime Minister Shin Kanemaru, called the 
"foster parent" of the politician Ichiro Ozawa, used the 
following expression in describing his own exquisite political 
skill (quintessence): "It should be used in such a way that when 
you look like your are beating, you are in fact rubbing, and 
when you look like you are rubbing, you are indeed beating." 
  This method was crystalized into an "adjustment-oriented 
careful politics" of former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, a 
sworn friend of Mr. Kanemaru's. In retrospect, the method 
represented the Tanaka faction's traditional family art 
originating in Mr. Tanaka. Then, why has a mutant species or a 
heterogeneous "devil" like Mr. Ozawa appeared in the chain of 
people connected with the Tanaka lineage. 
  In the midst of the effort to choose former Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's successor, Mr. Ozawa told with a touch of 
excitement: "The tide of the times cannot be checked. It is 
flowing faster than I expect." What Mr. Ozawa calls "the tide of 
the times" is a major prerequisite to turning Japan into "an 
ordinary nation." The tide means the great political 
restructuring involving the LDP. Mr. Ozawa was probably excited 
by the self-awareness that he would have to "lead the tide of 
the times." Such an "obsession with an idea" is a valuable thing 
for a political leader at a turning point in history; however, 
it is also accompanied with a danger in case the political 
leader mishandles the situation. 
  Nevertheless, I would like to pay attention to Mr. Ozawa's 
"obsession with an idea" because I can use it as a "coordinate 
axis" in studying the politician "Ichiro Ozawa" in this article. 
It is because, when viewed from this angle, "a continuation of 
failures and the immaturity of political technique" as noted in 
the Ozawa criticisms may not have great significance for Mr. 
Ozawa. I say this on the ground that, if necessary for the 
attainment of the ultimate goal, Mr. Ozawa would possibly opt 
for "a continuation of failures" rather than for "small 
achievements." 
  In this sense, Mr. Ozawa's "political immaturity" resembles 
the "immaturity" peculiar to fundamentalism. This immaturity is 
also common to fundamentalist Shoin Yoshida who switched the 
course of a historic turnabout toward the Meiji Restoration. 
  What is interesting about Mr. Ozawa's apparent 
"fundamentalism" is that it thoroughly pits the image of "a 
president-type (top-down) leader"--as once advocated by former 
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone--against the image of "an 
adjustment-oriented (bottom-up) leader," which was in line with 
Japan's political principle and upheld by Shin Kanemaru and 
Noboru Takeshita. This "Japanese political principle versus 
American rationalism" diagram is a characteristic of all 
policies and ideals envisaged in Mr. Ozawa's "ordinary nation" 
theory. That is, fundamental portions of a prescription for 
realizing the ordinary nation, in fact, overlap the arguments by 
American rationalists or fundamentalists who are engaged in 
Japan bashing. 
  The secrets of the politician Ichiro Ozawa's "strongness" 
lie 
in his possession by the spirit of rationalism identified with 
American fundamentalism. Therefore, as long as the United States 
tenaciously asks Japan to "open its market" and "abolish 
collusive politics " (finance ministry-led politics), Mr. 
Ozawa's tenacity for reforming the present status will remain 
unchanged. Moreover, the reason why Mr. Ozawa can revive each 
time despite "a continuation of failures" is that international 
frictions symbolically shown between Japan and the United States 
constitute an incessant source of energy supply to the type of 
"fundamentalism" seen in Ichiro Ozawa. 
  However, Mr. Ozawa being viewed as a "fundamentalist" is, of 
course, not simply because he speaks for European and U.S. 
rationalism as past modernists did. It is also because he is 
concealing in his inmost heart the desire to "surpass" 
rationalism sooner or later. This is why Washington does not 
stop keeping a vigilant eye on Mr. Ozawa. 
  Among Japanese politicians, no one will perceive with a 
greater sense of strain than Mr. Ichiro Ozawa the great changes 
in international politics since the collapse of the Berlin Wall 
and the Gulf war, whether they are favorable or unfavorable 
changes. Concerning such political methods by Mr. Ozawa, Former 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura (leader of Sakigake) 
criticizes that "he is a hard-boiled man and does things too 
hastily." Then, what is Mr. Takemura's view of the times? 
  Mr. Takemura called Mr. Ozawa the advocate of "national 
rights theory," while calling himself the advocate of "civil 
rights theory." In a recent television program, there was a 
scene in which political scientist Masataka Takasaka severely 
reproved Mr. Takemura for this comparison, saying that "you 
should not make an ambiguous comparison by using historic 
conceptions." Mr. Takasaka, perhaps, felt like asking Mr. 
Takemura if he could understand mental confusions Yukichi 
Fukuzawa underwent when he had to move from the position of 
"civil rights theory" to that of "national rights theory" in the 
face of the Sino-Japanese War. The two ideas should not be 
grasped merely as static, mutually opposing ones; instead, 
politicians should live together with the touch-and-go strains 
created between the two ideas. By so doing, politicians will see 
the birth of their realism and their idealist reality. 
  The North Korean nuclear and missile development issue and 
the improvement of Japan's system for emergency are important 
test cases in which Japanese politicians--a little crazed from 
the long peacetime--can outgrow their former selves and become 
true political realists. It is not the "ideas smacking of Ichiro 
Ozawa" that is dangerous. Dangerous are the politicians who well 
never be able to possess dynamism with which to live amid 
strained relations between "national rights" and "civil 
rights"--though this inability is characteristic of factions 
calling for the defense of the Constitution and postwar pacifist 
groups. What is worse, such politicians are squatting across the 
LDP and the SDPJ.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Home Affairs Minister Hajime 
Ishii said Friday [3 June] he has given up the chairmanship of a 
group of Japanese legislators promoting friendship with North 
Korea "to avoid misunderstanding" amid calls for Tokyo to take a 
tougher line against Pyongyang over its suspected nuclear arms 
development. 
  "I have not harbored any intentions of viewing South Korea 
as 
an enemy or siding with North Korea," Ishii, who had served as 
chairman of the Dietmen's League for Promotion of Japan-Korea 
Friendship, told a news conference. 
  Ishii, concurrently serving as chairman of the National 
Public Safety Commission, has been under pressure from the No. 1 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party to quit the chairmanship in 
view of his status as a cabinet minister and head of the 
commission in charge of gathering intelligence on North Korean 
agents. "I have to avoid misunderstanding as chairman of the 
National Public Safety Commission amid the North Korean 
(nuclear) issue and domestic issues," he said. 
  The LOS ANGELES TIMES and some Japanese media have claimed 
that the presence of Ishii and other alleged supporters of North 
Korea in the ruling coalition would deter it from regulating the 
flow of money to the isolated communist nation from 
pro-Pyongyang Korean residents of Japan.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Japan will send former 
Ambassador to the United States Nobuo Matsunaga to Paris as a 
special government envoy to attend a forthcoming ministerial 
meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD), a trade ministry official said Friday [3 
June]. 
  Matsunaga will attend the two-day conference, which begins 
next Tuesday, in place of the three cabinet ministers who have 
been forced to skip the OECD meeting due to a tight 
parliamentary schedule, the official at the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry said. 
  It has been customary for Japan to send the chiefs of MITI, 
the Foreign Ministry and the Economic Planning Agency to the 
annual OECD meeting. 
  All of the Group of Seven major industrial countries except 
Japan will dispatch cabinet ministers to this year's gathering, 
which will focus on three key topics of growth and employment, 
reinforcing multilateral trade systems and a new role of the 
OECD amid the rapid change in the international situation.

<F P=106> [By Miu Oikawa Dieter] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Striving to boost its 
international contributions as it aims to acquire a permanent 
seat on the UN Security Council, Japan has begun weighing the 
possibility of joining another UN-led peacekeeping operation. 
  Under consideration is participation by the Self-Defense 
Forces (SDF) in a Canadian logistics battalion operating under 
the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in the Golan 
Heights, an area occupied by Israel since it seized the 
territory from Syria in 1967. 
  The United Nations has informally requested Japan to 
shoulder 
some functions of the Canadian logistics battalion after Ottawa 
decided to cut down the scale of its peacekeeping operations due 
to financial difficulties, according to government officials. 
Tokyo is expected to start looking into the specifics of 
whether it can actually take part in the operations when a 
government mission returns from Canada in mid-June. The 
seven-member team is to study in Canada the details of the 
logistics activities under UNDOF. If Japan decides to join 
UNDOF, it will be its third participation in UN peacekeeping 
operations, following a mission to Cambodia in 1992 and one to 
Mozambique to end next February. 
  "No decisions have been made yet," said a Foreign Ministry 
official. "The aim of dispatching the mission to Canada is 
simply to explore the possibilities of the participation (in 
UNDOF)." But according to some ministry officials, peacekeeping 
in the Golan Heights seems to top the list of candidates for the 
next destination for Japanese peacekeepers. 
  The 1,036-strong UNDOF, comprising infantry corps from 
Austria and Poland and the 215-member logistical personnel from 
Canada, has been monitoring the cease-fire and disengagement 
between Israel and Syria since June 1974 after the Middle East 
War in 1973. The Canadian team engages in transportation, 
communications, fixing vehicles and supplying food. 
  The ministry officials said UNDOF is one of a handful among 
17 UN peacekeeping activities now operating worldwide that fits 
Japan's five conditions for joining such operations, including 
the requirement of a cease-fire among warring parties. Earlier 
this year, when Japan explored ways to step up contributions to 
the former Yugoslavia, the lack of a cease-fire agreement there 
prevented Japan from joining the Zagreb-based UN Protection 
Force. Among those meeting Japan's criteria are the UN 
operations in Cyprus, in the Kashmir region bordered by India 
and Pakistan and at the Iraq-Kuwait border. "We're not thinking 
of sending Japanese personnel to every one of the UN 
peacekeeping operations matching Japan's conditions," said a 
ministry official. 
  ``We have to think whether Japan can win high evaluation 
from the international community by participating in that 
particular peacekeeping operation, whether it could gain the 
public's understanding while also considering the political 
meaning of taking part in it,'' the official said on condition 
of anonymity. 
  Cambodia and Mozambique both fulfilled such conditions, he 
said. The mission to Cambodia, where SDF members were dispatched 
abroad for the first time, contributed to the peace and 
stability in Asia, while joining the Mozambique operation showed 
Japan's interest in problems worldwide, he said. 
  The U.N.-sponsored peacekeeping mission to the Golan Heights 
also meets such conditions, the official said. 
  Participation in UNDOF could prove Japan is not reluctant to 
join peacekeeping operations in other parts of the world besides 
Asia, he said. 
  Tokyo could also make an international showing that it is 
eager to promote the peace process in the region, when new moves 
are beginning to emerge in the process, the official said. 
  Also, because Israel and Syria are friendly with Japan and 
because peace and stability of the Middle East region are 
important globally, participation in such an operation could 
gain public understanding, he said. 
  Another factor in favor of the dispatch to the 
Damascus-based 
UNDOF is a lesson learned from the 1991 Gulf war, the official 
said. 
  Despite contributions totaling 13 billion dollars to the 
multilateral forces and frontline nations, Japan faced 
international criticism for not sending its own personnel and 
conducting ``cash diplomacy,'' he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Japan on Friday [3 June] 
expressed support for a U.N. Security Council resolution which 
called for a cease-fire in Yemen's month-old civil war, and 
strongly urged all parties concerned to comply with the 
resolution. 
  In a Foreign Ministry statement read by spokesman Terusuke 
Terada, the Japanese Government expressed "deep regret" that 
large- scale armed conflicts in Yemen, which broke out on May 4, 
have caused a number of civilian casualties and damaged Yemen's 
nation- building efforts to which Japan has greatly contributed. 
  Japan has supported the unity and democratization of Yemen 
and a peaceful settlement of the problems through dialogue among 
all those concerned, it said. 
  Tokyo supports the U.N. Resolution 924 adopted Wednesday and 
welcomes Yemen's declaration confirming its acceptance and its 
readiness to implement the resolution, the statement said. 
  Japan strongly hopes that all those concerned will earnestly 
comply with the resolution, it said. 
  The socialist South Yemen and conservative North Yemen 
merged 
on May 22, 1990. But civil war erupted in early May after 
months of increasing tension, with southerners accusing the 
north of trying to dominate the republic.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Japan should step up its 
economic cooperation to other Asian countries as a way to help 
revitalize the global economy, the fiscal 1994 white paper on 
economic cooperation released Friday [3 June] said. 
  Japan has a responsibility to activate the world economy by 
supporting ongoing self-help efforts among Asian economies to 
maintain and expand their "growth dynamism," said the annual 
report. 
  To that aim, an international division of roles needs to be 
promoted on the investment and trade fronts, the white paper 
said, calling for Japan to expand direct investment in and 
imports from Asia. 
  The white paper, prepared by the International Trade and 
Industry Ministry, described the newly industrializing economies 
(NIES) in Asia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) as "the growth center for world economic development." 
  "Such a dynamism in the areas has resulted from an effective 
use of market mechanism and an increased linkage with the rest 
of the world in trade and investment," said the white paper. 
  This year's white paper paid particular attention to China, 
Vietnam and India, devoting much space to analyzing various 
problems involved in economic reform efforts in these countries. 
  China, touted as having the biggest growth potential in the 
world, scored a significant real economic growth of a 13.4 
percent in 1993 thanks to the increased use of market mechanism. 
  But the paper cited the need for infrastructure improvement 
in the country, especially in the inland area, in order to 
correct its economic gap with the rapidly growing coastal area. 
  The white paper said Vietnam should effectively use aid 
funds 
extended by Japan and other countries for improvement in 
economic infrastructure, and lagging legal and administrative 
systems. 
  The Vietnamese Government also needs to make further efforts 
in placing economically inefficient state-owned corporations 
into private management, it said. 
  As for India, the white paper said its legal system has been 
upgraded under the ongoing reform program. But further efforts, 
particularly deregulation, need to be done in financial and farm 
sectors, it said. 
  The paper also sees the need for India to improve its 
infrastructure in utilities, traffic systems and 
telecommunications networks. 
  These efforts would help rectify an inadequate allocation of 
wealth among the Indian people, eventually contributing to 
higher productivity, the white paper said. 
  Japan should formulate economic cooperation programs for 
other Asian countries while clarifying problems these countries 
are facing domestically, it said. 
  Assistance to them also should be made in a manner that 
ensures harmonization with global trade accords recently 
concluded under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade 
negotiations, the paper said. 
  The paper noted that Japan's economic assistance in 1992 
decreased 36.3 percent to 15,944 million dollars, with a smooth 
growth in official development assistance (ODA) more than offset 
by a substantial drop in private-sector aid. 
  Japan's ODA for the year increased 2.7 percent to 11,332 
million dollars. The sum was the largest in the world, 
accounting for 18.5 percent of the global ODA.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- The House of Representatives 
Budget Committee decided Thursday [2 June] night to summon a 
former high-ranking trade ministry official as a witness to 
explain why he was dismissed last year by then Trade Minister 
Hiroshi Kumagai. 
  Committee chairman Tsuruo Yamaguchi announced he will go 
along with opposition demands that Masahisa Naito, former head 
of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's Industrial 
Policy Bureau, appear before the panel on Monday to explain why 
he was sacked by MITI Minister Kumagai. 
  Kumagai reportedly fired Naito for his alleged favoritism in 
personnel matters within MITI. 
  The demands by the two largest opposition parties -- the 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) -- stalled Diet proceedings, and the ruling minority 
coalition finally relented. 
  During the budget panel's Thursday morning session, LDP 
lawmaker Kiyoshi Mizuno blasted Kumagai, currently chief cabinet 
secretary, for his alleged conspiracy to get rid of Naito by 
distributing defamatory pamphlets critical of Naito.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- A senior Japanese trade 
ministry official said Thursday [2 June] the ministry has fully 
explained a personnel controversy that took place last year. 
  "So I have no additional comments," said Hideaki Kumano, 
vice 
international trade and industry minister, referring to what 
ended in the voluntary resignation of a ministry bureau chief. 
  Speaking to reporters, Kumano said, "I want to refrain from 
specific comments on the matter because the issue is very 
delicate." 
  The remark came after parliamentary business stalled earlier 
in the day due to renewed bickering over last December's 
controversy at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI). 
  In mid-December, Hiroshi Kumagai, chief cabinet secretary 
and 
then MITI minister, asked Masahisa Naito, head of MITI's 
Industrial Policy Bureau, to step down to take the blame for an 
allegedly unfair promotion he gave to a MITI official who was 
leaving the ministry to run in a national election. 
  The request, which ended in Naito's voluntary resignation, 
prompted public criticism regarding political interference in 
the bureaucracy. 
  Naito, tipped as a likely choice for the next vice MITI 
minister, said such a promotion was customary at MITI for 
officials who leave to run in elections. 
  Kumano said MITI's director of the secretariat clarified the 
situation surrounding the resignation at a House of 
Representatives Budget Committee meeting Wednesday and Thursday. 
  Thursday's lower house budgetary committee meeting stalled 
following the coalition parties' rejection of an opposition 
demand that Naito be summoned to the Diet to give details about 
the personnel controversy. 
  Naito, who is now in the United States, was quoted as saying 
by an opposition interpellator during the committee session that 
he is prepared to return home "tomorrow." 
  Kumagai said at his last news conference as MITI chief in 
April that his resignation request to Naito was necessary to 
"rejuvenate the management of MITI." 
  The latest development over the MITI controversy came in 
connection with the question of whether Kumano will retain the 
current post of vice MITI chief in an overall personnel 
reshuffle to be made shortly. 
  Some within MITI have said he should resign to take 
responsibility for causing the controversy.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Eijiro Hata, minister of 
international trade and industry [MITI], said Friday [3 June] he 
is gravely concerned that the latest development in his 
ministry's personnel affair could shake an already fragile 
cabinet. 
  "The situation is very abnormal," the MITI minister said. He 
was referring to a parliamentary accord to summon a former 
high-ranking ministry official to the Diet to clarify his sudden 
resignation last December. 
  Masahisa Naito, the former head of MITI's Industrial Policy 
Bureau, will appear before the Diet next Monday as an unsworn 
witness to speak about the circumstances that led to his 
resignation last December. 
  In mid-December, Hiroshi Kumagai, chief cabinet secretary 
and 
then trade minister, forced Naito to step down over his alleged 
bias in the appointment of an official who planned to leave the 
ministry to run in national elections. 
  Naito has denied the allegation, saying the special 
promotion 
of a retiring official has been customary at MITI. But he 
finally agreed to resign, apparently bowing to strong pressure 
from Kumagai. 
  The incident prompted strong public criticism that branded 
Kumagai's resignation request as politician's interference in 
bureaucracy. 
  The renewed bickering over the controversy stalled 
parliamentary business Thursday. 
  Speaking before a press conference, MITI chief Hata said his 
ministry will "calmly" watch developments in the matter. 
  Hata said he understands the former trade minister's 
resignation request was intended to "rejuvenate MITI." 
  On Thursday, some opposition camp members called for 
Kumagai's resignation, a key cabinet minister under the minority 
Hata government.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- A government panel released 
a rough outline Thursday [2 June] for the boundaries of 300 new 
single-seat constituencies for the House of Representatives. 
  The group will begin drawing up concrete boundaries for the 
electoral districts after submitting the outline to the lower 
house special committee on political reform, government 
officials said. 
  The ruling coalition wants the panel to report as early as 
Monday so that a bill can be enacted during the current Diet 
session which ends in late June, but the main opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) has insisted on June 9 or later, 
political sources said. 
  A new electoral system was enacted in January, but it will 
not take effect unless the boundaries for the new electoral 
districts become law. 
  The outline provides a basic policy for defining 
constituencies, the officials said. 
  It suggests that cities, wards, towns, villages and counties 
should not be divided into two constituencies, and detached 
districts should be avoided. 
  Social and natural conditions, including geography, history 
and transportation, should be considered in drawing up the 
boundaries of the constituencies, it said. 
  The panel, headed by Tadao Ishikawa, former president of 
Keio 
University, was launched on April 11. 
  Under the new electoral system, 300 of the 500 lower house 
members will be elected from single-seat districts and the 
remaining 200 through proportional representation. 
  The current 511-seat House of Representatives was elected 
last July from constituencies supplying two to six members each.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- The Tokyo High Court 
rejected Friday [3 June] a plea by voters to invalidate the 1993 
general election in which the weight of a vote in a sparsely 
populated constituency was nearly three times as much as that in 
a densely inhabited electorate. 
  Presiding Judge Shigeru Sato said in the ruling the vote 
disparity of 2.88 to 1 "cannot be ruled unconstitutional in view 
of the preceding decisions by the supreme court." The ruling 
cited the highest judicial body's 1985 decision that said a 
maximum disparity of 2.92 to 1 is constitutional as well as a 
1993 decision that found a gap of 2.99 constitutional. 
  However, Sato said the Diet should observe the principle of 
equality under which the weight of a vote in a certain 
constituency should not be double that of a vote in another. 
The judge also urged a government panel -- now commissioned 
with redistricting the current multiseat constituencies for the 
511-seat House of Representatives into 300 single-seat 
electorates -- to pare down the disparity to less than 2 to 1. 
  The ruling was made in response to a lawsuit filed last year 
by a group of 72 voters from 16 constituencies in Kanagawa, 
Tokyo, Chiba and Saitama Prefectures, who said the 1993 general 
election was unconstitutional because of the 2.82 disparity. 
The group of plaintiffs was spearheaded by Kiyoshi Miyagawa, a 
Dokkyo University professor, a resident of Chiba's No. 4 
constituency, as well as attorney Yasushi Koshiyama, a voter in 
Tokyo's No. 3 constituency. 
  Miyagawa has condemned as unconstitutional the current legal 
provision that allows the Diet to allocate to constituencies 
seats whose numbers are often disproportionate to the number of 
registered voters. 
  The plaintiffs said they will appeal the ruling to the 
supreme court. The latest ruling was made when a panel of 
experts named by the previous government is trying to demarcate 
the 300 new single- seat constituencies so that the next Japan's 
next general election could be held under the new voting system. 
  The Home Affairs Ministry has reportedly said that whittling 
down disparity in the weight of votes among the 300 single-seat 
constituencies to less than 2 to 1 may be unattainable due to 
limitations associated with a new electoral map being worked out 
on the basis of the package of electorate change bills 
legislated in January.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- A friendship promotion 
organization headed by Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], received 100 million yen as a 
donation from the construction industry in 1991, sources said 
Thursday [2 June]. 
  The Japan Federation of Construction Contractors 
(Nikkenren), 
which groups 57 building firms, contributed a total of 100 
million yen to John Manjiro No Kai, a nonprofit organization to 
boost grass- roots exchanges between Japan and the United 
States, sources said. 
  The revelation could provide ammunition to opposition 
parties 
that are renewing a call for Ozawa's Diet testimony over 
suspected donations from scandal-tainted general contractors, 
observers said. 
  A group of 23 individuals filed a complaint in February with 
public prosecutors against Ozawa, accusing him of illegally 
receiving a 5 million yen political donation in December 1992. 
  Ozawa, former secretary general of the Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP), has denied the charge. 
  The friendship organization, established in November 1990, 
when Ozawa was the LDP secretary general, sought donations from 
businesses to host a November 1991 conference to boost 
Japan-U.S. grass-roots exchanges. 
  Nobuo Matsunaga, the organization's director and former 
ambassador to the U.S., brought a request for donations to then 
Nikkenren chairman Teruzo Yoshino, former chairman of Shimizu 
Corp. 
  In response, the Nikkenren member companies contributed 1.5 
million to 3.5 million yen each to Ozawa's organization. 
  Many major construction companies have been involved in a 
bribery and bid-rigging scandal that has claimed four regional 
government leaders, a former construction minister and more than 
30 exeutives from Japan's eight biggest building firms. 
  Nikkenren defended the 1991 donation as a good-will 
contribution for advancing international exchanges. 
  "Japan's construction industry was then in a difficult 
position due to the Japan-U.S. construction talks, and we 
donated the money in a belief that grass-roots exchanges between 
the two countries are important," one Nikkenren official said. 
  He admitted the construction group was aware that Ozawa 
headed the organization. 
  Sadao Hirano, a Shinseito member of the House of Councillors 
and acting chairman of the organization, said, "It was a project 
supported by the Foreign Ministry on the occasion of the 50th 
anniversary of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor." 
  He added that the construction companies contributed because 
"they shared our view." 
  John Manjiro No Kai, which later developed into a fund 
approved by six ministries, continues to sponsor an annual 
grass-roots summit, held alternately in Japan and the U.S.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- The Ministry of Finance 
[MOF] revised its tax reform estimates Thursday [2 June] amid 
criticism over its earlier ones, adding a sales tax hike to 4-6 
percent and extending maturity of stopgap bonds to 20 years. 
  The report, submitted to the government's tax commission and 
the ruling coalition, also adds miscellaneous increases and 
decreases in government spending to dodge the criticism that the 
ministry intentionally excluded specific items and limited 
conditions for its estimates. 
  The ruling parties and the advisory tax panel to the prime 
minister urged the ministry to make such additional estimates. 
  The earlier estimates presented last Friday only included a 
consumption tax hike to 7-10 percent from the current 3 percent, 
and limited the maturity for stopgap bonds to 10 years. 
  The stopgap bonds are to fund a three-year time lag on 
conditions of continuing 6.2 trillion yen in tax cuts, including 
5.5 trillion yen cuts in income and residents' taxes, and hiking 
the consumption tax. 
  With the tax cuts now limited to the current fiscal year, 
Japan vowed in its March market-opening package to decide by the 
end of June on a full-fledged tax reform led by semipermanent 
tax cuts. 
  Under the revised report, the ministry estimates a revenue 
deficit of 6.4 trillion yen to 11.3 trillion yen in fiscal 2000 
with a hike in the consumption tax to 4-6 percent to cover the 
tax cuts, bond redemption, and expected increases in social 
welfare spending. 
  For a hike to 7-9 percent, it estimates a deficit of 0.5 
trillion yen to 5.3 trillion yen. 
  A increase to 10 percent is the only estimate with revenue 
surplus, ranging from 0.7 trillion yen to 1.6 trillion yen.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- A subcommittee of a ruling 
coalition panel on tax reforms on Thursday [2 June] proposed 
overhauling the present tax privileges for small businesses as a 
precondition for raising the consumption tax from the present 3 
percent. 
  The group made the proposal in a draft report on tax 
reforms, 
including a continuation of income tax cuts beyond this fiscal 
year and a raise in the consumption tax. 
  Regarding tax privileges for small businesses in connection 
with the consumption tax, the subcommittee proposed overhauling 
the present system of applying reduced tax rates to businesses 
with taxable annual sales of less than 50 million yen. 
  The report, however, made no mention of the margin of a 
raise 
in the consumption tax. Members had failed to reach agreement 
on the matter, officials said. 
  The subcommittee will submit its final report to the tax 
reform panel around June 9 after coordinating its views, and the 
coalition will use the report to work out basic guidelines for 
tax reforms by the end of this month, the officials said. 
  The draft report also suggested that the income threshold 
for 
taxation be raised to offset the effects of a higher consumption 
tax on low income earners.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- A subcommittee of the ruling 
coalition proposed that 92 government-backed corporations be 
abolished or consolidated in the coming years as part of 
administrative and fiscal reforms, according to an interim 
report made Thursday [2 June]. 
  The group is expected to submit a final report on the 
subject 
on June 9 to the coalition's consultation group on tax reforms. 
  The group offered no conclusion in its report on the 
proposed 
establishment of a Public Works Ministry to consolidate six 
ministries and agencies, including the Construction Ministry, 
the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry and the 
National Land Agency. 
  It proposed reorganization of government-backed 
corporations, 
such as Housing and Urban Development Corp., under these and 
other principles: 
  -- Those engaged in similar business activities should be 
consolidated. 
  -- Those operating in local regions should be reorganized 
into a national corporation. 
  -- Those that can achieve financial independence should be 
privatized.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Japan should further 
deregulate the economy to help cut its trade surplus, boost 
consumer purchasing power and expand business opportunities, the 
Bank of Japan (BOJ) said Thursday [2 June]. 
  "Deregulation will contribute to a swift adjustment of 
Japan's economy" as structural economic changes proceed 
worldwide, the central bank in its annual review of monetary and 
economic developments for the fiscal year through March. 
  It said easing curbs that cause economic inefficiencies will 
help bring balance to what it called Japan's excessive savings 
and insufficient investment. That would address the structural 
element of Japan's large external surplus, it said. 
  Japan has amassed a large external surplus while domestic 
"social infrastructure and housing stock are relatively poor by 
international standards," the report notes. 
  As trade expands with the booming economies of East Asia, 
the 
report says, deregulation will help allocate resources more 
efficiently, improving purchasing power through lower prices and 
expanding business opportunities and new industries, it says. 
  The report notes the hollowing out of Japanese industry, 
with 
auto and electrical appliance production shifting to East Asia 
as the yen surges and those countries augment their low-wage 
advantages with increased technological capability. 
  Japanese manufacturers are thus under pressure to emphasize 
"technology-intensive goods production," the BOJ says. 
  The high yen, lower overseas costs and deregulation are 
forcing prices down in the nonmanufacturing sector, it says. 
That will boost real household income eventually but force more 
corporate restructuring, the report says. 
  Adjustments in the global industrial structure, as well as 
domestic stock and balance-sheet adjustments, have prolonged and 
deepened Japan's recession, the report says. 
  In judging Japan's economy, the report mirrors other recent 
assessments by the BOJ and its governor, Yasushi Mieno. 
  "A greater number of economic indicators have recently 
improved, and the economy appears to have stopped weakening," it 
says. "The pace of recovery will likely be slow, however, in 
light of balance- sheet adjustments and the drastic changes in 
the industrial structure that are underway." 
  With their balance sheets battered by bad loans left from 
the 
collapse of the late 1980s speculative "bubble," financial 
institutions have been less able to take risks, the report says. 
That apparently contributed to low fiscal 1993 growth in bank 
lending and money supply, it says. 
  But "the extent to which the balance sheet problem has 
influenced economic growth is uncertain," the report adds. 
  The BOJ also says banks and other institutions "seem to have 
become more willing to enhance long-term competitiveness by 
making active writeoffs" of the bad loans they hold. But it 
says more time will be needed to finish writing off the bad 
loans. 
  Rises this year in long-term interest rates reflected a 
market correction from earlier large falls and the rises were 
sustained by hopes of economic improvement, it said. 
  The BOJ's own record-low discount rate and other easy money 
policies have "given underlying strength to the economy" by 
boosting housing investment and corporate profits and laid the 
grounds for corporate and financial restructuring, the report 
says.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- The Japanese Government and 
the ruling coalition parties agreed early Friday not to cut the 
government purchase price for wheat in fiscal 1994, government 
sources said. 
  The government purchase price, or producers' price, will 
stay 
unchanged for the third consecutive year despite the 
government's desire to cut the price. Mutsuki Kato, minister of 
agriculture, forestry and fisheries, will refer the agreement to 
the rice price council at a meeting to be held later in the day, 
the sources said. 
  The government had wanted to narrow the price gap between 
Japan and other countries. The price of domestic wheat is said 
five times higher than the price of imported grains. But the 
coalition parties, which were backed by wheat producers opposed 
to the price cut, claimed a cut would weaken production capacity. 
  The wheat price was cut for six years in a row from 1986. 
The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) were also opposed to the price cut for fiscal 1994. The 
council will apparently decide the wheat price on the advice of 
the ministry.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- An agreement to leave 
government-set wheat prices unchanged for fiscal 1994 will not 
affect later negotiations for rice prices, Finance Minister 
Hirohisa Fujii said Friday [3 June]. The wheat-price accord 
reached earlier Friday by the government and the ruling parties 
was the "utmost decision," Fujii said at a news conference after 
a morning cabinet meeting, 
  Under the accord, the price the government pays to farmers 
for wheat will be frozen for the third consecutive year. 
Conditions for setting wheat prices are different from those 
for rice prices, Fujii said. "We must work to win the support 
of growers and the public" on rice prices, he added. The area 
under cultivation for wheat is on the decline and "simple 
calculations" based on supply and demand indicate a need for a 
price cut, he said. 
  Strong opposition within the ruling coalition parties to a 
cut in the price paid to wheat growers resulted in the accord to 
freeze prices. The government's policy is to lower prices to 
narrow the gap between prices at home and abroad. Japan's 
government-set wheat prices are about five times world market 
levels. Fiscal 1994 government purchase prices for rice will be 
decided in early July. 
  Asked about a reported threat by the national tax 
administration agency to withhold licenses to sell beer from 
leading supermarket chain Daiei Inc., Fujii said he knew nothing 
about it but would look into the matter. Agency officials 
reportedly told Daiei that its plans to reduce retail beer 
prices despite a recent beer tax hike are "making it difficult" 
for the agency to grant licenses to sell alcoholic beverages to 
new stores to be opened by Daiei. 
  Fujii said price-setting is "basically free," but that beer 
is "one of the special products that involves various social 
problems such as underage drinking and alcoholism."

  [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Japan's economic planning 
chief Yoshio Terasawa lamented Friday [3 June] as 
"old-fashioned" and a "waste" the nation's male-dominated hiring 
practices. The director general of the Economic Planning Agency 
(EPA) said he told other cabinet members that "Japan is strange" 
in not hiring large numbers of women as a matter of course, as 
he said U.S. and European banks and securities firms do. 
  Terasawa did not offer statistics on foreign hiring 
practices 
but told a regular news conference he was giving his impression 
from more than 20 years in the United States, including a stint 
as vice president of Nomura Securities Co. and head of its U.S. 
subsidiary. "It's obvious there are a lot of excellent women," 
but corporate hiring practices hold them back, he said. "It's 
certainly a waste for Japan's excellent women." 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata sought the cooperation of all 
related ministers at a gathering after the morning cabinet 
meeting to promote fairer hiring of women, according to top 
government spokesman Hiroshi Kumagai. Hata said women must be 
allowed to participate equally in various sectors of society to 
demonstrate their abilities, said Kumagai, chief cabinet 
secretary and minister in charge of women's issues, at a 
separate news conference. 
  Terasawa, citing Japanese corporate hiring quotas for each 
sex among business school graduates, said, "it's old-fashioned 
to say, 'how many men and how many women.' " 
  Labor Minister Kunio Hatoyama agreed in principle, Terasawa 
said, but responded that if companies don't allot a certain 
number of spaces for women, "they'll end up (hiring) all men."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Reflex of a Ruling Crisis"] </F>
  [Text] According to reports, traitor Kim Yong-sam ordered 
the entire Army and police to be put on a special and emergency 
alert beginning 31 May due to his overseas trip. Those who are 
called major commanders, accordingly, assumed a 24-hour 
standing-by posture at communication stations and the entire 
puppet Armed Forces assumed a combat posture. Also, the police 
are even more frenzied in fascist oppression. 
  This is an intolerable criminal act aimed at further 
aggravating tensions by raising an outcry over us. 
  The puppets are talking as if these measures were needed 
because of someone's possible southward invasion, but this is a 
preposterous sophistry that cannot convince anybody. 
  As everyone knows, there is no threat of a southward 
invasion 
on the Korean peninsula. The puppets have been advertising a 
threat of southward invasion for the past scores of years, but 
it has never existed. This is demonstrated well by the many 
peace proposals we put forward and the fact that the South side 
was urged to accede to the proposal for a national meeting 
without hesitation at the conference of the government, 
political parties, and social organizations of the Republic 
recently held in Pyongyang. 
  In fact, there is no southward invasion, but only a threat 
of 
a northward invasion posed by the U.S. imperialists and their 
puppet Kim Yong-sam group exists on the Korean peninsula. This 
is admitted [kongin] by the world. 
  The U.S. imperialists are openly saying that they are ready 
for a war [chongjaengdo pulsa hageddago], mobilizing large scale 
updated war equipment and troops on and around the Korean 
peninsula over our so-called nuclear issue. The puppet Armed 
Forces have assumed a mobilization posture so as to immediately 
begin a war upon receiving an order. They also conduct 
large-scale joint landing operations aimed at a northward 
invasion and conduct frequent exercises to pass through the 
Military Demarcation Line. All these facts clearly show who is 
actually aggravating tensions and increasing the danger of 
invasion on the Korean peninsula. 
  The puppets' outcry over us is nothing but a ruse for 
deceiving [kiman] public opinion at home and abroad and for 
justifying their war commotion for a northward invasion. 
  Why then are South Korean puppets making a stir with a 
special and emergency alert order for the entire puppet Army and 
police? This is because their aim is to bolster [kochwi] the 
South Korean people's sense of confrontation [taegyol uisik], 
with the puppet traitor's overseas trip as momentum, and at 
frazzling [hanchung to kinjangsikyoso] the situation aggravated 
by themselves and driving it to a war phase. 
  This is proved by the following facts: Kim Yong-sam called a 
security-related ministers meeting a few days ago and made very 
belligerent outbursts [hojonjok pogon] that a 24-hour alert 
posture should be assumed, that the South Korean-U.S. joint 
alert posture should be strengthened, and so on. In his 
so-called statement addressed to the people that followed the 
meeting, he loudly talked about the need for the people to have 
a firm security sense and security posture. 
  This is not the only aim the puppets are pursuing. Traitor 
Kim Yong-sam has begun an overseas trip, but he feels uneasy. 
As everyone knows, South Korean people of various classes and 
strata are waging a large-scale struggle against the 
agricultural market opening, the antiwar and antinuclear 
struggle, the wage struggle, and the struggle for the 
fatherland's reunification all over the country. 
  As the South Korean economy has been ruined by businesses 
going bankrupt and inflation, the mummers of grievance of the 
people who are disenchanted [hwanmyorul nuggin] by the Kim 
Yong-sam regime is ringing all over the country. Thus, the 
puppets are suffering a serious ruling crisis [simgakhan tongchi 
wigi]. 
  Although traitor Kim Yong-sam is visiting overseas, no one 
knows what will happen in South Korea at any point. Traitor Kim 
Yong-sam's special and emergency alert order reflects this shaky 
situation [iron puransuroun chojiui panyonguroso] and it is also 
aimed at maintaining power by oppressing opposition forces 
[pandaepa seryok] with weapons [chongkallo] and by diverting the 
people's attention with other things. 
  However, this is worthless. Aggravating North-South 
relations and threatening the people with weapons will only 
result in accelerating self-ruin. 
  The South Korean people will never leave the Kim Yong-sam 
group, which makes treachery to the country and the nation its 
business, as it is [maeguk paejok haengwirul ilsamnun kim 
yong-sam iltangul choltaero kamanduji anulgosimnida].

<F P=106> ["What Is `Special Alert Order' Aimed At?" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
authorities issued "a special alert order" and "an emergency 
alert order" to the "army and police" across South Korea for the 
period from May 31 to June 7 with the traitor Kim Yong-sam 
setting out on a foreign trip. 
  A MINJU CHOSON analyst today says this is an unpardonable 
treacherous act to intentionally strain the situation on the 
Korean peninsula, incite North-South confrontation and step up 
their moves for a war against the North. 
  The news analyst goes on: 
  The puppets describe the "special alert order" as something 
to cope with the North's moves, saying its "moves" must be 
watched, making quite a noise as if any ominous event would 
break out during the traitor Kim Yong-sam's foreign tour. 
  This, however, is nothing more than a sophism designed to 
cover up their true color as the very one who is aggravating the 
situation on the Korean peninsula and racing headlong along the 
road of confrontation and war. 
  At present, the puppets are staging almost every day 
warexercises against the North including Military Demarcation 
Line (MDL) breakthrough operation exercises in areas near the 
MDL and ceaselessly committing provocations in the area along 
the MDL, at a time when the United States has deployed Patriot 
missiles and attack helicopters in South Korea and massed huge 
aggression forces in and around it. 
  The "special alert order" issued by the puppets against the 
North with the traitor Kim Yong-sam's foreign tour as an 
occasion is aimed at making the provocation of a war against the 
North a fait accompli and step up preparations for it according 
to a war policy of the U.S. imperialists. 
  It is a unanimous judgement of people at home and abroad 
that 
those who are lost to reason, driven to a tight corner, may take 
the road of unleashing a war against the North any moment. 
  That, however, can never be a way out for the puppets, and 
it 
will only precipitate their own destruction.

<F P=106> ["Sword-Brandishing by 'Civilian' Dictatorship"--KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
denounces the fascist suppression of patriotic students by the 
Kim Yong-sam group in South Korea. 
  The analyst says: 
  Recently, the Kim Yong-sam group arrested students in 
Kwangju 
on charge of the violation of "the National Security Law", after 
they opened photo exhibitions with several dozen pictures 
showing the reality of the North at Chonnam and Choson campuses 
in the period of the inaugural ceremony of the Kwangju-South 
Cholla Provincial Federation of General Student Councils. This 
was another fascist violence of the "civilian" dictators. 
  Their suppression of patriotic students who did a good thing 
for national unity and reunification fully revealed their true 
color of traitors who want neither unity nor reunification. 
  Photo exhibitions on the North had taken place even under 
the 
preceding military dictatorship in South Korea as part of "the 
movement for gaining a correct knowledge of the North." 
  While talking about "reform" and "opening," the Kim Yong-sam 
group is criminalizing the opening of such exhibitions. This 
is, indeed, a self-contradiction. 
  The fact shows that "reform" and "opening" advertized by the 
Kim Yong-sam group are nothing but a camouflage for deceiving 
the people and that South Korea is a zone of most brutal human 
rights violation and closed society of fascist dictatorship 
without an equal in the world. 
  The Kim Yong-sam fascist group must clearly see the 
situation, scrap "the National Security Law" and release the 
illegally arrested patriotic students.

<F P=106> ["Cursed Acts of 'Civilian' Dictator" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today raps 
the acts of the "civilian" dictator, Kim Yong-sam, in 
obstructing the second meeting of the joint presidium of the 
National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminnyon). 
The meeting was to be held by Pomminnyon officials of the 
North, the South and overseas through communications in 
Pyongyang, Seoul and Tokyo. 
  Recalling that the South Korean authorities on May 26, the 
day of the meeting, made a surprise raid on the office room of 
the South side's officials of Pomminnyon, searched it, seized 
documents and the telephone and cut off the telephone line by 
mobilizing scores of policemen, the news analyst continues: 
  This act of blocking even a telephone meeting proves once 
again that the South Korean society is, indeed, a closed society 
where the people are not allowed to travel their own land or 
visit fellow countrymen or converse on the telephone and that 
the South Korean authority styling himself a "civilian" ruler is 
a fascist dictator more ferocious than the preceding military 
dictators. 
  The Kim Yong-sam fascist clique, in an attempt to foil the 
meeting of the joint presidium of Pomminnyon, charged that the 
telephone meeting contravened the "National Security Law" 
prohibiting a meeting with "enemy-benefiting organizations". 
This is a cursed act that can be done only by the traitors who 
dislike reunification and this confirms once again that the Kim 
Yong-sam group is a heinous separatist group opposed to 
reunification, which regards the entire nation desirous of 
reunification as an "enemy". 
  The Kim Yong-sam group must scrap and dissolve at once such 
anti- national and anti-reunification legal and institutional 
devices as the "National Security Law" and the "Security 
Planning Board" and stop suppressing and undermining Pomminnyon.

<F P=106> ["Crafty Preach"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 29 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today hits 
out at the crafty preach of "labor-management cooperation" by 
the traitor Kim Yong-sam. 
  Preaching "labor-management cooperation" recently at the 
"new 
economy promotion council," the traitor driveled that 
"labor-management cooperation" is "an indispensable requisite" 
to serviving "the limitless competition" and he would "support" 
the enterprises successful in it. He cried that "efforts" must 
be made for "making this year the first year of labor-management 
cooperation." 
  The analyst says: 
  It is out of question for the employers and workers to 
cooperate with each other in such exploiter society as South 
Korea. It is like urging the wolf and the sheep to live in 
harmony in one pen. 
  Worse still, the traitor Kim Yong-sam cried for 
unconditional 
"cooperation" with existing labor act defending the interests of 
the employers left intact. This is tantamount to trying to 
pursuade the workers to put up with the exploitation by the 
employers, not minding the unfavorable working conditions and 
hunger wages. This is as good as preaching the workers to be 
calmly fleeced and trampled down till their death. 
  The eloquence of the traitor Kim Yong-sam about "limitless 
competition" is a tricky phraseology for lullig the resistance 
of the workers while slashing their wages. 
  The traitor's doctrine of "labor-management cooperation" is 
a 
motto of exploitation and repression veiled with the word of 
"cooperation." 
  Underlying this doctrine of traitor Kim Yong-sam is his 
ulterior intention to squeeze political fund from the employers 
by ensuring their profits.

<F P=106> ["S. Korea; Hangmen's Brutalities on Unconverted Long-term </F>
Prisoners" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- Many long-term prisoners 
including some 40 unconverted prisoners are now kept in Taejon, 
Taegu, Kwangju and other South Korean prisons. 
  Most of them are old men in their sixties, some above 80, 
kept in prison for more than 20 years in general and even 43 
years. 
  Fascist hangmen labelled those who refused to recant their 
belief as "political offenders" and have committed all sorts of 
inhumanitarian brutalities against them for scores of years, 
putting 9 to 10 prisoners in a 0.8 square metre room and even 
confining them separately in double-walled special solitary 
cells. 
  The hangmen not allowing some unconverted long-term 
prisoners 
to take exercise, meet with outsiders and receive medical 
treatment, some prisoner died to their chagrin behind bars 
without tasting a bit of medicine. 
  The fascist hangmen have made no scruples of making cripples 
of long-term prisoners or murdering them through brutal tortures. 
  Due to their inhumane tortures, Kim Yong-song was murdered, 
Son Mun-kyu killed on the spot and many other long-term 
prisoners were deprived of their lives and crippled physically. 
  It is not accidental that Kwon Nak-ki, chairman of the 
council of families of long-term prisoners under the council of 
the family movement for realizing democracy, wrote in an article 
titled "Personal History of Unconverted Long-term Prisoners Who 
Died in Prison" that many long-term prisoners lost their lives 
in prison. Their deaths were frequently dismissed as deaths from 
disease or suicide but, actually, they were murders by the 
violence of dictatorial regimes". 
  History will never pardon the South Korean fascist hangmen's 
inhumanitarian brutalities against the long-term prisoners who 
are fighting unyieldingly in defence of their faith and 
conscience.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 31 (KCNA) -- Kim Yong-ho, 
vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Social 
Democratic Party, released a statement today urging the 
political parties of South Korea to respond to the proposal for 
the convocation of a national conference at an early date. He 
said the convocation of the conference on the occasion of August 
15 this year with one year away from the 50th anniversary of the 
country's liberation, is the most positive and realistic measure 
for sidestepping the difficulties at present and opening a way 
out for the nation. 
  He accused the South Korean authorities of taking a negative 
stand toward the proposal, alleging that it is "a peaceful 
offensive," and, at the same time, keeping political parties, 
organizations and individual figures of South Korea from 
responding to the convocation of the conference. 
  The statement says: 
  "The political parties in the North and the South, which are 
responsible for the destiny of the nation and the prospect of 
the country, are obliged to play their role in the convocation 
of a national conference to remove the danger of a nuclear war 
and achieve national reunification in the '90s with concerted 
efforts. 
  "At a time when scholars, men of the press, religionists, 
women and even students in the North and the South want to meet 
with each other for reunification and are striving to realize 
dialogue for reunification, not caring for their personal 
safety, it can never be justified on all accounts that the 
political parties shun contacts. And it means avoiding their 
responsibility for the nation that they give each other a wide 
berth, putting too much stress on ideology and idea. 
  "The Korean Social Democratic Party, whose main political 
idea is independence, sovereignty, democracy, peace and defense 
of human rights, urges early bilateral contacts with political 
parties of South Korea to discuss the convocation of a national 
conference, considering it is the most positive and realistic 
measure for overcoming the difficulties at present and opening a 
way out for the nation." 
  The statement expresses the hope that contacts with 
political 
parties of South Korea will be held in Pyongyang, Seoul, 
Panmunjom or any other place in early June.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 29 (KCNA) -- So Man-sol, 
vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee of the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), in a 
statement on May 26 strongly demanded that the South Korean 
authorities affirmatively accede to the DPRK's proposal for 
convening a national conference and select delegates of the 
South side to the preparatory committee of the national 
conference at an early date to keep step with the DPRK, 
according to a KNS [Korean News Service] report from Tokyo. 
  He noted that the consultative meeting of delegates of the 
DPRK Government, political parties and public organisations 
which was held in Pyongyang on May 25 discussed all the 
questions related to the convening of the national conference, 
sent a telephone message urging the South Korean authorities to 
respond to the convening of the national conference and selected 
five delegates of the North side to the preparatory committee of 
the national conference. 
  It is no doubt that if the national conference is convened, 
a 
new phase of reconciliation and unity would be opened and a 
common way of achieving great national unity and the peace and 
Reunification of the country be found, So Man-sol said, and 
stressed: The South Korean authorities, however, are turning 
away their face from this proposal. 
  If the South Korean authorities truly think of the destiny 
of 
the country and the nation, they should give up their 
anachronistic view of confrontation, come back to the stand of 
national independence, sincerely accept the proposal of anyone 
if it is helpful to the peace and Reunification of the country 
and make no scruple of jointly opening the way of the nation.

<F P=106> ["Clumsy Trick To Mislead Public Opinion" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The Japanese authorities 
are these days noisily advertizing the "three non-nuclear 
principles" and declaring "support to an indefinite extension of 
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty" [NPT]. Commenting on this 
MINJU CHOSON today says this is intended to evade the 
international criticism of their concealment of plutonium and 
mislead international opinion which is opposed to Japan's moves 
to arm itself with nuclear weapons and become a military power. 
  The analyst says: 
  As for the "three non-nuclear principles" peddled by the 
Japanese authorities, they are a peace veil which became useless 
long ago. While advertising the "principles", Japan has connived 
at the entry of nuclear-armed U.S. warships and warplanes into 
Japan and left the Japanese territory to the United States as 
its nuclear base. 
  Lurking behind their support to the indefinite extension of 
the NPT is the clumsy trick to save themselves from the tough 
spot today when their advertisement of "uprightness" in the 
nuclear issue has turned out to be a sheer lie with the exposure 
of hidden plutonium. 
  It must not go unnoticed that the Japanese authorities and 
reactionaries are working to enact a wartime law to cope with an 
"event of contingency on the Korean peninsula" by molding the 
public opinion that the fictitious "nuclear threat" from the 
DPRK poses a grave menace to Japan's "security". 
  The Japanese authorities and reactionaries must stop their 
evil doing to harm the North over the non-existent "nuclear 
issue" and open to the world the data related to their nuclear 
issue and immediately stop nuclear armament, instead of 
advocating denuclearization only in words.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- Executive director of 
the American Committee on Korea John M. Swomley gave his 
impressions of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at a 
press conference held in Pyongyang. 
  During his visit, he said, he came to know that the Korean 
people revere and follow the great President Kim Il-song and the 
dear leader Mr. Kim Chong-il and that Korea has made a very 
rapid development after the war. 
  He said he witnessed the Korean People's Army helping the 
farmers in rice transplanting and participating in [word 
indistinct] construction, not preparations for a war. This was 
totally different from the propaganda he has heard in the United 
States, he noted. 
  Korea, he noted, is maintaining independence, attaining 
self-sufficiency in food and the Korean people are firmly 
determined, industrious and joyful people. 
  He said the Americans should know that the United States and 
South Korea built the concrete wall in the area south of the 
Military Demarcation Line which is not to be compared with the 
Berlin Wall. 
  He noted that the United States' shipment of armaments into 
South Korea well shows that it is seeking a war, not talks with 
the DPRK. 
  Pointing out that the United States most wantonly violating 
the implementation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is 
spreading the rumour of "nuclear suspicion" and putting pressure 
on Korea, while closing its eyes to the nuclear programs and 
production of Israel, South Korea and other countries, he 
described this as unreasonable. 
  Saying the aim sought by the United States is to isolate 
Korea, he called for struggling against it. 
  He contended that the third world countries should make the 
United States start nuclear disarmament and respond to 
negotiations to dismantle its nuclear weapons together with 
other nuclear states. 
  He stressed the DPRK-U.S. negotiation is the only solution 
to 
the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
today sent the high altitude strategic reconnaissance plane U-2 
deep into the sky above the territorial waters of our side in 
the East Sea to conduct aerial espionage on the Northern half of 
Korea. 
  The plane infiltrated deep into the sky above the 
territorial 
waters of our side off Tongchon on two occasions at about 12 
hours 49 minutes and 13 hours 22 minutes and conducted 
photographing and electronic espionage on the whole area and 
coastal area of the Northern half of Korea. 
  This is a deliberate and premeditated espionage of the U.S. 
imperialists in advance to invade the Northern half of Korea. 
  We cannot overlook the U.S. imperialists and their followers 
further undisguised in aerial espionage against the North, 
talking about "sanction" and "military strength" over the 
fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. 
  The U.S. imperialists must clearly see a grave consequence 
of the worsening situation in the Korean peninsula and act with 
discretion.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- A film distorting the 
history of the Korean war screened in Russia aroused a strong 
protest among people. 
  On May 21, the Russian Ostankino TV Broadcasting Station 
screened the film distorting the history of the Korean war, a 
criminal political brainchild of Dmitriy Volkogonov styling 
himself a historian. 
  The Central Committee of the Young Communist League of 
Russia 
published a statement on May 26 exposing the attempt of 
pretended historian Volkogonov to distort history at the 
biddings of a Western special agency. 
  The Korean war (1950-1953) was a war of the working people 
of 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea against the aggression 
troops, the statement said, and stressed: 
  The heroic Korean people struggled for independence and 
socialism from the beginning, holding high the banner of the 
chuche idea under the leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song. 
  The screening of such a film over Russian TV is a campaign 
for the U.S. ideological pressure on the DPRK. The statement 
demanded the Russian TV leadership to show the objective and 
historic truth of the Korean war. 
  The Young Communist League of Russia and young public 
circles 
studying the chuche idea in Moscow, together with the 
progressive young people of Russia, demand that the Russian TV 
not be allowed to screen false documents aggravating the 
international situation, stressed the statement. 
  The employees of the Vladivostok "Roza Company" in a 
statement of protest to general director of the Ostankino TV 
Broadcasting Station Yakovlev Aleksandr Nicolayevich and Dmitriy 
Volkogonov vehemently denounced Volkogonov's fabrication of 
history and truth as an unpardonable insult to the Russian 
people and the peaceloving people the world over. 
  The statement said that the Korean war was ignited by the 
U.S. imperialists and their puppets, and branded venal 
Volkogonov as a traitor of Russia and a political charlatan. 
  It sternly warned the Ostankino TV Broadcasting station not 
to libel the dignity and honor of Russia. 
  Russian citizens Kim Andrei and Maxim, Rahimbek, general 
director of the Bereke state farm in the Kazakh Republic, 
Kazakh citizen Nam Valeri and others sent letters of protest to 
the broadcasting station and Volkogonov.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The Flames of The Revolution in Light </F>
Industry Ignited by the Party"] 
  [Text] The hearts of the consumer goods producers 
throughout the country--who are effecting a new turn in carrying 
out the revolution in the light industry sector, upholding the 
historic letter, "On Thoroughly Carrying Out the Revolution in 
Light Industry," that Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear leader of 
our party and people, sent to participants of the national light 
industry meeting at the time when 30 years had passed since he 
led party work--are filled with the great dignity and pride of 
upholding the great leader [widaehan yongdoja]. 
  In his letter sent to participants of the national light 
industry meeting, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il 
indicated: Cherishing in their hearts the lofty honor and 
dignity of working in an important sector in improving the 
people's living, all functionaries and working people in the 
light industry sector should thoroughly carry out the revolution 
of light industry and, thus, should effect a decisive turn for 
development. 
  In the historic letter the dear comrade leader concretely 
elucidated the essence and task of the revolution in light 
industry and its implementation method and wisely led all 
functionaries and working people in the light industry sector to 
furiously lift up the flames of the light industry revolution in 
order to effect a great turn in the development of light 
industry and production of people's consumer goods. 
  This is a brief statement on a new development of light 
industry by Comrade Yi Sang-chun, deputy director of a bureau at 
the Committee of Light Industry. 
  [Begin Yi Sang-chun recording] Four years have passed since 
the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who has been interested in 
improving our people's living standards, provided a national 
light industry meeting on 2 June 1990 and sent a historic 
letter, "On Thoroughly Carrying Out the Light Industry 
Revolution," to participants of the meeting. 
  In retrospect, the dear comrade leader, who is consummating 
the chuche revolutionary cause created by the great leader 
[suryong] generation after generation, has been dedicating a lot 
of work and energy to improving our people's living standards 
day and night, without even taking a rest, since he began 
leading our party's work 30 years ago. Even after the national 
light industry meeting where he provided the occasion for an 
epochal turn in the production of people's consumer goods the 
dear comrade leader gave a great benevolence to the working 
people in developing the country's light industry and, thus, 
wisely led them to more furiously lift up the flames of the 
light industry revolution. 
  In particular, the dear comrade leader has constantly taken 
measures to smoothly guarantee raw materials and materials for 
light industry. He has seen to it that consumer goods producers 
concentrate greater efforts on further increasing the kinds, 
quantity, and quality of consumer goods. He not only has 
provided consumer goods producers with necessary funds, but has 
also established measures for supplying the raw materials to 
produce people's consumer goods. 
  Last December, the dear comrade leader specifically decided 
even the kinds of consumer goods that the light industry sector 
should produce this year. He also paid deep interest to the 
problems related to improving the quality of people's consumer 
goods and wisely led consumer goods producers to improve their 
quality. He also elucidated the direction and method in 
accelerating the modernization of light industry by rebuilding 
facilities of the existing light industry plants and their 
production process into more modernized ones and by building 
more new light industry plants equipped with up-to-date 
technology. 
  The dear comrade leader also led the production of 3 August 
people's consumer goods to be carried out more vigorously. [end 
recording] 
  Indeed, the dear comrade leader's wise leadership and 
benevolent love have provided a guideline which makes it 
possible for our light industry to devote itself to improving 
the people's living. This is why, along with our people, 
people's consumer goods producers are singing in reverence to 
him. [music] 
  The following is a questions-and-answers session between 
Comrade Kim Kwang-chu from the Light Industry Committee and a 
station reporter at Pyongyang General Textile Plant: 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] How are you? I have seen you 
many times at this plant. You are working so hard. 
  [Kim Kwang-chu] Not at all. 
  [Reporter] Four years have passed since the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il sent a programmatic letter to the 
participants of the national light industry meeting on 2 June, 
1990. Since then, not only Pyongyang General Textile Plant but 
the country's general light industry has shown considerable 
development. 
  [Kim] Yes. Under the wise leadership of the dear comrade 
leader, during the four years after the national light industry 
meeting, the material and technological basis of our light 
industry has peerlessly developed and there have been new 
achievements in the production of people's consumer goods. 
  Above all, the struggle to make light industry chuche-based 
has advanced greatly, thus providing a basis for further 
increasing the production of people's consumer goods by 
thoroughly relying on our own material and resources. In 
particular, quite a few scientific and technical problems in 
further increasing the production of quality threads and fabric 
mainly using vinalon -- the chuche textile -- were solved and 
actively applied to practice. 
  [Reporter] I understand that light industry has been further 
modernized in the flame of the light industry revolution kindled 
by the dear comrade leader. 
  [Kim] Yes. In the textile industry sector alone, spinning 
and weaving equipment now has higher speed and more precision, 
and the production process is more automatized. Pyongyang 
General Textile Plant, as well as Kaesong Textile Plant, Kangso 
Weaving Plant, Pyongyang Silk Plant, and many other plants and 
enterprises have significantly increased production capacity 
with modern equipment such as air bearing spinning machines, 
highly efficient metal weaving machines, silk looms, and 
automatic reeling machines. 
  [Reporter] I also understand that there has been 
considerable achievement in the shoe industry sector, including 
the modernization of equipment. 
  [Kim] Thanks to the benevolent love of the dear comrade 
leader, who is deeply concerned about our people's living, the 
production capacity has been increased by the newly installed 
shoe catapult machines and automatic assembly lines at Pyongyang 
Vinyl Chloride Shoe Plant, Sinuiju Shoe Plant, Sunchon Leather 
Shoe Plant, and many other plants. In recent years, the models 
and quantity have been further increased, and the quality has 
also improved remarkably. 
  [Reporter] In the flame of light industry revolution kindled 
by the dear comrade leader, our light industry is provided with 
a strong springboard for a higher leap. New achievements are 
made in succession in the production of people's consumer goods. 
We should have great pride and self-esteem about this. [end 
recording] [music] 
  Producers of consumer goods are filled with confidence and 
optimism bearing deep in their hearts the fact that there can 
only be innovations and achievements in the construction of a 
chuche-based, modern light industry base, and in the production 
of people's consumer goods when we follow the leadership of the 
dear comrade leader in practical life. [music] 
  Together with all the producers of people's consumer goods 
in the entire country, who received the letter "On Thoroughly 
Carrying Out the Light Industry Revolution" by the dear comrade 
leader to the participants of the national light industry 
meeting, functionaries, workers, and technicians of Sukchon 
Foodstuffs Plant are also increasing the production of people's 
consumer goods. 
<H5>  Engraving his intention in the heart. </H5>
  Functionaries, workers, and technicians of Sukchon 
Foodstuffs 
Plant, who have the dear comrade leader's intention engraved in 
their hearts, are actively waging the struggle to increase 
foodstuffs production by renewing the production process and 
creating more raw material bases. Comrade Yi Chang-yun, chief 
of technical preparations of the plant, said: 
  [Begin Yi Chang-yun recording] Thanks to the love and care 
of the dear comrade leader, who is always deeply concerned about 
improving our people's living, during the past four years, our 
Sukchon Foodstuffs Plant has also shown a significant increase 
in production capacity as well as quantity. What we are 
particularly proud of is that, as the dear comrade leader has 
taught in his letter, we further inflamed the light industry 
revolution by expanding the internal raw material bases to tens 
of chongbo [one chongbo equals 10,000 square meters], adding 
children's foodstuffs production lines and normalizing the 
production, and by modifying various production lines, including 
the cookie lines, in a modern way. 
  Compared with the past, the production volume of foodstuffs 
increased almost twofold. We will more vigorously wage the 
light industry revolution presented by the dear comrade leader 
so as to further modernize production lines and actively 
increase various foodstuffs production. 
  In particular, we will further display the spirit of 
self-reliance and fortitude to improve the children's foodstuffs 
production lines with our own strength and wisdom and thereby 
enhance the quality and quantity of the production of highly 
nutritious children's foodstuffs, including soybean milk, 
soybean milk power, and rice powder, for supply to more 
children. [end recording] 
  It is not easy to normalize production in a relatively small 
plant and in the meantime to add new production lines with their 
own strength and wisdom, and increase the raw material bases. 
However, functionaries, workers, and technicians of Sukchon 
Foodstuffs Plant are steadily working with all their wisdom and 
zeal bearing deep in their minds that vigorously waging the 
light industry revolution is an honorable and rewarding work 
which contributes to improving the people's living while loyally 
upholding the leadership of the dear comrade leader. 
  In a short period, the plant renewed the children's 
foodstuffs production lines, meat processing lines, and cookie 
production lines, and formed more raw material bases to actively 
increase the production of various foodstuffs. 
  Producers of consumer goods in Sukchon Foodstuffs Plant are 
vigorously inflaming the light industry revolution to better 
implement the task presented in the letter sent by the dear 
comrade leader. 
  In the future, too, these functionaries, workers, and 
technicians of the light industry sector in the entire country, 
who are displaying the honor of the producers of consumer goods, 
on the road of loyally upholding the leadership of the dear 
comrade leader, will vigorously run along the single road of 
innovation while highly upholding the flame of the light 
industry revolution.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- The May targets were 
topped by many units of the national economy of Korea. 
  The Anju, Sunchon, Tokchon and Pukchang area coal complexes, 
which had waged a vigorous increased production drive from the 
beginning of the year, far surpassed the monthly plans on all 
indices by producing more coal than the daily quotas through the 
active introduction of advanced coal-cutting methods in May. 
  The Munmuri mine under the Ministry of Mining Industry hit 
the monthly goal five days earlier than the set time by keeping 
the equipment in full-capacity operation. 
  The March 17 United Hydraulic Power Plant, the Kanggye Youth 
Power Station, the Taechon United Hydraulic Power Plant and 
other hydraulic power stations fulfilled their monthly 
assignments far ahead of schedule. These days they have chalked 
up the record high in recent years in power production. 
  In May the foreign shipping plan was carried out at 103 
percent, domestic shipping plan at 106 percent and freight 
traffic turnover plan at ports at 105 percent under the Ministry 
of Marine Transport. 
  The May targets were topped also by the Namhung Youth 
Chemical Complex, the associated local industry bureau, the 
general bureau of garment industry, the foodstuff complex of 
Pyongyang, the general bureau of local industry of South Pyongan 
and South Hwanghae Provinces, the Korean cigarette group and 
many other industrial establishments.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 5 KYODO -- Amid heightened tension over 
the North Korean nuclear issue, Japan's military establishment 
is proceeding with "operation rabbit ears," keeping tabs on 
North Korean moves by mobilizing electronic spy planes and 
electronic data-gathering facilities. 
  The Defense Agency and the Self-Defense Forces, having 
failed 
last year to promptly confirm North Korea's test-firing of a 
Nodong 1 ballistic missile into the Sea of Japan, recently 
succeeded in rapidly detecting Pyongyang's firing of another 
ballistic missile. 
  One intelligence official, however, said Japan's 
capabilities 
remain quite limited when compared with satellite reconnaissance 
capabilities of the United States. 
  The main actors in the ongoing operation are some 10 
electronic data-monitoring posts spread throughout the country, 
from Japan's large, northernmost island of Hokkaido to the 
southernmost island of Kyushu. 
  The facilities have already proved themselves, such as when 
in 1983 they successfully intercepted communications between 
Soviet fighter planes that downed a Korean Air jetliner over 
Sakhalin Island in the Russian Far East. 
  Today's operations also make use of modified YS-11 and C-1 
transport aircraft and EP-3 electronic warfare data-collection 
planes, which fly daily runs over the Sea of Japan. 
  Maritime Self-Defense Force ships are also on alert status, 
officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- Washington is not 
considering military options against North Korea for its refusal 
to allow checks of its nuclear facilities and will work through 
the United Nations, a senior Foreign Ministry official said 
Monday. 
  Yutaka Kawashima, director general of the Foreign Ministry's 
Asian Affairs Bureau, was responding to concerns posed at a 
House of Representatives Budget Committee hearing that the 
United States was considering independent sanctions. 
  "The concern of the U.S. Government has been squeezed down 
to 
how to respond through the UN Security Council and there was no 
thinking about military options," Kawashima said in response to 
a question. 
  Kazuo Kitagawa, a member of coalition component Komeito, had 
asked Kawashima about remarks made by U.S. Secretary of Defense 
William Perry in a U.S. television interview that it is possible 
that independent sanctions may be imposed on North Korea by 
countries involved in the issue. 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said that Japan will provide its 
efforts through a number of routes, while noting that Tokyo is 
seeking a negotiated resolution to North Korea's refusal to open 
its nuclear activities to full international inspections. 
  Hata, speaking at the same committee sesssion, said Japan 
will cooperate with the international community "within the 
limits permitted by the constitution" if the UN should decide to 
impose sanctions on North Korea.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry has not 
yet received any instructions over possible economic sanctions 
against North Korea, a senior ministry official said Monday. 
  But the ministry already has "know-how" to follow any U.N. 
Security Council resolutions on stopping bank remittance, as it 
did toward Iraq during the Persian Gulf war in 1990, Vice 
Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a regular news meeting. 
  Saito otherwise refused to comment, saying, "things have yet 
not progressed as far as imposing economic sanctions."

  [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Japan, South Korea and the 
United States will seek sanctions against North Korea acceptable 
to China over Pyongyang's refusal of full inspection of its 
nuclear facilities, a senior Foreign Ministry official said 
Friday [3 June]. 
  "The United States feels it has been betrayed by North 
Korea," the official said. 
  Senior officials from the three countries will discuss 
slapping sanctions on North Korea in talks Friday and Saturday 
in Washington following Pyongyang's rejection of unimpeded 
inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
  Shunji Yanai, director general of the Foreign Ministry's 
Foreign Policy Bureau, will attend the meeting. 
  The Japanese Government confirmed Friday that it will 
firstly 
call on the U.N. Security Council to adopt a resolution blaming 
North Korea and if the United States proposes a resolution 
seeking economic sanctions against the North, Japan will agree 
to it, government sources said. 
  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told a session of the House 
of 
Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on Friday that without 
winning China's support the Security Council would not be able 
to exert any pressure on North Korea to accept the international 
call for inspections. 
  China is one of the five permanent Security Council members 
and if it exercises its veto power, can knock down any 
resolution. 
  A U.S. official said one main topic at the meeting will be 
Washington's request that Tokyo halt remittances to North Korea 
from pro-Pyongyang organizations and residents in Japan, which 
are believed to be a major source of Foreign Currency for the 
isolated, economically weak country. 
  If a veto by China prevents a possible U.S.-sponsored 
resolution from being adopted by the Security Council, the three 
nations are likely to impose their own sanctions against the 
North, the sources said. 
  In case the U.N. Security Council cannot reach agreement 
over 
the sanctions issue due to anticipated opposition from China, 
North Korea's traditional ally which favors a soft approach in 
the nuclear controversy, Japan would offer "maximum cooperation" 
in multilateral punitive measures, he said. 
  Japan could do its part by halting cash remittances to North 
Korea from pro-pyongyang organizations and residents in Japan 
and suspending trade with the communist country, Kakizawa said. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai reiterated Tokyo's 
concern over North Korea's defiance of the inspection demands. 
  "We are deeply concerned about this situation," Kumagai told 
a news conference. 
  "We would like to weigh what action to take in close concert 
with the countries involved, such as the United States, South 
Korea and China," he said. 
  Kumagai later said before a lower house panel, "we have no 
specific sanctions in mind. We will tenaciously try to 
persuade" North Korea to reach a negotiated settlement of the 
nuclear row. 
  On Thursday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
informed the U.N. Security Council that Pyongyang's refusal to 
let inspectors conduct an unimpeded check of discharged fuel 
rods has made it impossible to verify whether plutonium has been 
diverted in the past to manufacture atomic bombs. 
  North Korea last month started to exchange without IAEA 
supervision the 8,000 fuel rods in its 5-megawatt reactor at 
Yongbyon, sparking another Security Council statement last week 
urging compliance with the agency's inspection demands.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News 7" </F>
program] 
  [Text] The United States, Japan, and the ROK will start a 
trilateral meeting in Washington tonight, Japan time, to 
exchange views on the issue of the UN Security Council's 
economic sanctions against North Korea. In this regard, Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata, at a news conference held today at Aizu 
Wakamatsu City in Fukushima Prefecture where he is making a 
stump tour, touched on North Korea's suspected nuclear arms 
development and explained, without making a concrete reference 
to such measures as economic sanctions, the need to continue to 
carefully deal with the issue. 
  [Begin Hata recording] I hope from the bottom of my heart 
that North Korea will talk without reserve by candidly accepting 
the opinion of international society. Also, we need to do our 
best to seek understanding of North Korea. [end recording] 
  At the same time, Prime Minister Hata said that generally 
speaking, it is a matter of course for a nation to be able to 
deal with emergency situations. In this way, he generally 
admitted that the government is studying various possible 
measures Japan can take to deal with the situation. 
  On the other hand, Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], held a news conference 
today in Hachinohe City in Aomori Prefecture. On how Japan 
should deal with the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear 
arms development, he explained a negative view toward the idea 
of imposing sanctions against the DPRK by Japan, the United 
States, and the ROK. 
  [Begin Kubo recording] I think Japan, the United States, and 
South Korea must be cautious about the idea of imposing 
sanctions without any decisions by the United Nations. I think 
the SDPJ, for its part, will take a negative position on the 
idea. [end recording] 
  In making the remark, Secretary General Kubo indicated a 
negative view on the Japan-U.S.-ROK sanctions against North 
Korea. Moreover, he stated that the Japanese Government should 
do its utmost to solve the issue in an amicable way through 
dialogue. 
  With regard to the future domestic political situation, 
Secretary General Kubo stated that if a no-confidence motion in 
the Hata cabinet is approved, there will be no other option but 
for the cabinet to resign en masse. He thus reiterated the view 
that the Hata cabinet should voluntarily resign en masse after 
the fiscal 1994 national budget passes the Diet.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- The government is planning 
to send Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa to South Korea soon for 
bilateral ministerial talks, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi 
Kumagai said Monday. 
  "We are currently considering the convening of Japan-South 
Korea foreign ministerial talks," the top government spokesman 
said at a news conference. 
  But Kumagai hastened to add that the schedule has yet to be 
fixed and the planned session does not necessarily aim to 
discuss the two countries' response to North Korea's alleged 
push for nuclear arms. 
  It will be meaningful to exchange views at a high-level, he 
noted. 
  Kumagai said he will discuss the planned talks with South 
Korea when he meets with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and 
Kakizawa later Monday. 
  Hata, Kakizawa and Kumagai meet on Monday night to listen to 
a report from Shunji Yanai, director general of the Foreign 
Ministry's Foreign Policy Bureau, who represented Japan at 
trilateral talks with the United States and South Korea last 
week. 
  At that time, the three countries adopted a united front and 
urged the U.N. Security Council to take prompt action against 
North Korea, including the consideration of economic sanctions. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito told a press conference 
that Japan wants to hold the foreign ministerial meeting as 
early as possible considering the situation surrounding North 
Korea's alleged development of nuclear weapons. 
  But he said the meeting has not yet been set because of Diet 
schedules. 
  Saito said Kakizawa and South Korean Foreign Minister Han 
Sung- chu will discuss a wide range of issues since it is a 
regular foreign ministerial meeting. 
  The previous meeting was held in September when Han visited 
Japan. 
  The Foreign Ministry is also preparing to dispatch Kakizawa 
to China, which opposes sanctions against North Korea, for talks 
with his counterpart Qian Qichen next Sunday, the sources said. 
  Kakizawa is expected to urge China to exert influence on 
Pyongyang, its traditional ally, to accept full inspections of 
its nuclear facilities. However, Kakizawa's trip might have to 
be postponed in connection with developments during the ongoing 
Diet session, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- Japan will tell the 
International Court of Justice that it does not regard the use 
of nuclear weapons as a violation of international law, 
officials said Monday. 
  The ruling coalition endorsed the government's traditional 
view on the issue in an official statement to be submitted to 
the Hague- based International Court, they said. 
  The gist of the government's statement on the use of nuclear 
arms was approved by a meeting of coalition executives when it 
was presented to the meeting by the Foreign Ministry. 
  The statement is in response to the court's request that 
each 
country submit such a document by Friday. The court was asked 
in May by the World Health Organization (WHO) to decide whether 
or not staging a nuclear warfare violates international law. 
  WHO, inspired by growing concerns about the adverse effect 
any use of nuclear arms would have on people's health, sought 
the court's ruling on the issue. 
  In the statement, the government will also elucidate Japan's 
basic stance on nuclear arms as symbolized by the so-called 
three nonnuclear principles. 
  Japan has been holding strict antinuclear principles -- not 
making, possessing or introducing nuclear weapons to Japan -- as 
a national tenet since they were approved by the Diet in 1968. 
  Nagasaki, which suffered atomic bombing in 1945 after 
Hiroshima, has raised objection to the government's standing on 
the issue. 
  It presented a written request to Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata 
and Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, calling on the government to 
denounce the use of nuclear arms as violation of international 
law. 
  Nagasaki argues in the document that the indiscriminate 
killing of people with atomic bombs clearly constitutes a 
violation of international law from a humanistic standpoint. 
  The city criticized the government for not fully 
acknowledging the devastating conditions in the A-bombed areas 
or the agony of the victims.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 4 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
reported progress in restarted talks on telecommunications trade 
Saturday but said they avoided the two thorniest issues. 
  "Considerable movement was made in narrowing differences in 
qualitative criteria," the U.S. side said in a statement. 
  But both sides said they avoided discussing quantitative 
criteria, which earlier led to wrangling over "numerical 
targets" for market share in other sectors and scuttled 
bilateral trade "framework" talks in February. 
  Negotiators also skirted the sticking point of whether 
Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) should be covered by the 
talks on government procurement of telecom and medical 
equipment, Japanese and U.S. officials said. 
  Both sides agreed to continue working-level talks in 
midmonth, probably in Washington. "Things are moving, so that's 
good," a U.S. Official said. 
  The Japanese side explained promises it made in a March 
market- opening package to make its procurement practices 
clearer and fairer. 
  A Japanese Foreign Ministry official said the U.S. side 
seemed to "evaluate quite highly" the explanation, while the 
U.S. statement said the "plan addressed a number of key issues." 
  "But we indicated some major areas where the plan fell short 
of eliminating our concerns," the U.S. said. The U.S. 
official said he could not comment further. 
  The Japanese official described the talks as 
"forward-looking 
and constructive," giving the impression that "things are moving 
in a better direction." The U.S. said they were "cordial and 
conducted in a positive atmosphere." 
  The talks will proceed, the Japanese official said, on the 
basis of Japan's market-opening package, which includes widening 
the scope of products subject to agreement, making 
specifications fairer and simpler, making information available 
on government tenders, improving the review of bidding 
complaints and instituting comprehensive bid evaluations. 
  Washington vowed last month in an agreement restarting the 
talks that it is not seeking targets, and the U.S. made no 
proposals that contradicted that assurance in the Tokyo talks, 
the Japanese official said. 
  On NTT, Tokyo insists the telecom giant is a private company 
that cannot be held to government procurement promises, while 
the U.S. says the Japanese Government's two-thirds ownership of 
publicly traded NTT makes it a government entity.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry is to 
partially lift the ban on off-exchange forward contract dealings 
on interest and currency rates by banks as early as July, 
ministry officials said Monday. 
  The ministry plans to include the deregulatory steps in 
Japan's second market-opening package to be launched in late 
June in line with strong international demands, especially from 
the United States, to allow the hedging tools commonly used 
overseas, said the officials, who requested anonymity. 
  Japan promised in a first package adopted in March to offer 
detailed deregulatory measures on financial services in June. 
  The hedging tool on interest rates, called a forward rate 
agreement (FRA), involves a contract agreed upon by negotiation 
between two parties -- either between banks or between banks and 
customers -- on the interest rate to be paid at future 
settlement. 
  With the principal amount agreed on but never exchanged, FRA 
contracts are settled in cash, with risk limited to the gap 
between the contracted and actual rates at settlement. 
  The same dealings used for currency rates are called forward 
exchange agreements. 
  Unlike futures contracts traded on exchanges, the forward 
agreements are made under negotiations by two parties, and the 
Ministry of Justice has strongly opposed the dealing's gambling 
nature. 
  But citing the FRA's increasing role in the U.S. and Europe 
to hedge interest rate fluctuations, the Finance Ministry 
decided to lift the ban with certain limits in a bid to secure 
Japan's position in the international financial market, the 
officials said. 
  Banking industry officials said the industry has not yet 
received any notice from the ministry, but noted that the 
negotiated transactions will allow banks to meet needs by 
individual customers through free setting of contract amounts 
and starting and settlement dates. 
  In this sense, they said, futures contracts are fixed, with 
yen- based interest rates, for example, traded on the Tokyo 
international financial futures exchange under three-month and 
one-year contracts on euroyen deposit rates. 
  FRA also helps banks maintain the capital adequacy ratio 
required by the Swiss-based Bank for International Settlements 
because dealings are made off the book without changing their 
assets and liabilities.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam 
issued a "special alert order" and an "emergency alert order" to 
the entire puppet Armed Forces and police throughout South Korea 
for the period from May 31 to June 7, raising outcries over the 
"military moves of the North" surrounding his foreign tour. 
Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today brands this as a 
premeditated provocation intended to aggravate tensions while 
slandering the North and drive the situation to the brink of war. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The danger of war on the Korean peninsula comes from the 
South, not from the North. 
  The puppets have worked out and published a war scenario 
codenamed new operation plan 5027 and are continuously shipping 
in new-type weapons and equipment including Patriot missiles and 
Apache attack helicopters and staging nuclear war exercises 
against the North every day in conspiracy with outside forces. 
  Yet the Kim Yong-sam group is making a fuss over "threat 
from 
the North". This is a shameless act reminding us of a thief 
crying "stop thief." Such act can be done only by those who have 
been driven into a hopeless crisis, forsaken by the people. 
  Their clamour is motivated by a criminal intention to divert 
elsewhere the people's resentment against them and bridge over 
the crisis of the fascist rule by aggravating confrontation and 
tensions.

  The United States these days is orchestrating an anti-DPRK 
pressure campaign over the core refueling operation at its 
experimental atomic power plant, crying for "UN sanctions," 
"multinational sanctions" and "preemptive strike" at its 
peaceful nuclear facilities. 
  This indicates that the United States is opting the strong 
arm, throwing away even the veil of DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  In this connection we declared that our nuclear activities 
will go over to the next process and we will have no alternative 
but to expand our independent nuclear power industry by the 
present method and that, in case the United States says the 
foundation of its talks with the DPRK has been destroyed, the 
foundation of the temporary suspension of the effectuation of 
our declared withdrawal from the [Nuclear] Non-Proliferation 
Treaty will also collapse. 
  When things take this course, neither the United States nor 
the International Atomic Energy Agency can blame us. Because 
such situation has been caused by them. 
  The United States is not interested in the solution of the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula but seeks only to stifle 
our socialist system. 
  Our core refueling operation is taking place on condition 
that the non-divergence of nuclear fuel to the military purpose 
is firmly guaranteed and technical possibility is preserved for 
an ad hoc inspection of the fuel rods when the unique status of 
the DPRK is removed. 
  The campaign to stifle the DPRK over its core refueling 
cannot be justified in any respect. 
  Since some quarters of the Secretariat of the agency 
"concluded" that the possibility of later measurement of fuel 
rods is lost, we do not intend to beg for measurement, if the 
Secretariat refuses it. 
  The United States must stop acting rashly, pondering over 
the 
grave consequences to be entailed by its policy of stifling the 
DPRK. 
  If "sanctions" are taken against us, not only the parties 
participating in them but also those backing them will have to 
bear responsibility.

<F P=106> [Statement by the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification </F>
of the Fatherland issued in Pyongyang on 6 June -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the 
Fatherland [CPRF] issued the following statement in connection 
with the fact that the situation on the Korean peninsula faces 
the worst situation because the South Korean puppet clique is 
committing vicious maneuvers of sanctions against us, by 
conspiring with the United States. 
  Statement by the CPRF: 
  Today, the situation on the Korean peninsula is on the verge 
of entering into the worst situation. The nuclear commotion 
being carried out by the United States and its following forces 
is trying to openly move it toward sanctions against us, and the 
endless threat and suppression continued by them is making the 
situation enter into the doors of war. 
  What cannot be overlooked is that the South Korean ruling 
bunch, who are indiscriminately conspiring with the outside 
forces at a time when the nation is at the crossroad of life and 
death, are carrying out rash and thoughtless acts and are making 
the situation on the Korean peninsula a very acute one. 
  We warned the South Korean authorities not only once or 
twice 
of what sanctions mean, which the imperialists are trying to 
force us into by finding fault with the nonexistent nuclear 
issue, and what danger it represents if we are involved in the 
sanctions. Nevertheless, the South Korean ruling bunch are 
standing at the forefront, more so than the outside forces, and 
are running amok by blowing the trumpet of sanctions against the 
fellow countrymen. 
  The South Korean puppet clique that ignored the North-South 
dialogue and that clung to the so-called international 
cooperative system, recently all the more persistently begged 
for sanctions against the North before the masters in the United 
Nations, Washington, and Tokyo, and is crazily babbling the 
inevitability of sanctions in the empty sky whenever it opens 
its mouth. 
  The South Korean ruling bunch is conspiring with the master 
for UN sanctions and multinational sanctions, and is even 
hurriedly putting forth its groundless antinational method of 
sanctions against the North. At the same time, it ordered the 
whole area of South Korea to be on alert and is unhesitatingly 
making provocative absurd remarks against us. 
  Looking at all the facts, it is clear that the South Korean 
ruling bunch is throwing itself into becoming the shock brigade 
of the anti-Republic maneuver and a servant of war for the 
master with enthusiasm. 
  Begging for sanctions toward the fellow countrymen to the 
outside forces means that it attaches greater importance to the 
allies than the nation. Bringing about a very dangerous 
situation of war which was not even carried out during the 
military fascist dictatorial regime before, can by no means be 
regarded as a civilian-ruled regime. 
  It was all the more clearly revealed that the South Korean 
ruling bunch is a group of nation sellers entrusting the 
nation's fate to the outside forces through its acts, and a 
civilian-ruled fascist group pursuing war by wearing the mask of 
a civilian-ruled regime. 
  We cannot but worry about the national misfortune and 
calamity which can be committed anytime by the crazy rascals 
running amok in accordance with the interest of the outside 
forces. This is not an issue limited to the North or the South, 
and also it is not an issue regarding the one side's ideology 
and system. This is an issue of the life and death of 70 
million people transcending differences in region, ideology, and 
system of the North and South. 
  If the nation's interest is put in the forefront and regards 
the nation's existence as the source, no one can gamble with 
this important issue, and must not make a foolish thought of 
trying to gain interest through this gamble. 
  Sanctions mean war, and there is no mercy in war. There is 
no greater miscalculation to think that they will be safe if 
they carry out sanctions toward the fellow countrymen by 
conspiring with outside forces. 
  With the least expectation, if Kim Yong-sam dares to move 
toward the road of adventure, this will mean his end. The Kim 
Yong-sam puppet clique must correctly know that the United 
States, its master, and the Patriot missiles, which it dragged 
in, cannot protect him, and act with discretion. 
  [Dated] 6 June 1994, Pyongyang

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 5 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists on 
June 3 staged a provocative bombing exercise against the North 
in the sky above South Korea by mobilizing 20 odd Pacific-based 
pursuit-assault planes and VTOL [vertical takeoff and landing] 
assault planes and various types of fighter-bombers, assault 
planes, observation planes and reconnaissance planes belonging 
to the U.S. Airforce present in South Korea and the puppet 
Airforce, according to military sources. 
  On the same day, a tank group of the puppet Army deployed in 
the area of Paju County and large-calibre artillery groups of 
the puppet Army which took positions in Paju County and Chorwon 
County, South Korean Kangwon Province, fired some 20 tank 
shells and 120 artillery shells into the area near the 
demilitarized zone, and armed bandits of the puppet Army in the 
area fired more than 1,000 large-calibre machinegun and 
automatic rifle bullets, kicking up war fever. 
  And, "commandoes" dropped on the area of Paju County incited 
a war atmosphere by making a surprise attack on the targets in 
their operational plan. 
  Such war exercises of the U.S. imperialists and the South 
Korean puppets gravely threaten the peace and security of the 
Korean peninsula.

<F P=106> ["Dangerous Military Move" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- The United States and 
the South Korean puppet clique reportedly announced on June 1 
that they would stage Ulchi Focus Lens with far larger forces 
than last year for two weeks from August 22 this year. 
  The announcement came at a time when the wicked forces are 
kicking up a hysterical clamour for pressure and "sanctions" 
against the DPRK following the "presidential statement" of the 
U.N. Security Council a few days ago, which contained an 
unreasonable argument against the DPRK. This is an open 
challenge to the DPRK and a very ill-boding military move to 
drive the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war. 
This arouses our due vigilance. 
  The U.S. hardline conservatives including Defense Secretary 
William Perry have openly called for "policy of physical 
strength." The traitor Kim Yong-sam "inspected" the combat 
preparedness of puppet Army units, inciting a war fever. The 
Rimpac joint military maneuvers simulating a military attack on 
the DPRK are being staged. These facts show that the military 
move of the United States and the South Korean puppet clique to 
carry into practice new operation plan 5027 for a war against 
the North is entering into a very grave stage. 
  The United States and the South Korean puppet clique must 
refrain from rash acts, clearly mindful of the grave 
consequences that may arise from their adventurous military 
action.

<F P=106> ["Grave Threat to Peace on Korean Peninsula" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 5 (KCNA) -- The United States and 
the South Korean puppets announced that they would stage Ulchi 
Focus Lens joint military exercises in South Korea for two weeks 
from August 22 allegedly to fill the "gap" till the start of the 
"Team Spirit" war game. 
  The new large-scale nuclear war drill projected by the 
United 
States and the South Korean puppets is a grave challenge to the 
whole nation which desire peace on the Korean peninsula and its 
peaceful reunification, and it is a dangerous action to carry 
the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war, 
declares NODONG SINMUN in a commentary today. 
  The analyst says: 
  The open announcement of the plan of a provocative war 
gamble 
against the North by the South Korean puppets together with 
outside forces clearly indicates that they do not want a 
solution to the peace problem on the Korean peninsula through 
dialogue and negotiation but seek to attain their aim of 
aggression with "strength". 
  The talk about "gap" is a poor excuse invented by them to 
justify the adventurous war racket against the North. 
  With nothing can the United States and the Kim Yong-sam 
group 
justify the Ulchi Focus Lens joint military exercises which 
would gravely threaten our nation and endanger peace in Asia and 
the rest of the world. 
  Our people who love peace do not want war but are never 
afraid of it and can never tolerate the aggressors provoking us. 
  The United States and the South Korean puppets must cancel 
the plan of an adventurous war gamble, pondering over the 
consequences to be entailed by their provocative play with fire.

  The agricultural working people have made a breakthrough for 
reaping another rich crop this year by finishing rice

  Weeding has already entered a full-scale stage in Paechon, 
Chaeryong and Anak, South Hwanghae Province, and in Unjon, 
Chongju and Yomju, North Pyongan Province, and many other areas

  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
stressed that a special inspection of two undeclared nuclear 
facilities is indispensable [pilsujok] to examine North Korea's 
diversion of nuclear material, and called for full-scale 
cooperation from North Korea. 
  Correspondent Cha Man-sun reports from Vienna: 
  [Begin Cha recording] Reporting on the status of the 
replacement of fuel rods to its Board of Governors during its 
informal meeting held yesterday [3 June] afternoon, the IAEA 
pointed out that the decisive opportunity [kyolchongjogin kihoe] 
to examine North Korea's diversion of nuclear material has 
already been lost. 
  The IAEA reported to its 35 Board of Governors member states 
that providing additional information, which has been demanded 
from early last year, and a special inspection of two undeclared 
facilities are indispensable for determining the exact amount of 
plutonium produced in North Korea. Thus, full-scale cooperation 
from North Korea is urgent. 
  At yesterday's Board of Governors meeting, Olli Heinonen, 
head of the inspection section who inspected the replacement of 
fuel rods in Yongbyon, stressed that because nearly all of the 
fuel rods were replaced in the portion where sample-taking is 
definitely required, the result of analysis cannot be trusted 
even if samples are taken. 
  Councilor Yun Ho-chin from the North Korean side and Kim 
Su-kil, researcher in the DPRK Foreign Ministry, who came from 
Pyongyang, attended the informal Board of Governors meeting 
yesterday. They repeatedly referred to North Korea's special 
position of withholding the withdrawal of Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, and persistently refused interviews by 
reporters. [end recording]

<F P=106> [AFP, YONHAP From Vienna] </F>
  [Text] According to diplomats in Vienna, the Board of 
Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] has 
convened a special meeting to discuss a draft declaration urging 
North Korea to accept all inspections in relation to nuclear 
weapons development. 
  The diplomats said that the meeting, which was held a day 
before the official Board of Governors meeting scheduled for 5 
June, reviewed a draft declaration denouncing North Korea for 
violating the inspections provisions of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] by removing fuel rods from the 
five-megawatt experimental reactor without IAEA supervision. 
  They said that the declaration urges North Korea to fulfill 
the obligations of the NPT and that the declaration will be 
announced as an official result of the Board of Governors 
meeting or a president's statement. 
  The IAEA Board of Governors is expected to discuss the North 
Korean issue on 9 or 10 June when the UN Security Council makes 
a decision on sanctions against North Korea.

  [Text] The ROK and the United States agreed to take gradual 
[tangyejogin] steps for sanctions against North Korea, which in 
the end refused the request of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA]. 
  Correspondent Kim In-kyu reports from Washington: 
  [Begin Kim recording] Today at the U.S. State Department, 
Kim 
Sam-hun, ROK nuclear ambassador; and Robert Gallucci, U.S. 
assistant secretary of state, discussed appropriate 
countermeasures [taehung chochi] against the North Korean act of 
violating the Nuclear Safeguards Accord. They shared the view 
that they should take gradual sanctions against North Korea at 
the earliest possible date. 
  Following the talks between the ROK and the United States, 
Assistant Secretary Gallucci held a special briefing at the 
State Department and revealed that there was no difference in 
views whatsoever between the two countries on steps to be taken 
next, including sanctions against North Korea. 
  In particular, answering the question on a possibility of 
the 
beginning of actual sanctions against North Korea within this 
month, Assistant Secretary Gallucci said that for this issue, 
close consultations will be held with allied nations and with 
Standing Committee members of the UN Security Council between 
this weekend and next week. Thus, he made it clear that they 
will strongly push for sanctions this month. 
  Nuclear Ambassador Kim Sam-hun revealed that since the 
foundation for continuing dialogue with North Korea collapsed, 
steps for sanctions against North Korea were discussed with the 
United States and the UN Security Council. As a result, they 
unanimously expressed the position that a resolution for 
practical sanctions must be adopted before it is too late in a 
bid to not lose the momentum favorable to sanctions against 
North Korea. 
  Ambassador Kim Sam-hun and Assistant Secretary Gallucci 
pointed out that although a method of analyzing fuel rods among 
the three possible methods to determine the amount of plutonium 
North Korea has extracted up to now has vanished, another 
method, including a special inspection of a radiochemical waste 
dumping site, still remained. Thus, they suggested that there is 
room for dialogue if North Korea allows the special inspection.

  [Text] The Japanese Government has worked out concrete 
steps to be taken as means of sanctions against North Korea, and 
decided to actively cooperate with the United States even if it 
independently takes steps for sanctions in the event the UN 
Security Council fails to adopt a resolution on sanctions 
against North Korea. 
  Correspondent Yi Il-hwa reports from Tokyo: 
  [Begin Yi recording] The Japanese Government decided on 
steps 
it could take if sanctions are imposed on North Korea regarding 
the nuclear problem. 
  The steps for sanctions worked out by the Japanese 
Government 
essentially include 10 points. These points include 
restrictions on the exchange of people, such as banning 
diplomats' contacts, and restriction on money and materials. 
  The restrictions on the exchange of people stipulate that 
Japanese diplomats would be prohibited from contacting North 
Korean diplomats in a third country, the visit of Japanese 
Government officials to North Korea would be in principle 
banned, and government officials would not be permitted to use a 
special airplane flying between Tokyo and North Korea. 
  The restrictions on money and materials stipulate the 
banning 
of intermediate export-import trade, suspension of transactions 
in capitals, including investment and loans, and the 
discontinuation of remittance of money to North Korea through 
the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan 
[Chongnyon], a demand of the United States. 
  These restrictions also contain the banning of exchanges of 
culture, art, and science, including music, sports, and 
technology. 
  In addition to these steps finalized by the Japanese 
Government, Japan decided to actively cooperate the United 
States in collaboration with the ROK, even if the United States 
independently takes steps on sanctions in the event the UN 
Security Council fails to adopt a resolution. 
  In the event that U.S. forces launch naval blockade 
activities, Japan will see to it that the Japanese Self-Defense 
Forces can participate in the logistic support, including the 
supply of materials and fuel. [end recording]

  [Text] Washington, June 3 (YONHAP) -- South Korea, the 
United States and Japan held a series of contacts here Friday 
and discussed details of their plans for a U.N. Security Council 
resolution imposing economic sanctions on North Korea. 
  The U.S. ambassador in charge of the North Korean nuclear 
affair, Robert Gallucci, met separately with his South Korean 
counterpart Kim Sam-hun and the Japanese Foreign Ministry's 
director-general of the Diplomatic Policy Bureau, Shunji Yanai. 
  They are scheduled to hold a tripartite meeting Saturday 
morning to coordinate their positions on possible U.N. sanctions 
against Pyongyang. 
  Following his meeting with Gallucci, Kim said that since the 
chance of measuring nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor 
has been lost, it is even more important for the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to conduct special inspections of 
nuclear waste facilities at Yongbyon. "There is no need to 
abandon dialogue with North Korea if suspicions over North 
Korea's nuclear intentions could be dispelled through (the 
IAEA's) special inspections," Kim said. Kim thus indicated that 
the international community plans to apply economic pressure on 
North Korea while demanding that it permit special inspections. 
  Asked about the possibility of resuming dialogue with North 
Korea, Kim said that at this juncture it is important to propose 
and adopt a Security Council resolution on economic sanctions. 
But the Security Council's main aim is to resolve the dispute 
over Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons program, Kim said. 
"Therefore, dialogue with North Korea can be resumed depending 
on North Korea's attitude and if there is a possibility that the 
fundamental problems can be solved." 
  South Korea, the United States and Japan are pushing a 
Security Council resolution on economic sanctions that could 
have a practical impact, Kim said. Kim hinted that the three 
countries would press for the resolution at the earliest 
possible date, grabbing the opportunity as IAEA Director-general 
Hans Blix is scheduled to explain the agency's inspection 
results to the council Friday afternoon. 
  The Korean ambassador said he understood that U.S. and South 
Korean military officials are conducting close coordination in 
preparation for a possible rise in tension on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Meanwhile, Gallucci held a special press briefing Friday and 
explained that the United States has already begun consultations 
with its allies on appropriate action against North Korea. 
  "Thus far, with our brief initial meeting, I detect no 
differences between us and our South Korean allies," Gallucci 
said. He stressed that international sanctions against North 
Korea would not destroy the basis for resolving the issue. 
Gallucci said there were three ways to determine what happened 
in 1989 at the 5-megawatt reactor: 
  -- by additional information provided by North Korea. 
  -- by special inspection of the radioactive waste sites' 
operating history through non-destructive analysis of fuel 
discharged from the reactor. 
  -- by reconstruction of the reactor operating history 
through 
nondestructive analysis of fuel discharged from the reactor. 
  Blix has said that the third way has been irrevocably 
destroyed as a methodology for the IAEA and therefore the 
overall ability to ascertain what happened in the past has been 
seriously eroded, he said. But Gallucci was quick to add that 
"that does not mean (they are) destroyed." 
  The IAEA, with the full cooperation of North Korea, could 
still get at it, he said. In effect, Gallucci hinted that there 
was room to resume negotiations, depending on the North Koreans' 
attitude. 
  Asked about the purpose of economic sanctions, Gallucci 
said: 
"We are looking for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, we are 
looking for full NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] adherence 
(by North Korea), we are looking for full-scope safeguards, the 
acceptance of special inspections and the implementation of the 
North-South declaration on denuclearization."

<F P=106> [By correspondent Hong Song-kyu from London] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu has said that a 
resolution regarding sanctions on North Korea will be included 
in the agenda of the UN Security Council's discussion on the 
North Korean nuclear issue, which is scheduled to begin this 
week. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who stopped over in London on 
4 June on his way to New York to attend the UN Security Council 
meeting, and U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, who was 
accompanying U.S. President Clinton on his visit to the UK, had 
a telephone conversation for about an hour to discuss sanctions 
on North Korea. 
  Minister Han said the U.S., UK, and ROK foreign ministers 
agreed that it is time for the UN Security Council to impose 
strong sanctions on North Korea and that special inspections 
[tukpyol sachal] are necessary because North Korea already 
passed the limit demanded by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency. 
  Minister Han said he expected Russia and the PRC would 
cooperate if the resolution concerning sanctions on North Korea 
was included in the UN Security Council agenda.

  [Text] It was learned that Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae 
and U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry used a hotline for 
about 30 minutes on the morning of 4 June to discuss 
preparations to strengthen ROK-U.S. joint military rapport in 
connection with the tense situation surrounding the Korean 
peninsula due to the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  A high-ranking Defense Ministry official revealed: "It is 
known that they discussed the issue from various angles on ways 
to make preparations to strengthen the military rapport between 
the two countries for possible provocations by North Korea if 
economic sanctions are imposed." This is the first time that 
the two ministers talked over the hotline, with the exception of 
the test conducted when it was installed last month.

  [Text] New York, June 6 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu flew to New York Sunday to lobby for a 
sanctions resolution on North Korea by the United Nations 
Security Council. 
  Upon his arrival, Han was briefed by Kim Sam-hun, Seoul's 
ambassador in charge of nuclear affairs, on the results of 
three-way talks on Saturday among South Korea, the United States 
and Japan on the imposition of sanctions against Pyongyang. 
  Han will hold separate meetings with Security Council 
President Salim Bin Mohammed al-Khussaiby and the U.N. 
ambassadors of the five permanent council members to convey the 
South Korean Government position that sanctions are inevitable 
at this stage and to persuade them to endorse a sanctions 
resolution, sources here said. 
  The South Korean foreign minister will also meet with Robert 
Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of state for political and 
military affairs, Monday afternoon when Gallucci comes to New 
York to speak at the Asia Society, they said. Han and Gallucci 
will discuss their governments' positions on sanctions and 
coordinate their future strategy in pushing ahead with sanctions 
at the Security Council. 
  The council is likely to take up the sanctions issue early 
this week on the basis of a proposal made by South Korea, the 
United States and Japan. The proposal will be made into a draft 
resolution after consultations with the four other standing 
council members -- Britain, China, Russia and France -- before 
finally being presented at a Security Council meeting. 
  Seoul, Washington and Tokyo have already reached complete 
agreement on the timing and intensity of sanctions, according to 
the sources, who expect a draft resolution to be completed by 
early this week. 
  Minister Han, who stopped off in London on Saturday on his 
way to New York, had telephone talks with U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher and his British counterpart Douglas 
Hurd on cooperating at the Security Council on the North Korean 
nuclear issue. Han also briefed Christopher and Hurd, who were 
having bilateral talks in London, on the results of President 
Kim Yong-sam's visit to Russia. 
  Han separated from the presidential entourage just before 
its 
departure from Moscow to Uzbekistan on President Kim's 
instruction to fly to go to New York for talks with U.N. 
officials prior to U.N. Security Council's discussion of 
sanctions to be imposed on North Korea.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Chong Chin-sok from Washington: </F>
"Why Is the Presentation of a Sanction Bill on the North Korean 
Nuclear Issue to the UN Security Council Being Delayed?"] 
  [Text] Diplomatic negotiations over the adoption of a UN 
Security Council resolution on sanctions against North Korea 
have been undergoing some trouble. 
  The United States at first planned to have a discussion on a 
resolution which the ROK, Japan, and the United States had 
drafted at a session of the five permanent members early this 
week to pass it as soon as possible. However, the countries 
reportedly are having difficulties in reaching accord among 
themselves. As a result, it will take some time to present a 
draft resolution on sanctions against North Korea to the UN 
Security Council. 
  The United States, which had been playing a leading role in 
passing a resolution, had a tripartite consultation with the ROK 
and Japan in Washington and New York and coordinated views among 
the five permanent members of the Security Council toward the 
end of last week. However, the United States seems to be 
embarrassed because it realized the difficulty in passing a 
resolution. In short, countries concerned do not positively 
support the United States' ideas on the timing and method of the 
sanctions. 
  The attitudes of China and Russia may be understandable to 
the United States. However, Japan, a major country concerned, 
expressed the view that it cannot accept the United States' plan 
on sanctions. The two countries have reached agreement on 
sanctions in principle. However, they have significantly 
different views on details of the sanction plan, including how 
to impose sanctions. 
  The consultation among the ROK, the United States, and Japan 
which took place in Washington on 3 and 4 June (Washington time) 
is the proof of the difficulties in passing a resolution. That 
day's meeting was intended to draft a resolution. They agreed 
on a general idea on sanctions for two days of separate and 
expanded meetings. However, they reportedly failed to reach 
agreement on what should be included in the sanctions. 
  For example, no agreement was reached as to whether 
sanctions 
will be imposed immediately after a resolution is passed or 
whether a certain grace period will be given to North Korea to 
see North Korea's reaction to the sanctions. Still, the three 
countries appeared to have agreed that the effectuation of 
sanctions must not be delayed for very long. 
  The problem was how to impose sanctions. Kim Sam-hun, the 
ROK nuclear ambassador, and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State 
Gallucci reportedly had no different views. However, (Sunji 
Yanai), chief of a bureau of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, 
expressed his opposition in many respects. Japan said that it 
"would cooperate on matters in which it can under the 
constitution." It also said that it is not necessary to hastily 
present a draft resolution. 
  It is expected that the passage of a resolution will be 
delayed not only because it is difficult to draft a resolution, 
but because countries concerned still want to try to resolve the 
nuclear issue through dialogue. The United States and other 
Western countries want to leave the door open for North Korea's 
acceptance of special inspections of the two unreported 
facilities in Yongbyon, the final exit.

<F P=106> [Report by Chin Chang-uk on interview with Kim Sam-hun, ROK </F>
nuclear ambassador, by Washington-based ROK correspondents in 
Washington D.C. on 3 June] 
  [Text] Kim Sam-hun, ROK nuclear ambassador, said on 3 June 
that UN Security Council sanctions against North Korea are aimed 
at resolving the North Korean nuclear problem and if North Korea 
ensures nuclear transparency in the future, sanctions can be 
removed. 
  In an interview with Washington-based ROK correspondents 
held 
in Washington, Ambassador Kim pointed out that adoption of a 
resolution on sanctions against North Korea by the UN Security 
Council is the most important issue at present. He stressed, 
however, that if North Korea allows a special inspection of two 
undeclared nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA], it would be a breakthrough in the North Korean 
nuclear problem, although the issue on fuel rods in the Yongbyon 
reactor has not been resolved satisfactorily. 
  The interview follows: 
  [Question] What is the purpose of your visit to Washington? 
  [Kim Sam-hun] My purpose is to discuss the positions on the 
North Korean nuclear issue by the ROK and the United States in 
the UN Security Council, as well as that between the ROK, the 
United States, and Japan; and to discuss sanctions against North 
Korea by the UN Security Council with its Standing Committee 
member states. 
  I had consultations on measures of the ROK and the United 
States with Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of state 
and coordinator of the North Korean nuclear issue, on the 
morning of 3 June. On 4 June, I will have working-level 
consultations with the United States and Japan. 
  [Question] What was the content of discussion with Assistant 
Secretary Gallucci? 
  [Kim Sam-hun] We discussed various steps and a broad range 
of issues regarding sanctions by the UN Security Council against 
North Korea. There was no difference in views between the ROK 
and the United States during the discussion. 
  [Question] What is the purpose of sanctions against North 
Korea? 
  [Kim Sam-hun] The sanctions are aimed at removing nuclear 
suspicion of North Korea and ensuring nuclear transparency. The 
purpose is to ultimately resolve the North Korean nuclear 
problem. 
  The ROK Government made efforts to resolve the problem 
through dialogue to the end. However, the IAEA decided that its 
future measurement of used nuclear fuel rods in the Yongbyon 
reactor is now impossible. As a result, the basis for dialogue 
has collapsed and sanctions have become inevitable. 
  Even if sanctions are imposed, we will not renounce dialogue 
with North Korea if nuclear suspicion is removed and nuclear 
transparency is ensured. 
  [Question] Is there any other way to examine North Korea's 
diversion of nuclear material, other than by the fuel rods in 
the five-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon? 
  [Kim Sam-hun] Even without the fuel rods in the Yongbyon 
reactor, there is room for examining the history of North Korean 
nuclear development provided that an inspection is allowed of 
the two undeclared nuclear facilities that North Korea omitted 
from the list when it reported its 16 nuclear facilities to the 
IAEA. Therefore, the inspection of two undeclared facilities, 
which are known to store nuclear waste after reprocessing, will 
become an important issue in the future. 
  Since the accuracy of measurement of used fuel rods from the 
reactor is higher than any other method, the IAEA demanded this 
measurement from North Korea. 
  North Korea has persistently refused the IAEA's special 
inspection of its two undeclared facilities since March 1993. 
Because of this, the North Korean nuclear issue has reached the 
sanctions stage. 
  [Question] What is the extent of the U.S. and ROK attitude 
regarding sanctions against North Korea? 
  [Kim Sam-hun] IAEA Secretary-General Hans Blix's report to 
the UN Security Council is an important momentum for sanctions 
against North Korea. We must not lose this momentum. It is not 
desirable to miss the opportunity by wasting time. The issue of 
sanctions is still in the discussion stage. However, if 
sanctions against North Korea are approved by the UN Security 
Council, they should contain practical consequences. The 
sanctions this time should not merely be a statement-like 
warning, as the recent presidential statement of UN Security 
Council. 
  [Question] Is there any change in China's attitude, which is 
a Standing Committee member state of the Security Council? 
  [Kim Sam-hun] I cannot say at this moment that there is a 
change. I may point out, however, that the ROK and the United 
States has made all possible efforts to include China in the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, and has tried to 
create conditions for China to do so. 
  [Question] What if North Korea declares its withdrawal from 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] before the UN Security 
Council puts sanctions to a vote, and what would be your 
reaction if North Korea declares that it possesses nuclear 
armament? 
  [Kim Sam-hun] The North Korean nuclear problem began in 
1992, and has been a full-scale international issue since March 
1993. The international community will never tolerate North 
Korea's declaring its withdrawal from the NPT or that it is a 
nuclear-state. As the North Korean nuclear problem has been 
discussed by the UN Security Council on many occasions, there 
will be no problem in imposing sanctions even if North Korea 
carries out such an act.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yu Chong-ha, ROK permanent representative to </F>
the United Nations, by Kim Cha-ung at the UN Headquarters in New 
York on 3 June -- first two paragraphs are TONG-A ILBO 
introduction] 
  [Text] Permanent Representative Yu Chong-ha revealed on the 
afternoon of 3 June: "Currently, the ROK Government's firm 
position is that it is inevitable to implement sanctions against 
North Korea through the UN Security Council [UNSC]." He also 
said: "During the meeting among the ROK, the United States, and 
Japan scheduled for 3, 4 June in Washington, the three countries 
will settle the level and types of sanctions against North Korea 
and the demands to make on North Korea. From early next week, 
coordination of various views regarding the draft of the 
resolution provided by the United States will be carried out on 
a full scale among the permanent members of the UNSC." 
  Following is an interview with Permanent Representative Yu 
Chong-ha: 
  [Kim Cha-ung] At the 3 June UNSC meeting, Hans Blix, 
secretary general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, 
revealed: "We could not find any technical or safety reasons 
for North Korea to replace the fuel rods at its atomic reactor." 
Does this mean that North Korea intentionally started to 
replace the fuel rods? 
  [Yu Chong-ha] Yes. This means that North Korea replaced the 
fuel rods not because of the technical and safety reasons they 
were insisting on, but for political purposes. North Korea 
intentionally removed the evidence that could have determined 
that it has diverted nuclear material. 
  [Kim] Other than measuring the fuel rods, are there any 
other 
ways to find out whether North Korea has diverted nuclear 
material? 
  [Yu] There is no certain evidence that North Korea diverted 
nuclear material by examining the fuel rods. If nuclear waste 
was examined, we could have had a partial knowledge of whether 
the nuclear material was diverted, but the information is not 
complete. Now, the way to find out about North Korea's nuclear 
activities through the fuel rods has disappeared. 
  [Kim] Does our government firmly support sanctions against 
North Korea? 
  [Yu] Currently, our government's firm position is that the 
move toward sanctions is inevitable. The ROK, the United 
States, and Japan are discussing in Washington the pace and 
method of the sanctions and what demands they will make on North 
Korea. 
  [Kim] What do you think will be the content of the 
sanctions? 
  [Yu] In general, there are three kinds of resolutions for 
sanctions at the UNSC--a resolution of warning, a resolution for 
sanctions in stages, and an overall resolution for sanctions. 
One of them will be applied to North Korea. 
  [Kim] When do you think that a resolution on North Korea 
will 
be adopted? 
  [Yu] It will not be adopted in just one or two days. If you 
look at previous cases, it takes two to three weeks from the 
time the permanent members of the UNSC start to discuss this 
matter and the time a decision is made. Some permanent members 
say that "This is not a time-pressing issue now." The 
opportunity for a later measurement of the fuel rods has been 
lost, but since the discharged fuel rods are under the 
surveillance of the inspection team, permanent members point out 
that it is not a time sensitive issue. 
  [Kim] It is important to see how China will react to the 
resolution against North Korea. What is the attitude of the 
permanent members, including China, regarding this matter? 
  [Yu] I had contact with related ambassadors. China is still 
adhering to the position of "opposing sanctions," which has been 
its position in the past. However, China seemed to sense the 
ROK point of view that there is no other way than to take 
sanctions. France and Great Britain feel strongly about taking 
sanctions. Russia proposed an eight-party meeting in an effort 
to seek other ways to resolve this issue rather than taking 
sanctions.

  [Text] The Democratic Party [DP] held a party caucus at the 
National Assembly building this morning and adopted a resolution 
urging North Korea to stop the nuclear fuel rod replacement 
operation immediately, ensure the nuclear transparency, and 
return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. 
  In the resolution, the DP noted that the present situation 
surrounding the North Korean nuclear issue is very grave and 
stressed that North Korea should fully allow the special 
inspection of the undeclared sites by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency. The DP also urged the government to make 
independent efforts in close cooperation with the United Nations 
and the four neighboring major powers, including the United 
States, to prevent war on the Korean peninsula. The DP also 
called on the United States and the United Nations to do their 
best to maintain dialogue for the peaceful settlement rather 
than resorting to the measures that could result in war.

  [Text] The Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] held a meeting of 
senior party post holders today and discussed measures the party 
should take as the national security is driven into a tense 
situation while international sanctions against the North is 
impending because of the North Korean rejection of nuclear 
inspections. In the meeting, the DLP decided to make efforts to 
have the people become aware of the present security situation. 
  At today's meeting, Yi Se-ki, chairman of the Policy 
Committee, said that the crisis situation resulting from the 
North Korean nuclear issue is heightened because North Korea 
claimed that it would regard any form of sanctions against it as 
an act of war declaration against North Korea. Yi also said 
that in case the UN sanctions turn out to be difficult because 
of the Chinese opposition, despite the fact that measures for 
sanctions are pushed ahead on the part of the United Nations, 
the government is grouping for multinational sanctions among the 
ROK, Japan, and the United States. 
  DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil noted this is the time for the 
people to be precisely aware of the national security situation, 
and stressed the need for the authorities to explain the present 
situation to the people and have them share the correct 
awareness. Chairman Kim Chong-pil stressed that the DLP should 
play a leading role in this.

  [Text] Seoul, June 4 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam's 
government and the ruling Democratic Liberal Party asked the 
main opposition Democratic Party (DP) Saturday to go along with 
them on the North Korean nuclear dispute. 
  The Democratic Party, however, held an emergency meeting of 
its policy-making supreme council Saturday morning and adopted a 
resolution urging the government to work for peaceful resolution 
of the nuclear row through dialogue. 
  "Whatever happens on the peninsula, (we) have to prevent 
another war (in Korea)," the DP said in the resolution, asking 
the government to seek an independent method of settling the 
dispute through active contacts with North Korea. 
  Earlier, First State Minister for Political Affairs So 
Chung-won called DP Chairman Yi Ki-taek and stressed the need to 
form a united political front as the nuclear deadlock has 
reached a critical juncture. Since there would be many stages of 
economic sanctions against North Korea and Seoul does not yet 
know Washington's exact plans, confusion might arise if there is 
a split in the nation's stance on the issue, So said. 
  So promised Yi that the government will brief the opposition 
party on the North Korean problem when President Kim and Seoul's 
ambassador in charge of nuclear affairs, Kim Sang-hun, return 
home. So assured Yi that the government will try to reflect the 
opposition party's position when it works out concrete measures 
on North Korea. 
  The DP resolution also called on the United States and the 
United Nations to refrain from any provocative action and to 
help resolve the row through dialogue. 
  In addition, the Democratic Party asked North Korea to stop 
refueling at the 5-megawatt reactor immediately, and to allow 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to conduct special 
inspections of two unreported nuclear facilities. 
  The opposition party also demanded that Pyongyang guarantee 
the transparency of its nuclear program and scrap its decision 
to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty.

  [Text] Seoul, June 4 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government on Saturday [4 June] denounced as "an extremely 
dangerous idea" the professed plan of North Korea to withdraw 
from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and expand 
nuclear activities. 
  North Korea said in a statement issued by Vice Foreign 
Minister Kang Sok-chu on Friday that they would push ahead with 
their withdrawal from the NPT and would expand "self-reliant 
nuclear energy industry" under the present manner. 
  "This is an extremely dangerous idea that makes a mockery of 
the hope of the international community and all the Korean 
people for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," the 
government said in a statement. 
  The statement released by Yi Song-kon, Seoul-side chairman 
of 
the South-North Joint Nuclear Control Commission, said the 
North's recent unilateral replacement of fuel rods at a 
5-megawatt atomic reactor was an act of fundamentally shattering 
the joint declaration of denuclearization. 
  "We in our part will continue to strive and take all 
available steps to strictly implement the denuclearization 
declaration under all circumstances," it said.

  [Text] Tashkent, June 6 (YONHAP) -- U.N. Security Council 
sanctions against North Korea over its suspected nuclear arms 
program would be substantial and phased, a senior South Korean 
Government official said Sunday. 
  The official, accompanying President Kim Yong-sam on his 
state visit to Uzbekistan, said the Security Council would begin 
discussing sanctions Monday. 
  "Sanctions the U.N. Security Council will apparently impose 
would be so substantial as to cause pain to Pyongyang and would 
be enforced on a phased basis," he said. 
  The official said he saw no problems stopping the Security 
Council from imposing sanctions since Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin promised to support sanctions and China, too, is deeply 
concerned about North Korea's arbitrary replacement of fuel rods. 
  As to the reason for phased sanctions, he said it is because 
the North Koreans still have a chance to ensure the transparency 
of their past nuclear activities. 
  "Though nuclear fuel rods have been replaced, North Korea is 
still able to ensure its nuclear transparency through special 
IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) inspections or in 
other ways dictated by the IAEA," the official said. 
  North Korea, he added, has yet to reprocess the spent fuel 
rods taken from the country's 5-megawatt atomic reactor. 
  Meanwhile, the official said no particular military 
movements 
by North Korea have been detected although Pyongyang is 
repeating its existing policy in a barrage of statements in 
connection with the international move toward sanctions.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Choe Kyu-sik from Tashkent on a </F>
news conference by an unidentified "high-ranking" ROK official 
accompanying President Kim Yong-sam on his visit to Uzbekistan, 
at the Uzbekistan Hotel on 5 June -- first three paragraphs are 
HANGUK ILBO's introduction] 
  [Text] Regarding our government's position on the North 
Korean nuclear development, a high-ranking official accompanying 
President Kim Yong-sam on his visit to Uzbekistan said on 5 
June: "There is no other way now but to take sanctions. 
Allies, including the United States, also recognize that 
sanctions by the UN Security Council must not be carried out 
from simply a symbolic level but from a practical level." 
  This high-ranking official held a news conference with 
reporters accompanying President Kim on the afternoon of 5 June 
at the Uzbekistan Hotel in Tashkent, where they are staying, and 
explained the background and prospects of the consultations held 
for taking sanctions against North Korea by the UN Security 
Council. He also revealed: "Discussions on the North Korean 
nuclear issue will be carried out on a full scale starting this 
week." 
  This official added: "The government's position is that the 
sanctions must be carried out in stages. We plan to discuss 
this matter with allies so that practical sanctions can be 
carried out on a step-by-step basis." 
  Following is a summary of the news conference: 
  [Reporter] What is the reason for carrying out step-by-step 
sanctions? 
  [Official] It is to give North Korea the opportunity to 
prove 
the transparency of its past nuclear activities. The method to 
clarify North Korea's past nuclear activities has not yet 
disappeared completely. Other than measuring the replaced fuel 
rods, we can clarify it through a special inspection [tukpyol 
sachal] or other inspection methods. Sanctions are not meant to 
block the opportunity to prove its transparency from the 
beginning. 
  [Reporter] What are the moves being taken by North Korea? 
  [Official] There is nothing peculiar. Up-to-date 
intelligence capabilities that can inspect every corner of North 
Korea 24 hours a day have been mobilized on a full scale. A 
close posture of military preparedness has been assumed between 
the ROK and the United States, and we can strengthen it further 
if necessary. We expect that there will be no provocations from 
North Korea. 
  [Reporter] What is China's position? 
  [Official] When Tang Jiaxuan, Chinese deputy foreign 
minister, visited the ROK from 2 to 4 June, and held the 
ROK-China deputy foreign ministers meeting, they discussed the 
North Korean nuclear issue. It is known that China also 
expressed worry and interest over the fact that North Korea 
decided to go ahead and replace the fuel rods. 
  [Reporter] What is North Korea's attitude? 
  [Official] The recent remark by North Korean Vice Foreign 
Minister Kang Sok-chu emphasizes the inevitability of replacing 
the fuel rods, and that if the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks is 
held, the issue of special and ad hoc inspections [tukpyol mit 
imsi sachal] can be resolved. This shows that there is no 
change in its existing position. 
  [Reporter] Other than the sanctions by the UN Security 
Council, are independent sanctions against North among the 
allies including the ROK, the United States, and Japan being 
examined? 
  [Official] Under the current situation I believe that it 
will 
be possible to take sanctions through a UN Security Council 
resolution. Of course, we cannot eliminate various 
possibilities, and since President Kim received Russia's promise 
for a firm support during his visit to Russia, we will work to 
promote sanctions through a UN Security Council resolution.

  [Text] This morning, the government held a public-national 
security affairs-related ministers' meeting on North Korea's 
nuclear development. It decided to take all necessary 
countermeasures at home and abroad based on a firm policy to 
prevent by all means North Korea's nuclear development situation 
from causing public uncertainty or threatening the stability of 
the people's livelihood. 
  At today's meeting, presided over by Prime Minister Yi 
Yong-tok, the government analyzed North Korea's recent responses 
and military movements, checked our Armed Forces' preparedness 
and the government's readiness for an emergency, and discussed 
ways to consolidate a pangovernmental preparedness for national 
security by unifying the national view. 
  At today's meeting, the government decided to take all 
necessary countermeasures at home and abroad to prevent the 
situation which might cause public uncertainty or threaten the 
stability of people's livelihood in the midst of the rapidly 
developing situation, including the international community's 
move toward imposing sanctions against North Korea. 
  The government will also continue to maintain close 
cooperation with the United States for establishing a quick 
military preparedness in the event of an emergency, while 
increasing an all-time capability of gathering information by 
operating at full capacity the national security-related 
permanent consultative system between the ROK and the United 
States. In the meantime, the government will concentrate on 
making diplomatic efforts to see our position accomplished in 
the international community based on the successes of President 
Kim Yong-sam's diplomacy through his visits. 
  At the same time, the government will focus on establishing 
in-country public security by strongly dealing with, and taking 
legal measures against, those pro-communist forces that 
sympathize with or praise North Korea's allegations as seen at 
the ceremony launching the activities of the Korean Federation 
of General Student Councils [Hanchongnyon].

  [Text] The ROK Government has decided to ensure that the 
resolution the UN Security Council would adopt urges North Korea 
to accept the International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] 
inspection of the two unreported facilities. 
  The government also reportedly decided that North Korea's 
acceptance of this special inspection be made a precondition for 
the end of the possible sanctions. 
  Toward this end, the government has decided to make 
diplomatic efforts to ensure that at least two provisions -- 
restrictions on the remittance of money from Japan to North 
Korea and a ban on weapons exports to North Korea -- are 
included in the resolution on sanctions. 
  Still, the government plans to pursue phased sanctions to 
ensure that the possibility of resolving the nuclear issue 
through dialogue is left open. It also plans to ensure that the 
resolution specifies the deadline for the resumption of dialogue 
between North Korea and the IAEA. 
  Prior to this, the ROK, the United States, and Japan had 
emergency tripartite talks in Washington and New York on 4 June. 
At the talks, the ROK Government reportedly presented this plan 
and got an affirmative response from the two countries. 
  An ROK Government official said on 5 June: "Special 
inspections are the only means to verify North Korea's past 
nuclear activities because North Korea continued to replace fuel 
rods." 
  He also said: "The government's policy is to ensure that 
special inspections be a precondition for an end to sanctions." 
  This official also said that "the ROK, the United States, 
and 
Japan have reached agreement on this matter." 
  He also said that "the government believes that if sanctions 
are to produce effects, they must be ones painful to North 
Korea," adding that "the government plans to make every effort 
to include in the resolution restrictions on remittance of money 
to North Korea and a ban on weapons exports to North Korea, 
which would deal a direct blow to North Korea." 
  He also said that "the most important thing is not the 
content of the resolution but China's support for sanctions." 
He predicted that the toughness and level of the resolution on 
sanctions would be decided depending on China's attitude."

  [Text] Seoul, June 6 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
will invite leaders of the three branches of government, the 
ruling Democratic Liberal Party and the opposition Democratic 
Party to a luncheon at Chongwadae [presidential offices] 
Wednesday to brief them on the results of his visit to Russia 
and discuss suprapartisan action on North Korea's nuclear 
program. 
  Kim will explain the latest developments concerning the 
North's nuclear ambitions and urge the attendees to make 
suprapartisan efforts to cope with any contingencies that 
international sanctions against Pyongyang might entail, informed 
sources in the ruling camp said Monday. 
  Opposition Democratic Party Chairman Yi Ki-taek, in the 
meantime, is expected to stress the need to solve the problem 
peacefully on the basis of his party's position that war should 
not break out under any circumstances. 
  The opposition leader is also likely to urge that sanctions, 
if deemed inevitable, should not be initiated by only three 
countries -- South Korea, the United States and Japan -- but by 
the United Nations as a whole.

<F P=106> [By Kim Kyo-chun, from the "Central Tower" column] </F>
  [Text] Some of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] 
lawmakers criticized on 6 June that the government's 
countermeasure to the North Korean nuclear issue is slovenly 
under the present tense situation in the phase of sanctions 
against North Korea. 
  A lawmaker of the Foreign Affairs and Reunification 
Committee 
of the National Assembly said: "While the president said that 
the people do not have to worry, the prime minister asked the 
people to strengthen their alert posture. Their contradictory 
remarks were made on the same day." He then added: "Under this 
situation, it is natural for the political circles to have been 
divided into hard- liners and moderates." 
  He also said: "We are in an emergency state requiring all 
the people to wear gas masks. The government, however, assumes 
an inadequate attitude." 
  Another lawmaker who asked not to be identified said: "The 
people's lack of security sense is a result of the government's 
muddled position. It seems that officials concerned do not 
fully understand President Kim Yong-sam's policy on dealing with 
the North Korean nuclear issue." 
  The lawmaker continued: "Demonstrations by the Korean 
Federation of University Student Councils and the workers' 
struggle to establish the second Federation of Korean Trade 
Unions will likely be intensified when the issue of sanctions 
against North Korea passes a critical moment." He then 
stressed, "Measures to minimize the internal confusion to be 
caused by this must be prepared."

  [Text] Hong Kong, June 5 (YONHAP) -- North Korea, facing 
U.N. sanctions for its suspected nuclear arms development 
program, recently bid for the import of some 100 consumer items, 
including rice, corn and sugar, from Hong Kong traders. 
  A trader, who has received North Korea's written inquiry 
about the import, told YONHAP News Agency Saturday that North 
Korean businesses had placed with many Hong Kong traders orders 
for rice, corn, sugar and some 100 other consumer items, 
hurrying to strike deals by the early part of June. 
  The trader, who has long business relations with North 
Korea, 
said North Korea had informed him that it would send a 
three-member government buying mission, headed by the vice 
chairman of the Light Industry Commission, to China's special 
economic district of Zhuhai in southern Guangdong Province in 
early June. 
  The North Korean mission will stay in a dormitory for 
members 
of the five North Korean firms operating in Zhuhai, not in a 
hotel for security reasons, for seven days, making deals with 
Hong Kong traders in the dormitory, he added. 
  Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said he could not 
disclose a full list of the items, including the quantities and 
values, North Korea ordered because of the business interest 
involved. 
  In addition to making deals with Hong Kong traders, the 
North 
Korean mission will meet a Hong Kong lawyer in Zhuhai to discuss 
ways of recovering the 4 million U.S. dollars still remaining in 
North Korea's deposits in the bankrupt Bank of Credit and 
Commerce International in Hong kong, the trader said. 
  North Korea has withdrawn 6 million dollars out of the 10 
million dollars it deposited in the Hong Kong bank since its 
declaration of bankruptcy in 1991.

  [Text] South Korean firms are canceling plans to place 
orders with North Korea to process raw materials for light 
industrial products as the U.N. Security Council is moving to 
impose economic sanctions against the communist country. 
  According to officials of the nation's leading general 
trading companies, the U.N.'s move is forcing them to refrain 
from continuing the limited form of cooperation between them and 
North Korea. 
  A typical form of cooperation now is South Korean firms 
sending material for light goods, including textiles and toys, 
to their North Korean partners for processing. 
  The officials said domestic companies which have done 
business with North Korea in this way will stop trading with the 
country if the West-led economic sanctions materialize. 
  Samsung Corp., a trading arm of the Samsung Business Group, 
is expected to abandon a project commissioning its North Korean 
partner to produce low-end apparel, said Chong Chin-chol, who is 
responsible for the firm's business projects with the North. 
  "Despite the nuclear issue, we have thus far promoted 
economic cooperation between North and South Korea. But, in the 
future, we will respect any decision by the Korean Government 
concerning economic sanctions against the North," he said. 
  However, Chong declined to comment on whether Samsung Corp. 
will stop contacting North Korean Government's officials in 
third nations or not. Through an agent in Beijing, the firm has 
kept a close communication channel with high-ranking Pyongyang 
officials. 
  Hyundai Corp., a trading arm of the Hyundai Business Group, 
is also expected to stop importing $2 million-worth of zinc 
plates and scrap iron from the North until it completely 
abandons its nuclear program, a Hyundai official said. 
  Along with the two general trading companies, Daewoo Corp. 
has already decided not to import steel ores and coals from the 
reclusive communist nation, said Mun Ki-hwan, a manager of the 
company. 
  In addition, the trading arm of the Daewoo Business Group 
will no longer be involved in any processing contract with its 
North Korean partner for textile production as long as the 
country tries to go nuclear, Mun said. 
  With the West coming perilously close to the precipice of 
sanctions against Pyongyang, Lucky-Goldstar International Corp. 
has decided to reserve projects to commission its North Korean 
firms to produce apparel and audio speakers, an official said. 
  In 1993, inter-Korea trade fell 6 percent to $200 million 
from $213 million in 1992 mainly because of Pyongyang's shortage 
of foreign exchange and the nuclear issue which cooled overall 
inter-Korea relations. 
  To reserve such indirect trading projects with North Korea 
will never bring South Korean businesses huge damages, said Kim 
Yong-sin, a manager of the Inter-Korea Trade Department at the 
Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA). 
  However, Kim expressed worry over the fact that if South 
Korean businesses stop trading with North Korea because of the 
West-led sanctions, it'll take a long period of time for them to 
revive trade relations with the North in the future.

  [Text] It has been learned that the government is actively 
examining the possibility of compensating up to 90 percent of 
the losses from the South-North cooperative fund, if ROK 
companies that trade with North Korea suffer losses as a result 
of economic sanctions against North Korea. 
  A high-ranking official of the National Unification Board 
said on 4 June: "It is expected that companies that trade with 
the North will suffer losses if trade between the South and 
North, including processing on commission, and direct and 
indirect trade, is entirely suspended. The government is 
actively examining the possibility of compensating up to 90 
percent of the losses according to Article 26, which stipulates 
the regulations on operating and managing the South-North 
cooperative fund." 
  The reason the government decided to actively examine this 
matter is that the losses the companies will suffer will not be 
due to mistakes in concluding contracts with the North Korean 
companies or to negligence in its management, but due to a 
special situation between the South and North. 
  In April 1991, the government enacted the "regulation on 
operating and managing the South-North cooperative fund," and in 
July of the same year, 5,000 tonnes of rice were exported to 
North Korea. However, since our side did not receive the money 
for it from the Chinji Trading Company, our side received 
compensation for 1.268 billion won from the South-North exchange 
cooperative fund for the losses suffered. 
  Currently there are 145 billion won in the South-North 
exchange cooperative fund. 
  The official also said: "If we determine that the companies 
that conduct trade with North Korea are not able to retrieve the 
amount of loss or is impossible to retrieve it by the end of 
this year, we will receive applications from the related 
companies and examine whether the companies can receive 
assistance according to the regulation on assistance to restore 
national commonwealth (Chapter 9, Article 67) of the regulation 
on operating and managing the fund." 
  The companies that may be able to receive compensation are 
Samsung Products Company; Lucky-Gold Star Trading Company; 
Daewoo; Kohap Trading Company; Hanil Synthetic Fiber Company; 
and Hyosong Products Company that exported subsidiary raw 
materials for processing on commission, and small-sized 
companies that gave money in advance under the condition that 
North Korea will bring in the goods.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Choe Kyu-sik on ROK President Kim </F>
Yong-sam's news briefing for ROK journalists aboard the plane en 
route to Tashkent on 4 June] 
  [Text] [question] Are there any behind-the-scenes stories 
of the summit at the dacha? 
  [Kim Yong-sam] Russian Foreign Ministry officials had asked 
me many times not to raise serious issues since the dacha 
meeting was especially arranged for friendship. I said that 
anything could be discussed in a summit and asked them to leave 
it up to me. President Yeltsin seemed to have expected trivial 
subjects such as family or hobbies. He seemed to be surprised 
when I raised the pending issues right after the small talk. 
However, the atmosphere was very light. 
  [Question] What was the background of the decision to 
suspend 
the supply and sales of Russian weapons and parts to North Korea? 
  [Kim] President Yeltsin had been holding on to his difficult 
position. He said that at least the supply of parts for North 
Korea's defensive weapons should continue. I asked how could 
offensive and defensive weapons be differentiated and insisted 
that the supply should not continue, not even for the sake of 
money. I persuaded him not to provide parts or technology 
saying that even if North Korea possessed 100 weapons, those 
would be useless if Russia did not provide advanced military 
technology and arms. The same went with nuclear weapons. I 
insisted that no concessions could be made and we could not come 
to a conclusion that night. During the next day's tete-a-tete 
talks, we could not reach an agreement either until the last 
moment when President Yeltsin hit the table with both hands and 
abruptly stood up saying: "I will make the concession to 
President Kim" and concluded the talks. 
  [Question] What did you talk about with U.S. President 
Clinton over the telephone on 3 June? 
  [Kim] We talked about everything we wanted for 35 minutes. 
Although only two points were allowed to be announced, I think 
our people should not worry about anything. The United States 
has completely finished armed preparations for any contingency. 
An around-the-clock surveillance system on North Korean 
movements is in operation. Of course, a war should be prevented 
but our people may be relieved because all preparations have 
been completed for any contingency. Commander Gary Luck of the 
ROK-U.S. Combined Forces is a very deliberate man. He was in 
the Gulf war and has an outstanding sense of modern warfare. It 
is very significant to have someone like him in the ROK. 
Everything is well prepared and arranged. 
  [Question] Is it certain that Russia will participate in the 
UN Security Council's sanctions on North Korea? 
  [Kim] Of course. Did President Yeltsin not say clearly in 
the 
joint news conference that Russia will participate? China is 
known to have great influence on North Korea but actually China 
gives North Korea nothing more than petroleum. Russia is the 
country that gives weapons to North Korea and its relations with 
North Korea are not simple. 
  [Question] What will happen to the North Korean loggers 
issue? 
  [Kim] The loggers are like people without a nation. They 
have had their passports seized by North Korean security 
officers. I told President Yeltsin that none of the loggers 
would be able to come to the ROK Embassy holding a passport and 
that Russia should check each of the loggers to see if they are 
holding a passport at the time of their entry to Russia. 
President Yeltsin firmly promised me that every logger should 
have a passport with him when they come to Russia or that they 
would not be allowed to enter the country. 
  [Question] What was the discussion on reinforcing economic 
cooperation between the ROK and Russia? 
  [Kim] Among the many discussions, Russia said it was 
confident that it could build gas pipelines through North Korea 
to provide the huge volume of gas consumed by the ROK. We 
agreed to equally share the feasibility study cost of $20 
million. Russia has a plan to provide gas to the ROK on a 
long-term basis.

<F P=106> [Speech by ROK Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok delivered at the </F>
ROK Memorial Day Ceremony held at the National Cemetery in 
Tongjak-dong, Seoul--live] 
  [Text] My fellow countrymen, men who have done meritorious 
deeds for the country, and members of the families of the war 
dead: 
  Today, on the meaningful 39th Memorial Day, we are here to 
uphold the will of the souls of those who dedicated their lives 
to the fatherland and the nation, while paying tribute to their 
noble spirit. 
  First of all, together with all countrymen, I pray for the 
repose of the souls of those who are resting at this sacred 
place of the nation, respectfully bowing before their souls. 
  At the same time, I would like to say words of deep respect 
and consolation to those who have done meritorious deeds and 
members of the families of those who have dedicated their lives 
to the country, who have only lived indefatigably for the 
country and the society with dignity and purposeful life even 
under the difficult circumstances, and those military servicemen 
and policemen who are still suffering in the hospital from the 
wounds they suffered during the Korean war and the Vietnamese 
war. 
  Fellow countrymen: 
  We are enjoying much freedom and prosperity today and have 
been able to secure a firm position in the world. We owe this 
to the noble sacrifice of those who have done meritorious deeds 
for the country, including the deceased patriots and the war 
dead. 
  They dedicated with delight their flowering youth in the 
Korean and Vietnamese wars, thereby laying the foundation for 
bringing today's remarkable development and democracy into 
blossom. 
  At this solemn ceremony today, we should solidify our 
resolve 
to repay their patriotic loyalty by deeply bearing in our mind 
the real meaning of the fatherland that they defended with blood 
and sweat. 
  The country they really wanted was a unified fatherland in 
which the whole nation can enjoy a happy life amid abundance 
while all people's freedom and human rights are respected and 
democracy is rooted. 
  Today's world, in which communism has collapsed and the 
ideological confrontation between the East and West has ended, 
clearly shows that their faith in free democracy was correct. 
  However, the unchanged confrontational aspect of the Cold 
War 
era still remains on the Korean peninsula, the ground for our 
Korean nation's living, the only example of such a kind on earth. 
  Under these circumstances, looking at our compatriots who 
have fled the North who are suffering from all kinds of 
hardships while wandering about China and Russia, we cannot but 
feel warm compassion and patriotic love toward the North Korean 
residents whose basic human rights are not being guaranteed. 
  This is why we feel reverence toward the great meritorious 
deeds of those who dedicated their lives to the country--who 
made today's ROK possible with a firm faith in the future of 
their nation--when the fate of the fatherland was at stake. 
  Fellow countrymen: 
  The reality of our national security is that the vigilance 
against the North is increasingly weakening [taebuk kyonggaksimi 
chomcha huibakhaejigo issomyo] in spite of the fact that North 
Korea is pushing for its southward strategy in the reunification 
front and its nuclear development at a heightened level and that 
even a callousness to national security is spreading and we are 
not noticing it. 
  We should resolutely cope with those forces that are 
threatening our free democratic system and should exercise 
wisdom and sagacity to prepare with composure for a unified 
fatherland of tomorrow based on a firm view of the country and a 
sense of national security, while giving up hasty expectations 
or illusions on the unification. 
  Now is the time to concentrate all national strength on 
increasing the national competitive power at a time when we are 
faced with an important stage that will determine the future of 
the nation. This notwithstanding, some circles in our society 
are putting forth reckless claims and allegations, and excessive 
selfishness. This is very worrisome. 
  Even under these circumstances, all our countrymen should 
establish a mature democratic society through participation and 
reconciliation from a broadminded viewpoint of developing a 
national community. 
  Souls of those who dedicated their lives for the country: 
  We do not forget even for a moment your meritorious deeds, 
who made today's fatherland possible by defending the free 
democracy in this land. We will establish a blissful country 
where freedom and justice overflows and open the era of the 
Korean nation which will toweringly stand in the world to repay 
your sacrifice. 
  The government will make further efforts in providing your 
beloved descendants with material and spiritual courteous 
treatment to help them enjoy their life with honor and dignity, 
thereby helping the spirit of your noble patriotism lay in the 
hearts of the countrymen forever. 
  Today, on this meaningful Memorial Day, we respectfully pray 
for the repose of the souls of those who are resting at the 
National Cemetery--the sacred ground of the nation--once again 
paying tribute to them, while recalling once again the patriotic 
loyalty of the war dead and those who dedicated their lives to 
the country.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
are most likely to hold subcabinet-level talks from June 9 or 10 
to find ways to improve American access to Japan's auto and auto 
parts markets, a senior Japanese trade ministry official said 
Friday [3 June]. 
  Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice international trade and industry 
minister for international affairs, and Jeffrey Garten, commerce 
undersecretary, will probably meet in Tokyo for three days, said 
the official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI), who declined to be named. 
  The planned talks will follow ongoing working-level auto and 
auto parts negotiations that started Thursday in Washington for 
a two-day run. 
  The coming high-level meeting is designed to set objective 
criteria as a tool to measure the openness of Japan's auto 
markets and as a mechanism to review progress in bilateral auto 
trade, the MITI official said. 
  During the Okamatsu-Garten meeting, Washington will also 
give 
a specific response to measures on auto trade adopted by Japan 
as part of its market-opening measures announced at the end of 
March, the official said. 
  In the ongoing working-level talks in Washington, the 
official said the U.S. "Highly appreciated" the Japanese 
measures, which focus on voluntary industry efforts to expand 
purchases of U.S.-made cars under the "cooperation approach."

  [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
resumed telecommunications trade talks Friday [3 June] by taking 
stock of their positions since talks collapsed in February, a 
Japanese official said. 
  Negotiators had a "wide-ranging discussion" on government 
procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment, the 
last of three priority sector talks to resume in bilateral trade 
"framework" talks, said the Foreign Ministry official. 
  He described the meeting after a hiatus of three and a half 
months as a get-reaquainted session, saying "a decision would be 
impossible" in a day. 
  Talks between the U.S. Trade Representative's Office and 
Japan's Finance, Trade and Telecommunications Ministries will 
continue with a full-day session Saturday, he said. But no 
deadline has been set, said the official, who briefed reporters 
on condition his name not be used. 
  He would not comment on whether the negotiators discussed 
"objective criteria" or the treatment of Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone Corp. (NTT) -- two key issues in the sectoral talks. 
  U.S. Officials were not available for comment. 
  How to assess market-opening progress is the biggest 
remaining issue in the field, on which the two sides are 
"nine-tenths of the way toward agreement," a ministry official 
said earlier. 
  Also at issue is whether to include NTT in the talks, with 
Japan insisting it is a private company but the U.S. stressing

  [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Japan reiterated its concern 
Friday [3 June] over North Korea's defiance of international 
calls for inspections of its nuclear reactor and suspicions that 
Pyongyang is trying to develop atomic weapons. 
  "We are deeply concerned about this situation," Chief 
Government Spokesman Hiroshi Kumagai said at a news conference. 
"We would like to weigh what action to take in close concert 
with the countries involved such as the United States, South 
Korea and China." 
  A government source said Japan will act in concert with 
Washington in case the U.S. and China fail to resolve 
differences over UN sanctions against Pyongyang. "Although we 
talk with China, too, Japan-U.S. relations are the basis of our 
policy," the source said. 
  On Thursday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
said the North Korean refusal to let inspectors conduct an 
unimpeded check of fuel rods removed from a suspect nuclear 
reactor has made it impossible to verify whether Pyongyang 
diverted plutonium in the past to manufacture atomic bombs. 
  Hans Blix, the IAEA director general, said in a letter to 
the 
UN Security Council that the Vienna-based agency "cannot achieve 
the overall objective of comprehensive safeguards...namely to 
provide assurance about the nondiversion of nuclear material."

  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Senior Foreign Ministry 
officials held an emergency meeting Thursday [2 June] to discuss 
Japan's response in the event of UN sanctions against North 
Korea for its renewed refusal to allow nuclear inspections. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito returned early from a 
European tour to attend the meeting, which set the line for 
trilateral consultations with the United States and South Korea 
expected to be held Friday in Washington. 
  The U.S. has warned it will seek economic sanctions against 
North Korea if the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is 
prevented from examining discharged nuclear fuel rods at the 
5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon to determine whether spent fuel 
has been diverted to manufacture nuclear weapons. 
  North Korea over the past two weeks has been removing spent 
fuel rods from the reactor and is expected to have fully 
reloaded the reactor within one or two days. 
  The IAEA has warned that its capacity to carry out tests 
will 
be lost "in days" unless Pyongyang halts the unmonitored fuel 
exchange and places the discharged rods under international 
supervision. 
  The Washington consultations aim at formulating joint 
punitive measures against North Korea in case China, the 
communist nation's longtime ally, vetoes a UN Security Council 
resolution threatening economic sanctions. 
  Washington is expected to reiterate its demand that Tokyo 
halt yen remittances to North Korea from pro-Pyongyang 
organizations and residents in Japan, which are believed to be a 
major source of foreign currency for the isolationist, 
economically weak country. 
  The talks will also "prepare for the worst scenario," a 
ministry source said, alluding to a possible military 
confrontation over the nuclear issue. 
  North Korea has repeatedly prevented IAEA inspectors from 
carrying out full inspections of its nuclear plants, fueling 
suspicions that it is secretly developing nuclear weapons. 
  Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata expressed 
grave concern over North Korea's refusal to comply with the UN 
and its nuclear watchdog's inspection demands. 
  "If (North Korea) does not talk without reserve, it will 
lead 
to an undesirable direction," Hata told reporters at his 
official residence. "North Korea should take a serious view of 
the concern of the international community." 
  A government spokesman later said Japan's position is to 
seek 
a peaceful resolution of North Korea's nuclear issue. 
  "We still hope this issue will be resolved in a peaceful 
manner through efforts by the parties concerned," Deputy Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Nobuo Ishihara told a news conference. 
  Ishihara also noted the government is scrutinizing North 
Korea's virtual refusal to accept Monday's Security Council 
statement urging Pyongyang to comply with nuclear safeguard 
requirements. 
  Despite the harshly worded rejection, Ishihara said, no 
noticeable shift in North Korea's stance on the matter can be 
seen. 
  A high-ranking Foreign Ministry official later said 
three-way 
talks among Japan, the U.S. and South Korea in Washington on 
Friday will focus on measures to deal with potential action by 
the UN Security Council. 
  The options are either the implementation of sanctions or a 
warning if North Korea continues to reject international 
inspections, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
  The official said the three countries will explore the 
possibility of supporting a step-by-step approach to the North 
Korean nuclear issue, an approach which would win China's 
support.

  [Text] Vice-premier and Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam sent 
a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali regarding 
an important measure [chungdaehan chochi] taken by the DPRK 
Government recently to establish a new peace guarantee system 
[saeroun pyonghwa pojang chegye] on the Korean peninsula. The 
letter is as follows: 
  His Excellency Butrus Butrus-Ghali, UN Secretary General: 
  Esteemed His Excellency Secretary General, 
  Paying my respects to Your Excellency, I send this letter to 
you regarding an important measure taken by the government of 
the Republic recently to establish a new peace guarantee system 
on the Korean peninsula. 
  As you know already, the DPRK Government, through a 
statement 
of the Foreign Ministry on 28 April, proposed to the United 
States to hold negotiations to establish a new peace guarantee 
system that would replace the old armistice mechanism. 
  As you confirmed personally during your visit to our country 
toward the end of last year, an unstable [pulanjonghan] state of 
truce, neither peace nor war, has lasted for over 40 years on 
the Korean peninsula. 
  The situation on the Korean peninsula has become all the 
more 
strained [kinjang haejigo issumyo] and the possibility of a 
total armed conflict is gradually increasing [chonmyon muryok 
chungdolui kanungsongun chomjom to kojigo issumnida] with the 
amassing of huge reinforcements in and around South Korea and 
the stepping up of military actions against us on the pretext of 
the nuclear issue by the United States from the start of this 
year. 
  The Korean Armistice Agreement and its observation mechanism 
should have controlled such actions, but they have failed to 
play any role due to the U.S. side's systematic acts of division 
and destruction [chegyejogin yurin malsal haengwiro hayo]. 
  In 1956, the United States expelled the Neutral Nations 
Inspection teams stationed at appropriate ports of entry under 
Paragraph C, Article 2 of the Korean Armistice Agreement from 
the area under its control and, on June 21, 1957, it 
unilaterally renounced Subparagraph 13d of the Korean Armistice 
Agreement which stipulates that the introduction into Korea of 
reinforcing combat equipment shall be ceased. Since then, the 
United States has shipped sophisticated weapons including over 
1,000 pieces of nuclear weapons into South Korea without any 
restrictions and it has become all the more undisguised of late 
in its shipments of such combat equipment. 
  While working to systematically destroy [chegyejoguro pagoe 
hayo odaga] the military armistice mechanism, the U.S. side 
completely paralyzed [wanjonhi mabi sikyossumnida] it on March 
25, 1991, by unilaterally appointing a South Korean serviceman 
as the senior member of the UN Forces side to the Military 
Armistice Commission [MAC] without any legal justification or 
qualification in view of the Armistice Agreement. 
  Present-day reality in which the basic provisions of the 
Armistice Agreement that should guarantee peace on the Korean 
peninsula have been scrapped [pagi toeyotko] and the armistice 
observation mechanism now remains in name only, requires that 
decisive measures [kyolchongjok taechaek] be taken to establish 
a new security guarantee system to save the situation [sataerul 
susubhago] which has reached a danger line [wihom kyeson] and to 
prevent arms buildup and the outbreak of another war. 
  In fact, the Korean Armistice Agreement signed on 27 July 
1953, was a tentative measure taken to stop combat actions 
between the two hostile sides [kyojon ssangbangsaiui] in 
anticipation of future conversion into a peace agreement. 
  Therefore, the adoption of resolution 3390-B, calling for 
the 
dissolution of the UN command and the replacement of the 
Armistice Agreement by a peace agreement at the 30th session of 
the UN General Assembly in 1975, was a very just measure [maeu 
chongdanghan chochi] to ensure a lasting peace [hangujogin 
pyonghwa] on the Korean peninsula and it opened a bright 
prospect for the final solution [chonggukchok haegyol] of the 
Korean question. 
  The DPRK Government has taken initiatives and proposed 
negotiations on many occasions to ensure durable peace [kongohan 
pyonghwa] on the Korean peninsula and made tireless efforts 
[kkujunhi noryok hayossumnida] to put them into effect. 
  Nonaggression was vowed by the North and the South through 
the agreement on reconciliation, nonaggression, cooperation and 
exchange between the North and the South adopted in 1992 as a 
result of our positive efforts. But we are still in a state of 
truce vis-a-vis the United States which keeps its Armed Forces 
stationed in South Korea. 
  The UN command, recognized as a signatory to the Armistice 
Agreement, serves the strategic aim of the United States to 
isolate and stifle [korip apsal] us and establish control over 
Asia and the Pacific region, which is an aim which has nothing 
to do with the UN mission to keep peace in South Korea. I 
think, therefore, that there is no condition for the U.S. Forces 
present in South Korea to act as the UN Forces any longer. 
  Taking into consideration the actual conditions where a 
grave 
situation threatening peace [pyonghwarul wihyop hanun omjunghan 
sataega] had been created on the Korean peninsula but there was 
no rational institutional mechanism capable of controlling it, 
the DPRK Government proposed to the U.S. side to negotiate the 
establishment of a new durable peace guarantee system that will 
replace the old armistice mechanism and, at the same time, took 
practical measures, recalling all the members of the Korean 
People's Army [KPA] side from the MAC, setting up the KPA 
mission at Panmunjom as a new mechanism for negotiations with 
the U.S. Forces side and of appointing the chief and members of 
the mission. 
  This is, to all intents and purposes, an innovative and 
well-intentioned step [hyoksinjogigo sonuijogin chochi] to make 
a breakthrough in establishing a new security guarantee system 
for peace on the Korean peninsula and a peaceloving step that 
took into account the publicly accepted international usage 
whereby some countries abandoned the relationship of hostilities 
after the Second World War and declared peace relationship 
instead. 
  I think that the United Nations must pay due attention to 
our 
proposal in the sense of liquidating its unpleasant past affairs 
[pulmihan kwagorul chongsan hanun] with our country, its member 
state, and in the sense of fulfilling its resolution to replace 
the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement. 
  The nuclear issue over which some countries are now making a 
fuss is, in fact, not a question to be discussed by the United 
Nations, but one that must be solved through DPRK-U.S. dialogue 
[chomi taehwa]. 
  If the United Nations, yields to the unjust demand 
[pudanghan 
yogudaero] of some countries and attempts to resolve the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula in such a manner as to impose 
sanctions on someone else, it will, no doubt, bring catastrophic 
consequences menacing peace [pyonghwarul wihyop hanun 
pagukchogin hukwarul kajo oriranun koson] in Asia and the rest 
of the world, not to speak of the Korean peninsula. 
  With a view to accelerating [taguchigi wihayo] the process 
of 
replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement in 
accordance with the resolution of the 30th General Assembly, the 
United Nations must take a practical step to dismantle the UN 
command, a framework of the old armistice structure. 
  In conclusion, I express the hope that Your Excellency will 
pay particular attention to our peace overture to establish a 
new peace guarantee system through DPRK-U.S. negotiations [chomi 
hyopsang] and actively cooperate in its materialization.

<F P=106> ["Press Statement [tamhwa]" by a spokesman of the DPRK </F>
Atomic Energy General Department on 2 June -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK General Department of the 
Atomic Energy issued a press statement yesterday [2 June] 
denouncing the unjust pressure commotion [pudanghan amnyok 
sodongul kyutanhaeso] by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] and some member nations of the UN Security Council over 
our core refueling operations [nosim yollyo kyoche]. 
  The press statement reads: 
  Recently, the IAEA Secretariat submitted to the UN Security 
Council a wrong report related to the core refueling operations 
at the five megawatt experimental nuclear power plant in the 
DPRK, misrepresenting facts as if our method of the core 
refueling operations would make the technical possibility of the 
later measurement of fuel rods difficult. Accordingly, the UN 
Security Council hastily adopted a so-called presidential 
statement. 
  As is known, our five megawatt experimental nuclear power 
plant had no other choice but to begin the core refueling 
operations from early May for technical or safety reasons. 
  Since we are in a special status [tuksu chiwi] following the 
temporary suspension of the effectuation of our declared 
withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, we are not 
under obligation to accept routine and ad hoc inspections 
[chonggi mit pijonggi sachal] under the safeguards agreement but 
are obligated only to ensure inspection in the scope for the 
continuity of safeguards [tamboui yonsoksong pojange piryohan 
pomwiui sacharul pojanghamyon toenda]. 
  The selection and securing [sontaek pogwan] of some fuel 
rods 
requested by the IAEA with regard to the core refueling 
operations is activities for the verification of the 
completeness of the initial report. In the long run, this 
activity falls under the category of ad hoc inspection. 
  Therefore, the selection and securing of some fuel rods can 
never be allowed before our special status is dissolved 
[haesodoegi chonenun]. 
  But, we are doing the core refueling operations in such a 
manner to fully guarantee [chungbunhi pojonhanun pangboburo] the 
technical possibility for later measurement of such fuel rods as 
requested by the agency in token of good faith [sonuijok chochie 
ttara], anticipating a dissolution of our special status. 
  At present, the operations of the core refueling and all the 
fuel in the transfer channel, spent fuel tub [pyeyollyo sujo] 
and damaged fuel dry storage [pason yollyo konsik pogwango] are 
under strict containment [pongswae] and surveillance by the 
agency. 
  Two surveillance cameras installed by the agency at the 
reactor hall, where refueling is going on, are monitoring the 
core area [nosim kuyok], fuel channels, equipment hatch, and 
movements of the refueling machines. The agency's spent fuel 
rod counter system [pyeyollyo kyesugi] with a silicon 
semi-conductor detector [kyuso pandoche komchulgi], a fission 
chamber [punyolham], an ionization chamber, and a position 
sensor has been installed in the spent fuel discharge channel to 
constantly measure and count the spent fuel being discharged 
into baskets. 
  The agency has installed thermoluminescence detectors and 
sealing devices in all the channels which may be considered to 
be diversion paths and two surveillance cameras in the building 
of the spent fuel tub to monitor and control the flow of nuclear 
material. 
  Notably, at the time of the inspection in May, in order to 
increase efficiency of the surveillance devices of the IAEA 
during the refueling, we provided all the conditions requested 
by the agency, such as the replacement of computers and their 
parts in the spent fuel rod counter [pyeyollyo kyesugi], the 
installation of uninterruptable power [mujongjon chonwon] supply 
to the IAEA surveillance devices and a lighting system for the 
spent fuel tub building. 
  Thus, the non-diversion of nuclear material during the 
refueling is firmly guaranteed. This is admitted by the 
inspectors of the agency now observing the whole procedure of 
refueling. 
  Our core refueling operations are being done in such a 
manner 
to guarantee the technical possibility of later measurement. 
  The fuel rods have been unloaded from the reactor core by 
the 
refueling machine channel by channel, area by area [kuyokpyollo] 
in sequence in the reactor hall, and all the spent fuel rods 
from four channels have been discharged into one basket. 
  Baskets of spent fuel are placed in their own positions of 
the spent fuel tub. 
  All the refueling operations, including recording the 
basket identification number, the channel identification number, 
the sequence of fuel rods in channels, and the position of 
baskets in the tub, are being correctly recorded in accounting 
and operating books [hoegye mit unyong mungon]. 
  Also the identification number of baskets and their 
positions 
in the tub are being strictly ascertained by the agency's 
inspectors now present during the refueling operations. 
  This shows that the refueling operations are now being 
conducted in the presence of IAEA inspectors in such a manner to 
guarantee technical possibilities of their future measurement. 
  So, it is possible to reconstruct the channels of the fuel 
rods in baskets and the sequence of rods in the channels in any 
time if necessary. 
  The channels of fuel rods and the sequence of fuel rods in 
them can be identified by means of the measured value of the 
gamma rays for the fuel rods and the calculated value of the 
distribution of neutron flux along the channels. 
  This method has been fully proven through experiment under 
wet and dry conditions. When this method is applied, the 
working amount of measurement may be slightly larger than that 
by the method of selecting fuel rods in the reactor core. But 
it is the only rational method [yuirhagye hamnijogin pangbop] in 
our present situation. 
  It is a scientific method proposed by the operators in the 
spirit of cooperation, out of the sincere desire to demonstrate 
the transparency of our nuclear activities even in the special 
status. 
  At the consultation held in Pyongyang a few days ago as 
regards the refueling, the head of the IAEA delegation also said 
that the method we proposed was theoretically reasonable 
[ironjoguro tadanghadago hamyonso] and that he would study it 
back at the agency and inform us of the results. 
  Nevertheless, some officials [kyechung] of agency's 
Secretariat hurriedly submitted to the UN Security Council a 
report based on their unilateral, unjust judgment [ilbangjogin 
pudanghan pyongga] that the technical possibility of a future 
measurement of the fuel rods is insufficient [pulchungbun], on 
May 27 when the negotiations were under way, before the 
consultation team arrived in Vienna, not waiting for the results. 
  Since the agency promised us to study our proposal after 
going back to Vienna, it should have given us a scientific and 
technical clarification on it. 
  Meanwhile, the UN Security Council did a very irresponsible 
and unfair thing [simhi muchaegimhagye pyongyonjoguro haengdong 
hayodda] according to a scenario written by some member nations 
beforehand, claiming that the core refueling operation must be 
made in accordance with the demand of the agency and, if not, 
the technical possibility of later measurement of the fuel rods 
might be lost. 
  Such an unjustifiable behavior [pudanghan chosa] of the 
agency Secretariat and the UN Security Council was not merely by 
chance. 
  The agency Secretariat deliberately avoided being present at 
the refueling, ignoring our just proposal for its presence from 
the beginning, and hindered [chijangul chuodda] the normal 
operation of our nuclear facilities. When we were compelled to 
start the refueling operation for technical or safety reasons, 
it charged [sibihae nasodda] that we started the refueling in 
the absence of the agency inspectors. 
  The unjustifiable pressure campaign [pudanghan amnyok 
sodong] 
launched by the IAEA and some member nations of the UN Security 
Council with regard to our core refueling operation bears close 
resemblance to their previous pressure campaign based on the 
results of the inspection in March. 
  It is their trite method to lay deliberately lay obstacles 
in 
the way of the solution to the nuclear problem by unreasonably 
[pudanghagye] taking the issue to the United Nations and 
internationalizing and politicizing it each time some progress 
has been made in its solution by our sincere efforts and 
flexible position [sinchuksong innun ipcang]. 
  Facts clearly show that the agency Secretariat has pursued a 
sinister political purpose [pulsunhan chongchijok mokchogul 
chuguhago ittanungosul] of crushing [apsal] us from the 
beginning according to a ready-made scenario, far from taking a 
stand for a fair solution [kongjonghage haegyol hajanun 
ipchangiragi podanun] to our nuclear issue. 
  If some officials of the IAEA Secretariat declare that the 
technical possibility of the future measurement of the fuel rods 
is gone, we cannot but take a decisive countermeasure [kue 
taeunghan kyolchongjogin chochirul chwihaji anunulsu opke 
doelgosida]. 
  If the agency Secretariat truly wants a solution to our 
nuclear problem, it must not continue expanding its partiality 
[pulgongjongsong] with such unreasonable acts [pudanghan 
haengwi] as hurriedly submitting a report based on a wrong 
judgment [kuruttoen pyongga] to the UN Security Council as it 
did this time, but squarely look at the reality and return to 
its original, fair position befitting an international 
organization.

<F P=106> ["IAEA Secretariat Should Look Squarely at Reality and </F>
Return to Position of Impartiality -- Statement of Spokesman for 
General Department of the Atomic Energy" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
General Department of the Atomic Energy of the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea issued a statement today concerning 
the fact that a spokesman for the Secretariat of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] submitted a wrong 
report on the reactor core refueling operations in the DPRK to 
the UN Security Council and the council subsequently adopted a 
"presidential statement" on it. 
  The statement reads: 
  Recently, the Secretariat of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) submitted to the UN Security Council a wrong 
report related to the core refueling operations at the five 
megawatt experimental nuclear power plant in the DPRK, 
misrepresenting facts as if the method of the core refueling 
operations employed by the DPRK would offer slim technical 
possibility of the later measurement of fuel rods, and the UN 
Security Council, accordingly, adopted posthaste a "presidential 
statement". 
  As is known, our five megawatt experimental nuclear power 
plant had no other choice but to begin the core refuelling 
operations from early May for technical or safety reasons. 
  Since we are in a unique status following the temporary 
suspension of the effectuation of our declared withdrawal from 
the [Nuclear] Non-Proliferation Treaty, we are not under 
obligation to accept routine and ad hoc inspections under the 
safeguards agreement but are obligated only to ensure the 
inspection for the continuity of safeguards knowledge. 
  The selection and securing of some fuel rods requested by 
the 
IAEA with regard to the core refueling operations is activities 
for the verification of the completeness of the initial report. 
In the long run, this activity falls under the category of ad 
hoc inspection. 
  The selection and securing of some fuel rods, therefore, can 
never be allowed before our unique status is removed. 
  But, we are doing the core refueling operations in such a 
manner that we fully preserve technical possibility for later 
measurement of such fuel rods as requested by the agency in 
token of good faith, anticipating a dissolution of our unique 
status. 
  At present, the operations of the core refueling and all the 
fuel in the transfer channel, spent fuel pond and damaged fuel 
dry storage are under strict containment and surveillance by the 
agency. 
  Two surveillance cameras installed by the agency at the 
reactor hall where refueling is going on, are monitoring the 
core area, fuel channels and equipment hatch and movements of 
the refueling machines. And the IAEA spent fuel rod counter 
system with a silicon semi-conductor detector, a fission

installed in the spent fuel discharge channel to constantly 
measure and count the spent fuel rod being discharged into 
baskets. 
  The agency has planted thermoluminescence detectors and 
seals 
in all the channels which may be considered to be diversion 
paths and two surveillance cameras in the building of the spent 
fuel pond, to monitor and control the flow of nuclear material. 
  Notably, at the time of the inspection in May, in order to 
make efficient use of the surveillance devices of the agency 
during the refueling, we provided all the conditions requested 
by it, such as the replacement of computers and their parts in 
the spent fuel rod counter, the installation of uninterruptable 
power supply to the IAEA surveillance devices and lighting 
system for spent fuel pond building. 
  Thus, the non-diversion of nuclear material during the 
refueling, is firmly guaranteed. 
  This is admitted by the inspectors of the agency now 
observing the whole processes of refueling. 
  Our core refueling operations is being done in such a manner 
that we preserve technical possibility of later measurement. 
  The fuel rods have been unloaded from the reactor core by 
the 
refueling machine channel by channel, channel group by channel 
group in sequence in the reactor hall, and all the spent fuel 
rods from four channels have been discharged into one basket. 
  Baskets of spent fuel are placed in their own positions of 
the spent fuel pond. 
  Accounting and operating records concerning all the 
operation 
of refueling, including the basket identification number, the 
channel identification number, the sequence of fuel rods in 
channels, and the position of baskets in the pond, are being 
kept at facility. 
  Also the identification number of baskets and their 
positions 
in the pond are being strictly ascertained by the agency's 
inspectors now present during the operation of refueling. 
  This shows that the refueling operations are now being 
conducted in the presence of IAEA inspectors in such a manner 
that we preserve technical possibilities of their future 
measurement. 
  So, it is possible to reconstruct the channels of the fuel 
rods in baskets and the sequence of rods in the channels in any 
time if necessary. 
  The channels of fuel rods and the sequence of fuel rods in 
them can be identified by means of the measured value of the 
gamma rays for the fuel rods and the calculated value of the 
distribution of neutron flux along the channels. 
  This method has been fully proved through experiment under 
wet and dry conditions. When this method is applied, the 
working amount of measurement may slightly be larger than that 
by the method of selecting fuel rods in the reactor core. But 
it is the only rational method in our present situation. 
  It is a scientific method proposed by the operators in the 
spirit of cooperation, out of the sincere desire to demonstrate 
the transparency of our nuclear activities. 
  At the consultation held in Pyongyang a few days ago as 
regards the refueling, the head of the IAEA delegation, too, 
said that the DPRK-proposed method was reasonable from the 
theoretical point of view and that he would study it back at the 
agency, and inform us of the results. 
  This notwithstanding, some officials of the IAEA Secretariat 
hurriedly submitted to the United Nations Security Council a 
report based on their unilateral, wrong judgement that the 
technical possibility of a future measurement of the fuel rods 
is insufficient, on May 27 when the negotiations were under way, 
before the consultation team arrived in Vienna, not waiting for 
the results. 
  Since the agency promised us to study our proposal after 
going back to Vienna, it should have given us a scientific and 
technical clarification. 
  Meanwhile, the United Nations Security Council did a very 
irresponsible and unfair act according to a scenario written by 
some member nations beforehand, claiming that the core refueling 
operation must be made in accordance with the standards of the 
agency and, if not, the technical possibility of later 
measurement of the fuel rods might be lost. 
  Such an unjustifiable behavior of the agency Secretariat and 
the UN Security Council was by no means fortuitous. 
  The agency Secretariat deliberately avoided presence at the 
refueling ignoring our just proposal for its presence from the 
beginning, and hindered the normal operation of our nuclear 
facilities. 
  When we were compelled to start the refueling operation for 
technical or safety reasons, it charged that we started the 
refueling in the absence of its inspectors. 
  The unjustifiable pressure campaign launched against us by 
the IAEA and some member nations of the UN Security Council with 
regard to the core refueling operation in our country bears 
close resemblance to the previous pressure campaign based on the 
results of the inspection in March. 
  It is their trite method to lay deliberate obstacles in the 
way of the solution to the nuclear issue by unreasonably taking 
the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK to the United Nations and 
internationalizing and politicizing it each time some progress 
was made in its solution by the DPRK's sincere efforts and 
flexible position. 
  Facts clearly indicate that the agency Secretariat has 
pursued a sinister political purpose of stifling the DPRK from 
the beginning according to a ready-made scenario, far from 
taking a stand for a solution to the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. 
  If some officials of the agency Secretariat declare that the 
technical possibility of the future measurement of the fuel rods 
is gone, we cannot but take a decisive countermeasure. 
  If the IAEA Secretariat truly want a solution to the 
"nuclear 
issue" of the DPRK, it must not continue expanding its 
partiality with such unreasonable acts as hurriedly submitting a 
report based on a wrong judgement to the UN Security Council as 
it did this time, but squarely look at the situation and return 
to its original, fair position befitting an international 
organization.

<F P=106> ["IAEA Must Take Measure for Strict Inspection of All </F>
Nuclear Facilities of Japan" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the 
General Department of the Atomic Energy of the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea on Friday answered a question put by 
KCNA on the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] is defending the concealment of plutonium by Japan. 
  The spokesman said: 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency recently published a 
communique to the effect that it did not call in question the 
discovery of a large amount of unaccounted-for plutonium in 
Japan. This fully reveals the partiality and irresponsibility of 
the agency. 
  The agency claims that it had known the accumulation of a 
fabulous amount of plutonium "in the form of dust and waste" at 
the tokaimura nuclear fuel-making plant of Japan. But facts 
clearly prove that it had been in the dark about it in actuality. 
  According to a media report, when the South Korean 
authorities requested the clarification of the background of the 
discovery of the unaccounted-for plutonium in Japan on May 12, 
Japan herself admitted that 70 kg of unaccounted-for plutonium 
had been discovered at the Tokaimura nuclear fuel-making plant. 
  The donen (the power reactor and nuclear fuel development 
business), the operator of the Tokaimura plant, informed the 
ITAR- TASS on May 10 that the plutonium in question was 
discovered in April by inspectors of the agency during their 
scheduled inspection of the plant. 
  The Japanese paper JAPAN TIMES said the agency would have 
never known that hidden raw material was being prepared in Japan 
for nuclear bombs, unless a secret report of the U.S. Nuclear 
Control Institute tipped it off about that. 
  The director of the U.S. Nuclear Control Institute pointed 
out in a more explicit term that though high-tech facilities 
supervising the amount of remaining plutonium are installed in 
the plant, the inaccuracy of measurement is high and the amount 
of plutonium that might be accumulated in that course is 
fabulous and, in view of this, the agency cannot confidently 
declare that plutonium enough to make one or more nuclear bombs 
has not been diverted from the plant and the problem is that the 
agency's safeguards cannot detect the possible crafty divergence 
of plutonium at the nuclear fuel plant. 
  Nevertheless, the agency, without so much as a proper 
explanation about the case, claims that it had known of the 
plutonium in question at the Tokaimura plant and it is now under 
its safeguards. We are quite surprised at this absurd claim. 
  While maximizing and taking issue with a tiny amount of 
reported plutonium of the DPRK which was extracted for 
experimental purpose, the agency is zealously defending the 
ridiculous amount of unreported plutonium of Japan which is 
undeniably high in the possibility of diversion and, ignoring 
the demand of the world community for the clarification of the 
truth, refuted it off-hand with a sheet of communique. This 
irresponsible act has brought into bolder relief the partiality 
of the agency and its application of a double standard and makes 
us feel a stronger doubt as to its mission and credibility. 
  By defending the case, the agency itself has, after all, 
given the strong impression that its inspection depends on 
political considerations. 
  Since the case occurred when Japan has not definitely 
renounced its excessive stockpile of plutonium and, worse still, 
her nuclear armament has reached a practical danger line, the 
agency, true to its mission, must call it in question and 
discuss it at the board of governors and take a measure for an 
overall and strict inspection of all the facilities of Japan, 
thus dispelling the serious concern of the world community over 
the nuclear armament of Japan and her conversion into a military 
power. 
  We will follow the move of the agency.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk interspersed with music: "National Glory </F>
and Korea's Dignity"] 
  [Text] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: In 
our country at the moment, the work of the party, the state, and 
the military is being well carried out, and the socialist 
construction is being successfully implemented under the 
leadership of Comrade Kim Chong-il. [music] Mt. Paektu forests, 
endlessly throb! The whole land of Korea, let us shout cheers! 
Sun of guidance, shine in glory! Comrade Kim Chong-il held in 
high esteem by people! [music] 
  This song is being sung by our people with heart, filled 
with 
endless dignity and joy! The song, which each of our people is 
singing, overflowing with great dignity and joy of holding the 
dear comrade leader in high esteem at the head of our party and 
revolution [uridanggua hyongmyongui suwie nopi mosin], is 
reverberating throughout rivers and mountains. [music] 
  The new era of history is advanced and brightened by the 
great leader [yongdoja]. For a country, for a nation, there is 
no other greater fortune than holding in high esteem such a 
leader [yongdoja], (?at the head of the era), as the one who is 
great in idea and philosophy, outstanding in the leadership 
quality and capability, and sacred in personality. 
  Our people are holding in esteem the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, the fate of the nation and the glory of the world, as 
the great leader [yongdoja] of our era! We recall the bygone 
days, unable to suppress the gushing forth of the boundless 
national dignity and pride of holding two great leaders 
[yongdoja], the most outstanding great men, in one generation. 
[music] 
  One summer, the dear comrade leader took a walk for a while, 
attending upon the great leader [suryongnim]. The Workers 
Party of Korea [WPK] flag was vigorously flying at the roof of 
the party Central Committee building with the twilight of the 
setting sun. Our party flag has truly profound stories and a 
sacred history. 
  The respected and beloved leader looked for a long time at 
the party flag flying up high in the sky . With the tone of 
deep emotion, he said: Time really flies. It is already nearly 
40 years since we upheld the banner of the Korean revolution. He 
recollected the unforgettable past when he pledged, in front of 
the red banner of revolution, to fight with life for the 
realization of the program for Down With Imperialism Union while 
putting forth that program's proposal for building a socialist, 
communist society in our country. 
  His retrospective remarks, which began with his 
recollections 
of the bygone days of the Korean revolution when he pulled up 
the anchor along the sea route of independence in the beginning 
of the 20th century, extended to today and the future. 
  The meaningful remarks were made by the respected and 
beloved 
leader who said: The way to the revolution is still long and 
rough. The vast future requires great efforts. Reflected in the 
remarks were his profound intentions and great expectations to 
see his pledge, which he had made in the days of history, surely 
materialized in this land. 
  This was really an emotion-evoking scene which was recorded 
in the history of the Korean revolution. 
  One day after that day, the dear comrade leader met with 
responsible functionaries of the party Central Committee. That 
day, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il gave precious 
teachings about well carrying out their work by well upholding 
the great leader. He continued to say: The cause of the 
revolution we are carrying out is the one that the leader 
[suryongnim] had pioneered. Our revolutionary cause is the 
rewarding one that had begun in Mt. Paektu. In other words, 
that is our party's sacred cause for communist construction 
which has recorded its first glorious trace in the history since 
the program of Down With Imperialism Union was put forth. 
  This remark by the dear comrade leader which involves the 
deep meaning of the beginning and future of our revolution was a 
great declaration to bring a great golden age in the socialist 
cause to this land by going across the past generations with his 
extraordinary ideological and theoretical wisdom, excellent 
leadership ability, and iron-like will and courage. [music] 
  The WPK has been firmly united and consolidated as one mind 
under the slogan of modeling the whole party after the chuche 
idea! The socialist system of our own style under which the 
principle of independence in politics, self-reliance in the 
economy, and self-defending in national defense has been 
realized and all the people have become a large revolutionary 
family! The revolutionary people who are firmly united with 
loyalty and filial piety around their leader [yongdoja], while 
regarding the chuche idea and socialism as their lives and 
living! The matchless strong Army which has become an invincible 
army under the banner of modeling the entire army after the 
chuche idea! 
  From these excited events which lead us to be optimistic 
about the future of mankind not only in the present century, but 
also in the 21st century; from the amazing changes and 
transformations which are being created; and in the noble 
appearance of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il who has 
brilliant wisdom, matchless courage, tested leadership ability, 
and extraordinary organizational ability our people and all of 
mankind are witnessing the appearance of the great leader 
[widaehan yongdoja] of the 21st century, a new era of history. 
  The 21st century will be more bright and prosperous in the 
future! Our people are indeed the happy people who live and work 
with high ideal and with a firm belief in the future, upholding 
the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the great leader. 
  The animated and dignified chuche socialist Korea which is 
upholding as the great leader Comrade Kim Chong-chol who, taking 
upon himself the bright future of Korea and the destiny of 
socialism, is leading history to vigorously advance toward the 
21st century along the route of independence! 
  Ogami Kenichi, director of the Secretariat of the 
International Institute of the Chuche Idea, in his article 
entitled "The Great Leader [widaehan yongdoja] Leading the 21st 
Century," admired the dear comrade leader as follows: The world 
will enter, under Secretary Kim Chong-il's guidance, a new era 
in which the chuche idea is extensively embodied and brought 
into full bloom. Without learning from Secretary Kim Chong-il it 
is impossible to look ahead to the new era of mankind. 
  Yes, it is true. There is no people in this world who are 
happier than our people who are struggling to consummate the 
socialist cause, upholding Comrade Kim Chong-il as the great 
leader. This is precisely our people's glory and Korea's pride. 
This glory of our people and this pride of chuche Korea are 
echoing rivers and mountains as a great song. [music]

  [Text] Aizu-Wakamatsu, Fukushima Pref., June 4 KYODO -- 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata vowed Saturday to bolster Japan's 
preparedness to deal with any contingency that may derive from a 
standoff over the suspected North Korean nuclear arms program. 
  "Generally speaking, it is proper for a nation to arrange 
preparedness that would enable it to cope with any development," 
Hata said at a news conference. 
  Hata was speaking about Japan's response to a possible 
contingency on the Korean peninsula amid heightened tension from 
the announcement Friday by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) that it can no longer verify if Pyongyang diverted 
plutonium for nuclear arms production. 
  Hata earlier said Japan would join U.N.-led sanctions 
against 
North Korea if the Security Council voted to approve punitive 
steps, while making it clear that Japan would keep open the 
option of acting with the United States and South Korea in 
slapping sanctions even without such a U.N. decision. 
  The U.N. nuclear watchdog said Friday the North Korean 
discharge of spent fuel rods from a nuclear reactor has made it 
impossible to ascertain whether North Korea diverted plutonium 
from the reactor in the past. 
  "I am monitoring how North Korea would respond to a 
statement 
by the president of U.N. Security Council that urged it to 
comply with the safeguards measures demanded by the IAEA," Hata 
said. 
  "I want North Korea to accept international public opinion 
and open up their heart (to the inspection demand)," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 5 KYODO -- Topics on the agenda at the 
Group of Seven (G-7) summit of industrialized nations include 
situations in the former Yugoslavia and the Middle East, 
assistance needs of South Africa and Ukraine and the North 
Korean nuclear issue, government sources said Sunday. 
  Representatives of the G-7 nations -- Britain, Canada, 
France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- worked 
out an agenda of political dialogue for the July 8-10 meeting in 
Naples, Italy, the sources said. 
  Unlike previous G-7 summits, they said, the Naples summit 
will not issue a political declaration. 
  Instead, they will merely issue a chairman's declaration, in 
view of Russia's formal participation for the first time. 
  At previous summits, Kremlin leaders were invited to join 
their G-7 counterparts for a special session outside the 
framework of the actual summit. 
  Russia's participation in the G-7 discussion on the former 
Yugoslavia will be especially meaningful, considering the 
country's influence over fellow Slavs in Serbia. 
  The sources said Japan, which has not sent personnel to join 
the United Nations Protection Force (Unprofor) in the former 
Yugoslavia, will call for continued efforts to keep the conflict 
in Bosnia- Herzegovina from spreading. 
  Japan will convey its resolve to extend assistance to 
surrounding countries such as Macedonia to consolidate stability 
there, as well as post-conflict reconstruction assistance to 
other parts of the former Yugoslavia, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa pledged Japanese cooperation Friday [3 June] if the 
United Nations decides to impose sanctions on North Korea for 
the country's continued refusal to allow international 
inspections at its nuclear facilities. 
  "Should United Nations measures be decided, it is desirable 
that Japan cooperate in these," Kakizawa said in answering a 
question from a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) legislator in the 
House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee. In case the 
UN Security Council cannot reach agreement over the sanctions 
issue due to anticipated opposition from China, North Korea's 
traditional ally which favors a soft approach in the nuclear 
controversy, Japan would offer "maximum cooperation" in 
multilateral punitive measures, he said. Japan could do its 
part by halting cash remittances to North Korea from 
pro-Pyongyang organizations and residents in Japan and 
suspending trade with the communist country, Kakizawa said. 
  Taking into account that the situation on the Korean 
peninsula is Japan's direct security interest, Tokyo's "basic 
foreign policy stance" is to do its utmost to support Washington 
should it decide to move independently from the UN, he said. He 
said, however, such U.S. measures would have to be "effective" 
to gain Tokyo's approval. Kakizawa also stressed that without 
winning China's support the UN Security council would not be 
able to exert any pressure on North Korea to accept the 
international calls for inspections. 
  In response to another question from the opposition LDP, 
Kakizawa said Japan would resume normalization talks with North 
Korea as soon as possible if Pyongyang "displays a sincere 
attitude toward dispelling suspicions that it is developing 
nuclear weapons." Asked for an assessment of U.S. moves toward 
sanctions, Yutaka Kawashima, director general of the Foreign 
Ministry's Asia Affairs Bureau, said "there are various 
opinions" within U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration 
and no unified stance has been formulated yet. "There are calls 
for sanctions as anger has built up after one year of endurance" 
in the nuclear controversy, he said, adding "the American 
Government's stance has not hardened yet." 
  Following a regular cabinet meeting in the morning, chief 
Government Spokesman Hiroshi Kumagai reiterated Tokyo's concern 
over North Korea's defiance of the inspection demands. "We are 
deeply concerned about this situation," Kumagai told a news 
conference. "We would like to weigh what action to take in close 
concert with the countries involved such as the United States, 
South Korea and China," he said. 
  Kumagai later said before a lower house panel, "we have no 
specific sanctions in mind. We will tenaciously try to 
persuade" North Korea to reach a negotiated settlement of the 
nuclear row. 
  On Thursday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
informed the UN Security Council that Pyongyang's refusal to let 
inspectors conduct an unimpeded check of discharged fuel rods 
has made it impossible to verify whether plutonium has been 
diverted in the past to manufacture atomic bombs. North Korea 
last month started to exchange without IAEA supervision the 
8,000 fuel rods in its 5-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon, sparking 
another security council statement last week urging compliance 
with the agency's inspection demands.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Government sources confirmed 
Friday that North Korea tested a second antiship cruise missile 
over the Sea of Japan this week. 
  The sources said North Korea apparently test-fired the 
second 
modified Chinese "Silkworm" missile around Thursday [2 June]. 
The missile was fired from the North Korean east coast toward 
the Sea of Japan. 
  North Korea launched a similar "Silkworm" missile in the Sea 
of Japan on Tuesday. 
  The sources said the aim of the test was not clear, but 
added 
that it probably has little political significance since such 
tests are often conducted in close succession. 
  The sources said the government is also closely monitoring 
North Korean preparations for medium-range ballistic missile 
tests.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- The International 
Liaison Committee for the Reunification and Peace in Korea 
(Cilreco) in the "Memorandum on the Nuclear Issue of the Korean 
Peninsula" published on May 11 cited concrete data to refute the 
false argument of the United States and its allies about 
"nuclear threat" from the Northern half of Korea and laid bare 
the truth behind it. 
  The lengthy memorandum is made up of the foreword, 
concluding 
words and "1. The origin of the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula and U.S. nuclear weapons deployed in South Korea," 
"2. The United States' deployment of nuclear weapons in South 
Korea is the dangerous source of nuclear war," "3. The 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is taking the attitude 
of discriminating against the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea. U.S. interference and intrigues with IAEA are a gross 
discredit to the IAEA," "4. Attempt to impose `sanctions' upon 
DPRK through the U.N. Security Council is a breach of the U.N. 
Charter and meant to use the international community as a tool 
of the United States for executing its policy of strength," "5. 
The U.S. alleged 'nuclear threat' from the North is a new 
excuse based on the fiction of `threat of southward invasion' 
from the North," "6. In order to achieve a peaceful 
reunification of the Korean peninsula without foreign 
interference, an environment favorable for a solution to all 
conflicts in the region should be created and the confederation 
formula laid down by the DPRK be realized." 
  The memorandum says the aim sought by the United States and 
its allies against the DPRK, raising a hue and cry over the 
fictitious "nuclear issue" of the North is to perpetuate the 
existence of nuclear weapons worldwide and push ahead with their 
modernization and ensure continued monopolization of nuclear 
weapons by big powers, and to draw public attention away from 
the U.S. nuclear weapons deployed in South Korea on the pretext 
of the "Korean issue". 
  According to the memorandum, the United States began 
shipping 
nuclear weapons into the Korean peninsula in 1957 in violation 
of the Armistice Agreement and turned South Korea into a vast 
nuclear base from the mid-1970s. 
  The fact that nuclear weapons were deployed in South Korea 
was confirmed officially when it was made public at the 125th 
session of the South Korean "National Assembly" in 1985 that the 
number of various types of nukes deployed in South Korea reached 
1,720. 
  The DPRK, a non-nuclear state, in its government statement 
June 23, 1986, proposed to the United States and South Korea to 
turn the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free peace zone, and 
urged the United States to reduce the nuclear weapons in South 
Korea on a phased basis for the complete withdrawal of the 
nuclear weapons therefrom and to cancel all its operational 
plans. 
  The United States, together with South Korea, is conducting 
a 
campaign against the North over its "nuclear arms development". 
  The DPRK advanced new detailed proposals, paying heed to the 
"declaration on denuclearization" of the then South Korean 
"President" No Tae-u November 8, 1991 and, as a result, the 
"joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula" was adopted. 
  The DPRK concluded with the IAEA the safeguards agreement 
pursuant to the [Nuclear] Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) on 
January 30, 1992 and accepted the agency's five consecutive 
inspections of its facilities. 
  The IAEA, however, under pressure from the United States, 
has 
further spread the "nuclear suspicion" about the North, trying 
to force a "special inspection" of military sites of the DPRK. 
  The IAEA's unreasonable demand for a "special inspection" of 
military sites of a sovereign state contravenes the principles 
of neutrality and impartiality of the agency. 
  The unfair attitude of the IAEA is manifested in the fact 
that pressure has not been put on the countries whose production 
and stockpile of nuclear weapons are kept secret. 
  Japan has promoted its nuclear program from long ago, and 
South Korea has stockpiled above ten tons of plutonium enough to 
manufacture 1,500 Nagasaki-type nuclear bombs. 
  While negotiating with the North, the United States has made 
the U.N. Security Council put pressure on it. 
  If the United Nations truly wants a fair solution of Korea's 
"nuclear issue", it must take measures to get all the foreign 
forces out of South Korea, dissolve the "U.N. Command" and to 
help realize the principles of independent and peaceful 
reunification of Korea, as clarified in the resolution adopted 
at the 30th session of the U.N. General Assembly in 1975. 
  The North's "nuclear threat" clamored about by the United 
States and the successive South Korean authorities is nothing 
more than a sophism invented to justify the U.S. military 
occupation of South Korea and the deployment and reinforcement 
of its military equipment and "protect" South Korea under its 
"nuclear umbrella". 
  The June 11, 1993, DPRK-U.S. joint statement supported the 
North-South joint declaration on denuclearization, and it 
declared that Armed Forces including nuclear weapons shall not 
be used, threat not be made with such forces and the 
denuclearization, peace and security of the Korean peninsula be 
ensured and each other's sovereignty shall be respected 
mutually. It also expressed support to Korea's peaceful 
reunification. 
  Nevertheless, the United States again launched into a 
campaign against the DPRK, expressing its intention to resume 
the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises, and the U.S. 
President blared that any North Korean attack on South Korea 
would be regarded as an attack on the United States. 
  The agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. New York 
contact for a negotiated solution of the problem was published 
on February 25, 1994, but the United States negated the agreed 
conclusions by threatening to resume the "Team Spirit" joint 
military exercises and not to come out to the third round talks 
but take the North's "nuclear issue" again to the U.N. Security 
Council. 
  The deployment by U.S. war-thirsty elements of 192 Patriot 
missiles and 84 ground-to-air Stinger missiles in South Korea in 
April this year has caused apprehensions of the entire Korean 
people in the North and the South and touched off ceaseless 
demonstrations in South Korea against the United States' 
escalated arms buildup. 
  The open deployment of latest-type weapons in South Korea is 
a crude violation of the Armistice Agreement. 
  The United Nations, with heavy responsibility for ensuring 
peace on the Korean peninsula, should discharge its role and 
duty. 
  To this end, the unstable Armistice Agreement signed in 1953 
should be replaced by a peace agreement in accordance with the 
resolution of the 30th session of the U.N. General Assembly. 
  The confederacy formula laid down by President Kim Il-song 
of 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a realistic and 
fair one which makes it possible to achieve Korea's 
reunification under the conditions where two different systems 
exist in the North and the South. 
  To achieve the national reunification is the aspiration and 
legitimate right of the entire Korean people. 
  It is also an important factor for the elimination of 
nuclear 
weapons, for the security in this region and the security and 
peace of the world people. 
  The memorandum stresses that the international community 
should call for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and 
that the United States must not use such international 
organizations as the U.N. Security Council and the IAEA to 
gratify its interests but respect the joint statement adopted 
with the DPRK, resume negotiations with it and thereby create 
favorable conditions for peace and detente.

<F P=106> ["Should the United States Choose Strong Arm, Our Option Will </F>
Change, Declares Head of DPRK Delegation to DPRK-U.S. Talks" -- 
KCNA 
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- Kang Sok-chu, first 
vice-minister of foreign affairs and head of the DPRK delegation 
to the DPRK-U.S. talks, published a statement on Friday on the 
lapse of one year since the publication of the DPRK-U.S. joint 
statement. 
  He said: 
  It is one year since the DPRK-U.S. joint statement was 
published. 
  The joint statement was the first of its kind in the history 
of the DPRK-U.S. relations in which the sides promised each 
other the ban on the use of Armed Forces including nuclear 
weapons and threat with them, mutual respect of sovereignty and 
non-interference in each other's internal affairs. It was of 
weighty importance in that it laid the foundation of the 
DPRK-U.S. talks for a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula and a practical end to the hostile 
relations between the two countries. 
  Looking back on the past one year, however, we must note 
with 
regret that the principles of the joint statement have not been 
observed. 
  As everyone knows, with the publication of the joint 
statement, we temporarily suspended the effectuation of our 
declared withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 
[NPT] and, even with this unique status, we accepted on the 
highest level the inspection of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency for the continuity of safeguards. 
  And, fully considerate of the apprehensions of the United 
States, we promoted with sincerity the working-level contacts 
for the exchange of special envoys between the North and the 
South and even made a momentous decision to replace the graphite 
moderated reactor system with a light water reactor system at 
the sacrifice of the independence of our nuclear power industry. 
  The package solution to the nuclear issue which we were to 
propose at the third-round talks included all the questions in 
which the United States might be interested, such as the 
resumption of the routine and ad hoc inspections of the agency 
pursuant to the safeguards agreement, our return to the NPT and 
the dismantling of the radiochemical laboratory with the 
replacement of the graphite moderated reactor with the light 
water reactor. 
  We do not intend to drive a bargain with the United States 
over the nuclear issue or get something from it in this 
connection. All we want is an end to the U.S. policy of 
nuclear threat to us and the removal of the hostile relations 
between us and the United States and the abnormal relations 
between us and the agency. 
  Only then can the nuclear issue be fundamentally resolved 
and 
thus peace be consolidated on the Korean peninsula and, 
furthermore, security be ensured in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  The United States, however, failed to give any practical 
assurances that it would renounce its policy of nuclear threat 
and stifling against us and, while using the phraseology of 
DPRK-U.S. talks, refused even to sit down at the negotiating 
table with us, leading the talks to a collapse in actuality. So 
we have not had even an opportunity to discuss the package 
solution with the United States. 
  The past one year since the publication of the DPRK-U.S. 
joint statement has been, in the final analysis, a period in 
which the United States has not sought a solution to the problem 
through the talks but, on the contrary, used the signboard of 
the talks as a tool of pressure and a means of trick against us, 
according to the reversed mode of thinking that it would come to 
the talks when the problem is solved, and a period in which it 
forced South Korea to open its rice and arms markets over the 
nuclear issue and pursued only its selfish aim. 
  It is not difficult to see the motive of the start of the 
U.S.- orchestrated anti-DPRK pressure campaign over the core 
refueling at our experimental atomic power plant. 
  Core refueling is an indispensable normal process of the 
operation of an atomic power plant. Furthermore, as we have 
declared, we have taken measures to fully preserve the technical 
possibility of ad hoc inspection of the fuel rods when our 
unique status will have been removed as expected and we firmly 
ensure the non-diversion of the spent fuel rods. 
  Despite our well-intentioned step, however, some officials 
of 
the IAEA Secretariat "concluded" that the possibility of later 
measurement of fuel rods was lost. The Secretariat may give up 
measurement, if it does not want it. 
  For our part, we preserve the scientific and technical 
possibility of it. So, if the nuclear issue is solved between 
our country and the United States, not only the measurement of 
fuel rods but even more complicated problems than that would be 
solved without difficulty. 
  The honesty of our nuclear activities in the past could be 
seen clearly in the well-meant step of allowing an "additional 
inspection" of the radiochemical laboratory. 
  This notwithstanding, they tried to find fault with the core 
refueling, saying the possibility of measurement was lost. This 
is an insidious attempt to call in question our graphite 
moderated reactor system now in operation and put the brakes on 
the development of our existing nuclear energy industry as a 
whole, not to inquire into our nuclear activities in the past. 
In the final analysis, this cannot be construed otherwise than 
part of their political plot to stifle our system. 
  This is borne out by such ill-boding moves within the United 
States of late as open calls for "UN sanctions", "multinational 
sanctions" and "preemptive strike" at peaceful nuclear 
facilities of the DPRK. 
  Should the United States thus totally give up even the 
DPRK-USA talks now, we would be left with no other choice but to 
conclude that our efforts for a diplomatic solution have failed. 
  If the United States is willing to have the talks now, our 
proposal for a package solution is still valid. But, if it 
chooses a strongarm measure, our option too will change. We 
will go over to the next process of our nuclear activities and 
cannot but expand our independent atomic energy industry by the 
present method. 
  In case the United States declares the foundation of the 
DPRK-USA talks has been destroyed, the foundation on which we 
have temporarily suspended the effectuation of our declared 
withdrawal from the non-proliferation treaty will collapse. 
  We have already notified the parties concerned that 
"economic 
sanctions" would be regarded as a declaration of war against us. 
  In this case, not only the parties joining in the 
"sanctions" 
against our Republic but also those backing such "sanctions" 
will be held responsible. 
  This is not what we want. 
  The United States must not take our patience for a sign of 
weakness.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
mobilized nuclear-capable F-16 and F-15 fighter-bombers, 
pursuit-assault planes, VTOL [vertical takeoff and landing] 
assault planes, electronic jamming planes and early warning 
planes based overseas and warplanes of the U.S. Airforce 
stationed in South Korea and the South Korean puppet Airforce, 
some 500 in all, in surprise air strike exercises against the 
North in the skies above Yongwol, Tanyang, Umsong and Asan Bay 
of South Korea on June 1 and 2, according to military sources. 
  Meanwhile, the South Korean puppets fired more than 500 
large-calibre machinegun and automatic rifle bullets, charging 
toward the Military Demarcation Line from Paju County on June 1. 
Formations of helicopter gunboats and transport helicopters 
staged ground-attack support and airlifting exercises in the 
skies above Pochon, Yonchon and Chorwon and Inje, South Korean 
Kangwon Province, on June 2. 
  Facts clearly show how desperately the U.S. imperialists and 
the South Korean puppets are trying to increase their combat 
capacity in a war against the North.

  [Text] Japan, the United States, and South Korea have 
agreed in principle to "take appropriate measures including 
economic sanctions against North Korea in the UN Security 
Council" for its suspected development of nuclear weapons. In 
response, the government highly assessed the agreement on 5 
June, saying, "Japan, the United States, and South Korea have 
been able to show their cohesiveness," (according to a Foreign 
Ministry source). The idea surfaced in response to Japan's 
insistence that the UN Security Council adopt a "resolution 
warning North Korea," and the government plans to speedily study 
from early next week the possibility of including an embargo on 
the export of weapons to North Korea in the resolution. While 
the United States, Britain, and other nations are taking a tough 
stand, China is still cautious about any economic sanctions 
against North Korea. Japan, therefore, is likely to be pressed 
to conduct difficult coordination. 
  The government will start a full-fledged study of measures 
to 
be taken by Japan after Shunji Yanai, chief of the Foreign 
Policy Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, who attended the 
tripartite talks, returns to Japan on 6 June. The government 
will hold a meeting of the "Joint Information Council" on 6 June 
that is to be attended by officials from relevant ministries and 
agencies, and chaired by Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobuo 
Ishihara. With regard to the "resolution warning North Korea" 
and other sanctions that were discussed at the tripartite talks, 
the government sees the resolution as "a highly possible 
option," (according to an informed source). 
  The Japanese Government has adopted a basic policy for 
"phased sanctions against North Korea" under which 1) the UN 
Security Council first adopts the "resolution warning North 
Korea"; 2) in case North Korea refuses to go along with the 
resolution, then the UN Security Council "votes to slap the 
economic sanctions on North Korea"; and 3) in case China opposes 
the economic sanctions, then Japan, the United States, and South 
Korea impose their own economic sanctions against North Korea. 
The Japanese Government has adopted this basic policy, taking 
into account the situation where China is expressing its 
disapproval of the economic sanctions against North Korea, and 
the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is opposing any 
economic sanctions imposed jointly by Japan, the United States, 
and South Korea as long as the UN Security Council does not vote 
to impose such economic sanctions. 
  The export embargo of weapons and materials used to build 
nuclear weapons to North Korea is included in measures that the 
government believes Japan can take. The government believes 
that since such weapons and materials are not actually exported 
to North Korea, Japan's proposal for the export embargo will be 
accepted by other nations (according to a government source). 
The proposal is the product of a compromise between the United 
States, that has advocated imposing tough economic sanctions 
against North Korea from the beginning, and Japan and South 
Korea that have been negative about imposing the economic 
sanctions. As a result, the proposal has saved the face of the 
United States. The effect of the economic sanctions is believed 
to be slim. Therefore, there is a high possibility that the 
United States, Britain, and France will demand tougher economic 
sanctions against North Korea. 
  The question remains whether China will really go along with 
Japan on the proposal for imposing the export embargo of weapons 
to North Korea. While some government officials take an 
optimistic view that China will accept the proposal in the end, 
other government officials take the pessimistic view that China 
will resist the proposal to the last. The government intends to 
do everything it can in concert with the United States to 
persuade China.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "North Korea Needs To Show Its Sincerity"] </F>
  [Text] The situation continues to worsen regarding the 
issue of the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected development of 
nuclear weapons. Assistant Secretary of State Robert L. 
Gallucci, who twice represented the U.S. side in the U.S.-DPRK 
high-level talks last year, declared: "There are no longer any 
grounds on which to hold the third round of high-level talks." 
  Kang Sok-chu, DPRK first vice minister of foreign affairs, 
who represented the DPRK in the high-level talks, earlier said: 
"If the United States declares the foundation of the DPRK-U.S. 
talks has been destroyed, the foundation on which we have 
temporarily suspended the effectuation of our declared 
withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) will 
collapse." In this way, Kang hinted at formal DPRK withdrawal 
from the NPT. However, Gallucci said: "The United States and 
the international community will not stand for any threats from 
North Korea." He thus indicated the United States does not 
intend to back off at all. 
  We have insisted that to completely settle the North Korean 
nuclear issue, the third round of high-level U.S.-DPRK talks 
should be held without any preconditions attached. According to 
bilateral accords reached last summer, the United States and 
North Korea are supposed to hold the third round of talks to 
discuss such issues as North Korea's official return to the NPT, 
special inspection of the DPRK's two undeclared nuclear 
facilities, and the replacement of North Korea's graphite 
moderated reactor to the light water reactor, which has a low 
plutonium conversion ratio. These issues are to be broadly 
discussed along with other problems such as the improvement of 
political and economic relations between the two nations. 
  Originally, the United States had planned to hold the third 
round of talks with North Korea in early June, after holding 
discussions with Japan and the ROK. In the end, this plan 
failed to materialize, as the DPRK refused to comply with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) request to follow 
its regulations regarding separating and storing spent nuclear 
fuel rods in the process of refueling North Korea's 
5,000-kilowatt experimental nuclear reactor. 
  It is a mystery as to why North Korea refused to cooperate 
with the IAEA. The nuclear watchdog organization had in fact 
given consideration to North Korea for its "unique status" and 
made concessions, agreeing to analyze the fuel rods "in the 
future" rather than "at the present." 
  A senior U.S. Government official has said that the issues 
of 
DPRK missiles exports and human rights are to be taken up at the 
third round of talks with North Korea. Perhaps North Korea felt 
that it needed a new negotiating card in response to U.S. plans 
to take up the human rights issue in the third round of 
bilateral talks. 
  In the United States, however, more and more Government 
officials and Congressmen became irritated with Gallucci's 
policy of trying to settle the DPRK nuclear issue through 
dialogue. Finally, the United States has become enraged with 
the fuel rods issue. 
  Regardless of the DPRK's intention, high-level talks between 
the United States and North Korea remains the most realistic way 
to settle the nuclear issue. However, the U.S. assistant 
secretary of state, who ardently insisted on settling the issue 
through dialogue, has been forced to declare "suspension of the 
third round of talks." Considering such a political situation in 
the United States, the only way to break the currently 
deadlocked situation is for North Korea to take a sincere 
attitude regarding the issue of the removal of its spent nuclear 
fuel rods. 
  Although North Korea has asserted that "fuel rod samples can 
be analyzed in the future according to the way we proposed," the 
IAEA is not convinced. The IAEA has made concessions regarding 
when fuel rod samples would be analyzed. Now, it is North 
Korea's turn to make concessions to open the third round of 
talks. 
  Not only will imposing economic sanctions against North 
Korea 
fail to solve the nuclear issue, but it could also deal a 
serious blow to the NPT framework. Considering that North Korea 
is being pushed into a corner, there is even a possibility that 
military tension might develop as a result of economic sanctions. 
  It will require a lot of time for the UN Security Council to 
discuss economic sanctions. Moreover, its is expected that in 
the end, the PRC will exercise its veto power. For this reason, 
the Japanese Government is considering joining the U.S. and ROK 
Governments toward imposing multilateral sanctions against North 
Korea, outside of the UN framework. However, we urge that the 
government exercise caution. It is necessary to continue 
striving to settle the issue through dialogue, at all costs, 
with both the PRC and Russia, which border the Korean peninsula, 
participating in the discussions.

Shigeru Handa: "Behind-the-Scene Story of Rimpac `94 -- 
Japan-U.S.- ROK Team Intended for Emergency on Korean 
Peninsula?"] 
  [Text] On 31 May, nine destroyers of the Maritime 
Self-Defense Force [MSDF] left the U.S. naval base at Yokosuka 
for Hawaii to join "Rimpac '94," joint Pacific Ocean exercises 
sponsored by the U.S. Navy. In addition to Japan and the United 
States, the participating countries are Canada, Australia, and 
the ROK. In connection with calls for sanctions against the 
DPRK (North Korea) over the nuclear inspection issue, Japan, the 
United States, and the ROK will be on the same team for the 
first time in military exercises. Although the MSDF emphasizes 
that "the training assumes no specific situation," the issue of 
exercising the right to collective self-defense, banned under 
the constitution, appears likely to surface once again. 
  The highlight of Rimpac '94 is to be an exercise in which 
the 
participants oppose one another in waters off Hawaii. The 
scenario has not been made public. But "Team X," which consists 
of two groups -- one organized around a U.S. carrier task force 
led by the aircraft carrier Independence and the MSDF destroyer 
unit, the other organized by a U.S. unit and ROK frigate vessels 
-- will assemble in waters off Hawaii and take back Hawaii from 
the enemy. 
  The opposing force, "Team U," consists of U.S., Canadian, 
and 
Australian ships. For two weeks in mid-June, the two teams will 
conduct exercises comprehensively combining surface warfare, 
antisubmarine warfare [ASW], and air defense operations. 
  In Rimpac '94, the ROK for the first time will join Team X, 
consisting until now only of Japan and the United States. The 
ROK, participating in its third Rimpac exercise, had been on the 
opposing team the previous two times. While it has not been 
made clear why the teams have been changed this time, it is 
natural to regard it as reflecting the situation on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  When the United Nations decides to impose sanctions against 
North Korea over the nuclear inspections issue, ships from the 
navies of several nations may jointly conduct naval blockade 
actions. In that case, the commander of U.S. Forces Korea would 
have command over ROK forces. Therefore, points out a source 
related to the Defense Agency, "The aim of this exercise is 
probably to strengthen U.S.-ROK ties through Rimpac." 
  On the other hand, the Maritime Staff Office [MSO] stresses 
that Rimpac maneuvers are "not intended for any specific nation 
or sea area." Concerning the first Japan-U.S.-ROK combination, 
too, the MSO denies that the exercise is a "path" to the 
exercise of the right of collective defense, saying: "There are 
Japan-U.S. and U.S.-ROK teams, so the three nations will never 
carry on maneuvers together." 
  From the standpoint of Team U, however, Japan, the United 
States, and the ROK are a united opposing force, which gives the 
strong impression of military ties between Japan, the United 
States, and the ROK. 
  When the MSDF first joined the Rimpac exercise in 1980, it 
came under attack for "participation in multinational military 
maneuvers constituting an exercise of the right to collective 
self-defense." However, not only is there the impression now 
that participation has become routine, but the participation of 
eight destroyers puts the level of MSDF participation second to 
that of the U.S. Navy. 
  There are deeply cooperative relations in Rimpac between the 
U.S. Navy and the MSDF. With MSDF ships participating in at-sea 
refueling of U.S. Navy vessels and ASW exercises for detecting 
and destroying submarines under the guidance of U.S. destroyers. 
The opposite chain-of-command cases also take place as a matter 
of course. 
  Moreover, the Kongo, the MSDF's Aegis-type destroyer with 
advanced air defense capability, will join Rimpac '94 for the 
first time and come under the U.S. carrier task force. Although 
the Japanese and U.S. fleets have separate commands, MSDF Chief 
of Staff Chiaki Hayashizaki says that "One has to say, according 
to one's point of view, that (the Aegis ship and other 
destroyers) will be escorting the U.S. aircraft carrier." 
  With the ROK's participation in the exercises, the issue of 
exercising the right to collective self-defense will inevitably 
recur. The MSDF describes Team X as "simply an issue of teams 
with no other intent," but there is an outstanding whiff of 
smoke in the statements of the Japanese and U.S. sides. 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata stated in his policy speech that 
Japan would deal with the North Korea issue in concert with the 
United States and the ROK even without UN resolutions. When 
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry visited Japan in April, he 
stressed the need for a settlement of the issue through 
dialogue, but noted that "it is important for the international 
community to show a firm stance through ties among the United 
States, Japan, and the ROK." 
  Specifically, in the event of an emergency situation on the 
Korean Peninsula, Japan is reportedly considering having the 
Self- Defense Force carry out such rear-echelon support as 
at-sea refueling, transport, and medical care. According to a 
senior Defense Agency official, "While participation in military 
actions is impossible under the constitution, cooperation is 
allowed." However, Japan has never discussed seriously whether 
"cooperation" is really possible. 
  However, from the viewpoint of the U.S. military, there is 
no 
border in terms of strategy between Japan and the ROK, both 
allies of the United States. Even between Japan and the ROK, 
their national interests are completely identical when it comes 
to an emergency on the Korean peninsula and the defense of the 
Tsushima straits. 
  Under such circumstances, Rimpac `94 is highlighting present 
relations among Japan, the United States, and the ROK. However, 
Japan should not freely strengthen military ties with foreign 
nations. Whether military ties are truly possible and, if so, 
to what extent, are issues for which debate based upon the 
Constitution are demanded.

  [Text] New Japan-U.S. framework talks have been resumed 
after being suspended for three and one-half months since former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said "No" during the summit in 
February. 
  Economic interdependence of the two countries has become so 
strong that relations are not about to be undermined merely 
because of a hiatus in intergovernmental discussions. However, 
if the suspension should persist too long, it will have an 
adverse impact on areas other than the economy. There's also the 
risk of worsening emotional attitudes between the peoples of the 
two nations. 
  The resumption of the talks is welcomed in terms of the fact 
they represent the avoidance of such a serious situation. We 
would like to see the two governments engage in constructive 
talks, but an evaluation of the agreement reached on the 
resumption of talks indicates that we cannot assume an 
optimistic outlook for the talks. 
  In reference to the key aspect of the agreement, U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor explained, "Japan obtained the 
clear commitment that the United States will not seek numerical 
goals and the United States obtained the commitment that it 
would place emphasis on results." 
  The agreement was phrased so that the goal "to increase 
participation and sales in Japan of competitive foreign 
products" would be evaluated by each sector, such as 
"automobiles and related parts." This language is being 
construed as pointing to emphasis on results. 
  The Japanese Government persisted in its objection to 
numerical goals as being managed trade. However, there is a very 
fine distinction between emphasis on results and managed trade. 
We cannot deny that an element of vagueness remains about the 
distinction. 
  The question now is how the agreement will be concretely 
reflected in the individual sectors on the basis of future 
negotiations. We imagine that both governments foresee difficult 
negotiations. The original deadline for negotiations, "July 
1994" has been eliminated. 
  In its "external economic reform outline" approved at the 
end 
of March, the Japanese Government announced that it would 
compile specific plans by the end of June to conduct 
negotiations in three specific sectors, to open markets through 
deregulation, and to administer the economy led primarily 
through domestic demand. 
  Deregulation measures are being studied by three working 
committees covering areas such as "housing and land." Among 
issues being considered in the area of expansion of domestic 
demand are income tax reductions after next year and the 
revision of the 10-year 130 trillion yen basic public works 
program. The program must be revised to reflect projects of 
substance. 
  A key to plans for expansion of domestic demand is the 
revision of the tax system. Although the Hata government is 
controlled by a minority coalition, the Liberal Democratic Party 
and the Social Democratic Party of Japan must be thoughtful and 
refrain from using that fact as a political issue. 
  One wonders why the Clinton administration has softened its 
stance on trade negotiations with Japan. Although there is the 
aspect of learning that unyielding Asian policies are not 
working well as a whole, the foremost issue affecting the policy 
change is probably the "turbulence of market forces." 
  Just as the threat was posed in the stance that a strong yen 
was welcomed if Japan did not make concessions, market 
skepticism prevailed in respect to the fragility of the U.S. 
economy and distrust of its economic policies, resulting in a 
weak dollar. 
  Attacks on Japan using attorney-like tactics cannot inspire 
sudden reversals of economic trends. Forceful policies that 
disregard economic fundamentals can bring about results which 
are contrary to hoped-for objectives. That lesson must be 
garnered from market turbulence by the U.S. authorities. 
  A similar statement can be made about Japan. Delays in 
market-opening measures and the slowness of economic recovery 
have caused an extension of the stubborn balance-of-payments 
surplus. On the other hand, increased exports to maintain 
optimum factory operating rates have given a boost to the strong 
yen. It's a case of exacerbating one's own problems. I feel that 
both politicians and bureaucrats are excessively insensitive to 
the current situation. 
  The Japanese Government, which had said "No" without any 
particular idea about what it was going to do to resolve the 
problem, has managed to gain resumption of the talks by what 
might be considered a default by the U.S. Government, but what 
takes place in the future is more important. We would like to 
see politicians and bureaucrats resolutely grapple with the 
issues at hand, mindful of the fact that economic reform is 
essential not for the United States but for the recovery of the 
Japanese economy.

  [Text] It was learned on 4 June that the United States 
asked Japan at the bilateral financial talks to amend the 
Securities and Exchange Act [SEA] and the Foreign Exchange and 
Foreign Trade Control Act [FEFTCA]. This was revealed by an 
international financial source. 
  The United States reportedly wants to broaden the definition 
of "securities" in the SEA, and is asking Japan to ease 
regulations on overseas transactions in financial instruments by 
institutional investors under the FEFTCA. 
  Financial services have been designated as an additional 
priority sector in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The 
United States has also asked for the liberalization of the 
market for public pension funds. This sector is now expected to 
emerge as a major controversial issue in the framework talks. 
Finance Ministry Takes a Negative Attitude [subhead] 
  The present Japanese SEA adopts the "positive list" method 
under which a list is drawn up of financial instruments 
considered to be "securities." The United States, however, 
wants this changed to the "negative list" method which details 
everything not considered "securities." 
  It seems the United States wants to broaden the definition 
of 
"securities" to create a better environment for foreign 
securities firms -- which have an advantage in designing new 
financial instruments -- to freely develop new products freely 
in order to increase their business opportunities. In the past, 
new products from foreign securities firms have taken an 
extremely long time to win permits because they were not 
considered "securities" under the SEA. 
  When institutional investors other than banks and securities 
firms buy financial instruments overseas, they are required to 
have minimum foreign currency deposits. Under the present 
FEFTCA, such foreign currency deposits are governed by a permit 
system. 
  A senior U.S. Government official has pointed out that 
"Japanese institutional investors are obstructing full access to 
innovative products and services available from foreign 
financial institutions." 
  According to the Securities Bureau, the Finance Ministry 
takes a negative view on the issue of amending the SEA, claiming 
that "if coverage of securities gets even partially out of 
control, it may not be possible to protect the investors." 
  As far as FEFTCA is concerned, the International Finance 
Bureau says that "the existing law fully meets the needs of 
investors." Bilateral talks are expected to experience rough 
sailing.

<F P=106> [By Tetsu Miyazawa] </F>
  [Text] Nissan Motor has decided to increase four or five 
times the amount of sun visor imports from the U.S. Prince 
Company within two years. At present, it is installing them only 
on some high-class cars such as the "Leopard J Ferry" and 
"Cima," but they are expanding use to compact cars. In addition 
to the price being two to three times cheaper than Japanese 
products, the design is superior and the response to small 
design changes is said to be quick, on a par with Japanese 
manufacturers. It is not the result of outside pressure for 
purchase of U.S. products, but that the Nissan design team is 
charmed and praises them, saying "Prince Company potential is 
wonderful" (Masatomo Okahara, deputy manager, International 
Procurement Department). 
  Nissan has worked out a voluntary plan to purchase U.S. 
products in the amount of $4.3 billion (80-percent increase over 
actual amount in fiscal 1992) in fiscal 1997. Moreover, as a 
trump card to survive in the low price competition era, they 
recently have put on sale the "Sunny Lukino" which falls greatly 
below 1 million yen without an air conditioner. The profit 
margin simply becomes smaller the more the price is lowered. 
There is no wait to use overseas parts which have the advantage 
in cost. 
  "We are scouting excellent companies like Prince and drawing 
out their best" (Masaaki Machida, chief officer, International 
Procurement Department). Nissan's purchase policy on overseas 
parts manufacturers is strict control of local manufacturers on 
cost, differing somewhat from the Toyota Motor style which does 
basic retraining. 
  That position can be perceived in the MIG (manufacturing 
improvement group) activities which U.S. Nissan Motor 
Manufacturing Co. (NMMC; Tennessee), the U.S. base for Nissan 
Motor, has been implementing at targeted parts manufacturers 
with whom they do business locally since 1993. The main details 
are that MIG's divide those with whom they do business into 
groups by region and each group voluntarily holds field trips to 
superior plants and they mutually hold study groups to propose 
cost reductions to each other. 
  MIG's have already been formed in the three regions of 
Tennessee, Michigan, and Kentucky. Five to seven companies 
participate in the respective groups and they anticipate further 
expansion of the number of companies and regions in the future. 
Although NMMC takes the lead in activities such as the study 
groups, "Basically, the main body is spontaneous activities by 
the local parts manufacturers" (Deputy Manager Okahara). 
  One result is that the U.S. Davis Company, a major 
manufacturer of pressed parts such as oil pans, voluntarily 
prepared a manual on rationalization suiting its own company 
based on the rationalization methods learned in the study group 
with Nissan Motor. As a result of applying this to subsidiary 
secondary and tertiary manufacturers, its has realized a large 
overall cost reduction. 
  Moreover, "The places permanently stationing businessmen who 
can speak Japanese have increased among U.S. manufacturers with 
whom we do business," and that effect seems to be spreading. 
  It is said that Toyota and Nissan have traditionally 
differed 
greatly in methods of demanding rationalization. The person in 
charge of the auto industry at a certain think tank says, 
"Toyota gets into the management of parts companies and finds 
and implements types of fine cost reductions. With Nissan, there 
are many examples where they leave it voluntarily up to the 
parts company after they have indicated goals." The difference 
in posture of both companies domestically can also be perceived 
in overseas purchase policy. 
  Insofar as viewing the settlement of accounts of the parts 
manufacturers affiliated with both companies in the past few 
years in Japan, the Toyota style wins. The answers to how the 
differentiation will be in the future overseas and how much 
overseas parts can be managed are yet to come.

  [Text] On 3 June, Japan and the United States resumed 
negotiations on government procurement under the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks. During the negotiations, U.S. 
negotiators did not drop the U.S. proposal to discuss expanding 
the procurement of equipment by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone 
Corporation (NTT). Why is the United States taking a tough stand 
on the NTT's procurement of equipment? As one of reasons for the 
United States taking such a tough stand, an official familiar 
with telecommunications projects has cited the fact that the NTT 
and the private sector are set to take the lead in promoting the 
project for building Japan's next- generation telecommunications 
network (the optical fiber communications network). The United 
States therefore has to attach great importance to selling its 
telecommunications equipment to NTT. Japanese negotiators are 
agonizing over how to deal with the U.S. proposal, claiming "It 
is not rational for the governments of the two countries to 
discuss the Japanese private sector's procurement." 
  The project for building the next-generation 
telecommunications network is aimed at installing optical fiber 
cables and replacing the current telephone switchboards with 
digital-type telephone switchboards across Japan by the year 
2010 and the new telecommunications network will make it 
possible to transmit a large volume of information including 
clear live visual images at a high speed. It has been pointed 
out that the next-generation telecommunications network will 
become an important infrastructure to shore up the multimedia. 
Japan is expected to invest 75-95 trillion yen to build the 
next-generation telecommunications network, and the project for 
the network will provide American corporations with great 
business opportunities. 
  Which organizations will take charge of building the next- 
generation telecommunications network? This question has so far 
been a focal point. At first, the idea surfaced that a 
corporation should be established to build the network. The 
Telecommunications Council (an advisory body to the minister of 
posts and telecommunications) compiled a report in late May 
asserting that "the NTT and private enterprises should take the 
lead in building the next-generation telecommunications 
network." The report drew a conclusion on the question of which 
organizations should take charge of building the network. The 
report made the assertion after concluding that using the 
private sector's vitality can better contribute to building the 
next-generation telecommunications network. The task for the 
United States has become more how to sell American 
telecommunications apparatus to the NTT than to the Japanese 
Government. 
  The negotiations on government procurement under the 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks are mandated to discuss ways 
to increase the government's procurement of foreign equipment 
and materials. The U.S. attitude is that "the Japanese 
Government holds a stake in the NTT and the NTT is a 
semi-official organization. The two countries can discuss the 
NTT's procurement at the negotiations on government 
procurement." The Foreign Ministry is not hiding its 
embarrassment. 
  The prevailing view is that behind the U.S. proposal is a 
concerted strategy charted by the U.S. Administration and the 
private sector that aims to establish American superiority over 
Japan in telecommunications and information technologies. Some 
Japanese Government officials, who want to move the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks forward one way or other, have begun 
voicing the need to hold another Japan-U.S. governmental parley 
to discuss the "NTT issue."

  [Text] (London, 21 May--Hiroshi Inoue) The European Union 
(EU) has made a decision to recommend to the United States 
establishment of a joint project involving Japan, the United 
States, and Europe to devise international technical standards 
for the next-generation information highway. The EU is about to 
complete work on the European edition of the "information 
highway concept" by the end of this month and participate in a 
joint project to develop standards with the United States which 
is engaged in a similar project, but has decided to persuade the 
United States of the three-region approach in view of opposition 
from U.S. industry over the idea of adding Japan to the joint 
effort. However, the EU has cited as a condition for the 
three-region approach implementation of deregulation by Japan, 
signaling the need for Japan to clearly provide deregulation in 
the area of information and telecommunications as part of the 
external economic measures outline to be completed by the end of 
June. 
  According to European information industry sources, EU and 
U.S. representatives met in New York last month and agreed to a 
mutual linkup of the U.S. "information superhighway" and the 
European next-generation high-speed communications network as 
well as the joint development of applicable standards. They also 
discussed joint research with Japan, but U.S. industry 
representatives expressed strong reluctance to joint development 
with Japan for fear of an expansion in Japan's share of related 
programs. 
  The U.S. Government will propose the formulation of 
standards 
for international linkage of next-generation high-speed 
communications networks at the International Telecommunication 
Union (ITU) plenary meeting to be held in Japan in September. 
The objective of U.S. industry sources is to have Japan adopt 
standards developed under the auspices of the United States. 
  In previous conferences, the U.S. side appears to have asked 
the EU side to collaborate in the suggested approach, after 
pointing out that if next-generation high-speed communications 
network standards were jointly developed with an equal voice 
exercised by Japan, the United States, and Europe, the risk 
existed that Japanese information and communications equipment 
makers would expand their market share in Europe and the United 
States. 
  In response, the EU pointed out that influential Japanese 
computer makers are already deeply involved because of a central 
role being played in European programs by British ICL, which is 
80-percent owned by Fujitsu, and French Bull, in which NEC has a 
4.43-percent interest, and therefore advocated that "Japan 
should be included in the development of standards." 
  However, some sources in the EU embrace the position that 
"unification of standards should be handled primarily by the 
United States and Europe, and Japan should be limited to a role 
of joint development," which means that in order for Japan to 
gain the support of the EU, it must make major concessions on 
the deregulation issue as strongly advocated by the United 
States and the EU.

  [Text] Omron announced on 30 May that it has established a 
fully financed local corporation, "Omron (China) Ltd." 
(abbreviation OCE) in Beijing, China. The new company will be 
the regional headquarters that will control the other local 
corporations that Omron has established in China, make the 
optimum allocation of personnel and capital among the local 
corporations, and centrally manage sales promotion and technical 
service in China. The aim is to make local decisionmaking swift 
and expand the China business. 
  Itohchu has already established a similar controlling 
company 
in China, but this will be the first case for a major 
manufacturer. 
  The capital for OCE is $10.7 million, Omron senior director 
Hideki Masuda will be the part-time supervisor (chairman), and 
for the time being there will be 30 employees, which will 
increase to 60 in three years. 
  OCE is a company which generally is called "an umbrella 
corporation" in China, and it will supervise the four production 
companies for control equipment, etc., that Omron previously 
established in China. Besides management of earnings, 
cultivation of personnel, and taking charge of legal and 
financial advice for the various subsidiary companies, it will 
receive business commissions from the various subsidiary 
companies and handle customer service activities such as sales 
promotion. 
  It will also have a production control function to adjust 
the 
operations of the various subsidiary companies to conform to 
local market trends. 
  If Omron should establish a joint-venture company in China 
in 
the future, the policy would be to have it funded by OCE. When 
the OCE funding ratio tops 25 percent, that joint-venture 
company will be able to obtain preferential measures in the tax 
system as a foreign-invested firm.

  [Text] Sendai City, which is proceeding with a conversion 
program from city gas to LNG (liquefied natural gas), announced 
on 27 May that it has concluded sales negotiations on LNG with 
Malaysia LNG Company. The formal signing will be Kuala Lumpur in 
the middle of July after they have received approval at a 
special municipal assembly session at the end of June. With 
prospects good for securing the raw material, the city will 
start on construction of a receiving base in Sendai harbor, 
aiming at introduction of LNG in 1997. 
  The details of the "confirmation of intent" that will be the 
premise of the sales contract agreed between Sendai city and 
Malaysia LNG are 1) the contract period will be for a 20-year 
period beginning in 1997, and the total import amount will be 
2.9 million tons; 2) Malaysia LNG will build a special tanker 
and Sendai city will assume the obligation for that; and 3) the 
place for transfer of the LNG will be the base in Sendai harbor. 
The formal sales contract that will determine the price, etc., 
will be concluded within the next one to two years. 
  The Sendai city LNG introduction program is the conversion 
of 
city gas, which supplies 356,000 households, from butane to LNG; 
total project costs such as for construction of the receiving 
base will be 85.8 billion yen. It initially had studied a method 
of receiving domestically produced LNG from Niigata by pipeline, 
but ultimately chose the tanker from overseas method and 
proceeded in negotiations with Malaysia LNG as the importer.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article; part one of series entitled </F>
"Bureaucrats and the Coalition Government": "The Finance 
Ministry Continues To Push for a High Consumption Tax"] 
  [Text] On 10 May, shortly after Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata's minority government came into full operation, a Ministry 
of Finance [MOF] division head called on opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] executives, including Secretary General 
Yoshiro Mori, at the LDP headquarters. 
  A senior LDP executive advised: "I fully understand your 
feelings, but you do not have to work out a tax reform plan in a 
hurry until the political situation's future development becomes 
clearer. Just take it easy." 
  Since then, high-ranking MOF officials have been paying 
frequent visits to LDP headquarters. On 27 May, Tadashi Ogawa, 
director general of the Finance Ministry's Tax Bureau, called on 
Chairman Ryutaro Hashimoto, of the LDP Policy Research Council, 
to give him an explanation of the ministry report, "A Technical 
Estimate on Tax Reform," which was submitted to the government's 
Tax Commission on the same day. Hashimoto and Ogawa reportedly 
had the following conversation: "In this report, there are 
several figures that might be criticized as having been 
calculated arbitrarily by the MOF" (Hashimoto). "Thank you for 
your advice, we will think up an appropriate explanation for 
that" (Ogawa). 
<H5>  The Air of Crisis Is Growing at the MOF Because of Political </H5>
Instability 
  "After all, MOF officials are counting on the LDP," said an 
LDP Policy Research Council member, with a smile. However, the 
LDP is not the only party frequented by MOF officials. The 
ministry is also working hard to persuade the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] and New Party Sakigake that a high 
consumption tax is indispensable. 
  Since the coalition government led by former Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa was formed in August 1993, the MOF has been 
making steady progress in paving the way for a high consumption 
tax, although it was once frustrated in its scheme to introduce 
a 7 percent national welfare tax. However, its scenario was 
suddenly upset by the SDPJ's departure from the ruling 
coalition. The preconditions for tax reform virtually 
disappeared following the formation of a minority government 
plagued with the prospect of an early election. 
  Until now, high-ranking MOF officials have been counting 
heavily on Shinseito, which favors a high consumption tax. "The 
MOF has considerably changed its coercive attitude following the 
turmoil caused by the national welfare tax proposal," a Tax 
Commission member said, commenting on the fact that MOF 
officials are now paying frequent visits to the opposition 
parties. Why are they adopting an omnidirectional approach and 
a low profile? "We are now obliged to listen to every party, 
because any party can come into power depending on how the next 
coalition is formed," a senior MOF Tax Bureau official said. 
  However, bureaucrats are tough by nature. They may change 
their tactics but they never change their strategy. Senior MOF 
Tax Bureau officials are ordering their staffs to lobby openly 
for a tax hike. They are saying: "It does not matter if we look 
like Don Quixote. We must push for a high consumption tax." 
<H5>  MOF Officials Are Also Looking After the Ministry's Interests </H5>
  "Even if we prepare a bill, we do not know if it will pass 
the Diet or not. All our efforts might prove fruitless." Some 
minor officials once made such complaints. Among high-ranking 
officials, there is a sense of growing crisis that the tax hike 
issue might be put on the shelf if the MOF uses passive tactics, 
while income tax cuts alone might be renewed on a long-term 
basis. Should things come to such a pass, the fiscal balance 
would continue to worsen. Behind this sense of mounting crisis 
lies the bureaucrats' eagerness to protect their ministry's 
interests. "If the fiscal balance worsens, MOF officials will 
be embarrassed because their authority over budget drafting will 
be weakened," a senior Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry official said. Be the matter as it may, high-ranking 
officials are determined to push for a high consumption tax no 
matter how severely they are criticized. Their enthusiasm is 
the driving force of the entire ministry. 
  Their firm resolution clearly appears in the ministry's 
report entitled, "A Technical Estimate on Tax Reform," which 
projects Japan's fiscal balance in fiscal year 2000 based on 
consumption tax rates ranging from 7 to 10 percent. The report 
underscores the need for a consumption tax higher than 7 percent 
to cover revenues lost from income tax cuts and to meet the 
growing fiscal demands for social welfare. MOF officials had 
initially planned to include another option that calls for a 
counterbalancing increase of 6 percent in the consumption tax to 
be implemented after two years of income tax cuts. However, 
they dropped this option and decided to directly push for a net 
tax increase. By thrusting a set of figures proving Japan's 
critical fiscal conditions before politicians and the public, 
MOF officials hope to create an atmosphere that a large-scale 
income tax hike is unavoidable. Once the atmosphere is 
produced, they will leave the final decision to the politicians. 
<H5>  MOF Officials Welcome Even Provocative Remarks </H5>
  There is a difference in views between the MOF and the 
government's Tax Commission, which will use the ministry's 
figures when it compiles its final report. For instance, Tax 
Commission Chairman Hiroshi Kato stresses the need for 
administrative reform, which the MOF does not want to include in 
the preconditions for tax reform. However, MOF officials now 
even welcome provocative remarks. "We want Chairman Kato to 
make provocative remarks from time to time, because this will 
help arouse people's concern on the tax hike issue. What we 
fear most is the general public's indifference toward this 
matter," they said. 
  Meanwhile, some members of the ruling coalition's Tax Reform 
Council are proposing to examine the possibility of a 
consumption tax lower than 6 percent, in an effort to gain 
public support in view of the next general elections. In 
response to this proposal, the MOF will present an additional 
version of "A Technical Estimate on Tax Reform," which will give 
a projection of the fiscal balance in 2000 based on consumption 
tax rates ranging from 4 to 6 percent. MOF officials seem to be 
quite certain that the new version will further help prove how 
critical Japan's fiscal conditions are. They hope that it will 
become another strong tool for pushing the view that a high 
consumption tax is inevitable. It is clear that the MOF is 
trying to control the policy-making process, although the wind 
is blowing against it.

  [Text] As a whole, businesses listed on the stock exchanges 
reported declining revenues and profits for the year ending in 
March 1994. It represented the fourth year of consecutive 
declining profits in the postwar period and it seems that we 
could hear cries that "we cannot tolerate a further decline." It 
is predicted that fiscal year 1994, which ends next March, will 
reflect a throttling of the declining profits, but we cannot 
necessarily be optimistic. 
  Conditions affecting businesses were difficult during the 
past year. The yen advanced in value amidst historically low 
interest rates. Movements intensified to correct foreign and 
domestic price differentials, and "destruction of price 
structures" spread. Both major and midsized businesses were 
forced to adapt to globalization based on imports of materials 
and products from overseas, especially Asia, giving birth to the 
situation where Japanese businesses can no longer adhere to 
keiretsu transactions. It was also necessary to dispose of 
issues left as a result of the bursting bubble. The various 
firms worked assiduously to improve corporate performance, but 
earnings reports testify that they were not able to take 
adequate remedial actions. 
  A sector analysis shows that raw materials makers such as 
steel and chemicals faced recessionary conditions and that 
fabrication and assembly firms recorded varying results. 
However, of even greater significance than differences between 
industries was the sharp contrast in performance among firms of 
the same industry in response to the existence or lack of 
management actions taken to improve corporate performance. 
  The severity of the problems surfacing as a result of the 
bubble economy and the differences in skills associated with the 
handling of restructuring projects have determined the ultimate 
performance of individual corporations. Firms that took early 
remedial and bold actions to restructure have succeeded in 
producing minimally acceptable results. Additionally, skills 
exercised in responding to "price destruction measures" such as 
the procurement of materials and products from overseas made a 
difference in corporate performance. It was a phenomenon visible 
even in the United States, but we cannot overlook the fact that 
major corporations had a tendency to be hobbled by past 
performance and to suffer from delays in restructuring. 
  There are signs of a recovery in the economy. Conservative 
restructuring actions such as reducing fixed expenses have 
progressed to a considerable degree. Industries operating in the 
information equipment, housing, and environmental equipment 
sectors will probably undergo aggressive restructuring while 
focusing on primary goals. As long as the future sees growth in 
demand leading to increased sales, underpinnings for increased 
profits now being laid will come into play. However, we have not 
passed the stage of operational reductions, balancing of supply 
and demand, and prospects for reduced profits in the 
nonmanufacturing sector, and most corporations are still 
cautious about capital outlays and the issue of employment 
instability still lingers on. 
  The foregoing condition probably persists because individual 
firms do not have the resources to resolve all of the pending 
issues. Taking the single issue of foreign exchange, most firms 
visualize a rate of 105 yen to the dollar for the year ending in 
March 1995, but if the rate should fall below 100 yen during the 
year, there is the risk that corporate programs will become 
unattainable. A strong yen means lower materials costs and 
provides businesses with some advantages, but it is a matter of 
degree and it could have an unbearable impact on Japanese 
society if it leads to a hollowing of industrial sectors. We 
cannot overlook factors such as the direction of Japan-U.S. 
trade talks, deregulation, and the effects of political trends 
on business psychology and performance. 
  Notwithstanding, it is not a time for inaction because of 
the 
vagueness of external factors. We see a movement emerging that 
favors a departure from the trend to reduce the scope of 
business operations. Although the structural strength of 
corporations has been weakened by several years of difficult 
economic conditions and there is some concern about how long 
they can persist, we cannot help but hope that they will 
persevere and expand their current efforts.

<F P=106> [Article by Takashi Obayashi] </F>
  [Text] A situation in which "values are being influenced by 
an excessive money supply" is being created in domestic 
financial and capital markets. The reason is that the Bank of 
Japan [BOJ] has taken a clear-cut position of monetary easing 
with the objective of aiding in the recycling of capital to the 
United States in conjunction with monetary tightening in that 
country. Money is increasingly being traded for financial assets 
such as stocks and bonds, instead of being used for capital 
investments. 
  A change has taken place in the short-term financial markets 
since the May holiday season. The noncollateralized next-day 
call rate fell to a historic low of just above 2 percent and the 
differential between it and the official discount rate 
(currently at 1.75 percent) which in the past had been 
maintained at a minimum of 0.5 percent dropped to the 
0.2-percent range, providing for only a minimal differential. 
  Bond and stock prices have reacted with sensitivity and the 
Nikkei average at one time set new highs for the year. According 
to a fund manager at a major investment trust company, a change 
in perspectives is emerging which says, "City banks are in a 
position where they have no choice but to allocate capital 
generated from call markets to investments in the stock market." 
  It was none other than the BOJ that caused a "drop in 
short-term interest rates as seen on the eve before the cut in 
the official discount rate," according to an official at a city 
bank-affiliated major leasing firm. 
  "What will be the next step taken by the people on the 
second 
floor," is a question that reflects the sole concern of BOJ 
watchers at city banks. The second floor is where the BOJ 
Operations Bureau is located. The reason was that the position 
of counselor for the Operations Bureau, whose incumbent is 
responsible for directing monetary adjustments, was vacated by 
Mr. Minoru Masubuchi and filled by Mr. Yoshiharu Obata formerly 
deputy director of the Planning Bureau during the regular 
personnel shuffle in May. 
  It appears that the BOJ will maintain the low interest rate 
policy of the "Masuda period." Even on the 24th and 25th, the 
BOJ fed funds to the short-term markets at rates which exceeded 
the expectations of market sources and maintained 
noncollateralized next-day call interest rates at historically 
low levels. 
  BOJ President Yasushi Mieno states, "The economy shows signs 
of bottoming and the climate in support of a recovery is 
stronger than last year." If signs of an economic recovery are 
visible, common sense in the past would dictate somewhat of a 
tightening of the monetary supply, but one wonders why the BOJ 
has resumed a policy of guiding interest rates to a lower level. 
  A viewpoint quietly mentioned in the markets is based on the 
theory considering the value of the yen. Noboru Nagai, 
International Capital-Foreign Exchange Department chief of the 
Tokyo branch of the Netherlands Bank, presumes the BOJ's change 
in attitude as reflecting a situation in which, "The BOJ was 
asked to participate in policy coordination with the U.S. 
monetary authorities who wished to avoid a further drop in the 
declining dollar." 
  Officially, the BOJ merely repeats itself when it says, "We 
do not manage interest policy for the purpose of controlling the 
value of the yen." The reason given by BOJ officials is, "There 
will be no limit if we were to drop interest rates in 
coordination with the value of the yen," in view of the fact 
that the official discount rate is at 1.75 percent, the lowest 
level among the advanced nations. However, notwithstanding, the 
BOJ has been forced to undertake strong market action to provide 
for low market interest rates. 
  However, there is the viewpoint that, "A strong yen is 
merely 
an excuse for action to provide for the recent lowering of 
interest rates. A second ulterior motive is concealed in 
President Mieno's statement which says, "The balance sheets of 
financial institutions require further adjustments." 
  Lower short-term interest rates directly lead to a reduction 
in banks' capital procurement costs. "Lower interest rates 
leading to higher stock prices" will enable banks to raise funds 
for amortizing bad loans based on profits from stock holdings. 
Soichi Hirabayashi, chief of the Funding Department of Fuji 
Bank, points out, "A bottoming of the economy does not 
necessarily signal a unilateral rise in market interest rates." 
This is a case where the BOJ is creating an abundant money 
supply. 
  The BOJ is following the footsteps of the U.S. Federal 
Reserve Board (FRB) in terms of the latter's monetary policy 
after 1990. There is a precedent in which the FRB assumed an 
ultra-monetary-easing policy--in which it assumed a real 
short-term interest rate of zero after deducting the anticipated 
inflation rate from the nominal interest rate--for a period of 
18 months in which it encouraged stock and bond prices to rise. 
  The creation of financial values by policy officials and the 
bold disposition of bad loans despite the recording of losses 
enabled U.S. banks to stage a widespread recovery from their 
problems. However, complications from such an approach were also 
sizeable. Although it is said that the current turbulence in 
U.S. financial and stock markets are the result of monetary 
tightening since February, a major factor is a reaction to the 
easy money valuations. 
  It can be said that the BOJ is in effect being forced to 
follow the footsteps of the FRB. If attention is focused only on 
adjustments necessary to cope with the collapse of the bubble, 
there is the definite risk that we will again invite a market 
reaction.

  [Text] The Ministry of Finance [MOF] has made a decision to 
approve the establishment of "winning-bid companies" [jiko 
kyoraku gaisha] which are 100-percent-owned subsidiaries of 
banks designed to purchase collateralized real estate offered by 
such banks in an auction and to allow such subsidiaries to 
engage in real estate operations. The formula allowing the 
subsidiaries to purchase such real estate under a winning-bid 
process will ensure the preservation of fairness in transfer 
prices, and the ability to purchase adjacent lots will enhance 
the value of the collateralized property. Having concluded that 
such arrangements would promote the liquidity of collateralized 
real estate and lead to restoring soundness in bank assets, the 
MOF will issue a bulletin authorizing the establishment of real 
estate subsidiaries effective in June for a duration of 10 years. 
  As a way to recover principal, banks have auctioned off 
through court proceedings real estate used as collateral by 
debtors who have failed to pay off loans. Procedures exist for 
the disposition of real estate without resorting to court 
proceedings, but auctions ensure fair pricing and eliminate the 
risk of being eyed by the tax authorities for potential tax 
evasion. Further, there is less risk of the sale being opposed 
by lower-ranking creditors and the ability to avoid disputes 
among interested parties. 
  Auctions have many such advantages, but the severe recession 
in the real estate market has created many cases in which buyers 
cannot be found even at the minimum acceptable auction price. 
Accordingly, the situation gave birth to the idea of 
establishing winning-bid companies that are 100-percent-owned 
subsidiaries and submission of a winning bid by such 
subsidiaries when other buyers could not be found. 
  The MOF will also approve such winning-bid company real 
estate firms to operate as home builders. Banking laws prohibit 
subsidiaries to engage in other businesses, but an exception 
will be given with the proviso that the properties to be handled 
will be limited to the collateralized properties and adjacent 
lots.

  [Text] International Telecommunications of Japan (ITJ; Chuo 
ward, Tokyo; Hiroshi Ohara, president), a new international 
common carrier, will begin offering international video data 
transmission services within the year. It will aim to provide 
low-cost transmission services through the use of digital 
transmission using what is called the "C-band." In the past, 
international video data transmission was monopolized by Kokusai 
Denshin Denwa (KDD), but it appears that lower rates will go 
into effect with the participation of ITJ. 
  On the 30th, ITJ and Fuji Television conducted a joint 
experiment in transmitting digital data between Japan and the 
United States. A tracking and data relay system (TDRS) satellite 
and digital receiving facilities owned by Columbia 
Communications was used to transmit animated images from an 
Earth satellite station located in Washington State to Fuji 
Television headquarters in Shinjuku ward, Tokyo. 
  "C-band" operates at a frequency where attenuation 
distortion 
is minimal during rainfall. The recent experiment involved the 
use of the "Ku-band" because of the fear of jamming in the case 
of Earthbound radio waves in Japan, and demonstrated the 
commercial feasibility of receiving services.

  [Text] On 30 May, the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications [MOPT] announced that it will hold hearings 
in the early part of next month, involving industry 
representatives, aimed at lifting the ban on "connections 
between dedicated circuits leased by businesses from Type I 
telecommunications operators such as Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone (NTT) and urban public circuits operated by NTT. Such 
connections will have the impact of subleasing of so-called 
telephone circuits. Reductions in long-distance call rates and 
expansion of business opportunities can be expected on the one 
hand, while an adverse impact on NTT earnings can be expected on 
the other hand. The MOPT plans to use the hearings to determine 
the impact on NTT operations because of the proposed lifting of 
the existing ban and the necessary relief measures. 
  According to MOPT officials, if the ban is lifted on 
connections of public and dedicated circuits, "Theoretically, 
long-distance call rates should drop by about 30 percent." 
Currently, long-distance call rates using NTT's public and 
long-distance circuits are 180 yen for three minutes, while the 
same call using NTT public circuits and long-distance circuits 
owned by one of the new telegraph and telephone companies would 
be 120-140 yen. These rate reductions are expected to encourage 
growth in new ventures such as mail order businesses.

  [Text] In a news conference held on 26 May, President Kazuo 
Fujimori of electric-power company-affiliated regional telephone 
company Tokyo Tsushin Network (TTNet) stated, "We have asked the 
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] to consider as 
an issue for research," the partial interconnection of circuits 
among Type I telecommunications operators that own and offer 
communication services. In the past, the MOPT had rejected the 
idea because it could have a major impact on long-distance 
communications operators such as DDI and that the change "was 
unnecessary." The informal U.S. request for deregulation of the 
communications industry may serve as a trigger for a change in 
MOPT policy concerning interconnections. 
  In reference to the linking of communications networks owned 
by the nine electric-power company-affiliated regional telephone 
companies, TTNet President Fujimori comments, "We have asked the 
MOPT to consider the linking of adjacent telephone companies as 
a matter for research. However, because of the existence of 
three new long-distance telephone companies, it will be 
difficult to link all regional telephone companies." 
  There is a strongly rooted view that the linkage of regional 
telephone companies is an idea that should be developed to 
provide competition for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), 
which monopolizes urban telecommunications networks. However, 
the decontrol programs that went into effect in 1985 provided 
for a division of operating areas designed to ensure a specified 
revenue and profit base for long-distance and regional telephone 
companies and did not authorize direct links among regional 
telephone companies. 
  On the other hand, at the regular press conference on 24 
May, 
MOPT Administrative Vice Minister Futoshi Shirai referred to the 
U.S. request for deregulation and expressed caution, saying, "We 
have not received a formal request, but there is a need to study 
the proposal for consistency with basic concepts of the past." 
  After the press conference, Vice Minister Shirai said, "I 
have heard that there is hardly any need for such linkage," 
reinforcing the past position of the MOPT.

  [Text] On 26 May, the Telecommunications Council (Ministry 
of Posts and Telecommunciations advisory organ) compiled a 
report on the collection of "public statements" to be used in 
connection with public hearings on the merits of raising 
telephone rates. Although the statements are still in the 
process of being collected, as of the most recent tally, 90 
percent of the individuals submitting public statements are in 
favor of the rate hikes. At a press conference on the same day, 
Shigemichi Sonoyama, chairman of the Telecommunications 
Operations Committee of the Telecommunications Council that is 
sponsoring the study and chairman of the Mobile Wireless Center 
expressed skepticism, saying, "There is the risk that those 
opposed to a rate hike have misconstrued the government's 
announcement of a rate hike freeze for the year as meaning that 
there is no fear of a hike even after next year." 
  The public hearings will be held in the middle of June in 
Tokyo, Osaka, Kumamoto, and Sendai and will involve the 
discussion of items such as the 18-percent average basic fee 
increase requested by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT). 
Public statements will be accepted until 30 May, but, as of 26 
May, 203 statements had been received and 182 of them expressed 
approval of the rate hikes or stated that they were unavoidable. 
  When public hearings were held on public telephone rate 
hikes 
in October 1993, 98 individuals approved of the hikes and 73 
opposed.

  [Text] Tokyo Electric Power is proceeding with a plan to 
establish a new large thermoelectric power station that will use 
liquid natural gas (LNG) as the heat source in newly reclaimed 
land in Tokyo Bay. Possibility of realization suddenly increased 
with the specific mention by Tokyo Prefecture of the power 
station site for the first time in the interim report of the Bay 
Plan made public recently. For Tokyo, which has depended 
unilaterally on power plants located in remote sites such as 
Fukushima and Niigata Prefecture, the significance of "Edo 
electric power" [Edo refers to traditional Tokyo] is great. 
  What is the number of power plants within the prefecture? 
  It seems a simple question, but it is a rather difficult 
problem. That is because in addition to widespread use of 
co-generation (thermoelectric combined supply) by plants, home 
electric generation, and large buildings, many small diesel 
power stations in outlying islands such as Miyakejima and 
Ogasawara are under Tokyo Electric Power jurisdiction. It is 
surprising, but there is even a small hydroelectric power 
station in the upper stream of the Tama River within the 
prefecture. 
  If narrowed down to Tokyo Electric Power's full-size power 
stations, however, there are only three stations, Oi 
Thermoelectric (oil), Shinagawa Thermoelectric (oil), and Hoshu 
Thermoelectric (gas turbine). The total power generation 
capability of these three power plants is about 1.67 million 
kilowatts. It is no more than 3.5 percent of all Tokyo Electric 
Power's power generation facilities. Compared with the amount of 
electric power consumed, Tokyo has a setup that can supply only 
a scant 8 percent of the electric power that it uses. 
  The reason that Tokyo Electric Power asked Tokyo Prefecture 
to sell the reclaimed land for power plant use was actually 
because of this self-sufficiency rate. Viewing large cities of 
the world, New York locally supplies 44 percent and London 
supplies 37 percent of its electric power. 
  Even in Japan, where power plant location is said to be the 
most difficult in the world, Osaka supplies 40 percent and 
Nagoya, 33 percent. 
  In Tokyo in the 1970's, there was a garbage war where ward 
opposed ward concerning garbage incineration sites. The 
residents strongly voiced that they did not want to build an 
incineration site in their own ward to burn garbage coming from 
other wards. It developed into a tumult where the border 
crossing of garbage was monitored. Changing the viewpoint, it 
was a dispute on the self-supply rate for each ward on garbage 
incineration. As a result, garbage incineration sites have been 
built in almost every ward. 
  A power plant is a public works facility with an order given 
to a construction company and a location subsidy. It brings a 
huge economic effect, such as property tax payments, to the 
local area. No direct comparison can be made with garbage 
incineration sites, where garbage collection trucks only form a 
line, but they share a common point in that persuasion of the 
local residents about location is difficult. That is why Tokyo 
Prefecture ignored the logic shown previously in garbage 
incineration with regard to electric power. 
  The building of a large power plant in Tokyo Bay is not just 
an issue of obligation to a self-governing body and the 
residents. 
  To use electric power generated in Fukushima and Niigata in 
the prefecture, large-scale power transmission facilities are 
necessary. At 386.4 billion yen, electric transmission 
facilities account for 22.9 percent of all Tokyo Electric 
Power's facilities investment, exceeding the total investment 
for nuclear power and thermoelectric power stations. Simply 
speaking, power transmission costs more than power generation. 
Moreover, there is also the problem of transmission loss due to 
heat in long-distance power transmission. 
  The new LNG thermoelectric power station which Tokyo 
Electric 
Power plans for the reclaimed land will be on the scale of 3 
million to 4.5 million kilowatts. If it were completed with 4 
million kilowatts, the electric power self-sufficiency rate for 
Tokyo Prefecture would be about 27 percent in 2008 when 
completion is scheduled. Even this cannot be called adequate, 
but they say "the burden for the transmission network will be 
decreased, and the stability of electric power supply will 
increase by leaps and bounds" (Tokyo Electric Power). 
  With the combined cycle (compound power generation) used in 
LNG thermoelectric power, energy efficiency is rapidly improved, 
and facility size also becomes compact. There is also a 
possibility that Tokyo Electric Power will be able to create a 
power station of more than 5 million kilowatts at the same site 
if the technology is available when the reclamation is finished 
and construction begins. 
  However, difficult problems remain such as the procurement 
and transport of the LNG fuel. In particular, the safety of 
bringing in more LNG than the 300 LNG tankers a year that 
currently enter Tokyo Bay should probably be debated. 
  However, the "economic democracy" of self-sufficiency in 
electric power is a viewpoint that must not be forgotten in the 
future energy business (Yasuhiro Goto).

  [Text] The outline of a report on the desired nature of 
the industrial structure in the 21st century has been revealed. 
This is a report compiled by an advisory committee for the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry by the Basic Issues 
Subcommittee of the Council for Industrial Structure (chaired by 
Kotaro Tsujimura). The report designates 12 areas as new and 
growing markets: housing, information/communications, energy, 
environment, medical/welfare, circulation/distribution, life 
culture/leisure, improvement of urban environment, international 
exchange, utilization of human resources, support for business, 
and new technology for new products. It also recommends further 
deregulation and strengthening of the policy to promote 
competition in each of these fields. Moreover, it proposes a 
shift of the industrial structure away from one dependent on 
export industries, such as automobiles and household appliances, 
to one determined by domestic demand. It points out that the 
smooth transfer of labor among industries is also indispensable 
and seeks an active policy for mobility in the labor market. 
The Council for Industrial Structure is scheduled to complete 
its final report on 16 June. Preceding that, the Council's 
Basic Issues Subcommittee will hold a joint meeting on 31 May 
with the Special Committee, which is in charge of administrative 
arrangements for the final report, and will firm up the outline. 
  What is noteworthy in the report's content is that the 
industrial policy, which up until now has centered on the 
supplier (enterprises, public corporations, and so on), is 
changed, and a new consumer-oriented point of view is adopted. 
As for the hollowing of industries, with the premise of a high 
yen and the correction of the domestic-overseas price gap, it 
takes the position that we should not worry excessively about 
it. That is because "the move, to some extent, to overseas as 
an alternative to importing (hollowing) is a structural 
adjustment itself." 
  On the whole, the report proposes that policies are 
necessary 
for: 1) macroeconomic measures which are centered around front- 
loaded enforcement of improvements in social overhead capital; 
2) microeconomic reforms such as deregulation, correction of the 
domestic-overseas price gap, and so on; and 3) smooth 
restructuring (restructuring of enterprises), improvement of the 
capital procurement market for the growth of new industries, and 
so on. If these were to be realized, the real growth rate for 
the Japanese economy would be about 3.2 percent annually until 
the year 2000. Thereafter, it would be able to maintain about 
2.4 percent, and the ratio of the current account surplus to the 
gross national product (GNP) would be held to between one and 
two percent. 
  As for housing, among the new/growing markets, it sets a 
target for housing costs to be reduced to two thirds of the 
current figure (90,000 yen [Y] to Y120,000 per square meter) and 
space to be increased by 30 percent (to 40 square meters per 
person). This will be done through a review of zoning 
regulations and promotion of the introduction of imported 
residential buildings which, in turn, will result from reform of 
construction standards. 
  As for the utilization of human resources, to accomodate the 
aging population and women's new role in society, the principles 
of of the Employment Stability Law's prohibitory regulations 
which govern employment agencies are to be reviewed. And at the 
same time, the type of jobs to which human resources can be 
allocated are to be increased. Further, the tax laws which 
involve severance pay and annuities, which have been 
disadvantageous for people who change jobs, are to be reformed. 
And a diverse employment situation which also includes 
non-long term and nonsecure employment is to be developed, and 
fluidity in the labor market is to be advanced. 
  The report takes up deregulation as a significant subject 
among new industrial policies. In addition to housing/land, 
information/communications, and import promotion, which the 
Headquarters for Administrative Reform Promotion is now 
studying, the report points out that the field of 
finance/securities/insurance should be examined. 
  Besides deregulation, it mentions the promotion of 
competition. It calls for examination of Anti-Monopoly Law 
violations as possible causes for a demand to cease undesirable 
practices under terms of the Unfair Competition Prevention Law. 
Furthermore, it advocates review of prohibitory rules for 
bonafide share-holding companies and of merger regulations. 
Further, it seeks to improve the corporation partition 
provision of the Commercial Law, and to simplify procedures for 
the merger/transfer of operations. 
  As for the nurturing of new industries, it says that reform 
of the finance/capital market is indispensable for 
diversification of capital fund procurement measures.

  [Text] In administrative inspection conducted by the 
Management and Coordination Agency [MCA] regarding water quality 
preservation measures such as for rivers and lakes and marshes 
used for tap water and industrial water, it was learned on 29 
May that water quality measures are as inadequate as ever, such 
as local self-governing bodies not proceeding with pollution 
source surveys for underground water where pollution is 
spreading nationwide. The MCA reviewed water quality 
preservation standards in the Environment Agency and recommended 
on the 30th that they strengthen pollution prevention measures 
such as designating pollution sources. 
  The recent administrative inspection was implemented by the 
MCA from April to July 1993, and in addition to rivers, sea 
areas, and underground water as the target of inspection, they 
surveyed for the first time the upgrading of comprehensive water 
quality preservation measures. 
  MCA surveyed areas where pollution of underground water has 
been confirmed due to the effects of harmful substances such as 
trichloroethane that is being used in semiconductor washing and 
dry-cleaning. Among the 56 districts surveyed, local governments 
are conducting soil surveys to designate pollution sources in 
only 28 districts. 
  The attainment rate for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and 
chemical oxygen demand (COD) in rivers, lakes and marshes, and 
sea areas nationwide was 59.6 percent in fiscal 1975, but rose 
to 75.2 percent in fiscal 1992. It has become a hit-the-top 
situation in just the past few years. 
  MCA has inspected the Environment Agency for designating 
pollution sources, recommended that they hasten measures, 
reviewed the types of water quality to be the objective of use 
and the criteria for preservations standards, and is demanding 
that the time to reach the standards be shortened. At the same 
time, they are strengthening on-the-spot inspections and are 
seeking strict measures for businesses that violate the drainage 
standards.

  [Text] In order to prevent the generation of 
trihalomethane, a carcinogenic substance which is formed during 
tap water disinfection by chlorine, a basic policy on 
preservation of water quality in tap water source water areas 
established by the Environment Agency [EA] was approved by the 
cabinet on 17. Although harmful substances such as cadmium were 
already regulated by the Water Quality Pollution Prevention Law, 
trihalomethane, a secondary generation, had been placed outside 
the subject of regulation. Moreover, according to results of 
earlier surveys by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, it has 
been revealed that the greatest value of trihalomethane 
concentration in 110 water purification plants of 94 concerns 
nationwide has exceeded 70 percent of the water quality standard 
for the past three years. In the midst of this, a special 
measures law was newly put into effect on 10 May with 
trihalomethane the target of regulation, narrowing the focus to 
tap water source water areas. Along with this, the EA recently 
established basic policy to make the law effective and provided 
specific application procedures. In the future, based on the 
demands of the waterworks industry, the EA will seek the 
provision of high-level water purification treatment facilities 
such as ozone treatment and granular activated charcoal 
treatment on a case-by-case basis, in addition to drainage 
regulations for plants and business establishments that are 
considered to discharge substances that are the source of 
trihalomethane in upstream river areas.

  [Text] Prime Minister Paul Keating has encouraged his 
British counterpart, John Major, to use Australia as a trade and 
investment springboard into Asia. Mr. Keating has also raised 
Australia's ongoing trade concerns with Canada in a separate 
meeting with the Canadian prime minister, Jean Chretien. Linda 
Mottram reports that Mr. Keating met the British and Canadian 
leaders in London where they are gathering for the commemoration 
of the World War II D-day landing of Normandy 50 years ago. 
  [Begin Mottram recording] Ahead of the D-day ceremony, Mr. 
Keating met with Mr. Major in London with trade and investment 
are key agenda items in what the two leaders have described as a 
strong relationship. Officials say Mr. Keating assured Mr. 
Major that Australia's push for closer economic links with Asia 
did not exclude the Australia-Britain relationship. The 
Australian Government is keen for Britain to use its very high 
level of investment in Australia as a window into Asia. The two 
leaders also discussed the forthcoming APEC [Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation] leaders' summit in Jakarta and ways of 
advancing the Asia Pacific Economic Grouping. 
  Mr. Keating talked with Canada's Jean Chretien who described 
by officials as equally warm although Mr. Keating noted the 
bilateral relationship had languished somewhat in particular 
over trade tension. Officials described Mr. Keating as putting 
a strong argument for Canada to particularly review its decision 
to impose tariff quotas on the imports of Australian boneless 
beef. [end recording]

  [Text] Australia says it has been incorporating human 
rights issues into its direct and indirect defense contact with 
Indonesia. The approach is outlined in an Australian Government 
response to a parliamentary report on relations with Indonesia. 
  The document said Australia's Defense Force did not provide 
training to Indonesian troops for internal security or 
counter-insurgency. 
  The statement said cooperation with Indonesian Special 
Forces 
focussed on low-level military and welfare skills, as well as 
communications operation, small arms practice, and medical 
training. 
  Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said the government shared the 
parliamentary committee's view that human rights was the most 
sensitive area of Australia's relations with Indonesia.

  [Text] There are further signs that Australia's economy is 
continuing to improve. National accounts figures just released 
show annual economic growth now stands at 5 percent -- up from 4 
percent previously. Belinda Trump reports that the figures are 
likely to increase fear the economy cannot keep up the pace. 
  [Begin Trump recording] Gross Domestic Products rose by 1.9 
percent in the March quarter -- double some market expectations. 
The main contributions to growth were strong household and 
government spending, while business investment remained weak. 
  The March quarter was the eleventh consecutive quarter of 
growth, but where the economy goes from here is a major issue. 
Financial markets see the fast growth as a pointer to rising 
inflation down the track and fear the government may have to 
bring forward an increase in interest rates to control economic 
growth. 
  For the moment, though, the government has the best of both 
world -- fast growth with further signs in today's figures that 
inflation during the March quarter remained low. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, the federal treasurer, Ralph Willis, says the big 
jump in economic growth confirms the Australian economy is on 
track for a sustained recovery. Mr. Willis says the strong 
growth marginally reflects the influence of a number of one-off 
factors, such as a big increase in public spending. 
  Treasurer says however, the complementary jump in private 
consumption, combined with rising profits, provides a highly 
favorable environment for increases in business investment. 
  The prime minister, Paul Keating says it is 30 years since 
the country has the economic conditions as good as this.

  [Text] Earlier this morning government troops launched 
intensified land, air, and sea strikes against the Abu Sayyaf 
group in the village of Lumbahan in Patikul, Sulu. 
  This was announced today by Jericho Kagawan, Philippine 
National Police [PNP] director for operations. He explained 
that the operation was a result of the group's continued refusal 
to stop their illegal activities. 
  The group is behind the series of kidnap-for-ransom cases in 
different parts of Mindanao. Negotiations were conducted with 
the group on stopping these activities, but they fell on deaf 
ears. 
  According to Kagawan, three Marine battalions supported by 
the PNP are currently sweeping down on the areas where the 
bandits are hiding.

  [Text] A loud explosion rocked a guarded area in downtown 
Zamboanga City late last night wounding at least 20 people. A 
report quoted by the Philippines News Agency said the explosion 
occurred in front of the Lehan Ice Cream House at about 1335, 
the place -- a large area of Zamboanga City -- under total 
darkness. 
  Police said most of the victims of explosion have been 
rushed 
to the nearby Zamboanga City Medical Center for treatment of 
shrapnel wounds. Chief Superintendent Roberto Lastimoso, 
Philippine National Police Regional Command 9 commander, said 
the explosion could have been a spillover of the ongoing 
military operations against the Abu Sayyaf group in Patikul, 
Sulu. 
  Meantime, a morning daily in Manila quoted the Zamboanga 
police as saying that the car where the bomb was apparently 
hidden was a total wreck. 
  Land mines planted by Muslim guerrillas, by the Abu Sayyaf, 
had slowed down a government assault on the bandits' stronghold 
in Patikul, Sulu. The military said that none of the marines 
advancing towards the main rebel camp in Patikul have been hit 
by the land mines. 
  Major General Orlando Soriano, Southern Command chief, said 
the rebels are determined to put out their last stand on Mount 
Patikul. He said that the rebels have ignored appeals by Muslim 
civilian officials to give up. 
  The fighting has so far claimed the lives of 35 rebels and 
seven government troops. General Soriano said the military will 
continue to pursue the Moro bandits, adding that the rebels have 
run out of ammunition. 
  The Abu Sayyaf group is being held responsible for the 
series 
of killings and kidnappings-for-ransom in Mindanao. The group 
has also opposed peace talks and a cease-fire between the 
government and the Moro National Liberation Front, which has 
kept a hands-off policy on the military offensive. 
  The military assault began early Friday morning with about 
3,000 troops backed by tanks, navy gunboats, and helicopter 
gunships launching land, sea, air raids to flush an estimated 
140 guerrillas from their mountain hideout. 
  There are still no word on Abu Sayyaf Chieftain Abdul Rajik 
Janjalani, against whom an order of capture -- dead or alive -- 
has been issued.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] People have wondered why the two-headed government 
opposed and refused to raise the issue of national 
reconciliation at the unconditional roundtable in Pyongyang. 
  Observers said the roundtable in Pyongyang ended without 
producing any significant results. People held that it was all 
because the two-headed government refused to talk about national 
reconciliation as desired by the entire Cambodian nation and 
people. 
  The goal of this unconditional roundtable was to discuss 
national reconciliation. However, the two-headed government 
under the command of the communist Vietnamese and the Western 
alliance clearly saw that the so-called unconditional roundtable 
would surely examine different aspects of the issue of national 
reconciliation. This stress on national reconciliation was a 
bitter pill for them to swallow; it was a blow to their heads at 
the roundtable. But the masses were well aware of the 
importance of national reconciliation at the roundtable. They 
saw who was good, who was bad, who wanted national 
reconciliation and peace, who continued to kindle the flames of 
war, who continued to attack others, and who were defending 
themselves. It was for this reason that the two-headed 
government refused to raise the subject of national 
reconciliation and instead brought up other aspects which 
opposed and buried national reconciliation. 
  All this once again clearly shows that the two-headed 
government does not want national reconciliation, because the 
communist Vietnamese and the alliance of Western powers do not 
want national reconciliation; this is because they oppose it and 
want only to continue the war. They are fishing in troubled 
waters and are scrambling to promote their own interests. 
  The Cambodian nation and people see clearly that it is 
necessary to join forces and carry on the struggle, pending 
national reconciliation, and fight to end the Vietnamese war of 
aggression as soon as possible. 
  The two-headed government under the command of the communist 
Vietnamese and Western alliance continues to oppose the king's 
national reconciliation initiative and kindle the flames of war 
in Cambodia. When they were leaving for the roundtable in 
Pyongyang, which was purported to be held without any 
preconditions, Prince Ranariddh, representing the American 
puppets, and Hun Sen, representing the communist Vietnamese 
puppets, repeatedly set a precondition by calling for a 
cease-fire; whereas at home the puppet General Staff in Phnom 
Penh informed all their military units that there was no 
cease-fire whatsoever and that the cease-fire announced by the 
two-headed government was just a political ploy. 
  During the roundtable on 27 May, the two categories of 
puppets under the command of the communist Vietnamese and 
Western alliance did not mention the issue of national 
reconciliation at all. On the contrary, they raised the same 
preconditions that they had regularly set before. 
  On the cease-fire issue, the party of Democratic Kampuchea 
was of the opinion that in order for the cease-fire to proceed 
correctly and effectively it should be jointly controlled by 
observation groups made up of all Cambodian parties and five 
neutral countries, to be located in central, eastern, and 
western Cambodia. However, the two categories of puppets were 
opposed to the idea of allowing neutral countries to take part 
in supervising this cease-fire. That was an intentional 
obstacle created to sabotage the national reconciliation 
roundtable in Pyongyang. 
  The majority of opinion both inside and outside the country 
clearly saw that the two-headed government under the command of 
the communist Vietnamese and Western alliance did not want 
national reconciliation and peace. They wanted only to continue 
igniting the war; so they urged their two puppets to attack the 
people and resistance forces while taking the opportunity to 
further their own strategic interests. The communist Vietnamese 
wanted to take the opportunity to bring more Vietnamese 
nationals into Cambodia and expand the size of the already over 
4 million Vietnamese immigrant population to 6, 7, 8 or 10 
million in order to demographically annex Cambodia and 
exterminate the Cambodian race. As for the two categories of 
puppets, they are too intoxicated by dollars and inebriated by 
power. They forget everything Cambodian. Instead, they are 
foolishly forcing the children of the people to go to the 
battlefields and die in their place. They will do anything so 
long as they can preserve their corrupt power and continue to 
embezzle and build up their own personal interests at the 
expense of the people and their children's lives. 
  This is an act of treason to the nation and people, an act 
of selling out the nation to foreigners. As a matter of fact, 
the two-headed government is doing everything at the command of 
the communist Vietnamese and Western alliance. They do not want 
to see Cambodia achieve national reconciliation and peace. If 
Cambodia achieved national reconciliation and became unified, it 
would affect the communist Vietnamese strategy of swallowing up 
Cambodian territory. So, the Cambodian nation and people have 
no other alternative but to continue joining hands and holding 
aloft the banner of the struggle for their own defense until 
genuine national reconciliation and peace are achieved and 
happiness brought back to the country and the national 
community, thus allowing the people to live their normal lives. 
  Do the communist Vietnamese puppets and the communist 
Vietnamese, whose desire is only to annex Cambodian territory, 
have any desire to see Cambodia achieve national reconciliation 
and peace? 
  Before he went to Pyongyang for the roundtable, puppet Hun 
Sen vociferously announced that he did not want to hold talks 
with the Khmer Rouge and did not expect any results. He said he 
went to the roundtable just to placate other people. These 
remarks show that the communist Vietnamese, the communist 
Vietnamese puppets, and the alliance have not changed their 
stance. They continue to oppose the king's national 
reconciliation plan. 
  The stance of the party of Democratic Kampuchea is well 
known 
to our nation and people. It is for peace and national 
reconciliation and it supports the king's national 
reconciliation plan. The Vietnamese puppets under the command 
of their bosses, the communist Vietnamese, have demanded that 
Democratic Kampuchea hand over the liberated zones to them and 
dissolve its army so that the communist Vietnamese and the 
alliance can control and run Cambodia as they please. More to 
the point, they have aimed at crushing the national liberation 
resistance movement to enable Vietnam to incorporate Cambodia 
into its Indochinese federation. This is part of the 
long-standing, threadbare strategy and stance of the communist 
Vietnamese; nothing has changed. For this reason, can one rely 
on the communist Vietnamese and their puppets for national 
reconciliation, national concord, and peace? No. The communist 
Vietnamese want to do away with all of us who are Cambodians in 
order to turn our Cambodian territory into a part of Vietnam. 
As for the Vietnamese puppets such as Chea Sim, Hun Sen, Sar 
Kheng, and others, they are merely elements installed in power 
by Vietnam to serve Vietnam's war of aggression, which has been 
going on since 1979. They are Vietnam's out-and-out lackeys 
serving Vietnamese interests 100 percent. They never care about 
the interests of the Cambodian nation and people. Their nature 
is Vietnamese. They only want to kill Cambodians just as the 
Vietnamese, their bosses, do. Our nation and people know the 
true nature of the Vietnamese and their puppets. We never hoped 
that they would mercifully bestow peace and national 
reconciliation on Cambodia. Hearing the aforementioned rotten 
remarks of puppet Hun Sen is more than enough. 
  Past, present, and future experiences in Cambodia and the 
world show that no one should expect aggressors to give away 
peace and independence. The peace, independence, and survival 
of any country facing aggression can be won only through the 
struggle of the people in that country. This is true for 
Cambodia. If we want to achieve peace and national 
reconciliation, our entire nation and people both in the cities 
and the countryside must join hands and wage the struggle by all 
possible means until our nation and people achieve genuine 
peace, national reconciliation, independence, and national unity.

<F P=106> [News conference by Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen </F>
at Pochentong Airport on 3 June with unidentified reporters -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Hun Sen] Ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy to 
return home today. I would like to stress that there will be no 
interpretation here, thus the foreign journalists should do 
their own interpretation. 
  I know that you must have received the statement and 
communique of the Royal Government concerning this matter. I 
also know that Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first prime 
minister, had already informed you and all our compatriots of 
the outcome of the Pyongyang meeting. I know also that our 
journalists might want to know about everything, or just a 
little more detail if not everything. This is why this 
conference is being held. I will not make a statement, but just 
spend all the time answering your questions. 
  [Reporter] After leaving Pyongyang, did you travel to any 
other countries? Did you achieve any success during your trip 
to each of those countries? 
  [Hun Sen] This trip was quite different from the previous 
ones. Someone may wonder why members of the joint delegation 
led by the National Assembly chairman and the two prime 
ministers made the trip on different planes. I must stress that 
it was because we were afraid of the risk involved if we took 
the same plane. Therefore, Samdech Chea Sim, Prince Krompreah 
Norodom Ranariddh, and I agreed to make the trip separately on 
different planes. That was how the trip was made. As for me, 
after leaving Pyongyang, I went to Beijing. There were no 
specific discussions, except visiting some places there. 
  My trip to Bangkok can be regarded as a significant blazing 
of the trail. I stopped in Bangkok on the way home as a guest 
of the Thai Foreign Ministry. I did not hold any official 
discussions with Thai officials, however. As you all know, I 
have many old friends in Bangkok. Therefore, following a period 
of tension in the relations between Cambodia and Thailand, I 
think that my stay in Bangkok can be said to have political 
significance. That is, it constituted a resumption of dialogue 
after a period of interruption. My meeting with a number of old 
friends constituted a discussion to seek mutual understanding 
and ways to solve the problems between our two countries. We 
think that all problems between our two countries can be solved 
because Thailand and Cambodia will always be neighbors. 
Therefore, we need to resolve all problems through peaceful 
means. This means that we do not want to confront several 
problems at the same time. The present problem with the Khmer 
Rouge is more than enough trouble for us. We do not want any 
problems, particularly with neighboring countries, now or in the 
future. This is because development requires not only internal 
security but stability and friendship with neighboring 
countries. This is (?the trip I made). Thank you. 
  [Reporter] You have said that you met with Thai officials. 
I still wonder whether you have discussed (?the old problems 
concerning the Khmer Rouge) with the Thai officials? 
  [Hun Sen] I must tell you that I did not hold any formal 
meetings in Bangkok. I can tell you frankly that I met 
yesterday with General Charan [Kulawanit], Thai National 
Security Council secretary general, and last night I had dinner 
with my old friend, former Prime Minister Chatchai Chunhawan who 
is currently leading an opposition party. This morning, I had a 
breakfast with General Chawalit Yongchaiyut, also an old friend, 
(?who is now) minister of the Interior. The most important 
topic we discussed was how we should solve problems in the 
future [words indistinct]. We should forget whatever happened 
in the past because that will only give us a headache. What we 
want to know is how to solve our future problems. I must tell 
you that I did not discuss the Khmer Rouge issue with any 
country, let alone Thailand. I never discuss the Khmer Rouge 
problem with any country. I will hold no discussion about the 
problem with other countries, including Thailand. This is the 
stance of Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and mine as well as 
the common stance of the National Assembly and the Royal 
Government. The Khmer Rouge issue is solely an internal concern 
for Cambodia. What I wanted to discuss was Cambodian-Thai 
relations. These relations (?include) the development of 
cooperation in economics, culture, investment, trade, and so 
forth. There are so many things to discuss concerning relations 
between the two countries. 
  [Hun Sen continues] I would like to return to your 
question on the Khmer Rouge. What is the Khmer Rouge doing now? 
They are striving to internationalize the Khmer Rouge problem. 
We should not fall into the dangerous games of the Khmer Rouge. 
Why did the Khmer Rouge refuse to meet in Phnom Penh? Why did 
they ask for the meeting to be held in Jakarta or Paris? If the 
government fell into this dangerous game, it would be tantamount 
to allowing the Khmer Rouge to destroy the outcome of the Paris 
agreement. 
  As a way out for the roundtable, however, the government 
respected and followed his majesty's advice by agreeing to meet 
at the king's palace in Pyongyang. Therefore, the Khmer Rouge 
could not internationalize its problem. Generally speaking, 
they already made a false step politically when they refused to 
join the elections and opposed the Constitution, king, and 
government which resulted from the elections. 
  Therefore, they have refused to accept the cease-fire 
because 
they made a false step politically, but they still have their 
military activities to resort to as a means of resurrecting 
their political fortunes. Therefore, I would like to stress 
once again that now or in the future, the Khmer Rouge problem is 
not an issue to be discussed with any other countries. The 
Khmer Rouge problem should be discussed within the Cambodian 
framework and might be discussed in the Cambodian National 
Assembly in the future. How do we solve the Khmer Rouge 
problem? Concerning this, I would like to stress the general 
policy of the government with regard to the Khmer Rouge issue 
[words indistinct] America, France, and all other countries, 
including the neighboring countries, such as Thailand. We will 
not discuss the Khmer Rouge issue (?with them). Thank you. 
  [Reporter] I would like to know whether you will ask the 
National Assembly to outlaw the Khmer Rouge if the roundtable on 
15 (?June) fails? 
  [Hun Sen] We need to wait for the outcome of the 15 June 
meeting. Anyway, I, Samdech Krompreah, and Samdech Chea Sim are 
feebly optimistic. Why? It is because the delegates from our 
government and National Assembly to the negotiation at the 
Chhanghsu-on Palace in Pyongyang are all competent persons who 
can make decisions. As for the Khmer Rouge, they are 
represented by Khieu Samphan. Therefore, since the leaders who 
are authorized to make decisions promptly could not solve the 
problem, can we place any hope in this roundtable working group? 
I have no hope for it. I am not optimistic about this. Prior 
to my departure (to Pyongyang), you asked whether I had any hope 
for success. I answered that I was only 0.1 percent hopeful and 
99.99 percent hopeless. That was the summit negotiation. Now 
that the coming negotiation, the coming discussion, is just at 
the level of a specialized roundtable group, I really have no 
hope for it. 
  Henceforth, we must think about what more we should do. 
Concerning this matter, I think that it is still too early for 
me to say what to do in the future [words indistinct] as in the 
football game. Sometimes, from one point to another, there 
might be a new situation. Nevertheless, how should we solve the 
Khmer Rouge issue? Do we agree to accept Cambodia as a federal 
state? 
  In Pyongyang, it was fortunate that Samdech Chea Sim and 
Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh authorized negotiation with 
Khieu Samphan. During the negotiation, I told Khieu Samphan 
that it was a very good time for us to issue a joint statement 
expressing recognition for a unified Cambodia free from 
secession and division. But it would be totally meaningless if a 
cease-fire could not be implemented, because Cambodia [words 
indistinct], not just with Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos. There 
are also borders between the government and the Khmer Rouge. 
  If the cease-fire is not implemented, the process of 
national 
reconciliation will be impossible. Will we continue to accept 
such a divided Cambodia? This is the problem. Will we allow 
the Khmer Rouge to kill people at will? This is the problem 
that we must think of. I [words indistinct]. Some people have 
blamed the government of waging a meaningless war, of kindling 
the war. But let me ask you this: Suppose the Khmer Rouge were 
mosquitos. Should we allow them to bite us, or should we use a 
mosquito net or pesticide to prevent them from biting us? 
  That is one matter. That is the government's duty. If we 
allowed the Khmer Rouge, the mosquitos, to bite people, it would 
be another matter. To protect the people from being bitten by 
the mosquitos, we must use mosquito nets or other means, such as 
pesticide, to drive away the mosquitos. The Khmer Rouge are the 
mosquitos and our people are their victims. 
  But when the Royal Government carried out its duty of 
protecting the people and [words indistinct] as stated in the 
constitution, they said the government is the warmonger, the 
belligerent, while not mentioning the Khmer Rouge killed 
thousands of our people and burned down thousands of houses. 
What should the government do in such a case? 
  The other day when I was in Sihanoukville, I told the Prince 
Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh (?and announced) that if the people, 
through a referendum, want the Royal Government's troops to 
withdraw from all the cities, then I do not know what to do. 
The Prince Krompreah and I are the commanders in chief of the 
armed forces. If the people want the armed forces to withdraw 
from Phnom Penh and all the cities so as to let the Khmer Rouge 
control all areas, I really do not know what to do. We defend 
the people because they want us to. In defense, we naturally 
cannot avoid clashing with the Khmer Rouge. Defending the 
people does not mean that we must wait until we are attacked 
first. 
  Do not forget that the constitution has defined that the 
government is duty-bound to control the entire territory without 
division. This is what I want to stress. 
  So, what should we do next? I still do not know whether to 
put the Khmer Rouge outside or inside the law or what status to 
give it. But, it is very clear that the Royal Government will 
not give up its duty of preventing the people from being 
massacred by the Khmer Rouge. We will strengthen our capability 
in protecting the people. This is our vital task. Thank you. 
  [Question by an unidentified correspondent] What do you 
[words indistinct]?. 
  [Hun Sen] There has been no change. I must emphasize also 
that yesterday, Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh met with the 
diplomats to explain the situation to them. He also expressed 
regret over the number of pessimists who see the Cambodian 
situation as being gloomy, so very gloomy that the government 
should be dissolved and a reelection held. But, as for me, I 
think that before talking about the present situation, we should 
first refer to what had happened on 3 June 1993, and what is 
happening today, 3 June 1994. We must talk about this so that 
we can clearly reflect on the situation. I am not going to talk 
about the impasse or this or that difficulties. But if we speak 
about the political situation. Today last year, we saw people 
fleeing the country, some to Bangkok and others to Vientiane, 
Vietnam, or abroad, or who were packing up and getting ready to 
flee. But today, we are together. All parties have turned from 
confrontation, politically, ideologically, and militarily, to a 
cooperation that has brought stability to Cambodia. This is 
what we must see. This situation [words indistinct]. 
  As for the Khmer Rouge problem, it depends on what 
importance 
we give them. If we give them as much value as we did in the 
past, it would be as if Cambodia is facing a civil war. I do 
not understand this. I must boast a bit that no other prime 
minister in Cambodia can remain in this position longer than Hun 
Sen, that is if we speak about history. I served as prime 
minister in the former government for eight years and six 
months. And I have been prime minister of the new government 
for a year now. No one has served as prime minister for a 
longer term than I have. I do not understand why.... the Khmer 
Rouge are not that significant, but the Khmer Rouge issue has 
been emphasized to the point as if there is a civil war in 
Cambodia. There is no civil war in Cambodia right now. The 
present war is just a destructive one waged by Khmer Rouge 
rebels against a legally elected government. 
  I [words indistinct] the situation. It is known to all that 
immediately after the signing of the Paris agreement, I was the 
only one who could cope with the (?military) situation, while 
the economic blockade continued against us. But we survived. 
We have survived all along in order to find a political 
solution. What else do we have to be afraid of now? All 
parties, all political parties which have their own armed 
forces, political and military parties have come together. All 
newly-formed political parties are joining hands except the 
Khmer Rouge. The whole world recognizes the (?Phnom Penh) 
government only and provides aid to them. So, what else must we 
be afraid of? I really do not understand this claim -- hotels 
are now unoccupied, because there are no conferences. 
  Yesterday, Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh told the 
diplomats in Phnom Penh that we have peace in 95 percent of the 
territory, while only five percent have none. Can we carry out 
development with this 95 percent peace? As I used to say, peace 
prevails in the majority of our territory at all times. As for 
war, it takes place only occasionally in some scattered areas. 
Then why is it not possible for us to carry out development? 
There is no war in Phnom Penh; fighting takes place only in 
Pailin. Why must the people in Phnom Penh be that alarmed? 
Tourism, restaurants, and so forth are in Phnom Penh, not 
Pailin. 
  Thus, the situation has not changed. It all depends on us 
whether the Khmer Rouge issue is important or not. If we just 
forget about them, they would certainly be forgotten. They are 
so notorious. The most important thing is we must forget about 
them. 
  [Hun Sen continued] I still remember in October, [changes 
thought] in November last year, Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh declared (?at this Pochentong Airport] that the Khmer 
Rouge problem was not a major issue. The major issue was the 
socioeconomic development. At that time, the Khmer Rouge were 
alarmed. Why? Because they have already died politically. 
What they are so afraid of is being forgotten. Thus, they have 
tried hard to raise the Khmer Rouge issue so that a solution 
must be found for it. To seek a solution, so that they (?can 
stage a comeback). How can they come back? They can do so by 
internationalizing the Khmer Rouge issue [words indistinct]. 
Not only have they demanded a part in the current government, 
they have also proposed a maximum political program to establish 
a new government through the dismantling of the present National 
Assembly and government. Therefore, our people and compatriots 
should consider this situation for themselves. They should 
consider whether it is necessary to dissolve the National 
Assembly and government that were born of the elections 
organized through the joint effort of the Cambodian people and 
the international community. Should they dissolve this 
government and this National Assembly to form a new government 
with Khmer Rouge participation [words indistinct]. That is what 
they should think about. 
  Again, I must stress that the Cambodian situation remains 
unchanged. It is still the same old Cambodia. It has not 
changed. Its territory is still 131,035 square kilometers. The 
Khmer Rouge remain in the same, old, and small area. I must 
emphasize also that the Khmer Rouge problem is not new. Some 
(?Cambodians) seem to have forgotten about the origins of the 
Khmer Rouge. Do not forget that the Khmer Rouge have not just 
been born. I have heard about them since I was a child. They 
have opposed the government since the time of His Royal Highness 
Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Therefore, the Khmer Rouge issue is 
not an outstanding one. The Cambodian people have known about 
it all along. Therefore, we must not give any significance to 
the issue. And we must not also [words indistinct]. But, do 
not forget that in political and legal terms, the Khmer Rouge 
are already dead. However, if we want them to be alive, they 
will be alive. If we want them to be dead, they will be dead. 
We regard their military activities only as sabotage, 
espionage, and destructive acts. These acts should not be 
regarded as civil war. This is what I want to emphasize. I 
want also to stress a few more points to avoid any 
misunderstanding that the government only looks and speaks about 
good things while avoiding the bad ones. The government has 
many problems to solve. Not only the Cambodian Government, the 
Royal Government of Cambodia, even the Japanese, French, and 
U.S. Governments have one problem after another to solve. After 
solving the employment problem for the people, they face another 
problem, the AIDS problem. Our Cambodia also has many problems 
to solve. Such problems cannot be resolved within a day, a 
month, or a year. That is too short to evaluate the ability of 
the government and the capabilities of the ministers or the 
state secretaries. By saying so, it does not mean there are no 
more possibilities for changes among some government members or 
under state secretaries. [words indistinct] can be evaluated. 
The volume of our work is so enormous while our ability is (?so 
limited). [words indistinct] is the joint efforts of all 
sectors. The National Assembly, the royal government, the armed 
forces, and people must make efforts simultaneously toward 
building a prosperous Cambodia. Thank you. 
  [Question indistinct]. 
  [Hun Sen] [passage indistinct]. Therefore, we did not set 
any preconditions for negotiations. When we reached the 
negotiating table, the government also did not regard the 
cease-fire as a precondition for (?negotiation). Although the 
cease-fire proposal was not proposed at the Pyongyang talks, the 
government still adheres to the King's formula on the coming 
roundtable in Phnom Penh. But why does the King and the Royal 
Government want a cease-fire? Because this is an urgent wish of 
the people. We must know what the people want most right now. 
It is peace. To achieve peace, it is imperative to stop 
fighting first. During the negotiations, I spoke to Mr. Khieu 
Samphan on behalf of the Prince Krompreah and Samdech Chea Sim. 
I said: Your Excellency Khieu Samphan, I have heard your 
speeches where you said we should negotiate and that if we could 
not solve the problem now, we will face not only the Khmer Rouge 
issue but more problems if someone else creates another armed 
group. 
  That was what I told him. Then the two supreme patriarchs 
and 
Venerable Patriarch Khousananda and Venerable Patriarch Mongkol 
Tepeacha also asked him repeatedly to accept the cease-fire. 
But Khieu Samphan refused. He regarded the cease-fire as part 
of the minimal policy program. He insisted on rearranging the 
Paris agreement. This is because the Paris agreement sets the 
cease-fire [words indistinct]. Therefore, with the aim of 
dumping the outcome of the Paris agreement implementation, Khieu 
Samphan has raised and termed the cease-fire issue as being in 
the minimal policy program. 
  That is a contradictory stance, though not between the Royal 
Government and the Khmer Rouge. Rather, it is the Khmer Rouge's 
stance (?in opposing) the King. The Royal Government and the 
National Assembly support the King's proposal for the cease-fire 
to begin at noon on 15 June. But the Khmer Rouge have opposed 
it. This is what I want to stress. 
  [Question indistinct]. 
  [Hun Sen] I want to tell you that foreign aid has nothing to 
do with the negotiations between the Cambodians. It is 
imperative to clearly distinguish the aspects of this matter. 
The problem of the Khmer Rouge is solely an internal affair of 
Cambodia. The current circumstances are different from the time 
prior to the implementation of the Paris agreement. Then, the 
Paris agreement instructed all warring factions to stop 
procuring military aid. But today, according to the third phase 
defined in the Paris agreement, with or without the Khmer Rouge, 
this government is fully entitled to accept foreign aid, 
including economic, financial, technical, and military 
assistance. Therefore, these two aspects are not linked. I must 
stress that for (?Cambodia), the Royal Government dares to even 
do the following. 
  Although the Royal Government is entitled by law to foreign 
military aid or to buy arms from foreign countries, to persuade 
the Khmer Rouge to agree with the cease-fire, the Royal 
Government has agreed to: 
  1. After the inter-Cambodian cease-fire overseeing 
commission is set up, this commission may monitor the presence 
of foreign troops in Cambodia. 
  I told Khieu Samphan: I understand what you are up to. You 
keep talking about the presence of foreign troops, meaning 
Vietnamese troops. Therefore, if you suspect that foreign 
troops are still present, in addition to monitoring the 
cease-fire, you should go and look for them. 
  That is the first point. 
  2. We dare to do this even -- that is, if you accept the 
cease-fire, the government will stop accepting foreign military 
aid for the time being to create an atmosphere of trust. That 
is also part of the King's proposal. The King said he has not 
yet discussed this with the Royal Government, but the Royal 
government would like to voice support for this proposal. That 
is for a permanent cease-fire to be observed first until the 
Khmer Rouge forces are integrated into the Royal Government's 
army. Only then will we arrange to use the military aid to 
strengthen Cambodia's national defense capability. Despite all 
that, the Khmer Rouge still disagreed. 
  I must reiterate that the Royal Government has the full 
right 
to accept all foreign aid. [passage indistinct]. But we must 
accept the aid for national development and for consolidating 
our national defense capability. We are entitled to accept it. 
No one can say we should not get it. [passage indistinct]. 
  This third step in the Paris agreement does not forbid 
Cambodia from accepting foreign military aid to strengthen the 
capability to defend Cambodia's [words indistinct] territorial 
integrity. Thank you. Now I think that this is enough 
explanation for you. 
  [Question by an unidentified correspondent] [words 
indistinct] that there is little hope in settling the Khmer 
Rouge problem through peaceful means [words indistinct] military 
means to settle the Khmer Rouge problem. How much confidence do 
you have in the capability of our government troops to put an 
end to the Khmer Rouge threat? If you [words indistinct]. 
  [Hun Sen] At first we believed [words indistinct] if the 
Khmer Rouge problem cannot be solved through political means, 
what should we do? As I said just now, we regard the Khmer 
Rouge as the mosquitoes -- so, should we let the mosquitoes bite 
us or should we use a mosquito-net to prevent them from biting 
us or use pesticide or charcoal smoke to chase them away? That 
is the point. The duty of the government as authorized by the 
constitution is to defend the nation's independence, 
sovereignty, and territorial integrity. (passage indistinct]. I 
cannot evaluate the government troops' capability. But, one 
very clear point is that the Khmer Rouge can in no way eliminate 
or topple the government. That is one thing. Another is that 
the Khmer Rouge will not be able to expand their territory. I 
can assure you of this. To answer when we can get rid of all 
the Khmer Rouge forces, I can only say that it does not depend 
solely on military means. A bomb that is capable of causing the 
widest destruction is development in the social and economic 
domains. This is what we should resort to in order to solve the 
problem. The use of arms cannot solve the problem. The lessons 
from Malaysia and Thailand in disbanding the communist parties 
do not the involve the use of arms. It is true is the duty of 
the (?troops) to use arms to protect the citizens. But rural 
development and all-round economic development, eradicating 
social injustice, and the elimination of corruption are the 
important matters for the Royal Government. If these problems 
cannot be resolved, we will face not only the Khmer Rouge issue 
but more problems if someone else starts creating another armed 
group. 
  Therefore, we should now mobilize all the efforts of our 
national forces and international assistance for social and 
economic development -- a most powerful bomb for destroying not 
only the Khmer Rouge but all other things, including corruption, 
which has caused social inertia. This is [words indistinct] not 
only the military and police forces. 
  [Question by an unidentified correspondent] [words 
indistinct] do you still want to negotiate with the Khmer Rouge? 
  [Hun Sen] It is clearly recognized across the world that Hun 
Sen is the advocator of negotiation. Because of this, during my 
term as the prime minister of the former State of Cambodia, I 
went everywhere to hold negotiations. The success of 
negotiations has already been recognized by the Cambodian people 
and the international community. His Excellency Sieng Lapresse 
[Information Ministry's spokesman], who was also in the 
negotiations, knows I have been a tireless negotiator. But now 
that I am fulfilling my duty as the prime minister of the King, 
I will follow whatever advice that is given by the King. But if 
asked whether I like it, I must say I do not. Why? Because I 
know that it is useless. When the King appealed for a 
cease-fire, the Khmer Rouge retorted that the cease-fire was a 
scheme of the aggressors. The Khmer Rouge charged the King's 
advice as being a scheme of the aggressors. In seeing that, I 
think there is no way to talk to them. [passage indistinct]. 
But if the King so wishes, I will [passage indistinct]. 
  Now I want to talk about the harmony between Prince 
Krompreah 
and myself. We get along very well. This is why I have never 
[passage indistinct]. Some newspapers, I say some newspapers 
and am not going to say which ones, have said that the FUNCINPEC 
[National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, 
and Cooperative Cambodia] has breached its promise. Leaflets 
have also been distributed asking the FUNCINPEC to end its 
meaningless war. I said nothing about this. The Prince 
Krompreah has also said nothing. I have given support to all 
the efforts he made [words indistinct]. This is because I know 
and understand it well. Maybe Mr. Khieu Samphan does not want 
to negotiate with me. Thus, it will be useless for me to 
negotiate. If he wants to negotiate, then come to Phnom Penh. 
But why does he not want to come to Phnom Penh? It is not 
because it is inconvenient. [passage indistinct]. Why does he 
not want to come? It is because he wants to internationalize 
the Khmer Rouge issue. [passage indistinct].

  [Text] At the invitation of the prime minister of the 
Federation of Russia and Governments of Ukraine and Kazakhstan, 
Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and his wife will pay 
official visits to these countries from July 8-20. It is the 
first official visit by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet to these 
states since the collapse of the former Soviet Union. The prime 
minister is accompanied by Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam; 
minister of the Government Office; minister of energy; minister 
of science, technology, and environment; and 31 Vietnamese 
businessmen. The prime minister's trip will start in Kiev and 
then Almaty and Moscow. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet will be 
received by presidents of all these states and Vietnam will sign 
with Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan agreements, treaties, and 
joint communiques on cooperation. 
  Relations between Vietnam and Russia, Ukraine, and 
Kazakhstan 
have been established for a long time. After the collapse of 
the former Soviet Union, Vietnam and these states try to 
maintain these relations. Cooperation has continued to develop 
in the fields of energy and oil and gas. Vietnam also has 
cooperated with Russia in other areas, such as transportation 
and agriculture. However, two-way trade turnover between 
Vietnam and Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan was still at a 
modest level. The turnover with Russia was $300 million and 
with Ukraine $330 million. During the trip, further cooperation 
will be developed in accordance with their potentials. 
  Meanwhile, relations between Vietnam and Germany are 
developing strongly. The visit to Vietnam by Minister of 
Cooperation and Development of Germany Carl-Dieter Spranger at 
the end of May made considerable contribution. The development 
of relations between the two countries does not reflect 
Germany's official development aid -- ODA -- to Vietnam, but 
Germany's efforts are clear in increasing its aid to both north 
and south Vietnam equally. In 1990, Germany granted aid to 
Vietnam 12 million Deutche marks, in 1991 the amount of aid from 
Germany increased to DM27 million, in 1992 it was 49 million, 
and 1993 63 million. These figures prove that over the past 
four years relations between the two countries have achieved 
important steps which were not obvious in previous years. The 
main reasons are the changing and development in Vietnam itself 
because of renovation.

  [Text] The National Assembly Office issued Communique No. 
10, which indicated that this morning, the National Assembly 
deputies studied, exchanged views, and contributed views to a 
number of clauses and sections of the revised draft laws on the 
organization of people's councils and people's committees and on 
the election of people's councillors. 
  This afternoon, the National Assembly met in the conference 
hall under the direction of National Assembly Vice Chairman 
Nguyen Ha Phan to debate on the draft law on local investment 
promotion. 
  Altogether, 14 deputies aired their views. The deputies 
were: Le Xuan Tung of Hanoi, Tran Du Lich of Ho Chi Minh City, 
Nguyen Ngoc Tran of An Giang, Nguyen Dinh Giao of Quang Ninh, 
Hoang Minh Thang of Quang Nam-Da Nang, Phan Lam Phuong of Quang 
Binh, Lam Phung Vien of Soc Trang, Nguyen Duy Anh of Lam Dong, 
Nguyen Thu Ha of Thai Binh, Le Thi Thuy of Nghe An, Do Quoc Hung 
of Ba Ria-Vung Tau, Tran Chu Toan of Gia Lai, Nguyen Nhieu Coc 
of Hoa Binh, and Le Thi Thanh Liem of Ben Tre. 
  In expressing their views, the deputies concured with the 
names of the laws and with the necessity to promulgate them. 
They also maintained that once adopted by the National 
Assembly, the law on local investment promotion will create the 
legal basis and favorable conditions for the people to have a 
sense of security while investing in production and business 
operations, thus contributing to making the goal of making the 
people rich and the country powerful come true. 
  The deputies focused on key issues as follows: objectives 
and areas that need to be amended, role of state business 
establishments, measures to ensure and support investment, 
problems concerning the establishment of an investment support 
fund and investment credit gurantee, types of occupations and 
areas of activities that need investment privileges, and state 
management over investment promotion. 
  Tomorrow, 7 June, the National Assembly will continue to 
meet 
in the conference hall to debate the draft law on local 
investment promotion.

investment, monetary stabilization, and the containment of 
inflation are important and pressing issues that should be 
resolved by the country in the last six months of the year. 
  Comrade Phan Van Khai, member of the party Central Committee 
Political Bureau, deputy prime minister, and chairman of the 
Central Financial and Monetary Council, was speaking on this 
subject in an interview with the Vietnamese New Agency. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai gave some insights into 
the progress made in the financial and monetary field during the 
first few months of the year. 
  Speaking on attracting sources of foreign capital, the 
difficulties to be encountered in the financial and monetary 
field in the last six months of the year, and the approaches to 
be taken to balance the budget and muster capital for 
development requirements, Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai 
said: The most effective approach will remain increased revenue 
collection along with economizing on spending. 
  The national conference of the tax sector held in the middle 
of last May evaluated the potential for increasing various items 
of domestic tax and levies by 10 percent as compared with the 
plan for the first half of the year. If the potential for the 
Customs Sector to increase its revenue collection is taken into 
account, we will be able to exceed the target by 15 percent. 
The feasibility for achieving this relies on efforts to exploit 
the latent potential for increased production and expanded 
circulation, and for the enforcement of tax laws and the code of 
discipline for budgetary contributions. An important source for 
increased revenue collection is export tax which, accounting for 
nearly one-fourth of the total budget revenue, is a measure 
aimed at ensuring adequate domestic production. 
  Along with readjusting the export-import tax chart in 
accordance with a resolution adopted by the National Assembly 
Standing Committee in late March, it is necessary to step up 
antismuggling activities more intensively. Not only will we 
have to fight smuggling at entry-exit points but we will also 
have to conduct inspections to obtain back taxes from goods 
which have been illicitly imported without payment of taxes. We 
must carry out our activities resolutely with appropriate and 
open steps so the people can supervise the leasing of land or 
the transfer of land-use rights as well as the shifting of the 
state-administered housing fund to business. By doing so, not 
only will we be able to generate a huge source of revenue for 
the budget, but we will be also able to ensure that these assets 
are managed and used more satisfactorily, thus overcoming a 
situation in which assets are gnawed off or abused.

<F P=106> [Directive of the Central Committee Secretariat on some </F>
problems concerning woman cadre-related work in the new 
situation] 
  [Text] The party Central Committee Secretariat has issued 
the Directive on a Number of Problems Concerning Woman 
Cadre-Related Work in the New Situation. The directive takes 
into account the growth, great contributions, competence, 
political quality, and good fulfillment of tasks in the new 
situation by the contingent of women cadres. 
  However, the percentage of women cadres at leadership and 
management agencies remains low and tends to decrease. This 
situation is caused, first of all, by the fact that party 
committee echelons, administrative organs at all levels, and 
sectors do not fully realize the role and capabilities of women 
cadres; they lack practical policies and measures to foster, 
train, utilize, and promote women cadres; and they let 
themselves be affected seriously by the tendency to look down 
upon women cadres. No close and constant efforts are made to 
direct the implementation of woman cadre-related work. Some 
women cadres still are resigned to their fate and lack the 
determination to effect changes for the better. 
  To guarantee the good implementation of woman cadre-related 
work in the new situation, the Secretariat requests all echelons 
and sectors to carry out satisfactorily a number of tasks as 
follows: 
  1. Continued efforts are needed to help cadres and party 
members improve their knowledge of the party's concepts on women 
cadres, thus making everyone understand profoundly the Political 
Bureau's Resolution 04-NQ/TW dated 12 July 1993 regarding the 
need to "strengthen and renovate woman cadre-related work in the 
new situation." It is important to increase the percentage of 
women cadres in charge of state and socioeconomic management 
agencies because this move really helps guarantee equality and 
democracy for women. Furthermore, it creates conditions for 
women to bring into full play their talents and wisdom and 
enhance their social role. It is necessary to do away with the 
bad practice of looking down upon women and of adopting a too 
strict and narrow-minded attitude when it comes to evaluating 
and promoting women cadres. 
  At the same time, it is necessary to take into full account 
women cadres' characteristics, show understanding to women 
cadres, and provide them with practical assistance so they can 
effect changes for the better. The support and encouragement of 
each woman cadre's family is also important in this regard. 
  Women cadres themselves should work actively to overcome 
difficulties, improve their quality and capabilities in all 
domains, remain self-assertive in the performance of duties, and 
know how to combine family affairs with social activities in a 
harmonious manner. 
  2. It is necessary to implement woman cadre planning and 
woman cadre resources development, training, and improvement. 
  We need to work out measures to train, foster, and utilize 
women workers in general and women cadres in particular. As an 
immediate objective, all echelons and sectors from the central 
down to grassroots levels must implement woman cadre planning. 
  Early steps must be taken to determine sectors and areas of 
activities suitable for women to develop their strong points, as 
well as leadership and management positions that need women 
cadres, and henceforth, work out woman cadre resources 
development, training, improvement, and utilization plans. 
  It is necessary to discover young talent and work out 
adequate plans to help them train and improve themselves so they 
can be promoted and put to work at an early date. 
  Due attention must be given to the training of women cadres 
in charge of scientific-technological, economic, legislative, 
administrative, and state management work, as well as to women 
cadres belonging to different ethnic groups and religions or 
coming from deep or remote areas. 
  Training schools and classes run by the party, state, and 
mass organizations must establish an appropriate ratio of female 
trainees to male trainees when admitting new students. These 
schools must introduce knowledge on sexual differentiation to 
their training curriculum. They should adopt training and 
refresher training forms suitable for women cadres such as 
organizing their courses in different grassroots, areas, and 
regions; breaking their training program into short sessions; 
and creating favorable conditions for female students to attend 
their training. 
  3. The percentage of women cadres in all levels and sectors 
must be increased. 
  The placement and promotion of women must conform with the 
planning and they must be trained to meet the standards required 
by their job description. 
  On the basis of the current number of female employees, 
measures must be applied to deploy more women cadres to 
positions suitable to their abilities and work requirements. 
  The number of female cadres, including nonparty member 
cadres, from the grassroots to central levels must be increased. 
In fact: 
  -- The number of female members and female standing members 
in party committees at all levels must be increased. 
  -- The number of women cadres in state organs, elected 
bodies 
(the National Assembly and people's committees), mass 
organizations, and fatherland fronts must be increased. 
  -- The number of women cadres must be a corresponding 
percentage of the total work force in state industries and 
enterprises with many female workers (more than 30 percent); 
sectors which have functions and duties related to women's 
issues; and state organs in charge of organizational work, 
cadre-related work, planning, and social welfare. These groups 
must have women holding key leading positions in all levels. 
  4. Policies must be established to create favorable working 
conditions for women and encourage them to develop their 
abilities. 
  Women-related policies must be established to create 
conditions for women to accomplish their maternity duty together 
with their social function. 
  It is necessary to provide allowances for kindergarten 
services for woman cadres attending training courses. Policies 
should be established to encourage sectors and production and 
business enterprises to employ more female workers. 
  Female talents in schools and in all activities should be 
given particular attention. Gifted female scientists and 
skillful female managers must be given priority in employment; 
when it is necessary, they can extend their retirement age to 
60, the same age as their male colleagues. 
  It is necessary to encourage and mobilize all social forces 
to improve living conditions, health care service, child care, 
and household work so women can have better conditions to relax, 
entertain, study to improve their knowledge, and perform their 
work. 
  5. Party development tasks for women must be accelerated. 
  All party organs must regularly propagandize, foster, and 
admit more members from amongst female youths and workers in all 
sectors, levels, and production and business enterprises, 
especially in ethnic, isolated, and religious areas. The 
admission of potential female party members for cadre planning 
work must be given special attention. 
  It is necessary to understand special characteristics of 
female party members in order to assign them proper work. 
Wherever there is a high percentage of female members leaving 
the party, it is necessary to analyze the causes before adopting 
measures to overcome that situation. 
  6. Organizing and instructions for the implementation of 
this 
directive. 
  Party committees at all levels, party affairs organs, youth 
unions, and leaders of all sectors need to thoroughly understand 
this directive, disseminate it to cadres and members of 
grassroots party organs, and outline programs and planning for 
its successful execution. 
  In cadre-organizational organs, a sector specializing in 
women cadres must be set up to help the party committee 
satisfactorily carry out this work. 
  The party affairs organs are entrusted with the duty to 
direct state organs to institutionalize this directive into 
practical policies and guidelines. 
  The party organizational committees, party propaganda 
committees, youth unions, and women's unions are responsible for 
helping party committees at all levels to guide, keep watch, 
motivate, and check on the implementation of this directive.

<F P=106> [Interview with Comrade Do Van An, secretary of Son La Party </F>
Committee and head of Son La National Assembly Deputy Delegation 
by an unidentified radio correspondent; place and date not given 
-- recorded] 
  [Summary] [Correspondent] "Dear Comrade: Recently, the 
government presented a report on the national socioeconomic 
development situation in the first six months of 1994. On the 
basis of the report's general assessment, what can you say about 
prominent issues of economic development in Son La and its 
development direction in the future?" 
  [Do Van An] Our Son La National Assembly deputy delegation 
unanimously agrees with the government report presented by 
Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai to the National Assembly. 
Our national economic situation has started to improve with 
more positive factors to help us emerge from the crisis. After 
Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi's visit to Son La, the 
province started to improve its economy with a quicker changing 
pace from an autarkic economy to a commodity production economy. 
Presently, Son La enjoys great potential in industrial trees, 
fruit trees, and livestock breeding. To further increase its 
economy, Son La needs more capital, greater energy resource, and 
better transportation so that it can process its forestry and 
agricultural products. If we can solve these problems, I 
believe that the transformation rate from autarkic economy to 
commodity economy in Son La Province will be higher and 
stronger, leading to quicker success in our undertaking of 
starvation elimination and poverty alleviation. 
  [Correspondent] "So Son La has realized its development 
direction. Regarding the aforementioned problems, apart from 
assistance from the central level and different sectors and 
levels, what measures have been taken by the province to 
overcome these difficulties?" 
  [Do Van An] Realities prove that in the past three years, 
the 
Son La Party Committee and people have heightened their 
self-reliant spirit. With very little capital for medium and 
long-term investment, Son La has used its local budget to 
provide loans to the public to improve local production. The 
local people have invested much of their labor into the 
production. I consider this a great contribution from the 
public. 
  [Correspondent] "What do you think about the construction of 
the national electricity transmission line to solve the energy 
problem?" 
  [Do Van An] "The energy problem is a concern of our party 
committee and people. We are proud that Son La is one of the 
two provinces that greatly contribute to the Hoa Binh energy 
resources. We are glad that the 500-kilovolt transmission line 
has brought electricity from Hoa Binh to Ho Chi Minh City with a 
great contribution from people in Son La and Hoa Binh Provinces. 
However, we are still worried that so far, we still have pay a 
very high electricity rate because our power stations are run 
with diesel generators. Therefore, the production development 
is very limited. The comrade general secretary, during his last 
trip to the province, realized that this is not reasonable. We 
expect that the national electricity system will reach Son La 
early. It may be very exciting for me to find out that the two 
provinces of Son La and Hoa Binh will be totally electrified 
first. It think this is fair." 
  [Correspondent] "Thank you, comrade."

  [Text] At 1800 sharp on 5 June, the north-south 500-kv 
power transmission network was put into operation. 
  A get-together of those units engaged in the construction of 
the north-south 500-kv power transmission network was solemnly 
held at the Thong Nhut conference hall in Ho Chi Minh City to 
welcome the the transmission of electricity from the north to Ho 
Chi Minh City and other southern provinces. 
  Attending the get-together were Prime Miniter Vo Van Kiet; 
Deputy Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong; Ho Chi Minh City Party 
Committee Secretary Vo Tran Chi; Minister of Energy Thai Phung 
Ne; Minister of Science, Technology, and Environment Dang Huu;

equipment for the project; and representatives of many units in 
charge of surveying, designing, and building the north-south 
500-kv transmission network. 
  Deputy Prime Miniter Tran Duc Luong gave a speech at the 
get-together, affirming that the 500-kv project is the backbone 
of the national power grid. The successful construction of this 
project will be enshrined forever in history as a beautiful 
landmark and a starting symbol for the process of national 
industrialization and modernization. The successful 
construction of this project has left us with valuable lessons 
on the mustering and mobilization of the strength of the entire 
country and of the international cooperation in the new system 
of the renovation stage for the purpose of building our country 
into an increasingly pleasant-looking and beautiful one. 
  The deputy prime minister warmly cited the achievements of 
those units and individuals engaged in the construction of the

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Energy Thai Phung Ne by </F>
unidentified VNA corrrespondent; place and date not given] 
  [Summary] [Correspondent]: "As people around the country 
are very interested in hearing about progress on the north-south 
500-kv power line, could you review the status of the project?" 
  [Thai Phung Ne] "Testing is the final phase of construction 
for the power network before it goes into operation. According 
to a schedule drawn up by three parties, namely Vietnam; the 
(Merland Guerain) company of France, which provides transformer 
stations; and the PPI-SECVI (of Australia), a technical 
consultant that participates in supervision of construction, the 
test period will last for about two months. 
  "The testing program officially began 5 April, exactly two 
years after the beginning of construction. I cannot recall 
everything we have done in the past month because the testing 
involves huge amounts of work." I can only recall the most 
essential activities, which include finishing the inspection, 
testing, and adjustment of the entire 1,487 km of the 500-kv 
power transmission line; completing the inspection and testing 
of equipment at all five transformer stations and the National 
Power Regulator Center; completing testing of measuring 
instruments and switches at the Hoa Binh, Ha Tinh and Danang 
transformer stations; measuring the electrical resistance of the 
Danang-Ha Tinh-Hoa Binh, Danang-Play Cu, Play Cu-Krong No, and 
Krong No-Phu Lam microwave transmission lines; and 
test-connecting the 15-kv power network with the 500-kv power 
network. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, were there any problems with 
the test-run? 
  [Thai Phung Ne] "Generally speaking, the results of the 
test-run were good." 
  [Correspondent] "Mr. Minister, everyone is waiting for the 
moment when the switch is turned on, carrying electricity from 
the north to the south. Could you tell us exactly when that 
will happen?" 
  [Thai Phung Ne] "As I said earlier, two months of testing 
are 
needed before the power transmission lines are connected 
officially. I have asked the PPI-SECVI Consultant Company (of 
Australia) and other testing units to focus their greatest 
efforts on finishing the remaining testing work promptly." 
  It is necessary to point out here that the remaining work is 
very extensive. I have asked the National Electricity Regulator 
Center and the PPI-SECVI Consultant Company (of Australia) to 
draw up an operating plan for various power stations in order to 
ensure a smooth supply of electricity to the national power grid.

<F P=106> [By Saowalakk Phumyaem] </F>
  [Excerpt] Trials of an anti-Aids vaccine produced by a U.S. 
company will begin on 30 volunteers today, the first such tests 
in Thailand, a senior Red Cross official said. 
  Prof Praphan Phanuphak, director of the society's Aids 
programme, said the volunteers will be inoculated with a 
synthetic protein which resembles part of the HIV virus and 
should generate an immunity to the disease. 
  Praphan said the UBI-1 candidate vaccine is produced by 
United Biomedical Inc in the United States. The vaccine has been 
tested experimentally in China and Australia, and on animals and 
about 100 people in the United States. 
  The human trials in Thailand, the first of a four planned 
programmes in developing countries, are under Prahpan's 
direction, with supervision by Thai Red Cross Society 
secretary-general Paen Wannamethi and Prof Supphawat Chutiwong, 
dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Chulalongkon University. 
  The World Health Organization has approved tests of UBI-1 in 
four developing countries -- Thailand, Brazil, Uganda and Rwanda. 
  Praphan said experiments overseas had shown the vaccine can 
build a resistance to infection by the HIV virus, the forerunner 
of Aids. 
  The production process for the vaccine was easy and 
inexpensive. 
  The programme has been approved by an ethics committee of 
the 
Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkon University, and an Aids 
research committee at the Public Health Ministry. 
  He said the trials are intended to determine if the vaccine 
can generate anti-bodies in the blood or a protein that can 
destroy the Aids virus in a test tube. 
  HIV-free volunteers were selected in April from applicants 
aged 20-50 years old whose behaviour patterns mean they are not 
prone to HIV infection. Pregnant women were not selected. 
  The volunteers, 25 men and 5 women, will be vaccinated three 
times in the first, second and sixth months. Their immune system 
will be checked eight months after the first vaccination. 
  Praphan said the volunteers will be divided into two groups 
of 15 each. Only 12 will be inoculated with UBI-1 candidate 
vaccine and the rest will get a placebo. 
  Some of the 12 will receive 100 microgrammes of the vaccine 
and the others 500 microgrammes, to enable a comparison of the 
effects. 
  Those who receive the vaccine will all test "positive", but 
they will not actually be infected with HIV and hospitals could 
identify the difference. 
  The volunteers are being provided with cards stating that 
their blood will test positive for two years after the end of 
the experiment. 
  He said half of the 30 volunteers have a bachelor or masters 
degree and 70-80 per cent are frequent blood donors. About half 
of them have already donated their bodies to medical research 
once they die. 
  The volunteers are from varying occupations. They include 
taxi drivers, soldiers, police, engineers, nurses, teachers, 
lawyers and a Buddhist monk. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Labor and Social Welfare Minister Phaithun 
Kaeothong, who is leading a 15-member delegation of the 
government sector comprised of representatives of employees and 
employers, left Bangkok last night to participate in the 81st 
International Labor Organization [ILO] Conference in Geneva, 
Switzerland, scheduled to be held 6 to 23 June. 
  The 81st ILO meeting also coincides with the celebration of 
the 75th founding anniversary of the ILO and the 50th 
anniversary of the Declaration of Philadelphia. More 
importantly, the Thai tripartite committee will introduce 
Thailand's Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare to some 175 
participating countries at the meeting so they will know that 
Thailand now has an official government agency to take direct 
responsibility for the care of its laborers. 
  Regarding the main agenda, apart from consideration of 
various organization budgets and projects, there also will be a 
report presented by the ILO director general. The main contents 
of the report will be about the role of the organization in 
creating social justice and the organization's activities. 
  The discussion also will touch upon the issues of part-time 
jobs, safety and health of workers in the mining industry, role 
of the private sector in market promotion, as well as a review 
of the Declaration on measures against racial discrimination in 
South Africa. 
  The ASEAN group will submit to the ILO its consensus on 
international work standards and the linkage of the issues of 
social role with the international trading system. The ASEAN 
group feels that the linking of work standards to the trading 
system will adversely affect the economies of the developing 
countries rather than benefit them. In addition, ASEAN also 
feels that the ILO should improve international standards to 
make it suitable for modern times.

  [Text] Cambodia has expressed its wish to participate in 
the Asean Regional Forum (ARF) scheduled to be held in July, 
according to a Thai Foreign Ministry statement. 
  The ministry said Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom 
Sirivut conveyed the wish during a meeting with his Thai 
counterpart, Prasong Sunsiri, at last weekend's Non-Aligned 
Movement meeting in Egypt. 
  Prasong told Prince Sirivut he would forward Cambodia's wish 
to other Asean foreign ministers for consideration. Asean 
includes Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore and 
Thailand. 
  Cambodia will attend the 27th Asean Ministerial meeting on 
July 22-23 as a special guest. The meeting will be followed by 
the ARF meetings on July 25 and a Post Ministerial Conference on 
July 26-28 in which Asean's dialogue partners will participate. 
  The ARF will set aside three hours for participants to 
discuss security issues that they consider significant for 
regional peace and stability. 
  Participants in the forum are Asean members plus Laos, 
Vietnam and Papua New Guinea as observers. Asean's dialogue 
partners, which include the United States, Australia, Canada and 
Japan, will also participate. China and Russia will attend as 
Asean's consultative partners. 
  It is still uncertain whether Cambodia's participation will 
be possible as participants in the forum should have formal 
status in Asean, according to an earlier agreement among senior 
Asean officials. Senior Asean officials and representatives of 
prospective ARF participants met last month for the final ARF 
preparation. 
  Cambodia has not acceded to the treaty of Amity and 
Cooperation in Southeast Asia, a prerequisite for Southeast 
Asian nations to become Asean members. Vietnam and Laos both 
acceded to the treaty before being accorded observer status. 
  Prince Sirivut had previously expressed his country's 
interest in joining the ARF but later dropped the idea. During 
his visit to Cambodia earlier this year, Prasong Sunsiri 
suggested Cambodia write a formal letter expressing interest in 
the ARF, but the suggestion was not taken up. 
  Cambodia, which now has a democratically-elected government 
as a result of UN-organized elections last May, has not yet been 
accorded any status within Asean. Despite this, the country was 
invited at short notice to attend the 26th Asean meetings in 
Singapore. 
  King Norodom Sihanouk has said Cambodia at this stage wants 
to be a non-aligned country and will consider joining Asean at a 
later date. 
  In Egypt, Prasong also met with his Vietnamese counterpart, 
Nguyen Manh Cam.

  [Text] Thai Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong 
Sunsiri, in his position as chairman of the ASEAN Standing 
Committee, held a meeting with ASEAN foreign ministers on 1 June 
while in Cairo to attend the 11th meeting of the Nonaligned 
Movement foreign ministers. They discussed preparations for the 
first ARF [Asian Regional Forum], to be held in Thailand in 
July. The meeting acknowledged the convening of the ASEAN 
foreign ministers meeting and the meeting with dialogue partners 
in Bangkok in the same month. They also discussed the meeting 
between ASEAN and the European Union in Germany in September and 
the ASEAN summit in Bangkok in 1995. 
  Also on 1 June, Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam 
met with the Thai foreign minister to discuss preparations for 
the ARF. Vietnam is pleased to have the opportunity to attend 
the ARF and is ready to contribute to a successful meeting. The 
SRV foreign minister felt that the agenda of the first meeting 
of the ARF should be wide ranging and emphasize confidence 
building. The meeting should also discuss Vietnam's ASEAN 
membership. On this issue, the Thai foreign minister felt that 
Vietnam will eventually become an ASEAN member, saying how soon 
this happens depends on Vietnam's readiness. 
  The Thai foreign minister said Thai-Vietnamese relations 
have 
improved considerably, as evidenced by cooperation in many 
areas, especially in the economic sphere. Both sides will 
persuade Thai businessmen to invest more in Vietnam. The 
Vietnamese foreign minister expressed a wish to receive more 
visits by Thai royal family members. Princess Maha Chakri 
Sirinthon and Princess Kanlani Watthana already paid visits to 
Vietnam. 
  The Thai foreign minister informed his Vietnamese 
counterpart 
of the recent release of 14 Vietnamese fishermen from Thailand. 
He expressed hope that Vietnam will release Thai fishermen now 
detained in Vietnam at an appropriate time. 
  Regarding the meeting between the Thai foreign minister and 
his Lao and Cambodian counterparts, Lao Deputy Foreign Minister 
Souban Salitthilat called on the Thai foreign minister while in 
Cairo to attend the NAM foreign ministers meeting. They agreed 
that there are currently no problems in relations between their 
countries. On the 13,000 Lao refugees remaining at Ban Na Pho 
camp and 7,000 others at Phanat Nikhom camp, the Lao deputy 
foreign minister, who is in charge of the Lao refugee issue, 
said a meeting will be held between officials of Thailand, Laos, 
and UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Chiang Saen District, 
Chiang Rai Province, on 19 June. The Lao official also said the 
Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge has helped boost relations and 
contacts between the two countries and speeded up travel between 
the two countries. There has been no problem arising from the 
bridge. 
  Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut also 
called 
on the Thai foreign minister. He informed his Thai counterpart 
about the Cambodian roundtable in Pyongyang, saying another 
round is scheduled on 15 June in Phnom Penh. The Thai foreign 
minister said that it might too optimistic to expect success in 
only one meeting. Success may eventually materialize in future 
meetings. He reiterated the Thai Government policy which 
recognizes the legitimate Cambodian Government and intends to be 
a good neighbor of Cambodia. He said the Thai Government and 
armed forces will not provide any support to the Khmer Rouge. 
He expressed the view that Cambodia will not be able to solve 
its problem without earnest cooperation by all Cambodian 
factions. 
  The Cambodian foreign minister informed his Thai counterpart 
that King Norodom Sihanouk had approved credentials for the 
Cambodian ambassador to Thailand, (Chang Roland). The new 
ambassador now is waiting to receive credentials from the king. 
The Thai and Cambodian foreign ministers agreed that they 
should meet regularly -- both formally or privately -- in 
Bangkok or in Phnom Penh.

  [Text] An Iranian arrested as a prime suspect in connection 
with the foiled terrorist truck bomb plot in March was yesterday 
picked out from a police line-up by six of the seven witnesses 
present, police said. 
  Meanwhile, Police Director General Police General Prathin 
Santipraphop has issued an order dated June 3 for police to 
intensively monitor people suspected to have links with 
international terrorist groups and to tighten security for 
embassies, certain schools, and other key establishments 
following the arrest. 
  Six witnesses were brought one at a time for the 
identification at Lumpini police station and all of them 
independently singled out Hossein Shahriari Far from among seven 
Middle Eastern men presented by police, said South Bangkok 
Metropolitan Police Deputy Commander Police Colonel Dutsadi 
Chaiyanam. 
  The seventh witness, the owner of the company from which the 
truck used to carry the explosives was rented, did not 
participate, saying he had not dealt directly with the man who 
rented the vehicle, but let his employees handle the matter. 
  Far, 26, was arrested last Friday in Hat Yai district, 
Songkhla Province, on charges of murder and illegal possession 
of explosives. Three other Iranians are being held for 
questioning in the same case. 
  The arrest was made more than 10 weeks after police found a 
metric ton of deadly explosive mixture made from C4 plastic 
explosive and ammonium nitrate-based fertilizer in a water tank 
on the back of a six-wheel truck abandoned less than a kilometer 
from the Israeli Embassy after the driver hit a taxi motorcycle. 
  The vehicle rental company employee who delivered the truck 
to the renters was killed and dumped into the explosive-filled 
tank. 
  The taxi motorcyclist who was engaged in the road accident 
that fortunately averted the planned sabotage yesterday 
identified Far as the driver of the truck which hit his 
motorcycle, said Dutsadi.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Overhauling Thai Politics Towards Reforms"] </F>
  [Text] There has been growing support for the call that a 
constitution drafting committee be established to write a new 
constitution as a way to end the current crisis sparked by the 
hunger strike by Pilot Officer Chalat Worachat since 25 May. 
The option was suggested by senior citizen Doctor Prawet Wasi, 
and backed by Senate President Michai Ruchuphan, a 
national-level expert on legal affairs, who confirmed that a 
constitution drafting council could be set up through the 
amendment to Article 211 of the Constitution. 
  It is possible to set up a constitution drafting council and 
implement political reforms in Thailand if members of the 
parliament unanimously push for an amendment to Article 211 in 
order that a "constitution drafting council" be set up, 
comprised of not more than 100 members to be appointed by the 
king. Ten of them will represent the House of Representatives; 
five come from the Senate; and the rest will be picked up from 
the lists proposed to the House of Representatives and the 
Senate by the various groups and organizations. They will 
represent people from all walks of life. 
  The government should not look at the protest by Chalat 
Worachat as an individual matter. By nature, it is part of the 
nation's problem which is caused by a flaw in the political 
structure -- the people are unhappy with certain existing rules, 
which block the development towards social justice. So long as 
we allow this to continue, there will always be a risk of more 
crises. The government of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, which 
controls the majority in the House of Representatives, should 
therefore listen to the people and push for political reforms. 
This will be tantamount to overhauling Thailand's political 
structure, making it more up-to- date and responsive to 
democratic development. 
  We no longer consider the hunger strike by Chalat Worachat 
an 
individual matter since it has alarmingly created ideological 
rifts and divisions in the country. Some people already look at 
it as a national crisis. Political reforms, therefore, should 
be an option to save the country and also the life of Chalat 
Worachat. There are those who stick to the principle of 
legality to the point of overlooking the intention of legal 
principles; they stick too much to the letter. This group of 
people think that Chalat Worachat is alone in his struggle, and 
therefore they do not pay attention to whether Chalat will 
survive or die. 
  Although we never approved Chalat's tactic of pressure from 
the past, we, at this point, think that political reforms are 
urgently needed. There is nothing wrong with overhauling 
political rules and regulations. The administration can perform 
its work under the present constitution until the new 
constitution is completed. 
  This, however, will be made possible only when members of 
the 
parliament unanimously work for it. The Democrat Party, which 
controls the majority of the parliament and which serves as the 
core of the government coalition, especially should step out and 
take the role of leader in the campaign, instead of standing 
with its back to the wall, sticking to written principle, and 
looking at an impasse or a national crisis, which is not good at 
all. If the prime minister, who is leader of the Democrat 
Party, insists upon sticking to his principle, out of pride or 
any other reasons, we would like to call upon other members of 
the Democrat Party to freely use their good judgment and join 
other political parties in support of the campaign to achieve 
political reforms.

  [Text] A news conference was held at the DPRK Embassy in 
China on 4 June to expose and condemn the unfairness and 
irresponsibility of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA]. Reporters from the Chinese media and foreign reporters 
in China attended the news conference. DPRK Ambassador to China 
Chu Chang-chun made remarks at the news conference. 
  Ambassador Chu said: The IAEA has recently issued 
information indicating that it would not take the issue with the 
discovery of a considerable amount of undeclared plutonium in 
Japan. This shows the unfairness and irresponsibility of the 
IAEA as it is. 
  Pointing out that originally the foundation of the 
international organization's existence is based on its fairness, 
he concretely disclosed: Regarding nuclear the inspections of 
us, the IAEA has distorted the fact and submitted a wrong report 
to the UN Security Council. Based on it, the UN Security 
Council has adopted a so- called presidential statement, thus 
kicking up an improper commotion. Also, he stressed that this 
clearly shows the IAEA's unfairness. 
  He pointed out: The agency's behavior of backing Japan's 
nuclear armament by looking on it with indifference, while 
taking the issue with our peaceful nuclear activity under the 
unjust pretext, thus submitting its inspections to political 
intentions [kigu sachalul chongchijok uidoe pokchong 
sikimyonso], is an act of gravely running counter to the spirit 
of the IAEA itself. Also, he stressed that the agency must 
revise its unjust position on the nuclear issue of Korea in 
conformity with its own mission. 
  He appealed to reporters to correctly see the true color of 
the Japanese authorities' nuclear ambitions and to disclose and 
condemn them in the presence of the people throughout the world. 
At the same time, he also appealed to them to pay attention to 
the unfairness of the IAEA, which has conducted nuclear 
inspections from the insidious political angle. 
  While answering reporters' questions, he stressed that it is 
the United States that has built the largest nuclear depot in 
the Far East by introducing nuclear weapons into South Korea, 
and that has aroused the suspicion of nuclear development in the 
DPRK, therefore, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula can 
be only resolved by Korea-U.S. talks. 
  Referring to the so-called sanctions talked by the United 
States and its followers, he stressed that as already declared 
by the DPRK Government, we will regard any steps to impose 
sanctions on us as a declaration of war. Also, he expressed the 
conviction that as they have straightly embarked upon the single 
road of victory with their own foot up to date by smashing all 
kinds of obstructive plots by the U.S. imperialists, our people 
-- in the future, too -- will be fully capable of defeating any 
sanction steps with a strong might in which they are 
single-heartedly united around the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, and that they will continue consolidating and 
developing our country into a popular mass-centered socialist 
powerful country, thus upholding the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il- song.

<F P=106> ["General Director of DPRK General Department of the Atomic </F>
Energy Sends Letter to General Director of IAEA" -- KCNA 
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- Pak Yong-nam, general 
director of the General Department of the Atomic Energy of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, sent a letter to Hans 
Blix, general director of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency, on June 6 regarding the wrong "conclusion" of the IAEA 
Secretariat that the technical possibility of later measurement 
of fuel rods at the five megawatt experimental atomic power 
plant in the DPRK was lost. 
  The letter says: 
  I very much regret to know that you made a "hasty 
conclusion" 
that the agency could not provide assurance about the 
non-diversion of nuclear material, alleging as if the technical 
possibility for later measurement of core fuel rods would have 
been lost at the 5 mw experimental nuclear power plant. 
  We have agreed, a few days ago, to the agency's deputy 
director general's proposal on the consultation by exchange of 
telexes in respect of the refueling campaign and requested the 
agency to provide us with a scientific and technical answer to 
the manner proposed by us for preserving the technical 
possibility for later measurement of fuel rods. Nevertheless, 
you have not yet answered our proposal and transmitted to the UN 
Security Council an unreasonable report in which facts were 
misrepresented, speaking ill of us as if we had not yet replied 
to the agency's letter. 
  Moreover, what we cannot but make an issue of is the fact 
that you have ignored our unique status based on the suspension 
of the effectuation of our withdrawal from the NPT [Nuclear Non- 
Proliferation Treaty]. This our unique status has been created 
and recognized by the USA and IAEA. For these reasons, they 
agreed to the inspection for the continuity of safeguards 
knowledge, and so far the agency has conducted not the routine 
and ad hoc inspection under the safeguards agreement, but the 
inspection for the continuity of safeguards knowledge. 
  At present, the refueling campaign, too, is being conducted 
in the presence of the IAEA inspectors and under the IAEA 
surveillance and containment on the basis of the above-mentioned 
principles. 
  The IAEA inspectors, too, who are present during the 
refueling have recognized that there is no diversion of nuclear 
material from the reactor. Speaking of the verification of the 
core history alleged by the agency, the matter will be resolved 
automatically if our unique status will be removed. 
  At present, we are conducting the refueling campaign 
preserving the technical possibility for later measurement of 
fuel rods on the assumption that our unique status will be 
removed. The fuel discharge operation has been carried out 
channel by channel, channel group by channel group in sequence, 
and 40 rods from 4 channels have been discharged into one 
basket. All the operations of core discharge including the 
identification numbers of baskets and channels, sequence of rods 
in a channel, and the position of baskets in the spent fuel pond 
have been kept on the accounting and operating records by 
operators and confirmed by the IAEA inspectors every day. 
  This shows that the refueling operation is conducted in such 
a manner as preserving the possibility of reconstructing the 
channels of fuel rods and the sequence of rods in the channel, 
if necessary. The adequacy of the manner of preserving the 
technical possibility for later measurement has been proven not 
only theoretically but also experimentally. This is the only 
rational method suitable to our unique status. All the facts 
show that the agency can verify whether the nuclear material 
from the reactor has been diverted in the past, at the time when 
our unique status is removed. 
  Nevertheless, it was referred in your reports to the IAEA 
Board of Governors and the UN Security Council that "any future 
measurement of that fuel would have no practical value because 
they would have to be based on operators' records which are 
unverifiable and also because it would not be possible to 
reconstruct the configuration of fuel rods in the core." This 
shows that you seem to have no interest in a fair solution of 
"our nuclear issue," in keeping with your prejudiced political 
view in advance. Our practical experience from the past agency 
inspections shows that the more we accepted IAEA inspections 
with our maximum goodwill and generousness, the more artificial 
obstacles the agency made to the solution of our issue, leading 
us to serious situation, in attaching an unreasonable condition 
to us every time. 
  We made our position clear during the February board meeting 
in 1993 that the inconsistencies could be clarified if the 
agency verifies the fuel rods from the core during the refueling 
campaign. However, at that time, the IAEA Secretariat objected 
to our proposal, alleging that the inconsistencies could not be 
resolved in such a manner and made the board adopt the 
resolution of "special inspection of two ordinary military 
sites". 
  After the last March inspection, the IAEA Secretariat 
transmitted to the UN Security Council the matter of the 
"non-completed inspection activities" alleging that it is 
indispensable for the agency to carry out the smear taking from 
the glove boxes and gamma mapping in the building 3 at the 
radiochemical laboratory in order to verify non-diversion of 
nuclear material, upon the return to Vienna by the agency 
inspection team that had completed the activities for the 
continuity of safeguards knowledge. When we permitted the 
agency to conduct "non-completed inspection activities" as a 
special exception, the agency this time said to us that it is 
indispensable to measure the fuel rods from the core, which was 
a matter already denied by the agency in the past. 
  On one hand, the agency inspection team cancelled the 
agreement on the archive samples for clarification of the 
inconsistencies during the past inspection, and on the other 
hand, the agency says that it is indispensable for the agency to 
make "special inspection of two ordinary military sites" to 
verify non-diversion of nuclear material. This shows that the 
IAEA Secretariat continues to join the USA in their hostile 
policy towards the DPRK to make our ordinary military sites open 
one by one under the pretext of the inspection. 
  The current development of the refueling campaign bears 
resemblance to the IAEA's pressure campaign at the beginning of 
1993 when the agency cooked up the non-existent 
"inconsistencies" on the basis of the false intelligence 
information provided by a third party and imposed on us the 
so-called "special inspection of two ordinary military sites", 
on the basis of the "inconsistencies." I think such 
unreasonable acts of the IAEA are unprecedented events in the 
history of safeguards. 
  I would like to remind you that, for these reason, we could 
not but withdraw from the NPT last year. 
  In the light of the above, we cannot but doubt whether our 
nuclear issue can, indeed, be resolved through further 
consultations with the IAEA. 
  Recently, the IAEA Secretariat has laid obstacles to our 
normal nuclear activities concerning the refueling operation at 
the beginning of the campaign, intentionally avoiding the 
presence of the IAEA inspection team. On the other hand, at 
present, they have added another obstacle to a smooth solution 
of our nuclear issue by making a hasty conclusion that the 
agency could not provide assurance about the non-diversion of 
nuclear material. All these are very irresponsible and hasty 
behaviour where by the objective reality has been intentionally 
misrepresented. 
  Accordingly, the IAEA Secretariat will have to bear the full 
responsibility for all the consequences arising from such wrong 
conclusion and unreasonable behaviour. If the IAEA Secretariat 
takes our nuclear issue to the UN Security Council and continues 
to resort to only pressure on the basis of "hasty conclusion" 
that the technical possibility for later measurement of the fuel 
rods has been lost, widening its unfairness and partiality, we 
will not feel any longer the need that we are subject to the 
unreasonable binding of the IAEA Secretariat and cannot but go 
over to the next process of our peaceful nuclear activities.

<F P=106> ["Press statement" by Kang Sok-chu, DPRK first vice minister </F>
of foreign affairs and head of the DPRK delegation to the 
DPRK-U.S. talks issued in Pyongyang on 3 June -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] Kang Sok-chu, first vice minister of foreign affairs 
and head of the DPRK delegation to the DPRK-U.S. talks, 
published a press statement on 3 June on the recent U.S. 
orchestration of an anti-DPRK pressure campaign over the reactor 
core refueling of our experimental nuclear power plant. 
  He said: 
  It is one year since the DPRK-U.S. joint statement was 
published. 
  The joint statement was the first of its kind in the history 
of the DPRK-U.S. relations in which the sides promised each 
other to ban the use of Armed Forces, including nuclear weapons, 
and the threat with them, mutual respect of sovereignty and 
non-interference in each other's internal affairs. It was of 
weighty importance in that it laid the foundation for the 
DPRK-U.S. talks for a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula and a practical end to the hostile 
relations between the two countries. 
  Looking back on the past year, however, we must note with 
regret that the principles of the joint statement have not been 
observed. 
  As everyone knows, with the publication of the joint 
statement, we temporarily suspended the effectuation of our 
declared withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
[NPT] and, even with this unique status, we accepted on the 
highest level the inspection of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] for the continuity of safeguards. 
  And, fully considerate of the apprehensions of the United 
States, we promoted with sincerity the working-level contacts 
for the exchange of special envoys between the North and the 
South and even made a momentous decision to replace the graphite 
moderated reactor system with a light water reactor system at 
the sacrifice of the independence of our nuclear power industry. 
  The package solution to the nuclear issue which we were to 
propose at the third-round of talks included all the questions 
in which the United States might be interested, such as the 
resumption of the routine and ad hoc inspections of the agency 
pursuant to the safeguards agreement, our return to the NPT and 
the dismantling of the radiochemical laboratory with the 
replacement of the graphite moderated reactor with the light 
water reactor. 
  We do not intend to drive a bargain with the United States 
over the nuclear issue or get something from it in this 
connection. All we want is an end to the U.S. policy of nuclear 
threat to us and the removal of the hostile relations between us 
and the United States and the abnormal relations between us and 
the agency. 
  Only then can the nuclear issue be fundamentally resolved 
and 
thus peace be consolidated on the Korean peninsula and, 
furthermore, security be ensured in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  The United States, however, failed to give any practical 
assurances that it would renounce its policy of nuclear threat 
and stifling against us [urie taehan haek wihyop apsal 
chongchaegul] and, while using the phraseology of DPRK-U.S. 
talks, refused even to sit down at the negotiating table with 
us, leading the talks to an actual collapse. So we have not had 
even an opportunity to discuss the package solution with the 
United States. 
  The past year since the publication of the DPRK-U.S. joint 
statement has been, in the final analysis, a period in which the 
United States has not sought a solution to the problem through 
the talks but, on the contrary, used the signboard of the talks 
as a tool of pressure and a way of tricking us, according to the 
reversed mode of thinking that it would come to the talks when 
the problem is solved, and a period in which it forced South 
Korea to open its rice and arms markets over the nuclear issue 
and pursued only its selfish aim. 
  It is not difficult to see the motive of the start of the 
U.S.- orchestrated anti-DPRK pressure campaign over the core 
refueling at our experimental atomic power plant. 
  Core refueling is an indispensable normal process of the 
operation of an atomic power plant. Furthermore, as we have 
declared, we have taken measures to fully preserve the technical 
possibility of ad hoc inspection of the fuel rods when our 
unique status will have been removed as expected and we firmly 
ensure the non-diversion of the spent fuel rods. 
  Despite our well-intentioned step, however, some officials 
of 
the IAEA Secretariat concluded [kyollon hayonnunde] that the 
possibility of later measurement of fuel rods was lost. The 
Secretariat may give up measurement, if it does not want it. 
  For our part, we preserve the scientific and technical 
possibility of it. So, if the nuclear issue is solved between 
our country and the United States, not only the measurement of 
fuel rods but even more complicated problems than that would be 
solved without difficulty. 
  The honesty of our nuclear activities in the past could be 
seen clearly in the well-meant step of allowing an additional 
inspection [chuga sachal] of the radiochemical laboratory. 
  This notwithstanding, they tried to find fault with the core 
refueling, saying the possibility of measurement was lost. This 
is an insidious attempt to call in question our graphite 
moderated reactor system now in operation and put the brakes on 
the development of our existing nuclear energy industry as a 
whole, not to inquire into our nuclear activities in the past. 
In the final analysis, this cannot be construed otherwise than 
part of their political plot to stifle our system. 
  This is borne out by such ill-boding moves within the United 
States of late as open calls for UN sanctions [yuen chejae], 
multinational sanctions [tagukchok chejae] and preemptive strike 
[sonje tagyok] at peaceful nuclear facilities of the DPRK. 
  Should the United States thus totally give up even the 
DPRK-USA talks now, we would be left with no other choice but to 
conclude that our efforts for a diplomatic solution have failed. 
  If the United States is willing to have the talks now, our 
proposal for a package solution is still valid. But, if it 
chooses a strongarm measure, our option too will change. [kurona 
manil migugi kangkkwonui kirul taekhandamyon, uriga kalkildo 
tallajilkosida] We will go over to the next process of our 
nuclear activities and cannot but expand our independent atomic 
energy industry by the present method. [urinun uri haek 
hwalttongui taum kongjonguro nomogal kosimyo, chigumui 
pangsiktaero charipchok haek tongnyok kongobul touk hwaktae 
sikyo nagaji anulsuoptta] 
  In case the United States declares the foundation of the 
DPRK-USA talks has been destroyed, the foundation on which we 
have temporarily suspended the effectuation of our declared 
withdrawal from the non-proliferation treaty will collapse. 
  We have already notified the parties concerned that economic 
sanctions [kyongje chejae] would be regarded as a declaration of 
war against us. 
  In this case, not only the parties joining in the sanctions 
[chejae] against our Republic but also those backing such 
sanctions will be held responsible. 
  This is not what we want. 
  The United States must not take our patience for a sign of 
weakness.

<F P=106> ["Should the United States Choose Strong Arm, Our Option </F>
Will Change, Declares Head of DPRK Delegation to DPRK-U.S. 
Talks" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- Kang Sok-chu, first 
vice-minister of foreign affairs and head of the DPRK delegation 
to the DPRK-U.S. talks, published a statement on Friday on the 
lapse of one year since the publication of the DPRK-U.S. joint 
statement. 
  He said: 
  It is one year since the DPRK-U.S. joint statement was 
published. 
  The joint statement was the first of its kind in the history 
of the DPRK-U.S. relations in which the sides promised each 
other the ban on the use of armed forces including nuclear 
weapons and threat with them, mutual respect of sovereignty and 
non-interference in each other's internal affairs. It was of 
weighty importance in that it laid the foundation of the 
DPRK-U.S. talks for a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula and a practical end to the hostile 
relations between the two countries. 
  Looking back on the past one year, however, we must note

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "U.S. Imperialists' Maneuvers Which Run </F>
Counter to Nuclear Disarmament"] 
  [Text] The haughtiness of the United States whose habit is 
to encroach upon other countries' sovereignty has been revealed 
all the more. This is shown by the U.S. Defense Department's 
plan to push ahead with the development of up-to-date missile to 
detect and destroy our missiles they claim to be hidden 
underground. 
  The U.S. warmongers are now pouring $90 million into the 
development of this up-to-date missile. This is an open 
military action aimed at crushing [apsal] our republic by force. 
  The entire world knows that the U.S. hardline conservative 
force is stepping up the anti-DPRK pressure commotions under the 
pretext of our nuclear issue. They are openly raving about the 
detection and destruction of our missiles they claim to be 
hidden underground, attempting to wage a military attack on our 
republic. What an intolerable crime this is! 
  As facts prove, the United States raves about respecting the 
sovereignty of other countries and peace, but in actuality, it 
does not abandon the concept of confrontation and ambition for 
war but attempts state terrorism and armed interference against 
other countries, habitually engaging in dogmatism and 
arbitrariness. 
  The U.S. maneuvers to develop a new up-to-date missile under 
the so-called signboard of nuclear nonproliferation is a crime 
running counter to nuclear disarmament. It is a new military 
operation against the independent Third World countries, and an 
open act aimed at fattening monopolistic U.S. military suppliers. 
  As is known, U.S. military quarters put forth the so-called 
nonproliferation defense strategy early last December. This 
strategy encompasses such matters as the development of weapons 
to detect and destroy the underground military facilities used 
for the production of nuclear weapons and mobile missiles, the 
composition of a new military doctrine for war with some 
countries armed with nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, 
and the intensification of cooperation with NATO, and other 
allies, to realize them. 
  As the particulars of the nonproliferation defense strategy 
show, the United States is scheming to develop a newer murder 
weapon to maintain its monopolistic nuclear position and to 
oppose the developing countries under the pretext of 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. 
  After the collapse of the former Soviet Union, the United 
States has come to regard our country and those other countries 
engaged in building a new society under the anti-imperialism and 
independence banner as the enemy. 
  The present U.S. Administration claimed that it makes the 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons the basis of its state 
foreign policy, in which case the United States should place 
prior emphasis on reducing and completely abolishing its 
existing nuclear weapons in conformity with the trend prevailing 
after the end of the Cold War. At the same time it should 
prevent nuclear danger by the countries which are actually 
developing nuclear weapons or have ample potential to do so. 
  However, the U.S. imperialists are acting to the contrary, 
occupied by thoughts of nuclear hegemonism. They are not only 
continuously accelerating their modernization of nuclear weapons 
but overlooking the acts of nuclear weapons development by their 
allies and those other countries which are obedient to the 
United States. When it concerns countries to which they take 
offense, even peaceful nuclear activities come under suspicion 
and are unjustly checked. 
  A typical example of this is that the U.S. imperialists are 
loudly raving about nuclear weapons development and nuclear 
threats regarding our peaceful nuclear activity and are 
attempting to impose sanctions on us by mobilizing even 
international organizations. The U.S. Defense Department is 
developing a new missile capable of detecting and destroying the 
so-called missiles hidden underground and mobile missiles and 
dragging their allies to carry out their strategy, spreading the 
so-called nuclear threat under the signboard of regional 
security, which is all aimed at crushing our republic by force. 
  The U.S. imperialists are dragging Japan and other allies to 
carry out their aggressive strategy. The Japanese NIHON KEIZAI 
newspaper, in its recent issue, disclosed that Japan and the 
United States have agreed to provide a new framework to 
intensify military technology exchange--this is not accidental. 
Underlying herein is a sinister scheme that the United States 
develop modern weapons using Japanese technology and funds and 
that Japan attempts to become a military power with the backing 
of the United States. 
  Our people strongly oppose and denounce the U.S. maneuvers 
to 
monopolize nuclear weapons and build up arms and to crush our 
country and other independent anti-imperialist countries. In 
the recent UN disarmament meeting, the developing countries 
consistently exposed and condemned the double standard applied 
in the development of nuclear weapons and in the nuclear 
nonproliferation by Western countries, including the U.S. 
imperialists, and noted again the unjustness of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  The U.S. imperialists should listen to the just voice of the 
world's peace-loving people. Instead of raving in words about 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, the U.S. imperialists 
should put it into actual practice. 
  The U.S. imperialists' pushing ahead with their plan to 
develop an up-to-date missile could lead the extremely strained 
situation on the Korean peninsula to a further dangerous phase. 
The United States should hold itself responsible for the 
consequences arising from this. Our people and the officers and 
men of the People's Army are keeping a sharp eye on U.S. actions. 
  The United States should immediately stop the reckless plan 
to develop the anti-DPRK missile, and withdraw some 1,000 
nuclear weapons of various types and aggression forces from 
South Korea without delay. This is the real nonproliferation of 
nuclear weapons and an act in the interest of the United States 
itself.

<F P=106> ["Sword-brandishing of Nuclearmaniac" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam fascist 
clique a few days ago brutally suppressed inhabitants in Uljin 
County in a demonstration against the building of a nuclear 
waste dump, leaving some 20 people mortally wounded and 
arresting 24 on the scene. 
  NODONG SINMUN today says this brutality can be committed 
only 
by such fascist tyrants as the Kim Yong-sam group whose mode of 
existence is sword-brandishing. 
  To maintain one's existence and protect living environments 
pertains to the intrinsic independent rights of human beings, 
the analyst says, and continues: 
  The exercise of these rights can never be criminalized or 
suppressed in any case. Nevertheless, the puppets are brutally 
suppressing the people's righteous struggle for existence at the 
point of the bayonet. This is really a fascist outrage fully 
revealing the ferocity of the "civilian" dictatorship. 
  Their suppression of people opposing the building of a 
nuclear waste dump is a brigandish act for forcing them to 
reconcile themselves to nuclear harm. 
  Unpardonable is the crime of the Kim Yong-sam group which is 
going to build a nuclear waste dump and inflict irrevocable 
nuclear disasters upon the people, after converting South Korea 
into a nuclear base of the United States.

New York, held consecutive individual contacts with 
representatives of the permanent member states of the UN 
Security Council [SC] on 6 June to discuss cooperation on 
sanction measures on North Korea. 
  Minister Han explained the ROK Government's position that 
sanctions on North Korea are inevitable and exchanged views with 
representatives of the UN Security Council permanent member

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
articles and editorials published in 4 June ROK vernacular 
newspapers on moves toward the imposition of sanctions against 
North Korea for its failure to allow the International Atomic 
Energy Agency, IAEA, to conduct inspections. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 2 a 1,000-word 
article by Pak Tu-sik citing the government's position on 
applying sanctions against North Korea. Noting that the 
government agreed that it is inevitable to apply sanctions 
against North Korea, it continues to express worry about China's 
reaction. The article reports that the most desirable way to 
resolve the North Korean nuclear issue is for North Korea to 
eliminate all uncertainties regarding the nuclear issue on its 
own, but notes that it will be difficult to expect that North 
Korea will take such an action. The article concludes that the 
government hopes that sanctions against North Korea will be 
carried out gradually and hopes for an opportunity to resume 
talks with North Korea. 
  CHOSON ILBO on page 3 carries a 1,200-word article by 
Washington-based correspondent Chong Hae-yong citing the U.S. 
position regarding the North Korean nuclear issue. The article 
explains the background of the decision by the UN Security 
Council to consider sanctions against North Korea. The article 
notes that the United States is also concentrating on finding 
effective ways to take sanctions against North Korea. It notes 
the firm U.S. position that it will by no means allow North 
Korea to possess nuclear weapons. The article continues that the 
United States hopes that China will follow the decision made by 
the UN Security Council. The article concludes by noting that 
the United States opposes the eight-party international meeting 
proposal put forth by Russia to resolve the North Korean nuclear 
issue. 
  CHOSON ILBO on page 3 carries a 700-word article by An 
Hui-chang noting the National Unification Board's, NUB, analysis 
of why North Korea has let the situation move toward sanctions. 
It notes that this may be aimed at achieving a last-minute 
victory, realizing that there is still a lot of time before 
actual sanctions are applied against North Korea. The NUB 
believes North Korea is using the sanctions to secure its system. 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 2 an 800-word 
article by Chong Pyong-chin on the ROK Government's position. 
The article reports that the government has three possible 
plans in dealing with the sanctions. The article adds that 
these plans must be carried out while keeping the door open for 
dialogue. The article notes that apart from the UN sanctions, 
the ROK, the United States, and Japan are holding a meeting to 
deal with the North Korean nuclear issue. It concludes that in 
addition to international cooperation, the government is seeking 
various measures to deal with this matter in which the first 
stage is to examine the ways to suspend trade with North Korea. 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 5 a 900-word 
article by Ku Pon-yong on the government's measures to deal with 
the sanctions. The article reports the result of the 3 June 
coordination meeting of reunification and security officials 
dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue. It reports the 
government's position that sanctions against North Korea are 
inevitable. The article notes that if the economic sanctions 
are to be effective to make North Korea give up its nuclear 
development, China, Japan, and Russia must all participate in 
the sanctions. The article expresses concern over the fact that 
China must be persuaded to take part in the sanctions because it 
is a core variable in the success of the sanctions. The article 
concludes that if sanctions are taken against North Korea, it 
will suffer greater economic difficulties. Thus it is hoped 
North Korea will come forward to find a point of compromise 
regarding this matter. 
  SEOUL SINMUN on page 3 carries a 600-word article by Yang 
Sung-hyon urging China to join in the sanctions against North 
Korea, and on page 3 a 600-word article by Yi Kyong-hyong from 
Washington on the U.S. position on sanctions against North Korea. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 2 a 800-word 
article entitled "Will China Join in Sanctions Against North 
Korea?". The article reports that even though China is 
officially opposed to sanctions, the possibility of its changing 
its views for the UN Security Council vote cannot be excluded. 
  The newspaper also carries on page 3 a 1,000-word article by 
Washington-based correspondent Nam Chan-sun entitled "U.S. View 
on the North Korean Nuclear Issue." The article reports that a 
hard-line view prevails in the United States, a situation that 
will test the Clinton administration's diplomatic capability. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 a 
1,000-word 
editorial entitled "North Korean Nuclear Issue and ROK-Russia 
`Security Partnership.'" The editorial first welcomes the 
ROK-Russian agreement on the North Korean nuclear issue and 
stresses that "it is important for Russia to demonstrate its 
pledge and rhetoric through action." 
  The newspaper also carries on page 4 a 1,000-word article by 
reporter Chang Yun-yong entitled "Economic Sanctions Would Deal 
a Lethal Blow to North Korea." 
  The article reports that trade sanctions will cause North 
Korea the most enormous pain and that if China, a major food and 
energy supplier to North Korea, does not join in economic 
sanctions, the effect of the economic sanctions will be less 
than expected. 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN on page 3 carries an 
800-word editorial entitled "Unpredictable Future of the North 
Korean Nuclear Issue." The editorial says that even though 
economic sanctions will most likely be pursued, military 
threats, including a display of military power, will be stepped 
up, and tensions will be further aggravated on the Korean 
peninsula as a result. The editorial then asks the ROK 
Government not to uncritically follow international trends, but 
map out its own countermeasure for this difficult task. 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO on page 3 carries a 1,000-word 
editorial entitled "Have Domestic Countermeasures Been Mapped 
Out?" 
  The editorial asserts that a firm security posture must be 
assumed and stresses the importance of close cooperation between 
the ROK and the United States in coping with the crisis. It 
then asks the ROK Government to map out measures to cope with 
possible economic sanctions because some domestic businesses are 
involved in indirect North-South trade. It also asks the ROK 
Government to lead people by assuming a prudent and reliable 
attitude and making prudent remarks.

<F P=106> [By reporter Kang Tae-ho] </F>
  [Text] Economic sanctions against North Korea have been 
discussed in earnest. It will likely be difficult to impose 
UN-led sanctions because it will be difficult to win support for 
such sanctions from China and Russia. As a result, only the 
ROK, the United States, Japan, and other countries that are 
diplomatically close to those countries will participate in 
sanctions. 
  The United States considers North Korea as a hostile country 
and a country assisting terrorism and has banned exports of 
goods, except for goods for humanitarian purposes, and South 
Korea has linked the nuclear issue to North-South economic 
cooperation. Therefore, some people question why "sanctions" are 
referred to at this time under these circumstances. 
  North Korea is now facing economic difficulties; has a need 
to expand external economic cooperation to overcome the 
difficulties; and has adopted a foreign trade-first policy as 
one of the strategies to pursue during the three-year adjustment 
period for socialist construction. Therefore, other people 
point out that sanctions would deal a serious blow to North 
Korea in that sanctions would prevent North Korea from promoting 
external economic cooperation. 
  Generally speaking, a country's dependence on external 
sources is the most important factor in assessing how effective 
sanctions against that country will be. 
  It is difficult to correctly assess North Korea's dependence 
on external sources because not much objective information is 
available. Still, its dependence must be very low. North 
Korea's volume of trade for 1992 is estimated at $2.66 billion 
with the volume of exports at $1.02 billion and that of imports 
at $1.64 billion. The ROK National Unification Board estimated 
North Korea's GNP for 1992 at $21.1 billion. We can say North 
Korea's dependence on external sources is a little over 10 
percent. Given this factor, the effect of sanctions against 
North Korea will be very limited. 
  North Korea is found to be in a sense defenseless against 
sanctions in terms of its dependence on some specific countries 
and in terms of its need to import food, oil, and other 
strategic materials. North Korea does 33 percent of its trade 
with China, 17.6 percent with Japan, and 12.3 percent with CIS 
countries. This means North Korea does over 60 percent of its 
trade with these three, and it does almost 90 percent of its 
trade with its 10 biggest trading partners. Of course, the 
effect of sanctions will be minimal because China's 
participation in sanctions is negative and because only Japan 
and a few other countries will participate in sanctions. 
  Also, oil, bituminous coal, and other minerals North Korea 
imports account for a fourth of the total volume of imports, and 
corn, rice, and other sorts of grain account for 10 percent. 
The amount of imports for oil and grain, strategic materials, 
is estimated at approximately $500 million, out of the estimated 
$1.6 billion. North Korea has food and energy shortages. This 
means North Korea is able to import less oil and grain than it 
needs. Still, North Korea imports 57 percent of its oil from 
China, 34 percent from Iran, and 4 percent from Russia, and it 
imports 70 percent of its food from China. This is why China is 
a factor that determines the success or failure of sanctions.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Sanctions on North Korea and Economic Stability </F>
in the ROK"] 
  [Text] With international economic sanctions on North 
Korea drawing near, a sense of tension has been heightened in 
many domains. 
  Under a policy that economic sanctions led by the United 
States are an inevitable choice for blocking the North Korean 
nuclear development, the government is carrying out many-fold 
diplomatic efforts to seek more effective sanction methods, and 
has strengthened the alert posture of the entire Armed Forces, 
thus assuming the emergency work system. Under this situation, 
President Kim Yong-sam, now visiting Russia, held a news 
conference on the spot and stated that "both the ROK and the 
United States not only grasped the North Korean movement 100 
percent but also retained sufficient capabilities to cope with 
the an emergency. Therefore, the people may feel easy about a 
series of changes in the situation." 
  Since the situation at home and abroad surrounding the North 
Korean nuclear problem has been strained rapidly, people from 
all walks of life at home, who used to be insensitive to 
security, began to gradually realize the seriousness of the 
situation. With the increased number of stocks put on sale by 
foreign investors at domestic stock markets, indications show 
that the cold wind has begun to blow surrounding the North 
Korean nuclear issue. Reports also point out that business 
firms which have been pushing ahead with economic cooperation 
with North Korea in the past are taking pains to work out proper 
measures to cope with economic sanctions against North Korea 
when they actually take place. In particular, for some large 
business groups that have processing-on-commission [imgagong] 
plants in North Korea and have brought considerable quantities 
of North Korean materials to the ROK, sanctions on North Korea 
mean the overall discontinuation of North-South economic 
exchanges. Thus, it is urgent for them to work out appropriate 
measures to minimize the business deadlock anticipated after 
sanctions are imposed. 
  What we must keep in mind regarding sanctions against North 
Korea, to be pushed for as part of international efforts to 
block North Korea's nuclear development, is that our economy 
must not be left wavering. The method and time of sanctions on 
North Korea have not been concretely decided. However, even if 
details of sanctions are announced, the direct impact of such 
sanctions to our economy would be insignificant and may even be 
ignored. North-South economic exchanges pushed ahead by some 
business firms still remain in such an extent as to operate 
merely a certain number of processing-on-commission plants in 
North Korea and to bring in a certain quantity of North Korean 
materials. Moreover, these materials are merely plain consumer 
goods. The amount of their transactions was $4.38 million last 
year, and $4.63 as of the end of April this year. Compared to 
the scale of our imports amounting to $100 billion a year, this 
amount is, in a word, indeed negligible. 
  This being the case, what we should be on the watch for is 
psychological uneasiness about sanctions against North Korea and 
negative economic effects. In other words, our business firms 
and enterprises should not tuck themselves up in uneasiness 
without any grounds, and should not cause any economic unrest. 
In view of this, the government should inform economic 
organizations and business firms rapidly and correctly of 
changes in the situation at home and abroad lest they fall into 
a sense of uneasiness. In addition, the government should 
realize that the building of an economic cooperative system 
based on the understanding between business firms and the people 
is as important a task as ensuring the military security posture.

  [Text] New York, June 6 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu said Monday that China has shown a 
willingness to cooperate in international efforts to settle the 
North Korean nuclear problem and was unlikely to present an 
obstacle. 
  Han, visiting New York to clarify South Korea's position and 
cooperate with U.N. Security Council [UNSC] members on the 
nuclear problem, said there is no just cause for Chinese 
opposition to a U.N. resolution imposing sanctions on North 
Korea. 
  "Nobody can tell what China has in mind, but I think China 
does not have any just cause to oppose a U.N. resolution 
imposing sanctions on Pyongyang since North Korea is being 
uncooperative and there is no other way but to impose 
sanctions," Han said. 
  Han expected that a draft resolution would not be introduced 
at the Security Council in one or two days, saying, "a draft 
resolution has not been decided yet, and it should be decided 
through discussion among related nations." 
  The permanent UNSC members are in frequent contact on an 
unofficial basis because the North Korean nuclear problem is 
urgent, Han said. 
  "After having separate contacts with the ambassadors of the 
five permanent UNSC members and Japan, I have become aware that 
there is a consensus in the positions of South Korea, the United 
States and Japan and that the permanent UNSC members generally 
sympathize with the South Korean position," he said. 
  After holding talks with the ambassadors, Han met with 
Robert 
Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of State for political and 
military affairs, to reaffirm bilateral cooperation on the North 
Korean problem. 
  Han also met with Security Council President Salim Bin 
Mohammed Al Khussaiby and talked to U.N. Secretary-General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who is visiting Europe. Han is scheduled 
to hold a press conference on Tuesday before returning home.

  [Text] The visit of Choe Kwang, chief of general staff of 
North Korean People's Army, to the PRC may well be one of its 
regular exchange visits between the two countries, but the visit 
is attracting great interest due to the situation and the timing. 
  Noting that North Korea and the PRC have exchanged military 
delegations almost every year, some people think it is not a new 
factor of tension. During the past two to three years, the two 
countries have intensified military cooperation more than ever. 
A North Korean military delegation of functionaries of the 
Foreign Affairs Bureau visited the PRC on 28 February this year. 
When, delegation leader Major General Kim Hak-san, director of 
the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the North Korean Army, met on 2 
March with Zhang Wannian, chief of the general staff of the PRC 
Army, interests were focused on their "submarine deal" but 
nothing concrete was revealed. 
  However, the majority of the public find analyzes the visit 
to be unusual because the delegation is being led by General 
Chief of Staff Choe Kwang, and because of the significance of 
its timing. 
  It is suspected that Choe Kwang's trip is a move to prepare 
for "an emergency on the Korean peninsula" since he is the one 
who controls the general command of "military operations" under 
the Supreme Commander and Chairman of the National Defense 
Committee, Kim Chong-il. 
  Even more significant is the North Korean military 
delegation's visit to the PRC in a situation where the UN 
Security Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency are 
discussing sanctions on North Korea and in which North Korea 
announced that sanctions would be regarded as "a declaration of 
war" for which it is willing to risk war. This seems to 
illustrate the close military cooperation in North Korea's 
defensive position concerning the nuclear issue. 
  Military cooperation between North Korea and the PRC is 
significant enough to worry the ROK and the United States under 
circumstances where it is uncertain whether the PRC will join in 
the UN Security Council's decision to implement sanctions on 
North Korea. 
  While no concrete results are expected to be announced after 
the military exchange, as in previous military delegation 
exchanges between the two countries, it is not difficult to 
speculate that the two parties will assess the effect of 
sanctions on the situation of the Korean peninsula and discuss 
joint measures to cope with this. 
  So far, there are no signs that the PRC regards the 
situation 
on the Korean peninsula as a military emergency. However, it is 
highly probable that the PRC will convey the message that "the 
development of nuclear weapons is impossible under any 
circumstances" during the face-to-face meeting with North Korean 
military leaders because the PRC has strongly opposed North 
Korea's nuclear weapons development. 
  On the other hand, since the treaty of friendship, 
cooperation, and mutual assistance (military alliance) between 
North Korea and Russia was actually invalidated during President 
Kim Yong-sam's visit to Russia, North Korea is expected to 
repeat its intention to maintain and reinforce the treaty of 
friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance with the PRC.

  [Text] Seoul, June 7 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic 
Liberal Party (DLP) will ask the opposition camp to cooperate in 
building a national consensus on dealing with the North Korean 
nuclear issue, it was learned Tuesday. 
  At the same time, the ruling party will devise proper 
follow-up measures on its own to back up the results of 
President Kim Yong-sam's summit meetings in Russia. The party 
measures will be crafted through a series of meetings with 
concerned cabinet ministers who accompanied the president on his 
trip. 
  At a meeting of top postholders presided over by DLP 
Chairman 
Kim Chong-pil at party headquarters in Yoido, the ruling party 
decided to seek the opposition camp's cooperation in supporting 
sanctions against Pyongyang through individual contacts by key 
postholders. 
  President Kim will likely emphasize the need for a national 
consensus to settle the nuclear problem by maintaining a joint 
international stance when he explains the results of his Russian 
trip. Wednesday's meeting at Chongwadae will be attended by the 
heads of the three government branches -- administration, 
legislature and judiciary -- as well as the DLP and main 
opposition Democratic Party chairmen. 
  The ruling party will hold a meeting with main postholders 
from the opposition camp as soon as Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu and nuclear affairs ambassador Kim Sam-hun return home 
to give briefings on future measures and their consultations 
with the United States and Japan. 
  In a separate move, the ruling party will convene the 
National Assembly Foreign Affairs and National Unification 
Committee this week to press for joint parliamentary measures, 
including the adoption of a resolution urging North Korean 
acceptance of nuclear inspections. 
  At Tuesday's meeting, chief DLP policy-maker Yi Se-ki said, 
"despite the government's position that sanctions against North 
Korea are inevitable, there is some domestic opinion against the 
sanctions in fear of the possibility of war on the Korean 
peninsula. This (opinion) is feared to dissolve the prevailing 
public opinion and will be a stumbling block to the 
international mood against North Korea's nuclear adventures."

  [Text] Seoul, June 7 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
warned North Korea Tuesday that if it continues developing 
nuclear arms, it will only face further isolation and eventual 
destruction. 
  Kim issued the warning in his message to a meeting of the 
Seoul area members of the Advisory Council for Democratic and 
Peaceful Unification (ACDPU) held at the Sejong Cultural Center, 
which was read by Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok. 
  The whole world shares the view that North Korea must be 
prevented from developing nuclear arms, the chief executive 
emphasized. 
  "The government has endeavored to settle the North Korean 
nuclear dispute and improve inter-Korean relations with maximum 
patience and wisdom over the past year," he said. 
  Kim urged Pyongyang to give up its reckless nuclear arms 
development program in line with the trends of history and "come 
out to pave the way for co-prosperity of South and North Korea." 
  The road to unification will open when peace arrives on the 
Korean peninsula so that "South and North Korea can seek 
co-prosperity on the basis of cooperation and exchange," he 
stressed. 
  The president called on North Korea's leaders to ponder 
genuine co-prosperity and the path to improved welfare of the 
nation. 
  Korean reunification is not an illusion but a near-term 
reality in view of the trends of history, he noted. "Our 
persistent efforts at reform and change are preparations for 
unification." 
  The ACDPU Seoul meeting passed a resolution urging Pyongyang 
to accept international and inter-Korean nuclear inspections, to 
adapt to the global trends of development and reform, to 
guarantee the human rights of its people and to renounce the 
so-called unification front strategy.

  [Text] Tashkent, June 6 (YONHAP) -- South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam said on Monday that North Korea's nuclear 
development is a matter of life and death, which threatens world 
peace as well as the 70 million Korean people. He told 
journalists before he leaves Uzbekistan on Monday that if North 
Korea dares to push for imprudent adventure, then it will lead 
to nothing but self-destruction of North Korea. 
  Kim said, "We cannot allow even half a nuclear weapon in 
North Korea. I will deter North Korea without fail from having 
a nuclear weapon. We are watching the move of North Korea 24 
hours a day, and the military power of South Korea, U.S. forces 
in Korea and United Nations force can repress war on the Korean 
peninsula." 
  But he added that there are no strange military moves now in 
North Korea. "I will have the national security conference 
according to Constitution on Wednesday at Chongwadae. I will 
also have a dialogue with U.S. President Bill Clinton over the 
telephone to discuss ways to cope with the North Korean nuclear 
problem as soon as I return home," he said.

exercise. 
  In a news conference, (Han Cha-won), North Korea's permanent 
representative to the United Nations, said that the test firing 
of the missile was a regular and routine exercise and that North 
Korea's missiles are completely for defensive purposes. 
  The Japanese and U.S. Governments revealed at the end of

of China's Silk Worm missiles. 
  Until now, North Korea has not confirmed that it had test 
fired a missile.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Choe Won-ki: "How High Is the Pitch of </F>
Crisis on the Korean Peninsula--the Government Intensifies 
Alertness at the Front; Stock Market Plummeting; Weekend Traffic 
Unaffected, Thus Showing Double Response"] 
  [Text] With the possibility of the adoption of a UN 
resolution on sanctions against North Korea becoming a 
certainty, the pitch of crisis on the Korean peninsula is 
heightening. 
  The government undertook crisis-management steps on the 
Korean peninsula, such as intensifying the alert posture at the 
front, and this atmosphere is already reflected in inter-Korean 
relations and the stock market. 
  President Kim Yong-sam, who is currently visiting Russia, is 
the person who feels the pitch of crisis on the Korean peninsula 
most sensitively. 
<H5>  ROK-U.S. Hotline in Operation. </H5>
  Judging that UN Security Council sanctions on the North are 
a 
certainty in the wake of International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] Director General Hans Blix's 4 June report, President Kim 
has instructed the cabinet to operate a crisis-managing system. 
  The instructions President Kim gave from Moscow intensified 
the alert posture at the front; stabilizing public sentiment; 
strengthening international alliance; and setting up strategy 
for the UN Security Council. 
  Based on this, the government is operating the Unification 
and Security Coordinating Committee chaired by Deputy Prime 
Minister and Minister of the National Unification Board [NUB] Yi 
Hong-ku and the working ad hoc committee led by NUB Vice 
Minister Song Yong-tae. Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae has begun 
checking ROK-U.S. combat readiness with U.S. Defense Secretary 
Perry via a hotline. 
  The NUB says that North Korea has not shown any specific 
signs of change in its moves. 
  However, once the resolution on sanctions against the North 
is presented before the UN Security Council, North and South 
Korea are sure to engage in a fierce propaganda offensive 
against each other. 
<H5>  The South Will Counter the North in a Full-Fledged Manner. </H5>
  In this connection, the government issued a refuting 
statement to the North on 5 June in the name of Yi Sung-kon, 
chairman of the North-South Nuclear Control Committee. 
  In the statement, he criticized that "The statement dated 4 
June by North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu 
threatening to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
[NPT] was prompted by an extremely dangerous idea mocking at the 
expectations of the international community and the entire 
nation." 
  This deviates from the previous position of the government 
avoiding directly countering North Korean challenges as best as 
possible. 
  Concerning this change, a responsible government official 
said, "We have taken this position anticipating that the North 
and the South will exchange a fierce war of statements for a 
couple of months to come when the UN Security Council's economic 
sanctions against the North will become a reality." 
  The noteworthy moves North Korea has shown for the last 
24 hours were the two contrasting reactions, one dovish and the 
other hawkish, namely, the remark by Chu Chang-chun, North 
Korean ambassador to China, that "North Korea will permit all 
inspections if the third round of talks with the United States 
are realized," and the statement of the Committee for the 
Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland that "North Korea is 
prepared for both dialogue and war. 
  The government regards Ambassador Chu's remark as an trial 
balloon designed to test the political will of the ROK and the 
United States. 
  In the meantime, the sense of crisis resulting from the UN 
Security Council's discussion of sanctions is beginning to be 
felt conspicuously in the civilian sector. 
  On 5 June, when there was news about the Security Council 
pushing ahead with the resolution for sanctions against the 
North, the composite stock market index plummeted by 12.17 point 
to 930.26. 
  In view of the fact that the stock market index fell only 
about nine points when North Korea mentioned the "sea of fire" 
on 19 March, the stock market is considered to be watching the 
crisis resulting from the moves for sanctions against the North 
more seriously. 
  Meanwhile, a contrasting phenomenon is observed overseas. 
The ROK's Korea Fund (KF) and the convertible bond (CB), which 
temporarily fell in New York and London in March when North 
Korea mentioned the "sea of fire, are maintaining a stable 
market. 
  For instance, the Samsung Electronic Company's CB No. 2, the 
ROK's typical blue-chip convertible bond, remains at the $22 
level in the New York market despite the moves of the Security 
Council. 
  However, the Korean people enjoyed the golden Memorial Day 
weekend in the first week of June, going out to the Seoul-Pusan 
and Yongdong highways in 187,500 cars--60 percent more than 
ordinary weekends--thus revealing a double state of mind, 
feeling no immediate crisis. 
  The experts, commenting on this phenomenon, say, "It is true 
that the pitch of crisis is high on the Korean peninsula, but 
the majority of the people must be feeling that the North Korean 
nuclear issue will somehow find a clue to a solution through the 
heightening of crisis." 
  A reliable research worker from the National Unification 
Research Institute noted, "North Korea must be trying to 
maximize the utility of the nuclear card by replacing fuel rods 
on its own despite the fact that it could hold the third round 
of talks with the United States only if it acceded to additional 
inspections." He added, "There is a possibility of North 
Korea's staging a surprise show when the crisis on the Korean 
peninsula is at its peak in order to bring about a dramatic 
reversal in the crisis."

  [Text] Seoul, June 7 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam, 
upon returning from his seven-day trip to Russia and Uzbekistan 
Tuesday evening, said the visit has "opened a new historical 
horizon of South Korean-Russian cooperation." 
  Reading an arrival statement in a welcoming ceremony at 
Seoul 
airport, Kim stressed that "the Russian commitments to suspend 
arms sales to North Korea and make virtual amendments to the 
North Korea-Russia mutual assistance pact would help us build a 
new security footing." 
  The Russian and Uzbek Governments promised to protect ethnic 
Koreans in their countries so that they, as a minority people, 
do not suffer any racial discrimination, he said. 
  "With the visit to Russia in the wake of the visits to the 
United States, Japan and China, I have completed the framework 
of quadrangle diplomacy," he said. "To prepare ourselves for 
the ever-intensifying international and inter-regional 
competition, we must push ahead with our reform programs in a 
more vigorous manner."

<F P=106> [Speech by ROK President Kim Yong-sam upon arrival from his </F>
official visit to Russia and Uzbekistan at Seoul Airport on 7 
June--live] 
  [Text] My dear fellow countrymen: I have returned home, 
winding up my one-week visit to Russia and Uzbekistan. 
  Through the visit, I have opened a new historic horizon for 
ROK-Russian cooperation. Ending the era of conflict and war 
between them, the two countries have built a firm foundation for 
mutually complementary partnership relations. 
  Russian President Yeltsin promised to suspend [chungdan] 
selling arms to North Korea and said that Russia will in fact 
scrap the mutual assistance treaty [sangho wonjo choyaktto 
sasilsang pegihagettago hangosun]. This will contribute to 
establishing a new basis for our security. 
  Russia promised resolute measures, such as joining 
international sanctions, when necessary, to stop the North 
Korean nuclear program. Russia delivered to us data concerning 
the Korean war. This means that the past Cold War between the 
ROK and Russia has been completely liquidated. 
  That I have visited the Russian Pacific fleet as ROK 
president symbolizes that the two countries are closely 
cooperating in security as well. 
  These are epoch-making events that were hardly imaginable a 
few years ago. 
  Our two countries have agreed to open a new era of common 
prosperity. Based on the agreements of cooperation of various 
types signed during my visit, the two countries can now carry on 
practical economic cooperation and technological cooperation. 
  With my visit to Russia, I have completed visits to four 
countries, namely, the United States, Japan, China, and Russia. 
I have completed the framework of the rectangular diplomacy to 
bring forth peace in Northeast Asia, to establish a new world 
order, and to promote our national interest. 
  My dear fellow countrymen: That we have promoted friendship 
and cooperation with Uzbekistan during my visit also has a very 
important significance. Uzbekistan has been carrying out the 
most steady reform among the CIS countries. Uzbekistan not only 
has abundant natural resources, such as gold and cotton, but has 
a great potential for development. 
  Uzbek President Karimov proposed active economic cooperation 
with our country. President Karimov assured me that a legal and 
systematic foundation will be laid so as to promote our 
businesses' advance into the Uzbek market. Large-scale joint 
investment has already been undertaken between the businesses of 
the two countries. I expect that Uzbekistan will in time play a 
role as our forward base for the Central Asian region. 
  My dear fellow countrymen: I met our beloved brethren in 
Russia and Uzbekistan. They were pioneering life with vigorous 
power and vitality. Despite the history of hardship they 
suffered, they preserved well the Korean tradition and culture. 
With diligence and sincerity characteristic of our nation, they 
were enjoying a high reputation. They were proud of their 
fatherland's development. I was deeply moved by their positive 
life. 
  I was assured of ample consideration by the governments of 
the two countries so that our compatriots may not suffer 
disadvantages as a minority. 
  I visited Vladivostok on my way home. Vladivostok is closely 
connected with us historically as a base for our independence 
movement. It is a region whose importance is highlighted for 
our economic advance into Siberia. I visited the Russian 
Pacific Fleet there, and had a historic opportunity to look over 
the Korean peninsula from there. 
  It took no less than half a century to go to Vladivostok, 
which is close to the Tumen River. I have returned home with a 
hope that I will be able to go there by a shorter way without a 
detour next time. 
  My dear fellow countrymen: Through the rectangular diplomacy 
which began toward the end of last year, I vividly felt that our 
country is importantly appraised in the international community. 
We can play a leading role in the Asia-Pacific era. We can 
stand aloft in the center of the new sphere of civilization. 
  Through the visits I have made, I renewed my resolve as well 
as my confidence. In the world ahead, competition will be even 
more keen among countries and regions. If we fail to keep up in 
competition, we will be a straggler and loser. The advanced 
countries were active in meeting this challenge. The countries 
that are catching up are also transforming themselves at a 
tremendous speed. The only way we can follow is to carry on a 
practical reform more vigorously. I will do my best as 
president to strengthen our security and promote the 
competitiveness of our country. 
  Let us all advance forward vigorously united in one, 
overcoming the syndrome peculiar to a transitional period. 
  Thank you.

  [Text] Seoul, June 7 (YONHAP) -- The National Police Agency 
(NPA) placed all policemen nationwide on indefinite alert Monday 
and adopted an emergency footing in connection with the 
uneasiness over the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  In a cable message addressed to all police throughout the 
country, the NPA instructed them to go on an emergency footing 
as "North Korea's provocation threat has become higher than at 
any other time before with the imminent U.N. sanctions against 
North Korea and heightening tensions between South and North 
Korea." 
  The police immediately began tightening all national 
checkpoints as well as air and sea ports to guard against 
infiltration by "impure elements" such as spies. At the same 
time, they have established tripartite cooperative operations 
involving civilians, the military and police while heightening 
vigilance at major government facilities and buildings and 
foreign diplomatic missions, including the U.S. Embassy. 
  At the same time, the police placed their five-minute 
stand-by and mobile troops on alert for action at any time and 
reinforced protection for important national figures.

  [Text] The government yesterday said it would sternly deal 
with any domestic moves to support or praise North Korea's 
policy or ideology. 
  Security-related cabinet officials, in a meeting Monday, 
agreed on the necessity of establishing a tight security posture 
in the nation with tensions mounting on the Korean Peninsula in 
the aftermath of North Korea's confrontations with the 
international community over its nuclear issue. 
  "The officials reaffirmed their will to prevent at any cost 
a 
situation that may cause public anxiety about security or 
threaten stability in the everyday lives of the people," said 
the Prime Minister's Office after the meeting. It said they 
agreed that both domestic and international measures are 
necessary for this purpose. 
  Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok, while presiding over the 
meeting, 
made it clear that any activities praising Pyongyang such as 
those actions by a student group, Hanchongnyon [Korea Federation 
of General Student Councils], in a recent rally in Kwangju, 
would not be tolerated, the office said. 
  The government defined the recently formed Hanchongnyon as a 
pro-Pyongyang organization and ordered a crackdown on it. 
  Prime Minister Yi and other participants reviewed in the 
meeting recent development in the North Korean nuclear issue and 
recent military movements in the Communist country, it said. 
  The participants also reviewed the government preparations, 
including those by the military, for any possible mishaps, the 
office said. 
  "The officials also agreed that maintaining national 
consensus is most important in maintaining security here," it 
said. 
  To enhance its capability for gathering information on North 
Korea, the participants decided to keep open 24 hours a day 
channels of dialogue with the United States and strengthen 
cooperation with the U.S. forces here against any contingencies, 
the office said. 
  Those who attended the meeting included both deputy prime 
ministers, Yi Hong-ku for unification affairs and Chong Chae-sok 
for economic affairs; Kim Tok, director of the Agency for 
National Security Planning (NSP); Home Affairs Minister Choe 
Hyong-u; Justice Minister Kim Tu-hui; Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae; Information Minister O In-whan; and Vice Foreign 
Minister Pak Kon-u. 
  Meanwhile, many officials in the related government 
ministries, including the Prime Minister's Office, the Foreign 
Ministry and the National Unification Board, were on regular 
duty Sunday and yesterday, the nation's Memorial Day. 
  Premier Yi inspected offices of major government ministries 
and agencies Sunday to check their duty posture.

  [Text] Seoul, June 7 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam, 
after returning from visits to Russia and Uzbekistan, has called 
a National Security Council meeting for Wednesday [8 June], 
indicating his firm resolve to defend the country against 
possible provocation by a cornered North Korea. 
  The fact that a Security Council meeting has been called for 
the first time since the inauguration of the Kim administration 
in February 1993 underscores the gravity of the worsening North 
Korean nuclear row. 
  As stipulated by Provision 91 of the Constitution, the 
National Security Council is an official presidential organ from 
which the chief executive can seek advice on foreign, military 
and domestic affairs prior to deliberating policy at a cabinet 
meeting. 
  A National Security Council meeting is one notch higher than 
a meeting of national security-related ministers or a 
unification-security policy coordination meeting, convened 
frequently in the past to discuss the dispute over Pyongyang's 
nuclear program. 
  Consequently, it is designed to be called at a time of 
crisis 
and policy decisions forged at this kind of meeting carry much 
more weight, according to analysts. 
  While visiting Uzbekistan, President Kim said Monday, "North 
Korea's development of nuclear weapons is a problem on which not 
only the survival of the 70 million Korean people depends. It 
also threatens the peace and security of Northeast Asia as well 
as the world." 
  "We are keeping a close watch on North Korea 24 hours a day 
and our troops, the U.S. and U.N. forces have enough strength to 
deter a war on the Korean peninsula," Kim said. 
  This National Security Council meeting is a sizeable affair. 
It is being attended by the prime minister, deputy prime 
ministers, and the defense, foreign, home affairs and finance 
ministers in addition to the director of the Agency for National 
Security Planning. 
  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who is an 
associate member of the council, also has the right to speak at 
the meeting. 
  Chief and senior presidential secretaries can attend the 
meeting if the president so desires. It is understood that Kim 
has invited chief secretary Pak Kwan-yong, Yi Won-chong, senior 
presidential secretary for political affairs, Chong Chong-uk, 
senior secretary for foreign and National Security Affairs, Pak 
Chae-yun, senior secretary for economic affairs, and 
presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik. 
  By presiding over the first meeting of the National Security 
Council, President Kim obviously wants to demonstrate both at 
home and abroad his determination to handle any developments 
arising from the North Korean nuclear dispute. 
  Officials at Chongwadae [presidential offices], however, 
took 
pains to stress that the meeting is being held in "a crisis 
situation." 
  The president and his top officials want to "check the 
possibility" of the North Korean question reaching the crisis 
point, they said. 
  President Kim appears to have considered three main 
objectives in calling the meeting. 
  First, Kim probably aims to demonstrate to the world that 
South Korea, as a nation that is most directly involved, is 
doing its utmost as the U.N. Security Council prepares to 
discuss sanctions against North Korea. 
  Second, the president wants to convey a strong message to 
North Korea not to misread the South's resolve and undertake any 
rash action. 
  And third, Kim intends to assure South Koreans that the 
nation's preparedness is complete and its surveillance 
water-tight, enabling them to depend on their government.

  [Text] Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating has pledged 
support for UN sanctions against North Korea. Linda Mottram 
reports: 
  Shortly after arriving in London at the beginning of his 
10-day visit to England and France, Mr. Keating released a 
statement on the North Korea tension. He has reiterated 
Australia's support for any action by the UN Security Council on 
the issue. He says it may still not be too late for 
negotiations, but Mr. Keating says increasingly it looks as if 
the UN Security Council will have to consider further action to 
indicate the depth of international concern.

  [Text] The Philippine Government yesterday welcomed the 
results of the Cambodian peace talks which ended last 28 May in 
North Korea, the Department of Foreign Affairs [DFA] announced 
yesterday. 
  "The Philippines believes that the security of the region is 
based on the principles affirming the right of every state to an 
existence free of external interference and to determine its own 
future," DFA spokesperson Susan Castrense said. 
  During the peace talks, the Cambodian Government and the 
Khmer Rouge agreed to form a standing committee to begin meeting 
this 15 June so that issues dividing the two sides in Cambodia's 
civil war could be dealt with. 
  Foreign affairs officials pointed out the Philippines has 
played an active role in seeking a "comprehensive, fair, and 
reasonable political settlement" of the issue on Cambodia 
through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. 
  It will be recalled that Manila dispatched 702 security 
personnel to Cambodia as part of its contribution to the United 
Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia after the 
UN-sponsored Paris Agreement was signed in December 1991. 
  On the level of ASEAN, the Philippines participated in the 
Asia-Japan Tripartite Cooperation in Cambodia in response to an 
invitation made by the Japanese Government. Manila also 
contributed $100,000 to the UN Trust Fund for the Cambodian 
peace process in response to an appeal made by UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  The Philippines recognized Kampuchea in April 1976 as the 
legitimate representative of the Kampuchean people.

<F P=106> [Article by Uk Kimseng and T. Mohan: "World Support Needed"] </F>
  [Text] Phnom Penh -- The failure of the much awaited 
Pyongyang peace talks has reiterated one vital point, that the 
Khmer Rouge will remain as recalcitrants. 
  It is now time for the world community, particularly the 
signatories of the Paris Peace Accords to rally support for the 
often embattled Royal Government of this nation. 
  The Royal Government, under the leadership of First Prime 
Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun 
Sen, has proven to the world community that they truly desire 
peace with the Khmer Rouge, national unity and reconciliation. 
  However, the Khmer Rouge guerrillas have chosen to spurn 
peace talks with ceasefire conditions of their own, despite 
agreeing to unconditional peace talks called for by His Majesty 
Norodom Sihanouk. 
  The international community should not delude themselves in 
thinking that their responsibility to this nation is over, with 
the end of the United Nations mission and the elections. 
  They have a bigger role to play in ensuring that the hand 
that fought for democracy which brought bitter enemies together 
and a nation reborn from the brink of disaster, remains alive. 
  They must ensure that supporters of the Khmer Rouge, who 
include those who warn or demand other nations not to provide 
military help to a supposedly corrupt nation, are made to tow 
the line. 
  Popular or unpopular support for the Khmer Rouge must stop 
at 
all cost. There is a Royal Government elected by the people and 
the Khmer Rouge had chosen to stay away from this process. 
  Which nation in the world is not corrupt? Neighbouring 
countries of this Kingdom have been corrupt as well and the 
Government is fond of telling the world at large that they often 
cannot control their army. 
  The Khmer Rouge cannot survive or mount fresh counter 
attacks 
against the Royal Government army without outside support, 
including economical support. 
  Is economics a better price to pay than the human life and 
misery that they have been undergoing? If the answer is 'no', 
then the world community should regroup, and mount one cohesive 
and massive campaign to wipe out the Khmer Rouge or force them 
to mend their ways. If military action is the only way, as 
proven by the Royal Government, then support them. 
  The Royal Cambodian Government Armed Forces [RCAF] have 
proven in the past that they are capable of holding their own 
against the Khmer Rouge, despite being poorly armed, equipped, 
underpaid and poorly disciplined. 
  If the world community could resolve this and do it fast, 
then the RCAF have the chance of bringing about national unity, 
peace and reconciliation, an attempt which talks have failed to 
produce. 
  We cannot afford another Bosnia in South-East Asia or a 
Somalia. 
  The Royal government needs aid and vital assistance fast and 
the world community, particularly the signatories of the Paris 
Peace Accords, owe it to this nation to ensure that peace is 
maintained and that the nation progresses. 
  The Khmer Rouge will continue to make allegations, launch 
terrorist campaigns and cause panic and fear. 
  They should not be allowed to fulfill their unwavering 
desire 
to return to power and in the process, persecute thousands or 
millions more. 
  A military solution is now the answer as talks have failed.

  [Text] Khmer Rouge Radio on 31 May ran a story about the 
so-called statement by 154 students and teachers in various 
localities in Cambodia on the establishment of the National 
Temporary Committee against the second (?war) aggression by the 
United States in the country. Copies of the statement were then 
distributed to the press. The Khmer Rouge statement said the 
United States has declared a second aggression against Cambodia, 
and called on the entire Cambodian population to fight this 
aggression. The statement [word indistinct] said at present 
tens of thousands of Vietnamese people are coming for business 
activities and natural resource exploitation, endangering 
Cambodia. 
  The distortion of facts has become a nature of the Khmer 
Rouge. Most recently they accused Vietnam, the United States, 
France, and Australia of backing the Cambodian Government troops 
in attacks on Khmer Rouge bases. 
  Concerning the latest fabrication, a spokesman of the 
Cambodian Information Ministry, Mr. Sieng Lapresse on 1 June 
said the allegation used by the Khmer Rouge was an insult to 
Cambodian teachers and students. He also pointed out that the 
Khmer Rouge who had burned schools, books, and killed 
intellectuals cannot represent teachers and students to trick 
people; and that the Khmer Rouge should be outlawed and chased 
out of the Royal Palace. Mr. Sieng Lapresse also termed the 
Khmer Rouge as butchers who have destroyed the country's 
culture, and sold off the country interest to foreigners. At 
the beginning of the peace process in the country, the Khmer 
Rouge sought all means it could to destroy peaceful 
reconstruction. Quite recently,the round table peace talks also 
failed due to the Khmer Rouge absurd demands. It is of no 
surprise that the Khmer Rouge resorts to other tricks.

  [Text] The Thai deputy prime minister confirms that 
Thailand is prepared to cooperate with the United States in 
narcotics suppression. 
  After a meeting with the visiting director of the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Agency [DEA], Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan 
said that there should be greater international cooperation in 
narcotics prevention and suppression than there currently is and 
cooperation should be carried out by all sides concerned. 
  [Begin Amnuai recording] There is little cooperation at both 
the national and international levels. I think that there is a 
need for greater collaboration in policy planning, manpower, and 
financial cooperation. Regarding Southeast Asia, the U.S. 
official said that this region is the production base that 
supplies about 60 percent of the heroin in the U.S. market. He 
expressed concern that this problem is intensifying. Thailand, 
however, is prepared to render cooperation. 
  In addition, he said that his country also would further 
cooperation with every other neighboring country, especially the 
countries which are major sources of narcotics production. This 
is because some countries are not able to solve the problems 
themselves. The policies to solve the narcotics problem and to 
develop the economy should be implemented concurrently. Citing 
the case of Thailand as an example, hill tribe people, 
villagers, or farmers are encouraged to convert their crops from 
narcotics plants to other crops provided they are able to earn 
sufficient incomes. [End recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-san: "Force-Oriented Policy Never </F>
Works With Us"] 
  [Text] International reactionaries led by the United States 
are more wildly engaging in pressure tactics over the issue of 
refueling our experimental nuclear power reactor. 
  As it has been reported, the UN Security Council adopted a 
president's statement on 30 May. The president's statement, 
which is written according to a premeditated plot by some member 
states of the UN Security Council, consists of absurdities, 
finding fault with us by stating that the fuel rods should be 
replaced only in compliance with the practical demands of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], and that the 
opportunity of selected separation and preservation of fuel rods 
might be lost. 
  This is written based on the IAEA's unjustifiable and unfair 
evaluation and we cannot accept this. 
  In concurrence with the announcement of the president's 
statement, there have been voices emerging from the United 
Nations and the United States in succession raving about UN 
sanctions and multinational sanctions. 
  On the other hand, backed by such a situation, U.S. Defense 
Department spokesman Dennis Boxx declared on 2 June that the 
ultralarge carrier Independence, which is participating in the 
Rimpac military exercise, could change its route and be 
mobilized somewhere else if necessary. 
  In the meantime, an announcement was made in concurrence 
with 
the president's statement that the Ulchi Focus Lens joint 
military exercise to be conducted by the U.S. forces and South 
Korean puppet Army will begin in August. 
  It is clear that such political and military moves stem from 
the maneuver to make us yield to the unfair demands of the 
United States and the IAEA. However, this will not work. As 
shown in earlier DPRK-U.S. relations and the process of the 
negotiations and dialogue between us and the IAEA, pressure and 
force just do not work with us and cannot solve the problem. 
  In any case, it is truly a regretful deed staining the UN 
history that the UN Security Council, which has a weighty 
responsibility for the world's peace and security, is finding 
fault with us following the IAEA's groundless scheme and 
conspiracy. It proves that the UN Security Council is seriously 
violating the principle of fairness, which is the basis for its 
existence. 
  Therefore, we regard the president's statement against us as 
utterly unjust and we thoroughly reject it. 
  For things to proceed on the right track, the UN Security 
Council should have first taken up the issue of the IAEA 
Secretariat's unfair conduct. Before the refueling began, our 
Republic had asked the IAEA many times to take the necessary 
steps, including the observation and replacement of the seals, 
but it never sent an inspection team until the refueling began. 
It is none other than some quarters of the IAEA Secretariat 
that intentionally disregarded the UN Security Council 
president's statement dated 31 March by refusing the additional 
inspection [chuga sachal] even though we had allowed it. 
  Next, picking a quarrel by writing in the presidential 
statement that the opportunity to select, separate, and store 
the fuel rods may be lost is also a stubborn insistence that is 
not feasible. 
  At the recent negotiations between the agency's negotiating 
team and our side in Pyongyang, discussions were basically 
carried out on the technical possibility of preserving for later 
measurement the replaced fuel rods, and in particular, 
sufficient discussions were held on the feasibility of such a 
method, which we are currently applying. If there is a package 
settlement between the DPRK and the United States regarding the 
nuclear issue in the future, this method makes it possible to 
sufficiently verify our past nuclear activities. Therefore, the 
agency said that it would seriously examine this method and 
decided to continue the discussion later. 
  Nevertheless, even before arriving at the Vienna 
headquarters, the agency's negotiating team distorted the 
situation as if the negotiations were broken without giving a 
clear explanation and presented our issue to the UN Security 
Council. It goes without saying that such an action by the 
agency stems from the dirty intention of driving us into the 
nuclear dock in accordance with the scenario it drew up in 
advance. 
  Our work of replacing the fuel rods at this time is being 
carried out under the presence of the agency's inspection team 
and strict control of the surveillance equipment. Regardless of 
these facts, picking a quarrel by saying that the opportunity to 
select, separate, and store the fuel rods may be lost shows that 
the UN Security Council is intentionally joining forces with the 
IAEA's unreasonable claim. 
  As we are currently under a special status in which we have 
temporarily suspended the effectuation of the withdrawal from 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, we have no legal duty 
whatsoever to receive regular and irregular inspections [chonggi 
mit pichonggi sachal] in accordance with the nuclear safeguards 
accord. We can by no means respond to the agency's demands that 
we accept such inspections. This can be realized only at a 
period when our special status is dissolved. 
  Nevertheless, the true intention of carrying out tactics of 
political oppression against us regarding the issue of replacing 
the fuel rods, is to make an excuse to crush [apsalhal] us 
militarily. 
  If the UN Security Council attempts to unreasonably carry 
out 
sanctions against us regarding our nuclear issue, we will justly 
exercise our sovereign rights, and it will be inevitable to take 
decisive corresponding measures. This is our people's firm will. 
  The United States and its insidious following forces must 
not 
misjudge the situation. We treasure peace but we will not beg 
for it if the nation's dignity is infringed upon. We are 
prepared for both war and dialogue. 
  The international reactionary forces under the initiative of 
the United States must by no means see our tolerance and 
patience as weakness.

<F P=106> [Report by Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>
  [Text] Last night, North Korea sent an urgent message to 
the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], warning that it 
would have no choice but to turn its peaceful nuclear activities 
to the next stage if the IAEA refers its nuclear issue to the UN 
Security Council or continues to apply pressure. 
  (Pak Yong-nam), director of North Korea's Atomic Energy 
General Department, sent a message to IAEA Director General Hans 
Blix last night in which he said it was an unjust act to North 
Korea for the IAEA to reach the hasty conclusion that it would 
be impossible to analyze samples from nuclear fuel rods because 
it was still possible. 
  It is analyzed that North Korea sent such a message as a 
part 
of its diplomatic strategy aimed at lessening the pressure on 
it. In the event that the IAEA Board of Governors takes a 
hard-line measure against North Korea, it seems possible that 
North Korea will take some tough measures, including its 
withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  The IAEA Board of Governors will map out countermeasures 
tomorrow afternoon after discussing the issue of North Korea's 
violation of the nuclear agreement as an isolated agenda item.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
vowed Monday night that Japan will make every effort within the 
limits of its Constitution to cooperate in the event the U.N. 
Security Council [UNSC] imposes sanctions on North Korea over 
its alleged nuclear arms development program, a senior Foreign 
Ministry official said. 
  Hata made the remarks at an emergency meeting convened 
following weekend consultations of Japan, the United States and 
South Korea in Washington to discuss the North Korean nuclear 
issue, the official said. 
  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, Chief Cabinet Minister 
Hiroshi Kumagai, Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito and Shunji 
Yanai, director general of the Foreign Ministry's Foreign Policy 
Bureau who attended the Washington get-together -- were present 
at the meeting Monday. Hata told the meeting that if the 
Security Council decides to take measures, including sanctions, 
to put pressure on North Korea to change its position, Japan 
will support the move and cooperate as much as possible within 
the framework of the Constitution, the official said. Hata also 
instructed the government to study measures the country would 
take in case the Security Council adopts the resolution. 
  Hata strongly urged North Korea to fully cooperate with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to eliminate 
international suspicions that it is developing nuclear weapons. 
He said Japan will make every diplomatic effort to solve the 
problem peacefully, through international coordination, the 
official said. The diplomatic efforts include close 
consultations with South Korea, China and other relative 
countries, the official said. 
  In a related development earlier in the day, government 
officials indicated Kakizawa may visit Seoul as early as this 
weekend to hold talks with his South Korean counterpart Han 
Song-chu. The date of the foreign ministerial meeting, however, 
has not yet been decided due to the Diet schedule. Kakizawa may 
also visit China, according to government sources. 
  Yanai, U.S. Assistant secretary of State Robert Gallucci and 
Kim Sam-hun, South Korea's special envoy on the nuclear issue, 
agreed over the weekend to adopt a united front on the North 
Korean nuclear issue. In a joint statement issued after the 
talks, the three nations called on the United Nations to take 
prompt action against Pyongyang, including the consideration of 
sanctions.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Japan may have to take steps 
outside the United Nations to deal with the threat of North 
Korea's alleged push for nuclear arms if the world body fails to 
agree on a unified action plan, a coalition official said 
Tuesday [7 June]. 
  "We will first try as far as possible to discuss the issue 
of 
possible sanctions (against North Korea) within the U.N. 
framework," said Hajime Funada, a ranking official in Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata's Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a key 
component in the ruling coalition. 
  "But... there is a possibility of our taking measures 
outside 
the U.N. framework in the event of an emergency," he told a 
press luncheon. "I don't think we can give up that option." 
  But Funada, a protege of Ichiro Ozawa, the coalition's 
backroom political deal maker, said Tokyo will do all it can to 
encourage Pyongyang to allay suspicions over its nuclear program 
within the bounds of its Constitution, which bans the use of 
force in resolving international disputes. 
  On domestic politics, Funada showed interest in Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) Secretary General Wataru Kubo's proposal 
for voluntary resignation of the Hata cabinet after passage of 
the long-overdue fiscal 1994 budget through the Diet. 
  Kubo, the No. 2 man in the second largest opposition party, 
made the proposal as a prerequisite for opening talks on the 
SDP's return to the coalition. 
  "This is a rescue boat for us," Funada said. "Whether or not 
a voluntary resignation is possible in real politics, we must 
seriously weigh the possibility of taking some action close to 
it," he noted, referring to a potential, full-scale cabinet 
shakeup to bring the SDP back to the fold. 
  The SDP walked out of the governing alliance in late April 
in 
protest against the sudden formation by other coalition partners 
of a new parliamentary group excluding the SDP, a move that 
forced Hata to form the first minority government since 1955.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa said Tuesday [7 Jun] he will make diplomatic efforts in

peacefully. 
  Kakizawa, who plans to leave for South Korea and China on 
Saturday to consult with his counterparts on the issue, said at

peacefully and I will speak so that North Korea accepts 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and 
returns completely to the agency." 
  The foreign minister said he will ask China to try to 
persuade North Korea to accept inspections and he will also urge 
Beijing to cooperate with the joint action of the international

  [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- The government is planning 
to send Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa to South Korea soon for 
bilateral ministerial talks, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi 
Kumagai said Monday [6 June]. 
  "We are currently considering the convening of Japan-South 
Korea foreign ministerial talks," the top government spokesman 
said at a news conference. 
  But Kumagai hastened to add that the schedule has yet to be 
fixed and the planned session does not necessarily aim to 
discuss the two countries' response to North Korea's alleged 
push for nuclear arms. 
  It will be meaningful to exchange views at a high-level, he 
noted. 
  Kumagai said he will discuss the planned talks with South 
Korea when he meets with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and 
Kakizawa later Monday. 
  Hata, Kakizawa and Kumagai meet on Monday night to listen to 
a report from Shunji Yanai, director general of the Foreign 
Ministry's Foreign Policy Bureau, who represented Japan at 
trilateral talks with the United States and South Korea last 
week. 
  At that time, the three countries adopted a united front and 
urged the U.N. Security Council to take prompt action against 
North Korea, including the consideration of economic sanctions.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa will leave for South Korea next Saturday [11 June] for 
bilateral talks expected to focus on the North Korean nuclear 
issue, government sources said Monday. 
  The move follows Saturday's talks in Washington between 
high-level officials of Japan, South Korea and the United 
States, where it was decided to urge the U.N. Security Council 
to consider possible sanctions against North Korea. 
  The sources said Kakizawa and South Korean Foreign Minister 
Han Sung-chu would meet next weekend to discuss the prospect of 
Security Council sanctions and of unilateral sanctions by the 
three countries if the council fails to act. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito told a press conference 
earlier in the day that Japan wants to hold the foreign 
ministerial meeting as early as possible, considering the 
heightened tension relating to the issue of North Korea's 
alleged nuclear weapons development program. 
  But he said Kakizawa and Han would be discussing a wide 
range 
of issues, in what will constitute a regular foreign ministerial 
meeting. 
  The previous such meeting was held in September, when Han

  Meanwhile, Kakizawa, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai were scheduled to meet Monday 
night to listen to a report from Shunji Yanai, director general 
of the Foreign Ministry's Foreign Policy Bureau, who represented 
Japan at last weekend's trilateral talks.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- Washington is not 
considering military options against North Korea for its refusal 
to allow checks of its nuclear facilities and will work through 
the United Nations, a senior Foreign Ministry official said 
Monday [6 Jun]. 
  Yutaka Kawashima, director general of the Foreign Ministry's 
Asian Affairs Bureau, was responding to concerns posed at a 
House of Representatives Budget Committee hearing that the 
United States was considering independent sanctions. 
  "The concern of the U.S. Government has been squeezed down 
to 
how to respond through the UN Security Council and there was no 
thinking about military options," Kawashima said in response to 
a question. 
  Kazuo Kitagawa, a member of coalition component Komeito, had 
asked Kawashima about remarks made by U.S. Secretary of Defense 
William Perry in a U.S. television interview that it is possible 
that independent sanctions may be imposed on North Korea by 
countries involved in the issue. 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said that Japan will provide its 
efforts through a number of routes, while noting that Tokyo is 
seeking a negotiated resolution to North Korea's refusal to open 
its nuclear activities to full international inspections. 
  Hata, speaking at the same committee sesssion, said Japan 
will cooperate with the international community "within the 
limits permitted by the constitution" if the UN should decide to 
impose sanctions on North Korea.

  [Text] Washington, June 3 KYODO -- Japan and the United 
States ended yet another round of "framework" trade talks Friday 
[3 June], this time with officials trying to sort out 
differences on how to measure progress of imports to Japan in 
automobile trade. 
  Japanese officials said the two days of talks focused on the 
thorny issue of "objective criteria," the very roadblock that 
scuttled the "framework" negotiations in February. 
  Japan and the U.S. agreed last week to resume the trade 
talks 
and expert-level government officials from the two countries 
have been meeting over the past week, both in Tokyo and 
Washington, to take stock. 
  While officials declined to comment on the substance of 
their 
discussions, there were indications that the two sides still had 
trouble working out a mutually acceptable formula to quantify 
market access to Japan. 
  One difference that has surfaced since the two countries 
decided Monday last week to resume the framework talks concerns 
the number of auto dealerships handling foreign cars. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has cited the number 
of foreign car dealers in Japan as a kind of "objective 
criteria" to determine whether Japanese consumers have equitable 
access to foreign cars. 
  "For us, that amounts to a numerical target, something we 
agreed that should have no place in the framework," a Japanese 
official said. 
  Japanese officials emphasized, however, that the negotiators 
involved in the two days of auto trade talks in Washington were 
not charged to make "political decisions." 
  That would be left to another round of meetings that has 
been 
tentatively scheduled next week in Tokyo between Sozaburo 
Okamatsu, vice trade minister for international affairs, and 
Undersecretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten, the two principals in 
charge of the "framework" negotiations for the automotive trade 
sector. 
  Apart from auto trade, other industry sectors covered in 
this 
week's talks were the insurance industry and Japanese Government 
procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment.

  [Text] Paris, June 7 KYODO -- The Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is opening its 
two-day ministerial council meeting at its headquarters in Paris 
on Tuesday [7 Jun]. 
  The main items on this year's agenda include ways to improve 
the economy and measures to increase employment within the 
group, as well as strengthening multilateral trade systems. 
  With the total number of unemployed within the group topping 
35 million, discussions will focus on promoting structural 
changes in industries and creating new business opportunities to 
increase new jobs, according to meeting sources. 
  Jean-Claude Paye, secretary general of the organization, is 
expected to issue a special statement after the meeting to urge 
members to job-creation programs within two years, the sources 
said. 
  On trade matters, the OECD will call for early ratification 
of the Uruguay Round trade accord which was completed last 
December after seven years of negotiations under the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  The participants will then discuss trade issues outstanding 
after the Uruguay Round, the sources said. The issues concern 
relationships between trade and five other areas -- the 
environment, competition, labor standards, investment and 
regionalism. 
  With Mexico participating as the OECD's newest member, the 
Paris-based group now gathers ministers and representatives from 
25 nations in the world. 
  On the second day of the meeting, Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev will be invited to sign the first agreement on 
economic assistance, the sources said. 
  Japan has sent Nobuo Matsunaga, the government's 
representative for external affairs, to the meeting. Schedules 
of the Diet sessions prevented a minister from being sent. It 
is the first time in 27 years that Japan has not sent a minister 
to an OECD meeting. 
  According to Japanese trade sources, Matsunaga is expected 
to 
meet with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who is also 
attending the OECD meeting, to discuss schedules for the ongoing 
Japan-U.S. trade framework talks. 
  A meeting set initially between Matsunaga and U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher has been canceled, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- U.S. Undersecretary of 
Commerce for International Trade, Jeffrey Garten, urged industry 
deregulations during talks with a Japanese business leader on 
his visit to Japan on Tuesday. 
  Garten told Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the Federation of 
Economic Organizations (Keidanren), that the United States would 
like to know how it can help Japan's deregulation. 
  He noted that numerous proposals are being made in Japan's 
industry, but that it is doubtful that they will actually be put 
into action. 
  In response Toyoda expressed enthusiasm for deregulatory 
measures, saying, "We must go forth with deregulation even if it 
hurts." He said he hoped the U.S. Government would let it be 
widely known that deregulation will lead to more business 
opportunities. 
  Toyoda also said that he is pressing the government to set 
up 
a surveillance body to oversee deregulation. 
  On the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, Garten said he 
expects it will take some time before the discussions make 
progress. 
  The U.S. official implied that the Japanese Government 
should 
continue making income tax cuts, pointing out that fiscal 
measures taken so far are insufficient to encourage domestic 
demand.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori on Tuesday solicited Japan's continued support for his 
country's bid to become a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum. 
  Fujimori, who arrived in Japan on Sunday for a four-day 
unofficial visit, made the call in a meeting with former Prime 
Minister Toshiki Kaifu, aides to the Japanese political leader 
said. 
  Kaifu was quoted as saying that APEC, established in 
November 
1989 as a loose consultative body, should be open in nature. He 
offered to convey Peru's desire to concerned parties. 
  APEC, which currently has 17 members representing about 40 
percent of the world's population, agreed last November to 
freeze new membership for three years. 
  It links Australia, Canada, Brunei, China, Hong Kong, 
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, 
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand 
and the United States. Chile will be made a full member at an 
informal summit in November. 
  While Japan has urged fellow members to allow Peru to 
participate in the forum's working group meetings, no consensus 
has been reached on the matter. 
  Fujimori is due to leave Wednesday for China for an official 
visit.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
pledged Monday [6 Jun] to root out corruption related to public 
construction works by replacing the traditional designated 
bidding system with an open bidding system. 
  "Public construction works must have trustworthiness and 
transparency," said Hata, answering questions at the House of 
Representatives Budget Committee. "Successive scandals were 
regrettable." 
  "We are taking measures such as a full-fledged introduction 
of the competitive bidding system. We will constantly carry out 
the measures in order to get rid of bid-rigging and other unjust 
practices," he said. 
  In April, prosecutors announced the end of 13 months of 
investigations into a series of bribery scandals involving 
politicians and major construction firms. 
  A total of 32 people -- including a Diet legislator, two 
governors, two mayors and officials of eight major construction 
companies and a large paper manufacturer -- were indicted as a 
result of the investigation.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- The Japanese economy is 
heading in a better direction with "slight changes in nuance" 
evident in assessments of its performance, Finance Minister 
Hirohisa Fujii said Tuesday [7 Jun]. 
  Industrial output is near to bottoming out and inventory 
adjustments are also improving, Fujii told a news conference 
after a morning cabinet meeting. 
  Fujii had been saying that the economy is mixed with good 
and 
bad signs and that experts were split in their assessments. 
  The cabinet adopted a monthly economic report at the morning 
meeting. 
  The June report prepared by the Economic Planning Agency 
stressed emergence of improving areas in the still-sluggish 
economy. The previous report had emphasized the sluggishness of 
the economy although noting some signs of improvement. 
  Fujii also said that international organizations are 
forecasting a recovery in the second half of 1994 for the 
Japanese economy in their latest economy reports. 
  He particularly cited reports by the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on Monday and by the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in April. 
  The two institutions said in separate reports that the 
Japanese economy will pick up in the second half from sluggish 
growth in the first half to post a real 2 percent growth in 1994 
before staging a full recovery in 1995. 
  To back up the improving outlook at home and abroad at "this 
delicate time," Fujii stressed the importance of steadily 
implementing the fiscal 1994 budget and the government's record 
15.25 trillion yen stimulus package launched in February. 
  The long-delayed budget for the current year that started 
April 1 is expected to pass the House of Representatives on 
Wednesday, with deliberations in the House of Councillors to 
begin the same day. The government is now running under a 
provisional budget. 
  Turning to the issue of possible economic sanctions against 
North Korea, Fujii said it all depends on the UN Security 
Council. 
  He cited the move to stop bank remittances to Iraq during 
the 
Persian Gulf War in 1990 as an example of the Finance Ministry's 
experience in complying with UN resolutions.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Trade Minister Eijiro Hata 
said Tuesday [7 Jun] that the Japanese economy has been showing 
some bright signals and predicted there is little chance of it 
sagging again. 
  Hata, minister of international trade and industry, told a 
regular press conference after a cabinet meeting that he is 
paying especially close attention to consumer-spending-related 
economic indicators such as sales at department stores and 
supermarkets. 
  Hata's remarks followed the latest official economic 
diagnosis issued by the Economic Planning Agency earlier in the 
day, which said some bright signs are visible in Japan's economy 
despite overall sluggishness.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 6 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia and 
Britain will look into the possibility of signing a memorandum 
of understanding (MOU) between trade organisations of both 
countries for further collaboration in trade services, Deputy 
Minister of International Trade and Industry Chua Jui Meng said 
Monday. 
  He said the MOU between Malaysia External Trade Development 
Corporation (Matrade) and British Board of Trade (BBOT) would 
allow exchanging information on areas such as market 
intelligence and training. If the MOU is signed, we would be 
able to have the British assistance in exporting our trade 
services abroad as the country was considered as a significant 
trade in services, he told reporters this after holding 
discussion with British Trade Minister Richard Needham at his 
office here. 
  Needham is on a four-day official visit to Kuala Lumpur 
beginning June 4, his third official visit in nine months. He 
is accompanied by three officers and 19 senior British 
businessmen. 
  Chua said that Malaysia is a strong importer in services and 
as at last year, its imported services amounted to US $7.7 
billion, which put Malaysia on the number 21 spot as the world's 
largest importer of services. 
  Since we do not rank in the top 25 countries that export 
trade services, we have been encountering deficit in trade 
services, he said adding that Malaysia's deficit in trade 
services was RM [Malaysian ringgit] 14.4 billion (about US $5.76 
billion) last year. 
  Chua said the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) scheme 
which urged Western nations to source for automotive parts 
abroad, also augured well for Malaysia's automotive industry. 
  Malaysia's automotive industry had been making an important 
on the local front as well as abroad especially with the 
production of the first national car and the second national 
car, said Chua. 
  This new policy will be a boost for our automotive trade as 
we have exchanged ideas with the British on the possibility of 
setting up an automotive parts and components industry in 
Malaysia, he added. 
  He said with the set up, the two countries could work 
together in terms of joint venture or technology licensing 
whereby the British would transfer their technology to Malaysia. 
  It would also enable Malaysia to be the regional centre for 
production and export of automotive parts and components, he 
added. 
  Meanwhile, Needham said the British Government would 
continue 
to send trade missions here regardless of the action taken by 
Malaysia not to award government contracts to British companies 
recently. 
  We are determined to continue to show our interest in 
Malaysia and the best way of doing that is to continue sending 
trade missions here, he said adding that there will be another 
six trade missions on the way. 
  He said Britain had vast interests in Malaysia and what 
other 
way of showing that than by setting up joint ventures between 
companies of both countries, form British companies in Malaysia 
or any other possible way. 
  Understandably, with our history of long relationship, we 
encountered problems but I believe that it can be worked out for 
the benefits of both countries, he added.

<F P=106> [Station Commentary] </F>
  [Text] Media report that Malaysia is providing arms to 
Bosnia is indeed damaging. The allegation is completely untrue. 
It goes against the very principle of Malaysia's policy of 
neutrality and upholding peace. No doubt Malaysia has been very 
vocal in calling for the arms embargo on Bosnia to be lifted. 
This is only because it will give a chance to the Bosnian 
Muslims to defend themselves against Serbian atrocities. 
  Malaysia is not alone. Even President Clinton recently said 
the United States was all for the lifting of the embargo. But 
never at any time has Malaysia gone against the resolution laid 
down by the United Nations. Against such a backdrop, it is 
indeed puzzling as to the true motive of the report. What is 
more disheartening is that the report was not filed by tabloids 
more interested in sales, but by a well-respected international 
cable network. 
  That is why Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed 
points out Malaysia is not in the gun running business. Perhaps 
the allegation could have come because Malaysia was providing 
arms to its 1,500 soldiers serving in the United Nations 
Protection Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina. If there are others 
providing arms to the Bosnians, it is certainly not Malaysia. 
It is also unbecoming of the network not to publish Dr. 
Mahathir's denial of the alleged provision of arms. 
  As a result, the international community might have the 
wrong 
impression. If any media group wants to have credibility, it 
should always provide a fair and balanced viewpoint. This 
surprisingly is not the case this time as far as the report on 
Malaysia is concerned. There are also doubts as to the 
credibility of the source. So far, there seems to be no 
concrete evidence to the allegation. Also, Malaysian 
peacekeeping force had been told not to engage in any warfare. 
Their job is to keep the peace and preserve the safe havens. 
  The UN has praised Malaysian soldiers for their exemplary 
attitude in discharging their duties. Despite the allegation, 
Malaysia is undaunted in its efforts to see peace come again to 
the former Yugoslavia. Most importantly, it wants the UN to be 
more forthcoming in efforts to help the long suffering Bosnians. 
  Strangely, the world body seems to be dragging its feet in 
this matter. In the meantime, this is giving leeway for the 
Serbs to continue the vicious campaign to eliminate the 
Bosnians. This is not fair and it certainly warrants being 
highlighted by the media. But if certain sections of the Western 
media due to reasons known only to themselves resort to untruth 
and speculation, it is not going to help matters. 
  The international community must know the atrocities the 
Serbs are committing, but if they are misled, measures to 
galvanize efforts to put pressure on the Serbs will be that much 
harder. Media groups have to demonstrate greater responsibility. 
Resorting to sensationalism and false report might jeopardize 
what little exercise [is] being done now to save the helpless 
Bosnians. If that happens, then those media organizations are 
as guilty as the Serbs in the brutal suppression of the unarmed 
Bosnians.

    [Editorial Report] The 8 May Kuala Lumpur UTUSAN MALAYSIA 
in Malay on page 6 reported that Malaysia and the Philippines 
plan to legalize cross-border entry in an effort to reduce the 
influx of illegal aliens, which has strained relations between 
the two countries. During a meeting in Manila, the Joint 
Committee on Border Cooperation also discussed measures to 
combat piracy, smuggling, hijacking, and drug trafficking 
activities, and to ease the entry of goods. Although details of 
the proposed legalization as well as other guidelines are still 
to be finalized during another meeting later this year in Kuala 
Lumpur, both sides hope that an agreement can be implemented by 
January 1995. Estimates put the number of illegal Filipinos in 
Malaysia at about 1 million. Most of the illegal aliens are 
concentrated in the state of Sabah, a few hours away by boat 
from the Philippines' southern island of Mindanao.

<F P=106> [By Paul Jansen and Derwin Pereira] </F>
  [Excerpt] Singapore has taken the first steps to have its 
own satellites in space -- a goal likely to be reached by 1999. 
  It has asked the International Telecommunication Union, a 
United Nations body regulating the use of satellite orbits and 
transmission frequencies for six slots, the union told THE 
SUNDAY TIMES. 
  The satellites Singapore has in mind will have channels 
capable of redirecting television shows, telephone telegraphic 
and other communications to vast areas across Asia. 
  Confirming the applications, Mr. Lim Choon Sai, director 
(radio) of the Telecommunications Authority of Singapore (TAS), 
said: "Though there is very little domestic need for satellite 
communications in Singapore, we do require good and efficient 
telecommunications with other countries because of our extensive 
trade activities and the external economy policy." 
  Having its own satellites was also "a logical step" for 
Singapore which has become one of the telecommunication hubs in 
the world, he added in response to questions from THE SUNDAY 
TIMES. 
  The applications for the slots were filed by TAS, the 
regulator of telecommunications development in the Republic. 
The first application was made in August 1992 and the second in 
November that year, Mr Lim revealed. 
  Each application was for three orbital slots 22,235 mile 
(35,576 km) over the Equator known commonly as geostationary 
orbits. One of the slots is over Singapore and the rest over 
the Indian Ocean. 
  Though TAS has filed for six orbits, it does not mean that 
six satellites will be launched. 
  First, exhaustive technical analyses have to be done to 
determine the likelihood of the new satellites interfering with 
the frequencies of other proposed or existing satellites. If 
this is likely, the countries concerned have to work out a 
compromise in involving modifications to orbits or frequencies. 
  Applications are likely to come to naught unless a 
compromise 
is achieved. 
  Reflecting the rush into space, the coordinating process can 
involve a number of countries and many meetings. Negotiations 
can take as long as three years. 
  Mr Lim said that for one of the orbits, Singapore will have 
to coordinate with 17 countries, including China, India, Japan, 
Indonesia and Malaysia. 
  But there is a deadline: a satellite must be launched within 
six years after its application has been filed though extensions 
are sometimes granted. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Members of the armed organizations in the jungle are 
attacking passenger cars, trains, and vessels with small and 
heavy weapons for no apparent reason. They are also disturbing 
and hindering the local tranquility as well as secure and smooth 
transportation. 
  Nearly 30 members of the jungle-based Karen armed 
organization attacked Bo Aung Kyaw passenger car at 0730 on 2 
June with small and heavy weapons near Kawlon Gyun. Due to the 
callous and wicked attack, a monk and two women passengers were 
killed by gunshot wounds while six others -- U An Gu, 45, of Hto 
Ant Village; U Hla Shwe, 40, of Kamamaung Ward No. 6; Daw Ma 
Tin, 70, of Ward No. 7; Daw Tin Sein, 45, and and Daw Win Than, 
31, of Ward No. 5; and Ma Aye Mya, 9, of Pinma Village -- 
sustained serious wounds from heavy weapons shrapnel and shots 
from small weapons. 
  The responsible personnel took the injured immediately from 
a 
village dispensary to a hospital for treatment. Local military 
columns, People's Police Force, People's Militia, responsible 
personnel from the respective law and order restoration 
councils, and local residents are collectively searching for the 
members of the jungle-based armed organization who committed 
this callous and wicked attack.

  [Commentary from the "Guest Column" by Omar Farouk: "A New 
Post-Socialist Burma"] 
  [Text] Irreversible changes are taking place in Burma after 
the "Young Turks" quietly forced the retirement of "the last 
surviving soldier from the socialist era," General Saw Maung. 
My recent visit to the country revealed that Ne Win's socialist 
revolution is over. Karl Marx is out; Gautam Buddha is in. 
  Since early 1992 Slorc [State Law and Restoration Council], 
led by a new generation of officer corps, has been reversing the 
negative and ruinous policies of the now-defunct Burma Socialist 
Party Programme (BSPP) that ruled Burma with an iron fist for 26 
years. Under the Marxist-oriented socialist dictatorship, there 
was told repression: [as published] politically, economically 
and socially. Today, the degree of personal though not 
political freedom has expanded enormously in Burma. 
  Social Changes: It's ironic but true that the 
people are much freer today than they were under the one-party 
socialist dictatorship. The powerful neighbourhood People's 
Councils, which spied on the people for the party, have been 
dismantled and replaced by citizens at the grassroots level. 
  Burmese no longer need 14-day permits for internal travel. 
Once-forbidden border zones are now open to traders. Burmese 
embassies now issue "visit visas" to former Burmese citizens; 
decades-old suspended and expired passports are now being 
renewed without any questions. Former Burmese nationals now 
have the right of citizenship. 
  Even dissidents have been allowed to visit the country. 
Former Prime Minister U Nu's daughter and her family were the 
latest visitors. Than Than Nu and her husband, Ko Nyein, vocal 
critics of the regime, were given back their passports. During 
the revolution, those who left Burma were branded as "traitors 
to the socialist cause" and were denied entry to the country -- 
for nearly three decades. 
  The exception was Aung San Suu Kyi. She had unrestricted 
entry to Burma during the "dark Burmese days." After all, the 
Burmese way to socialism was declared the continuation of her 
father, Gen Aung San's dream. 
  People have gotten back religion. There is more freedom of 
worship today. A Buddhist revival has spread throughout the 
land. Monks have been relegated to their former supreme position 
in society. 
  It's a bit of a shock to see the young generals prostrating 
before the Sayadaws (senior monks) in public. No one recalls 
seeing military or party officials bowing to the monks during 
the socialist era. To the party ideologues, the clergy were 
"meddlesome" and treated as "parasites." (Ironically, the monks 
were the first to accuse the BSPP of being communist.) 
  The Burmese Muslims are again free to use loudspeakers from 
the minarets. Visiting foreign pastors can now address their 
congregations in churches. Pilgrimages to Mecca and the Vatican 
are no longer a problem. The revolution of the mind has begun. 
  The Economy: From the very beginning of 
independence in 1948, Burmese leaders, both civilian and 
military, have been steadfast in building a socialist economy, 
with little or no room for capitalist institutions. This was in 
line with Aung San's thinking. The legendary Burmese 
independence hero was the founding member of the Burma Communist 
Party. U Nu and Gen. Ne Win were his comrades. 
  Under British rule, they were all leftists and "because 
capitalism had worked to their disadvantage, they mistrusted 
capital. And because capital is derived from profit they 
mistrusted profit as an incentive to industry. And they 
associated capitalism with foreign rule." 
  The civilian government of U Nu (1948-1962) preferred 
Western 
democratic socialism to communism. On the other extreme, the 
BSPP chose Marxist socialism, which led to formal adoption of 
the Sino- Soviet model of development and to a total denial of 
the role of private enterprise. 
  Slorc's switch from command to market economy has done some 
good for the country: life has returned to normal. Food and 
consumer goods have filled up the once-bare shelves. The people 
eat and dress better. The markets and bazaars are bustling. 
The sidewalks are full of hawkers selling goods from Thailand, 
China and India. 
  The department stores are stocked with electronics from 
Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore. The shops in 
Rangoon and Mandalay -- nationalised and shuttered for 26 years 
-- have opened with a zest and proudly display their signboards. 
  The military have turned into entrepreneurs, too: Tatmadaw 
[defense services]-owned department stores are now competing in 
Mandalay and other cities. 
  The kon-the (trading) class is once again respectable after 
being shunned, imprisoned and impoverished by the previous 
socialist regime. Today they count their profits and losses in 
dollars, baht and rupees. Under socialism, foreign exchange 
dealings were illegal and "economic saboteurs" faced the death 
penalty. 
  There are two currencies circulating in Burma today. One is 
the overvalued kyat and the other is the Foreign Exchange Unit 
or the "Burmese dollar" as the locals call it. The dollar 
coupons signify a de facto devaluation of the kyat. The coupons 
fetch slightly less than the US dollar, (the official rate is 6 
kyat to the dollar). Burmese can open foreign exchange bank 
accounts with the coupons and facilitate import and export. 
Burma today has turned into a giant re-export centre, tapping 
the two-billion-people market of China and India. To sum it up: 
it is no longer a crime to make a living in Burma. 
  The Burmese way to socialism turned from a Utopian dream 
into a nightmare. More people went to jail for "economic 
crimes" (black marketing) than for political dissent during the 
revolution. The people aptly nicknamed the infamous Insein Jail 
"Moscow." The Burmese say, in the Soviet Union criminals are 
sent to Siberia -- in Burma they send you to Moscow. 
  The socialist regime made up of fellow-travellers in the 
army 
and radical leftwing politicians -- brutalised a nation. In 
order to create "a new socialist society of affluence," people 
had their properties confiscated (nationalised), their money 
cancelled (demonetised). The private sector was dealt a death 
blow in 1964 when the entire economy was nationalised. These 
disastrous moves levelled the society, forcing the fiercely 
proud Burmese to beg, borrow and steal. Overnight, Burma became 
a nation of black- marketeers. 
  The "Young Turks": From all indications General 
Ne Win and his generation of nationalist army officers are 
fading away into history. Taking over the command are the 
younger generation of military officers. The "Young Turks" -- 
in their forties and early fifties -- have now moved into 
important posts replacing the half-educated veterans of the 
Burmese nationalist struggle for independence. 
  Graduates of the Maymyo military Academy and the Officers 
Training Corps, the new commanders in the past never saw 
eye-to-eye with the old guard. In July 1976, young army 
officers attempted to overthrow the socialist regime. The plot 
was discovered and the coup leader, Capt Ohn Kyaw Myint, was 
executed. Although unsuccessful, the coup plotters had 
denounced the socialist system. Since the removal of Gen Saw 
Maung, pragmatic changes have taken place: the economy has been 
unshackled, there is a thriving middle- class, fratricidal civil 
war is coming to an end, economic and social freedoms have been 
restored. Today, the military is devoid of ideology. Marxist 
jargon used by politicians, intellectuals and the military over 
the past half-century has been abandoned. 
  The draft constitution: The Burmese military is 
under fire for demanding a constitutional role -- like in Turkey 
-- that will fortify civilian rule. Most Burmese want stability 
and expect trouble once power is transferred to the political 
parties. Violence has been part of the political culture in 
Burma, mainly because of factionalism. It's bizarre but true, 
that the military takeovers in 1958 and 1962 were generally 
welcomed by even the most articulate Burmese. 
  It should not come as a surprise to observers if the 
military 
steps in again when the civilians take power and a violent power 
struggle erupts. 
  To many Burmese, the most important laws enshrined in the 
draft constitution are: the State shall not nationalise 
economic enterprises, and the State shall not make legal tender 
illegal (demonetisation) -- the twin evils that pauperised the 
nation. Both the democratic and Socialist constitutions of 1947 
and 1974 call for the nationalisation of "capitalist" 
enterprises. 
  NLD vs the Tatmadaw: The military is locked in a 
power struggle with the former BSPP members who now control the 
NLD [National League for Democracy]. Ex-members of the BSPP 
politburo now serve on the Central Executive Committee of the 
NLD. More than 80 per cent of those elected under the NLD 
banner are former BSPP members and purged military officers. 
  Slorc claims that Suu Kyi has been "hijacked" by the 
leftists. Some of these allegations are not totally baseless. 
It is no secret that one of her top advisers is a former 
communist, Thakin Tin Mya, an ex-member of BSPP Central 
Committee. He was arrested along with other hardcore ex-BSPP 
members. Not surprisingly, Slorc has cracked down hard on the 
NLD while other moderate parties have been left alone. 
  There are many disturbing questions facing Suu Kyi today 
which may resurface in the future to haunt her. Like, where was 
Suu Kyi when the thousands of fleeing Burmese lost everything 
during the socialist revolution: money, property, friends, a 
whole way of life, a country. 
  And the West and Japan must be held responsible for 
rewarding 
and supporting a brutal socialist regime for 26 years -- the 
most repressive in modern Burmese history. The kneejerk 
reaction today by the West to the situation in Burma is too 
little, too late. Plus, they are barking up the wrong tree.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jun 7 (BERNAMA) -- The contract for 
the purchase of Russian MIG-29 air superiority jet-fighters for 
the Malaysian Air Force was signed here today. 
  The multi-billion ringgit contract for 16 single-seater and 
two twin-seater MIG-29, ground support equipment and spare parts 
marked a significant breakthrough for Russian defence 
manufacturers into the Southeast Asian region. 
  The Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) would be the first air 
force in the region to operate the Russian frontline 
jet-fighters which would be delivered within 14 months. 
  The contract was signed between the government of Malaysia 
and the Moscow Aircraft Production Organisation (MAPO) and the 
state corporation for export and import of armaments and 
military equipment Rosvoorouzhenie Russia. 
  Finance Ministry secretary-general Tan Sri Mohamed Sheriff 
Kassim signed for the Malaysian Government while the Russian 
defence manufacturers were represented by MAPO director-general 
V. Kousmine and Rosvoorouzhenie director-general V. Samoilov. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, Defence Minister Najib 
Tun Razak and visiting Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg 
Soskovets, witnessed the ceremony held at the treasury. 
  Together with the contract signing, Malaysia and the Russian 
defence manufacturers also signed two memoranda of understanding 
[MOU] -- one, for industrial participation, and two related 
agreements. 
  Under the MOU for industrial participation, general areas 
for 
industrial cooperation with local defence industries would be 
identified while the second MOU was for the setting up of a 
technical services centre by a tripartite joint venture to 
provide technical support for the aircraft. 
  The two related agreements signed were for counter-purchase 
of US$95 million worth of Malaysian palm oil by Russia over a 
five-year period and the offset programme. 
  Under the offset agreement both sides should identify areas 
for transfer of technology to be implemented over a period of 10 
years. 
  Airod Sdn. Bhd. [Company Limited], the country's privatised 
aircraft inspection, repair and overhaul depot, and local 
telecommunications firm, Sapura Holdings, have been identified 
as recipients of the project.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 8 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia's 
purchase of MiG-29 jetfighters from Russia will provide the 
impetus for broader long term cooperation between the two 
countries, said Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg 
Soskovets. 
  He said both countries felt their partnership should not be 
limited to military and technological cooperation. 
  We have decided to set up a joint group of experts to study 
proposals from both sides and identify areas for future 
cooperation, he told a news conference Tuesday. 
  Malaysia Tuesday signed a US$550 million contract with 
Russia 
to buy 18 MiG-29 jetfighters, of which US$450 million will be 
paid in cash and the balance in the form of Malaysian refined 
palm oil over a five-year period. 
  Soskovets said he had a useful discussion with Prime 
Minister 
Dr. Mahathir Mohamed covering Malaysia's interest in Russia's 
high technologies in satellite communication, telecommunication 
and space studies. 
  On trade between the two countries, he said it was not 
sufficiently developed. 
  Russia might consider granting certain tariffs and custom 
duties to Malaysia in future trade, he added. 
  Soskovets also said the counter purchase of palm oil in the 
MiG-29 deal was very profitable to his country. 
  Russia, he said, was also interested in selling its weapons 
and military equipment to other countries in Southeast Asia. 
  The new Russian military doctrine emphasised the utilisation 
of its advantages in military technologies and to put them to 
commercial use. 
  Conversion is underway in the Russian defence industry... 
Many items are now discontinued but at the same time we should 
preserve the capacity in industrial and scientific potentials 
and to do this we should seek new markets, he said. 
  He said Russia's sale of combat weaponry in the world market 
had dropped tremendously compared to that of the former Soviet 
Union. 
  According to statistics of an international peace research 
institute, the former Soviet Union contributed some 38 per cent 
of world weapons sales against 30 per cent by the United States, 
he said. 
  Now Russian arms exports only comprised five per cent of the 
total compared to 60 per cent by the United States, he added.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Dispute Over Sipadan and Ligitan Islands </F>
Should Be Settled Cordially"] 
  [Text] The third meeting of the Malaysian-Indonesian Joint 
Commission for Bilateral Cooperation ended in Kuala Lumpur 
yesterday with the two sides agreeing that no development will 
be undertaken on the islands of Sipadan and Ligitan while talks 
are under way to seek a solution to the dispute. The two 
nations believe that the dispute over the islands should be 
settled immediately to prevent it from becoming a "thorn" that 
may undermine close bilateral relations. 
  Malaysia and Indonesia agree that there are no obstacles 
standing in the way of strengthening good relations and further 
expanding cooperation in any field. We are convinced that 
recriminations and heated arguments over international problems 
will not bring any benefit to either party, but would rather 
open the possibility of outsiders interfering in their internal 
affairs -- something which may complicate the situation. Of 
course, many parties are awaiting to take advantage of a rift in 
relations between Malaysia and Indonesia, which belong to one 
family. We are convinced that the strong solidarity of the 
Malaysian and Indonesian people and leaders cannot be easily 
overshadowed or eroded by self-interest or the interest of any 
party who does not understand the basis of the strong 
relationship, although the two nations are separated by the 
Straits of Malacca. Although the brotherly relationship was 
once undermined by a confrontation, their historical and 
cultural ties have since eliminated any useless prejudices. It 
is with this intimate relationship that we seriously want to 
establish a new force to face challenges and tackle various 
economic and political problems to serve our common interests. 
  Nevertheless, we feel that the island dispute has been 
dragging on unwarrantably although the matter has not been 
raised at the international level. Meetings and discussions 
have taken place alternately, but there has been no agreement to 
settle the matter. Indeed, it is not logical that the close 
relationship may be affected simply by the dispute over two 
small islands. As the islands are small, we hope that only few 
meetings will be needed to settle the matter in a very short 
time. Will lengthy discussions mean that the two sides are not 
being serious? Perhaps the postponement of a ministerial 
meeting from last Saturday until next year was indicative of 
their lack of determination and seriousness. The islands have 
commercial value and can be developed into tourist resorts and 
marine sports centers. Both nations recognize this potential 
and any delayed solution will surely inflict financial losses to 
both sides. 
  Nevertheless, we are convinced that Malaysia and Indonesia 
strongly hope that something positive will come out of a 
three-day meeting of the Joint Working Group on Sipadan and 
Ligitan Islands due to start in Jakarta on 7 September. We are 
strongly convinced that this trivial matter will be settled in a 
spirit of harmony and compromise if we are serious about seeking 
a solution. Izhar Ibrahim, director general for political 
affairs of the Indonesian Department of Foreign Affairs [name 
and title as published], who headed a 29-member Indonesian 
delegation, said that his country was committed to seeking 
whatever means is available to settle the dispute in a spirit of 
friendship. 
  In fact, the two nations have agreed on many matters at the 
negotiating table. Let's see cooperation in the automobile and 
aircraft industries, which have not only demonstrated the 
expertise of the Malay nations but have also contributed to 
ASEAN efforts to further enhance cooperation in Southeast Asia. 
We are also happy over Indonesia's full support for the 
establishment of the East Asian Economic Caucus [EAEC] and 
commitment to the establishment of a growth triangle covering 
Sumatera in Indonesia, southern Thailand, and the northern part 
of peninsular Malaysia, and over the fact that Indonesia has 
increased the frequency of sea and air traffic between the 
peninsula and Sumatera, encouraged the development of the 
financial services industry, and signed an investment guarantee 
agreement with Malaysia. Cooperation in trade, information, 
science and technology, agriculture, and tourism can be further 
developed to cover various new issues.

  [Text] Kuching, Tuesday -- The Parti Bansa Dayak Sarawak 
[Sarawak Dayak Race Party or PBDS] was officially readmitted 
into the Sarawak National Front, which the party quit in 1987. 
  The Sarawak National Front and PBDS signed a memorandum of 
understanding on the readmission into the front at Wisma Sumber 
Alam here today. 
  According to a press statement of the State Information 
Department here this evening, the memorandum of understanding 
was signed by Chief Minister Tan Sri Abdul Taib Mahmud in his 
capacity as chairman of the Sarawak National Front and PBDS 
President Datuk Leo Moggie, who represented the Sarawak National 
Front and PBDS respectively. 
  The document was drafted by the National Front-PBDS 
negotiating committee, which previously held several series of 
talks. 
  Witnessing the signing ceremony were Datuk Adenan Satem, 
chairman of the negotiating committee from the National Front, 
and PBDS Vice President Dr. James Masing. 
  PBDS, which was established in 1983, was a component of the 
National Front both at the federal and state levels until the 
party quit to join the opposition at the state level in 1987. 
PBDS remains a component of the National Front at the federal 
level. 
  PBDS sought to rejoin the Sarawak National Front for the 
first time following its severe defeat in the 1991 state 
election, but the Sarawak National Front gave no reply at that 
time.

<F P=106> [Commentary: "Opinion of Various Circles in Phnom Penh </F>
Voices Opposition to the Resumption of U.S. Interference in and 
Provocation of Cambodia's war"] 
  [Text] Circles both in Phnom Penh and the provinces have 
all been aware that the United States, on behalf of the alliance 
of Western powers, is canvassing military aid for the two-headed 
government to enable it to continue igniting the flames of war 
in Cambodia. Opinion of various circles in Phnom Penh is 
wondering whether in doing so the United States is pouring water 
to extinguish the flames of war, or is it adding fuel to them? 
  In so doing, the United States is certainly joining the 
communist Vietnamese in their aggression against Cambodia. The 
United States should know that giving money and supplying arms 
and materiel to the two-headed government can only benefit the 
communist Vietnamese. If the United States gives the two-headed 
government political and diplomatic assistance, the only one who 
will benefit from that will be none other than the communist 
Vietnamese. If the United States helps the two-headed 
government politically and diplomatically, only the communist 
Vietnamese will gain in their attempt to swallow Cambodia. That 
could be seen as a serious act of murder against Cambodia 
because the Western alliance would be helping the communist 
Vietnamese to annex Cambodia. 
  The United States should realize that this alliance, which 
is 
helping the communist Vietnamese to annex Cambodia, is running 
counter to the general trend. On the one hand, it could create 
more acute, insoluble differences with the Cambodian nation and 
people. It is incapable of doing away with the Cambodian nation 
and people because the United States would be creating conflict 
on top of conflict, thus driving the Cambodian nation and people 
to rise up simultaneously and fight back. At the same time, it 
could create differences with neighboring countries. If 
Cambodia became part of Vietnam, it would automatically be part 
of the Indochinese federation of the communist Vietnamese. As 
such, how dangerous a threat would that be to the ASEAN borders? 
  You do not have to look far. Just a few days after it had 
come to power, the two-headed government began to insolently 
lambaste other countries, verbally attacking its own neighbors. 
ASEAN in general wants to see Cambodia achieve reconciliation 
and peace and is opposed to any move that would give military 
aid for continuing to ignite the war because ASEAN realizes that 
should Vietnam succceed in swallowing up Cambodia, ASEAN would 
share its border directly with the communist Vietnamese, and 
there would be all kinds of problems to ASEAN's security. As 
far as United States is concerned, what could it gain from such 
a situation? 
  As for the differences within the nation and people, they 
are 
permanent. These include differences arising from the problems 
of land owenership, taxation, robberies, assassinations, and all 
kinds of power abuses, such as forcible recruitment and so on. 
These are utmost and permanently painful differences. No 
matter how much money the United States and the alliance is 
willing to give the two-headed government -- be it $100 million 
a month or $1,200 million a year or $2,400 million every two 
years -- these differences would never be solved. No wizard 
could ever solve them. Do not look at them as being differences 
with the 10,000-20,000 or 100,000 Khmer Rouge. Instead, look at 
them as differences between war and peace, as political, 
economic, and social differences created and continually 
inflamed by the communist Vietnamese, the alliance, and their 
puppets. 
  How can these differences be resolved? If one tries to solve 
them through war, one only multiplies them. If one tries to 
resolve them through national reconciliation, these differences 
might gradually dissipate, thus inviting peace and happiness 
back to the country and the national community. 
  The United States should not look at the Khmer Rouge as just 
a bunch of induviduals. It should look at them as the 
offspring, the flesh and blood of the entire Cambodian nation 
and people and especially of the nearly 7 million peasants. 
Attacking the Khmer Rouge is tantamount to attacking the entire 
peasantry, the entire Cambodian nation and people. The United 
States should reconsider whether it is better for Cambodia, the 
countries in the region, and the United States itself if it 
chooses the means of using water to extinguish the flames of 
war. This is a question that requires very close consideration. 
There should not be an error of judgment as the ones made when 
the United States decided to start the Vietnam war in 1960 and 
stage the coup d'etat in Cambodia in 1970 and when the communist 
Vietnamese decided to invade Cambodia in 1978-79.

Vietnamese Threat, and Why Has He Declared War Against the 
Cambodians Who Are Struggling Against the Vietnamese to Defend 
the Nation?"] 
  [Text] The present threat to the survival of Cambodian 
nation and race is: 
  1. The fact that Vietnam has nibbled a large part of 
Cambodia's territory and territorial waters adjacent to Vietnam. 
  2. The 4 million Vietnamese who are occupying and nibbling 
the remaining Cambodian territory with the goal of turning the 
Cambodian society and nation into Vietnamese as they did to 
Kampuchea Kraom [Cambodian territory annexed by Vietnam]. 
  All these constitute a grave threat to the survival of our 
Cambodian nation and race. How does Prince Ranariddh see this 
Vietnamese threat? Why has Prince Ranariddh declared war 
against the Cambodians who are struggling against the Vietnamese 
to defend the Cambodian nation and race? By so doing, does it 
mean that Prince Ranariddh is joining hands with the Vietnamese 
in their attempt to eliminate Cambodian nation? Does this mean 
that Prince Ranariddh is betraying the nation? By attempting to 
kill the Cambodians, to let the Vietnamese annex Cambodian 
territory, what heinous crime is Prince Ranariddh committing 
against the Cambodian nation and race? 
  The black book of Cambodia's history has recorded and will 
continue to record Prince Ranariddh's traitorous act in joining 
hands with the Vienamese to kill the Cambodians. The Cambodian 
nation and people condemn and will continue to condemn Prince 
Ranariddh and all of his descendants to come as they did under 
the reign of King Cheychettha II in the past. 
  The Cambodian nation and people who cherish their nation and 
race will not allow Prince Ranariddh, his colleagues, and the 
Vietnamese aggressors to kill the Cambodian nation and race.
