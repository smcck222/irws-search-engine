"Establishment of a Watchdog System: Integration and Abolition 
With Cost Awareness"] 
  [Text] 1. Instead of "bureaucrat-bashing" focusing on the 
individual behavior of bureaucrats, a cool diagnosis and 
prescription focusing on the system are necessary. 
  2. Among the suppliers of services, the government agencies 
are monopolists with power capable of forcing expensive and 
low-quality services on the consumers. Although they are 
monopolists who are difficult to control, a system to check 
their abuses is lacking, and the crux of the problem is the 
defenseless plight of the consumers. 
  3. It is necessary to demolish the systems that are not 
worth 
continuing, to promote deregulation and private management as 
much as possible, and to enhance transparency and increase 
scrutiny of work content in the remaining aspects. It is also 
important to change the traditional emphasis on generalists and 
to improve the quality of services in order to cope with 
increasingly complex tasks by stressing the use of specialists 
and promoting exchanges with the private sector. 
<H5>  Problems in the System; Long Lines at Art Museums </H5>
  This spring, a number of events took place, including the 
rice uproar and the abrupt resignation of the prime minister. 
Others were hikes in public service charges and a seven-hour 
wait at the Barnes Collection exhibit at the National Museum of 
Western Art in Ueno. The successive hikes in public service 
charges were criticized as dashing hopes for a business 
recovery. However, let us focus on the evils of monopoly in that 
the incentive to reduce costs is weak, given the fact that cost 
can be transferred to price. The fear of being kicked around if 
one is off guard and being free from the pressures of 
competition are such evils and are not limited to public service 
charges. 
  At the exhibit hall at the National Museum of Western Art, 
in 
addition to the standing frustration among people who can only 
attend on weekends due to their work, if there is such a great 
demand, why are the exhibit hours not extended into the 
evenings? With set costs of display items and the exhibit floors 
already paid for, the satisfaction of the users should be 
greatly enhanced by bearing the variable costs. In a normal 
enterprise, an all-night operation of a three-shift system would 
be considered in order to improve earnings by raising the rate 
of facilities operation. 
  The reason for beginning the bureaucracy debate with these 
topics is because the focus should be on the circumstances and 
the system in which the bureaucrats are placed, rather than on 
the people called bureaucrats. We do not think that the 
bureaucrats as a whole are a special existence. There is a 
tendency for the bureaucratic debate to be called 
"bureaucrat-bashing" by focusing on concrete cases, but it is 
inappropriate. The focal point of examination is the system and 
not the individual members. Instead of lecturing the cat that 
ate the fish placed before it, the reason should be considered 
and an appropriate measure should be adopted. 
  If the work of the bureaucrats is seen as providing 
services, 
the government agencies are not different from monopoly 
enterprises. What is different is the difficulty for private 
monopolies to provide effective abuse-prevention measures. 
Monopoly profits breed potential competitors and are not easy to 
maintain in the long term. They become subject to government 
scrutiny and regulation as in the case of public service 
charges. If stronger support is won from the consumers with 
reduced costs and the profits are boosted, they become 
incentives for increased returns and stable employment. 
  Despite the recognition of regional monopolies like electric 
power companies, the first point is met by a contention that 
they should be open to new participants and strong criticism 
against regulation of new entry through a licensing system. Even 
in cases where regional monopoly is inevitable, the contention 
that a franchise system should be introduced with a limited time 
of several years to induct the principle of competition follows 
this trend. The introduction of a price-cap system which 
recognizes room for discretion by regulated companies within a 
given limitation responds to the third point. 
  Such abuse-prevention steps are virtually nonexistent in the 
work of the bureaucrats. Also, virtually no learning effects are 
seen from the experience of a tragic end to an economy which 
placed the nation as a whole under a similar system. More 
satisfactory circumstances over a long term probably can be 
realized in the case of public service charges by the aggressive 
use of incentive functions, including the introduction of a 
price-cap system. 
  The characteristics of the work of bureaucrats appear more 
directly than in the case of the exhibit. When the seven-hour 
wait was known, did they imagine the existence of any tasks to 
cope with other than the prevention of accidents? We should ask 
the purpose of those persons responsible. Was there anyone who 
considered improving the satisfaction of the people, including 
those who gave up waiting in line? Are there any offices that 
heard the complaints or considerd instituting such improvements? 
Were there any persons who incurred any losses because such 
great dissatisfaction was ignored? Does any system exist to 
reward any person who might have won plaudits by responding to 
such dissatisfaction? 
  The case of the museum is merely a symbolic example. Why are 
the windows of the government offices open only during the 
daytime on weekdays? Why must the people take the trouble to go 
to the offices for their resident cards? It is necessry to 
recall the gripes which everyone once held. 
<H5>  Dearth of Specialists; Resistance to Change </H5>
  The aim of the monopoly enterprise is acquisition of profit. 
Because of an incentive to offer quality services at low costs, 
the design of a system that uses such incentives is relatively 
easy. It is necessary to note that, in the work of the 
bureaucrats, the abuses become enlarged due to their potential 
use of the power of enforcement in addition to their monopolist 
position. 
  The trouble and time to go to the windows, the annoying 
documents that are demanded, and coping with the almost abnormal 
concern with mistakes in the documents are serious costs for the 
users. In the case of museums, many people would probably give 
up the idea of going. 
  This phenomenon will surface to an extreme degree in the 
case 
of many categories of licenses and permits. The problem is that 
no office exists which is strongly aware of the fact that such 
costs should be reduced and which will control them. It is 
necessary to note also that such dissatisfactions do not merge 
into a loud voice. 
  There are probably many readers who saw dissatisfactions 
surface in concrete form in such cases as the Yamato Transport 
Co, E.K. Taxi, and Daiei Inc., and wondered why others in the 
industry did not express their frustrations. It is better not to 
voice them. In other words, if they are silently acquiescent 
because of the appeal of vested interests and the fear of 
authoritative retaliation, it is indeed serious. Of course, 
checks from the budget and accounting aspects for the prevention 
of swelling government budgets and squandering are not counted. 
  It is also necessary to note the decentralized authority 
system symbolized by the famous statement by Professor Emeritus 
Junichi Kyogo of Tokyo University, who stated regarding 
jurisdictional matters that the responsible divisions of the 
main ministry represent the Japanese Government itself. Even the 
private monopolies that share a common goal called profit suffer 
from the abuses of decentralization called the "main enterprise 
disease." In the government agencies which lack a clear common 
goal, the independence and abuses of the various sectors were 
greater. 
  The term of office of the responsible division director is a 
maximum two years, and it is difficult to expect the realization 
of a socially optimum services-supplying system that considers 
such costs. A newly appointed division director probably cannot 
even perform work similar to his predecessor without the 
cooperation of his subordinates and the representative companies 
under his jurisdiction. It is important because he will be 
demanded to set forth a new axis to make known his presence 
during his term of offfice, and to further contribute to the 
"ministerial interests." 
  Be it a division or a more subdivided office, or be it a 
bureau or a ministry, the essential problem is that a 
supervisory role over the content and cost of the services is 
nonexistent, and that an incentive to establish a supervisory 
system is also nonexistent or has not yet been established. One 
instance is the emphasis on generalists since the Meiji era and 
the flip side of contempt for specialists. 
  Financial administration led by securities administration 
has 
long been ridiculed in some quarters for its failure to 
establish a formation that is able to cope with the rapid 
changes and complexities of the industrial areas under its 
jurisdiction, and is barely able to recognize the changes within 
its scope of management. The reality is that the managers in 
electronics manufacturing companies are heard to say: "It is the 
same situation in our field also," so finance is not an 
exceptional case. However, it is cruel to say that they are 
inattentive to details. Under the present system, it is true 
that it is futile to pay close attention. 
  Some say that "Japan's bureaucrats are superior" or that 
"Kasumigaseki" is Japan's largest think tank." However, although 
it may be true about the superiority of its hardware in terms of 
the speed of its reaction and the large size of its memory, it 
should be recognized that the computer is just an ordinary box 
without the proper software. 
<H5>  Use of Outside Monitors for Overall Reorganization </H5>
  There is no all-purpose remedy to cope with the monopolist 
abuses of the bureaucracy. However, in the sense that there is 
no system with an aspect of using its authority to force its 
monopolist services, and scrutinizes and copes with the abuses, 
the first step in coping is to recognize that the decisive lack 
of cost-awareness is a conspicuous trait. 
  The beginning of a cure is an understanding that one has a 
serious illness and is exposed to the danger of further 
aggravation. It is also a sign of illness to retort against 
concrete criticism with such wornout phrases as "it will not 
work simply like painting a picture on a white background" or 
that "steady and gradual is preferable to sudden reform," and 
think that the matter has been settled. 
  There are various kinds of measures for coping. The first 
kind is the abolition of stations that have not produced 
benefits commensurate with costs in a broad sense. The second is 
the introduction of the principle of competition and a more 
aggressive use. The appropriateness of such expressions as 
privatization and private consignment aside, an example is their 
removal from the scope of the government office's work which is 
difficult to control, including a bold reexamination of the 
regulations. 
  The third kind is the introduction of outside monitors on a 
constant or periodic basis for an overall reexamination of the 
system. This involves public disclosure of the more concrete 
content of the bureaucrats' work and a strengthening of 
surveillance by the people through the Diet, for example. As in 
the case of private enterprise, the use of outside monitors may 
be worth consideration. Clarifying and fostering the role of 
specialists and active exchanges with the private sector also 
constitute a part of the measures. 
  It is not necessary to view the bureaucrats as a special 
breed of people, nor is it appropriate. The difficulty of 
controlling the quality of the services provided under the 
bureaucratic system and the cost levels should be frankly 
recognized, and a debate shold be started on the scope and 
design of an appropriate system. Many readers probably sensed a 
dissatisfaction which seemed unlikely to be remedied when they 
heard the statement by an official of the Food Agency around the 
time of the rice uproar that "the confusion would have been 
greater if we were not here." They would probably ask at least 
for some persuasive evidence.

"Efforts Needed To Check Negative Side of Japan's Bureaucracy; 
Politicians Need Improving, More Policy Expertise"] 
  [Text] 1. The bureaucracy is attracting attention because 
of its connection to various problems plaguing the Japanese 
Government. At the height of disarray, Japan's Government has 
fallen short of producing adequate policies to bring Japan out 
of its current recession, nor has it dealt satisfactorily with 
problems in its relationship with other countries. 
  2. A new way of looking at the bureaucracy is to see it 
particularly as a negative force preventing politicians from 
assuming leadership and as an obstacle to the "liberalization" 
and deregulation of the marketplace. These are also factors 
which may negatively affect attempts to strengthen Japan's 
democratic government. 
  3. These concerns are far removed from the view of 
bureaucrats as the formulators and implementers of public 
policy, or as those who hold the national interest in their 
grasp, or as a force driving economic development forward. The 
author explores to what degree and in which way such 
perspectives are valid and useful. 
  Broad Discretionary Authority Within Small 
Government 
  The original blueprint for Japan's present-day bureaucracy 
came out of the Tokugawa period [1603-1867] han 
system, which developed during Japan's transition from medieval 
to early modern times. 
  One of the characteristics of this system was that [in each 
han, or daimyo domain] the leading role in 
formulating and implementing policy fell to a select group of 
bureaucrats. Second, within the framework of "small 
government," this group was given broad discretionary authority 
in administering han affairs. A third characteristic was that 
these bureaucrats had a strong sense of mission and 
responsibility, taking full advantage of their physical strength 
as well as the power of their group to sustain itself over time. 
  It was natural that those who took the lead in formulating 
and implementing policy were members of the military ruling 
class. A class of officials like the "politicians" who emerged 
throughout the world during the 17th and 18th centuries, and 
particularly from the 19th century on, did not exist in Japan. 
Even when stripped of their weapons, Japan's samurai-bureaucrats 
retained their leadership role. Using local village leaders as 
intermediaries, they were to see that supervision was carried 
out at the grassroots level, that taxes were collected, and that 
improvements were made in the social infrastructure and were to 
encourage agriculture, commercem and industry. 
  The preliminary work of creating Japan's modern bureaucracy 
was undertaken from the mid-1800's, with the first stage of 
development completed around the beginning of the 20th century. 
Unlike this early modern bureaucratic system, which drew its 
members from the hereditary samurai class, the modern 
bureaucracy is based on nationwide competitive recruitment. 
  Still, even in the 1920's, half of Japan's bureaucrats were 
from the former samurai class. Although a parliamentary form of 
government was formed from around the end of the 19th century, 
thus bringing politicians and political parties into government, 
the bureaucratic system was largely unaffected and the 
bureaucracy still retained its leadership character. 
  During these early years, politicians tended to be branded 
as 
special interest, factious, and corrupt. For, even though the 
Meiji Restoration government was steadily pursing its goal of 
forming a parliamentary democracy, in policy matters, the 
bureaucracy was still one of the pillars of the new government's 
enlightened, authoritarian rule. 
  The Meiji Restoration government, like the earlier han 
government units, also pursued "small government." One of the 
reasons was the new government's weakened revenue base. Another 
important reason was that it lacked the ideology that would 
enable it to create "big government." This is a characteristic 
that has been carried over from the early modern period and only 
once did this tradition lapse. This was during the early half of 
the 1940's, when there was a temporary expansion of government 
powers in order for Japan to successfully wage war. 
  In the postwar period, the bureaucracy has also basically 
carried out "small government." If "big government" is 
characteristic of Western Europe, then "small government" has 
been realized by Japan and the United States. 
  That is not to say that an administration that seeks to 
contain government is a weak administration. On the books, 
Japan's bureaucracy may not necessarily have been given much 
explicit authority. However, it exercises considerable influence 
and discretionary authority, the result of its skillful 
manipulation of the "give and take" relationship between 
government and industry as well as past precedents and 
practices, including a tradition that produces ambiguously 
drafted regulations and flexibly interpretable laws. Thirdly, 
like enlightened, absolute monarchs, Japan's bureaucracy is 
characterized by a strong sense of responsibility and mission, 
and tends to see itself being called upon most particularly 
during periods of political upheaval and economic stagnation. 
This is understandable, given the bureaucrat's early connections 
to Japan's warrior class, and even in modern times, the 
bureaucracy, at least on this point, hasn't changed too greatly. 
  In time, bureaucrats no longer came from the same homogenous 
class background. At the same time, they were developing a sense 
of solidarity, which came from graduating from the same schools, 
etc., that proved to be a much stronger source of cohesion for 
the bureaucratic organization than class origin. 
  References to the stature and strength of the 
samurai-turned-bureaucrat of the early modern period may not 
strike us as very strange. In speaking of the modern-day 
bureaucrat, however, the reference is no longer to his physical 
strength but the stature he himself probably feels as a member 
of an elite class and as belonging to an organization that can 
be expect to take care of his well-being. When we think about 
how many years have been added to our lives after retirement, we 
can imagine how much of a boost to his morale it is when he can 
expect another job waiting for him when he makes his "descent 
from heaven." 
  "Lack of Impartiality" and Other Negative Criticisms 
Erupt 
  Most often, the emphasis until now has been on the positive 
aspects of the Japanese bureaucracy--that is, its responsibility 
in formulating and implementing influential public policy, its 
image as the impartial embodiment of the national interest, and 
its role in promoting economic development. 
  More recently, however, what is gushing forth like an 
unleashed dam are criticisms of the bureaucracy's negative 
aspects. First of all, there is a chain of criticism that sees 
bureaucrats as really considering it to their own advantage that 
government based on the party system is in a fluid, changing 
state; that they are preventing politicians from showing 
political leadership; and that they have come to take their own 
leadership role for granted. 
  Leadership is never more needed than at times of global 
confusion, and yet, according to these critics, public policy 
has gone off course because of [bureaucratic] inertia and 
self-interest. 
  Second, at a time when economies are moving toward global 
deregulation, Japan's bureaucracy is being accused of not taking 
the leadership nor changing what is apt to be a passive stance 
on deregulation and market liberalization and of thus creating 
more obstacles to this process than necessary. According to 
critics, it will be a matter of no small significance if, at a 
time when world economic rules are being re-done in the midst of 
a new world order, we merely assume the bureaucratic spirit will 
act to correct this passivity toward new rule-making and 
system-building. 
  Third, critics are saying that the priorities which the 
bureaucracy has recommended as remedies for Japan's economic 
slump are not necessarily the right ones and, in fact, may have 
only prolonged the recession. The criticism is similar to the 
one President John Kennedy made in 1961 soon after taking office 
when, meeting with opposition from fiscal and monetary 
authorities, he is said to have complained that they were 
"emphasizing a balanced budget more than the welfare of the 
American people." 
  Turning such negative arguments around, critics might argue 
that the government under its current party system has gotten 
too lax in its duties and the bureaucracy has taken up that 
slack, attempting to insure the continuity of government as well 
as to stabilize the economy and soften the medium and long-range 
impact of international adjustments. 
  In fact, the disorderly ebb and flow of party-system 
governments is only too common to many of the countries in the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD]. 
Such, for example, seems to be the case in the United States 
with the apparent confusion one finds in the Clinton 
administration, or in England under Prime Minister Majors, or in 
France under Prime Minister Balladur. Italy's political 
situation is the most fluid and unstable of all. 
  Undoubtedly these conditions are all tied to the worldwide 
slump economies are experiencing. At the same time, while we see 
a global movement toward liberalizing markets and establishing a 
global economy, we also note that within democratic governments, 
social interests are narrowly competing with each other within 
their own national borders. 
  Out of necessity, enterprises operate on a global scale, but 
those who have influence only within their own national borders 
and have relatively little competitive power must have political 
representation and tend to become a social presence that relies 
on the strength and support of government. 
  In the majority of cases, those social forces have access to 
political power; thus, what seems to be true throughout the 
world, in general, is that there tends to be an awkward strain 
between governments and economies. It is probably quite natural, 
especially within administrations which represents those types 
of social forces, for disputes to surface regarding economic 
policy. 
  Market Covers for Government Paralysis 
  The question is whether Japan's bureaucracy can stand up to 
those kinds of basic problems. It might not be at all strange, 
no matter how brilliant or full of missionary zeal young 
bureaucrats may be, for the negative aspects of bureaucracies to 
win out over their more positive aspects when those very 
characteristics are taken to the extreme. 
  The only saving hand for government is held by the market 
and--through the steady growth of market forces independent of 
the political activities of elected officials and bureaucrats 
and the competition between them--its ability to lessen the role 
of government itself. Certainly, in the short run, this lack of 
political leadership in economic negotiations with foreign 
countries will be a disadvantage. 
  However, it is also true that in the absence of an accord 
between Japan and the United States the market is continuing to 
develop on its own, and the recession and high yen have taken on 
the force of a surging wave, propelling Japan's manufacturing 
industry into direct investments to Asia-Pacific countries, 
especially China. 
  This direction will someday probably eliminate the trade 
deficit Asian countries have with Japan. The rapid development 
of the economies of Asian countries will also probably alter 
their relationship with the United States. Nor does it seem such 
developments will be greatly affected by the fact that 
"framework" talks between the United States and Japan have 
temporary stalled. 
  However, as long as one takes seriously the task of 
strengthening democratic government and as long as our actions 
to bring us closer to that end are important in raising the 
international level of confidence in Japan, then it is necessary 
to endeavor to keep the potentially negative aspects of Japan's 
bureaucracy from surfacing and coming too strongly into play. 
  To put it another way, an effective antidote is probably the 
one that improves the quality of our elected officials as the 
representatives of our interests. Restraining our bureaucrats 
will not lead to any solutions. Instead, we must not delay in 
cultivating and nurture elected officials who are capable, 
strong, informed, and well-versed in policy.

  [Text] TDK will boost its overseas production ratio to 50 
percent (38 percent as of end of fiscal 1993) with fiscal 1995 
as the goal (March 1996 quarter). It is a measure backed by the 
overseas production shift of finished goods manufacturers and 
worsening export profits due to the high yen, and it aims to 
achieve its goal by partially shifting production such as 
high-performance magnetic heads and high-frequency parts for 
mobile communications. The overseas production shift by the 
electronic parts industry seems to be accelerating further. 
  TDK's overseas production ratio in fiscal 1993 was 38 
percent, one point down from the 39 percent in fiscal 1992. It 
was affected by the reduction in amount of production along with 
the switch in magnetic heads for hard disk drives (HDD) and HDD 
IC [integrated circuit] types centering on overseas production. 
  In the plan to achieve the goal of "a 50-percent overseas 
production ratio in fiscal 1995," the program is to start within 
the fiscal year production of "MR heads," thin film magnetic 
heads for HDD, in the Asian region, in addition to beginning 
production of dielectric filters for mobile communications 
instruments at the ferrite plant in Oklahoma in the United 
States within this fiscal year. Both products are products that 
previously had been produced only domestically, and the aim is 
to achieve 50 percent in stages by raising the overseas 
production ratio to 42 percent at the end of fiscal 1994. 
  Moreover, in facilities investment, while holding it down 
domestically to about 15 billion yen this fiscal year, on par 
with last fiscal year, it is scheduled to increase facilities 
investment overseas by more than 20 percent compared to the 
previous year, to about 25 billion yen. In next fiscal year and 
thereafter, the idea is to expand the overseas production items 
with this basic stance. 
  The company is putting effort into avoiding exchange rate 
risks such as promoting a change of export transactions to a yen 
basis, besides establishing a budget this fiscal year at $1 to 
100 yen. By achieving a 50-percent overseas production ratio, it 
will have a balance with domestic production and the policy is 
to link this course thoroughly to strengthen the constitution of 
the business.

  [Text] "The Subcommittee on Pensions, Medical Care, and 
Other Welfare Work" [name as published] (chaired by Minoru 
Yanagida) under the ruling coalition's Tax Reform Committee 
[name as published] has disclosed the contents of its draft 
report on a vision for the social safety net and expenditures 
for the social net. The draft report says that under the 
current tax system, it is difficult to secure equitably obtained 
and stable financial resources for social security, which is 
necessary to create a welfare society. It says: "Basically, it 
is desirable to establish a fair revenue system through an 
increase in the ratio of indirect taxation." The draft report, 
however, expresses negative views on the introduction of a 
welfare tax. 
  The subcommittee is entrusting to another committee the 
decision concerning by what percentage indirect taxes should be 
raised. The other committee will reach a conclusion at a 6 June 
meeting and then will submit its decision to the Tax Reform 
Committee. 
  The draft report notes the need for realizing a stable 
pension system, streamlining medical care, and promoting 
quantitative and qualitative improvements in welfare work such 
as nursing for the future social security system. To create an 
ideal welfare society for the future, it proposes to promote the 
structural reform of a social security system to prepare for the 
aging and low-birthrate society. It also proposes that the 
"government" and the "private sector" cooperate in realizing a 
"high-quality welfare and equal- burden society." 
  The draft report also stresses the need to urgently review a 
"10- year plan for the promotion of health care for the aged 
(gold plan)," which is effective from FY 1990 until FY 1999, and 
to formulate a comprehensive plan to support child rearing 
(angel plan). It then provides specific measures to support 
nursing and rearing. 
  The draft report says it is necessary to flexibly consider 
appropriating some of the revenues from an increase in the ratio 
of indirect taxation for supporting nursing and child rearing. 
  As for financial resources for pensions, the report draft 
says: "The social insurance system should continue to be 
maintained." Touching on a call by the Social Democratic Party 
of Japan that the ratio of the national treasury's burden for 
basic pensions should be raised (from the current one third) to 
one half in the planned tax reform, the draft report says, "This 
issue should be discussed separately from a tax reform," and 
"This will be studied as a mid- and long-term assignment."

  [Text] On 2 June, the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI] disclosed that it plans to conduct a 
comprehensive review of its policies regarding the basic 
materials industry. Concerns have been voiced about the 
industry's losing international competitiveness brought about by 
the continued appreciation of the yen against other currencies. 
MITI hopes to indirectly promote mergers and tie-ups among 
businesses by re-examining the managing of the Antimonopoly Law, 
among other ways. It also plans to retain the industry's 
competitiveness through cost reduction methods and to improve 
the technological infrastructure to establish a technological 
information network. In the past, MITI has discussed industrial 
policies separately with individual industrial sectors. This 
will be its first effort at working out policies for the entire 
basic materials industry which transcends the boundaries of 
separate industrial sectors. 
  MITI plans to start full-fledged discussions by setting up 
early next month an "Informal Panel on Policies Regarding the 
Basic Materials Industry" to serve as a private advisory panel 
to the directors of the Basic Industries Bureau and the Consumer 
Goods Industries Bureau. The panel will consist of 
president-level officials from companies which manufacture basic 
materials such as steel, nonferrous materials, chemicals, 
cement, and paper and pulp. 
  The following topics comprise the pillars of the planned 
policy review: 1) improvement of the distribution system; 2) 
improvement of the technological infrastructure; and 3) 
contributions to an environmental-friendly society. 
  Comcerning improving the distribution system, MITI plans to 
take such measures as reviewing the managing of the Antimonopoly 
Law in order to laterally support mergers and tie-ups among 
firms which are being forced to streamline their operations as a 
result of poor business performance. In this way, it plans to 
enhance the industry's competitiveness. In addition, the 
ministry plans to propose setting up a system of commending 
firms which have been able to overcome the problems of 
maintaining excessive product quality and providing excessive 
services. MITI also plans to have a thorough investigation made 
concerning differences in commodity prices at home and abroad 
and to urge promoting deregulation to help reduce distribution 
and energy costs. 
  Regarding improving the technological infrastructure, MITI 
plans to establish safety standards for basic materials and 
chemical products. It also plans to encourage establishing 
databases and networks which deal with technological information 
related to the bio-technology field. 
  Computer chemistry has been considered essential to 
developing chemical substances. While this has been pointed 
out, Japan has lagged behind the United States. Therefore, MITI 
plans to respond to this situation by launching a state project. 
To break away from the malpractice of excessive quality 
maintenance, the ministry also plans to embark on developing new 
methods to gauge the durability of basic materials.

<F P=106> [Article by Raymond Whitaker: "Defiant North Korea </F>
Completes Cover-up"] 
  [Text] Defying international agreements, North Korea has 
almost completed the removal of 8,000 fuel rods from an 
experimental nuclear reactor, leaving the rest of the world 
divided on how to respond. 
  David Kyd, a spokesman for the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA), said the spent fuel is in a cooling tank 
monitored by two agency inspectors. There was no sign that the 
North Koreans had any immediate plans to take away the material, 
but he added: "Weeks or months -- that is a different matter." 
It is estimated that after reprocessing, the spent fuel could 
yield enough plutonium for three or four nuclear weapons. 
  Of more immediate concern, however, is that the inspectors 
have been prevented from taking samples to determine how much 
plutonium has been diverted in the past. The North Koreans 
admit to having produced a small amount, but the IAEA has 
evidence that more is being concealed -- enough, it is believed, 
for one or two nuclear devices. 
  "That historical record is now lost," a Western diplomat 
said 
yesterday. "There is no way of reconstructing it. North Korea 
has violated the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the only 
question now is how we react." 
  Apart from extinguishing any hope that Kim Il Sung's 
unpredictable Stalinist regime might finally comply with the 
treaty to the satisfaction of the IAEA, the unsupervised 
discharge of the reactor has made it clear that Pyongyang will 
proceed with its nuclear programme whatever the inducements on 
offer. Last year the United States held two rounds of direct 
talks with North Korea in which it offered help to rescue the 
country's collapsing economy and held out the possibility of 
diplomatic recognition if the North would stop trying to develop 
nuclear weapons. 
  "They were offered a perfectly decent fall-back," said the 
diplomat, "but they chose to sacrifice a third round of talks 
which was virtually within their grasp. The US was prepared to 
meet nearly all their conditions, but instead they chose to 
de-fuel." Some American analysts have argued that North Korea 
sees its nuclear programme as a cheap form of insurance against 
reunification with South Korea, which will remain effective no 
matter how far it falls behind the South in terms of economic or 
military strength. 
  Pyongyang's open defiance of the IAEA, making it impossible 
to check what it has done in the past, means there is no 
specific deadline for action. Disagreement among the five 
permanent members of the United Nations Security Council means 
it may not discuss the matter for several more days. 
  China, North Korea's closest ally, has prevented its 
Security 
Council partners from passing any resolution on the last couple 
of occasions the question has been debated. All it has been 
prepared to allow is a statement by the president of the 
council, urging the North Koreans to comply with the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty. "It would be a jump for the Chinese 
to agree to a resolution, and a further jump to agree to 
sanctions," said the Western diplomat. 
  Peking has given next to no sign of dropping its traditional 
opposition to sanctions in almost any circumstances, but the US, 
Britain and France are pressing ahead with drawing up proposals 
for their staged imposition on North Korea. The first round 
might include action to curb Pyongyang's exports of conventional 
weapons and cutting air links. Preventing imports of oil and 
food, which nearly all go through China, would not be proposed 
until later. Nor is it clear when Japan would be asked to stop 
all remittances from North Korean residents, worth about $600m 
(400m pounds) a year. 
  Nobody was under any illusions that sanctions would be very 
effective, said the diplomat, "but it is a question of 
credibility. The Western members have reached the conclusion 
that the Security Council cannot take this lying down."

  [Text] Medan, Jun 2 (ANEX/ANTARA) -- Indonesia on Thursday 
asked Malaysia and Thailand that a joint planning and studies 
should be conducted for the basic infrastructure development of 
the Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand Growth Triangle (IMTGT) 
cooperation project. 
  Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Industry and Trade 
Hartarto, during the third ministerial meeting of IMTGT 
cooperation, said that the joint investment for the basic 
infrastructure development will include the development of 
telecommunication and transportation systems. 
  He also said that beside the joint development projects, 
there are other four important factors that should be managed by 
the three countries themselves for the IMTGT cooperation. 
"First, all governments involved should provide a sustainable 
support for the sub-regional economic cooperation while striving 
to overcome handicaps that may hamper the investment and trade 
activities, both in and outside the region" he said. 
  He proposed that the governments involved should draw up a 
list of its development plan priorities so that proper steps can 
be taken to avoid conflicts with the IMTGT projects. 
  Hartarto also stressed the need for the three governments to 
discuss and adopt common regulations, laws and procedures for 
the IMTGT cooperation. Furthermore, the three governments 
should ask its private sectors to increase their roles in 
stimulating the IMTGT development project. 
  Meanwhile, Thailand Deputy Prime Minister for Economic 
Affairs Suphachai Phanitchaphak, shared the same view with 
Indonesia's, especially that which concerns the private sectors' 
important involvement in the development of the growth triangle 
area. 
  He also pointed out Thailand's strong commitment to the 
IMTGT 
cooperation, saying that they have started to conduct dialogues 
in the operational level. 
  "Operational level dialogues are aimed at establishing joint 
cooperation, particularly in trade and investment, integrated 
infrastructure development, and fishery sectors," the Thai 
minister said. 
  Malaysia's Minister Abdul Hamid Pawanteh, however, 
underscored the importance of increasing the quality of 
development for the integrated infrastructure in provinces 
within the IMTGT region. 
  On the occasion, the Malaysian minister expressed the hope 
that the next IMTGT meeting scheduled in September or October 
this year will be held in Penang, Malaysia. 
  IMTGT involves two Indonesian provinces of Aceh and North 
Sumatera, four in Malaysia, and five of Thailand's southern 
provinces.

  [Text] Medan, Jun 2 (ANTARA) -- Three ministers of the 
Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand growth triangle (IMT-GT) cooperation 
project have agreed to continue their fourth talks in Penang, 
Malaysia tentatively scheduled on September 28, 1994. 
  This was disclosed to the press by Coordinating Minister for 
Industry and Trade Hartarto in Medan Thursday following the 
conclusion of the third IMT-GT Ministerial Meeting which 
produced 11 memorandums of understanding on cooperation between 
the business companies of the three countries. 
  At the Penang meeting the three governments are expected to 
agree to further their talks on several matters relating to the 
improvement of investment and trade climate for an earlier 
realisation of the IMT-GT cooperation scheme, he said. 
  Minister Hartarto at the press conference attended by dozens 
of local and foreign news reporters, was flanked by the Perlis 
[Chief] Minister (Malaysia) Dr. Abdul Hamid Pawanteh and 
Thailand's Deputy Premier for Economic Affairs Dr. Supachai 
Phanitchaphak. 
  Hartarto said the three nations also agreed to continue 
their 
deliberations on the joint uniformity concept on the granting of 
various facilities to support businesses within the growth 
triangle. 
  The joint uniformity concept on the creation of a favourable 
business atmosphere covers uniformity in tariffs to be shared on 
the flow of goods, immigration, customs and excise, insurance, 
special passports and fiscal matters. 
  Sharing various views with Minister Hartarto, both Perlis 
Minister Dr. Abdul Hamid Pawanteh and Thailand's Deputy Premier 
Dr. Supachai Phanitchapak once again stressed the commitment of 
the three governments to fully support the realisation of the 
cooperation project. 
  In the meantime, Pawanteh reminded the need for the three 
governments to give an assurance on the definition of a number 
of terms in the IMT-GT cooperation scheme, such as free trade 
zone and border development region, to make it easier for the 
Asian Development Bank to conduct a feasibility study scheduled 
for completion in July. 
  The meeting of the businessmen and the ministerial 
conference 
held since May 31, have produced 11 memorandums of understanding 
(MOUs), which were signed in the presence of the Industry and 
Trade Ministers of the three countries, and also covered the 
construction of an international standard hospital in Medan. 
  The other 10 areas of cooperation included the development 
of 
television broadcasting facilities, electric power generation, 
meat import, fishery, the import and export of used aluminum and 
iron, the export and import of batik cloth, coal exploration, 
trade, and the construction of sea transport network.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The United States is Dispatching 90 Military </F>
Advisers and Military Specialists to Cambodia To Continue 
Fueling the War in Cambodia; Is This a Repeat of the Indochina 
War of the 1960's and 1970's?"] 
  [Text] There have been reports saying that the spokesman 
of the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh has announced that the United 
States is dispatching 90 military advisers and military 
specialists to Cambodia. 
  People still remember the history in Vietnam when the U.S. 
Government dispatched U.S. troops there in the 1960's -- the 
Vietnam War started. The U.S. Government dispatched hundreds of 
military advisers and specialists; more were successively sent 
until there were millions of U.S. soldiers there. In the 
Vietnam War, over 50,000 U.S. troops were killed; hundreds of 
thousands more were wounded. Thousands are missing and their 
fate remains a problem today. 
  Now the United States will start dispatching military 
advisers and military specialists to Cambodia to assist the 
two-headed government to continue fueling the war in the 
country. People are interested in this and have asked the 
following question: Is this a repeat of history? The Cambodian 
people do not need gasoline to pour over the fire; the Cambodian 
people need water to put out the fire. National reconciliation 
is water for putting out the fire. 
  The Cambodian people categorically oppose whatever helps 
fuel 
the war; they will absolutely not allow this. They will fight 
on until achieving national reconciliation and genuine peace. 
  The Cambodian people want to coexist peacefully and have 
friendship with the American people. The two peoples do not 
want war and do not want to kill one another. Therefore, 
solving the Cambodian problem for peace and national 
reconciliation will benefit the Cambodian and American people, 
and also the people of the region. Furthermore, nobody in the 
world wants to die in a war.

  [Text] Phnom Penh 10 Jun (AKP) -- "Russia will always 
continue its cooperation with the Kingdom of Cambodia, 
particularly in the restoration of the Phnum Kamchay hydropower 
plant in Kampot Province, 150 km southeast of Phnom Penh." This 
was said by the ambassador of the Russian Federation, Yuriy 
Myakhotnykh. 
  Received in Phnom Penh on 7 June by Samdech Hun Sen, second 
prime minister, the Russian diplomat added that the cooperation 
also deals with the exploration and extraction of gas and oil 
and the study of soil for agriculture and rubber plantation. He 
also revealed that in three months Russia will welcome Prince 
Norodom Sirivut, Cambodian deputy prime minister and minister of 
foreign affairs and international cooperation, who will pay an 
official visit to Russia to sign with the host country a 
cooperation agreement in the fields of economy, science, 
education, sports, and investment. 
  The mission of Yuriy Myakhotnykh will end soon. He has bid 
farewell to Samdech Hun Sen.

  [Text] On the morning of 8 June, Trade Minister Va Huot 
made a surprising outburst toward Economy and Finance Minister 
Sam Rangsi after the Economy and Finance Ministry issued Notice 
057, dated 28 May 1994, dealing with a new regulation to take 
effect on 1 July 1994. According to this notice, a number of 
goods will be subjected to testing before they can be imported 
into Cambodia. The Economy and Finance Ministry assigned the 
ITS and FTS companies to conduct the testing required by this 
notice. 
  Mr. Va Huot considered this action to be rude interference 
in 
the Trade Ministry's affairs. He and several top officials of 
the Trade Ministry's specialized departments called the new 
five-point regulation an error in judgment by the Economy and 
Finance Ministry. In its five points, the regulation says that 
crude oil, natural gas, all types of medicine and medical 
equipment, merchandise belonging or relating to the Royal 
Government, products categorized as relief or humanitarian aid, 
and so forth worth $1,000 or more must be inspected by the FTS 
company or another company called "Inchcape Testing Service 
International Limited," or ITS for short. 
  Mr. Va Huot stressed that the Economy and Finance Ministry 
should not interfere to this extent in the Trade Ministry's 
domain. The Economy and Finance Ministry's notice and regulation 
constitute a gross violation by one ministry against another. 
He claimed the regulation may have been initiated because the 
Economy and Finance Ministry wanted to dissolve some units under 
the Trade Ministry's jurisdiction. 
  Concerning the import and export of goods, the Trade 
Ministry 
already has all the necessary departments to check and test 
merchandise. As for the import of petroleum products, the 
testing of crude oil and natural gas has been carried out over 
the last dozen years by CAMCONTROL utilizing a laboratory 
purchased by the government for $100,000 to test imported 
petroleum products. 
  Currently, CAMCONTROL is coordinating its operations with 
France's DGCCRI, a major organization known around the world. 
This organization has cooperated with CAMCONTROL on the basis of 
an agreement signed in 1991. Up until now, the organization has 
assisted us in such tasks as the quality testing of counterfeit 
goods and drafting laws to control counterfeit goods. 
  A Trade Ministry official said: The most interesting thing 
is that our cooperation with an important organization 
recognized by the government has not even been concluded, but 
someone, instead of helping enhance this cooperation, is already 
seeking to usurp the rights and tasks of other agencies. What 
does this all mean? 
  Minister Va Huot added: "I have always supported every 
specialized department in the Trade Ministry." He went on to 
say that the Finance Ministry should have known what work has 
already been done in compliance with Royal Government decrees, 
meaning that the Finance Ministry should not seek to create new 
problems. If the Finance Ministry wishes to carry out any 
enterprises it deems beneficial to the national community, it 
would be commendable if the two ministries talked with each 
another first to bring progress and success to these important 
enterprises. 
  The minister also mentioned the agreement signed between the 
Finance Ministry and the French company Total, saying it is 
pressuring the CKC company under the auspices of the Trade 
Ministry into a joint venture with Total. Such a move can only 
create problems, he said. The Finance Ministry should not 
intrude in the Trade Ministry's domain. He wondered whether 
similar actions taken by the Finance Ministry in the past had 
ever born any fruit or seen any success at all. 
  It is not known yet whether Mr. Va Huot's reaction to Mr. 
Sam 
Rangsi was officially presented to the Royal Government. 
Nonetheless, we hope this disharmony will be settled by the 
Royal Government soon.

  [Text] Reliable sources at the Defense Ministry of the 
puppets say that Tie Banh [co-defense minister of the Royal 
Government of Cambodia] has embezzled about $10 million in 
foreign aid. Tie Banh has given some of this money to Hun Sen's 
wife and to Pol Saroeun [deputy chief of staff of the Khmer 
Royal Armed Forces]. The $10 million is part of around $50 
million provided by foreign countries for Cambodia's 
construction. However, allies have given advice to puppets of 
the communist Vietnamese and the two-headed government to divert 
this money to buy tanks, artillery pieces, and ammunition for 
launching military operations in the recent 16th dry season. 
  This information concerning Tie Banh's embezzlement of $10 
million came from a high-ranking puppet officer who has not 
received his share. This officer said that troops on the 
battlefields have not received their salaries and that they have 
no money, no supplies, no foodstuffs, and no medicine. They 
sleep in the rough exposed to rain and wind, while officers who 
are not doing the fighting have been amassing the money destined 
for the troops. These officers are exploiting the troops. The 
officer also said that he will try to find ways to expose to the 
public Tie Banh's embezzlement, information that is only known 
among the circles of high-ranking officers and puppet leaders.

  [Text] The newspaper PRUM BAYON NEWS has been closed 
forever. 
  Ieng Muli, information minister, issued a communique dated 7 
June forbidding Thai Sarun, alias Seng Sokhom, to continue 
publishing the newspaper PRUM BAYON NEWS. 
  This communique reached REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA on 7 June. It did 
not give any details about the offenses that PRUM BAYON NEWS had 
committed. The communique merely referred in general to the 
final provision of the Kingdom of Cambodia Constitution's 
Article 139, the Cambodian king's royal decree of 1 November 
1993 dealing with the appointment of the Royal Government of 
Cambodia, the press law of the State of Cambodia's National 
Assembly passed in its 6 April 1992 extraordinary session, and 
the ethical code of the Cambodian Journalists Association. 
Besides all of that, no other specific, detailed explanations 
were given. 
  Since Cambodia returned to democracy after the May 1993 
election, this has been the first time that a newspaper has been 
officially shut down by government authorities. It should be 
recalled that on 24 March Nguon Non, political director of 
DAMNOENG PEL PROEK, was jailed for two days for refusing to 
respond to a subpoena, and on 16 May the police confiscated all 
copies of SAKAL before they could be distributed on the grounds 
that this newspaper had disparaged the king, an act prohibited 
by the Constitution. 
  Concerning this worrisome incident, it can be said that the 
press in Cambodia is going through a frightening stage of 
destabilization. While commenting on this event, the optimists 
have pointed out that it was a correct measure taken by the 
Royal Government to help strengthen the journalistic profession, 
a step well in line with true democracy and necessary in a 
law-abiding country. Almost without exception, people 
disapprove of Cambodian journalists who are irresponsible to 
their profession. 
  At about the same time we have learned that two other 
newspapers might be closed if they continued to ignore the laws 
of the state, to spurn their professional conscience, to cause 
riots, to inflame public opinion due to old grudges or past 
scores to settle, and if they refused to respect the superior 
interests of the nation. 
  One Cambodian journalist has expressed skepticism, saying 
that the leaders are indulging in the questionable tactic of 
making certain statements intentionally for the press to report, 
and then issuing denials to discredit the press. Faced with 
such a ploy, Cambodian journalists will encounter great 
difficulties no matter how extensive is the documentation and 
evidence, including tape recordings, they have to back up their 
reports. Aside from stoically enduring "pain" of great 
magnitude, how courageous must these journalists be in order to 
use all the proof they have against their own top leaders in 
open court?

  [Excerpts] Senior General Than Shwe, chairman of the State 
Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] of the Union of 
Myanmar [Burma], left Yangon [Rangoon] by special aircraft at 
0730 today for the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] for a 
goodwill visit at the invitation of Lao President Nouhak 
Phoumsavan. Sr. Gen. Than Shwe was accompanied by his wife Daw 
Kyaing Kyaing. [passage omitted on party attending departure] 
Sr. Gen. Than Shwe also was accompanied by Lieutenant General 
Khin Nyunt, SLORC secretary-1, and his wife Dr. Khin Win Shwe; 
Lt. Gen. Myint Aung, minister of agriculture; Brigadier General 
Abel, minister of national planning and economic development; U 
Ohn Gyaw, minister of foreign affairs, and wife; Brig. Gen. Myo

goodwill and cooperation between the leaders and peoples of both 
countries. There have been reciprocal visits by leaders in 
recent years and more development has been achieved after 
exchanging views on agriculture, forests, construction, and 
recreational support activities. 
  In religion, bilateral relations are on the rise with 
exchange visits of sanghas and the presentation of donations. 
Since December 1990, Myanmar and Laos have cooperated on 
narcotics issues through national commission meetings. 
Bilateral cooperation is further enhanced by the signing of the 
narcotic suppression agreement with the People's Republic of 
China, LPDR, Myanmar, and Thailand in New York on 26 October 
1993. Moreover, Lao-Myanmar-Thai ministerial meetings were held 
in Thailand on 13-14 March 1992 and in Myanmar on 9-11 February 
1994. With the supervision of the joint border commission and 
beginning in 1990, survey work on the fixed Myanmar-Lao border 
demarcation in the Mekong River has been completed and the 
Myanmar delegation hopes that the agreement can be signed during 
this goodwill visit. During the visit, the Myanmar delegation 
will hold talks and exchange views at the head of state and 
ministerial levels benefiting regional stability and 
development. Myanmar, based on goodwill and cooperative spirit, 
has been able to donate rice, grains, salt, pumps, teak, seeds, 
and other commodities to Lao while Laos donated Kyat 20,000 to 
Myanmar for Irrawaddy flood relief fund on 5 September 1991.

<F P=106> [Editorial from the 9 June issue of PASASON: </F>
"Wholeheartedly Welcome the Chairman of the State Law and Order 
Restoration Council of the Union of Myanmar"] 
  [Text] Today, all Lao people and Vientiane residents are 
very pleased and greatly honored to welcome His Excellency 
[H.E.] General Than Shwe, chairman of the State Law and Order 
Restoration Council [SLORC] of the Union of Myanmar [Burma], and 
his delegation who are paying an official visit to the Lao 
People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] from 9 to 13 June at the 
invitation of H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan, president of the LPDR. 
  The official visit to the LPDR by H.E. the SLORC chairman 
and 
his party takes place after an exchange of a series of visits by 
the delegations at various levels from the two countries, for 
instance the friendship visit to the Union of Myanmar by H.E. 
Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon in late February 1992, which 
ended in glorious success, thus becoming an important step in 
the development and strengthening of the relations of friendship 
and cooperation between the two countries. Therefore, this 
visit -- the first foreign visit by H.E. Gen. Than Shwe in his 
capacity as SLORC chairman of the Union of Myanmar -- is 
regarded as a great honor for the LPDR. It is also an event of 
great significance in the history of the long-standing fine 
relations of friendship and good neighborliness between Laos and 
Myanmar. The visit will enable the peoples of the two countries 
to understand one another more profoundly, thereby contributing 
to further enhancing the relations of friendship and cooperation 
in various fields between the two countries; to more fruitfully 
benefitting the Lao and Myanmar peoples; and to building peace, 
stability, and cooperation for development in Southeast Asia and 
the world. 
  Laos and Myanmar have maintained fine and friendly relations 
over a long period of time. Our two peoples admire and respect 
one another and sincerely aspire to further strengthen our 
mutual cooperation and ties. In recent years, an exchange of 
visits by high-level delegations of the two countries has 
successively been conducted, acting as an important factor for 
gradually enhancing relations and cooperation in various fields. 
The peoples of Laos and Myanmar living along our common border 
regularly visit one another. Cross-border trade is also 
increasingly flourishing. The close brotherly relations have 
been distinctively displayed in the recent speedy demarcation of 
the common border between the two countries. An agreement will 
be signed on this during the visit. This important event will 
become an excellent model for all nations who are trying to 
solve historical border problems. 
  On this occasion, we, the Lao people, would like to express 
our sincere thanks to the people of Myanmar for rendering 
material and moral assistance to us in combating natural 
calamities in recent years. We wish the Myanmar people more 
glorious achievements and prosperity in developing and building 
their own country. We wish the SLORC chairman and his 
delegation brilliant success in paying this friendship visit to 
Laos, thereby contributing to making more fruitful the existing 
traditional fine relations of friendship and cooperation between 
Laos and Myanmar and bringing more practical benefits to the two 
peoples in the future.

  [Text] This morning at the Foreign Affairs Ministry in 
Vientiane capital, Souban Salitthilat, foreign affairs minister 
of Laos, and U Maung Maung Lay, ambassador extraordinary and 
plenipotentiary of the Union of Myanmar [Burma] to Laos, signed 
an agreement on a set of maps showing the demarcation of a 
common borderline between the two countries. The border maps 
signed today included 24 maps with the scale 1:10,000, showing 
the common border from the north to the south with the total 
length of 236 kilometers; and six border maps showing the 
overall border areas with the scale of 1:50,000. 
  Laos and Myanmar have cooperated with one another in 
conducting a survey to collect data and to draw maps since 1991. 
So far, the task has been completed. This achievement clearly 
shows the effective cooperation between the two sides, aimed at 
turning the common border between the two countries into one of 
genuine peace and friendship.

  [Text] Visiting Bruneian Foreign Minister Prince Mohamed 
Bolkiah willl hold talks with Prime Minister Chuan Likphai this 
morning at 1000 at the government house. The Bruneian foreign 
minister arrived in Bangkok yesterday for a three-day working 
visit as guest of Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri. Accompanied 
by his consort, Prince Mohamed Bolkiah will have an audience 
with his majesty the king this afternoon at Chitlada Villa. 
  Brunei is now Thailand's fourth largest trading partner in 
ASEAN. Trade balance between the two countries has been in 
Brunei's favor. Major Thai exports to Brunei are agricultural 
products while imports from that country mainly include oil and 
petroleum products. 
  Brunei is a major labor market for Thailand. About 21,000 
Thai workers have so far been employed in that country, and the 
number is on the rise because of growing demand for Thai labor. 
  Foreign Minister Prasong visited Brunei last year, and the 
ongoing visit by his Bruneian counterpart is a return visit as 
well as to strengthen relations between the two countries.

  [Text] Aranyaprathet -- Talks to reopen the border with 
Cambodia's Poipet township scheduled to begin yesterday have 
been postponed indefinitely, Col Ongkon Thongprasom, head of the 
Border Coordinating Office, said yesterday. 
  Col Ongkon said he had been informed by Banteay Meanchey 
Governol Gen Duong Khem of the request to postpone the talks 
because his side has not yet completed the relevant paper work. 
  The Khlong Luk-Poipet checkpoint has been closed since April 
9 following fighting between Cambodian government forces and 
Khmer Rouge guerrillas. In most cases, shells and gunfire 
strayed across the border threatening Thai traders. 
  Sa Kaeo Governor Kasem Chaiyasit yesterday met Thai traders 
to inform them of the postponement of the talks. He also told 
them of a plan to renovate Ban Rong Khlua market which was 
destroyed by fire on April 8. 
  The checkpoint closure has hit the border trade and doubled 
consumer prices to Cambodians in Battambang, Siem Reap and 
Banteay Meanchey provinces. 
  Informed sources said that most traders wanted the border 
reopened so that trade could resume as usual. Some influential 
traders however wanted it closed indefinitely in order that they 
could engage in smuggling. 
  Thailand last month told Cambodia it wanted the checkpoint 
to 
be permanent with both countries stationing immigration officers 
on a permanent basis. It also wanted Cambodia to guarantee 
safety and security in the region of the checkpoint and to agree 
to the setting up of a special committee against crime along the 
border.

<F P=106> [Article by Kunlachada and Marisa Chimprapha in Bangkok and </F>
Cristina Pastor in Manila: "The Quest for the United Southeast 
Asia"] 
  [Text] The idea of a united Southeast Asian community has 
long been a dream of ASEAN leaders. 
  But since the six-member bloc was founded in 1967 as a 
bulwark against communism, ideological differences have kept the 
region divided. The pro-Westem ASEAN six lined up on one side of 
the bamboo curtain and Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam on the other. 
Then there was also Burma, the region's odd man, doggedly 
following its own isolationist path. 
  The sweeping economic and political changes brought about by 
the end of the Cold War, however, have offered an opportunity to 
make the dream of a Southeast Asian Community a reality. 
  ASEAN has made cautious overtures to the four missing 
Southeast Asian states but the hide-bound membership process has 
added momentum to proposals for an alternative arrangement to 
help promote the development of a Southeast Asian community of 
peace and prosperity. 
  Academics and high-ranking government officials, who 
gathered 
at a meeting sponsored by the Philippines National Security 
Council last week, agreed that there should be a forum 
established to discuss the formation of European Union-styled 
community that would bind the ten nations together. The proposed 
forum would discuss joint approaches on political, economic, and 
social issues. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan said the forum, 
dubbed the "SEA-10", will be an alternative source of 
cooperation among countries in Southeast Asia. "It will be a 
place for all ten Southeast Asian nations to get together while 
waiting to become ASEAN members," said Surin who attended the 
seminar last week in a personal capacity. 
  Speaking to reporters after the conference, Philippine 
President Fidel Ramos mapped out a more ambitious vision, saying 
it could "approach the model of the European Union." 
  "This is open-ended. They are looking at 20 to 25 years 
which 
is the time for one generation and beyond. The major difference 
is the existing level underdevelopment among the countries 
involved," Ramos added. 
  Surin said officials from the six ASEAN states agreed to the 
establishment of such a forum while the remaining four Southeast 
Asian states have shown interest in the idea. 
  "The four countries are in a challenging zone within the 
world's brightest spot of economic development and we need to 
keep them on board in a certain way," Surin said. 
  The minister said there was also an over-riding need for the 
region to be able to take a unified position regarding external 
economic forces. "We need to take a defensive stance both in 
economic and security terms," Surin said. 
  Participants at the seminar in Manila felt that there should 
be an exclusive forum for the region to work out a pattern of 
relations among themselves and the outside world with a sense of 
common destiny. 
  Peter Ho, who attended the conference with the Singaporean 
delegation said, ASEAN "can no longer expect the United States 
to continue to underpin East Asian regional security". 
  "There will be difficulties with either Japan or China 
taking 
up the slack -- Japan because of the Pacific War and China 
because of the historical tributary relationship and the Chinese 
populations in Southeast Asia. Thus, our only recourse is to 
strengthen our own network of linkages," he said 
  Other ASEAN officials said they hoped the forum could become 
a model of international cooperation and a main actor on the 
global political and economic stage. 
  A joint declaration issued one week after the end of the 
meeting said that given the SEA-10's shared history, culture and 
close approximity, "Southeast Asia should be a community." 
  "A community of equal and sovereign states, each with its 
own 
identity and preferred interest, valued relationships and 
conceptions of development and progress but also with a sense of 
common destiny and shared perception of its own future and 
common commitment to the enhancement of regional peace and 
prosperity, fundamental human value and the basic principles 
enshrined in the Charter of United Nations." 
  "Wars and conflicts among the countries in the past show 
that 
countries in the region often failed the test of good 
neighborliness. 
  "We firmly believe that the time has come to articulate and 
pursue this vision of Southeast Asia, for the rapid and 
far-reaching changes which have been taking place since the end 
of the Cold War offer us a unique opportunity to shape our own 
destiny as the 21st century approaches," said the declaration 
titled "Southeast Asia Beyond the Year 2000, a Statement of 
Vision." 
  While stressing the SEA-10 will be a project of the future, 
Surin said some preparations towards building such a community 
are needed now. He said he hoped that the upcoming meeting of 
ASEAN Foreign Ministers will endorse the idea and that by the 
end of this year a meeting closer to policy making level could 
convene to start discussing the community's structure and 
programme activity. 
  The next step he said is to gel endorsement of the vision 
from ASEAN leaders who will meet for their Fifth Summit in 
Bangkok next year. 
  The delegates in Manila resolved that to achieve the vision, 
a number of flagship projects and measures must be adopted 
immediately. 
  Among these were an informal summit of Southeast Asian 
leaders as soon as possible. 
  The creation of dual-track approach for Cambodia--one to 
help 
consolidate the peace process and another to mobilize support 
and funds for social and economic development either though the 
setting up of a bank for the reconstruction of Cambodia and 
issuing of bonds. 
  Other plans included the organizing of a series of meetings 
at both senior official and ministerial levels to discuss and 
develop a mechanism to settle boundary disputes and other 
problems including piracy, the spread of contagious diseases, 
natural resource management and environmental conservation. 
  The endorsement of an ASEAN initiative concerning the South 
China Sea and the immediate undertaking of a project to build 
confidence among the states concerned. 
  The leaders' made commitments towards projects aimed at 
harnessing and equitably utilizing resources of Mekong river. 
  As things stand now, ASEAN governments have yet to formally 
adopt the issue although they have for the most part expressed 
support for it. 
  Out of fear that the forum might meet the same fate as 
Malaysia's East Asian Economic Caucus which failed to take off 
because of U.S. resistance to a closed economic bloc, the 
delegates stressed one of the imperative principles of this 
vision was that it should be an example of open regionalism. 
  "This means a recognition that while we wish to build a 
stronger and more cohesive community, there is also the need to 
be outward- looking, to look beyond Southeast Asia, and to 
continue to strengthen political, economic, and cultural ties 
with countries outside the region," the declaration stated. 
  It also cited the need for "unity in diversity" which means 
a 
recognition of not only the differences that divided the 
countries but also of the need and capacity for reconciling and 
transcending those differences through process of building trust 
and consensus.

  [Text] The Thai consulate general in Johannesburg will be 
upgraded into the Royal Thai Embassy in Victoria, the capital of 
South Africa. 
  The Cabinet this week approved the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs' proposal to upgrade the Thai diplomatic representation 
in South Africa in this fiscal year. The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs considers South Africa, after the non-racial elections, 
a prime site for the country's diplomatic offensive in Africa. 
  South Africa is a large country with a population of 40.6 
million and rich natural resources and huge economic potentials. 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs says Thailand can use South 
Africa as the base to further develop relations and cooperation 
with other African countries. The Thai Embassy in South Africa 
will also look after Thailand's interests in Sawaziland, 
Lesotho, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Angola, Zambia, 
Mozambique, Madagascar, and Mauritius.

  [Text] Parliament President Marut Bunnak's bid to defuse 
political tension yesterday foundered when his proposal to set 
up a 21-man "Committee for Democratic Reform" was rejected by 
hunger striker Chalat Worachat. 
  Immediately after Mr Marut's unsuccessful attempt, the 
democracy alliance announced it would call another major rally 
in front of Parliament on Wednesday to push lawmakers to endorse 
a Phalang Tham MPs' motion calling for a special House panel to 
redraft the Constitution as demanded by Mr Chalat. 
  The hunger striker rejected Mr Marut's proposal, saying it 
was not entirely related to his demand for the setting up of a 
House committee to draft a new constitution. 
  Claiming the Democrats' sudden about-turn on their previous 
plan to support a motion to form the House constitution 
redrafting committee was the cause of new tension, the 
Organisation of Political Reform [OPR] said: 
  "The Government must take responsibility for the problem and 
the crisis that may follow. The OPR hopes no untoward incidents 
will take place." 
  The democracy alliance, formed on June 2 at Thammasat 
University and comprising members from democracy groups, 
academics and elements of some coalition parties, met yesterday 
to discuss the latest developments. 
  Dr San Hatthirat, a prominent OPR member, claimed the 
planned 
rally was not aimed at applying pressure on the lawmakers and 
Parliament but stemmed more from the group's concern for Chalat. 
  The OPR has scheduled a major meeting at Thammasat 
University 
on Sunday to ask members for its support for the rally on 
Wednesday. All MPs will be invited to attend. 
  "We are confident a large number will turn up because we are 
concerned about Chalat's life," Dr San said. 
  The OPR urged Mr Marut put before the House a motion 
sponsored by 21 Phalang Tham members which was included on last 
Wednesday's House agenda for immediate deliberation. 
  The MPs submitted a motion calling for the formation of a 
special committee to redraft the constitution in defiance of the 
party's resolution after the Phalang Tham leadership joined the 
Democrats in reversing its previous stand to support the motion. 
  The OPR called for all Lower House members to support the 
MPs' motion. 
  Mr Chalat, who begins his 17th day of fasting today, said Mr 
Marut's proposal was irrelevant to his call for setting up of 
the extra House panel to pave way for a truly democratic charter. 
  It was high time the Democrats pushed for the setting up of 
the panel since it had all the power necessary to get such 
things done, he said. 
  The House Speaker and prime minister are Democrats. 
  Mr Marut visited Mr Chalat at the hunger striker's caged 
shelter outside Parliament and told him he had set up the 
Committee for Democratic Development which would include 
renowned physician Prawet Wasi, deans of political science and 
law faculties of Chulalongkon, Thammasat, Ramkhamhaeng and 
Sukhothai Thammathirat universities and representatives of all 
10 political parties. 
  Dr Prawet and Mr Chalat apparently shared the ideal of a 
more 
democratic rule and the nomination of the physician was expected 
to satisfy the hunger striker, according to the Speaker. 
  The committee, the chairman of which will be appointed by 
its 
members, has the duty to compile and study all aspects of the 
Constitution and to lay the groundwork for developing a 
monarchical democracy, according to Mr Marut. 
  Mr Chalat and Mr Marut exchanged views for about 15 minutes 
before Mr Marut crossed back to Parliament and said Mr Chalat 
needed a little more time to think. 
  Mr Marut said he had not consulted any Government leaders 
about his new committee. A House committee scrutinizing the 
charter would amend Article 211 to allow major changes by the 
new committee. 
  Mr Marut said the committee he had set up and that demanded 
by the hunger striker could be the same as Mr Chalat's call for 
a new, more democratic charter would be considered by his 
committee. 
  "Mr Chalat did not accept the committee (for Democratic 
Development) at the moment because he's such a resolute man who 
will not change his mind easily. He needs a little more time to 
think it over. If Mr Chalat consults other people about this new 
committee I've set up, he will change his mind." 
  Mr Marut said his committee would not only improve the 
content of the charter but also pave way for election of 
provincial governors and correct all various laws. 
  Mr Chalat said the Democrats' ideology was to create greater 
democracy. 
  "The Democrats have the ideals of opposing all kinds of 
dictatorship and of strengthening and developing democratic 
rule. This is the only chance for the Democrats to do it. Only 
the democrats have displayed this ideology and have fought 
dictatorships" 
  But he said he was feeling desperate about the Democrats and 
other politicians.

  [Text] Army Commander-in-Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit warned 
yesterday that criticism made against the military at a protest 
rally in front of Parliament would benefit no one but could lead 
to disharmony and violence. 
  "I don't see how criticism against the military would 
benefit 
the country or help strengthen national unity. Instead I think 
it could instigate violence," said Gen Wimon, apparently 
referring to social critic Sulak Siwarak who took a snipe at the 
military while addressing a rally in support of hunger striker 
Chalat Worachat last Sunday. 
  "Some groups might want to see that (violence) happen. But 
we 
in the Army do not want to see it happen to Thai people," said 
the Army chief. 
  Asked if he would take legal action against Mr Sulak, Gen 
Wimon said he believed the Thai public understood what was going 
on. 
  "Some people tend to attack everyone around them, believing 
no one is good except them themselves. However, there are not 
many of this kind of people," he said. 
  Gen Wimon then asked one reporter whether she had voted in 
the last general election. When the reporter answered with a 
nod, he said: "We have already exercised our political rights. 
Now it's time for us to let our representatives solve the 
country's problems through the parliamentary system." 
  The Army chief said he has never interfered with the 
country's administration. 
  In a democratic society, he said, one should learn to 
respect 
rules and regulations and try not to be too stubborn since "no 
one can do or get everything he wants". 
  "Like in a sport, we players have to observe its rule," said 
Gen Wimon who had earlier pledged full support for Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai against any move to force the Government 
to give in to Mr Chalat's demands. 
  Meanwhile, Navy Commander-in-Chief Adm Prachet Siridet said 
he was optimistic the current political situation would not 
become explosive if all sides tried to tackle problems with 
reason. 
  But he warned that a political confrontation might be 
inevitable if there was interference by outsiders who wanted to 
see the situation worsen. 
  "We want to see the problem (concerning Mr Chalat) resolved 
with understanding," said the admiral. 
  He added that Thai people should not repeat their past 
mistakes. "We have gained much experience and should find a good 
solution to the problem without repeating the same mistakes. " 
  Another top military officer, First Army Commander Lt-Gen 
Chettha Thanacharo, dismissed suggestions that Mr Chalat's 
demands had gained support from the public. 
  Lt-Gen Chettha said he was confident the majority of people 
still adhered to righteousness and democratic principles. 
  He warned that one should be cautious in dealing with the 
Constitution which was "most important to the lives of 59 
million Thais." 
  Lt-Gen Chettha, who is also a senator, said the Government 
had made the right decision not to set up a House committee to 
redraft the Constitution as demanded by Mr Chalat's supporters. 
  In an apparent show of sympathy for the Government, Lt-Gen 
Chettha asked: "What should we do if we are doing the right 
thing but other people see it as wrong?"

    [Editorial Report] The Bangkok vernacular dailies NAEO NA, 
SIAM RAT, and MATICHON publish on 9 June editorials commenting 
on the political situation and the handling of activist Chalat 
Worachat's hunger strike by the Democrat Party of Prime Minister 
Chuan Likphai. 
  NAEO NA's 400-word editorial on page 3 and headlined "The 
Democrat Party Must Be Responsible" points out that all hopes 
for improving the political atmosphere were ruined when Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai declared that his Democrat Party 
disagreed with the idea of forming any committees to redraft the 
Constitution. The abrupt change in the Democrat Party position 
has rapidly brought various pro-democracy groups together 
nationwide to voice their opposition to the Democrats and the 
coaltion government. The discontent can lead the country to a 
"chaotic and violent situation which can be ignited by either 
pro-democracy groups or other ill-intentioned and power-craving 
factions." 
  The editorial says: "We respect and admire the courage and 
sacrifice of Chalat Worachat, but we do not support his hunger 
strike, peaceful as it is. We also praise the government of 
Prime Minister Chuan Likphai for its strong adherence to correct 
principles in running the country. The Democrat Party's 
decision to reject the establishment of the committee to compile 
and reword the Constitution, however, is suicidal, excessively 
rigid, and unrealistic." 
  In conclusion, the editorial says: "While everything was 
about to be settled peacefully, the arrogant resolution adopted 
by the Democrat Party has worsened the situation. We, 
therefore, appeal to the Democrat Party to take full 
responsibility over whatever may happen from now on." 
  SIAM RAT's 300-word editorial on page 5 headlined "It's Time 
For Political Reform" says that the hunger strike has had both 
positive and negative repercussions. "The positive impact is 
that more people have come to realize that it's time to reform 
our democratic form of politics. Professor Prawet Wasi earlier 
offered this reform proposal, which he claimed would further 
improve the quality of life." 
  The editorial adds: "We agree with Professor Prawet Wasi's 
statement on his disagreement with the hunger strike and call 
for efforts to save Chalat's life through correcting or 
improving our political system even beyond what Chalat calls 
for. This is one way to solve the political crisis and maintain 
our cultural value that never lets anyone die without doing 
something to save him." 
  "The negative aspect of the issue is that if we simply stand 
idle and let Chalat die with the hope that nothing will happen, 
general feelings in society will certainly be affected." This 
is also against the traditional ethical values and heritage of 
the nation. 
  The editorial concludes by saying: "We hope that under the 
present circumstances, all political parties and politicians 
must act prudently and free themselves from old biases and 
principle in making judgements. If they cannot accept Chatlat's 
demands, they must come up with something superior, such as the 
proposal for political reform of Professor Prawet Wasi." 
  MATICHON's 400-word editorial on page 2 headlined: "The 
Democrat Party...Watch Out," notes that the Democrats, as the 
core of the coalition government, can do lots of things to 
tackle the problems in dealing with Chalat's hunger strike if it 
is not too hardheaded and pessimistic. 
  The editorial notes that the hunger striker has gained more 
and more supporters because his flexible demand was received 
aggressively by the government. "As a result of the 
government's aggressiveness and indifference in dealing with 
Chalat's demands, more and more democracy-loving people are 
supporting Chalat... The masses are agitated. All sorts of 
untoward incidents could happen." 
  The paper says: "The Democrat Party, up to this point, 
should 
realize that it has to compromise with the people's call for 
democracy and join the movement to bring about changes for 
improvement. The assumption that the other side intends to 
topple the government has placed the Democrat Party in the 
position of opposing the aspirations of the masses. The 
continuing obstinacy of the Democrat Party can jeopardize the 
prime minister's chair."

  [Text] Former Young Turk Leader Manun Rupkhachon has been 
officially reinstated in the military with the rank of 
major-general and will return as a staff officer attached to the 
Defence Minister, a Government House source disclosed yesterday. 
  The source said the Office of His Majesty's Principal 
Private 
Secretary has approved the Government's proposal for the 
reinstatement of Mr. Manun who was sacked after the now-defunct 
National Peace-keeping Council seized power from the Chatchai 
Chunhawan government in the February 23, 1991 coup . 
  Mr. Manun, then staff officer attached to Gen. Chatchai, who 
was also defence minister, was dismissed on June 12 of the same 
year for desertion after the former Young Turk leader 
disappeared. 
  "I feel delighted hearing the news and deeply appreciate the 
Government's push for the reinstatement," said Mr. Manun, adding 
that he was happy to finally get justice. 
  He said he has not yet been officially informed by the 
Government of the reinstatement. However, a number of his 
colleagues including Deputy Defence Minister Maj-Gen Sombat 
Rotphothong and ex-Phalang Tham Party leader Maj-Gen Chamlong 
Simuang had already congratulated him. 
  Mr. Manun, 57, said he would continue to serve in the 
military until his retirement in 1996.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Now, There Is No-Win Situation in the Country"] </F>
  [Text] Marut Bunnak, in a last-ditch effort to find a 
solution to the current political crisis threatening the 
country's fledgling democracy, used his powers yesterday as 
parliament president to unilaterally order the formation of an 
ad hoc House committee to draft a new constitution and initiate 
political reforms. 
  The 21-member committee, according to Marut, will be made up 
of prominent members of society including academics, military 
men and people from all walks of life as well as social critic 
Prawet Wasi and Chalat Worachat who is currently staging a 
fast-to-the-death on Parliament's doorstep. 
  The parliament president said if a good constitution was 
drafted, it may be proposed to the House for deliberation. In 
that event, MPs may ask the House to scrap Article 211 of the 
Constitution which, although it allows amendments to the 
charter, prohibits the drafting of a brand-new constitution. 
  Marut's intentions are indeed honourable, but as the saying 
goes: the road to hell is often paved with good intentions gone 
astray. And indeed we are now on that road. 
  When the parliament president informed Chalat yesterday of 
the formation of the new committee, the hunger striker 
outrightly rejected it and refused to end his fast. On 
Wednesday, close to 5,000 people rallied behind Chalat to demand 
a new constitution and speaker after speaker used the 
opportunity to lambast the Chuan government for its hardline 
stance against their demands. 
  The fact of the matter is that whatever draft constitution 
the ad hoc House committee comes up with, it will not be binding 
on any party and will be nothing more than just a draft. The 
harsh reality is that the current joint House-Senate 
Constitution Scrutinizing Committee, dominated by the 
opposition, will not under any circumstances bow to proposals to 
have Article 211 amended. 
  One of Chalat's core demands is that the Senate must be 
denied any role whatsoever in drafting the new constitution. 
  If Article 211 is to be voted upon by Parliament, at the 
suggestion of the joint house-senate committee, that would mean 
opposition MPs would have to cut their ties with the 
military-dominated Senate in their current joint alliance 
against the Chuan coalition and vote with government MPs. 
  In March both the opposition and the Senate joined hands to 
defeat the government-sponsored motions to make the Constitution 
more democratic. 
  When Phalang Tham hardliner Chaiwat Sinsuwong said on 
Wednesday night "devils are becoming angels and vice versa", he 
perhaps should have thought twice. Leopards will never change 
their spots no matter what. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai also cannot be absolved from 
blame for the current political mess. 
  Early on Tuesday, the premier agreed that the five parties 
in 
the government would hammer out details to form a committee to 
consider political reforms in the House. Though it wasn't what 
Chalat actually demanded, the hunger striker appeared receptive 
to the idea and indicated he would end his fast-to-the death 
ritual. That seemed to be an amicable end to the conundrum. 
  But within 24 hours, Chuan did an about-face and retracted 
his earlier statements saying a lone hunger striker could not be 
allowed to hold the government to ransom and certain 
"principles" had to be adhered to even if that meant dissolving 
the House and calling a general election. 
  It now seems the rot has set in for the collapse of Chuan's 
moribund government. An open revolt within the Phalang Tham 
Party [PTP], a main coalition partner, is threatening to break 
the party asunder. Nearly half of the PTP's 47 MPs have refused 
to withdraw a motion submitted to the House to form a committee 
to draft a new charter despite the Chuan coalition deciding 
against the motion. The rebel MPs from the PTP's "temple 
faction" are pressuring the party to break away from the 
coalition. 
  Clearly there now seems to be a no-win situation for either 
the Chuan coalition or the "Friends of Chalat" who are 
threatening another mass rally outside Parliament. 
  Dissolution of the House is inevitable. Let the ballot box 
decide everything. 
  A society which turns over the reins of government not by 
street demonstrations but by the vote, does not allow any 
political movement which is outside the electoral process to 
gain power. 
  We want political reforms and stability, but the way things 
are going now seems to indicate otherwise. The last thing the 
country needs is another bloodbath.

  [Text] The House of Representatives considered the 
copyright bill at 1345 today. Today's session was a 
continuation of two previous sessions held in the past two 
weeks. The bill contains 78 articles. 
  During today's session the debate by opposition MP's 
continued to attack the government's presentation of the bill to 
parliament. They said the bill does not benefit the Thai people. 
The motive for enactment of the copyright law is to exchange it 
for trade privileges from the United States. The debate by 
opposition MP's opposed protection for computer software, which 
is considered a type of literary work. Any duplication or use 
without consent by software copyright holders is punishable by 
law because it constitutes a violation of copyright. To protect 
copyright software amounts to hindering national progress 
because opportunities for students to study computers and 
programming will be limited despite the fact that computers are 
a technology and equipment for modernization. 
  Opposition MP's also asked the commission in charge of the 
copyright bill to withdraw the bill for review. They said they 
disagreed with the bill from the beginning, as evidenced by 
their rejection in the first reading and their refusal to join 
the commission in the second reading. They will boycott any 
deliberations at the next reading. They then walked out of the 
session at 1600. 
  Before concluding at 1655, the session voted to approve the 
copyright bill in the third reading so the bill will now be 
forwarded to the Senate for consideration.

  [Text] Friendship and cooperation between Vietnam and the 
Republic of Korea has developed quickly through official 
bilateral relations which was established in December 1992. The 
two countries have signed an agreement on investment 
encouragement, a trade agreement, an agreement on aviation, and 
set up an intergovernmental commission on economic, scientific, 
technical, and trade cooperation. 
  Economic ties have particularly developed rapidly. South 
Korea is granting official development aid of $50 million to 
Vietnam. Part of this sum is to be spent on the construction of 
a water plant in Thien Tan, Dong Nai Province, in service of 
daily life and industry in Bien Hoa industrial center. The rest 
will be spent on the construction of Highway No. 18 from 
Haiphong to Cai Lan Port in Quang Ninh Province. South Korea 
has granted an additional $10 million to help Vietnam carry out 
some more projects. 
  In 1993, two-way trade turnover between Vietnam and South 
Korea was $800 million, an increase of 60 percent compared with 
1992. It is estimated this year that the figure will increase 
by $1 billion. At present, South Korea has started two 
investment projects in Vietnam with a total investment capital 
of more than $500 million. South Korea ranks fifth among foreign 
investors in Vietnam. Major projects include oil and gas 
exploration and exploitation, and the construction of the Sai 
Dong Export Processing Zone in Hanoi. Many of these projects 
are well implemented, and others have great prospect for success. 
  Bilateral cooperation in science, technology, culture, 
sports, and health have also made good progress. In 1993, South 
Korea granted dozens of short-term scholarships, and helped 
train thousands of people in different sectors in Vietnam. In 
1994, under a labor agreement between the two countries, South 
Korea will receive 2,400 Vietnamese people as guest workers in 
South Korea for a third country. [sentence as heard] 
  During the South Korean foreign minister's visit to Vietnam 
in early May, the two countries signed an agreement on avoidance 
of double taxation. This was a significant event marking the 
development of bilateral relations, strengthening of economic 
and trade ties between Vietnam and South Korea, and meeting the 
interest of peace, stability, and cooperation in the region.

  [Text] Danish Day has been observed in Hanoi and Ho Chi 
Minh City. Together with the opening of the Danish Embassy in 
Hanoi and the Danish General Consulate in Ho Chi Minh City, the 
event opened up a new chapter in the Vietnam-Denmark relations. 
  The Danish minister of cooperation and development, Ms. 
Helen 
Degn, remarked that the tango has started. A high-level trade 
delegation led by the minister herself visited Vietnam. She 
bought with her a significant gift from Denmark: a long-term 
development cooperation program for Vietnam. Under this 
program, Denmark will give Vietnam a $100-million grant from 
1994 to 1997. The money will be invested in the expansion of 
Hoang Thach Cement Plant in its second stage, the upgrading of 
La Nga Sugar Mill, the upgrading of the water supply system for 
Dalat Town, research for the water supply system of Quang Ninh 
Province, and for the waste treatment plan in Ho Chi Minh City. 
Denmark also wiped $52 million off Vietnam's debt. 
  In 1992, the two-way trade turnover between the two 
countries 
was about $13 million. Last year the figure raised about $29 
million, and increase of 116 percent. At present, the two 
countries have signed an agreement on investment protection, and 
an agreement on avoidance of double taxation is under 
discussion. This will help promote trade and investment 
activities between the two countries. In the past years, Denmark 
was one of the European countries who had little economic 
relations with Vietnam. Evidently, the tide has changed. 
International observers state that Denmark was catching up with 
other countries in relations with Vietnam, and now the tango has 
started, it will continue.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA June 10 -- President Le Duc Anh yesterday 
submitted to the National Assembly at its current session a 
proposal for ratification of the United Nations Convention on 
Sea Law-1982 to which Vietnam is a signatory. 
  Vietnam has a long coastal line and large territorial waters 
and it has always attached importance to the sea issue. Over 
the past years Vietnam also directly took part in, and made 
certain contributions to, the building of the convention. 
  The UN Convention on Sea Law will serve as an international 
legal basis for the state and people of Vietnam to defend their 
sovereignty and territorial integrity at present and in future, 
thus contributing to promoting peace, stability, friendship, 
cooperation and development in the region and over the world as 
a whole. 
  On behalf of the government, Vice Prime Minister Tran Duc 
Luong also made recommendations to the National Assembly for 
ratifying the UN Convention on Sea Law. He also asked the N.A. 
to assign the N.A Standing Committee and the government to amend 
the national laws to suit to the stipulations of the convention, 
and allow the government to take appropriate measures to 
strengthen the defence and management of the territorial waters 
and continental shelf of Vietnam.

  [Text] Noumea, June 10 (AFP) -- An employers' union here 
launched a general business shutdown Friday to protest constant 
strike threats from workers' unions over employee rights. 
  About 90 percent of businesses in the territory closed early 
Friday in observance of the protest, said Alain Descombels, 
president of the French territory's Union of Small and Medium 
Enterprises. 
  Nearly 1,000 people gathered in the capital's center to 
denounce "a state of siege" mounted by labor unions, who "do not 
respect anything" and are demanding the resignation of High 
Commissioner Alain Christnacht. 
  Business and trade here have been disrupted over the past 
few 
months by labor strikes which have crippled port activities in 
Noumea. 
  On Thursday, striking longshoremen, who were until recently 
employed by the Chalandage transport and handling company, 
blocked oil automobile traffic in an area of the capital's 
center to protest the closure of the company and layoffs of its 
150 employees the same day, as well as the dismissal of their 
union leader, Roger Noraro. 
  However, the barriers were lifted Friday after the 
territorial government agreed to mediate a settlement between 
the workers and management. Talks were being held late Friday.

  [Text] New Zealand's prime minister, Jim Bolger, says he 
expects British warships to resume visits to his country's ports 
after a 10-year break. The visits stopped in 1984 after the 
then Labor Party Government in New Zealand banned nuclear armed 
and nuclear propelled vessels from entering its waters. 
  Speaking in London, Mr. Bolger said the British prime 
minister, John Major, had told him New Zealand's anti-nuclear 
policy had ceased to be an obstacle because British surface 
vessels no longer carry nuclear weapons. Mr. Bolger said it was 
likely a British warship would visit New Zealand this year or 
early next year. He said he hoped the United States would also 
reconsider its policy of not sending naval vessels to New 
Zealand.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- Chu Song-il, chairman 
of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade 
Unions of Korea (GFTUK) in his talks on June 3 proposed 
bilateral contact between the GFTUK and South Korean trade 
unions for the convocation of national conference. 
  Pointing to the negative stand taken by the South Korean 
authorities toward the North's proposal to convene a national 
conference, he said: 
  This is a challenge to the patriotic proposal of the North 
side which is bending all efforts for the convocation of a 
national conference and treacherous act openly ignoring the 
desire of all the fellow countrymen for an early opening of an 
epochal phase for the peace and peaceful reunification of the 
country. 
  Now the fellow countrymen of all walks of life in the North, 
South and overseas hoping for national reconciliation, unity and 
reunification are fully determined to bring the national 
conference to a success. 
  The workers in the North and South must take the van in the 
nationwide movement for the convocation of the national 
conference. 
  The workers in the North and South must meet and discuss 
with 
each other the great work of the nation with the national 
conference ahead and jointly pave the way for reunification. 
  Responding to this urgent demand, the GFTUK Central 
Committee 
proposes to the trade unions of South Korea to hold in a short 
time bilateral contact for discussing the question of the 
convocation of a national conference.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- The propaganda 
department of the Central Committee of the South Korean National 
Democratic Front (Hanminjon) on June 5 released "Article to the 
Entire People" throwing a revealing light on the environmental 
destruction in South Korea on "world day of environment," 
according to Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation. 
  The land, rivers and sea, the article says, have been 
polluted, leaving to the people no place where they can live 
without worries, due to the crimes of the South Korean puppets 
in reducing South Korea to a garbage dump of the imperialists 
and appendage to the Western pollution-causing industries. 
  Pointing out that South Korea has been reduced to a land of 
radioactive pollution owing to the puppet clique's development 
of nuclear weapons, the article says the danger of nuclear 
scourge is not a possibility of tomorrow but the reality today. 
  The article appeals to the South Korean people to turn out 
to 
expand the struggle for the dismantling of atomic reactors, the 
sources of disasters, introduced by the authorities for the 
criminal development of nuclear weapons, and against the 
building of nuclear waste dumps into an all-people movement to 
defend the land of people's life.

<F P=106> ["Folly of Puppet Precipitating Self-Destruction" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam called a "meeting of the National Security Council" on 
June 8 and let out a string of bellicose words over the "nuclear 
issue" of the North, crying that "a tough action for a solution 
through UN sanctions" must be taken now and "there is no other 
solution to the nuclear issue of the North but sanctions", 
according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  His outburst is a malicious challenge to the North and an 
anti-national criminal act that cannot be overlooked. 
  The Kim Yong-sam clique is crying for "sanctions" against 
the 
North more hysterically than outside forces. 
  The puppets are foolishly trying to increase the intensity 
of 
pressure and "sanctions" against the North by misleading 
unbiased public opinion with outcries over "challenge". But 
this is of no use and pressure and "sanctions" have no effect on 
us. Such method cannot lead to a solution to the issue but may 
drive the situation to a catastrophe. 
  It is a gross mistake, if they intend to attain their mucky 
political aim through "sanctions" against fellow countrymen, 
joining hands with outside forces, clean indifferent to the 
interests of the nation. 
  The Kim Yong-sam clique must clearly know that should they 
choose an adventure, pinning hope on the notion of "not by any 
possibility", it will bring the "civilian" regime to destruction.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- The North side 
headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and Students for 
the Country's Reunification (Pomchonghaknyon) released a 
statement Tuesday bitterly denouncing the traitor Kim Yong-sam's 
harsh suppression of the leading members of the South Korean 
Federation of General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon) and the 
South side headquarters of Pomchonghaknyon. 
  Branding the suppression as an unpardonable challenge to 
patriotism of South Korean students who are devotedly struggling 
for independence, democracy and reunification and to the 
indomitable will of the youth and students in the North, South 
and overseas for reunification, the statement said: 
  The Kim Yong-sam fascist clique are now making a sweeping 
roundup of 30 to 40 leading members of Hanchongnyon and the 
South side headquarters of Pomchonghaknyon including 
Hanchongnyon Chairman Kim Hyon-chun and Chairman of the National 
Reunification Committee of Hanchongnyon Yang Tong-hun. 
  The harsh suppression of patriotic students launched by the 
Kim Yong-sam clique of traitors around the second inaugural 
ceremony of Hanchongnyon is motivated by a sinister intention to 
stamp out the South Korean students' patriotic movement for 
reunification. 
  The traitorous clique must look squarely at the situation, 
promptly scrap "the National Security Law," [NSL] an 
anti-reunification law of the old time, and stop at once the 
criminal roundup of the leading members of the South side 
headquarters of Hanchongnyon and Pomchonghaknyon they have 
launched by invoking "the NSL."

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam fascist 
clique issued an emergency order to arrest some ten students 
including chairman of the South Korean Federation of General 
Student Councils (Hanchongnyon) Kim Hyon-chun and chairman of 
the Seoul District Federation of General Student Councils Yi 
Chong-u and then, on Tuesday, ordered the police throughout 
South Korea to quickly round up more than 90 hardcore leaders of 
Hanchongnyon, charging that the National Reunification Committee 
and the Policy Committee of Hanchongnyon have clear "tendencies 
of benefiting the enemy", according to a Seoul-based radio. 
  The suppressive offensive against Hanchongnyon is an 
anti-national criminal act to destroy the organisation which is 
playing the vanguard role in the struggle for independence, 
democracy and reunification in South Korea. It has whipped the 
students into fury.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- The No. 22 of June of 
the Russian paper PATRIOT carried an article on the career of 
Kim Yong- sam under the title "15 Years After" upon his Moscow 
trip. 
  The paper notes that Kim Yong-sam threw off his "election 
commitments" in less than one year after he took office as 
"president" and, while visiting the United States, signed a 
secret agreement with his masters across the ocean on opening 
the South Korean market to U.S. farm products. With this, Kim 
Yong-sam has actually brought sufferings to the 6 million South 
Korean peasants, says the paper, and continues: 
  Why? He sought to induce the United States not to agree to 
the package solution to the nuclear issue proposed by the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the talks with the DPRK 
and establish an "international cooperation system" against the 
DPRK. 
  Recalling that Kim Yong-sam had always made "tough 
anti-fascist speeches" while active in an opposition party for 
over 30 years, the paper says: When he became the leader of the 
New Democratic Party in 1974, he made an oath that he would 
devote his whole life to the struggle for genuine freedom and 
the restoration of democracy. 
  When he was ousted from the seats of opposition leader and 
"national assemblyman" in autumn of 1979, he cried: "Although 
the ruling quarters are trying to rob me of everything 
necessary, they cannot take away my political philosophy," the 
paper derides him, asking why can such a man who waxed so 
eloquent not be an opposition leader? 
  The paper quotes the title of an article of the South Korean 
magazine KIL "40 years of Perfidy and Betrayal of Kim Yong-sam 
Were Decades of Mad Acts To Become President." 
  It was not until the lapse of 15 years that the South Korean 
people understood whom Kim Yong-sam's political philosophy 
serves, it remarks.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- Yi In-mo, a former war 
correspondent of the Korean People's Army who returned to the 
socialist homeland on March 19 last year and is now widely known 
as the incarnation of faith and will, sent letters on June 7 to 
Kim In- so and Ham Se-hwan, unconverted long-term prisoners in 
South Korea. 
  In the letter to Kim In-so he says he feels aggrieved at the 
thought of Kim, a septuagenarian who has got a chronic disease 
during his nearly 34 years of prison life and is now working 
lonely with a colleague at a desolate quarry in South Korea 
without flesh and blood. 
  He writes that respected General Kim Chong-il shows deep 
concern for unconverted long-term prisoners like Kim In-so and 
is making every effort to fetch them to the North so that they 
may recover their health and live in happiness with their 
families for the rest of their life. 
  "The South Korean authorities say that you "have got 
citizenship", but this is a mere excuse for refusing to 
repatriate you," the letter says, and expresses the belief that 
he will daringly wage a struggle for his repatriation as fierce 
as his struggle for existence and thus bring earlier the day of 
reunion. 
  In the letter to Ham Se-hwan, Yi recalls that Ham was really 
concerned for him when he was in the South. 
  Noting that the DPRK is making every possible effort for an 
early repatriation of Ham Se-hwan, an ailing old man subjected 
to a hard life in an alien place, to his hometown where his 
sister and relatives live, the letter asks ham to fight for his 
repatriation to the North with confidence, for the day of their 
reunion in Pyongyang.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- The repatriation of Kim 
In-so and Ham Se-hwan and the release of An Hak-sop, unconverted 
long-term prisoners in South Korea, were demanded in different 
countries. 
  The Guinean Committee for Supporting Korea's Reunification 
in 
a statement on May 24 said that old men Kim In-so and Ham 
Se-hwan, who were taken prisoners during the Korean war, should 
have been sent back to the Northern half of Korea in accordance 
with the Korean Armistice Agreement, but they suffered pains in 
South Korean prison for 30 years and are now living a lonely 
life without the support of their families and relatives after 
their release. 
  The South Korean authorities must immediately send them back 
to the Northern half of the country where their families and 
relatives are waiting for them, stressed the statement. 
  The Portuguese Committee for Supporting the Independent and 
Peaceful Reunification of Korea in an appeal on May 23 demanded 
that old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan be repatriated to the 
Northern half of Korea at once and unconverted long-term 
prisoner An Hak-sop be set free. 
  The South Korean authorities claim that the fascist 
dictatorial regime has been replaced by a "civilian government", 
but the people are not ensured even elementary freedom, the 
appeal noted, and strongly demanded that the "National Security 
Law," a fascist law, be scrapped without delay. 
  The Mongolia-Korea Friendship Association in a letter to the 
International Committee of the Red Cross on May 21 called for 
helping old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan go back soon to their 
hometowns to enjoy human rights.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the 
International Committee of Jurists for Democracy and Human 
Rights in South Korea decided to form the international liaison 
committee for the release and repatriation to the North of the 
unconverted long-term prisoners in South Korea to build up 
broader world opinion on the tragic conditions of the 
unconverted long-term prisoners in South Korea. 
  The statement issued by the Secretariat on May 28 says the 
international liaison committee will urge the South Korean 
authorities to immediately send Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan to the 
North and release An Hak-sop, who are old unconverted long-term 
prisoners, and conduct worldwide activities for its realization. 
  The statement says: 
  "Old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan in South Korea were 
subjected to prison life for more than 30 years, but are denied 
repatriation to the northern half of the country for the reason 
that they refuse `ideological conversion,'" the statement says, 
adding: 
  "An Hak-sop has been kept in prison for over 40 years for 
his 
refusal of `ideological conversion' after he was taken prisoner 
as a soldier of the Korean People's Army in the Korean war. 
  "This is an undeniable violation of the Geneva Convention 
and 
a challenge to the resolutions of the International Committee of 
the Red Cross and the United Nations General Assembly."

KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- Japanese RENGO news 
agency recently reported "What is the Rumor of `Threat From 
North Korea' Aimed At," an article by Shigeo Hayashi, a 
researcher of peace and military affairs. 
  The article says: 
  Strange, indeed, are the reports of mass media about the 
"nuclear suspicion" against North Korea. It is clear that they 
are intentionally fabricating information and misleading public 
opinion for a dramatic switchover in the military policy of 
Japan. 
  They are spreading the rumor of "threat from North Korea" 
not 
only to promote the new U.S. strategy but to bring a turnabout 
in Japan' military policy and make people understand it. 
  While hastening military collusion with the United States, 
Japan seeks to establish a political and military system 
facilitating the use of armed force overseas. 
  This is why Japan is getting overheated in crying over 
"threat from North Korea" as she cried for "international 
contribution" at the time of the Gulf war.

<F P=106> ["Undisguised Nuclear Ambition" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Government 
recently decided to submit to the International Court of Justice 
a statement saying that "the use of nuclear weapons is not 
necessarily a violation of international law", according to a 
report from Tokyo. 
  This decision of the Japanese Government is a crude breach 
of 
the international law that prohibits the use of nuclear weapons. 
It is the biggest challenge to world peace and security and an 
unpardonable archcriminal act of bringing a nuclear holocaust to 
the globe. 
  This is an open manifestation of the Japanese reactionaries' 
criminal schemes to turn Japan into a nuclear power and thereby 
establish domination over Asia. 
  Now, the plausible mask of "three non-nuclear principles" 
much advertised by Japan hitherto has been thrown off, and it 
has become clear that its clamor about the DPRK's "suspected 
nuclear arms development" was to find an excuse for justifying 
its moves to become a nuclear power. 
  From the open talk of the Japanese Government that "the use 
of nuclear weapons is not necessarily a violation of 
international law", one can see clearly once again that the 
recently disclosed Japan's large plutonium concealment case was 
by no means accidental. 
  It is only too natural that the unbiased public opinion is 
now lifting up voices opposing and denouncing Japan's moves to 
become a nuclear power. 
  Japan must look squarely at the trend of the times and 
promptly give up the design for its conversion into a nuclear 
power, a move that would spell catastrophic consequences upon it.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- A Pyongyang meeting was 
held today upon the lapse of 68 years since the June 10 
anti-Japanese independence movement. 
  The movement in 1926 powerfully demonstrated worldwide the 
indomitable will and patriotic spirit of the Korean people not 
to allow the Japanese imperialists' occupation of Korea and 
colonial rule. It dealt a heavy blow at the colonial rule of 
the aggressors. 
  Yu Ho-chun, director of the Secretariat of the Central 
Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the 
Fatherland, said in his report: "Though half a century has 
passed since Korea was liberated from the Japanese imperialist 
colonial rule, the dignity and sovereignty of the nation is 
still ruthlessly trampled upon and the people are denied even 
the elementary democratic rights and vital rights in South Korea 
under the occupation of the U.S. forces." 
  Noting that the U.S. imperialists are intentionally 
rendering 
the situation of the Korean peninsula strained, threatening the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea by inventing "the 
suspicion of nuclear arms development by North Korea," the 
reporter said: 
  "The United Nations Security Council issued an unjustifiable 
`presidential statement' and is threatening `sanctions.' This 
clearly shows what brigandish method the U.S.-bossed imperialist 
allied forces are resorting to in an attempt to isolate and 
stifle the DPRK." 
  The reporter charged that the Japanese authorities, far from 
apologizing and compensating for the shocking crimes committed 
by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean people in the 
past, are trying to take economic sanctions against the DPRK and 
put military pressure on it. 
  "The Japanese authorities are accelerating their own nuclear 
arms development and nuclear armament, while raising a hue and 
cry over our `nuclear issue,' and worse still, perpetrating 
vicious acts against our Republic and the General Association of 
Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon)," he said. 
  He said that the United States must withdraw its troops of 
aggression and nuclear weapons from South Korea and immediately 
respond to the proposal of the DPRK for a new peace arrangement. 
And he demanded that the Japanese reactionaries refrain from 
joining the U.S. imperialists in their plot of a nuclear war 
against the Korean people, promptly stop suppression of 
Chongnyon, apologize for it and renounce their hostile policy 
against the DPRK. 
  The reporter called on all the Koreans in the North, South 
and overseas to rise up as one in the nationwide struggle to 
reunify the country through confederacy with the great unity of 
the whole nation under the banner of "10-Point Programme of the 
Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the 
Country", irrespective of ideology, religious belief, political 
grouping, class, stratum and property status, thus opening a new 
phase of national reunification this year.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
dedicates a commentary to the 68th anniversary of the June 10 
independence movement. 
  The commentary says: 
  The June 10 independence movement which was the biggest 
anti-Japanese patriotic struggle in Korea in the middle of the 
1920s dealt a heavy blow to the brutal colonial rule of the 
Japanese imperialists and powerfully demonstrated the 
indomitable will and stamina of the people not to tolerate the 
Japanese imperialists' aggression and occupation policy in Korea. 
  Much water has flown under the bridge since then. But 
national sovereignty has not yet been fully achieved nationwide. 
  The U.S. imperialists keeping South Korea under their 
military occupation have carried to an unprecedented extent 
their anti-DPRK campaign to stifle it, under the false pretext 
of "nuclear suspicion against the North," and the Japanese 
reactionaries are going to repeat the past history of crimes, 
openly crying for "legislative arrangements" to cope with "an 
event of contingency" on the Korean peninsula. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group, in a bid to stay on in power, is 
making no bones of converting South Korea into a test ground of 
the U.S. "new military strategy," a military intelligence base 
against the North and a market of surplus agricultural and 
livestock products and old and new weapons. 
  The United States must renounce its anachronistic policy of 
occupation, withdraw its troops and nuclear weapons from South 
Korea and come out with a sincere attitude to the DPRK-U.S. 
talks for a peaceful solution to the nuclear problem on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must give up the hostile policy 
toward the DPRK and the scheme to stage a comeback to Korea and 
the Kim Yong-sam group must discard the foolish dream of getting 
profits through gambling over the issue related to the destiny 
of the nation. 
  Peace and reunification are the unanimous demand and will of 
the whole nation. Nobody can break this will of our people.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- Social organizations of 
different countries recently sent letters to the Japanese prime 
minister in protest against the Japanese authorities' 
suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans in Japan. 
  The letter of the Zimbabwe-Korea Solidarity and Friendship 
Association said the Japanese authorities' search of Chongnyon 
organizations and murder of Japan-resident Koreans are part of 
Japan's hostile policy towards the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea and a very ill-boding move assuming political character. 
  It warned that if they continued to commit reckless acts, 
failing to lend an ear to the voices of the world peaceloving 
people, they will face a stern judgement by history. 
  The Lausanne Cultural Information Centre on the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea in Switzerland in its letter 
denounced the Japanese authorities for harshly suppressing 
Chongnyon organizations and Koreans in Japan and strongly 
demanded that they be ensured democratic national rights. 
  The chairman of the Bulgaria-Korea Friendship Association 
branded the suppression of Chongnyon by the Japanese authorities 
as a reckless and inhumanitarian act trampling down the 
democratic national rights of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan and 
a challenge to the DPRK.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- An international 
organization and organizations of different countries bitterly 
denounced the Japanese authorities' suppression of the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon). 
  The International Committee of Jurists for Democracy and 
Human Rights in South Korea in a statement on June 2 said their 
anti-Chongnyon campaign contradicts the universally accepted 
provisions on human rights and it is a wanton violation of the 
Vienna declaration Japan signed officially. 
  It called on all the democratic figures and human rights 
organizations across the world to launch vigorous activities 
urging the Japanese authorities to promptly stop the suppression 
of Chongnyon. 
  The Malian Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee in a statement 
June 1 said the suppression of Japan-resident Koreans by the 
Japanese authorities is an undisguised act of disturbing peace 
in the Northeast Asian region. It urged the Japanese prime 
minister to exercise his influence to promptly stop all acts 
which may cause distrust between the Japanese and Korean peoples. 
  The Nepali Intellectuals Forum sent a letter to the chairman 
of the National Public Safety Commission of Japan on June 3. 
  Noting that the suppression of Chongnyon by the Japanese 
police is obviously part of the hostile policy towards the DPRK, 
it demanded that the Japanese authorities stop the gross abuses 
of human rights at once and ensure human rights and safety of 
the Koreans in Japan.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The Japanese 
authorities' moves against the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan 
(Chongnyon) have come under fire in different countries. 
  Chairman of the National Liberation War Veterans Committee 
of 
Zimbabwe Charles Hongwe in a statement May 24 charged that the 
Japanese authorities were intensifying their crackdown on 
Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan as never before as part of their 
hostile policy towards Korea. 
  Emmanuel Haber, chairman of the Malta-Korea Friendship 
Association, in a protest letter to the Japanese chief 
executive May 22 said the suppression of the Koreans in Japan 
who should be granted special protection by the Japanese 
authorities is a violation of human rights that contravenes the 
principles of international law. 
  The chief of staff of the music school of the People's 
Forces 
for the Liberation of Mozambique in a statement May 25 said the 
Japanese authorities' crackdown on Chongnyon is aimed at 
tarnishing the dignity and image of the socialist Korea and 
attaining their dishonest political and military aims. He urged 
that the Japanese reactionaries should repent of their crimes 
and stop at once the anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon campaign.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- Kim 
Tae-hui, director of the International Affairs Department of the 
Central Standing Committee of the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), in a statement on June 7 
demanded that the Japanese authorities fully clarify their 
responsibility for the heavy losses caused to Chongnyon and 
Koreans in Japan by the unreasonable search of the Kyoto 
prefectural police and make an apology in explicit terms. 
  The search is an illegal and unjustifiable act, an incident 
beyond common sense, that will be regarded as a serious 
international problem, he said. 
  He demanded that the Japanese authorities immediately stop 
the suppression and violation of human rights which threaten the 
activities of Chongnyon and organisations under it and the life 
of the Koreans in Japan and take appropriate steps to prevent 
the recurrence of such incident.

<F P=106> ["Provokers Must Stop Acting Rashly" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- The Japanese police 
raided the Kyoto Prefectural headquarters of the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) on June 6 
on the false charge of violation of the "land act" and, at the 
same time, searched 27 places including houses of Chongnyon 
officials under the headquarters. 
  A NODONG SINMUN analyst today condemns such surprise raid 
and 
search of Japanese police against the Chongnyon organization and 
officials as an unjustifiable, illegal fascist outrage and an 
act of political suppression. 
  This is part of the hostile campaign for stifling the DPRK 
which the Japanese authorities have stepped up maliciously 
through collusion and tieup with the United States and the South 
Korean puppets, and a deliberate and premeditated criminal act 
to destroy the Chongnyon organization and block its patriotic 
activities, the news analyst says. 
  Recalling that the Japanese authorities have launched into a 
heinous anti-Chongnyon campaign whenever the anti-DPRK moves of 
the United States and the South Korean puppets got hysteric, he 
goes on: 
  The Japanese authorities have intensified crackdown on 
Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan, motivated by their hostile 
policy towards the DPRK, joining the United States and the South 
Korean puppets in their clamor about "nuclear suspicion against 
the North" and crying for "sanctions". 
  Nothing can justify the Japanese authorities' crackdown on 
Chongnyon, an authoritative and dignified organization of 
overseas citizens of the DPRK which enjoys unanimous support of 
the world people including broad sections of the Japanese. 
  We will surely call the Japanese authorities to account for 
their criminal acts in intensifying crackdown on Chongnyon by 
taking advantage of the United States and South Korean puppets' 
moves to stifle the DPRK. 
  Nobody can go scotfree after provoking Chongnyon, a 
dignified 
organization of overseas citizens of the DPRK, and Koreans in 
Japan. 
  The Japanese authorities must ponder over the consequences 
to 
be entailed by their anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon campaign and stop 
it at once and apologize for all the criminal acts they have 
committed hitherto.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today 
denounces the search of the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of 
the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) 
and houses of Chongnyon officials by the Kyoto prefectural 
police. 
  Noting that it, part of the hostile policy for stifling the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, was perpetrated by the 
Japanese reactionaries in a premeditated way to destroy 
Chongnyon and check its patriotic activities, the analyst says: 
  The search cannot be construed to have been done by the 
Kyoto 
prefectural police at its discretion or an accidental incident. 
It is a grave suppression for a sinister political purpose and 
a never-to-be-condoned illegal act. 
  The Japanese authorities must admit their mistake in the 
unjustifiable search of the Kyoto organization of Chongnyon, 
apologize for it and immediately return what they confiscated. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must act with discretion, clearly 
mindful that no matter how desperately they may try, they have 
nothing to get in their anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon campaign.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- The great leader 
President Kim Il-song today received Yang Kwidongnyo, daughter 
of anti-Japanese revolutionary martyr Yang Song-yong, and her 
companion on a visit to the homeland. 
  Present on the occasion were Kim Chong-im, vice-director of 
the party history institute of the C.C. [Central Committee], the 
Workers' Party of Korea, and officials concerned. 
  President Kim Il-song warmly received Yang Kwidongnyo, with 
whom he had departed at the Qinggouzi secret camp after the 
Nanhutou meeting in 1936, and had a cordial conversation with 
her, recollecting with deep emotion Yang Song-yong, an 
anti-Japanese revolutionary martyr who was a commanding officer 
of the Wangqing guerrilla unit, and other unforgettable

<F P=106> ["Propriety of DPRK's Reactor Core Refueling Method Asserted </F>
in U.S. and Japan" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- Voices asserting the 
propriety of the DPRK's method of reactor core refueling are 
ringing out from the United States and Japan at a time when the 
U.S. and the International Atomic Energy Agency have come to the 
wrong conclusion that nondivergence of nuclear material cannot 
be guaranteed, arguing that the technical possibility of later 
measurement of core fuel rods discharged from the 5 megawatt 
experimental atomic power plant of the DPRK is lost. 
  THE NEW YORK TIMES on June 4 wrote that as long as the spent 
fuel is kept in a special storage, it is possible to restore the 
records of how much plutonium North Korea extracted in 1989. 
  According to a recent issue of the U.S. weekly DEFENSE NEWS, 
John Wolfsthal, senior associate of the Nuclear Control 
Association in Washington, held that the method proposed by 
North Korea preserves the possibility of verifying later how 
long fuel rods stayed in the nuclear reactor and whether 
Pyongyang diverted fuel to the manufacture of nuclear weapons, 
or not. 
  He was quoted as saying the IAEA seems to have gone too far 
and concern is expressed that the agency is negatively viewing a 
possible solution of the issue. 
  Core refueling itself does not mean the impossibility of the 
recovery of historical information, he said. 
  NHK June 2 said the Japanese Government considers that the 
technical check-up of fuel rods is possible by the method 
proposed by North Korea.

<F P=106> ["U.S. Side Is Not Qualified To Talk About `Violation of </F>
Armistice Agreement', Spokesman of KPA Panmunjom Mission" -- 
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Panmunjom, June 10 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the 
Panmunjom mission of the Korean People's Army [KPA] in a 
statement today denounced the U.S. side for bringing forward on 
June 6 the question of holding a meeting of secretaries of the 
Military Armistice Commission (MAC) which had already ceased to 
exist and raising outcries over DPRK's "violation of the 
Armistice Agreement". 
  The step of setting up the KPA mission at Panmunjom was a 
realistic and timely one taken to tide over the present 
situation in which the Korean Armistice Agreement had been 
reduced to a mere sheet of paper and the MAC remained only in 
name due to the unreasonable behavior of the U.S. side, the 
spokesman said, adding the U.S. side knows this and has 
manifested its stand to make a contact with our members. 
  He went on: 
  The U.S. side, however, on June 6 abruptly came up with a 
proposal to hold a meeting of secretaries of the MAC which had 
ceased to exist. 
  In this regard our side called attention of the U.S. side to 
the fact that all the members of our side had been recalled and 
notified that an official of the KPA mission at Panmunjom might 
meet with the U.S. side. 
  Then, the U.S. side showed up at the conference hall and 
read 
a prearranged text and made a show of publishing a statement 
saying the act of our side was "a violation of the Armistice 
Agreement". 
  Such act of the U.S. side was nothing but a ridiculous drama 
aimed at evading its responsibility for having destroyed and 
obliterated systematically the Armistice Agreement and the 
armistice mechanism. 
  In fact, the U.S. side, at this late hour, is neither 
qualified nor has the face to talk about "violation of the 
Armistice Agreement". 
  It is the United States that expelled in June 1956 the 
neutral nations inspection teams which had been overseeing and 
controlling the introduction and carrying out of military 
equipment, staying at appropriate entry ports of South Korea 
according to Article 2 C of the Armistice Agreement. It is also 
the United States that unilaterally proclaimed in June 1957 that 
it would renounce the implementation of Subparagraph 13 D of the 
Armistice Agreement that stipulates the cessation of 
introduction into Korea of combat equipment. 
  It is the U.S. side that not only completely paralyzed the 
armistice mechanism by appointing a "general" of the South 
Korean Army who has neither legal justification nor 
qualification, as the "senior member" of its side but also is 
beefing up the Armed Forces in South Korea, taking issue with 
the fictitious "nuclear issue". 
  It is preposterous for the U.S. side that had unilaterally 
wrecked the major articles of the Armistice Agreement and the 
armistice mechanism to talk about an "agreement between the two 
sides". 
  What the military armistice commission and the neutral 
nations supervisory commission are needed for which have no role 
to play in preventing either arms buildup or the recurrence of 
war owing to the U.S. side query 
  Whether it accepts our new proposal or not is a touchstone 
for the fundamental question of war or peace. 
  The U.S. side is well advised to choose to establish a new 
peace arrangement whereby the danger of war can be prevented and 
peace and security definitely guaranteed, instead of trying to 
revive the armistice mechanism the function of which has been 
completely paralyzed by it. 
  We will watch the future act of the U.S. side.

the U.S. position toward North Korea's nuclear issue is to take

  This is a breach of faith against us who have made all

These are intolerable, criminal words and actions which are

<F P=106> ["United States Must Act With Discretion" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher in an interview with the NBC Television on 
June 7 openly declared that the U.S. stand toward the nuclear 
issue of North Korea is to take a tough action through 
sanctions, according to a report. 
  The United States is persistently crying for "sanctions", 
arguing that "the possibility of measurement is lost" as regards 
the reactor core refueling in the DPRK. The United States seeks 
in this a heinous political aim to bar the development of the 
existing nuclear power industry of the DPRK as a whole and, 
furthermore, stifle its socialist system. 
  This has been proved with added clarity by the fact that the 
United States is these days coming out with a totally 
unreasonable demand for "a special inspection" of two military 
sites of the DPRK under the pretext of "loss of the possibility 
of fuel rod measurement". 
  This demand reveals its intention to disarm the DPRK. 
  It is a wanton violation of the sovereignty of the DPRK and 
a 
graphic expression of the policy of stifling it to demand "a 
special inspection". This can never be allowed. 
  The current situation reminds us of that in March last year 
when we declared our withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty (NPT) against the "special inspection". 
  If the United States throw off the veil of the DPRK-U.S. 
talks and resort to the strong arm, crying for "sanctions" and 
"special inspection", our attitude cannot but change. 
  The United States must act with discretion, clearly seeing 
the firm will of our entire people and whole Army.

<F P=106> ["U.S. Fanatics Denounced for Pressure on DPRK " -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- The U.S. paper BALTIMORE 
SUN recently accused some forces in the United States of crying 
for "sanctions" against the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea over "nuclear suspicion." 
  In an editorial the paper said the pressure of nuclear 
non-proliferation has always been put on small nations by big 
powers possessed of nuclear weapons. 
  Noting that it is hard to understand why the United States 
is 
putting pressure only on North Korea, it charged that some 
forces in the United States, captivated by a sense of racial 
superiority, have created such a crisis. 
  Asking what is the reason to conclude that North Korea poses 
threat to mankind, the paper said it is because there are 
fanatics in the United States that the United States is kicking 
up a row only against North Korea, though some countries have 
developed or are developing nuclear weapons.

  [Text] According to a radio report from Seoul, the U.S. 
imperialist aggressive forces occupying South Korea conducted 
the so-called noncombatant evacuation operation exercise in 
Pusan on 6 June. They conducted the exercise on all U.S. 
soldiers and their family members who live in the U.S. bases 
throughout South Korea. It is said, therefore, that the exercise 
is aimed at checking their preparedness if they can rapidly 
evacuate from South Korea in the time of a so-called emergency 
situation. Furthermore, the noncombatant evacuation operation 
exercise is conducted under the pretext of our nonexistent 
nuclear issue at a time when the U.S. imperialists and the South 
Korean puppets lead the situation on the Korean peninsula to the 
brink of war. This fact has become another example of showing 
that their preparation for a northward invasion has been 
accelerated to a practical stage [silchondangye].

with his Maltese counterpart referred to the nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula, according to a XINHUA report June 7. 
  Qian said China adheres to the stand of maintaining the 
stability on the Korean peninsula and making it nuclear free, 
hoping that this issue will be settled through negotiations of 
all parties concerned. 
  It is not a good way to solve the problem by imposing 
sanctions. On the contrary, he said, this would make

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of 
the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] gave a reception Thursday on 
the occasion of the 63rd birthday of Raul Castro Ruz, second 
secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 
Cuba. 
  Addressing the reception, secretary of the C.C. [Central 
Committee], WPK Hwang Chang-yop spoke about the extraordinary 
contributions made to the victory of the Cuban revolution by 
Raul Castro Ruz with a staunch revolutionary principle, 
unfailing loyalty to the leader's cause, high organizing ability 
and fighting spirit in the revolutionary struggle, and about the 
great feats performed by him in building the party, state and 
Armed Forces after the victory in the revolution. 
  "Although they are separated by the oceans and continent, 
Korea and Cuba are as good as close neighbours for the deep 
intimacy established between the two state leaders, for the 
revolutionary principle to which they adhere, advancing under 
the banner of socialism, smashing the imperialists' challenges," 
Hwang Chang-yop said, and added: "We will make every effort in 
the future, too, to consolidate and develop further the 
comradely relations of friendship between the two parties and 
two peoples." 
  Cuban Ambassador to Korea Jose Ramon Rodriguez Varona said 
he 
extended warmest thanks to Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear leader 
of the Workers' Party and people of Korea, for arranging an 
excellent function to joyfully celebrate the 63rd birthday of 
respected Raul Castro. 
  Condemning the U.S. imperialists' reinforcement of 
destructive weapons in South Korea and dangerous war exercises, 
he said the Korean people's struggle is precisely a struggle of 
Cuba and that the Cuban people's support to the Korean people's 
cause of national reunification will always remain invariable.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- The Rimpac [Rim of the 
Pacific] military exercises of the United States, Japan, South 
Korea and other countries have come under fire in Burundi and 
Mozambique. 
  The Burundi-Korea Friendship Association said in a statement 
that it was an open secret that the U.S., Japan and South Korea 
have been building up their tripartite military alliance from 
long ago in an attempt to stifle the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea, but they revealed its true picture as they 
entered into a phase of real action this time. This is very 
dangerous and belligerent, added the statement. 
  Noting that the United States has started a reckless war 
game 
around the Korean peninsula by instigating its followers under 
the pretext of "nuclear suspicion" against the DPRK, thus 
rendering the regional situation further strained, the statement 
urged an immediate halt to it. 
  The Mozambican Committee for Friendship with the People of 
the DPRK in a statement said the United States is becoming all 
the more undisguised in its intention to take military action 
against Korea on any account through such a joint operation as 
Rimpac military exercise. 
  The statement strongly demanded that the United States 
ponder 
over what consequences would arise from its adventurous military 
action, stop it at once and accept the peace arrangement 
proposal of the DPRK. 
  If the United States take the road of a war of aggression, 
ignoring the desire of the Korean people and the world people 
for peace, it will face condemnations and destruction, it warned.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- Foreign state and party 
leaders supported the struggle of the Korean people for national 
reunification and solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Mozambican President Joaquim Alberto Chissano, when he met 
the Korean ambassador to his country on May 27, said the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula should be resolved through 
peaceful talks, not by means of pressure and war. 
  Hoping that Korea would be reunified at an early date 
according to the confederacy formula put forward by the great 
President Kim Il-song, he wished the Korean people greater 
success in their efforts for the reunification of the country. 
  Emile Kibala Bey a Nsien, national chairman of the Workers' 
Party of Zaire, when he met the Korean ambassador to Zaire on 
May 24, expressed positive support to the realistic and 
principled stand and proposals of the DPRK for a fair solution 
to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula and for its 
peaceful reunification. 
  Tridib Chouduri, general secretary of the Revolutionary 
Socialist Party of India, in a statement on May 25 strongly 
demanded that the United States stop its hostile policy and 
pressure campaign against Korea and honestly fulfill its 
obligation to guarantee a durable peace and security in the 
Korean peninsula through the DPRK-USA talks.

the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula in a peaceful way 
through DPRK-U.S. talks, and strongly urged the United States

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- Vessels are making a big 
contribution to the development of foreign trade in the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  Among them is a 15,000 ton cargo ship Hyoksin. 
  Twenty years have elapsed since the cargo ship Hyoksin set 
sail in 1974. 
  Since then it has come to anchor in ports of different 
countries in Asia, Europe, Africa and other regions. 
  It has carried essential goods to ports in 12 countries and 
regions including Vietnam, China, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, India 
and Indonesia in the period from late July 1993 to late March 
1994. 
  Thus, it has made more than 120 navigations across the ocean 
over the past 20 years, transporting several million tons of 
cargo to nearly 300 ports of more than 30 countries. 
  The ship has fulfilled its annual plan at more than 112 
percent, thus contributing to the development of foreign trade 
of the DPRK. 
  The captain of the ship became a labour hero. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il highly appreciated the 
success made by the ship in the past and sent thanks to its crew 
in October last year.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The plenary meeting of 
the Central Committee of the Korean Social Democratic Party held 
in Pyongyang on Thursday discussed the tasks of the party to 
carry into practice the proposal for the convocation of a 
national conference on the occasion of August 15, which was 
proposed at a joint meeting of the government, political parties 
and public organisations of the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea on April 11. 
  A report by Kim Pyong-sik, chairman of the Central Committee 
of the Korean Social Democratic Party, was followed by speeches. 
  The plenary meeting noted that the convocation of a national 
conference proposed by the joint meeting is a practical step to 
implement the ten-point programme of the great unity of the 
whole nation and that it is a patriotic and very timely measure 
reflecting the demand of the times and national desire to get 
through the difficulties created in Korea at present and open up 
a phase of turnabout for the peace and peaceful reunification of 
the country this year, a year before the 50th anniversary of 
national liberation. And it denounced the criminal act of the 
Kim Yong-sam clique in taking an unreasonable stand toward the 
proposal. 
  Stressing the conference must be convened on the occasion of 
the August 15, the plenary meeting said the Korean Social 
Democratic Party would in the future continue widely explaining 
and propagandizing the ten-point programme at home and abroad 
and make every possible effort to realise contact and dialogue 
with political parties, organisations and individual figures in 
South Korea and overseas and work hard to create domestic and 
international circumstances favourable for the convocation of 
the conference. 
  It called upon all the political parties, politicians and 
people of all walks of life in South Korea to actively turn out 
in the patriotic struggle for the convocation of a national 
conference which would pave a short cut to reunification by 
concerted efforts of the nation, transcending the differences in 
ideology, idea, political view and religious belief. 
  The plenary meeting adopted a relevant resolution.

achieved a steel-like singlehearted unity of the leader, the 
party and the people. 
  It is entirely thanks to the wise guidance of Comrade Kim 
Chong-il with iron will and grit that the Korean people have 
maintained independence even under the difficult and complicated 
circumstances where their country remains still divided and they 
are in direct confrontation with the U.S. imperialists. 
  Mozambican educational figure Salvador Miguel Fondo said: 
  The Korean people firmly believe in, hold in high esteem and 
follow Comrade Kim Chong-il as their eternal mental pillar, a 
symbol of happiness and future and a benefactor. 
  He has given all blessings to the Korean people. 
  He is the saviour of the Korean people. 
  The matchless grit, iron will and faith of Comrade Kim 
Chong-il are unparalleled and infinite. 
  Korea, led by Comrade Kim Chong-il, is always strong. 
  Chester Ndoro, administrator of the Supreme Court of 
Zimbabwe, noted: 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il has mastered the outstanding military 
idea, theories and war tactics of President Kim Il-song in his 
early years and has the virtues befitting an iron-willed 
brilliant commander. 
  The anti-socialist campaign of the imperialists is being 
intensified as never before, but the Korean people under the 
wise guidance of General Kim Chong-il are vigorously advancing. 
  The Bulgarian paper TRIBUNA said: 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il who is possessed of rare wisdom and 
iron 
faith has frustrated and destroyed the anti-socialist, anti-DPRK 
campaign of the imperialists and reactionaries by countering 
their counterrevolutionary offensive with revolutionary 
offensive, with his swift and bold strategy and tactics. 
  He firmly defended the dignity and sovereignty of the 
country 
and the nation by shattering to pieces the anti-DPRK moves of 
the international reactionaries with his clairvoyant wisdom and 
rare commanding art.

  [Text] Haeju Cement Plant workers, who are marking the 
significant day of the 30th anniversary of dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il's on-the-spot guidance, are accelerating production 
with great gratitude and joy. 
  In a meeting with reporter Yun Tong-kon of the Central 
Broadcasting Network, Comrade Cho Tok-yun, secretary of the 
elementary party committee, said: 
  [Begin recording] It has been 30 years since the dear 
comrade leader, who visited our Haeju Cement Plant with the 
great leader, gave his historic on-the-spot guidance. 
  I can still recall the gratitude of 28 May 1964, when the 
dear comrade leader visited our Haeju Cement Plant and checked 
the production capacity and operation status of the production 
equipment, and taught us about the position and importance of 
Haeju Cement Plant. 
  The dear comrade leader taught us that Haeju Cement Plant 
should repair and reinforce the production process in the future 
and apply active modern calcination methods. The dear comrade 
leader also said production was important, but it was more 
urgent to build housing units to improve the workers' living 
conditions. 
  Thanks to the wise leadership and warm care of the great 
leader and the dear comrade leader, our Haeju Cement Plant has 
steadily improved in a truly glorious manner for the past 30 
years. The development history of our plant was only possible 
due to the wise leadership of the dear comrade leader. 
  As in the past, the working class of our plant is resolved 
to 
share a significant role in carrying out our party's trade-first 
policy by taking only the leadership of the dear comrade leader 
as guidance and waging a struggle to implement his guidance with 
all wisdom and zeal. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["People Believe in General Kim Chong-il" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today in 
a political essay says the august name of the great General Kim 
Chong-il, a dear name which the Korean people always call with 
great pride and self-confidence, deeply reflects the 
unquestioned trust in and worship for the illustrious leader, 
the defender of their destiny who takes responsibility for their 
destiny and leads them to a brilliant victory with his matchless 
grit, iron will, broad magnanimity and warm human love, and 
their unshakable faith and death-defying resolve to fight it 
out, holding him in high esteem forever. 
  The political essay quotes great leader Comrade Kim Il-song 
as saying: 
  "Comrade Kim Chong-il is respected and loved by the people 
and enjoys high authority as a people's leader for his 
leadership ability and personality, loyalty, devotion and feats." 
  The essay reads in part: 
  The distinguished greatness and extraordinary leadership 
ability of our general as an illustrious leader taking 
responsibility for the destiny of the people and leading them 
lie in firmly defending socialism, their life and soul, from the 
imperialists and glorifying it. 
  The intelligence of respected General Kim Chong-il is a 
clairvoyant one of clearly seeing through what the enemy intends 
to do at all times and unfolding operations in a far-sighted 
way. It is a flexible stratagem of striking at weak points of 
the enemy with his mysterious and marvelous strategy and tactics 
according to the situation and circumstances and bringing 
victory on his own initiative. 
  His grit is a matchless grit of not wavering under whatever 
thunderstorm but countering any large Army, and an all-mighty 
strength of forging ahead in any storm and stress. 
  His spirit is one of certain victory, his magnanimity is an 
unfathomable one like the ocean into which all the rivers, big 
and small, empty, and his human love is a fiery one pulling at 
the heartstrings of the masses. 
  General Kim Chong-il and our people are an integrated whole 
sharing the same destiny, linked by one blood, one breath and 
one ideology. 
  Ours has become a people with a great purpose, strong faith 
and inexhaustible strength as they repose unquestioned trust in 
respected general Kim Chong-il and follow him. 
  Voices of the people vowing to become rifles and bombs and 
defend him with their lives constitute the acme of the immovable 
faith, the highest reach of the minds of the people who believe 
in and follow respected General Kim Chong-il, like a gem stone 
monument of the times erected high.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- A symposium of 
educational workers was held here Wednesday to mark the lapse of 
30 years since the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il began to 
work at the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. 
  Speeches were made at the symposium on the subjects "To Have 
the Dear Leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at the Head of Our Party Is 
a Historical Event Which Heralded a New Era of the Revolutionary 
Cause of Chuche," "Immortal Feats of the Dear Leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il in Achieving the Singlehearted Unity of the Leader, the 
Party and the Masses and Building the Strong Driving Force of 
Revolution", "Undying Exploits of the Dear Leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il in Opening a Great Heyday of Chuche-based Education by 
Wisely Leading Revolution in Education," etc. 
  The speakers said that the 30 years since the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il began his work at the party Central 
Committee were brilliant decades showing the glorious history of 
the illustrious leader who has led the whole party and people 
along the victorious road of the cause of socialism. 
  The great victory won by the dear leader in the course of 
accomplishing the socialist cause by defending the revolutionary 
traditions of chuche and strengthening the singlehearted unity 
of the leader, the party and the masses in every way constitutes 
his distinguished feat for the times and revolution, they said. 
  They recalled that he advanced a policy of making revolution 
in education in conformity with the requirements of the 
developing reality and ushered in a heyday of education. The 
imperishable feats performed by the party in the development of 
educational work, they said, are that it firmly armed all the 
students with the chuche idea and trained a large contingent of 
intellectuals capable of solving scientific and technological 
problems arising in socialist construction by their own efforts. 
  They said 1.73 million intellectuals have grown up and are 
reliably defending all posts of revolution and construction. 
  They stressed that all the achievements made in educational 
work are results of the energetic and wise leadership and 
solicitude of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il over the past 
30 years. 
  Choe Tae-pok, alternate Politburo member and secretary of 
the 
Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, was present at 
the symposium.

  [Excerpts] The Iranian Embassy here yesterday called on 
Thai authorities to be more vigilant against what it called 
"Zionist circles" that are trying to damage the prestige of 
Iran, as the court remanded for 12 more days three Iranians 
arrested last week in connection with the truck bomb plot in 
March. 
  The embassy, in a brief statement, said Iran "strongly 
rejects and condemns any act of terrorism against the life of 
innocent people and considers it unislamic and inhuman." 
  "Since Zionist circles are trying to damage the prestige of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran by creating false terrorist 
scenarios, we highly urge the Thai authorities to remain more 
vigilant on the events," it said. 
  It was the embassy's first public response to the arrests 
last week of three Iranians suspected to be responsible for the 
sabotage plot which police believed was intended against the 
Israeli Embassy in Bangkok. [passage omitted] 
  The three suspects were escorted to the Criminal Court, 
tightly guarded by heavily-armed police commandos, yesterday to 
be remanded for 12 more days as requested by investigators. 
  They were transferred to the Khlong Prem Central Prison for 
detention after the court approved a police request for the 
remand. 
  Investigators said they needed some more time to complete 
the 
questioning of 10 more witnesses and collect evidence to 
substantiate charges against the three in court. 
  They also asked the court to deny any bail request for the 
suspects, fearing they could flee. 
  Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Pol Maj Gen Sophon 
Warachanon said yesterday he expected the suspects to be charged 
in court in 10 days.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA June 9 -- Prime Minister [P.M.] Vo Van 
Kiet held talks with Acting Prime Minister Y. Zvyahilskyy right 
after he arrived in Ukraine yesterday. 
  P.M. Kiet and Acting P.M. Zvyahilskyy exchanged views on the 
orientation and measures aimed at developing the two countries' 
multi-faceted cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit. 
  P.M. Kiet affirmed Vietnam's persistent policy is to attach 
an importance to the consolidation and development of its 
multi-faceted cooperation with Ukraine. He said that the 
current visit of the Vietnamese Government delegation was a 
concrete manifestation of such policy. On behalf of the 
Vietnamese Government and people, P.M. Kiet thanked the 
Ukrainian people for their fruitful support and assistance to 
the Vietnamese people in their struggle for national defence and 
national reunification. 
  For his part, Mr. Zvyahilskyy highly valued the achievements 
recorded by the Vietnamese people in the process of renovation, 
especially in the economic field. He affirmed Ukraine's desire 
to rapidly push up its cooperation with Vietnam in the fields of 
ship building, energy, sea transportation, farm product 
processing and consumer goods production. 
  The two leaders stressed on the necessity to complete a 
cooperation mechanism, find out appropriate cooperation forms, 
and increase exchange visits of officials at ministerial and 
branch levels, and even between businessmen with a view to 
promote mutual trust and understanding. The two sides 
unanimously encouraged direct relations between economic 
branches and organizations of the two countries in undertaking 
different forms of investment and cooperation, and agreed on 
appropriate payment procedures. 
  In the evening, Acting Premier Y. Zvyahilskyy gave a banquet 
in honour of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and his entourage. 
  Speaking at the banquet, the two leaders praised the 
achievements recorded by the Ukrainian and Vietnamese peoples in 
their renovation process and reforms. They affirmed their 
countries' unchangeable policies to enhance their traditional 
friendship and multi-faceted cooperation for the interest of 
each country, and for peace, cooperation and development over 
the world. 
  Earlier in the afternoon, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and the 
Vietnamese delegation visited some economic establishments and

<F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>
  [Text] An Australian parliamentary delegation believes a 
settlement of the five-year old Bougainville secessionist 
conflict may be reached in a matter of months. The five 
parliamentarians visited Bougainville in April and also held 
discussions with the Papua New Guinea [PNG] Government and 
Defense Forces. 
  The report of the delegation's visit, which had been tabled 
today in Parliament, concludes that there can be no military 
solution to the conflict and recommends a timetable be set for a 
peaceful resolution. It also suggested the Australian military 
may have a role to play in rebuilding the island. 
  Labor senator Stephen Loosley, who as head of the delegation 
last week handed the copy of the report to the PNG Government, 
outlined its conclusions to Lyndal Curtis in Canberra. 
  [Begin recording] [Loosley] The peace process ought to work 
on the basis of the participants that are parties to the 
conflict talking directly within an agreed framework, with an 
agreed agenda with a person agreed by both sides as being 
suitable to chair the talks on the basis of a timeframe that is 
known to everyone, so that the focus is there and that people 
are conscious of their responsibilities. 
  We have been heartened by the responses that has come from 
both PNG and from the Bougainville interim government. 
  [Curtis] What about the concept of a South Pacific regional 
peacekeeping force raised by Sir Julian Chan? Is that a valid 
concept? 
  [Loosley] Yes, is very valid. The notion of neighboring 
South Pacific countries playing a role is one that the 
delegation recogizes would have very positive consequences. On 
that basis, there is a specific recommendation that ought to be 
an option. 
  Our view as a delegation was that Australia should work in 
concert with PNG to resolve the crisis. What we are saying is 
that a cease-fire having been implemented and effective border 
management having become the norm between Bougainville and the 
Solomons, then humanitarian assistance ought to be able to flow 
very freely across the island to the areas of greatest need. 
And in that respect, we have suggested that the island be 
opened up to a range of humanitarian organizations, 
nongovernment organizations, the churches to make certain that 
humanitarian assistance and support flows to areas of very real 
need. 
  [Curtis] Is the will there in the PNG cabinet for, say, a 
regional peacekeeping force or for a wider peace process to work. 
  [Loosley] My belief is very clearly that it is. Last week 
as a courtesy to the Government of Papua New Guinea, I took an 
advance copy of the report to Port Moresby for the foreign 
minister, Sir Julius Chan, and for Prime Minister Wingti, and 
the response was very positive in terms of people having had an 
opportunity to talk with me about our delegation's findings. 
And subsequent to that, of course, we have learned that there 
are ongoing discussions between the parties to the conflict 
which again is a very positive step, a major step forward. So, 
in terms of the resolve, I believe that within the Government of 
PNG the resolve exists. 
  [Curtis] Does Australia have a role to play in the peace 
process, or is the fact that the BRA [Bouganiville Revolutionary 
Army] sees Australia as far too close to the PNG militarily 
rules us out? 
  [Loosley] I think that is less true now than when it was a 
year or two ago. The delegation worked very hard at being as 
open- minded and evenhanded as we could, both in terms of the 
briefings that we undertook to have prior to our departure and 
the discussions that we had within PNG and subsequent to our 
return, and the letter that I have had from Mr. (Moses Seveni), 
who is the representative in Australia of the Bougainville 
interim government, has been very positive in terms of our 
delegation's visit. And my view is Australia therefore has a 
role to play in terms of supporting the peace process, in terms 
of logistical assistance, in terms of following through, once 
the peace process is hopefully proved successful, as I trust it 
will. And in that respect, we are talking very much in terms of 
rehabilitation and reconstruction. 
  [Curtis] Is there any role to play in the military [word 
indistinct]? 
  [Loosley] Our delegation is of the view that the Australian 
defense cooperation program could quite reasonably and 
realistically be extended to Bougainville in that type of effort 
-- road building, bridge building, the provision of 
infrastructure, health care, schools, things of that nature -- a 
very positive constribution at which our military have proved so 
able in terms of the defense cooperation program in West PNG and 
other parts of the country and of course, in other peacekeeping 
operations. 
  [Curtis] Could that potentially mean Australian troops on 
the ground in Bougainville helping in rebuilding effort? 
  [Loosley] I don't know that we would be looking to move in 
that direction quickly, if at all. I certainly think that there 
is a role for the defense cooperation program to be extended, 
though, in order to make sure that those skills are available to 
PNG to embark upon further rehabilitation and reconstruction. 
  There will have to be a clear peace settlement in place and 
security very clearly defined and guaranteed before it would be 
a circumstance where that kind of intitiative could be taken. 
  [Curtis] How about the question of human rights and claims 
of breaches of human rights during the conflict? 
  [Loosley] Yes, we endeavored to address that very directly. 
We have urged the Government of PNG to look at the Amnesty 
International report on human rights abuses by both sides as a 
benchmark. We have been heartened by the announcement by Prime 
Minister Wingti of Human Rights Commission for PNG and also of a 
police complaints unit to be located on Buka Island. So the 
response to date has been positive. 
  We are firmly of the view that there has to be a process of 
accountability. The delegation's view was that the rule of law 
must return to Bougainville in an evenhanded way and 
circumstances of human rights abuses be judged on the basis of 
evidence in a fair and reasonable way and those responsible be 
brought to justice and be made accountable. 
  [Curtis] In your view and the committee's view, is it 
reasonable to expect that the conflict on Bougainville will be 
finally resolved in a matter of months? 
  [Loosley] That would certainly be our hope. In terms of the 
time to make peace, I don't think there has been a better 
opportunity for negotiations and discussions and for peace 
settlement and reconciliation. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["IAEA Must Not Pursue Sinister Purpose" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- Hans Blix, 
director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA], in a report submitted to the United Nations Security 
Council on June 2 brought forward again "the necessity" of "a 
special inspection" of two military sites of the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea, alleging that the possibility of the 
measurement of fuel rods discharged from the 5 megawatt 
experimental atomic power plant in the DPRK was lost. 
  He also attempted to prove "the reasonableness" of his 
demand 
for "a special inspection" at the June meeting of the Board of 
Governors of the IAEA. 
  In this regard, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: 
  We, in keeping with our special status, honestly accepted 
the 
inspection for the continuity of safeguards and even allowed "an 
additional inspection" and replaced fuel rods in the presence of 
the agency's inspectors. The agency, however, is now urging us 
to allow "a special inspection" of two military sites. Lurking 
behind this are a mean intention and a grave political plot to 
have access to our military sites under the veil of inspection. 
  The analyst further says: 
  The feasibility of our method of preserving the technical 
possibility of the later measurement of fuel rods has already 
been proved on the theoretical and experimental basis. Then, 
why are some officials of the IAEA Secretariat arbitrarily 
making a political charge against us, persistently ignoring our 
method? 
  Do the "impartiality" and "democracy" loudly advertised by 
some officials of the IAEA Secretariat mean that the member 
nations should bow to the demand of the agency, with their 
sovereignty ruthlessly trampled down? While trying to 
politicize our "nuclear issue" and lead it to an inspection of 
military sites, they are openly joining the hostile forces in 
their moves to stifle our socialist system. 
  The IAEA Secretariat must no longer play into the hands of 
the privileged forces and seek a sinister political purpose but 
resume its original mission befitting an unbiased international 
organization.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the 
Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland 
[CPRF] in its Information No. 651 issued Thursday stressed the 
Kim Yong-sam group's suppression of the South Korean Federation 
of General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon) must be stopped 
immediately and the illegally arrested patriotic students be 
released at once. 
  Recalling that the Kim Yong-sam group has launched a roundup 
campaign against Hanchongnyon Chairman Kim Hyon-chun, former 
chairman of the organisation Kim Chae-yong, Chairman of the 
National Reunification Committee of Hanchongnyon Yang Tong-hun, 
former chairman of the committee Kim Pyong-sam and other 
hardcore members of the organisation, ruthlessly suppressing the 
righteous struggle of the students affiliated with the 
organisation, the information says: 
  Hanchongnyon is a vanguard organisation of progressive and 
patriotic students who are courageously fighting for national 
sovereignty and social democratisation and national 
reunification in South Korea which has been reduced to a U.S. 
colony. 
  All its activities are righteous deeds for the country and 
the nation, which can by no means be a target of fascist 
suppression. 
  The CPRF Secretariat bitterly condemns the South Korean 
fascist clique's suppression of Hanchongnyon as an unpardonable 
anti-national criminal act to destroy the organisation now 
active as a vanguard in the movement for independence, democracy 
and reunification in South Korea and thus bar the advance of 
pro-reunification democratic forces and prolong the remaining 
days of the pro-American flunkeyist traitorous "regime". 
  If the South Korean rulers persist in their reckless 
sword-brandishing against justice and patriotism, it will only 
precipitate their own destruction.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today says 
in a by-lined article on the 30th anniversary of the heroic June 
3 uprising of the South Korean people that the South Korean 
students and people will continue to fight vigorously till they 
have swept away the aggressors and traitors and established a 
true independent and democratic government by inheriting the 
fighting spirit of the participants in the uprising. 
  The June 3 uprising of South Korean students and people in 
1964 against the aggressive and treacherous "talks" between the 
Japanese reactionaries and puppets was a just anti-imperialist, 
anti-fascist democratic resistance to do away with the foreign 
forces and traitors and restore the national dignity and 
sovereignty. 
  Thirty years have passed since the uprising, but the desire 
of the South Korean people to live in an independent society 
free from foreign domination and interference has not yet been 
realized. 
  South Korea still remains a U.S. colony and military base 
and its people fall victim to it. 
  Because of the flunkeyist treacherous acts of the Kim 
Yong-sam group the U.S. political, economic and military 
domination over South Korea is intensifying and the people's 
sovereignty is violated ruthlessly. 
  Having brought the North-South dialogue to a total freeze at 
the instigation of the United States, the Kim Yong-sam group 
committed without hesitation such never-to-be-condoned crimes 
as unilaterally nullifying the "joint declaration on the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" which was adopted and 
effectuated by the North and the South and announcing its 
renouncement. 
  The reality shows that independence and democratization of 
the South Korean society and national reunification can neither 
be achieved, nor can the nation avoid suffering a nuclear 
holocaust if such flunkeyist traitors and war fanatics as the 
Kim Yong-sam group are left intact.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- A meeting was held on 
the spot Tuesday on the lapse of 47 years since the great leader 
President Kim Il-song went to the Mirim plain on the suburbs of 
Pyongyang and transplanted the first rice seedlings. 
  President Kim Il-song enforced the agrarian reform as the 
first step of the democratic reforms after Korea was liberated 
from the colonial rule of Japanese imperialism to gratify the 
age-old desire of the farmers for the land and went to the Mirim 
plain on June 7, 1947, and transplanted rice seedlings with 
farmers. 
  That day he said he was transplanting rice seedlings for the 
first time after his return to the homeland and gave 
instructious to raise per unit harvest by effective seed rice 
breeding, turn more dry fields into paddy fields by expanding 
the irrigation works, and make the people's life affluent at an 
early date by developing stockbreeding. 
  It was noted at the meeting that there is no leader like our 
leader in the history of any country who stepped into a paddy 
field and transplanted rice seedlings with farmers and shared a 
simple lunch with them. This significant day will be cherished 
for ever in the hearts of our people, the reporter said.

  [Text] On 8 June, a top official of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] explained a view that in 
an attempt to end negotiations in priority areas prior to the 
Japan-U.S. comprehensive economic talks, it is likely that 
ministers, including Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and MITI 
Minister Eijiro Hata, will visit the United States and hold 
ministerial meetings with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor and other secretaries. 
  Regarding goals of the negotiations, the same senior 
official 
said that "details of a report, which will be submitted to the 
Hata-Clinton talks, will be worked out in deputy ministerial 
talks before the [Naples] summit." In this way, he explained 
the idea of producing some results before the summit in the four 
priority areas -- government procurement, auto and auto parts, 
insurance, and export promotion and competitive power.

  [Text] Jeffrey Garten, U.S. undersecretary of commerce for 
international trade, who is currently visiting Japan to 
participate in the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, granted an 
interview to SANKEI SHIMBUN on 8 June. He indicated that he 
plans to urge Japanese trade officials during future 
negotiations to promptly implement deregulation measures, 
saying: "The administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton gives 
solid support to deregulation efforts which have been undertaken 
by the administrations of both former Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and incumbent Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. We hope 
that concrete progress can be made in one way or another within 
the next few months." 
  Regarding the outlook on the resumed framework trade talks, 
Garten said: "We expect tough negotiations. At the moment, I 
cannot say whether the United States and Japan can reach a 
satisfactory agreement." Thus, the U.S. official made reference 
to the issue of deregulation, while indicating a cautious stance 
on the prospects of the trade talks. 
  Garten also pointed out the problem of the gap in prices of 
commodities in Japan and abroad, saying: "Prices in Japan are 80 
percent higher than the average prices in other OECD member 
nations. This is because there is a problem with the 
distribution system in Japan." 
  Garten then said: "Deregulation is very important. It will 
enable Japanese consumers to buy foreign products at lower 
prices. It will also encourage personal spending, thereby 
helping boost the Japanese economy all the more."

  [Text] The research participants council [RPC] (chaired by 
Kyoto University Professor Zentaro Kitagawa) of the Agency for 
Cultural Affairs [ACA] has been studying whether "reverse 
engineering (RE)" -- which means companies analyzing and 
extracting ideas from software developed by other companies to 
utilize such data for the development of their own software -- 
should be included as one of the rights protected by the 
Copyright Act. In its report published on 30 May, the RPC 
explained that "we have not come up with concrete proposals on 
the revision of the act so far." Although the RPC has been 
studying the possibility of conditional approval of RE, it 
shelved the decision to revise the law because the U.S. 
Government showed "grave concern." Domestic manufacturers, such 
as Fujitsu Ltd. and Toshiba Corporation, are opposed to 
postponement of the decision because they have been urging for 
the approval of RE because "RE is indispensable for the 
development of compatible products." 
  The RPC, a private advisory body to the ACA director 
general, 
has been studying the propriety of the use of RE in computer 
software development since last July. RE generally means 
analyzing the structure of software developed by other companies 
and extracting technical or design ideas to utilize them for 
development of one's own software. To produce duplicates of 
other companies' products through RE is against the law. 
However, there is no regulation about extraction of ideas in 
the Copyright Act. 
  Fujitsu and other domestic manufacturers say "RE is 
indispensable in developing products marketable worldwide." The 
RPC has been collecting various views mainly in favor of 
permitting RE because this is already quite commonly used as a 
measure to develop products. 
  However, IBM, Microsoft, and Apple Computer Inc. voiced 
opposition at a hearing for U.S. companies concerned late last 
year. Likewise, the Office of the United States Trade 
Representative (USTR) and the Department of Commerce showed 
"grave concern." Thus, there has been a delay in the RPC's work 
schedule. 
  Four basic views, ranging from all-out support to all-out 
opposition, as well as their reasons, are all included in the 
RPC report. The council decided to postpone revision of the 
law, explaining: "Further discussion on the Copyright Act is 
required. It will be appropriate to wait for court rulings on 
legal interpretation for the time being, and resume the 
discussion in line with the development of the situation." 
Thus, the council has winded up its discussion. 
  The RPC also discussed the following: 1) The legal status of 
the duplication of computer programs for private use in the 
Copyright Act, and 2) what actions should be taken against the 
production and sales of devices for bypassing the 
copy-protection function, which enable easy duplication of 
programs. 
  With regard to duplication for private use, the RPC affirmed 
the need for regulations, and decided to start preparations to 
impose rules. However, since this is an issue common to other 
digital products, such as multimedia software, the council has 
merely decided to "hear the opinions of the parties concerned, 
and urgently discuss this issue on another occasion." 
  Concerning the production and sales of copy-protection 
bypass 
devices, most council members said legal regulation is 
necessary. However, the council did not reach a clear-cut 
conclusion, saying "hearings should be held for parties 
concerned."

  [Text] The Ministry of Finance [MOF] will partially 
liberalize fire and non-life insurance premium rates, which are 
currently uniform among insurance companies, as early as 1996. 
The measure, a response to the U.S. demand in the Japan-U.S. 
framework talks, will be implemented as part of such insurance 
system reforms as allowing life and non-life insurance companies 
to participate in each other's business through their 
subsidiaries. The idea is to begin with the insurance policies 
geared toward large corporations, then gradually and flexibly 
broaden the scope of liberalization so that insurance companies 
can accommodate the change. The aim is to reduce premium rates 
through competition among the insurance companies, thus 
lessening the burden on policy holders. 
  Under the current system, such major non-life insurance 
policies as those for fire, casualty, and automobile insurance 
are exempt from the application of the Antimonopoly Law. 
Premium rates for those policies types are about the same 
throughout the industry. Moreover, the non-life insurance 
industry's Insurance Premium Rate Calculation Team calculates 
rates on the basis of the current conditions of premiums paid by 
companies and the administrative costs involved, then submits 
them to the MOF for approval. 
  The new system will enable insurance companies to set their 
premiums independently according to their own expenses within a 
certain limit -- for example, 20 to 30 percent -- above or below 
the premium rates put forth by the Calculation Team. Companies 
wishing to exceed the limit in either direction will be allowed 
to do so after submitting to the MOF the basis for calculating 
their premium rates and gaining the ministry's approval. Even 
in that case, however, given the need to secure the financial 
resources for insurance payments, the maximum discount rate is 
not expected to exceed 40 percent. 
  If the setting of insurance premium rates is liberalized, 
insurance companies are expected to set substantially higher 
premium rates and exact more demanding conditions for high-risk 
subscribers. Therefore, the scope of liberalization is foreseen 
as being limited at first only to such corporate insurance 
policies as fire insurance for factories, then expanded in 
stages to other types of policies. But in the case of automobile 
liability insurance, which is compulsory, liberalization is 
likely to be deferred in order to avoid the situation of 
insurance companies being unable to pay sufficient insurance 
money to accident victims.

  The Japanese side also explained: "We discussed our analysis 
of the present situation in North Korea." 
  Details of the talks are unavailable, but the Japanese and

  [Text] At a House of Representatives' Budget Committee 
meeting on 8 June, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata commented on the 
DPRK's suspected development of nuclear weapons. He said: "The 
situation will become serious if nuclear arms development should 
progress. In some cases, sanctions will be necessary to deal 
with such a situation. In a conflict of power, I think 
(imposing sanctions) is effective under certain circumstances." 
In this way, the prime minister stressed the effectiveness of 
sanctions by the UN Security Council.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 10 June Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] On 9 June, a top Foreign Ministry official showed a 
prudent stance toward a Russian proposal for an early 
international conference among the United States, Russia, China, 
Japan, the ROK, and the DPRK (North Korea), on North Korea's 
alleged nuclear weapons development. He said: "I believe 
neither the United States nor the ROK fully supports the idea 
right now." 
  However, the official noted the idea may become worthy of 
consideration when the UN Security Council [UNSC] adopts a 
resolution on the issue, saying: "It appears some nations would 
support an international conference following the UNSC 
resolution."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article; part two of series entitled </F>
"Bureaucrats and the Coalition Government": "Argument Over 
Possible Action Against North Korea Intensifies"] 
  [Text] "Could you please spare me a few minutes? I have 
something to tell you." At the beginning of April, a senior 
Foreign Ministry official dropped in on Tomiichi Murayama, 
chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], at his 
office, which is located in the members' office building. The 
Foreign Ministry official left shortly after briefing Chairman 
Murayama on the growing crisis over the DPRK's alleged nuclear 
weapons development program. 
<H5>  The Bitter Experience of the Gulf War Is Ever-Present in the </H5>
Minds of the Bureaucrats 
  Two weeks later, during the process of hammering out a 
policy 
platform for the new coalition government, the SDPJ and the 
Shinseito-Komeito [Japan Renewal Party-Clean Government Party] 
bloc were strongly divided over the question of how far Japan 
would be able to cooperate should the United States decide to 
impose sanctions on North Korea ahead of a UN resolution. 
  Takeo Nishioka, who was waiting for the outcome of the 
negotiations inside the Diet building, explained the sentiments 
of Shinseito coleader Ichiro Ozawa and of his allies as follows: 
"The fact that Japan was unable to take prompt action during the 
Gulf war remains in everyone's heart. If possible, 
crisis-management legislation should be drafted," he said. (At 
that time, Nishioka was the leader of Kaikaku No Kai, a group of 
former members of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] who are 
closely aligned with Shinseito.) 
  "Although we made every effort to explain the situation, the 
SDPJ did not understand at all," the senior Foreign Ministry 
official said disappointedly. "There is a great possibility 
that Japan might be forced to take some action against North 
Korea in the near future. When the time comes, we do not want 
to see politicians disputing basic points," he added. 
  In May 1991, shortly after the end of the Gulf war, a U.S. 
delegation led by Assistant Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz 
came to Japan to hold discussions with senior Japanese Defense 
Agency officials and with LDP members. When [Foreign Minister] 
Koji Kakizawa, who at that time was chief of the LDP's National 
Defense Division, explained to the U.S. side that "Japan will 
continue to contribute to activities based on UN resolutions," a 
senior U.S defense official said with a glum look, "Does this 
mean that Japan will only be able to repeat what it did during 
the Gulf war should hostilities break out on the Korean 
peninsula?" Senior Defense Agency officials, who attended the 
meeting, took these words seriously. 
  Since the end of March 1994, each political party has been 
holding a series of informal meetings to study the DPRK issue. 
Foreign Ministry and Defense Agency officials, who are unable to 
forget the bitter experience of the Gulf war, volunteered to 
join these meetings as lecturers. 
<H5>  Bureaucrats Are Making Steady Progress in Their "Study of </H5>
the North Korean Issue" 
  On March 30, the day before the UN Security Council issued a 
statement urging North Korea to accept full-scale international 
inspections of its nuclear sites, the LDP held a joint meeting 
on issues related to Northeast Asia. At the meeting, Shunji 
Yanai, director general of the Foreign Ministry's General 
Foreign Policy Bureau, stressed that the government's basic 
stand is "to seek a resolution of the crisis concerning the 
DPRK's suspected nuclear program through dialogue." However, 
at the same time he added, "By employing different scenarios, 
the ministries and agencies concerned are checking on what Japan 
can or cannot do within the existing legal framework." 
  According to high-ranking government officials, the 
ministries and agencies concerned are not examining possible 
measures with the object of "preparing for an emergency arising 
from trouble on the Korean peninsula" but rather they are just 
doing this as part of their "study of the North Korean issue." 
They have been making steady progress in compiling possible 
measures that might be taken against the DPRK -- restrictions on 
bilateral trade through a government ordinance on trade 
controls, and a regulation from the Finance Ministry restricting 
the flow of funds from Korean residents in Japan to North Korea. 
The possibility of assisting a U.S. naval blockade is also 
being examined. Some documents compiled by the Defense Agency 
even refer to Japan's participation in the U.S. Theater Missile 
Defense plan as "an option having a psychological effect on 
North Korea," although there is controversy over this subject, 
which includes the problem of collective self-defense. 
  Meanwhile, shortly after assuming his post in the Hata 
administration, Foreign Minister Kakizawa said that Japan needs 
a public debate on reinterpreting the Constitution regarding the 
notion of collective self-defense. 
  Although the DPRK's intentions are still unclear and 
although 
the UN Security Council has not yet decided on a response, the 
belief that Japan will take action against North Korea is 
growing because of the support for this by both bureaucrats and 
politicians. 
  Officials at the prime minister's official residence in 
charge of the DPRK issue feel apprehensive about such a 
situation. "Seen from a diplomatic viewpoint, it is undesirable 
to hold such discussions in this way, because our neighboring 
countries may make various conjectures about this. The study of 
possible actions should be pursued quietly," they said. 
  "Japan's cooperation on sanctions is very important. 
However, if Japan reinterprets the Constitution for that 
purpose, the new interpretation will remain valid even after the 
North Korean issue is settled. So, we have mixed feelings," the 
first secretary at the South Korea Embassy said when he was 
asked about the fact that there is a belief within the Japanese 
Government that Japan should participate in an economic 
blockade, even by reinterpreting the Constitution. "All the 
words that Japan has been using to apologize for its actions 
during the war were a mere pretense. Japan is expressing regret 
just because it wants to become a permanent member of the UN 
Security Council. I was swayed by such misgivings when I heard 
the remarks of ex-Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano regarding the 
1937 Rape of Nanjing," the secretary added. 
<H5>  Bureaucrats Have the Question of Permanent Membership on the </H5>
UN Security Council on their Minds 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata clearly expressed his intention 
to seek a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. "If you 
want to push for a permanent seat, this is the time to start 
lobbying," Yoshio Hata, Japan's former ambassador to the United 
Nations, stressed when he called on Prime Minister Hata at the 
beginning of May. Meanwhile, Sakigake [Harbinger], which 
strongly favors minimal involvement by Japan in global affairs, 
opted out of the ruling coalition. As a result, bureaucrats 
have become more aggressive over diplomatic and security issues.

  [Text] On 8 June, Ashikaga Bank disclosed the amount of 
trade exchange between Japan and North Korea and remittances by 
ethnic Koreans in Japan to their relatives in the DPRK, which 
the bank handled in fiscal 1993. According to the bank, the 
total of remittances to the DPRK were less than 500 million yen 
that year. Meanwhile, the amount of trade exchange, including 
receipts and payments, was approximately $47 million (about 
4,880 million yen), which accounts for about 10 percent of the 
total trade volume between the two countries (in fiscal 1993, 
according to customs statistics). This is the first time that a 
Japanese financial institution has disclosed the amount of 
remittances to the DPRK it handled. 
  The disclosed amount includes remittances in dollar terms 
Ashikaga Bank handled at a request of other Japanese banks. 
Commenting on the amount of remittances and trade exchange it 
handled, the bank said: "You cannot say the amount is larger 
than handled by other Japanese banks."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Have a Debate on the Rights and Wrongs of </F>
Becoming a Permanent Member"] 
  [Text] There is a theme which we would like Prime Minister 
Hata and Foreign Minister Kakizawa to explain concretely at a 
resumed session of the Diet without fail. It is the theme of why 
Japan must become a permanent member of the UN Security Council 
[UNSC]. At his talks with French and German leaders, the prime 
minister expressed Japan's strong desire to become a permanent 
member and said that "Japan will fulfill its responsibilities 
(in the United Nations)." His utterances are an extension of 
"Our Country's Opinion on the Equitable Distribution and 
Expansion of Security Council Seats," a document worked out by 
the Foreign Ministry. 
  At its General Assembly meeting last year, the United 
Nations 
inaugurated a work team to deal with the "Security Council 
reorganization issue." The work team is scheduled to finalize a 
report around June and July and then present it to the 49th UN 
General Assembly this fall. The work team appears to be desiring 
to draw a conclusion on this issue in next year when the United 
Nations greets the 50th anniversary of its founding. 
  Whether Japan has to decide to join the rank of permanent 
members or not is a question to be discussed fully among the 
people. It is not the kind of question on which a government 
office is allowed to work out "our country's opinion" 
arbitrarily to show it externally. 
  Becoming a permanent member is not a goal, but merely a 
means 
for Japan. What matters is to what Japan will say yes and to 
what Japan will say no. In other words, the important thing is 
what functions the United Nations should carry out for the 
security of the world. If the United Nations does not intend to 
assume the shape that Japan wants it to, Japan should decline to 
become a permanent member no matter how eagerly it is asked to 
do so. 
  It is said that with the end of the cold war, the United 
Nations has revived as a dispute-settling organization. There 
are now as many as 17 PKO [peacekeeping operations] conducted by 
the United Nations. 
  However, the United Nations is not omnipotent. While Prime 
Minister Hata was visiting Europe, the U.S. Government announced 
a policy through which to decrease U.S. participation in the PKO 
and to limit the PKO to cases directly connected with national 
interests. The United States became disgusted with the deaths 
and injuries caused to its soldiers in Somalia. The activity in 
Somalia was clearly a failure because the United Nations ceased 
to be a mediator in the dispute and became a disputing party. 
  Yet the United Nations is not totally powerless either. A 
democratic election was carried out successfully in Cambodia 
under the guidance of UNTAC (UN Transitional Authority in 
Cambodia), and the minds of the people there are stabilized 
compared with one year ago. 
  Moreover, As a result of a failure in Somalia, there is a 
growing view that the United Nations should put emphasis on the 
prevention of disputes and on political solutions. This view is 
based on the notion that permanent members should not only 
discuss the appropriateness of military actions, but also study 
what is called overall security, which combines economic and 
technical assistance, humanitarian aid, election management, and 
cease-fire supervision. 
  What do we expect from the United Nations? Some think that 
we 
should become a permanent member and be willing to take military 
actions for collective security while some others view that we 
should carry through our position of not intervening in any 
disputes at all. No consensus has been established among the 
people. In addition, no full understanding seems to have been 
developed among them as for the meaning of joining in the 
Security Council as well. 
  We are not objecting to becoming a permanent member itself 
from the beginning; however, we feel it dangerous that, in the 
course of time, a grave issue determining Japan's external role 
has been turning into a kind of established policy before we 
become aware.

  [Text] At the 13th meeting at the prime minister's 
official residence on 8 June, members of the "Defense Policy 
Council," an advisory panel to the prime minister, agreed to 
"review the significance" of the Japan-U.S. security pact. The 
security agreement was the main pillar of Japan's security 
policy in the Cold War era. However, considering changes 
following the end of the Cold War era, the panel has decided to 
review the significance of the security pact. 
  The panel plans to discuss specifics at future meetings. At 
present, there is a strong opinion within the panel that "the 
pact should not be defined as mere the framework of Japan-U.S. 
security arrangements, but it should be characterized as a 
nucleus of a security system in the Asia-Pacific region." 
  Besides conventional cooperation such as assuming burdens 
for 
maintaining the U.S. forces in Japan, the panel is expected to 
discuss giving more support to the U.S. forces stationed in the 
region. Concluding an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement 
(ACSA), which allows Japan and the U.S. forces to mutually 
provide goods such as fuel, is also a topic to be discussed by 
the panel.

  [Text] At the House of Representatives' Budget Committee 
meeting in the morning of 8 June, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa 
touched on possible enactment of emergency laws in the event the 
UN Security Council decides to impose sanctions against North 
Korea over the issue of nuclear arms development and said: "It 
will depend on contents of sanctions. We have to decide at that 
time whether we need to enact emergency laws." In this way, he 
explained his understanding that emergency laws will be needed 
depending on the contents of the Security Council's sanctions. 
  Regarding a possible case of preventing, as part of the 
sanctions, people from sending money from Japan to North Korea, 
Takatoshi Koto, director of the Ministry of Finance's [MOF] 
International Finance Bureau, said: "We treated cases in the 
past in line with the contents of the [UN] resolutions by 
issuing MOF notifications on the basis of the Foreign Exchange 
Control Order." In this way, he suggested that the MOF will deal 
with the issue of remitting money to North Korea by issuing its 
notifications. They made these remarks in response to questions 
asked by Shozo Kusakawa (of Komeito) and Hidenao Nakagawa (of 
the Liberal Democratic Party).

  [Text] On 21 and 22 May, YOMIURI SHIMBUN conducted a 
nationwide public opinion poll on people's view on the 
Self-Defense Forces [SDF] which will mark the 40th anniversary 
of its establishment in July. Fifty-three percent of the 
respondents have a good impression of the SDF. The rating 
exceeded 50 percent for the first time since the first public 
opinion poll on this issue was conducted in 1984. 
  Asked about whether the SDF is constitutional, 53 percent 
answered it is "constitutional," 22 percent, it is "not," and 25 
percent "refrained from answering." Concerning the necessity 
of the SDF, 84 percent said it is "necessary," representing an 
overwhelming lead over the 10 percent of respondents who said it 
is "not." On the question of in which areas the SDF has been 
"useful," 74 percent answered ensuring national security, 95 
percent, disaster relief; 92 percent, cooperation in people's 
livelihood. Such a high percentage of favorable views 
illustrates the fact that the SDF has taken root among the 
people. Regarding SDF's future participation in UN peacekeeping 
operations (PKO), over 70 percent also said it is "necessary." 
  This is the fourth time the impression of the SDF has been 
surveyed, following polls conducted in 1984, 1988, and 1991. 
The rate of respondents having "favorable impression" or 
"rather" favorable impression reached over 30 percent in 1991, 
and had shown a slightly rising tendency. However, the 
percentage in the most recent poll increased by 13 points, 
compared to the result of the previous poll. It is believed 
that the SDF's activities in Cambodia, where the SDF 
participated in a PKO mission for the first time, improved its 
image. On the other hand, 14 percent, the lowest figure ever, 
said they have a "bad" impression. 
  With regard to the SDF's future participation in PKO, 23 
percent said it is "not necessary" or "not really necessary," 
while 71 percent -- more than three times those respondents 
answering in the negative -- said participation is "necessary" 
or "probably necessary." These results show that most people 
think it is natural for the SDF to participate in UN-led 
international contribution programs. However, regarding the 
question of unfreezing its participation in UN peacekeeping 
forces (PKF) acting as buffer forces and in other missions, 
which is a focal point in revising the PKO Cooperation Law, 
nearly one-half of the respondents answered, "the ban should 
remain as it is for the next several years." Thus, most 
respondents expressed a cautious view.

  [Text] The traditional government stance that "the use of 
nuclear arms is not necessarily a violation of international 
law" has been deleted from an official statement the government 
plans to submit to the International Court of Justice [ICJ]. 
What happened in the process has once again served to show that 
the ruling coalition government is "controlled by the 
bureaucracy," something for which the coalition government has 
been under fire ever since the inauguration of the 
administration of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa last 
year. For Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, this could be considered 
a political blunder which may possibly give the impression that 
he lacks leadership in an area that has to do with Japan's basic 
stance in foreign affairs. 
  At a news conference following a lower house budget 
committee 
meeting on 8 June, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai told 
reporters: "(After the Foreign Ministry drew up the official 
statement), it was referred to ruling coalition parties so as to 
lay the groundwork for its approval. However, word about this 
spread and turned into a controversy." He thus hinted that top 
government officials, including Prime Minister Hata and Foreign 
Minister Koji Kakizawa, failed to review the statement 
sufficiently. 
  Even amidst rising objection in the nation to the 
government's stance on the issue, the Foreign Ministry continued 
to doggedly maintain its stance, saying "there is no change in 
the government's legal view of the issue" (as stated by Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Terasuke Terada). In the past, the 
government has made it known that this was its stance not only 
at Diet sessions, but also whenever it had the chance to discuss 
nuclear arms issues during informal talks with allied nations 
and with members of international organizations. 
  However, to indicate the government's stance to the ICJ via 
an official document would add considerable weight to the 
significance of this "stance." Moreover, as the issue of the 
DPRK's (North Korea's) suspected development of nuclear arms has 
become a serious international concern, it could have been 
predicted well in advance that making public such a government 
stance in the form of bureaucrats' explanation to the ruling 
coalition parties would create a controversy not among 
politicians, but also among the people. There are many ruling 
coalition party officials who shake their heads in amazement. 
  When Prime Minister Hata first glanced through the 
statement, 
he reportedly felt that "it was hard to understand." However, 
the Foreign Ministry explained that "this stance has been 
repeatedly disclosed in the past," and the prime minister 
accepted the explanation without further question. This is what 
has complicated the matters. 
  This situation of letting bureaucrats take care of 
government 
affairs became evident again at a meeting of the lower house 
Committee on Foreign Affairs on 8 June. Foreign Minister 
Kakizawa was unable to make a clear answer to a question by 
Tadatoshi Akiba, a member of the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan, who asked: "Does this mean that if North Korea uses 
nuclear weapons, you cannot say that this is a violation of 
international law?" 
  Even though some cabinet ministers voiced objection to the 
government stance on the issue of the legality of the use of 
nuclear arms, a decision was made to delete the clause regarding 
this stance only after deliberations at the lower house Budget 
Committee meeting came to a halt over this matter. All this has 
led to doubts about Prime Minister Hata's and other ministers' 
leadership. Moreover, such action cannot help but give the 
impression that the Hata administration has merely tried to ride 
out the situation for the time being, since the government 
maintains that it will not change its legal view of the issue.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Refuting `Japan Nuclear Armament Argument'"] </F>
  [Text] The "Japan nuclear armament argument" is creating a 
clamor. The clamor is coming mostly from the United States. The 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (North Korea's) 
suspected nuclear development is being discussed in relation to 
Japan's nuclear development also. 
  In a recent issue of the U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS magazine, Lee 
Kuan Yew, senior minister of Singapore, stated that "if Japan 
decided on nuclear armament, it would be impossible to overturn 
their decision. The United States cannot even stop North Korea's 
action." 
  The end of last January, a British newspaper reported with 
heavy headlines the possibility of Japan developing nuclear 
weapons, as coming from a secret document of the British Defense 
Ministry. The report was highly questionable. However, the U.S. 
reacted immediately. Defense Secretary Perry testified in the 
Congress that "if Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan judged that 
North Korea was armed with nuclear weapons, it would be possible 
that they each would move to possess nuclear weapons." Senator 
Nunn, chairman of the Senate's military committee, also stated 
that "Japan possesses the ability and technology (to develop 
nuclear weapons), as well as plutonium." These statements 
accidentally proved what the United States is fearing the most, 
that is... North Korea's possession of nuclear bomb, East Asia 
becoming unstable, Japan's nuclear development becoming 
justified, Japan's becoming a militaristic giant. 
  Why is Japan's nuclear armament so often discussed in the 
United States? One reason is because of the strategic necessity 
of the U.S. hardliners (hawks), so that they may justify the 
U.S. militaristic presence in Asia, with the excuse to keep an 
eye on Japan. The other reason is because the Japanese 
Government has not given a counterargument against it. 
  There are four possible stages in nuclear armament. Stage 1 
is to possess several atomic bombs. Stage 2 is to possess 
several hundred tactical nuclear bombs. Stage 3 is to be 
equipped with strategic nuclear weapons in addition to the first 
two. Stage 4 is to possess a nuclear strategy system equivalent 
to what the United States has. 
  First, we will discuss stage 1. There remains a technical 
problem. However, suppose the problem were cleared. Where would 
we perform a test? Consider India's example. Although they did 
the test in the middle of a dessert, they were troubled with the 
residue of plutonium for a long time after that. It would not be 
possible to test domestically. 
  Moreover, the international political reaction would be 
great. The United States would stop exporting uranium fuel and 
technology to Japan, and they would also demand the already 
exported uranium back. Japan would be forced to cut down energy 
demand (consumption), and the Japanese economy would result in 
great confusion. Trade restrictions by the United States and 
neighboring countries would be inevitable. However, just 
possessing several atomic bombs would not do much for defense of 
Japan, unless Japan were prepared to commit suicide. 
  Stage 2 could be reached within 10 years, if unrealistic 
conditions, such as that Japan can borrow a place for testing 
from another country, and that uranium can be obtained 
abundantly, are met. However, this plan is fragile in terms of 
security, and would be the worst choice. Stage 3 may be achieved 
in 10 to 20 years, if public opinion concerning constitutional 
reform is unified, and if the people are prepared for a life of 
endurance. However, by then the military technology possessed by 
some countries, such as the United States, would be more 
advanced, and Japanese nuclear strategy would be out of date. 
Stage 4 is out of the question. 
  Japan has influence in its own way, by sticking to being a 
non-nuclear power nation, while being a potential nuclear power 
nation. However, once it performs a nuclear test, Japan would 
become nothing more than the smallest and the weakest country 
among the nuclear powers. 
  Japanese people fully recognize that showing leadership in 
nuclear disarmament as a nation, which has suffered from atomic 
bombing, is the very purpose of Japan. Our government should let 
the world know more aggressively that Japan's nuclear armament 
is out of the bounds of possibility realistically as well as 
ideally.

  [Text] In the late hours of 9 June, a top official of the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] commented on the possibility of 
his party dropping its plan to submit a no-confidence motion 
against the administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. He 
said: "That possibility cannot be ruled out." 
  A top official of the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
recently announced that it would not align itself with the LDP 
regarding an LDP-proposed no-confidence motion. The top LDP 
official was hinting at the possibility the LDP may scrap its 
plan to submit the no- confidence motion in light of such 
circumstances.

<F P=106> [Article by editorial staff writer Yasuhiro Tase: "The </F>
`Nagano Statement' Was Expected--Nagano Appointed To Prepare for 
Establishment of a `National Emergency Law'"] 
  [Text] In viewing the press interviews of the assumption of 
office by the minister of justice, I was given the impression 
that Mr. Shigeto Nagano clearly differs from other cabinet 
members. The reason was that his sincerity could be sensed from 
his facial expressions and he gave the impression that he was 
expressing his own ideas in his own words. 
  I was surprised when he said, "I have had my own personal 
thoughts on legislation concerning national emergencies." I 
immediately felt that he would soon be fired for making a 
problem statement. 
  In viewing his television press conference concerning 
retraction of his statement, he was making the statement as if 
he were doing so with great pain. As he said, "The statement was 
inappropriate," he did make an apology, but his facial 
expression reeked of the pain of having to make a statement in 
which he had no true conviction. 
  This incident will be forgotten by society because of his 
removal from the position, until someone else makes a problem 
statement. Instead of considering the matter closed, there is a 
need to thoroughly evaluate the significance of this statement. 
  There's the logical criticism asking, "Why did they appoint 
an individual with such ideas as minister of justice?" But, I do 
not agree. Perhaps they appointed him as minister of justice 
because he was an individual who "embraced such ideas." 
  Mr. Nagano once served in the highest position in the Ground 
Self-Defense Force as chief of staff. He also served as an 
influential member of the Ozawa Research Council during the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] days. Accordingly, I feel that 
his appointment as minister of justice was not unrelated to the 
situation in the Korean peninsula. 
  The most controversial issue in the process of formulating 
the basic policies for the coalition parties was measures to be 
taken in response to the situation on the Korean peninsula. And, 
even during the secret conferences held at the Prime Minister's 
Official Residence during the Hosokawa government days, the 
foremost issue tabled was "the legal basis for actions in the 
event of an emergency." 
  The cabinet's Legislation Bureau asserted that actions 
feasible under current law were very limited. For that reason, 
legislation visualizing "emergencies" became a new issue for the 
coalition government. The basic agreement of the coalition 
parties reads, "The government will make provision for 
responding to emergency situations under the provisions of the 
Japanese Constitution." They made provision for possible new 
legislation or revision of existing law by referring to the 
"current constitution" rather than "current law." 
  Perhaps the foremost issue for the Hata cabinet includes a 
response to the situation on the Korean peninsula and to use the 
response as a basis for making provision for "national 
emergencies." Even Koji Kakizawa, who accomplished the unusual 
feat of being appointed as foreign minister immediately 
following his resignation from the LDP, has stated, "We need to 
consider what sort of issues will face us in an emergency and 
what sort of legislation is necessary." 
  Accordingly, we should view Mr. Nagano's appointment to the 
cabinet as designed to provide for preparation of legislation 
reflective of security concerns. In the past, the minister of 
justice's position attracted attention as being associated with 
prosecutors in charge of investigation of corruption cases. 
However, I cannot help but be amazed at the Nagano statement for 
its brilliance in striking the blind spot of public opinion. 
  Such ulterior motives clearly conflict with Prime Minister 
Hata's position in which he states that he shares former Prime 
Minister Hosokawa's opinion about "responsibility for World War 
II." The prime minister's response to the Nagano statement 
reflected a kind of hesitancy most probably because the 
appointment to the position of minister of justice was not Mr. 
Hata's idea, but Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa's way 
of preparing for the establishment of a national emergency 
system. 
  Mr. Ozawa is steadily making preparations towards realizing 
his professed goal of a "normal nation." His consistency in 
working towards that goal reflects no hesitancy whatsoever. The 
problem is that most of the public and the political world, 
including Prime Minister Hata, have not become aware of that 
fact. 
  There is one more aspect to be considered. That aspect 
concerns the question of whether Mr. Nagano who is a graduate of 
the Army Academy, former Japanese army officer, and former chief 
of staff of the Ground Self-Defense Force, qualifies as a 
"civilian" as defined in the second paragraph of Article 66 of 
the Constitution which reads, "The prime minister and other 
ministers of state must be civilians." 
  Just like the controversy about whether the Self-Defense 
Forces constitute a "military organization," there are a variety 
of positions on the term "civilians." The pros and cons of this 
issue should be debated as long as positions exist like that of 
Nobuyoshi Ashibe, who states in his book, The 
Constitution, "The growth of the Self-Defense Forces has 
evolved into the strong theory that members of the Self-Defense 
Forces are not civilians, meaning civilians must be those who 
are not career military personnel and those who never served as 
career military personnel." 
  Incidents encompassing "problem statements, unfavorable 
reactions from Asian nations, and removal of cabinet officials" 
concerning Japan's responsibilities for World War II continue 
forever, because we have not arrived at a historical conclusion 
as to exactly what we had done in connection with World War II. 
  Next year will mark the 50th anniversary of the ending of 
World War II. Unless we complete an examination which accurately 
portrays the facts, we will be prone to repeat the same mistakes 
again and again. If we merely engage in a debate of 
"aggression," it will not serve to resolve the issue in a true 
sense. Perhaps, we should begin with the task of determining 
just exactly what happened in Nanjing.

  [Text] At a meeting of the first subcommittee of the House 
of Representatives Budget Committee held on the morning of 7 
June, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai stated his views 
on how to proceed with future administrative reform, saying: 
"We will draw an outline for the immediate future as early as 
possible by forming an effective deliberation mechanism to work 
closely with the tax reform committee (of the ruling parties)." 
  He added: "In the long-term, a five-year plan will be 
formulated." 
  Kumagai's remarks indicated the government plans to draw up 
a 
five-year administrative reform plan, and deal with it through 
the implementation of a two-tier package consisting of short and 
mid-to-long-term plans. 
  He was replying to a question asked by Noboru Usami from 
Sakigake [Harbinger].

<F P=106> [Editorial] </F>
  [Text] The Ministry of Finance [MOF] submitted a 
"preliminary estimate on tax reform" to the government's Tax 
Council. It is literally no more than a preliminary estimate of 
the future outlook of the social welfare burden outlined in the 
future welfare vision program, but it gives a strong impression 
of the necessity for substantive tax increases by citing several 
theoretical cases where tax increases would be required in a 
range above 7 percent. To begin with, it is odd that the report 
makes 7 percent the starting point. They should start with a 
theoretical case wherein there is no tax increase. 
  We have always advocated that the study should be premised 
on 
the fundamental concept of "neutrality in tax revenues" in the 
sense that tax reform in all cases would reflect tax increases 
which are offset by tax decreases. The reason is that fiscal 
spending and fiscal revenues are both influenced by many 
uncertain factors and many issues remain to be discussed in 
reference to the status of tax burdens. An offsetting 
consumption tax rate for an income tax reduction of 6 trillion 
yen would be set at 5 to 6 percent. We cannot help but stress 
that the case for a real tax increase is very weak, and that it 
would be difficult to gain approval of the public for such an 
increase. As a result, we fear that tax reform itself will not 
be achievable. 
  The recent estimates were premised on 1) continuation of the 
6 trillion yen income tax cut; 2) implementation of public 
funding as visualized in the "21st Century Welfare Vision 
Program" to cover social welfare-related costs; and 3) 
redemption of government bonds used to cover tax reductions in 
10 years assuming offsetting consumption tax increases will take 
place in fiscal year 1997. Among these premises, the second one 
poses special problems. 
  The welfare vision program outlines benefit and cost 
projections for social security based on four assumed cases, 
including one case assuming continuation of current systems, but 
the recent estimate encompasses revision of the annuity system, 
increased efficiency of the medical system, and improvements in 
nursing, and is based on a so-called standard model. 
  According to the estimate, it assumes a 5-percent annual 
average growth rate in individual income and a social security 
burden in fiscal year 2000 of 21 percent of individual income 
versus 17.8 percent for fiscal year 1993, of which public 
funding based on tax revenues will amount to 6.5 percent versus 
4.8 percent for fiscal year 1993. The latter ratio of 6.5 
percent of individual income poses a problem in that it must be 
covered by fiscal funding. 
  Neither has an adequate debate taken place nor has public 
consensus been formed about social security benefit levels, 
types of benefits, and the breakdown of cost allocations such as 
social security taxes, other taxes, and self-help efforts. It is 
even possible that the tax burden can be reduced depending on 
the options selected. 
  If the public burden portion as a ratio of public income 
were 
to be reduced one point to 5.5 percent, the social 
security-related expenditures cited in the estimate would be 
reduced by 4 trillion yen in fiscal 1994. The estimate indicates 
that fiscal requirements for social security will increase by 
5.5 to 5.7 trillion yen in fiscal year 1994, but these figures 
can be reduced to a level just below 2 trillion yen. This means 
that the fiscal deficit will, of necessity, become a lesser 
issue. 
  We cannot help but say that the estimate which claims a 4-5 
trillion yen shortfall despite a consumption tax rate of 7 
percent is poorly grounded. 
  Another point of issue concerning the estimate is that it 
does not consider spontaneous growth in revenues in its 
calculations for revenues and expenditures. Tax revenues are 
very unstable in that they expand significantly during stages 
such as the bubble economy and drop during recessions like the 
current one, but as long as there are progressive income tax 
rates, tax revenue will grow faster than the economic growth 
rate over the long term. 
  As a matter of fact, the MOF has estimated that if a tax 
revenue elasticity rate of 1.1 and an increase in tax revenue at 
a multiple of 1.1 over the economic growth rate are assumed 
based on past experience, the spontaneous increase in revenues 
will be 2.8-3 trillion yen for fiscal year 1994. If these 
figures are considered, revenue and expenditures would change 
substantially. 
  The premise of calling for redemption of emergency 
government 
bonds in 10 years in the estimate lacks persuasiveness when one 
considers that ordinary government bonds are redeemed over 60 
years. If the redemption period is set at 60 years, fiscal 
expenditures which serve as the source of funds for redemption 
hardly pose a problem. 
  As demonstrated in the foregoing discussion limited to the 
premise alone, the estimate reveals MOF intentions of attempting 
to create a fiscal crisis by overestimating the fiscal 
requirements and underestimating the fiscal revenues. 
  If one were to elaborate, no mention has been made of any of 
the issues that the government should normally deal with. If 
reference were made to fiscal revenues, a revision of tax system 
inequities mentioned in the midterm report of the government's 
Tax Council should be included in calculations. As a minimum, if 
action were taken to deprive businesses of benefits accruing 
from the use of consumption tax revenues prior to deposit with 
tax agencies, it should lead to considerable revenue increases 
for the government. The effects of cost reductions based on 
administrative and fiscal reform should be similar. It would not 
be an exaggeration to say that acceptance of tax reform by the 
public depends on actions taken on these issues. 
  The MOF claims that it excluded such factors because the 
figures were not conclusive. However, in a similar vein, the 
fiscal requirements used as a premise for the estimate were also 
inconclusive. 
  What we would like to emphasize here is that we do not wish 
to deny that fiscal requirements will rise with the aging of 
society, but that the recent estimate lacks persuasiveness for 
use as a basis for increasing taxes which have a direct effect 
on the public's lifestyle. The estimate is presented in a manner 
which can only be viewed as making a tax increase an unavoidable 
conclusion. What is of concern is that such a stance could cause 
a reaction from the public which would lead to a failure in tax 
reform. 
  As repeatedly stated in the past, the pending aging of 
society will not sustain the current tax system, which relies 
excessively on income taxes. There is a need to expedite a 
restructuring of the tax system which corrects the ratio of 
direct and indirect taxes. Further delays cannot be tolerated. 
  At any rate, the previously released welfare vision program 
and the recent estimate have clarified that a major issue 
remains to be resolved in terms of benefits and burdens. 
Administrative and fiscal reform is probably an issue whose 
benefits will be steadily implemented on a long-term basis. We 
have not reached the stage where we are ready to provide a 
conclusive outline of the future of fiscal administration. 
  The foregoing discussion covered our thoughts on why we 
advocate fiscal neutrality. We are convinced that the above 
approach provides for the most logical one at the present stage. 
  The recent estimate clarified the issues that require 
resolution. We would ask that the government's Tax Council use 
the contents of the estimate as a basis for conducting a 
wide-ranging discussion.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 9 June Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] Following are the main points of the Fair Trade 
Commission [FTC] guidelines on business mergers: 
  Section 1. Mergers required to register in a simplified form 
(details omitted) 
  Section 2. Classification standards in administrative 
procedures for regular registration of mergers -- mergers 
corresponding to any of the following categories will be subject 
to vigorous examination. These categories are set for the 
purpose of classifying and inspecting cases which may violate 
the Antimonopoly Law, but cases fitting the description of the 
following categories do not necessarily mean that they actually 
violate the Antimonopoly Law. 
  (1) The market share of the merger will either be: 1) Above 
25 percent; 2) more than 15 percent and will be number one in 
the market; and 3) number one in the market, and will lead the 
number two and three groups by more than one-fourth of the total 
share of the merger. 
  (2) The market share of the merger will be number one, two, 
or three in the market, and the total share of the top three 
groups will be more than 50 percent. 
  (3) There will only be seven or fewer groups competing in 
the market. 
  (4) Either one of the merging partners has total assets of 
more than 100 billion yen, and the total assets of the other 
partner are over 10 billion yen. 
  Section 3. Factors to be taken into consideration when 
examining merger applications -- a final decision will be made 
by taking comprehensive factors into consideration, depending on 
whether the form of the merger is horizontal, vertical, or mixed. 
  (1) Horizontal mergers -- mergers that may be questionable 
under the Antimonopoly Law are mainly horizontal mergers; in 
such cases, 1) below will be given the most importance, a) under 
2) will be given secondary consideration, and b) to d) under 2) 
will be of a supplementary nature. 
  1) Market share after the merger -- market share after the 
merger, the resulting overall position of advantage in the 
market, and its relative position compared to its competitors; 
and a comparison of these three factors to that before the 
merger to see the degree of change; and import volume will of 
course be taken into consideration. 
  2) The situation of competition in the market where the 
merger will be doing business -- past trends and future plans 
will both be taken into consideration: 
  a) The situation of competition in the market 
concerned. 
  b) Business conditions in the market concerned. 
  c) Overall business capability of the merger. 
  d) The nature and environment of the market concerned. 
  (2) Vertical mergers -- in principle, factors to be 
considered for vertical mergers are similar to those cited for 
horizontal mergers, with the following included as additional 
considerations: 
  1) Degree of closedness of the market concerned. 
  2) Degree by which barriers to market participation are 
increasing. 
  (3) Mixed mergers -- for mixed mergers, in addition to 
factors cited for horizontal mergers, the following will also be 
taken into consideration: 
  1) Potential competitiveness among the merging groups. 
  2) Position of advantage after the merger. 
  3) Degree by which barriers to market participation are 
increasing. 
  Section 4. Shortening of restriction period -- Japanese 
companies cannot enter a merger less than 30 days after a merger 
application is filed. However, cases satisfying the following 
conditions will have a shorter period of restriction: 
  1) When it is evident that competition will not be 
restricted as a result of the merger. 
  2) When there are valid reasons to shorten the period of 
restriction.

  [Text] A draft plan for the revision of business merger 
guidelines compiled by the Fair Trade Commission [FTC] is 
advantageous to companies in that it makes it easier for them to 
formulate business strategies for the promotion of restructuring 
(business reconstruction) through a merger. The current 
guidelines are under criticism because "they are so abstract 
that it is difficult to understand in what cases firms will be 
allowed to enter a merger." Responding to this criticism, the 
FTC has decided to review the guidelines. However, because the 
revision is not aimed at easing standards for authorizing 
mergers, the industries will likely air their dissatisfaction. 
  The draft plan has clarified that "a 25-percent market 
share" 
is a standard for classifying mergers subject to FTC 
examination. Although the clarification is to remove the 
misunderstanding that "a 25-percent market share is a criterion 
for approving of mergers," this will also help allay the anxiety 
of companies planning mergers. 
  The draft plan has also mentioned that import volume will be 
taken into consideration in deciding whether or not a merger 
violates the Antimonopoly Law. This will enable firms to tell 
the FTC that "although our market shares are high at present, 
competition will not be restricted as a result of our merger 
because we plan to increase imports from now on." 
  Meanwhile, some industries are calling for clarifying the 
guidelines and easing classification standards to improve 
circumstances for restructuring. 
  However, the FTC is negative about complying with this call, 
saying: "If we relax standards, competition will be restricted 
in many cases as a result of mergers."

<F P=106> [Article by Takeshi Domon, critic: "By Year 2000, Imports </F>
Over 2 Million Tons May Be Constant"] 
  [Text] Dogmatic Agricultural Policy 
  Let us try retracing the recent "Heisei rice riots" just a 
bit. That a gap would appear quite early in the supply and 
demand for domestic rice had long been predicted. Probably it 
was early July 1993. About then, the people involved had seen 
that rice imports could not be avoided. By late July, there was 
even talk of the volume imported possibly being over a million 
tons. By mid-July things were such that the Food Agency director 
rushed off on an inspection of crop conditions. Quite recently, 
the Food Agency director of that time has frankly admitted to "a 
tardy decision on importing." 
  Why was it so slow? It was because the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] agricultural policy 
was a "dogmatic farm policy": We won't accept the import of even 
one grain; we'll maintain food security guarantees and domestic 
self-sufficiency in rice. (Preserving self-sufficiency is not 
dogmatic, however.) -- At that juncture, the Uruguay Round 
negotiations were being held and would get down to serious 
business in the early fall, so that in the ministry they could 
not say a word about imports. The general elections were held in 
July, and on 7 August the Hosokawa regime was born. It was about 
20 August that officials ended their summer vacations and were 
back in their offices. Then, slowly and reluctantly, they had to 
get to work on imports. 
  And yet, having a dogmatic agricultural policy, they had not 
checked on which countries raise how much of the rice that 
Japanese can eat, or how much of it is exportable. Only in 
September did all newspapers carry the data that the Food Agency 
had hastily prepared. That was statistics from the FAO [UN Food 
and Agriculture Organization] (United States Department of 
Agriculture) [as published]. But, according to that data, 14 
million tons of Japanese rice were produced in 1992. That pads 
the actual figure by as much as 40 percent. All they had in hand 
were such flimsy statistics. Then they urged trading companies 
to collect information on rice produced everywhere, and it may 
have been about 10 September that they were finally becoming 
prepared. Next, they had the trading companies make purchases. 
It was mid-September when that finally began operating. It was 
about 20 September when the Chicago grain market price shot 
upward, underscoring this. 
  How much was bought as a result? As for rice produced last 
year, in the United States and Australia most was raised under 
contract. Thailand produces just a little Japonica rice. Next, 
making the confusion worse, they bought processed rice, saying 
it was for staple food, and made the public eat that. Moreover, 
it was at such extralegal prices... It is blunder after blunder. 
  So, why did it go so far as "rice riots"? From about the 
time of the 1992 crop they knew that rice stocks were 
inadequate. So, the open-market rice price was high in early 
1993. What did the Food Agency do then? They quit publishing 
their supply and demand program. Things turned strange from that 
point; and since they were keeping the data hidden, instability 
on the market evoked even more instability. The reason the 
instability did not quiet down after the uproar began, no matter 
how many appeals the Food Agency and MAFF made on television, 
may have been because of their keeping all the information 
secret and not agreeing to make it public. 
  The elderly want to eat the domestic rice they have consumed 
for many years. So, they frantically tried to get domestic rice. 
This is natural for consumers. And yet, the Food Agency is now 
trying to shift responsibility for that to some of the free rice 
dealers. However, that is wrong; and, particularly because they 
had kept the information hidden until the panic broke out, the 
instability grew more violent. That means the responsibility of 
the Food Agency and agricultural policy is greater. They opened 
up a gap of as much as 2.7-2.8 million tons and still their 
after-the-fact handling was almost haphazard. 
  So, how will it be this year? To predict that, one must 
better analyze the structural reasons for why we had a crop 
failure last year. It is wrong simply to pass it off by saying 
it was the bad weather. 
  There are a number of primary factors, the greatest being a 
structural cause: a decline in farmers' technological 
capacities. Since farmers for whom that is a secondary or side 
job are the overwhelming majority, they squeeze rice planting in 
during the May holidays. For both Aomori and Iwate, where the 
index of planting conditions was extremely bad, the best time 
for rice planting was about 18 May; but they did it during the 
early May holidays since they could not get time off. When they 
plant before temperatures have risen, damage will be great even 
from slight weather fluctuations. 
  There also are problems with the varieties planted. Farmers 
say they cannot sell rice which is not the tasty Koshihikari 
strain of rice. This tendency grew strong especially with the 
market created in Tokyo and Osaka from December 1990. Yet, what 
we call agriculture has its basis in the proper land and proper 
crops. That is being disregarded. 
  So, one cannot attribute the rice shortage of 2.7 million 
tons to weather factors alone. The extreme decline in farmers' 
technical abilities made it even worse. And the primary causes 
for the decline in their technical abilities are the food 
control system which postwar farm policies created and the paddy 
reduction policy. So long as these structures are not quickly 
changed, it is quite possible that the same kind of damage will 
emerge hereafter, too. 
<H5>  Agricultural Policy Reform: Year One </H5>
  I believe this year is a very vital one for Japan's rice 
farming. Last December, the rice issue in the Uruguay Round was 
resolved in the form of a partial opening. I divide the time 
after that into three stages. First, 1994 is the first stage. 
1995-2000, the period of minimum access, is the second stage. 
And 2001 and beyond is the third stage, that of tariffication. 
  I think this first-stage year should be year one for reforms 
in agricultural policy. Which is to say that during the six 
years starting next year agricultural policy reforms will be 
required, differing from the past by giving answers within set 
time limits. Then, in 2001 tariffication will begin. The MAFF 
says it has not necessarily promised tariffication, but that is 
false. It may have been given a grace period for the very reason 
that it gave a secret promise of tariffication. All the more 
reason why it must take on reform of agricultural policy with 
firm resolve. 
  What should it have done first this year? I think it should, 
in principle, have abolished paddy reduction and let rice be 
produced freely. Having the least price flexibility, grains need 
production coordination. But, there are problems in enforcement 
by community units, disregarding the individual's capacity for 
ingenuity, as our country's paddy-reduction policy has done. The 
MAFF says it has not used compulsion; but it has simply avoided 
soiling its own hands, using other ways to make local 
governments and agricultural cooperatives do it. Farmers have 
been angered by repeated paddy reductions, and the best young 
people have all left. 
  What is vital is to let them produce freely. Also, subsidies 
would not be given to those producing freely. Instead, they 
would be allowed to sell freely. That is the foundation and is 
so-called optional production regulation. For those agreeing to 
production regulation, a set subsidy would be given. It is quite 
unfair to treat farmers with small farms and large-scale farmers 
the same in this. 
  Yet, the government says that in the Uruguay Round 
negotiations last year it reluctantly agreed to market opening. 
That is false. The Food Agency well knows that if the market is 
not open there will be major trouble with its supply and demand 
program after the year 2000. They have done a certain simulation 
but are hiding it carefully. It says that, even if paddy 
reductions all cease after the year 2000, there will be constant 
shortages of two to three million tons just like last year's. 
  One proof of that is in the pamphlet Points of a New 
Policy, which they put out. In it is to be found "Trends 
and Outlook for Those Engaged in Mainline Agriculture." This is 
a simulation, which the MAFF based on the 1990 census, of how 
the number of persons engaged in mainline agriculture will 
change by the year 2000. For example, persons including both men 
and women under age 60 engaged in mainline agriculture numbered 
1.62 million in 1990. By 2000 they will number 810,000--just 
half as many. If those engaged in agriculture fall by half, a 
simple calculation would show that current productivity cannot 
be sustained unless the area each person farms doubles. Will it 
double in the next seven years? That is hopelessly impossible. 
  If they cannot reform agricultural policy hereafter, a 
supply 
shortage of 2.5 million tons of rice will become an established 
fact, even if paddy reductions are eased. An era in which, if 
one eats four bowls of rice one would be imported rice, would 
come to stay after 2000. Not only that, but if we have slightly 
unusual weather like last year there could be shortages of 4-5 
million tons and we could even see an era where one of every two 
bowls of rice would be imported rice. 
  So, was not such a to-do created now because their awareness 
of the situation was too easy going? That is how hard-pressed 
Japan's agriculture is becoming. 
<H5>  Induction of Competition Principle </H5>
  Naturally, reform of the food control system will be 
necessary. Indeed, rather than reform, first it should be 
abolished. After that there should be thorough discussion in the 
nation about how food controls should be. The government's role 
is to maintain emergency reserves. If the government takes 
responsibility as an independent nation for minimal reserves, 
could it not win public approval for that? Of course it would be 
the government's duty to have a rationing system in times of 
emergency. Yet, keeping the distribution of all rice under its 
control by a staff of as many as 12,000 even in normal times is 
anachronistic in the extreme. 
  Moreover, food control and distribution is multi-tiered and 
based on farm cooperative organizational lines. The basic form 
is, first, from the primary collection agents to the economic 
associations, national farm cooperative association, 
wholesalers, retailers, and finally to consumers. Among other 
products, there are few that go through a distribution process 
of five to six stages. The stance is clear of vainly claiming a 
role for food controls in times of emergency and then protecting 
entrepreneurs with interests which they cling to. Farmers, too, 
should think about what merits the food control system has for 
them as producers. 
  Aside from this year, a 72-liter sack of ordinary rice is 
33,000 to 34,000 yen at the retail stage. With the producing 
farmers' take at 20,000 yen, a margin of 13,000 yen or almost 40 
percent being added on is itself fundamentally strange. Is as 
much as 40 percent in intermediate distribution costs necessary? 
This should be thoroughly debated. The distribution of other 
products has been considerably rationalized, with pluses for 
producers and consumers alike. And yet, the food control system 
benefits neither producers nor consumers. The intermediate 
entrepreneurs in agricultural cooperative organizations and in 
wholesaling and retailing are taking a considerable margin. As 
all are licensed tradesmen, the competition principle ultimately 
does not operate. 
  Henceforth we will enter the era of tariffication. Imported 
rice will come in constantly. Dramatic arguments will fly about 
such as that imported rice is risky and domestic rice is safe. 
This campaign waged by the central body of the national farm 
co-ops mocks producers and consumers alike. From now on, price, 
safety and flavor are things the consumer will choose. That is 
what the age of tariffication will be. The period for getting 
ready for that should be thought of as that of minimum access. 
  What are we to do specifically to reform agricultural 
policy? 
First of all, we should abolish the food control system, and the 
government should play a minimal role, such as keeping a set 
amount in reserve. A staff of 3,000 would suffice. Then, freeing 
up domestic distribution, it should quickly accept the entry of 
new wholesalers and retailers. Competition principles would be 
introduced also for agricultural cooperatives. All should be 
competing. If that is done, rice consumption will surely grow. 
To reform agriculture or distribution while limiting new entries 
and protecting vested interests would be like spitting into the 
wind. 
  With the farm population declining, we must devise measures 
for the successors with firm resolve. New entries have increased 
considerably in truck farming. Their not increasing in rice 
farming is due to the existence of the food control system and 
paddy reduction policy and always taking actions that limit 
competition. To make rice farming something with appeal we will 
make the competition principle prevail. If we do so, excellent 
young people will come and join in. They will want to make money 
in agriculture. 
<H5>  Turn Attention to Farmland </H5>
  Problems with the farmland law may become the biggest topic. 
The farmland law is a bottleneck because it makes expansion in 
scale difficult. All have had their focus diverted to food 
controls and paddy reduction; but more attention should be 
directed at farmland, and public discussion should develop on it. 
  The price of farmland is too high relative to its product. 
That is because it is a price valuated as a farmer's asset 
rather than as a means of farm production. So, they do not want 
to let go of it. Thus, they cannot buy farmland and cannot 
expand in scale. If they try to lease land, no one will lend it 
to them. 
  One more problem is that of basic maintenance. The MAFF so 
far has invested much money in basic maintenance. On average its 
standard is 30 ares per paddy field; but this will not fit well 
with an era of tariffication. To date, an international sense 
and point of view on continuing to protect Japan's agriculture 
beyond the present day may have been wanting. 
  Then, what should be done? In principle, it is to ease 
limits 
on farmland ownership and instead tighten restraints on usage 
and prevent diversions. Also, for farmers wishing to expand in 
scale the government should provide 100 percent financing. In 
exchange, resale would be barred for a certain number of years. 
  The biggest point for farm administration reform henceforth 
is the course of rice prices. Now is a time of peak prices, so 
that eventually rice prices will fall. As of the year 2000, the 
price for domestically produced rice may fall by one-third of 
today's price. It is seen that in Hokkaido it will be 10,000 
yen, 15,000 yen in average locations, and the Koshihikari rice 
from Uonuma County in Niigata will possibly top 20,000 yen. The 
question will be whether, at an average of 15,000 yen, farm 
management will be commercially profitable. Farm managers must 
create this management plan. 
  What should be done to make it pay? The one thing to do is 
expand in scale. And make direct sales, eliminating the 
middleman's margin in distribution. However, since costs for 
farm direct sales such as home delivery charges are too high, I 
think that in any case it will die down unless substantial added 
value is applied to it. After all, will it not be desirable for 
the agricultural cooperatives to do it collectively or for 
large-scale producer groups to make direct sales as wholesalers 
and retailers? 
  Most important now is to incorporate as a system the 
conditions that will cause young people to come in and let their 
individual ingenuity be fully exercised. I think that is a real 
burden-carrying measure. We need to change the approach of 
agricultural policies treating the community as their 
foundation, using compulsion and subsidies to make people 
listen. We must definitely have MAFF officials become aware that 
farm policies have failed because of these things. 
  Speaking of the agricultural cooperatives, basically they 
make money on rice and financing. Agricultural co-op finances 
are extremely exposed to competition and troubled by holding 
large sums in bad loans. The same holds true, too, for 
rice--their other pillar of support. Last fiscal year more than 
2 million tons of rice were imported; so their commissions were 
down for fertilizer and other farm chemicals for domestically 
produced rice. What are agricultural cooperatives to do about 
this? Moreover, tariffication of rice, while a plus for 
producers with get-up-and-go, may ultimately see the MAFF also 
giving priority to investing in farmers who have been selected 
out. At such time, if the agricultural cooperatives do not take 
countermeasures they will suffer their worst damage. 
  What is important is for the agricultural cooperatives 
themselves to use this six years of minimum access era to create 
low-cost production and distribution systems. Without that, when 
tariffication begins in the year 2001 it will set up conditions 
under which they would not even be in the arena of competition. 
In name and fact it would mean the agricultural cooperatives 
would be completely forsaken. 
  There are a variety of limiting conditions; but if reform of 
agricultural administration can be accomplished, superior 
farmers will thrive. Nor must the agricultural cooperatives fear 
competition. It is competition that is the wellspring of 
development. So, may not the only way to survive be to make a 
100-percent change in past ways of doing things?

<H5>  Problems With the System </H5>
  A huge public works scandal erupted with the arrest of LDP 
[Liberal Democratic Party] vice president Shin Kanemaru on 
suspicion of tax evasion early last year. Since that time, 
several Diet members and heads of municipalities have been 
arrested on charges of graft or influence peddling. After this 
scandal broke, there has been an attempt to reform the bidding 
process for public works projects. In December 1993 the "Special 
Committee on Public Works" of the Central Construction Industry 
Commission issued the following recommendations: 1) replace the 
private-tender bidding system with a more competitive system; 2) 
abolish the guarantor system for project completion; and 3) 
create a bidding oversight council. These recommendations are 
currently being put into effect. These efforts constitute the 
most significant reforms since the competitive private-tender 
bidding system was introduced in 1900. 
  During the open debate on public works in the mass media, 
the collusion between general contractors and heads of 
municipalities received the most attention. Since then, however, 
several problems with the public works system have surfaced. 
  First, the number of politicians accepting illegal 
contributions in exchange for public works contracts is not 
limited to heads of municipalities. Several Diet members have 
been arrested or implicated for overstepping their authority. 
  Second, many career civil servants have retired to take 
positions with general contractors, inviting suspicion of 
collusion between those placing orders for public works 
contracts and those receiving the orders. 
  Third, dango [bid-rigging by collusion among 
construction firms] has become widespread. Dango has rendered 
competition ineffective, and this is the sole reason for the 
high cost of public works projects in Japan. 
  Fourth, the number of public works contracts has increased 
despite staff reductions at public agencies and a relative 
decline in their technical capabilities. General contractors 
have had to cooperate with public agencies during the planning, 
design, and accounting phases without receiving compensation. If 
they do not receive the contract, companies cannot recover these 
costs. This is one reason why general contractors have used 
dango to coordinate their bids. 
  The declining ability of government agencies and municipal 
agencies to plan and design projects has also created several 
problems. For example, an exceptionally large number of public 
works projects have had to be redesigned during the construction 
phase because the original designs were inadequately prepared. 
In Western Europe and North America, large public works projects 
are evaluated during the planning stage and the results are made 
available to the public. In Japan these projects are seldom 
evaluated and the results are almost never disclosed. This is 
the single greatest cause of inefficient projects whose costs 
far exceed benefits. 
  Fifth, in Japan the government or municipal agency sets 
acceptible price ranges for bids on public works projects. These 
are supposed to remain confidential, but are often leaked to 
general contractors. 
  We will have to address these problems if we are to reform 
the bidding system for public works projects. It is often argued 
that switching to a bidding system based on open competition 
will solve all of these problems, but that is not necessarily 
true. In subsequent articles in this series, I will point out 
the critical issues that have to be considered in any redesign 
of the bidding system for public works projects. 
<H5>  [21 Apr 94 p 31] </H5>
  [Text] The Great Dilemma 
  Public works projects are carried out using tax money to 
benefit the public. Accordingly, those public agencies that 
place orders for public works have a responsibility to ensure 
that the public receives the highest quality for the lowest 
cost. In other words, the focus of the public works bidding 
system should be on "cost" and "quality." 
  It is difficult to eliminate poor quality and ensure high 
quality work in a construction contract. In order to ensure 
quality work, one must choose an honest and competent contractor 
who is motivated to insist on quality in whatever form it takes. 
  If we were able to make "quality" objective, it could be 
built into contracts. In reality, however, it is often difficult 
and even impossible to quantify something like "quality," 
especially when technologies and circumstances change. For this 
reason, contracting agencies have broad discretionary powers 
when it comes to ensuring quality. 
  Private companies need only concern themselves with issues 
of cost and quality, but in the case of public works attention 
must also be given to "fairness" and "corruption prevention." 
Private companies use their own money and thus can be 
self-serving, but since public works use taxpayer funds they 
cannot be used to benefit only certain people. Moreover, 
impropriety by the contracting party is essentially an internal 
matter for private companies, but a public issue for government 
agencies. 
  The difficulty in designing a new public works bidding 
system 
is in the trade-off between "cost," "quality," and "corruption 
prevention." It is nearly impossible to achieve all three of 
these goals perfectly in a single public works project. 
  For example, if cost minimization and corruption prevention 
were the only two goals and a perfectly open competitive bidding 
system were established, it would eliminate dango. If under the 
open bidding system the lowest bid automatically won the 
contract, it would eliminate corruption because the contracting 
agency would not have any discretionary powers at all. If the 
contracting agency were unable to tamper with the process in 
response to bribes, influence peddling would disappear. 
  However if price were the only factor in the open bidding 
system, this would cause quality problems. If lower costs were 
the primary objective, contractors would cut corners and shoddy 
workmanship would result. 
  Moreover, if cost minimization and quality assurance were 
the 
only two goals, the contracting agency would need discretionary 
powers to appraise quality in order to balance these two 
objectives. However if the contracting agency is given 
discretionary powers, the possibility of corruption occurs. It 
is often argued that regular rotation of officials and strict 
penalties would severely limit corruption in the professional 
civil service ranks, but the structural collusion resulting from 
the illegal influence of politicians as well as former civil 
servants taking positions with general contractors would remain. 
  It is therefore impossible to create a public procurement 
system that can meet these three objectives perfectly. Under the 
current system, a delicate balance is maintained between these 
three objectives. Whatever system is adopted, there is an 
inherent incompatibility between technological, political, and 
social factors. 
<H5>  [23 Apr 94 p 31] </H5>
  [Text] Corruption Prevention and Quality Assessment 
  In order to prevent corruption in public works, the 
discretionary powers of contracting agencies must be reduced. 
This is the reason why most countries have gone to an open 
bidding system for public works contracts. 
  Under a competitive bidding system based on price alone, it 
is impossible to promise that public works contracts will go to 
specific companies. For this reason, it is possible to eliminate 
unfair practices such as contracting agencies receiving bribes 
from contractors. Since politicians also attempt to meddle with 
the process, a competitive bidding system based on price would 
also make it impossible for politicians to conspire to award 
contracts to a particular company. 
  Another advantage of a competitive bidding system is that it 
would end the problem public agencies have with cost 
consciousness. If the lowest cost bidder automatically won the 
contract, it would reduce costs even if the contracting agency 
had no incentive to do so. 
  A competitive bidding process would seem to be the ideal 
public procurement system, but it has one fatal flaw. It does 
not ensure quality. If the lowest cost bidder won every contract 
and there was a rise in instances of shoddy workmanship due to 
cost-cutting measures, the ultimate cost to the public could 
actually increase. 
  In order to ensure quality in a competitive bidding system 
based on price, detailed quality specifications would have to be 
laid out before bidding took place. Rigorous inspections would 
have to be conducted after the construction was completed to 
ensure compliance. This may be difficult to verify. Some of my 
readers may have had the experience of laying down clear 
guidelines for the construction of a new home. After the house 
is built, some of you may have discovered how difficult it is to 
determine whether the contractor used the specified materials 
behind the walls. Even in the relatively simple case of a 
private residence, innumerable inspections are required. When a 
contractor places an extremely low cost bid, the chance of 
shoddy workmanship rises. 
  Some form of oversight will be needed in the public works 
bidding system to ensure quality work and to eliminate defective 
workmanship. Every country has some kind of inspection process, 
and there is no such thing as a purely competitive system 
without quality considerations. 
  In the United States the federal government has a 
competitive 
bidding system, but bidders must be underwritten by bond 
companies or insurance companies. These companies conduct 
studies prior to the placement of the bid. 
  These companies conduct inspections after a contract has 
been 
awarded as well. In order to ensure that construction is 
completed as specified, both the contracting agency and the 
insurance company conduct inspections. The contracting agency 
usually focuses its attention on the more technical aspects. The 
inspection process is extremely severe on companies that do not 
obtain the desired results. The detailed inspections include 
interviews with engineers and technicians. 
  Every country conducts investigations, but the timing and 
methods vary. The openness and transparency of these inspections 
also vary. The Japanese private-tender bidding system is unique 
in concentrating its investigations at the time of bidding. The 
contracting agency has broad discretionary powers to conduct 
inspections, and the results are not made public. 
<H5>  [24 Apr 94 p 22] </H5>
  [Text] Two Sides of Discretionary Power 
  Despite the fact that inspections are inadequate when it 
comes to ensuring product quality, they form the heart of all 
public works bidding systems. 
  If inspectors are made responsible only for objective 
criteria and their discretionary powers are eliminated, then the 
opportunities for corruption will be greatly reduced. Although 
all elements that are objectifiable should be made objective, 
problems remain. 
  Professor Kelman at Harvard University conducted a case 
study 
on public procurement of computer systems in the United States 
and published the results in Procurement and Public 
Management (1990). According to his study, excessive 
objectification of demands produces great inefficiencies. Under 
the U.S. procurement system, a party which is not the lowest 
cost bidder can win a contract, but claims of superior quality 
must be objectively demonstrated. However, past experience is 
not considered significant. 
  For example, in one case when a government computer system 
would go down, the contractor often did not send the appropriate 
specialist. Instead it would send a less qualified technician. 
Despite this track record, the competent authorities considered 
this subjective information and would disregard it during 
procurement bidding for new government contracts. In order to 
build the case that the contractor's support services were 
substandard, the contracting agency would have to limit its 
inquiry to statistical data from studies conducted by other 
government agencies and private firms. Under such an 
arrangement, support services continue to deteriorate because 
the extra effort and cost associated with improving support 
services have no bearing at all on whether the company will 
receive any new government contracts. 
  Therefore, excessively objective demands in the review 
process harm quality assurance. But if these objective standards 
are relaxed and discretionary powers increased, there is no 
assurance this discretionary power will only be used to improve 
quality. The old Japanese National Railways (JNR) established 
more flexible standards in order to improve quality, but the 
public corporation began to use extremely expensive special 
parts. It is said this occurred primarily to ensure lucrative 
positions in these special parts companies for retired JNR 
officials. 
  While discretionary powers must be given to contracting 
agencies in order to ensure quality work, organizational 
measures are also needed to make sure that these discretionary 
powers are exercised properly. 
  First, efforts to expose and punish wrongdoing should be 
strengthened in order to prevent the abuse of this discretionary 
power in the form of bribe-taking. Politicians have also been 
implicated in public procurement corruption scandals, because it 
is difficult to penalize them for overstepping their authority. 
If something is not done to strengthen jurisdictional barriers, 
political-influence scandals will only intensify. 
  Second, public disclosure and an effective system of formal 
complaints would help eliminate criminal abuse and arbitrary use 
of discretionary powers. In western Europe and North America, 
all uses of discretionary power by whomever for whatever purpose 
is made public. This does not happen in Japan. The public must 
have confidence that such discretionary powers are being used 
properly.

  [Text] Dango Prevention and Dumping 
  Competition is the most effective way to lower construction 
costs. Japanese construction costs are relatively high compared 
to western Europe and North America, and much of this can be 
attributed to the lack of competition resulting from the spread 
of dango. Since last year bidding prices have been dropping with 
the breakup of some dango, but the elimination of dango is still 
a long way off. 
  Economists have recently begun to study competitive bidding. 
According to Tatsuyoshi Saijo, an assistant professor of 
economics at Tsukuba University, dango somehow quickly forms if 
bidders are allowed to confer with each other. Consequently, one 
could say that it would be extremely difficult to prevent dango 
if an environment is created in which bidders are able to confer. 
  In order to prevent dango, we must rigorously enforce a 
prohibition on contact between bidders as they do in the United 
States, or actively support outsiders who have not participated 
in meetings with other bidders in the past. Under a restricted 
competitive bidding system, there are geographical limitations 
on qualified bidders. This only encourages the tacit formation 
of dango. The recent reforms have also abolished the guarantor 
system for project completion and have placed limits on joint 
ventures. This has made conferences between bidders all but 
inevitable, and has created a hotbed for dango. 
  Recently, Chairman Maeda of the Japan Federation of 
Construction Industry Organization called for self-restraint 
concerning contract "dumping." His comments have evoked much 
criticism. If there were no dango, low priced bids would begin 
to emerge. 
  Naturally, there is a possibility of shoddy workmanship with 
low priced bids, but stronger industry oversight and penalties 
for negligence are the proper response. 
  With price competition, many new companies have emerged in 
regions outside the major metropolitan areas. Companies that 
could not compete under the private tender system have also been 
revived by open competition. However, few of these companies 
have resorted to intentionally negligent work in order to build 
a track record and increase market share. In such circumstances, 
the elimination of price competition by establishing price 
floors would do even more harm. 
  Loss-generating contracts due to intensive price competition 
have increased the overcapacity problems of an industry already 
in recession. For example, many companies have too many 
engineers and not enough work. Even though some have idled their 
engineers, they must still pay their salaries. By placing bids 
under cost, they create work for their idle engineers and reduce 
the expense of keeping them on the payroll. However, once 
prosperity returns and demand outstrips supply, these companies 
turn a profit. 
  Regulating low cost bids in order to prevent loss-generating 
contracts will only create a situation in which there is 
constant overcapacity and lead to even more excessive 
competition. Price floors intended to support the industry in 
times of recession will only encourage overcapacity by 
encouraging new companies to enter the fray. It will also help 
inefficient companies to survive. 
<H5>  [26 Apr 94 p 25] </H5>
  [Text] Peculiar Price Estimate System 
  Japan's price estimate system, by which bidders calculate 
their costs, does not allow contracts to be awarded above a 
certain price. This strict price estimate system is peculiar to 
Japan. In western Europe and North America proposals are usually 
allowed to fall within a certain range. Where price estimates 
are set, differences in price estimates can vary by as much as 
10 percent (for example) within a fixed range. More contract 
awards are thus determined by price estimates. 
  Because bidders take part in dango, there would be no upper 
limit on cost increases if not for price estimates. With the 
spread of dango, price estimates are the only means of 
restraining the skyrocketing price of successful bids. However, 
if recent reforms are successful at preventing the dango, then 
the need for price estimates will decrease. 
  According to "accounting laws governing estimates and 
account 
statements," price estimates must be kept confidential until the 
bidding actually occurs. There is no rule stating that price 
estimates cannot be made public after the bidding process is 
over, but it is rarely done. 
  Stories of leaked price estimates have appeared in the 
press, 
and the most recent bidding system reforms have centered on the 
question of whether or not confidential price estimates have any 
purpose. 
  According to economic studies of the competitive bidding 
process, price ceilings can sometimes serve to reduce the price 
of the successful bid. However, it works best if these price 
ceilings are known to bidders prior to the bidding process. 
Confidentiality, as in the Japanese case, makes little sense. 
Confidential price estimates only increase the insecurity of the 
bidders in the process. 
  Services such as auction houses set the lowest acceptable 
price at the start of bidding. The starting price, or lowest 
acceptable price, is usually made public prior to the auction. 
Because the price limits are determined by an expert appraisal 
specialist, disclosing price limits has the same effect as 
disclosing appraisal information. Making appraisals public is 
believed to narrow price differentials among bidders and 
intensify the competition. 
  Prior disclosures of price estimates are prohibited in 
Japan, 
but ex post facto disclosures are not. Because of the 
proliferation of dango in Japanese public works bidding, winning 
contracts are often said to be nearly identical to the price 
estimate. If the price estimate were publicly disclosed after 
the bidding, the situation would become more clear. It would 
serve to curtail the activities of dango. The winning bid would 
come in lower than the price estimate in order to conceal the 
existence of dango. At the very least, it would hold down costs. 
Because there does not appear to be any harm in ex post facto 
disclosures, there is no reason why price estimates should not 
be made public after bidding has closed. 
  In addition to the problems addressed in this series of 
articles, there are other issues that have to be considered when 
reforming the bidding system, such as introducing a construction 
management (CM) system and improving quality in the planning and 
design stages. I hope to have another opportunity to examine 
these problems at a later date.

"Classified Paper on 'Watered-Down Report' of the Hiraiwa 
Committee Reveals the 'Evil Influence' of Bureaucrats"] 
  [Text] The bureaucracy's resistance is blocking reform and 
hurting Japan. An unpublished document carried in the June 
issue of THIS IS YOMIURI magazine vividly reveals how the 
bureaucrats are casting shadows and throwing cold water on the 
political leadership. 
  Following the establishment of the Hosokawa coalition 
government, there were calls for establishing an open economy, 
and the Economic Reform Study Committee [commonly called the 
Hiraiwa Committee] was organized. The Hiraiwa Committee 
submitted the interim and final reports on Japanese economic 
reform in November and December last year, respectively. The 
Hiraiwa Reports were expected to put forward strong guidelines 
and concrete plans to stimulate Japan's languishing economy and 
open its markets to the international community. However, the 
final report was characterized as "watered down." 
  The Hiraiwa Committee had had two points to discuss. The 
first was which character to give supervisory organs in order to 
have them steadily carry out deregulation, a pillar of economic 
reform. The second point was where to set the deadline for such 
deregulation. If these two points are strictly determined, the 
regulations will be steadily relaxed; if in the end they are 
loosely set, economic reform ultimately will be only so much 
fanfare without results. 
  Let me cite examples from THIS IS YOMIURI on these two 
points 
and quote the committee members from the bureaucracy to see how 
they worked to protect the interests of their particular 
government agencies. Following is an argument over the 
character to give a third-party organ to supervise the execution 
of deregulation. 
  [Professor Iwao Nakatani of Hitotsubashi University] -- It 
is 
common sense in advanced nations to have an organization that 
raises grievances with a government's administrative branch and 
discuss matters. A similar supervisory organization is needed 
for Japan. 
  [Yoshihiko Yoshino, presently governor of the Japan 
Development Bank and formerly Ministry of Finance [MOF] 
administrative vice minister] -- It is very difficult to set up 
a third-party organization for the administrative branch of 
government. It is going too far to have one with the character 
of the Fourth Estate completely independent of the 
administration or one that can go into administrative agencies 
and inspect them. 
  [Kenichi Kakudo, chairman of Norin Chukin--the Central Bank 
for Agriculture and Forestry--and Ministry of Agriculture, 
Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] vice minister] -- It is an 
extraordinarily serious issue for an independent third-party 
organ to go into administrative agencies and inspect them. 
  These arguments well convey the determination of committee 
members from the bureaucracy to prevent others from doing 
anything to the place of origin, the executive branch. Other 
committee members, who were not bureaucrats, made the following 
remarks regarding this. 
  [Toshio Suzuki, chairman of the Nomura Research Institute] 
-- 
It will probably be better for Diet members themselves to 
propose legislation on establishing a third-party organ. 
  Since the administrative branch is responsible for carrying 
out deregulation, there is no sense in having a supervisory 
organ created on the administrative side. It is self-evident 
that the legislative branch should establish such an 
organization. But committee members originating in the 
bureaucracy again put up a fierce resistance. 
  [Former MOF Vice Minister Yoshino] -- What in the world do 
you mean by your calling for a legislative proposal devised by 
Diet members for establishing a third-party organ? If you mean 
that the government cannot be trusted, there is no meaning in 
having this group make suggestions to the government. It goes 
too far to propose a legislative bill. 
  [Former MAFF Vice Minister Kakudo] -- It is going far too 
far. 
  [Suzuki] The idea did not come from distrust of the 
government. I would like to have the legislative branch have 
responsibility in this matter. 
  Through these debates, the third-party organ in charge of 
promoting and supervising deregulation was defined as "a strong 
organization, based on law, with its own independent office and 
the right to making recommendations." But as a matter of fact, 
it has become a far less independent entity compared to the Fair 
Trade Commission supported by Article 3 of the Law on National 
Administrative Organizations. 
  Next comes the term of carrying out deregulation. 
  [Suzuki] A five-year term was mentioned on one item. But 
there is no other mention of deadlines. I would like to hear 
the views of this committee's members. 
  [Hiroko Ota, visiting associate professor at Osaka 
University] It is important to specify deadlines for abolishing 
regulations. 
  [Kakudo] Regulations have their own circumstances and 
reasons for how and why they were introduced. So, an 
across-the-board deadline (for deregulation) may pose a problem. 
  In the end, an abstract mention of "a large-scale reduction 
in five years" was made in the report. 
  The report thus was watered down by resistance of the 
bureaucracy. The inside document made me feel that the first 
step to move away from being a bureaucratic nation is to make 
public the circumstances involving the report and to let the 
people see for themselves the realities of the bureaucracy.

Bureau, Ministry of Finance: "When It Comes to Trade Surpluses, 
Keep an Eye on Volume Data"] 
  [Text] Volume Data Substantiate "Effects of the 
J-Curve" in Trade With United States and Reflect Trends 
Accurately 
  1) When there is a sharp increase in the value of the 
yen as was the case in 1993, an accurate appraisal of Japan's 
foreign trade trends requires focused attention on changes in 
volume data which reflects a clear picture of foreign trade 
transactions. 
  2) When the subject concerns the sharply increasing 
Japan's trade surplus, it is insufficient to track only the 
monetary aspects of trends. There is a need to effectively 
appraise the factors which cause trade surpluses by principal 
regions such as the United States, the European Union (EU) and 
Asia. 
  3) The Ministry of Finance (MOF) recently decided to 
publish a trade index categorized by principal regions such as 
the United States. This index clearly provides numerical 
substantiation that the "effects of the J-curve served as the 
basis for the increase in foreign trade surplus with the United 
States in 1993 on a dollar basis. 
<H5>  Indicators Expressed in Yen and Dollar Reflect Differing </H5>
Results 
  An examination of Japan's foreign trade trends for 1993 
shows 
that the trade surplus declined for the first time in three 
years on a yen basis, but that it increased and hit a record 
high for three years in a row on a dollar basis. Whether the 
foreign trade trends are viewed on a yen basis or a dollar basis 
makes a difference in arriving at the result of trend analysis. 
  The reason for this phenomenon is that when the value of the 
yen rises sharply as it did in 1993, shifts in foreign exchange 
rates are accompanied by major shifts in prices; and shifts in 
export and import volumes expressed in monetary values are 
strongly impacted by price factors. Accordingly, it is believed 
that an accurate appraisal of Japan's foreign trade trends 
requires focusing of attention on changes in volume data for 
"commodities," providing an unadulterated picture of foreign 
trade transactions without regard for indicators based on the 
yen or the dollar. 
  Export and import volume data are compiled on the basis of 
unit for motor vehicles and tonnage for steel. Although it is 
possible to appraise volume by each of the respective categories 
of commodities, it is not possible to easily summarize export 
and import volume data for an entire nation as can be done in 
monetary terms because of the existence of unit count and weight 
in quantifying volumes for each commodity category. Even the 
trend is difficult to appraise on an overall basis. 
  However, observations of movements in the "volume index," 
among the trade indices published by the MOF, can provide an 
appraisal for export and import trends on a volume basis for the 
nation as a whole. 
  Further, export and import values can be arrived at by 
multiplying prices and volumes. It is known that if such data is 
converted to trade indices, that, generally speaking, the growth 
in monetary values can be expressed as an approximation of the 
sum of growth in the price and volume indices. This relationship 
can be used to analytically group export and import monetary 
value changes into price factors and volume factors. 
Accordingly, the use of foreign trade indices can provide an 
analysis and appraisal for the causes of Japan's trade surplus 
in terms of price and volume. 
  Trade indices are one of the very important economic indices 
in accurately appraising Japan's foreign trade trends, and the 
MOF has compiled trade indices that supplement past worldwide 
foreign trade indices, categorized by principal regions such as 
the United States, the EU, and Asia, which provide the primary 
objective of 1) appraising export and import trends for each 
region on a volume basis and 2) analyzing changes in regional 
trade surpluses on a price and volume basis. The new indices are 
released beginning in March 1994, following approval by the 
Statistics Council. 
<H5>  Reduction in Volume Which Lags Rise in Prices </H5>
  First, let us take a look at trends in the volume of exports 
and imports with the United States in 1993. 
  Export volumes decreased 1.8 percent owing to commodities 
such as motor vehicles which declined because of the strong yen 
and attendant growth in local production while import volumes 
increased 2.4 percent reflecting increases in imports of 
commodities such as motor vehicles, electronic components such 
as semiconductors, and clothing. Also, trends in January and 
February 1994 were similar to those in 1993. A look at monthly 
volume indices for the United States further shows that export 
volumes are in a declining trend and that import volumes are in 
an increasing trend. 
  A look at trends based on prices indicates that export 
prices 
expressed in dollars have increased 12.1 percent, but this 
reflects a rise of 13.7 percent in the yen's value in 1993. The 
10.0 percent rise in exports to the United States in 1993 on a 
dollar basis reflects the effect of the strong yen, causing a 
rise of 12.1 percent in prices, whereas volume fell 1.8 percent. 
Imports from the United States rose 5.8 percent because of a 
rise in volume and prices. 
  Accordingly, if an immediate decrease in export volume 
commensurate with the rise in export prices had been realized, 
exports to the United States would have failed to expand. 
However, as is known under what is generally referred to as 
"effects of the J-curve," when the value of the yen rises 
sharply, export prices on a dollar basis rise steeply and export 
volume trends lag are reflected in statistics on a gradual 
basis. Therefore, reductions in export volumes commensurate with 
rises in export prices are normally not reflected immediately. 
  Additionally, increases in import volumes also lag in 
manifesting themselves in response to changes in foreign 
exchange rates. As a result, trade surpluses increase on a 
short-term basis, and the aforementioned trade indices 
indisputably attest to the manifestation of this phenomenon on a 
numerical basis. In other words, the major increase in trade 
surplus with the United States in 1993 is a reflection of the 
effects of the rise in export prices on a dollar basis arising 
from a significantly stronger yen as depicted in the so-called 
"effects of the J-curve," despite a decrease in export volumes 
and an increase in import volumes. 
  Next, let us take a look at trends in export and import 
volumes with the EU in 1993. 
  Export volume recorded a significant decrease of 14.2 
percent 
owing to effects of the strong yen and drop in exports for 
commodities such as motor vehicles because of the recession in 
the EU economy. On the other hand, import volume fell 1.6 
percent overall because of a decline in imports of luxury items 
such as fashion apparel and expensive automobiles. Additionally, 
in January and February 1994, export volume trends remained the 
same as in 1993, but import volumes rose. 
  Price-wise, dollar-based export price hikes have been 
limited 
to 5.2 percent, but this trend conceivably reflects the effects 
of a strong yen and the shift of exports from high-priced items 
to lower-priced items owing to the recession in the EU economy. 
As a result, exports to the EU on a dollar basis declined 
substantially by 9.7 percent because of a significant drop on a 
volume basis while imports declined modestly in terms of volume 
and price and thus limiting the decline to 3.6 percent. 
Accordingly, the major decline in trade surplus with the EU in 
1993 primarily reflects a major decline in export volume. 
<H5>  Importance of Regional Factor Analysis </H5>
  Finally, let us take a look at trends in export and import 
volumes relative to Asia in 1993. 
  Export volume to Asia increased 7.4 percent including motor 
vehicles, steel, and visual equipment owing to the favorable 
economic climate in that area. On the other hand, import volumes 
rose 6.5 percent because of increased imports of items such as 
clothing and audiovisual equipment owing to progress in the 
localization of production. Further, trends for 1993 extended 
themselves in January and February 1994. 
  Both export and import volumes increased significantly in 
relation to Asia, but a major contributor to this trend was the 
active pace of trade with principal constituent regions such as 
China. A look at export and import volumes in relation to China 
indicates a favorable Chinese economy in recent times and a 
conspicuous rise of 37.6 percent in export volume and of 22.3 
percent in import volume. 
  Exports to Asia rose sharply by 16.0 percent reflecting a 
rise in export volume and an 8.0 percent jump in export prices 
on a dollar basis. On the other hand, imports from Asia rose 8.9 
percent reflecting an increase in both volume and prices. 
  Thus, in 1993 the trade surplus with Asia rose to a record 
high of $53.6 billion to a level surpassing the trade surplus 
with the United States, but this is a reflection of a climb in 
export prices based on a strong yen and an increase in export 
volume that exceeded the growth in import volume. 
  As discussed in the preceding text, trade indices 
categorized 
by principal regions enable clarification of foreign trade 
trends for each region on a volume basis and provide for an 
analysis of causes in shifts relative to trade surpluses for 
each region. The procedures enable an appraisal of foreign trade 
trends which could not be adequately measured on the basis of 
monetary value trends alone. It is believed that the new index 
is very effective in providing an accurate appraisal for Japan's 
trade with principal regions. 
  Further, aside from the principal regions covered in this 
article, trade indices are published for newly industrializing 
economies of Asia such as South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and 
Singapore.

  [Text] "The bad loan issue has already peaked out. We would 
like to dispose of the issue in another two years." These words 
were spoken by the majority of the banks in announcing earnings 
reports for the year ending in March 1994, but despite thoughts 
of "danger passed and God forgotten," the financial system is 
still plagued by old and new problems that threaten its future. 
  Certainly, in comparison to fiscal year 1992, the total of 
failed loans and extended loans held by 21 city banks, long-term 
trust banks, and trust and banking companies was 13.57 trillion 
yen, which appeared to show a peaking out of such problem loans. 
Sales of loans to the Cooperative Credit Purchasing Co. 
increased significantly, while transfers into the loan 
amortization special accounts which represent an indirect form 
of amortization "were effected to the maximum" along with direct 
amortization, bringing the total value of loans disposed of to 
3.46 trillion yen. 
  The Ministry of Finance [MOF] increased options for early 
disposal of bad loans by authorized special-purpose companies to 
absorb bad loans of affiliated nonbanking institutions. Although 
we can appreciate such strenuous joint government and 
private-sector efforts, the Japanese financial system still 
represents a "Pandora's box." 
  The old problem consists of the aid being extended to the 
housing loan companies, which have a very fragile structure. The 
seven housing loan companies are in the process of undergoing a 
10-year restructuring program, but delays in recovery of asset 
values have caused widening deviations from projections. Since 
fiscal year revenues and profits have failed to grow because its 
share of the home loan business--which is their primary source 
of income--has been diverted to the public Housing Loan 
Corporation, loans extended to the housing loan companies will 
have to undergo decisions on reductions and exemptions of 
liabilities and extension of new loans within a year of the 
initial aid actions. 
  Institutions facing difficult situations include weakly 
structured agricultural cooperative-affiliated financial 
institutions. Whether action is taken to either save or 
liquidate them through the use of public funds which were 
supposedly suspended, the situation is such that the housing 
loan companies, agricultural cooperative-affiliated financial 
institutions and MOF and Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries--which are the supervising agencies--can no longer 
postpone action "by allowing time to idly pass by." 
  The problems are not limited to the housing loan companies. 
There is the risk that hidden bad loans will surface because of 
the failure of businesses whose loans were subject to reduced or 
exempted interest payments. In the last fiscal year, Nippon 
Trust Bank was forced to avoid a recurring loss by using an 
emergency, evasive manipulative action which accounted for an 
indirect amortization action as a special loss rather than as 
other recurring expenses. 
  The new problem is represented in the fact that the Japanese 
financial system has undermined the efficiency of the capital 
distribution function. Amortization of loans through the use of 
undeclared profits in stocks required supporting the stock 
markets through the use of government-created stock valuations. 
As a result, the new issues markets have been distorted by 
restraints on issues at market prices and capital markets have 
been compromised in terms of their capital-raising functions. A 
good example of that situation is that many city banks which are 
awaiting establishment of securities subsidiaries have hesitated 
to issue preferred stock based on a feeling of being constrained 
by the MOF's Securities Bureau. 
  Thus, the financial institutions have regressed to ancient 
systems. Banks rely heavily on indirect financing and securities 
firms are hesitant about the moves toward securitization. If 
direct financing fails to function properly, capital including 
the average business will not be able to take risks. 
  The absence of risk capital caused banks and securities 
firms 
to assume a negative stance saying, "There is no requirement," 
relative to the MOF's Banking Bureau's program for promoting the 
liquidity of bonds. However, banks no longer have the financial 
strength to assume market risks which need to be placed 
somewhere. We believe that structural deficiency is reflected in 
the slow pace of loans referred to as "hesitancy to loan" and 
"hesitancy to borrow," especially as the substance of the 
capital investment recession. 
  The regression to ancient systems on the part of financial 
institutions has delayed the recovery of and undermined the 
Japanese economy. If financial institutions decide to sit back 
and relax in this period of "financial disaffection" until the 
disposal of excessive loan problems, it just may prove that they 
will have failed to take essential, timely actions.

  [Text] Signs of a change for the better have been visible 
recently in the industrial sector, but movements are beginning 
to take place even in the machinery industry that signal a 
change in trends. Indications of a recovery have begun to appear 
in the machine tool industry, and even the construction 
equipment industry has emerged from the long tunnel of recession 
that has lasted since the latter half of 1990. 
  Demand is appearing for industrial robots based on manpower 
conservation projects among small and midsized business 
businesses, and inquiries are increasing in the area of 
computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing 
(CAD/CAM), although the prevailing outlook calls for a 
recessionary trends to continue in the first half of fiscal year 
1994. However, shipbuilding has reached a very critical stage 
and the metal mold industry seems to have hit a double bottom, 
manifesting mixed trends among industries. 
  This article analyzes current conditions and provides a 
projection of trends for each sector within the machinery 
industry. 
  Machine Tools. Director Makoto Umehara, deputy 
chief of the Precision Machinery Operations Department of 
Citizen Watch Company speaks of recent trends by saying, "Since 
entering this year, January was bad, but there was some 
improvement in February and March. Since the beginning of April, 
we have averaged over 10 orders per week, indicating an 
improving trend." 
  The machine tool industry experienced severe recessionary 
conditions in 1993, but an emerging mood of better times has 
been seen recently. A source at a major machine tool maker 
states, "We've seen some modest recovery," in reference to 
price-cutting promotions which had accelerated the drop in new 
orders. The competing makers have arrived at a point where 
financial results will no longer tolerate further price cuts and 
they are taking definite steps to gradually restore sensible 
pricing. 
  Based on past experience that indicates "a recovery in 
prices 
if the economy improves," we might say that recent developments 
serve as evidence that we are undergoing a gradual recovery in 
demand. It appears that domestic appliances will lead the way 
out of the recession. 
  It seems that rising demand for durable consumer goods such 
as amusement systems, video tape recorders, large television 
sets, and white goods is having an impact in the form of 
stepped-up inquiries for machine tools used to fabricate metal 
components. Demand should also come from companies engaged in 
the manufacture of multimedia-related CD-ROM [compact disk, 
read-only memory] drives and optical communication equipment. 
  On the other hand, even in the automotive-related sectors 
where little movement is seen, special sectors have been 
actively placing inquiries. One such sector relates to diesel 
engine makers, where regulations on nitrogen oxide emissions 
will require alteration of engine design, leading to new demand 
for fabricating machinery. 
  Moreover, those companies which in the past called for 
installation of specialized equipment are now being offered 
universal machining centers that are capable of responding to 
rapid changes in requirements related to facilities expansion 
and specifications. Plant operators are not necessarily 
satisfied with old machine tools just because demand for their 
products have risen. 
  Plant operators are endeavoring to convert their operations 
so that they can lower processing and labor costs, while 
producing items with higher added value, multiple features, and 
more precision. Moreover, they are not simply seeking machine 
tools with a high degree of comprehensive capability, but 
machines that are responsive to their real needs. 
  Shipbuilding. Shipbuilding was considered to be a 
comparatively stable industry in the past because the order and 
delivery cycle for the shipbuilding industry extend over a 
two-year period and the effects of economic trends lag in their 
impact on shipbuilding operations. However, vessels ordered in 
fiscal years 1992 and 1993 were priced cheap, causing 
substantial deterioration in profits and causing many major 
shipbuilders to suffer losses. 
  It appears that fiscal years 1994 and 1995 will be a 
critical 
period that will test the ability of shipbuilders to survive. 
The environment for shipbuilders is extremely difficult owing to 
factors such as recessionary conditions, decline in the value of 
ships because of the worldwide recession in marine 
transportation, and a drop in cost competitiveness because of 
the strong yen. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange values 
have a major impact on the shipbuilding industry because of its 
borderless nature. 
  As an example, if the dollar-denominated value of a ship 
falls 10 percent and the value of the yen advances 20 percent, 
the yen-denominated value of the ship drops 30 percent. The 
value of ships has fallen to 60 to 70 percent of their peak. 
Such conditions led to Japan's surrendering to Korea in 1993 the 
title of leading shipbuilding nation of the world. However, 
according to data released on 20 April by the Japan Ship Export 
Association on contracts for ships built for export in fiscal 
year 1993, orders for very large crude carriers (VLCC) with 
capacities in excess of 200,000 tons and container ships were 
received near the end of the fiscal year at a rate 2.8 times 
above the previous fiscal year, reaching a volume of 7,471,018 
gross tons. 
  Export contracts ran at a rate in excess of 7 million gross 
tons between fiscal years 1989 and 1991, but fell substantially 
to 2.67 million gross tons in fiscal year 1992. Contrary to 
expectations, orders for fiscal year 1993 recovered in volume, 
translating into adequate workloads for the various shipbuilders 
for fiscal years 1994 and 1995. 
  Efforts to improve productivity, including purchase of 
materials and equipment from overseas sources on a 
dollar-denominated basis, have narrowed cost differences with 
South Korea and have led to the award of orders. However, the 
question is, will they be able to maintain profitability after 
consideration for the contemplated cost reductions? 
  CAD/CAM Sales of CAD/CAM/computer-aided 
engineering (CAE) systems were not encouraging in fiscal year 
1993 because of reductions in capital spending by industry in 
response to the recession. Demand for peripheral equipment such 
as digitizers, tablets, and plotters was also slow. 
  Most firms expect slow sales during the first half of fiscal 
year 1994, but CAD vendors and plotter makers say "inquiries 
have increased recently." There are also comments that "the rate 
of decline has narrowed compared to the same month of the 
previous year," showing signs of brightening prospects in 
certain sectors. According to industry estimates, the potential 
market for CAD systems including hardware is 500-600 million yen. 
  Sales in fiscal year 1993 dropped about 20 percent from the 
preceding year because of falling hardware prices. However, 
selected CAD vendors have experienced improving order rates 
since the beginning of fiscal year 1994, indicating that a 
recovery is imminent. 
  Kiyadamu Systems of Shinagawa ward, Tokyo, recorded a 
25-percent increase in orders during the January-March quarter 
of 1994 over the same period last year. The company indicates 
increasing replacement of mainframe versions of its CADAM units 
with the micro computer-aided design and manufacturing (CADAM) 
MC/X version of its principal work stations can take credit for 
the improving trends. Vice President Hiroshi Kawaguchi predicts, 
"Results will depend on an economic recovery, but this year 
should not be worse than fiscal year 1993." On the other hand, 
CAE systems sales have been good despite the recession. 
President Masaru Tateishi of Japan Emuesushi asserts, "We can 
maintain a 10 -ercent growth rate for the foreseeable future," 
stressing the significance of underlying demand. 
  The market size for plotters, which are an output device for 
CAD drawings, is one-tenth of the CAD market. Versions selling 
well are limited to low-priced monochrome ink-jet plotters. 
Sales of such plotters also dropped about 25 percent because of 
slow sales and price wars. However, at Muto Industries and 
Graphitech where operating results had fallen, hope is being 
placed on signs of a "real" recovery as expressed in the words, 
"each month was recording results below those of the prior year, 
but beginning in November 1993 the rate of decline had narrowed." 
  Makers of input devices known as digitizers and tablets 
which 
were previously sold mainly to CAD systems makers have begun to 
actively seek orders for tablets designed for the computer 
graphics markets to offset weakness in the CAD systems area. 
  Robotics. "Normally, orders drop in April as a 
reaction to the closing of financial accounts at the end of 
March, but this year orders were stronger in April than in 
March," said the individual in charge of sales at DAIHEN Corp., 
a welding robot manufacturer. Similarly, President Mikio Yamada 
of Nejitake Seiko of Kofu city comments, "February signaled a 
bottoming out, and we have seen some improvement since March. It 
appears that small and midsized businesses, which could no 
longer delay manpower-saving actions, have finally begun to take 
action on the capital investment front." Manufacture of robots 
in fiscal year 1992 fell sharply by 30 percent from the previous 
year to 427.5 billion yen. 
  Figures have not been compiled for fiscal year 1993, but it 
appears that a decline of about 400 billion yen cannot be 
avoided. In addition to the recession following the bursting of 
the bubble, the early spring rise in the value of the yen nipped 
the budding recovery and adversely affected the capital 
investment will of the automobile and electric machinery 
industries. However, recently, unprecedented changes have begun 
to appear in the capital investment stance of various 
manufacturers. Semiconductor and liquid crystal device makers 
have sharply increased spending on plant expansions, and the 
outlook is favorable for the home building and food 
manufacturing sectors. Further, strong demand persists for 
manpower-conserving versions of equipment used in sectors 
involving 3-K [kitanai, kiken, kitsui--dirty, 
dangerous, and difficult] operations. 
  New types of products offered at the "International 
Industrial Robotics Fair" held at the Tokyo International 
Exhibition Hall, Harumi, Tokyo, in November 1993 included 
Yasukawa Electric Manufacturing Company's dustproof, waterproof 
"SV-16" and FANUC Ltd.'s "LR-Mate 100, which was priced under 2 
million yen." 
  Further, Mitsubishi Electric and Sankyo Seiki Manufacturing 
are moving aggressively into the robotics business for 
clean-room operations. Activities of this nature portend a 
gradual recovery for most robot makers in 1994, although not to 
the level that prevailed during the peak a few years ago. 
Moreover, a full-scale recovery is dependent on a return to 
better times for the automotive and home appliance industries. 
  Although future and underlying potential exists for robots 
designed for new applications, they are unable to contribute 
greatly to near-term industry recovery, and their small 
quantities pose a cost burden. Strong hope is still tied to the 
automotive and domestic appliance sectors. The U.S. automotive 
sector recovered before Japan's, and the operating results of 
Japanese robotics firms whose U.S.-bound shipments are larger 
than domestic shipments, such as Fujikoshi and FANUC, have 
already begun to improve. 
  It appears that the key to the future will be sales targeted 
at the United States, a recovery in the automotive and domestic 
appliance industries and the exploitation of new applications. 
  Metal Molds. The principal users of metal molds 
such as the automotive and domestic appliance industries 
experienced limited improvements in sales since entering 1994, 
but such changes have not affected the metal molding industry, 
and many industry sources say that "the slow sales trends will 
continue at least until summer." 
  According to Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
machinery statistics, metal mold production including in-house 
production totaled 32.456 billion yen in January 1994, 19.8 
percent below the prior year, and in February totaled 30.623 
billion yen, 13.5 percent below the prior year, showing no sign 
of recovery. 
  In 1991, industry-wide production of metal molds totaled 
544.069 billion yen, a historical peak, but a sharp decline in 
demand by major users such as automotive and domestic appliance 
makers resulted in a 19.2-percent drop in production in 1992. 
  Production in 1993 fell only 0.5 percent, making it appear 
as 
if an improvement were taking place, but production resumed 
double-digit declines in 1994, giving the appearance of a double 
bottom. 
  During the same period, major users of metal molds such as 
the automotive and domestic appliance industries aggressively 
implemented widespread restructuring, including improvements in 
production procedures, standardization of parts, and 
simplification of product design. Such trends had a decisive 
impact on demand for metal molds, the need for which depends 
greatly on the variety of designs and parts involved in the 
manufacture of end products. 
  Even now, when signs of an economic recovery are visible, 
production simplification projects of this nature continue in 
the automotive and domestic appliance industries and industry 
sources say they "will continue into the future." 
  As a result, although an economic recovery is underway, the 
same industry sources say that "a sharp recovery in the metal 
molding industry as a whole is not expected." The metal molding 
industry faces the urgent need to explore ways to survive. 
  The eastern chapter of the Japan Metal Molding Industry 
Society has applied for a subsidy for the Tokyo-sponsored Local 
Industry Structural Enhancement Project which in fiscal 1993 
worked on concepts in support of the project and is actively 
engaged in the preparation of future concepts envisioning 
globalization. 
  It appears that Japan's metal molding industry, which has 
reached a turning point, is about to launch strategies aimed at 
globalization. 
  Construction Equipment. Domestic demand for 
construction equipment is undergoing a full-scale recovery. 
Orders for hydraulic shovels which are a leading indicator for 
construction equipment orders, increased in January for the 
first time in four months and rose more than 10 percent in 
February and March. 
  As a result, the view is spreading as indicated by 
Catepillar-Mitsubishi Managing Director Mikio Takeuchi that, "In 
fiscal year 1993, demand for hydraulic shovels increased less 
than 1 percent in volume, slightly exceeding the prior fiscal 
year, showing definite signs of a recovery for construction 
equipment." Although construction equipment demand has been slow 
since the latter half of 1990, these signs indicate better times 
ahead. 
  In the March-May 1993 quarter, orders for hydraulic shovels 
increased and expectations for a recovery rose, then declined 
after the general contractor scandals and the long rainy season. 
Such experience has caused the manufacturers to become cautious, 
but Ryuichi Tokunaga, head of the Japan Construction Equipment 
Industry Association Operations Department, comments, "This 
recovery cycle appears to be solid in that equipment-leasing 
companies which had been cautious are increasing their orders." 
  Further, orders for mini-shovels, which had declined 
continuously since June 1991, rose 6.9 percent in January 1994 
over the same month in the prior year for the first time in 32 
months, serving as evidence of a "full-scale recovery." 
  Komatsu Construction Equipment Sales Director Shigetoshi 
Kumihashi provides a background analysis of the above 
developments as he says, "Newly initiated public works projects 
have increased recently. Utilization rates of rental equipment 
are up and project backlogs as of the end of fiscal year 1993 
are higher than they were at the end of the prior year." 
  Orders for bulldozers and wheel loaders have not recovered 
as 
much as for hydraulic shovels, but the rate of decline narrowed 
from the double-digit drops in the first half of fiscal year 
1993 to a drop of about 3 percent in the period since the autumn 
of last year.

  [Text] Mazda published their April production and sales 
status on 25 May. For 19 consecutive months, both its production 
and domestic sales have fallen below the results for the 
previous year, and it continues to break its worst record of the 
past. In production, however, although passenger cars fell mroe 
than 20 percent compared to the same month of the previous year, 
commercial vehicles had only a slight decrease. Some brightness 
could be seen in domestic sales also, for example, light autos 
were on par with the previous year for the first time in eight 
months. 
  The number of cars produced was 59,189, a 20.1-percent 
decrease compared to the same month of the previous year. The 
drop in passenger cars was especially great at 47,320, a 
23.8-percent decrease. On the other hand, there was no more than 
a slight decrease for commercial vehicles at 11,869, a 
1.1-percent decrease for the period. 
  By vehicle class, the major vehicle classes decreased across 
the board, but in commercial vehicles, the "B series" pickup 
truck, which had a large order from the Middle East, increased 
by 21.7 percent compared to the same month of the previous year, 
and the Bongo series registered a 2.6-percent increase for the 
same period. 
  The number of cars in domestic sales was 32,523, a decrease 
of 9.5 percent compared to the same month of the previous year. 
Within this, light cars combining commercial vehicles and 
passenger cars were 5,137, a 1-car increase from the same month 
of the previous year. Moreover, exports were 43,177, a 
20.4-percent decrease for same, falling below the mark for the 
previous year for 13 consecutive months.

  [Text] Mazda revealed a new restructuring policy on 27 May. 
Considering that hiring of university graduates in the spring of 
1995 and 1996 will in principle be zero, it will accelerate 
personnel reductions and condense fixed costs. Along with making 
a 30-percent reduction by gradually reorganizing existing 
vehicle classes with full model changes implemented in the 
future, Mazda will increase the ratio of shared parts with old 
models to over 50 percent, and proceed with large-scale cost 
reductions. Making these take root, it will turn to an ordinary 
surplus in fiscal 1995, and thereafter, it is prepared to aim at 
"a management constitution capable of paying dividends even with 
a 70-percent operation" (Vice President Makoto Miyaji). 
  For the new-graduate hiring program, it had worked out zero 
university graduate hiring in the spring of 1995, but the policy 
is to continue this in the spring of 1996 also. In the plan to 
reduce employees from 30,000 to 27,000 in the three-year period 
from 1993 to 1995, no more than a total of 60 university 
graduate BA's and BS's were hired this spring. Zero hiring for 
two consecutive years is unusual, even in the auto industry. 
  To decrease the cost of vehicles, it is promoting in the 
mid- 
to long-term 1) a 30-percent reorganization of existing car 
classes (26 classes), 2) 30-percent reduction in platforms (17 
types) which are the basic frame of the vehicle, and 3) making 
the parts diversion from old models to new models over 50 
percent. In particular, it will review existing methods from the 
vehicle planning stage and have drastic cost goals, with the 
idea to "aim at a profit improvement of 10 percent more than for 
existing cars." 
  Regarding reorganization of sales channels, which has become 
an urgent task, it will maintain the present five-channel 
system, but improve earnings by reorganization of stores in 
important sales regions and expanding the "combined sales 
system" of selling the same car classes in several channels. 
  Regarding their relationship with Ford Motor of the United 
States, it considers it "an important key supporting business in 
the mid- to long-term" and is studying joint development, 
reciprocal adaptability of parts, and joint enterprises overseas. 
  Furthermore, in the short term, at the same time as 
proceeding with a move up in cost decreases such as VA (value 
analysis) and VE (value engineering) activities, it will hold 
the amount of facilities investment for the time being to under 
50 billion yen a year. The policy also is to expand the 
reduction scale for the personnel reduction of 3,000 people in 
the plan by rationalization of plants. 
  The goal is to have a constitution which can pay dividends 
even with 70-percent operation (production capability of 1.1 
million cars per year) in the next three to four years.

  [Text] Ford Motor of the United States will jointly develop 
a small world strategy car with Mazda with whom it has a capital 
tie-up. First, it will begin development with the Mazda 
main-force "Familia" car class as the base and produce it with 
the three poles of Japan, the United States, and Europe 
beginning in 1998 or 1999. The Familia is a mass-sales car 
amounting to about 700,000 cars annually in Asia and North 
America combined, with the cars sold by Ford. It appears that 
the plan is to combine this with the same "Escort" car class of 
Ford Europe, and the idea is for both companies jointly to 
gather momentum in international strategy by expanding 
production scale further and cutting development costs. 
  Besides the Familia, a strong candidate for "world strategy 
car" where the same model will be sold throughout the world is 
the "Festiva" that is being designed centering on Mazda. 
Considering that it "would like to promote development of world 
strategy cars in a wide class of cars" (Mazda chief executive), 
it is possible that it will in the future include midsized cars 
and above, which are the forte of Ford. The outline will be 
firmed up in June and it is scheduled to develop side by side 
various class cars beginning at the end of the year. 
  Both Ford and Mazda will position the "Familia," the next 
after next after the current model that will be put on the 
market in 1998 or 1999, as a world strategy car, Ford will 
produce it in the United States and Europe and prospects are 
that they also will export it. Mazda will center on production 
and sales in Japan. Besides being able to share development 
expenses with Ford, Mazda can also expect the supply of parts to 
Ford. 
  Ford is promoting unification of its U.S. and European 
organization and consolidation of car classes. The over 2,000-cc 
"Mondeo" which Ford Europe handles is considered a world 
strategy car. It is already on sale in Europe and production 
will begin in summer in the U.S. market also. It is aiming at 
annual production of 800,000 cars. 
  However, there remains an overlapping of car classes by the 
various Ford-related companies in the United States, Europe, and 
Japan, and they are cultivating the next-generation car with a 
"Familia" base as a world strategy car in the 1500-cc class by 
U.S. and Japanese cooperation.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Key to Pyongyang"] </F>
  [Text] Hans Blix, head of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA), has a North Korean task no other would envy. 
When he informed the Security Council that Pyongyang had denied 
his inspectors access to two nuclear waste sites earmarked for 
investigation, he raised a vexing question: what should be the 
response of the international community in this dangerous case? 
  The North Korean regime is in violation of the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Failure to punish it for doing 
so would leave in tatters the credibility of both the NPT and 
the IAEA. It would send a comforting message to every 
panjandrum in every "rogue" state: violate international law 
with impunity, for the Security Council may not care what you 
do. Were it not for local injunctions against champagne, the 
corks would be popping from Baghdad to Tripoli. 
  Sharp United Nations sanctions against North Korea, provided 
under the NPT and imposed in the interests of global public 
order, would appear to be a possible next step. Yet the 
apparent logic of sanctions is here hostage to reality. It is 
unlikely that China would favour such a move. If the matter 
were put to a vote now--and to do so would be impolitic- -a 
Chinese veto would give North Korea s "Great Leader" Kim Il Sung 
an undeserved propaganda gift. 
  If the matter were addressed outside the aegis of the 
Security Council, in order to circumnavigate the dragon of 
China's veto, there would be an equally unsatisfactory outcome. 
North Korea lives off Beijing's supplies of oil and food; and 
barter across the porous border with China, between ethnic 
Koreans on either side, is economic scaffolding for the regime 
in Pyongyang. 
  Even if sanctions bite, they will not "draw blood' if 
relations with China are unaffected. This will be so, even with 
Japan's presence in any critical coalition. Tokyo can choke at 
source the remittances sent by its own ethnic Koreans to 
relatives in North Korea, believed to amount to $600 million 
annually. This infusion is crucial to Pyongyang's sickly 
economy, and some estimates put the figure at nearly $2 billion. 
But important sections of the Japanese political establishment 
continue to balk at the prospect, perceiving it to be 
"counter-productive". 
  Moreover, the key to the resolution of the crisis lies not 
in 
New York, nor Washington, nor Tokyo, but in Beijing. If the 
impasse is to be ended, President Clinton must direct his 
diplomatic energy at China. He must proceed subtly: while 
impressing on Beijing the significance of Americas recent 
renewal of China's most favoured nation status, he must not 
approach the matter as a debt-collector would. American 
diplomacy must, instead, stress the obvious: that an end to the 
nuclear crisis is as much in China's interest as it is in 
America's. 
  Beijing has nothing to gain, and much to lose, from a Korean 
peninsula in a state of nuclear instability. Will the economic 
climate in the region be improved by crisis? Is it in Beijing's 
interest to provoke a renewed arms race in the region, centred 
mainly in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan -- all major investors 
in the Chinese economy? Can Beijing afford to continue its 
munificence, with cheap oil and free food, to a regime which 
earns for its benefactor no international good will? Mr Clinton 
must demonstrate to China that the answer to all these questions 
is "no". Only then can the Security Council, in wisdom and in 
logic, proceed to sanctions against North Korea.

<F P=106> [Summary of interview with ROK Deputy Prime Minister Yi </F>
Hong-ku by unidentified ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter on 9 June; place 
not given; first paragraph is introduction] 
  [Text] The following is a summary of remarks by Yi Hong-ku, 
ROK deputy prime minister and National Unification Board 
director, in an ASAHI SHIMBUN interview on 9 June. 
  1. It appears there were two possible reasons for North 
Korea proceeding with the replacement of fuel rods in its 
nuclear facilities on the eve of the third round of high-level 
negotiations with the United States. 
  One was the fact that some quarters in the United States and 
in the international community said they could tolerate North 
Korea's past nuclear-related attempts if it fully returns to the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and guarantees it will 
not extract plutonium from the replaced fuel rods. North Korea 
probably thought it was worth finding out if they really meant 
it. 
  Another reason was, judging from the mood in the United 
States and the international community, North Korea thought it 
unlikely they would react strongly to fuel rod replacement. 
That was probably a gamble, but it ended up as a miscalculation. 
  2. Concerning possible sanctions against North Korea, the 
ROK Government has a three-point principle -- sanctions should 
be implemented 1) effectively, 2) swiftly, and 3) on a 
step-by-step basis. Our stance is that, while measures should 
be strengthened gradually, there would always be room for 
negotiation. 
  3. Generally speaking, sanctions can be classified in three 
steps -- "limited sanctions," "further sanctions," and "heavy 
sanctions (like sea blockade)." The latter may bring about 
excessive tension in the region. Since bans on oil, food 
exports, and remittances are unlikely to trigger military 
conflicts, these should be incorporated in the first or second 
stages. 
  4. We are seeking a UN Security Council [UNSC] resolution on 
the sanctions as early as next week. Even in the worst case, 
the resolution should be adopted within three to four weeks. 
The United States is in accord with us on this point. 
  5. While we have an option of three-party sanctions by 
Japan, the ROK, and the United States, if China opposes UNSC 
sanctions we must focus on discussions in the UNSC for the time 
being. The objective of the trilateral talks is to clearly show 
the grave concern of the three nations and not let North Korea 
get any wrong idea that the UNSC is the only obstacle to 
overcome. 
  6. China has great influence on North Korea since it 
supplies 75 percent of North Korea's oil needs. China does not 
want any nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula, and, to 
achieve this objective, we hope China will take considerable 
positive action on the issue. 
  7. It is my understanding that Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's proposal for an eight-party conference (of the United 
Nations and nations concerned) is not a prerequisite for 
Russia's approval of UN sanctions. We take the stance that the 
eight-party conference cannot replace the sanctions bill already 
under debate in the international community. 
  8. Even if North Korea formally proposes bilateral talks 
with the ROK, we would not agree. Since the issue is currently 
under debate at the UNSC, such an offer confuses the focal point 
of the problem. 
  9. At the end of 1991, the North and South signed a joint 
non-nuclear declaration, and this is an absolute promise between 
the two Korean nations. The ROK declared its policy not to 
develop technology for reprocessing of nuclear fuel to encourage 
North Korea to remain in the bilateral framework instead of 
embracing nuclear weapons development. However, the non-nuclear 
declaration would lose its effect if North Korea obtains 
plutonium through reprocessing. 
  10. In explanation of the ROK policy to stick to the 
non-nuclear declaration, we have been telling the public that 
reprocessing of nuclear fuel can be regarded as an attempt to 
develop nuclear weapons. If North Korea breaks the declaration, 
we would no longer have justification for staying away from 
reprocessing technology. In that case, we would have to take 
some action. If we fail in removing concern over nuclear 
warfare from the Korean Peninsula, that would endanger the 
entire Northeast Asia in the 21st Century. 
  11. Some quarters in the ROK insist the non-nuclear 
declaration should be abolished to promote the ROK's own nuclear 
energy policies. Those people are questioning why we have to 
drop nuclear reprocessing while Japan is doing it for peaceful 
purposes. To my surprise, most National Assembly members of 
both the ruling and opposition parties believe this, so there is 
the possibility of future adoption of active nuclear energy 
policies in the ROK. 
  12. At present, North Korea is taking no major military 
actions to provoke us. However, the Korean situation is often 
affected by political and psychological factors. The ROK 
citizens are working hard to strengthen the nation's competitive 
power in the international market by pursuing democratic 
politics and a modernized economy. For such people, war is the 
very last choice. North Korea is taking our antiwar sentiment 
hostage.

  [Text] Vienna, June 7 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) will convene a regular Board of Governors' 
meeting Tuesday [7 June] for the second consecutive day to 
continue discussion of the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Nuclear safeguards measures, the key point of the issue, 
will 
come under intensive discussion by the board members following a 
separate report by IAEA Director-General Hans Blix. 
  Major board members such as the United States, Japan, 
Australia, Canada, France and Russia are likely to hold a 
separate meeting Tuesday morning to reaffirm their joint stance 
on pushing for the board's adoption of a resolution. 
  But the issue will probably take a clearer shape at the next 
meeting slated for Thursday or Friday, when the member countries 
adjust their positions after observing developments in the 
United Nations Security Council and North Korea. 
  The board's discussion will be based on Blix's report 
pointing out that North Korea's unsupervised refueling of its 
5-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon and the damage to later 
measurement of the discharged fuel rods is a grave violation of 
the nuclear safeguards agreement. The board members are likely 
to urge North Korea to accept additional IAEA surveillance of 
two undeclared sites suspected of being nuclear waste dumps in 
Yongbyon. 
  Blix is expected to report that the IAEA cannot ascertain 
how 
much plutonium North Korea possesses because of its unsupervised 
replacement of fuel rods in the reactor and, consequently, is 
unable to accomplish its purpose of ensuring nuclear safeguards. 
  Blix's report, which has been obtained beforehand, 
emphasized 
that North Korean cooperation would allow the IAEA to secure 
lost information, pointing out that inspection of the undeclared 
nuclear facilities at Yongbyon was vital. 
  In light of some board members' feeling that the IAEA's 
strong position on North Korea should be addressed, some form of 
resolution will likely be brought up at the meeting Tuesday 
afternoon or Wednesday morning.

  [Text] Vienna, June 8 (YONHAP) -- North Korea reaffirmed 
Tuesday that the dispute over its nuclear program can be settled 
only through dialogue with the United States, clarifying that it 
will not accept an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
resolution calling for special nuclear inspections in North 
Korea. 
  The chief North Korean delegate to the IAEA, Yun Ho-chin, 
who 
is attending an IAEA Board of Governors' meeting, held a press 
conference to warn that his country may withdraw from the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). 
  Yun said, "If the IAEA adopts a resolution again, it will be 
as much as telling us to leave the NPT system." 
  He then criticized the IAEA, claiming it is manipulated by 
powerful nations and has distorted the technical problems 
related to replacement of fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in 
Yongbyon in order to pressure North Korea. 
  North Korea has already proved through experiments that it 
is 
possible to recount the history of the reactor operations, Yun 
said. 
  Pyongyang notified the IAEA of the technical point at issue 
in an earlier letter, but the U.N. watchdog agency is ignoring 
the notification, he added. 
  North Korea sent a message to Hans Blix, director-general of 
the IAEA, on Monday saying it would quit the NPT if it came 
under U.N. pressure over its suspected drive to develop nuclear 
weapons. 
  The message, signed by Pak Yong-nam, general-director of the 
General Department of Atomic Energy, warned that if the IAEA 
took the North Korean nuclear issue to the U.N. Security Council 
and continued to resort to pressure, Pyongyang would no longer 
feel the need to subject itself to the "unreasonable binds" of 
the NPT. 
  Meanwhile, the IAEA Board of Governors met for a second day 
Tuesday to discuss nuclear safeguards. Delegates from the 
United States, Japan, Australia and Canada are likely to draw up 
a draft resolution Wednesday urging Pyongyang to accept special 
inspections, according to a diplomatic source here.

  [Text] Seoul, June 10 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
warned North Korea Friday that its suspected nuclear arms 
program would result in "a grave mistake of inviting 
self-destruction." 
  Speaking at the opening ceremony for the War Memorial Hall 
in 
Yongsan, Kim, noting the Russian documents on the Korean war he 
received from President Boris Yeltsin during his recent visit to 
Moscow reveal how North Korea started the war by invading the 
South, said the North is again seeking to commit war crimes by 
developing nuclear arms. To avoid this scenario, it must repent 
for what it did 40 years ago and apologize to the nation for its 
criminal acts. 
  Deploring that some South Korean youths still believe and 
follow the old dogma of communism shunned by the entire world, 
he expressed hope that the war memorial hall would serve as a 
training ground for the people, especially the rising 
generation, to learn the pain and suffering of war. 
  A people who never forget war will enjoy peace, he stressed, 
urging his countrymen to protect freedom and peace. 
  Attending the ceremony were Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, 
Seoul Mayor Yi Won-chong, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. 
Yi Yang-ho, U.S. Forces Korea Commander Gen. Gary Luck and many 
other dignitaries. 
  Completed in three years and seven months, the six-story war 
memorial hall, including two basement floors, is situated on an 
area of 35,000 pyong (one pyong is about 3.3 square meters) on 
the old site of the Army headquarters in front of the Defense 
Ministry building. 
  Displayed in six showrooms in the building are some 7,800 
war 
items collected from many countries. In addition, over 110 
Korean war items, including the South Korean Air Force's T-6 
training plane, the North Korean Army's T-34 tank and a U.S. Air 
Force B-52 bomber, are on display. 
  The hall is open from 9:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays, 
starting Tuesday. Admission fees are 2,000 won for adults, 
1,500 won for secondary school students and 1,000 for elementary 
school pupils.

<F P=106> [Article by An Hui-chang] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Ministry of Public Security of North Korea 
is compared to our Headquarters of National Police. However, 
while our Headquarters of National Police is under the Ministry 
of Home Affairs, North Korea's Ministry of Public Security is 
under the State Administration Council, and, accordingly, its 
position can be said to be at a higher level than our police 
headquarters. Its power is stronger than that of our police, as 
well. 
  Yo Man-chol, former North Korean public security officer, 
captain, who defected to the ROK recently, stated: Public 
security officers' prestige is so big that their power is 
"sacred and inviolable." When I was a public security officer, I 
lived with the sense of a self-confidence that no one dared to 
attack me. 
  The role of the Ministry of Public Security may be evidence 
that can ascertain the remarks stated above by Mr. Yo Man-chol 
to be true. 
  The major duties of the Ministry of Public Security include 
preventing and handling crimes and accidents, conducting 
security guard activities for Kim Il-song and other high-ranking 
figures, conducting surveillance on foreigners, ferreting out 
antistate elements, and so forth. [passage omitted] 
  How are public security officers appointed? The difference 
from our way of appointment is that public security officers are 
not appointed through an examination system, but through a 
recommendation system. According to Mr. Yo Man-chol, cadre 
officers in charge of recruiting public security officers at 
city or county public security offices go around their 
respective responsible district. There, they receive from people 
in the district a list of candidates recommended by them or they 
directly select candidates. Then, they select final candidates 
after screening their family background and personal ability. 
Priority is given to those candidates with good family 
background and quick-judgment ability. However, in many cases, 
public security officers are recruited through the 
recommendation of high-ranking party and government officials. 
  Mr. Yon stated that he was the driver of a political officer 
in a brigade of the Korean People's Army and that he became a 
public security officer thanks to this political officer's 
recommendation. [passage omitted] 
  One of the important tasks of public security officers is 
security guard activities for high-ranking officials and for Kim 
Il-song, in particular. Mr. Yo reveals that when Kim Il-song 
comes to Hamhung city for an on-the-spot guidance or on leave, 
all public security officers in South Hamgyong Province are 
placed under a state of alert. 
  According to Mr. Yo, when Kim Il-song visits Hamhung city, 
the South Hamgyong provincial public security department 
receives Kim's itinerary from the General Security Bureau [howi 
chongguk] in Pyongyang and issues an emergency codenamed "Storm 
One" 40 minutes before Kim arrives at the Hamhung railway 
station. Such a short notice is also to keep Kim's visit secret. 
  Once an emergency is issued, security officers from various 
districts in the city are to gather at the provincial public 
security department building where they receive orders on 
deployment. They are to be deployed at various guard posts in 
the city, including the Hamhung railway station. In the case of 
security activities on the streets, public security officers are 
to be deployed 50 meters from each other. 
  When Kim Il-song arrives at the Hamhung railway station, 
public security officers are to be deployed on the street 
leading the place where Kim is to stay 25 meters from each other. 
  As to the level of North Korea's security guard, Mr. Yo 
said: 
Public security members are to take charge of outside security, 
and security guard members from the General Security Bureau are 
in charge of internal security. Security guard members from the 
General Security Bureau establish three and four security rings 
around Kim Il-song. I once heard a security guard member from 
the General Security Bureau in Pyongyang saying that security 
rings are so tight that not even an ant can penetrate into the 
security rings.

  [Text] Seoul, June 10 (YONHAP) -- North Korea recorded 
negative economic growth for the fourth consecutive year in 
1993, a Bank of Korea (BOK) report said Friday. 
  The report, titled "The Estimated Gross National Product 
(GNP) of North Korea in 1993," presumed that the North's GNP 
last year fell to 20.5 billion dollars from the previous year's 
21.1 billion dollars. 
  The BOK report put North Korea's estimated economic growth 
rate at minus 4.3 percent last year compared with the previous 
year. Its estimated economic growth rates were minus 3.7 
percent in 1990, minus 5.2 percent in 1991 and minus 7.6 percent 
in 1992. 
  North Korea's per capita GNP fell to 904 dollars last year 
from 943 dollars in 1992 while total foreign trade nosedived to 
2.64 billion dollars last year from 4.8 billion dollars in 1989, 
a 55-percent decrease over four years, according to the report. 
  In contrast, South Korea's GNP was 328.7 billion dollars 
last 
year, 16 times that of North Korea, and the South's per capita 
GNP came to 7,466 dollars, 8.3 times that of the North. 
  The North's total trade volume of 2.64 billion dollars last 
year, 1.02 billion dollars in exports and 1.62 billion dollars 
in imports, was a mere 1.6 percent of the South's 166.04 billion 
dollars in trading volume. 
  North Korea spent 5,620 million dollars on building up its 
military last year while the South spent 11.92 billion dollars. 
  North Korea posted minus 9.7 percent economic growth in the 
construction sector last year, minus 8.7 percent in electricity, 
gas and tap water, minus 7.6 percent in agro-fisheries, minus 
7.2 percent in mining and minus 4.2 percent in heavy industries. 
  The North's light and service industries, however, showed 
5.0 
percent and 1.2 percent growth rates, respectively.

  [Text] Seoul, June 10 (YONHAP) -- The political tension 
caused by the North Korean nuclear problem has had little effect 
on inter-Korean commodity exchanges or trade with other nations, 
business sources here said Friday. 
  Interest rates for spot financing, however, are on the rise. 
  Sources at trading companies said that inter-Korean trade 
including processing-on-commission dealings is going on as usual. 
  Businesses which deal with North Korea said they will watch 
how the situation develops before placing new orders with the 
North, adding this does not mean they would suspend 
processing-on-commission dealings with the North. 
  A source at Hyundai Business Group said Hyundai is 
purchasing 
zinc ingots without any interruption and that the nuclear 
dispute is not harming trade with other countries. But he said 
interest rates for long-term spot financing by overseas branches 
and locally incorporated firms of Korean businesses are rising 
slightly. 
  Other sources said they believe there will be little change 
in South Korean trade with the North and other countries before 
international sanctions against Pyongyang are actually adopted.

  [Text] North-South processing-on-commission trade 
increased in the first quarter of this year despite the fact 
that North-South tensions have escalated due to the North Korean 
nuclear issue. The North and South exchanged goods worth $6.952 
million during this period, 7.5 times the amount in the same 
period last year. 
  This accounts for 90.7 percent of the amount of North-South 
processing-on-commission trade of all of last year ($7.657 
million). 
  During this period, we brought in North Korean goods worth 
$4.122 million, 7.7 times the amount of the same period of last 
year. The goods included jackets, trousers, and shirts for men 
and women.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 5 (YONHAP) -- Western banks obliged to 
report to the Bank of International Settlements increased their 
credit to North Korea 45 million U.S. dollars to 492 million 
dollars last year, the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reported Sunday. 
  The Japanese-language economic newspaper said the reason of 
the Western banks' increased credit to North Korea last year in 
spite of the heightened tension over the Stalinist state's 
nuclear standoff was not known, citing an international 
financial market source. 
  Western credit to North Korea was on the decline between 
1990 
and 1992. 
  Japanese banks' loans to North Korea have leveled off at 
about five percent of the Western banks' credit over the years, 
the source was quoted as saying. 
  The EUROMONEY magazine published in England put North Korea 
at the 157th place in the country-risk ranking in its March 
issue last year. 
  The Western banks' increased credit to North Korea last year 
in spite of such a high country risk may be attributed to 
increased trade between North Korea and Western nations on a 
short-term credit basis, the newspaper said.

  [Text] Beijing, June 10 (YONHAP) -- The Czech Republic has 
recently withdrawn its embassy in Pyongyang, a Western source 
here said on Friday. 
  "Following their withdrawal from the neutral nations 
supervisory commission in Korea a while ago, the Czech Republic 
has recently closed down its embassy in Pyongyang for a reason 
not formally known," the source said. 
  He said a Western firm is now negotiating with North Korea 
for the lease of the 14-room Czech Embassy building. 
  It appears, the source said, that Czech had closed down its 
embassy in North Korea in the belief that it is not economically 
or diplomatically advantageous to keep their embassy there. 
  Cuba, too, is said to have withdrawn its embassy from 
Pyongyang, but this has not been confirmed, the source added.

  [Text] Seoul, June 10 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
reconfirmed his policy of close cooperation with the United 
States in handling the North Korean nuclear issue and explained 
the results of his recent trip to Russia and Uzbekistan in a 
telephone conversation with President Bill Clinton Friday 
morning. 
  In the hour-long call placed by Kim at 11:08 A.M., the two 
presidents agreed that U.N. Security Council sanctions hold the 
key to settling the nuclear row with North Korea and that they 
would seek sanctions through cooperation among Korea, the United 
States and Japan, presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik said. 
  Clinton promised to see to it that the Security Council 
refrains from taking steps opposed by South Korea, saying what 
is most important for North Korea now is to alter its stance 
toward atomic power development. 
  On former President Jimmy Carter's plan to visit North 
Korea, 
the incumbent American president said Carter would be going to 
Pyongyang as a private individual having nothing to do with him 
or the U.S. Government. 
  Carter will not carry any U.S. Government messages to 
Pyongyang, Clinton said, stressing that his support for U.N. 
Security Council sanctions against North Korea would not swerve 
even if Carter brought back a message from Pyongyang. 
  When he meets Kim Il-song in Pyongyang, the former president 
will explain the feelings and concerns of the international 
community about North Korea's nuclear development program. 
  Kim, explaining the outcome of his Russian trip including 
Russia's decision to suspend arms sales to Pyongyang, kill the 
Pyongyang-Moscow mutual assistance pact and hand over Russian 
documents on the Korean war, said the Kremlin appeared to have 
made a decisive change in its policy toward North Korea. 
  Kim and Clinton also exchanged views on China's position on 
Security Council sanctions against North Korea, while agreeing 
to hold another telephone talk on the nuclear issue. 
  On June 3 when Clinton was touring Europe, he phoned Kim in 
Moscow to discuss joint measures the two countries should take 
on the nuclear standoff. 
  Before his departure for Moscow on June 1, Kim called up 
Clinton to discuss the same issue.

  [Text] Seoul, June 10 (YONHAP) -- The reactions of South 
Korea's ruling and opposition political parties to Jimmy 
Carter's planned visit to North Korea are contrasting. 
  The main opposition Democratic Party (DP) and its former 
chairman Kim Tae-chung welcomed the visit by the former U.S. 
President, noting that it was first proposed by former party 
leader Kim Tae- chung himself. 
  The DP said it hoped that Carter could help find a 
breakthrough in the nuclear deadlock. 
  The ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), however, sounded 
a 
note of caution, saying the visit could throw the issue into 
confusion as the United States and its allies are working to 
impose U.N. economic sanctions on North Korea. 
  When the news of Carter's planned trip reached Seoul, Kim 
Tae- chung was said to have expressed "unreserved welcome." 
  "It really is good," Kim Tae-chung was quoted by his aides 
as 
having said. "Let's hope that the North Korean nuclear issue 
could be resolved through this occasion." 
  The Kim Tae-chung Peace Foundation for the Asia and Pacific 
Region said it hoped that Carter's trip would provide an 
opportunity to resolve the mounting tension on the Korean 
peninsula over the nuclear row. 
  The visit will help to maintain nuclear transparency and 
normalize relations between the United States and North Korea in 
a package deal, the foundation said. 
  Noting that U.N. inspection of a key radiochemical 
laboratory at Yongbyon was realized following a visit to 
Pyongyang by American evangelist Billy Graham, the foundation 
said it hoped for progress in negotiations on settling the 
nuclear issue. 
  The ruling party said Carter's visit in effect means a 
reopening of negotiations and expressed concern that it could 
muddy the current situation as the international community makes 
a concerted effort to secure nuclear transparency in North Korea. 
  In particular, the Carter visit could work unexpectedly 
against the move in the U.N. Security Council to slap Pyongyang 
with economic sanctions. 
  Some DLP officials privately said "it is laughable" for 
members of the opposition party "to rejoice unreservedly," 
claiming Carter's visit proves "the excellent and far-sighted 
opinion of Chairman Kim Tae-chung." 
  Rep. No Chae-pong said, "We all know that the Kim Tae-chung 
side had been in contact with Carter in the past. 
  "What I don't understand is that they (Democratic Party) are 
trying to use the national security problem as a domestic 
political issue." 
  Another DLP lawmaker pointed out that Carter had planned to 
withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea and had been laughed at 
for his naivete. "Unless he discarded his fixed ideas of the 
past, he could only be an obstacle to South Korea's efforts to 
resolve inter- Korean questions through dialogue," he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Son Chae-kyu] </F>
  [Text] Washington, June 9 (YONHAP) -- Although Jimmy Carter 
has taken pains to stress that he will be visiting North Korea 
in a private capacity, the former U.S. President's trip is 
drawing keen interest as it could lead to a breakthrough in the 
nuclear impasse. 
  In announcing his planned visit to Korea, Carter made no 
mention of the nuclear dispute. But it was obvious he intends 
to take up the question with North Korean President Kim Il-song 
when he said he hopes to "discuss the important issues of the 
day with the leaders of the area." 
  He also could act as "a messenger" between the leaders of 
South and North Korea since he said he plans to visit Seoul 
following his stay in Pyongyang. 
  Despite efforts by Carter himself to play down the 
significance of his trip, official expectations in Washington 
are apparently running high as a White House spokesman told 
reporters, unsolicited, that Carter is expected to meet Kim 
Il-song. Moreover, the State Department confirmed that it has 
already briefed the former President on the nuclear issue. 
  Such high expectations are also based on Carter's experience 
as a peace mediator in Panama, Nicaragua, Sudan and the Middle 
East. 
  Some Korea watchers in Washington point out that Pyongyang 
has shown a sympathetic attitude toward Carter and therefore, if 
there is anyone best suited to helping resolve the North Korean 
nuclear row, it must be the former U.S. President. 
  On the other side of the coin, however, is a sizeable body 
of 
opinion in the U.S. Capital that too much significance should 
not be attached to Carter's visit. Commentators in this camp 
note that Carter's trip is being realized at "Pyongyang's 
initiative" and not Washington's. 
  In order, perhaps, to discourage the public from expecting 
too much, Carter himself noted in his statement that North Korea 
has issued many invitations in the past, making it clear the 
upcoming visit has not been "hastily arranged" for any 
particular purpose. 
  One State Department official involved in the dispute over 
North Korea's nuclear program said there have indeed been 
suggestions in some quarters that Washington send a special 
envoy to Pyongyang. 
  But the official said he wanted to make it unequivocally 
clear that the question of sending a special envoy to Pyongyang 
has not been studied. 
  Nevertheless, any new attempt to resolve the issue appears 
to 
be worth watching as the United States is experiencing 
difficulties in putting together a Security Council resolution 
on economic sanctions and North Korea is reacting strongly 
against moves by Washington and its allies.

  [Text] Seoul, June 10 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu said Friday that former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's 
planned visit to North Korea will not help settle the row over 
its nuclear program. 
  Han made the remark at a supreme council meeting of the 
ruling Democratic Liberal Party when he was asked to comment on 
the news by Rep. Pak Chong-su. The minister said carter will 
visit Seoul first on his way to Pyongyang. 
  "The former American president is making the trip as a 
private person and there is no need to stop his Pyongyang 
visit," he said. He explained that when Carter comes to Seoul, 
he will be fully apprised of the government's position on the 
seriousness of the situation. 
  Han said, "If Carter goes to Pyongyang, he will relay to the 
North Koreans how serious the international situation is and 
there will be serious consequences if North Korea does not 
cooperate."

  [Text] For one hour this morning, U.S. Forces Korea [USFK] 
opened one battery of Patriot missiles to ROK and foreign 
reporters at the air base in Osan, Kyonggi Province, and 
demonstrated its operation. 
  The battery opened to reporters today is under one battalion 
deployed to the USFK at the beginning of April. It is composed 
of a command vehicle, a communications vehicle, a radar, a 
generator vehicle, and eight launching pads. 
  The USFK disclosed that the Patriot missiles are capable of 
defending areas as far as Seoul, in addition to the Osan base, 
adding that they are ready for combat anytime now that they are 
on an around-the-clock readiness posture. 
  About 40 reporters, including some 30 foreign 
correspondents, 
engaged in fierce competition today to cover the Patriot 
missiles, thereby showing the foreign media's deep interest in 
the current security situation surrounding the Korean peninsula 
related to the North's nuclear development.

  [Text] Seoul, June 10 (YONHAP) -- A subcommittee meeting of 
the Korea-U.S. Security Consultative Meeting (SCM), originally 
set to be held in Honolulu on June 14-15, has been postponed 
indefinitely due to a situation on the part of the United 
States, the Defense Ministry reported on Friday. 
  "The United States had repeatedly asked for the postponement 
of the meeting on the grounds that they had little prepared for 
it," a ministry official said. He said the two sides will 
determine the time and place of the meeting later. 
  The postponement of the meeting draws keen attention because 
it comes at a time when tension is rising over the North Korean 
nuclear question. The subcommittee meeting was to discuss key 
military issues pending between the two countries such as the 
question of whether to hold the Team Spirit exercise and the 
issue of defense cost sharing, ahead of the main SCM meeting 
usually taking place in November.

  [Text] Vladivostok, June 7 (YONHAP) -- President Kim 
Yong-sam arrived here from Khabarovsk on Tuesday morning and 
visited the Russian Navy's Pacific Fleet, winding up his 
seven-day trip to Russia and Uzbekistan. 
  On board an anti-submarine ship anchored alongside the 
fleet's pier No. 33, Kim toured the warship's decks, torpedo 
launchers and command post, guided by the fleet commander. 
  After the tour, he said it had taken nearly half a century 
for a South Korean president to overcome the cold war and visit 
Vladivostok, even though the city is within hailing distance of 
the Tumen River. 
  "Standing here today, I've come to believe that the 
half-century tragedy of the Korean peninsula has come to an 
end," he remarked. 
  Noting that the ship he visited had fought on the allied 
side 
in the Persian Gulf war, Kim said South Korea had also joined 
the allied effort in the war, adding that South Korea and Russia 
will cooperate closely to ensure world peace and the security of 
Northeast Asia. 
  "I'd like to share the impression I've got from Russia's 
efforts at reform and openness with all peace-loving peoples, 
and I sincerely hope that the day will soon come when the last 
legacy of the cold war will disappear from the Korean peninsula 
so that the way to this city will become much shorter and easier 
for South Koreans," he said. 
  Kim's visit to the Russian fleet bore significance in that 
it 
has raised the possibility of South Korean-Russian military 
cooperation, a ranking official accompanying Kim said. 
  Earlier in Khabarovsk, Kim met with the Khabarovsk 
provincial 
governor on the issues of South Korean corporations operating in 
the Province and the interests and rights of ethnic Koreans. 
  In Vladivostok, he met the maritime province governor. 
  Kim is to leave for Seoul on Tuesday evening.

  [Text] Seoul, June 10 (YONHAP) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin is expected to visit South Korea around November this 
year, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Friday. 
  Han told leaders of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party 
(DLP) 
that the goverment would ask President Yeltsin to come in the 
second half of this year as a follow-up to President Kim 
Yong-sam's recent visit to Moscow. 
  At a DLP Central Executive Council meeting, he said, "the 
date of President Yeltsin's visit has not been fixed yet, but we 
expect that he would visit here around November this year." 
  Han added, "the Foreign Ministry plans to translate the 
Russian documents on the Korean War, which the Russian 
Government gave to the South Korean Government during President 
Kim's visit there, by June 25 -- the 44th anniversary of the 
outbreak of the Korean War -- and to open them to the public." 
Han said the ministry will form a special task force to 
translate and oversee the opening of the documents. 
  Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry will soon begin 
consultations 
with the Russian Foreign Ministry on the ownership of the former 
Russian legation site and ways to cooperate in the defense 
industry, Han said.

  [Text] North Korea has become a hub for laundering Chinese 
farm and marine products for export to the South. 
  The laundering has become frequent recently and abuses the 
non-tariff privileges for North Korean products in accordance 
with the law concerning the promotion of inter-Korean exchanges 
legislated in August, 1990. 
  The concept is similar to money laundering on black markets 
to avoid tax payment or the tracing of money flow. 
  One of the laundering processes presumed to exist by the 
customs authorities is for traders to receive certificates of 
country of origin and quarantine inspections in conspiracy with 
Pyongyang authorities bringing Chinese products into the North 
before shipping them to the South. 
  Another type is for domestic importers to conspire with 
their 
counterparts in third nations, including Japan and Hong Kong, to 
import Chinese products disguising them as North Korean produce. 
  The customs authorities have reached their conclusions about 
the laundering process based on several cases of detection of 
disguised imports. But they have not been able to obtain 
clear-cut evidence as the laundering is taking place in China 
and North Korea and they cannot understand will their trading 
and customs practices, a customs official said. [sentence as 
received] 
  Inchon Customs Office detected four false claims since 1991 
till last February but arrested only two importers involved in 
the laundering. The office has faced difficulty in proceeding 
to the trial because of the lack of evidence and appeals by 
defendants to higher courts, buying attorneys, the official said. 
  The office recently launched investigations of alleged 
imports of Chinese royal jelly upon a tip from the Korea 
Beekeepers Association that 10 tons of North Korean royal jelly 
customs-cleared in Inchon was Chinese product. 
  But the jelly contains the certificate oe North Korean 
origin 
confirmed by Pyongyang North Korean Taesong No. 8 Trade Co., the 
official said, adding that there was no defect in the documents. 
As a result, the office has failed to confirm it was from China. 
  The office also found that 554 tons of walnuts brought in by 
an importer through the port of Inchon in January this year were 
in fact Chinese product. The Chinese walnuts were found to 
have been transported by rail from China to Nampo on the western 
coast of North Korea, where they were transshipped to the South 
with North Korean certificates of country of origin and 
quarantine documents, he said. 
  He explained the rail luggage labels were still attached to 
the farm produce verifying that the products were transported by 
rail from China. "We were very lucky in being able to confirm 
this," he said. 
  A walnut importer, who is also suspicious of rampant 
laundering said that walnuts imported from North Korea were 
double the volume produced in the north last year. 
  Major reasons of the laundering are that Chinese products 
are 
not as good as North Korea's and traders are able to make much 
profit due to duty-free prices, the official said. 
  Another speculation is that importers of Chinese products 
have a tacit understanding with the North Korean authorities on 
the laundering in return for paying a portion of the value to 
the North which is hungry for foreign currency. 
  Meanwhile, Yi Hwan-kyun, commissioner of the Korea Customs 
Administration, ordered customs officials across the country to 
thoroughly crack down on disguised imports of Chinese farm and 
marine products under North Korean certificates of origin last 
week.

    [Editorial Report] Nearly all Seoul dailies disapproved of 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's remarks during his 20 May 
meeting with Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh. The 22 May papers 
all mentioned the portion of Han's speech that brought heavy 
criticism. Except for HANGYORE SINMUN, all the dailies were 
angry over Han's statement that "regretably, there had been a 
period of wounding between Korea and Vietnam..." The papers 
called this "irresponsible words by a responsible official." 
CHOSON ILBO, in its editorial called this one of several 
blunders Han has made since his appointment and urged him to 
"rein in his tongue." HANGUK ILBO expressed its disapproval: 
"The Vietnamese government has not asked for an apology; our 
government has no policy of apologizing for participating in the 
Vietnam War; why did Han apologize?" 

    Both CHOSON ILBO and HANGUK ILBO pointed out that "the 
Vietnam War was a war between the free and the communist worlds 
during the cold-war era and our role was part of a mission 
trying to maintain regional security and protect freedom. We 
need make no apologies or excuses for our part. HANGUK ILBO 
asked rhetorically: "Did the Chinese apologize for fighting 
against us during the Korean War?." According to the CHOSON 
ILBO, Han should know better than anyone that the United States 
and Vietnam are negotiating to establish diplomatic relations 
and that the subject of the Vietnam War is on the agenda, thus 
it was not an issue in which South Korea should be involved. 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' [MOFA] spokesperson tried to 
represent the issue as a "mere diplomatic gesture" and urged the 
media not to read into Han's statement what is not there. The 
media was not satisfied: HANGUK ILBO demanded "how can a 
diplomat make a speech without the support of government 
policy?", adding that Han's speech was an "insult to our many 
soldiers who gave their lives as well as to the surviving 
veterans" of the war. 
  While most Seoul dailies protested Han's comments, HANGYORE 
SINMUN carried an article on pages 1 and 3 praising Han's 
remarks as a "step towards national diplomatic maturity" while 
saying that they "did not amount to an official apology." In 
reality, the paper claimed, Han had acknowledged "our 
involvement in an `unjust war'". The paper said Han's statement 
to the Vietnamese "improved our diplomatic position a notch" 
relative to the Chinese and Japanese. HANGUK ILBO and CHOSON 
ILBO reported that MOFA, however, cautioned the media not to 
compare Han's statement in Vietnam with Japan's apology to 
Korea.

<F P=106> [Report by Yi Sok-u on an interview with ROK Foreign </F>
Minister Han Sung-chu by domestic reporters at Kimpo Airport, 
Seoul on 9 June] 
  [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, returning from his 
visit to Russia, the United Nations, and China, met with 
reporters upon his arrival at Kimpo Airport on 9 June. He said, 
"China has been cooperative so far and I hope China will 
continue to play a constructive role in the future as well." 
Foreign Minister Han expressed satisfaction over the ROK-PRC 
foreign ministers' talks he had in Beijing. 
  [Question] Would you comment on your visit to China? 
  [Han Sung-chu] I had close consultations on the North Korean 
nuclear issue with China. I am satisfied with the results of 
the consultations. 
  [Question] Dialogue with North Korea was discontinued. Would 
you comment? 
  [Han] Continuing dialogue is the government's policy. The 
problem is, however, that it is impossible to have dialogue. 
  [Question] What did you discuss with Chinese Foreign 
Minister 
Qian Qichen? 
  [Han] I visited China after realizing how serious the North 
Korean nuclear issue is internationally. The UN Security 
Council is about to impose sanctions on North Korea. I visited 
China, first, to call on it to cooperate in passing a resolution 
at the UN Security Council and, second, to ask it to persuade 
North Korea to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA]. I did so in the belief that it was important for 
me to know what China thought about adopting a resolution on 
sanctions. China has assumed a cooperative attitude and played 
positive roles. China said this time, as well, that it would 
play constructive roles. 
  [Question] Would you elaborate on your discussion with 
China? 
  [Han] In the first place, I did not expect China to express 
its support for or opposition to a resolution on sanctions. 
China will make a decision depending on whether or not North 
Korea will fulfill its duties as a member of the IAEA. I will 
not say there was some concrete achievement from the 
consultations this time. The consultations were meaningful in 
that the ROK and China exchanged views and furthered their 
mutual understanding. 
  [Question] What are the prospects for discussing a 
resolution 
on sanctions? 
  [Han] Unless North Korea changes its current attitude, a 
resolution on sanctions will be presented, and I think the 
adoption of a resolution will be unavoidable. 
  [Question] Do you think that it is possible to measure North 
Korea's fuel rods in the future? 
  [Han] North Korea alleges that it is still possible to 
verify its past activities. This allegation is groundless given 
the information and facts available now. North Korea presenting 
evidence on its past activities and declaring that it would 
ensure complete nuclear safeguards would open the way for 
dialogue. 
  [Question] Would you elaborate on consultations among the 
ROK, the United States, and Japan? 
  [Han] The three countries have so far discussed 
countermeasures, including a resolution on sanctions. 
  I held talks with the foreign ministers of the United States 
and Japan over the telephone or during personal meetings. My 
main concern is to pass a resolution on sanctions at the UN 
Security Council. I have never imagined a resolution on 
sanctions would not pass the UN Security Council.

  [Text] Seoul, June 10 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu said on Friday that unless there is a significant 
change in the attitude of North Korea, sanctions would certainly 
be adopted by the U.N. Security Council. 
  Testifying at the Assembly Foreign Affairs and Unification 
Committee, Han said a draft resolution is being worked out and 
would take shape around next week. 
  "We don't feel the need to promote sanctions against North 
Korea outside the frame of the United Nations at the moment," 
the foreign minister said. 
  With regard to China's posture, Han said China's emphasis on 
dialogue does not necessarily mean that they are against a 
Security Council resolution. "Their efforts to resolve the 
matter through dialogue do not run counter to ours either," he 
said. 
  He said Russian President Boris Yeltsin clearly said in his 
recent talks with President Kim Yong-sam that his country would 
cooperate with South Korea in the nuclear question. 
  On the reported plan of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter 
to 
visit Pyongyang, Minister Han said he believes that given the 
time, his visit would be of not much help. "Now that the visit 
has already been planned, however, we intend to make his visit 
helpful," he said. "We will let him know about our position and 
will make him tell the North Koreans about the consequences they 
would face once the nuclear issue goes unsettled." 
  Han said that the United States' policy is not to tolerate 
any possession of nuclear arms by North Korea. 
  "If North Korea had nuclear weapons, the United States, U.N. 
Security Council and other countries will not tolerate it under 
all circumstances," he said. 
  The minister said there are no unusual military movements in 
North Korea presently. "But, it will be a necessary and 
responsible act for us to secure full military deterrence 
especially at this time when North Korea threatens to regard any 
sanctions as a war declaration against them," Minister Han said. 
  Saying the door to dialogue remains open, the minister said 
the situation is such that various dialogues including 
South-North talks can take place depending on the attitude of 
North Korea.

  [Text] On the morning of 10 June, the government discussed 
countermeasures related to the imposition of sanctions against 
the North by holding a unification-national security policy 
coordination meeting presided over by Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime 
minister and minister of the National Unification Board, at the 
secretariat for the North-South talks in Samchong-dong in Seoul. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who returned home yesterday, 
gave a report on movements of the United States and China, 
permanent members of the UN Security Council. An in-depth 
discussion took place on ways to persuade China and Russia, 
which are now showing passive attitudes, to impose sanctions. 
  Also, the government understood that the proposal put forth 
yesterday by North Korea's Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam for 
accepting additional inspections of the nuclear facilities in 
the Yongbyon area is surely an attempt to weaken the 
international cooperative system. The government decided to 
make further diplomatic efforts to make the countries concerned 
understand this. 
  The government once again confirmed its position that the 
sanctions against North Korea should be imposed in stages, 
swiftly, and effectively, while checking up on ways for a 
pangovernmental countermeasure in connection with the imposition 
of sanctions. 
  In today's meeting, in particular, with the judgment that 
the 
current national security is being threatened, the government 
discussed ways to solidify the national security system aimed at 
preparing against all types of provocations by North Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, June 10 (YONHAP) -- The government has 
decided to cooperate closely with the United States and Japan so 
that a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for sanctions 
against North Korea can be adopted next week or thereafter. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu will discuss the sanctions 
issue during meetings with U.S. Undersecretary of State Peter 
Tarnoff and Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa. Tarnoff 
and Kakizawa will come to Seoul on Friday and Saturday, 
respectively. 
  The government's decision was made Friday morning at a 
meeting to coordinate national unification and security policy 
held at the South-North dialogue secretariat in Samchong-dong. 
The meeting was presided over by Vice Prime Minister Yi 
Hong-ku, who is national unification minister. 
  After the meeting, Yi said through his spokesman Kim 
Hyong-ki 
that the government hoped to persuade the U.N. Security Council 
to adopt a resolution on sanctions against Pyongyang as soon as 
possible through consultations with related countries, including 
the United States. 
  The spokesman said sanctions should be adopted soon as the 
cooling period for spent fuel rods taken recently from North 
Korea's 5-megawatt reactor is only three months, disclosing that 
"the government position is to have the council adopt sanctions 
next week at the earliest." 
  Yi emphasized the sanctions' ultimate goal is securing the 
transparency of North Korea's nuclear program, adding the 
government plans to leave the dialogue channel open at every 
stage in the course of imposing sanctions against Pyongyang. 
  He said that "dialogue with North Korea is only possible 
when 
it is prepared to show sincerity so the international suspicion 
over its nuclear adventure is eliminated completely," 
reaffirming that sanctions are inevitable unless Pyongyang 
changes its attitude. 
  As to the "sincere measures" by North Korea, the spokesman 
cited as an example the North's acceptance of special 
inspections of its undeclared nuclear sites and the opening of 
records on its nuclear reactor.

  [Text] Today, President Kim Yong-sam invited senior retired 
generals, including Messrs. Paek Son-yop, Kim Sin, Han Sin, Yi 
Maeng-ki, Chae Myong-sin, and Yi Pyong-hyong, to Chongwadae 
[presidential offices], and explained to them over a luncheon 
the recent security situation. 
  President Kim stressed that the military cooperative system 
between the ROK and the United States is closer than ever. 
  At the meeting, Lt. Gen. Chae Myong-sin, retired, said that 
Vietnam fell not because it was short of arms but because it had 
no will to fight and its spiritual strength was weak, and added 
that the young people should equip themselves with more thorough 
security-consciousness and resolve to defend the country. 
  Gen. Paek Son-yop, retired, said that the War Memorial Hall 
should become a training ground to inspire the young people with 
the resolve to defend the country. Lt. Gen. Kim Sin, retired, 
stressed the importance of laying up for a rainy day, taking as 
an example the underground roadway in Beijing which can be used 
as a shelter in case of emergency. 
  Gen. Han Sin, retired, said that the result of President 
Kim's visit to Russia was like disarming North Korea.

  [Text] The Ministry of Home Affairs has decided to conduct 
a civil defense exercise on 15 June focusing on an anti-air raid 
exercise on a nationwide scale, rather than the exercises to 
prepare for disasters that the Home Ministry has focused on to 
date. 
  The 15 June civil defense exercise will consist of the 
sounding of the air-raid siren, the residents taking refuge into 
shelters, control of motor vehicles, emergency rehabilitation 
work in preparation for the power outage and cut-off of 
water-supply, and the exercise in preparation for chemical, 
biological, and radiological warfare. 
  The Home Ministry has also decided to check all the 
facilities in preparation for war, such as some 223,000 shelters 
and some 59,000 emergency water-supply facilities across the 
country. This is the first time that all the war-time shelter 
facilities will be checked across the country. 
  The Home Ministry has also decided to distribute pamphlets 
through neighborhood meetings on 25 June guiding the people as 
to how they should act in a time of war, including a nuclear war. 
  The government has also decided to conduct the Chungmu 
Exercise, a regional general crisis management exercise, in 
Seoul and its vicinity for six days beginning 22 August. Eight 
government ministries, including the Home Ministry, will 
participate in this exercise to be conducted by the State 
Contingency Planning Committee to check the ability to cope with 
disasters, such as power outages, cut-off of water-supply, and 
food shortages.

  [Text] Seoul, June 10 (YONHAP) -- Kim Tok, director of the 
Agency for National Security Planning (NSP), said Friday the 
biggest problem facing the country is the possibility that North 
Korea may misjudge the situation and provoke an emergency. 
  Kim told NSP officials at a ceremony commemorating the 33rd 
anniversary of the agency's founding that North Korea's nuclear 
development program poses a serious problem, asking the 
officials to prepare for the possibility of an emergency 
situation. 
  He emphasized specialization, efficiency, 
internationalization and science as the NSP's four operating 
principles and called on the officials to help establish the 
agency as an "intelligence organization of the people." 
  The intelligence body was inaugurated on June 10, 1961, as 
the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) and changed its 
name to the Agency for National Security Planning (NSP) on Jan. 
1, 1981.

  [Text] Seoul, June 3 (YONHAP) -- Former President No Tae-u 
left the country Saturday afternoon for Germany to attend the 
12th meeting of the international council of former heads of 
government (IAC) taking place in Dresden on June 7-10. 
  No will return home on June 13 from the trip which is his 
first overseas travel since he left the presidency in February 
last year. 
  He was seen off at the Kimpo Airport by about 50 former 
senior administration and Chongwadae [presidential offices] 
officials under his presidency. They included the five 
ex-premiers under him -- Kang Yong-hun, Chong Won-sik, Yi 
Hyon-chae, No Chae-pong and Hyon Sung-chong. 
  "I think it is significant and worthwhile for me to help the 
country and government taking advantage of various experiences I 
had in five years in the past," No said at the airport. 
  He was accompanied to the visit by former Chongwadae 
spokesman Kim Hak-chun, his secretary No Mun-song and two others.

  [Text] Seoul, June 7 (YONHAP) -- Four independent lawmakers 
announced Tuesday they have joined the United People's Party 
(UPP), raising the number of UPP representatives in the National 
Assembly from 12 to 16. 
  In a press conference at UPP headquarters, Reps. Yang 
Sun-chik, Yim Chun-won, Pak Kyu-sik and Kim Chin-yong said they 
made the move in order to respond to the people's desire to see 
a third political force emerge. 
  They claimed that since the inauguration of President Kim 
Yong-sam, the nation has witnessed "wasteful politicking" in the 
polarized political sector. 
  They vowed to realize a new form of politics by forming a 
powerful third force and by liquidating the "two Kims era" and 
regional hegemonism, referring to the domination of Kyongsang 
Province by the ruling Democratic Liberal Party led by President 
Kim Yong-sam and Cholla Province by the main opposition 
Democratic Party once headed by Kim Tae-chung. 
  Rep. Chong Chu-il, who had been rumored to join the UPP, has 
apparently decided against it as his aides informed reporters 
that Chong had told them not to make any political announcements 
while he is visiting the United States. 
  With the four new members, the United People's Party hopes 
to 
form a parliamentary negotiating group in the assembly, which 
requires 20 or more lawmakers, by absorbing additional 
independent lawmakers and merging with the New Political Reform 
Party as announced earlier. 
  Rep. Kim Tong-kil, head of the UPP, said his party plans to 
hold a national convention on June 29 and a convention of the 
merged party to complete the merger process.

  [Text] Seoul, June 8 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
will have a separate meeting with opposition Democratic Party 
Chairman Yi Ki-taek right after a Chongwadae [presidential 
offices] luncheon Wednesday to exchange views on the North 
Korean nuclear standoff and pending political issues. 
  At the meeting, the two will focus on the National Assembly 
investigation of the Sangmudae scandal, which has been stalled 
by related agencies refusing to produce documents requested by 
parliamentary inspectors. 
  Wednesday's luncheon was arranged for Kim to brief leaders 
of 
the three government branches and chairmen of the ruling 
Democratic Liberal Party and opposition Democratic Party on the 
results of his recent visits to Russia and Uzbekistan. 
  Yi, recalling President Kim's promise at a May 28 meeting to 
instruct the cabinet to cooperate in the parliamentary 
investigation within legal limits, will urge Kim to make a 
decision so the probe can proceed to a smooth conclusion while 
the parliament's prestige is respected. 
  The president, explaining the need for international 
sanctions against North Korea over its suspected nuclear arms 
development program, will ask for the opposition party's 
cooperation in a supra-partisan approach to diplomatic and 
security issues, including the nuclear problem. 
  The opposition leader, noting that adopting sanctions is not 
the best policy, will stress that the nuclear problem must be 
settled peacefully in the United Nations and propose a direct 
inter-Korean contact to find a solution. 
  On Kim's appointment of six new justices, Yi will ask the 
president to exclude those who have cooperated with past 
military governments.

  [Text] Seoul, June 10 (YONHAP) -- The main opposition 
Democratic Party [DP], deciding Friday to suspend the 
parliamentary investigation of the Sangmudae scandal, called on 
the government and the ruling party to change their attitude 
toward the probe into allegations of political fund abuse. 
  Depending on whether the government and the Democratic 
Liberal Party [DLP] change their stance, the DP said it would 
publicly condemn, or bring suits against, those involved in the 
scandal. 
  The opposition party also threatened to publish the records 
of investigations by the prosecution or the military as 
newspaper advertisements, taking the case directly to the people. 
  The decision was made at a meeting of the party's supreme 
council presided over by Chairman Yi Ki-taek Friday morning. 
  The meeting concluded it was meaningless to pursue the 
National Assembly investigation into the scam because of the 
government's and the DLP's non-cooperative attitude, especially 
in checking out official documents and tracing checks, sources 
said. 
  Consequently, the parliamentary investigation that started 
May 21 was suspended nine days early. The National Assembly had 
originally decided to conduct the probe until June 19. 
  The DP had demanded the investigation, claiming that a 
construction company owned by Cho Ki-hyon created a slush fund 
out of profits it made from a defense contract. The opposition 
party alleges that part of the fund was funnelled into the 
ruling party during the 1992 presidential election.

    [Editorial Report] The 2 June CHUGAN CHOSON on page 70 
reported that the National Security Planning Board [NSP] is 
carrying out Director Kim Tok's promise to make it a respectable 
agency. It will concentrate on gathering information that will 
enhance South Korea's competitiveness. According to CHUGAN 
CHOSON, a 30-page NSP publication "International Industry and 
Business Information Report," carries information about 
international business and trade, industrial technology, 
resource materials, energy, and environmental issues. The 
article pointed out that the high-quality information is 
gathered by NSP agents worldwide which is unavailable to other 
government agencies such as the Korea Trade Promotion 
Corporation [KOTRA]. Much of it comes from specialized 
magazines, technical journals, and newspapers where NSP agents 
are stationed. The publication also provides medium and 
long-range forecasts. 
  The NSP printed approximately 500 copies of its publication 
and distributed it to government agencies, the Korea Chamber of 
Commerce, the Federation of Korean Industries, and various 
economic research centers. The article reported that consumer 
response has been excellent and demand is so great that, 
beginning this month, an additional 170 copies will be printed. 
The NSP plans to pay special attention to disseminating 
information needed by small to medium-size businesses and 
regional university research centers. 

    The article praised the NSP for this worthwhile service, the 
first of its kind in the agency's 33 years of existence.

  [Text] Seoul, June 4 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Korean 
Government has decided to import 39,000 tons of garlic and 
28,000 tons of onions to offset an expected shortage caused by a 
poor crop this year. The domestic supply of the pungent bulbs is 
expected to fall short of demand due to a poor harvest and a 
decrease in arable land, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry 
and Fisheries said Saturday. 
  This year's garlic and onion production is estimated at 
372,000 tons and 555,000 tons, respectively, compared to demand 
of 450,000 tons and 590,000 tons. Half of the garlic shortfall, 
39,000 tons, will be met by imports and the rest by early 
production of green and unripe garlic, the ministry disclosed. 
  Of the onion shortage, 28,000 tons will come from overseas 
and the remaining 7,000 tons from early production of a variety 
from Cheju Province. 
  This year's imports of garlic and onions will set records in 
terms of tonnage. The previous highs for garlic and onion 
imports were 19,000 tons in 1985 and 17,000 tons last year, 
respectively. 
  A ministry official said the bulbs will be imported from 
July 
to February 1995, adding imports for early next year will be 
covered by the minimum market access provided by the Uruguay 
Round. He explained that the ministry urged farmers last year to 
grow more garlic and onions, but the land set aside for 
cultivating garlic has decreased by 3.6 percent from the 
previous year while arable land for onions remained the same. 
  Meanwhile, the wholesale price of garlic last month was 
1,400 
won per kilogram, 33.5 percent higher than 1,050 won in the same 
month last year. Onions sold for 515 won per kg, a whopping 2.8 
times higher than the same month last year.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa voiced hopes Friday that North Korea will make 
concessions in the controversy over its alleged nuclear weapons 
program. 
  "North Korea, taking it seriously that the international 
community will possibly take concerted sanction measures, is 
sending the message that it could accept (nuclear) inspections," 
Kakizawa told an interpellation session at the House of 
Councillors Budget Committee. 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, also speaking before the 
committe, reiterated that Japan would join the United States and 
South Korea in economic support to the North provided Pyongyang 
accepts full inspections of the country's nuclear facilities. 
  Hata also indicated that the ruling coalition would back 
military measures within a framework of "universal security." 
But he added, "of course we cannot participate in military 
measures involving use of weapons, which is prohibited by 
Article 9 of the Constitution." 
  Japan's pacifist postwar Constitution states in the article, 
"the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right 
of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of 
settling international disputes." 
  Legislator Makoto Taneda of the opposition Social Democratic 
Party (SDP), however, urged the government to clarify from which 
article in the Constitution it draws its support for collective 
defense. 
  Takao Ode, head of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau, 
acknowledged that the Constitution does not incorporate "a 
concrete article" on the issue. But, he said, Japan's 
connection with collective defense arises "from our joining the 
U.N. Charter." 
  The interpellation session will be carried over to Monday as 
Taneda was not satisfied with the government's answers.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Chinese Ambassador to Japan 
Xu Dunxin renewed China's stance Friday that it wants to solve 
through dialogue and negotiations an international row over 
North Korea's suspected nuclear development, Foreign Ministry 
officials said. 
  Xu reiterated the Chinese stance in a meeting over lunch 
with 
Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, who will visit Beijing on 
Sunday, the officials said. The ambassador told Kakizawa that 
China's basic position is that it supports the denuclearization 
of the Korean peninsula and considers peace and stability in 
Northeast Asia as important. Beijing has been making efforts to 
solve the problem and will continue to do so, Xu was quoted as 
saying. 
  Kakizawa told the Chinese ambassador that Japan and China 
share the perception that a peaceful solution to the problem is 
important but that the situation is becoming grave. The foreign 
minister called on China to exercise influence on North Korea. 
Kakizawa also told Xu he wants to engage in frank discussions 
on the North Korean situation with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian 
Qichen.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- A group of Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) lawmakers discussing Asian security issued a 
statement Thursday expressing regret over North Korea's 
suspected nuclear development program, saying it has caused 
grave distrust for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  The statement came as the largest opposition LDP is going to 
send a small group of its legislators, headed by former Defense 
Agency Director General Taku Yamasaki, to North Korea on Tuesday 
in an effort to find a solution to the nuclear row. 
  In the statement, the party's study group on Asian security 
called on North Korea to return fully to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) at the earliest possible date. 
  Japan's largest political party, which up until last August 
had held a 38-year reign, also demanded that North Korea 
cooperate with the IAEA's request for inspections of its nuclear 
sites, including two undeclared facilities. 
  North Korea is suspected of secretly converting plutonium 
obtained from its plants for development of nuclear weapons, and 
has refused to accept full inspections by the IAEA. 
  The Japanese coalition government, repeatedly expressing its 
regret over the issue, is maintaining close contact with the 
United States and South Korea on how to deal with the north's 
nuclear problem.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Emperor Akihito and Empress 
Michiko left Tokyo's Haneda airport Friday [10 June] morning for 
Atlanta, Georgia, to begin a 17-day, 11-city visit to the United 
States. 
  The emperor and empress are the first state guests of the 
administration of President Bill Clinton since he took office in 
January 1993. 
  In Atlanta, the emperor and empress will meet former 
President Jimmy Carter and Coretta Scott King, widow of 
assassinated civil rights leader Martin Luther King, government 
officials said. 
  They will be in Washington for four days from Saturday, and 
will meet President Bill Clinton, lay a wreath at Arlington 
Cemetery and visit an elementary school. 
  Clinton will hold a welcoming ceremony for the imperial 
couple Monday at the White House. 
  The couple will also travel to New York, St. Louis, Longmont 
and Denver in Colorado, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Honolulu. 
  In New York, they will meet UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus- Ghali, and in Los Angeles, former U.S. President Ronald 
Reagan. 
  In Honolulu, they will lay a wreath at the National Memorial 
Cemetery of the Pacific but will not visit Pearl Harbor, on 
which Japan launched a devastating attack on Dec. 7, 1941. 
  The government dropped plans for the emperor to visit the 
USS 
Arizona National Memorial at Pearl Harbor under pressure from 
conservative Japanese circles, who fear the emperor would be 
expected to make an apology for the attack that pulled the U.S. 
into World War II. 
  It is the second visit by a Japanese emperor to the U.S. 
Emperor Hirohito, posthumously known as Emperor Showa, made the 
first such visit in 1975. 
  It is also the imperial couple's first U.S. tour since the 
emperor succeeded his deceased father in January 1989, and their 
third official visit to the U.S., which they visited twice as 
crown prince and princess. 
  The couple will return to Tokyo on June 26.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- The House of Councillors is 
expected to approve the government's long-overdue fiscal 1994 
budget as soon as June 24, five days before the current Diet 
session ends, parliamentary sources said Friday [10 June]. 
  The prospect arose after the upper house's budget committee 
agreed earlier in the day to hold a public hearing June 20 on 
the 73 trillion yen budget for the fiscal year which started 
April 1. 
  The House of Representatives passed the budget Wednesday.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) will not help the largest opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) fell the current administration with a no-confidence 
motion unless the LDP closes policy gaps with the socialists, a 
top SDP strategist said Friday [10 June]. 
  "We will not go along with the LDP's no-confidence motion 
unless we can reach a policy agreement," said SDP Secretary 
General Wataru Kubo in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. 
  Kubo said the No. 2 opposition SDP will clarify and announce 
its positions on the appropriate Japanese response to counteract 
North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development program as well 
as on proposed tax system reform. 
  The SDP is noted as a staunch critic of proposed sanctions 
on 
North Korea and the proposed hiking of the 3 percent consumption 
tax. 
  The party will make clear its tenets over these critical 
issues in a policy platform document it is presently drawing up, 
he said. 
  "What is crucial for us is what policies would be 
implemented 
(by a new coalition government) and its decision-making 
process," said Kubo, the righthand man of SDP Chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama. 
  The SDP will demand, as a prerequisite to joining any new 
coalition, that the next coalition government set up a supreme 
policy-making panel in which the number of panelists from each 
party would be allocated in proportion to the number of each 
party's legislators in the coalition, he said. 
  If the next coalition to emerge, after an anticipated 
parliamentary power struggle following passage of the fiscal 
1994 budget, were a non-LDP coalition, the SDP would garner the 
greatest representation in the panel under the Kubo-proposed 
allocation scheme. 
  In the previous non-LDP coalition led by former Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the SDP was the biggest party with 
74 seats in the powerful House of Representatives, followed by 
Shinseito with 62 and Komeito with 52 seats. 
  Kubo also hinted the SDP will demand that policy-making 
authority be granted to a regular meeting of coalition party 
leaders, rather than conferring power on meetings of deputy 
chiefs of the parties as in the Hosokawa coalition. 
  In a separate interview, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi 
Ichikawa said his party is ready to compromise its longtime 
differences with the SDP concerning policies on the North Korean 
nuclear arms program as well as the decision-making issue. 
  Ichikawa said Komeito "can conform" its policies on the two 
main issues of concern to the SDP. 
  However, he predicted the current coalition parties would 
have to undergo hard bargaining in a bid to reconcile the gulf 
with the SDP over proposed consumption tax increases. 
  Closing the gaps on tax system reform "would take a lot of 
time in the process of talks," he said. 
  In the previous coalition, the SDP repeatedly expressed its 
dissatisfaction saying it had been distanced from important 
decision-making such as a proposed hike in the consumption tax 
rate and the opening of the rice market to foreign countries.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- The government and the 
ruling parties will draft tax reform bills by the end of June 
designed to increase net tax revenues through raising the 
consumption tax while making permanent income tax cuts, Finance 
Minister Hirohisa Fujii indicated Friday. 
  "The direction remains unchanged," Fujii said, referring to 
earlier promises by the government and the ruling parties to 
draft concrete full-fledged tax reform bills by the end of this 
month. Fujii made the comments to reporters after the day's 
regularly scheduled cabinet meeting. 
  He was also clarifying recent comments by Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata regarding the "conclusion" and "direction" of the 
tax reform also promised in the March market-opening package to 
be detailed by the end of June. 
  The United States is closely waiting for the decision after 
pressuring Japan to continue with 5.5 trillion yen in income tax 
cuts now limited to the current fiscal year as a measure to 
boost domestic demand and curb the trade surplus. 
  Regarding concrete figures, especially on a tax rate hike, 
Fujii said his ministry as "an administrative body" expects the 
bills to include them. He also reiterated his unchanged policy 
for enacting a tax hike and offsetting tax cuts in a single 
package to avoid the "untreated" issuance of deficit-covering 
bonds. 
  U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who had criticized 
the 
planned tax hike, recently eased his stance to accept Japan's 
plan to separate tax cuts and a hike "substantially" for at 
least three years. 
  The government and the ruling parties decided to issue 
"stopgap" red-ink bonds to finance the single-year tax cuts with 
a promise to decide on full-fledged tax reform after scrapping 
the 7 percent "national welfare tax" plan announced in February 
by then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Hosokawa's plan was 
seen as stemming from strong opposition by the finance minister 
over deficit-covering bonds. 
  With the promised tax reform, Fujii noted that he expects a 
net tax revenue increase with tax cuts and a hike to fund 
welfare spending because of Japan's aging society. The Tax 
Commission, an advisory panel to the prime minister, asked the 
ministry to take into account conditions for a net tax revenue 
increase for the recently issued "mechanical calculations" on 
revenue estimates in fiscal 2000 under the tax reform, Fujii 
said. 
  The ministry's estimates called for a three-year time lag 
between 6.2 trillion yen in tax cuts and a consumption tax hike, 
and cited a tax hike to above 6 percent from the current 3 
percent as the only way to attain a net revenue increase. "But 
I don't know what the panel will do with its report" slated to 
be issued soon, Fujii added. 
  Meanwhile, the ruling coalition parties issued a report 
Thursday, saying a consumption tax hike is inevitable with the 
aging society. 
  Fujii said discussions in the government and ruling parties 
are progressing smoothly toward drafting the bills by the end of 
June. But uncertainties remain as panel and coalition sources 
have said concrete figures might not be included to avoid 
disputes with the Social Democratic Party (SDP) which is 
sensitive to the issue of hiking the consumption tax. The SDP 
departed the ruling camp in April when the Hata cabinet was 
formed, thus giving the coalition shaky minority rule.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Japan will submit to the 
International Court of Justice (ICJ) a statement on the use of 
nuclear arms which deletes a phrase saying the use of nuclear 
arms does not violate international law, Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa said Friday [10 June]. Kakizawa told cabinet members 
Japan will submit its statement in time for a Friday deadline. 
  The Hague-based international court called on the various 
nations concerned to submit a statement of opinion on the use of 
nuclear weapons after the World Health Organization (WHO) 
requested it to decide whether or not nuclear warfare violates 
international law in May 1993. 
  The government intended to submit a paper which says the use 
of nuclear arms does not violate international law, but decided 
to delete the phrase after strong criticism from the opposition 
parties and Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb victims. 
  Kakizawa explained to ministers that the government made the 
decision after considering deliberation on the issue in the Diet 
and because the use of nuclear arms is antihumanitarian. He 
also said he hopes the decision "will help the antinuclear 
policies of the Hata administration make progress."

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- A government advisory panel 
Friday unveiled a plan to scale back Japan's plutonium recycling. 
  In an interim report on Japan's nuclear power policy, the 
advisory committee for energy scrapped an original scheme to 
start operation of a second nuclear recycling plant from around 
2010. 
  When to start the operation of the second plant, designed to 
reprocess spent nuclear fuel to produce plutonium, will be 
decided around 2010, the report said. 
  The report called for limiting Japan's nuclear recycling to 
a 
nuclear power plant in Rokkasho, Aomori Prefecture, until the 
second reprocessing plant is completed. 
  The Rokkasho plant is scheduled to begin reprocessing 
nuclear 
fuel around 2000, a delay from the mid-1990s of the previous 
plan, the report said. 
  Japan's first "fast breeder reactor" should be built early 
in 
the next decade rather than the second half of the 1990s as 
originally envisaged, it also said. 
  "The rescheduling does not mean Japan's nuclear policy has 
retreated," an official at the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry told a press conference. 
  "Its policy of promoting plutonium use remains unchanged," 
he 
said. 
  "Japan will proceed with the nuclear recycling plan in a 
manner that doesn't raise global concern over nuclear 
proliferation," he added.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- Japan must ease its grip on 
the financial markets to facilitate fund flows, particularly 
with other Asian markets, an advisory panel to the finance and 
trade ministers said Wednesday [8 June]. 
  The committee on foreign exchange and other [as received] 
also proposed a revision in Japan's statistics on international 
balance of payments, mainly switching to yen-denominated figures 
from the current U.S. dollar base. The statistics include 
politically sensitive current account figures used to measure 
trade imbalances. 
  The proposals in the annual report cited criticism at home 
and abroad over the tight market rules in Japan, an increasing 
role overseas of advanced financial derivatives and spreading 
moves by Japanese companies to enter other Asian nations. 
  "The annual report focused on Asia this year...especially 
with boosting direct investment by Japanese manufacturers and 
increasing competition with Hong Kong and Singapore financial 
markets," said Tomomitsu Oba, head of the committee's special 
group that compiled the report. 
  Speaking at a news conference after a panel meeting, Oba 
added that revising the balance of payment statistics is another 
key part of the report, noting, "all major nations offer them 
only in their own currencies." 
  A Finance Ministry official told the same news meeting that 
the ministry wants to revise the figures by the end of fiscal 
1997. 
  The panel said in the report, "further deregulatory steps 
are 
needed in our financial markets" to meet fund demand at home and 
from abroad through diversified fund-raising means. 
  It particularly expressed "full expectations" on commissions 
and taxes. 
  On financial derivatives such as options and swaps, the 
panel 
wants the government to "prepare acceptable products in our 
financial markets while ensuring transparency and fairness of 
transactions." 
  Strict rules over issuing bonds and stocks prevail in Japan 
despite a global trend for deregulation, and obtaining 
permission is especially difficult for financial derivatives 
that are becoming the mainstay in deregulated markets. 
  Japanese banks and securities firms are, in fact, 
increasingly moving to set up subsidiaries specializing in 
derivatives in Hong Kong and other Asian nations where 
regulations are far looser. 
  Focusing on such moves by financial institutions as well as 
by manufacturers to enter other Asian nations, the panel said it 
"expects our financial markets...to take a mutual complementary 
role with the Asian markets." 
  The report noted that fund demand is on a sharp rise in 
tandem with soaring entries by Japanese companies into the fast 
growing Asian economies since the late 1980s to cope with the 
yen's rise. 
  "But smooth procurement of long-term funds is still 
difficult 
there, excluding Hong Kong and Singapore," the panel said, 
calling for improvement of Japan's markets as a fund-raising 
vehicle for other Asian nations. 
  Meanwhile, the forum also suggested that some rules are 
needed for financial derivatives as the report mentioned only 
"acceptable products" and called for "transparency and fairness." 
  This apparently reflected heightening international concerns 
led by the United States that advanced, off-the-book derivatives 
may lead to unnecessary market volatility. 
  The panel said preparation of statistics for grasping the 
conditions is "not catching up" with the quick development of 
derivatives. 
  Along with such advanced financial transactions, service 
trade is also "diversifying and increasing" to make data 
currently included in the international balance of payments 
insufficient, the report said. 
  Against this backdrop, the panel called on the Finance 
Ministry to revamp the balance of payments statistics to improve 
service trade and investment data in line with a manual prepared 
last year by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Business sentiment among 
major manufacturers improved, with the quarterly "Tankan" survey 
index standing at minus 50 in may, up from minus 56 in the 
previous survey, the Bank of Japan said Friday [10 June]. 
  The diffusion index for major nonmanufacturers improved to 
minus 42 from the previous minus 46, the survey showed. Major 
manufacturers said in the previous February survey that business 
confidence would improve to minus 50 in may, while major 
nonmanufacturers saw an improvement to minus 40. The confidence 
index represents the percentage of companies answering 
"positively" minus those responding "negatively." 
  The labor index, or the net saying excessive labor force, 
for 
major firms, improved to 26 from the previous 28. The index of 
product inventories, or the net saying excessive stockpiles, 
stood at 23, compared with 30 in the previous survey. 
  Major manufacturers and nonmanufacturers plan to cut their 
capital investment for the current fiscal year by 3.7 percent 
from the year earlier, revising their plans from a yearly 4.5 
percent decline in the previous survey.

    [Editorial Report] The 6 May Jakarta KOMPAS in Indonesian 
on page 4 reported that a group of intellectuals from 17 private 
universities have agreed to establish the Indonesian Association 
of Nationalist Intellectuals (ICKI). President of 
Krisnadwipayana University Moehono, who was appointed to draw up 
ICKI's mandate, said that ICKI will bring together all existing 
intellectual organizations in terms of spirit and beliefs. He 
added that nationalist intellectuals are needed to counter the 
"adverse effects" of globalization facing the country in the 
second phase of its long-term development plan (1994-2019). The 
association will not be involved in politics and will neither 
affiliate with any formal political groups nor seek any position 
of power in the state's infrastructure, according to Moehono. 
The idea to establish ICKI was born following one of President 
Suharto's recent speeches, in which he said that divisions based 
on religion, social status, or ethnicity run counter to the 
spirit of the 1945 Constitution and the five principles of the 
state's Pancasila ideology. The association plans to hold its 
first national conference on 28 October to coincide with this 
year's Youth Pledge Day.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Malaysia's pragmatic policy of opening its markets 
far and wide and also seeking opportunities in what overseas 
markets have to offer continues to be [word indistinct] and 
beneficial. Malaysia's booming economy and rapid growth are 
factors that attract bilateral trade to grow at a steady rate 
with several countries: north, south, east, and west. 
  The latest big deal to be struck was a $600 million contract 
signed between Malaysia and Russia this week in Kuala Lumpur for 
18 MiG-29 Fulcrum air superiority fighter jets. Of this, $450 
million is to be paid in cash and the remainder will be supplied 
of Malaysian products; namely, palm oil to be delivered to 
Russia over the next five years. 
  Apart from that, Russia has also agreed to supply at no cost 
two MiG-29's to Malaysia's military and commercial aircraft 
servicing and overhaul center, the Aerod Company. This will 
help the latter's engineers to acquire the skills required in 
maintaining the frontline Russian fighter aircraft. 
  The deal took two years to become reality. The delay was 
because of the haggling over the price and the terms of the 
contract [words indistinct]. However, the vote for the contract 
to come [words indistinct]. 
  The deal marks the beginning of a new era in bilateral 
relations which was thought inconceivable a few years ago. 
Russia is now showing a deep interest and forging closer 
bilateral ties and economic cooperation with Malaysia. It wants 
to extend its expertise in the industrial, infrastructural, 
telecommunications, and energy sectors. Russia also fully 
supports Malaysia's need for training, research and development, 
and for technology transfer. Malaysia will study the possible 
areas of cooperation it wishes to venture into with the Russians. 
  The purchase of the Russian MiG's will no doubt prove to be 
immensely beneficial to Malaysia. It must be understood that 
Malaysia does not confine itself to any particular country when 
awarding contracts and it is driven by the benefits that the 
country can derive through such efforts. 
  A [word indistinct] factor in the Russian contract is the 
proposed establishment of a regional Technical Service Center,

country's aerospace industry. The center, a joint venture 
between the Malaysian Government and three Russian bodies, will 
service the MiG-29 aircraft operated not only by the Royal 
Malaysian Air Force but also the other air forces in the region. 
The TSC is an example of how bilateral economic and trade 
relations between Malaysia and Russia can be strengthened 
further. 
  There is vast potential for the two countries to jointly 
explore new areas of trade. [Word indistinct] the MiG deals are 
concerned, it marks the entry of Russian fighter aircraft into 
the Southeast Asia market. And Malaysia welcomes the transfer 
of knowhow by the Russian defense industries in Malaysia's 
avionics and aircraft component manufacturing. 
  The visit of the Russian team to Malaysia to sign the 
contract will pave the way for the [words indistinct] between 
the two countries in the future.

<F P=106> [By M. Krishnamoorthy] </F>
  [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, Wed -- Britain will be asked to 
clarify the statement by its Trade Minister Richard Needham that 
pressure would grow on his government to retaliate if Malaysia 
continues with its policy of not awarding government contracts 
to British firms. 
  Acting Foreign Affairs Minister Datuk Abu Hassan Omar said 
today Wisma Putra [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] had been 
directed to check with the British Government as soon as 
possible. 
  Abu Hassan said the clarification was necessary because 
Needham had led a trade delegation with an interest to invest in 
and trade with Malaysia. 
  "I do not think Needham came here with the intention of 
seeking to lift the ban on contracts to British firms. 
  "I think he was here to promote British trade and investment 
with Malaysia," Abu Hassan said after being briefed by a Wisma 
Putra official. 
  When asked if the Malaysian Government was considering 
lifting the ban, he said that the matter would have to be 
studied in the light of recent developments . 
  We need to see their sincerity of wanting to do business 
with 
us and at the same time monitor the British media and its 
reports on Malaysia." 
  The issue of lifting the ban, he said, was being studied by 
the government. 
  "Malaysia welcomes British businessmen's interest to invest 
in the country. It is a step in the right direction. 
  "The Government also is happy to have British companies 
invest in joint ventures with Malaysian companies and at the 
same time we welcome the transfer of technology from Britain," 
he added. 
  Needham flew into Kuala Lumpur for the second time in two 
weeks last Saturday. He was here on May 23 for the Pacific 
Basin Economic Council (PBEC) meeting during which he delivered 
a letter from British Prime Minister John Major to Prime 
Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed. [passage omitted on 
Needham speaking to REUTERS] 
  During his visit, Needham, who met Dr. Mahathir and several 
other cabinet ministers with a British trade delegation, had 
repeatedly said there were no indications that the ban would be 
lifted and that the issue was not discussed. 
  Needham had said the issue of the ban on government 
contracts 
for British firms was also not brought up by the British 
businessmen in their discussion with Dr. Mahathir as their 
priority was seeking more investment opportunities in Malaysia. 
  But in an about-turn yesterday, he told REUTERS that he 
expected the ban to be lifted, possibly within the next six 
weeks. 
  "They've said in principle they're going to take it off. If 
I 
kept asking when, it won't progress anything. If I had to guess, 
I'd say between one week and six weeks," REUTERS quoted him as 
saying. 
  When asked if it was true that the ban would be lifted 
within 
six weeks Abu Hassan said: It's Needham's views." [passage 
omitted] 
  Dr. Mahathir had said last month that the Government was 
reviewing the ban following the removal of Andrew Neil, editor 
of London's SUNDAY TIMES, which was in the forefront of the 
attack against the [Pergau Dam] deal.

  [Text] Joint patrols between Indonesia and Singapore have 
led to a reduction of sea robberies in the Philip Channel and 
the Singapore Strait. From an average of 10 a month in 1992, it 
went down to nearly zero last year although there were a number 
of incidents close to or just outside the patrol area. This was 
revealed by the first Indosin Joint Coordinating Committee 
meeting held at Mindef [Ministry of Defense] today. 
  It was led by the assistant for operations to the chief of 
general staff of the Indonesian Armed Forces, Major General 
(Sofyan Affandi), and the SAF [Singapore Armed Forces] director 
of Joint Operations and Planning Directorate, Colonel Goh Yong 
Siang. The committee, which meets twice a year, discussed ways 
to make the patrols more effective through an exchange of 
information and pursuit of sea robbers across international 
boundaries.

<F P=106> [By Jakarta correspondent Paul Jacob] </F>
  [Text] Jakarta -- President Suharto yesterday defended the 
purchase of 39 former East German naval vessels for the 
Indonesian navy, saying that those who criticised the deal had 
little knowledge about its background. 
  Speaking at a ceremony marking the start of development of 
the Teluk Ratai naval base in southern Sumatra, he said 
Indonesia needed a strong and efficient naval force to patrol 
its vast waters and protect its economic exclusive zone. 
  "People who have less than full understanding and who 
presented their views have blurred the issue, caused divisions 
and suspicions which can affect stability," he said. 
  He warned that the government would not tolerate such 
manoeuvrings and would take firm action against such people, 
whom he did not identify. 
  The controversy stirred by the purchase of the vessels -- 
the 
cost was said to be US$1.1 billion [Singapore dollar] (S$1.65 
billion) -- has given an impression that there are divisions 
within the government between groups that are pro-and anti-Dr 
B.J. Habibie, the Research and Technology Minister. 
  He was entrusted by Mr Suharto to handle the purchase but 
critics, including Defence and Security Minister Edi Sudrajat, 
have described the US$1.1 billion figure as being excessive. 
  Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad told Parliament on Tuesday 
that the government was only allocating US$319 million for the 
purchase and refitting of the ships. 
  Dr Habibie has, however, defended the purchase and the cost 
though he accepted a slashing of the original US$1.1 billion 
budget he sought, which covered refurbishment and development of 
supporting facilities, such as bases. 
  In his remarks yesterday, Mr Suharto expressed support for 
both the purchase of the ships -- now put officially at US$482 
million -- and the establishment of the Teluk Ratai base, which 
is being developed to support the operations of the 39 vessels. 
  At Teluk Ratai in Lampung province, he also witnessed the 
official handing over of five of the vessels to the navy. 
  He said the government first heard about the availability of 
the vessels from private-sector sources. He then asked Dr 
Habibie to get more details about the ships and their 
availability. 
  This was because Dr Habibie "is well-known to officials and 
private businessmen in Germany. 
  "Because of that, the appointment of Dr Habibie to handle 
the 
deal should not be made an issue," he said.

  [Text] Ginanjar Kartasasmita, minister of state for 
national development planning and chairman of the National 
Development Planning Board, says the government's foreign debts 
up to 31 March 1994 reached U.S. $55 billion or 111 trillion 
rupiah. Out of that amount, U.S. $38.2 billion belonged to soft 
loans obtained from the Consultative Group for Indonesia [CGI], 
while non-CGI loans amounted to U.S. $16.8 billion. Minister 
Ginanjar Kartasasmita said this during a working meeting of 
House Commission X [Roman ten] in Jakarta this afternoon. The 
loans have almost entirely been used to finance projects in 
various sectors and development programs set by the government. 
The projects financed by the foreign loans are generally of 
high priority. According to Minister Ginanjar, 9.5 trillion 
rupiah of foreign aid has been earmarked for 655 projects during 
the 1994-95 fiscal year year.

  [Text] Jakarta, May 10 (OANA-ANTARA) -- The Foreign 
Ministry said on Friday that Foreign Minister Ali Alatas' 
condition has improved but he will undergo further treatment in 
Melbourne, Australia. 
  Through a statement, the Foreign Ministry said, Alatas had 
been doing some work from his bed since he was admitted to the 
Intensive Cardiac Care Unit (ICCU) of a Jakarta private hospital 
more than two weeks ago. 
  The minister is very much concerned with a rash of 
speculation on his health and has expressed his desire to meet 
with the mass media, it said. 
  "However the medical team attending him advised that he 
takes 
a complete rest," it said. 
  Alatas, 61, a key figure in the Nonaligned Movement (NAM) 
and 
in preparations for this year's summit of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC), was admitted to a Jakarta hospital 
on May 25 after complaining of stomach aches playing golf. 
  Officials said he had suffered a mild heart attack. 
  The Foreign Ministry also said Alatas will undergo further 
medical tests in Melbourne to look into the possibility he may 
have sclerosis. 
  Sources close to the Foreign Ministry said Alatas who is 
widely known as a hard-working chain smoker will leave for 
Melbourne either later on Friday or Saturday.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
opened two days of vice-ministerial bilateral talks Friday [10 
June] on further opening Japan's auto and auto parts markets. 
  Auto and auto parts are at the center of ongoing bilateral 
talks on a new trade framework through which Washington aims to 
pry open Japan's markets to rectify the chronic bilateral trade 
imbalance. 
  U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade 
Jeffrey Garten is leading the U.S. negotiating team, while 
Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice minister of international trade and 
industry for international affairs, and Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy 
foreign minister for economic affairs, are representing the 
Japanese side. 
  The negotiations follow working-level talks held in 
Washington last week when the two sides failed to iron out 
differences over "quantitative criteria" demanded by the U.S. as 
a way to measure progress in opening markets. 
  Japanese negotiators say the U.S. is not seeking binding 
targets, but it is still looking for quantitative standards on 
the number of dealers handling imported autos, and the import 
volume of autos and auto parts. They say Tokyo cannot accept 
any request that would bind any future action. 
  The U.S. first demanded "numerical targets" to measure 
progress in market access, but dropped the demands to revive the 
framework talks which had been stalled since February when then 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton 
failed to reach any market-opening agreements.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
confirmed Friday they will maximize efforts to write a framework 
on American access to Japan's auto markets at "the earliest 
possible time," a Japanese trade ministry official said. 
  Subcabinet-level auto trade talks between Sozaburo Okamatsu, 
vice international trade and industry minister for international 
affairs, and Jeffrey Garten, U.S. commerce undersecretary for 
international trade, were held in Tokyo "in an amicable 
atmosphere," the official told a press conference. 
  The two-hour discussion tackled the thorniest issue under 
the 
bilateral "framework" talks of setting "objective criteria" as a 
tool to gauge progress in the opening of Japan's auto and auto 
parts markets, the official said. 
  But both parties agreed to keep further details secret, he 
said. 
  No U.S. officials could be reached for comment on Friday's 
auto trade talks. 
  The latest meeting came after working-level auto trade talks 
in Washington last week, at which both parties agreed to suspend 
the issue of objective criteria. 
  The two countries remain at odds over the definition of the 
criteria, with Tokyo unlikely to accept any U.S. requests 
seeking future auto trade performance. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor recently proposed 
some indicators relating to future Japanese commitment, such as 
expanding the number of Japanese auto dealers handling U.S. 
cars, a yardstick Tokyo thinks as tantamount to "numerical 
targets." 
  The Japanese side has repeatedly said Tokyo is willing to 
respond only to indicators meant to measure past progress. 
  The Japanese official said the U.S. is now "in a favorable 
economic position" for settlement of the auto trade talks, 
citing strong earnings results enjoyed by the "big three" 
automakers. 
  The official said Okamatsu and Garten will informally meet 
again Saturday before the latter leaves Japan in the afternoon. 
  Friday's subcabinet-level meeting will be followed by 
working-level talks set for Monday and Tuesday in Tokyo, the 
official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
on Friday [10 June] reached a set of accords to promote 
bilateral cooperation in basic civil industrial technology, 
officials said. 
  The agreements center on development and dissemination of 
"precompetitive technologies," said Hiroshi Kashiwagi, the head 
of the industrial science and technology agency, an organization 
under the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
Kashiwagi briefed reporters on the talks, which were held in 
Japan. 
  Technological cooperation covered under the talks, the 
second 
of their kind, is part of the agenda set under the trade 
"framework" negotiations. The first round of talks were held in 
Washington last December. 
  Mary Good, U.S. undersecretary of commerce for technology, 
who headed the U.S. delegation, said, "I believe the agreement 
is going to lead to very substantial collaborative efforts in 
the areas where we have not cooperated before." 
  During the three days of high-level sessions -- Tuesday in 
Kyoto, and Thursday and Friday in Tokyo -- both parties agreed 
to launch a joint government-private sector campaign for 
enhancing the technological foundation of the two countries 
under the "industrial technology initiative" scheme. 
  The scheme will include an expanded interchange of 
researchers, financial assistance by Japan to major U.S. 
universities, and promoting information-sharing on publicly 
owned technological data. Under the scheme, Japan and the U.S. 
will also conduct joint research and development on about 10 
scientific themes that do not involve direct competition between 
the two countries, Kashiwagi said. 
  A research center, called "The Techno-Growth House," will be 
constructed in Japan to promote the scheme. The research house 
is designed to provide research space and accommodation at 
reasonable charges for foreign researchers. It can also be used 
for offices and conferences. 
  Kashiwagi said about 10 areas to be studied jointly will 
include database development for chemicals, environmental 
technology, know- how on measuring instruments, bioprocessing 
studies, ceramics, machinery technology and rare materials. 
  "We have chosen the areas which are of great interest both 
to 
Japan and the U.S.," Good said. She said studies on ceramics, 
bioprocessing and technical database may be launched by the end 
of this year. 
  Friday's accords will be formally announced in a joint 
statement to be made before the July Naples summit of the major 
industrial countries by Japanese International Trade and 
Industry Minister Eijiro Hata and U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron 
Brown. 
  The accords will be reflected in Japan-U.S. talks to find 
ways to promote economic harmonization in other areas of the 
trade framework talks, Kashiwagi said. The next round of 
high-level talks on civil industrial technology cooperation will 
be held in the U.S. in October.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Japan voiced regret Friday 
over China's underground nuclear test conducted earlier in the 
day. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada said in a 
statement it is "extremely regrettable" that China went on with 
the nuclear experiment despite other nuclear states' moratorium 
and when negotiations on a comprehensive test ban treaty is 
under way in Geneva. 
  Japan strongly urges China to never repeat nuclear tests, 
the 
statement said, and also called on other nuclear countries to 
continue refraining from conducting such tests. 
  The latest nuclear test was the first since last October and 
is believed to have been detonated at China's Lop Nor nuclear 
testing site in western China.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Japan protested to China on 
Friday [10 June] against its underground nuclear test earlier in 
the day and warned it could adversely affect Tokyo's economic 
assistance, now being detailed, Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Jiro Saito called Chinese Ambassador 
to 
Tokyo Xu Dunxin to his office and "strongly" protested the test, 
officials said. 
  Saito told Xu that Japan, the world's only country to have 
suffered atomic bombings, has especially strong feelings against 
nuclear testing and called on China not to repeat such tests in 
the interest of bilateral relations, the officials said. 
  Another senior ministry official took similar action in a 
separate meeting with a Chinese embassy minister, voicing 
concern that such a test would have an undesirable effect on 
Tokyo's effort to win understanding and support of the Japanese 
people toward economic assistance for China, they said. 
  It was an indirect reference to Japan's fourth package of 
yen 
credits pledged to China. The two countries are currently 
identifying projects to be financed by the loans. 
  Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa will also urge 
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen during their meeting in 
Beijing on Sunday to refrain from nuclear tests, the officials 
said. 
  Earlier Friday, ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada issued a 
statement in which he called the Chinese test "extremely 
regrettable."

  [Text] Washington, June 9 KYODO -- The Japanese Embassy on 
Thursday issued a rebuttal of an article published in the NEW 
YORK TIMES the same day claiming Japan was reluctant to levy 
sanctions against North Korea over its alleged nuclear weapons 
program. "The article is not accurate," the embassy said in a 
rebuttal statement. 
  The Seoul-datelined dispatch reported that despite its 
public 
agreement with the United States on "any sanctions imposed," 
Tokyo, according to officials, has been arguing in private 
against Washington's plan. The report quoted a senior Japanese 
official as saying, "stopping the remittances of funds is a very 
heavy sanction. Our differences are over the weight of the 
sanctions and the timing." 
  The TIMES quoted another senior Japanese official as saying 
that Japan and the U.S. have a different view of the money 
transmitted by Koreans in Japan to North Korea. "They 
(Americans) see this money as something that props up the North 
Korean Government. We see it as largely something from Koreans 
in Japan who want to help their families," the Japanese official 
was quoted as saying. 
  The TIMES story also said: "Combined with China's reluctance 
to exert greater pressure on North Korea, the sharp debate 
between Tokyo and Washington threatens to greatly reduce the 
pain inflicted on the government of (North Korean President) Kim 
Il-song." 
  The embassy said in its rebuttal it was "the shared view" 
among Japan, the U.S. and South Korea is that "the international 
community should, through the UN Security Council, urgently 
consider an appropriate response, including sanctions. There 
are no differences between the U.S. and Japan on this matter." 
The embassy statement also said, "Japan will respond in a 
responsible manner within its constitution, should the UN 
Security Council adopt measures, including sanctions." 
  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, appearing 
before a hearing in a House panel, dismissed the reported rift 
between Tokyo and Washington.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa will visit South Korea and China on Saturday [11 June] 
and Sunday to hold talks with his counterparts on North Korea's 
alleged development of nuclear weapons, the Foreign Ministry 
announced Friday. 
  Kakizawa will visit Seoul on Saturday to hold talks with 
South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and meet South Korean 
President Kim Yong-sam. On Sunday, he will leave Seoul for 
Beijing for talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. 
Talks with the South Korean and Chinese foreign ministers are 
likely to focus on the situation concerning Pyongyang's 
suspected nuclear development, ministry officials said. 
  In Seoul, Kakizawa and Han are expected to discuss how to 
deal with the situation based on the consultations last weekend 
among Japan, South Korea and the United States, they said. 
South Korea may brief Kakizawa on Kim's visit to Russia and 
Uzbekistan and Han's visit to New York and Beijing, they said. 
But Kakizawa and Han will not be discussing the specifics of 
possible sanctions against Pyongyang, they said. The foreign 
ministers will also discuss other international and bilateral 
affairs. They will also discuss the summit meeting of the Group 
of Seven (G-7) economic powers in July in Naples, Italy. 
  In Beijing, Kakizawa hopes to reach a common acknowledgment 
with China that the current situation regarding North Korea is 
very critical. Japan is likely to voice its expectations of 
China's persuading Pyongyang to change its position. China has 
repeatedly said it wants to solve the problem through dialogue 
by taking more time and is against imposing sanctions.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
on Friday [10 June] reconfirmed the importance of seeking 
China's influence in solving the North Korean nuclear issue, 
Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  Peter Tarnoff, U.S. undersecretary of state for political 
affairs, agreed with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa on the need 
to make efforts to seek China's agreement to solve the problem 
diplomatically, the officials said. 
  Turning to bilateral trade relations, Kakizawa told Tarnoff 
in a 15-minute meeting he has had close contact with U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor and he wants to make the trade 
"framework" talks successful based on mutual trust. 
  Tarnoff said he hopes progress will be made in the trade 
talks, noting the importance of coordination between Japan and 
the U.S. on a wide range of issues, including political and 
security matters. 
  Tarnoff arrived for talks in Japan Thursday and is scheduled 
to meet Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda later in the day 
before leaving for Seoul.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
reconfirmed Friday that Japan, the U.S. and South Korea should 
maintain close contact in tackling the crisis over North Korea's 
alleged nuclear program, Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Peter 
Tarnoff, in separate meetings with Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa and Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda, also shared 
the view with Japan that China's role is important in solving 
the problem, according to the officials. 
  During a 15-minute meeting, Tarnoff and Kakizawa agreed on 
the need to seek China's agreement to solve the issue 
diplomatically, they said. 
  In a subsequent meeting, Tarnoff and Fukuda agreed to 
continue to work toward a peaceful solution while seeking 
international coordination. 
  They reaffirmed an accord reached among Tokyo, Seoul and 
Washington last weekend that the U.N. Security Council should 
"urgently" consider action against North Korea for its refusal 
to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), 
they said. 
  Tarnoff told Fukuda that the visit to North Korea by former 
U.S. President Jimmy Carter is in response to an invitation by 
Pyongyang and that he will be making the trip as a private 
citizen. 
  He did not say whether the U.S. Government is asking Carter 
to deliver a message to Pyongyang, they said. 
  Tarnoff arrived in Japan on Thursday for talks with Japanese 
officials on political and security matters. He is to leave 
Tokyo for Seoul on Friday evening. 
  In the nearly two-hours of talks followed by a luncheon 
meeting, Tarnoff and Fukuda discussed a wide range of 
international topics, including Russia, Vietnam, Cambodia, China 
and Haiti, the officials said. 
  While pointing out that it is too early to predict 
Washington's future relations with China after extending the 
most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status, Tarnoff said the U.S. 
wants to promote ties with China. 
  He voiced U.S. support for Japan's stance in seeking 
normalization of ties with Russia based on the Tokyo declaration 
adopted when Russian President Boris Yeltsin visited Japan last 
October, they said. 
  Turning to Vietnam, Fukuda welcomed the improvement of ties 
between Washington and Hanoi.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa said Friday he will urge China to cooperate in 
implementing measures which may be imposed by the UN Security 
Council against North Korea over its alleged nuclear weapons 
development. 
  At a press conference after a cabinet meeting, Kakizawa said 
he will make the request when he meets Chinese Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen in Beijing on Sunday. He also said he will call for 
Beijing's influence in persuading Pyongyang to change its stance. 
  In talks between Qian and South Korean Foreign Minister Han 
Sung- chu on Thursday, China refused to endorse sanctions as a 
means of breaking the deadlock over North Korea's suspected 
nuclear development. Kakizawa, who will visit South Korea on 
Saturday prior to his China trip, said he will ask Han about the 
details of his talks with Qian.

  [Text] Vienna, June 11 (AFP) -- Two new inspectors from 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported Saturday 
that they were in Pyongyang despite North Korean threats to 
expel them, IAEA spokesman David Kyd said. 
  "Everything is normal and there is no indication that they 
will [be] obliged to leave North Korea," they told the IAEA's 
Vienna headquarters by telephone, Kyd said. 
  Yun Ho Jin, spokesman for Pyongyang's Vienna embassy, said 
Friday North Korea would take "adequate retaliatory measures" 
following an earlier IAEA vote to suspend technical aid to North 
Korea in an escalating row over North Korea's refusal to allow 
adequate inspection of its nuclear facilities. 
  Earlier it was reported that an IAEA inspector had been 
expelled from North Korea and arrived in Beijing. 
  The inspector, Vladimir Rukhlo, was in fact returning to 
Vienna after completing a tour of duty and had been replaced. 
The other team member, Jamaluddin Omar, returned to Vienna 
Tuesday following a death in the family. 
  Yun said that North Korea's retaliatary measures could 
include the expulsion of IAEA inspectors from North Korea, a ban 
on all verification procedures and a possible withdrawal of 
North Korea from the IAEA and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty. 
  However, no official message had reached the IAEA 
headquarters midday Saturday and the atomic agency did not 
expect any official reaction from North Korea before early next 
week, Kyd said. 
  Any retaliation by Pyongyang could harden the position of 
the 
UN Security Council which is expected to vote in the next few 
days on whether or not to invoke sanctions against North Korea. 
  The IAEA's two new inspectors arrived in North Korea at the 
start of last week to replace their colleagues who had been 
there since mid-May, observing the downloading of the 5-megawatt 
Yongbyon experimental nuclear reactor but without being allowed 
to take samples. 
  Fewer than 10 of some 8,000 used nuclear fuel rods remained 
to be downloaded Friday, the outgoing inspector reported, Kyd 
said. 
  The IAEA and Washington believe that Pyongyang has 
restricted 
the inspection of the reactor in order to conceal the diversion 
of nuclear material to an atomic weapons programme. 
  IAEA director general Hans Blix last week told the UN 
Security Council that with 68 percent of the rods downloaded, 
the agency was unable to verify whether or not nuclear material 
had been diverted.

  [Text] Former Prime Minister Anan Panyarachun urged leaders 
in the Asia Pacific region to accelerate the process of regional 
economic integration under the framework of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum to achieve broader regionwide 
liberalization and to provide political leadership towards free 
trade at the global level. 
  Speaking at a conference on "Pacific Trade and Investment: 
Options for the 90's," Anan, who initiated the Asean Free Trade 
Area (Afta), said he inclined to disagree with more cautious 
views of the future role of Apec. "I would urge our leaders to 
be bolder in hastening the process of regional economic 
integration," he said. 
  Anan, the Afta architect, spoke from Canada where he was 
receiving the honourary degree from Queen's University. He 
said, "Vision is not really the issue here anymore, since market 
forces and past successes have already shown the way." 
  Thailand and Canada are both members of Apec, the grouping 
of 
17 Asia Pacific nations whose leaders are scheduled to have the 
second meeting in Indonesia later this year to determine the 
future course of the group. 
  Anan viewed that the past patterns of vertically-integrated 
production relations seem now to be giving way to more equal 
business partnerships, characterized by horizontal 
interdependence. In other words, economic convergence between 
developed countries and the NIEs [newly industrializing 
economies] and emerging NIEs will mean that the latter two 
groups represent distinct sets of investment and market 
opportunities fed by the economies of China and Indochina. 
  Anan also predicted that while the world's economies will 
become more integrated, the financial services sector will 
continue to be an area of expanding opportunities in the Apec 
region. He said, "I also observe that the rapidly expanding 
investment needs, in both the private and public sectors of 
developing Apec economies, will generate enormous opportunities 
for trade and technology transfer in financing services. By 
their nature, financial services will be those that are most 
characteristically global." 
  "I foresee that the financial services sector, which has 
already grown significantly in recent years, will continue to be 
an area of expanding opportunity in the Apec region. Capital 
mobility, especially in the Asia Pacific, is linking regional 
financial markets in an unprecedented manner," he said.

<F P=106> [By Keiji Urakami] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- The Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) has embarked on redefining 
its role in response to changing situations in the world 
following the end of the Cold War. 
  During the just-ended annual ministerial meeting in Paris, 
the world's 25 major industrial countries clarified their 
resolve to transform an entity that serves merely as a think 
tank for the rich nations' club into more of a bridge with newly 
emerging economies. 
  "An open, creative and dynamic OECD can help enlarge the 
community of free and prosperous nations throughout the world," 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said during the 
two-day session which ended Wednesday [8 June]. 
  "The opportunity is there," Christopher said in a speech 
that 
won instant applause from foreign and trade ministers from the 
25 countries. 
  This year's ministerial meeting, the 33rd of its kind since 
1973, took up "the role of the Paris-based OECD in an evolving 
world" as one of the three key topics. 
  Christopher's sense of urgency in charting a new course for 
the OECD was echoed in a joint communique issued at the end of 
the Paris gathering, which proposed reinforcing links with 
nonmember countries, especially Asian and former communist bloc 
countries, for their eventual integration into the global 
economic system. 
  The OECD said in the communique that the group should "build 
up contact, dialogue and cooperation" with nonmembers which it 
says are "gaining relevance in the world economy and are basing 
their development on market principles, pluralist democracy and 
respect for human rights, as the OECD countries have long done." 
  The communique underscored the need for the OECD to extend 
its links, especially to newly emerging economies like China and 
South Korea and former communist bloc nations struggling to 
shift to a market-oriented economy, such as Poland and Hungary. 
  The OECD supported South Korea's bid to join the body in 
1996, noting the country is taking part in a number of 
activities "on the same footing as member countries." 
  The OECD also said it will deepen policy dialogue with 
China, 
which was described in the communique as "a leading player in 
the world economy." 
  After the close of the ministerial meeting, the OECD signed 
a 
cooperation pact with Russia, aimed at smoothing its shift to a 
market economy through an increased flow of assistance from the 
OECD. 
  Russia's integration with the West could be "the best 
investment we can make in our security and in the security of 
all the peoples of Europe," Christopher said. 
  The communique's emphasis on deepening ties with nonmembers 
came after the OECD club opened its door to Mexico as the 25th 
member a few weeks ago for the first time in more than two 
decades. 
  The OECD, created in 1961 as a replacement for the 
organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC), has 
served as a catalyst for reconstruction of war-devastated Europe 
under the Marshall Plan concept. 
  "With European countries as core members, the OECD has often 
been described as a rich man's club," Akira Hirata, a researcher 
at the OECD Development Center, said. 
  Hirata said the function of the OECD has thus been limited 
to 
policy coordination only among advanced nations, leaving the 
task of promoting dialogue with nonmembers to suborgans like the 
Development Assistance Committee (DAC). 
  "But such a cozy state of relations within the club has 
changed in recent years," he said, citing the demise of the 
Soviet Union and the collapse of the communist bloc. 
  "Ties with nonmember countries have gradually played a 
bigger 
role," Hirata said, ascribing the trend to Asian countries' 
explosive economic growth to "levels that cannot be negligible 
under the global economic management." 
  The OECD may justify increased links with nonmembers by 
saying it could economically benefit from ties with countries 
having huge growth potential, Hirata said. 
  Asia, for example, was termed "the growth center in the 
world 
economy" by the 1994 Japanese white paper on economic 
cooperation. 
  "There is also an argument that leaving developing countries 
unattended would only help boost a flow of illegal immigrants to 
advanced countries, eventually heightening social and political 
instability there," Hirata said. 
  Some OECD ministers like Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring 
cautioned against the OECD's adopting too quick an approach to 
developing countries like China, however. 
  Spring cited China's poor human rights record as an example. 
  Leon Brittan, the trade chief of the European Union (EU), 
said, "we must not so widen our membership that our work becomes 
shallow." 
  Mexico's admission met criticism from some OECD countries 
which claimed Mexican industries are not advanced enough to be 
eligible for the OECD club.

  [Text] Rangoon, June 13 (AFP) -- The Burmese military 
overran two base camps of the Shan state warlord Khun Sa at the 
weekend, killing at least 32 guerrillas and losing 17 of their 
own men, the New Light of Myanmar newspaper said Monday. 
  News of the assault Saturday in Burma's eastern Shan state 
had been preceded by a campaign in the official press denouncing 
Khun Sa as a drug-runner and a "murderous terrorist." 
  If a person found in possession of just 15 grams of heroin 
deserves the death sentence, then Khun Sa, who deals in hundreds 
of tons of drugs, deserves the death sentence more than 100 
times over, the paper said. 
  The report said the military also had 31 wounded in the 
attack on camps where 600 of Khun Sa's Muang Tai Army (MTA) 
fighters were based. 
  The military seized 47 weapons, 199 mines, 304 hand 
grenades, 
53 mortar rounds, 53 assorted rockets, 7,800 rounds of 
ammunition and other equipment as well as 3.5 pounds (1.6 
kilograms) of marijuana, the daily said. 
  Lieutenant General Tin Oo, the army chief of staff and 
commander of the No.1 bureau of special operations, had visited 
the area from June 9 to 11 to encourage front-line troops, the 
paper said. 
  In the continuing press campaign, an article Monday 
described 
Khun Sa's nationalist pose as "media hype." 
  "He is a mere criminal ... and his group is also a mere drug 
ring or a murderous terrorist group," the article said.

  [text]-Yangon, 17 May - A Tatmadaw column of the Eastern 
Command, acting on information, seized 3333.96 litres of acetic 
anhydride, used in refining heroin, from about 60 members of 
Khun Sa's SURA armed group after a 20-minute engagement with 
them on 13 May near Wunlon Village in Loilem Township. 
  The acid was in 126 containers. 
  The Tatmadaw column also impounded 62 pack-saddles from the 
armed group which fled in disarray after the battle. The seized 
acid is believed to be destined for opium refineries of Khun 
Sa's armed group, which are situated on the Myanmar-Thai border. 
  Acetic anhydride is an essential element in refining heroin. 
A kilo or a litre of the liquid is needed for producing a kilo 
of heroin. 
  Over 4,000 litres of acetic anhydride were also seized 
together with culprits from a truck which parked at Yayayekwin 
Ward, Taunggyi on 15 November last year. The acid was on its 
way to refineries of Khun Sa's Loimaw armed group, notorious for 
their drug trafficking and opium refining, which is their main 
business. 
  A Tatmadaw column of Eastern Command while on security duty 
also seized another 415.8 litres and nine horses/mules from a 
caravan on 5 December 1992 when they found a group of smugglers 
heading for the border near Narpaw Village in Kengtung Township. 
  The Tatmadaw and people's Police Force members are exposing 
and arresting drug smugglers who are trying to transport 
precursor chemicals to Khun Sa's SUA/SURA armed groups which are 
hiding on the Myanmar-Thai border. 
  The security personnel are also crushing the SUA/SURA group 
who are selling their refined heroin on international drug 
market.

Government will fund Malaysia with U.S. $10 million per year for 
a period of five years. Minister of Science, Technology, and 
Environment Datuk Law Hieng Ding signed on behalf of Malaysia, 
while the Danish minister of environment, Mr. Svend Auken, 
signed for his government in Kuala Lumpur. 
  Speaking to newsmen, Datuk Law said the Danish cooperation 
for environment and development, or (?Dance) program, had 
identified three major projects. These include the national 
coastal zone management plan, the establishment of Institute of 
Environmental Studies, and Institute of Environmental Technology 
and Management. Datuk Law said once the project is completed, 
the technology developed would be shared with other countries in 
the region. 
  Meanwhile, the Danish environment minister said the 
hazardous 
waste collection system, to be constructed in Penang, will 
become a model for similar system in the region. It is expected 
to be implemented in Thailand and Vietnam as well.

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- President Suharto yesterday spoke in 
defense of the big businesses which dominate Indonesian 
industry, saying that their critics overlook the major benefits 
they bring to the country. 
  Speaking to about 140 students of cooperative ownership at 
his Tapos ranch near here, Suharto said Indonesian big business 
provides the capital and management which neither the government 
nor the cooperatives can muster, to build some of the giant 
projects necessary for development. 
  "You didn't expect us to wait until we're capable to carry 
out the projects did you?" he asked his visitors during a dialog. 
  He said critics tend to look at the ownerships of these 
businesses but completely ignore the benefits they bring, in 
terms of products, employment and taxes. 
  "Surely they must have been beneficial. I can't believe that 
they have not," he said citing the examples of textiles and 
cement industries in which Indonesia has become self sufficient. 
  "Let's not look at who owns these corporations. Without them 
we'd still be dependent on imports," he said. "The plants 
create job opportunities and if they are profitable, then they 
are paying taxes." 
  He gave assurances that the government will make sure that 
big corporations will not be allowed to hold monopolies. "We 
have ways of doing this," he said. 
  Suharto cautioned against people demanding the enactment of 
an anti-monopoly law, because the constitution acknowledges that 
monopolies are permissible if controlled by the government with 
the intention of bringing benefits "to as many people as 
possible." 
  The President however stressed that the government remains 
committed to the development of cooperatives, which the 
constitution regards as one of the country's three economic 
pillars along with public and private enterprises. 
  It is the task of the cooperative's managers to strengthen 
their positions before they can be entrusted with big projects, 
he said. 
  He said while the constitution allows for the government to 
acquire anything in the name of the people, there is no plan for 
the government to attempt to control everything the way 
communist countries do. 
  The group of cooperatives students were the latest guests to 
Suharto's ranch, itself often the subject of criticism and 
gossip, as the President himself acknowledges. 
  He said critics often portrayed the ranch as a luxury place 
with a palace, helipad, a swimming pool and a golf course. 
  He said the pool is actually a pond where the cattle drink, 
the golf course is grazing land and the helipad is actually a 
place where the ranch operators dry coffee and cocoa seeds. 
  The palace is actually a Joglo (traditional Javanese house) 
which he said he bought at an auction after an exhibition in 
Jakarta. 
  The President was accompanied during the tour of the ranch 
by 
Minister of Cooperatives Subiakto Tjakrawerdaya, Minister of 
Youth Affairs and Sports Hayono Isman and acting rector of the 
Pajajaran University Tanwir Mukawi. 
  During the question and answer session, a manager of a 
student cooperative in East Kalimantan queried the President's 
initiative to compel companies to hand over up to a fifth of 
their equity to cooperatives, saying that after the initial 
massive publicity, the plan has stopped dead in its tracks. 
  Suharto responded that the initiative was still much alive 
but that there are problems. 
  "It needs more time," he said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Facing the Events That Flare Up To Turn Into </F>
Issues"] 
  [Text] In the remaining years of the first 25-year 
long-term development master plan (PJP I) it was predicted that 
the challenges and dynamics that Indonesia faces under the 
second 25-year long term development plan (PJP II) will not be 
totally the same as those it encountered under PJP I. The 
people's aspirations also will change. The prediction proved to 
be quite true because we recently saw the emergence of several 
events on the national scene. 
  To cite an example, a series of events took place over the 
last two months. These events, which eventually turned into 
national issues, were putting us under a kind of pressure and 
were also worrisome. As a matter of fact, they can disrupt 
national unity and cohesion. Nobody seemed to know the 
perpetrators of the events or what their objectives were. 
However, it is apparent that these events are destructive to 
the people, the public order, and the country if they are not 
completely prevented from turning into sensitive issues. 
  The allegation that the government was planning to shorten 
the retirement age for civil servants and to replace the 
leadership of the Functional Group faction in the House of 
Representatives were among the several issues that cropped up. 
The government formally had put an end to such rumors. The 
other issues concerned the liquidation of the Summa Bank's 
assets, the unpaid bank loans by 50 conglomerate companies, and 
the wish by professionals to create the ICKI [Association of 
Indonesian Nationalist Intellectuals]. The people who were 
involved in these issues were clamoring for support from 
President Suharto. The ICKI was dissolved even before it 
materialized. 
  Prior to the press briefing by Murdiono, minister/state 
secretary, on the extension of General Feisal Tanjung's service 
as the commander of the Republic of Indonesia Armed Forces 
[ABRI], all sorts of speculation about the armed forces' top 
leadership were made by ABRI personnel at headquarters in 
Cilangkap. The unpleasant issue spreading at that time was that 
the ABRI is divided into factions. This is a very dangerous 
issue. 
  The above-mentioned issues were only those that the public 
could gain access to through mass media reports. These did not 
include the rumors and gossip that spread nationwide about the 
mass protests and demonstrations taking place here and there in 
the country. Such issues are worrisome. If they are not 
immediately resolved, they can disrupt the national stability 
that we thus far have struggled very hard to achieve. 
  It is not easy to know for sure the causes that led to the 
recent flare up of issues in the country. A special in-depth 
study of events is required to determine the causes. If we base 
our theory on the experience of several developing countries, 
such issues normally flare up when several existing institutions 
remain frozen, their functions are reduced, or they become 
defunct. Some institutions were granted a status quo position. 
As a matter of fact, all kinds of gossip and rumors became the 
daily menu [preceding word in English] while politicians were 
still facing obstacles in their efforts to reach a consensus to 
resolve the issues constitutionally. 
  It is possible for issues to develop when the bureaucracy is 
obviously inefficient and is bogged down with the inability to 
make collective decisions on state matters. In a situation 
where there is no full guarantee for human rights protection and 
when economic disparity is widening, there will be more 
opportunities for the people to spread rumors about anything and 
everything. 
  Generally, such a situation only will benefit a group of 
people such as those with a specific political ideology, "the 
annoyed people's front", and other movements that reject 
establishment. 
  On the other hand, the rapid social development and the 
advancement of modern science and technology, which is affected 
by the currents of globalization, will add greater dynamism to 
the unsteady situation. We will see the emergence of a period 
of transition or national instability in this situation. 
Usually such a period also will provide the opportunity for 
several issues to develop. Ironically, they attract the 
people's attention. 
  As we already know, our entry into the PJP II simultaneously 
marked the beginning of the take-off process in our efforts to 
upgrade the quality of our people from a developing agrarian 
society to a modern and industrialized society. The process of 
ugrading our society can also be called the transitional period. 
Several kinds of issues always spread in a transitional period. 
  The matter to be decided now is, on one hand, the effort to 
create concrete measures to be taken to prevent the conflicting 
issues from spreading; and, on the other, to prevent the people 
from being trapped by such issues. 
  Edi Sudrajat, minister of defense and security, has stressed 
repeatedly the significance of upholding the very foundation of 
the unitary republic and the need for the people to fully 
understand nationalism in the Republic of Indonesia, which has 
been handed down by the founders of the republic. This is 
important regarding the idea that Indonesia will be a strong 
country if all the various components that make up the nation 
are strong. The modernization trend can cause a nation that is 
not very strong to stumble into the process of disintegration 
and it finally will divide the nation and create disunity among 
the people.

<F P=106> ["Communique of the Provisional National Commission Against </F>
the Second U.S. War of Aggression in Cambodia"; dated 5 June] 
  [Text] Since May 1st, when we announced the establishment 
of the Provisional National Commission Against the Second U.S. 
War of Aggression in Cambodia, we have received a succession of 
letters, particularly from students, teachers, professors, civil 
servants, soldiers, farmers, and traders in various provinces 
and districts of our Cambodia. These letters have welcomed and 
voiced support for the establishment of our Commission and have 
exposed and demonstrated the bad consequences of the previous 
U.S. war of aggression and the consequences that will result 
from the continued fueling of the communist Vietnamese 
aggressors' war by the U.S. Administration in Cambodia. 
  Our Commission has been greatly encouraged by this vigorous 
support. The commission would like to issue this communique 
summing up the essence of these letters. 
  1. What were the tremendously destructive effects and what 
was the nature of the suffering that resulted from the first 
U.S. war of aggression? 
  The first U.S. war of aggression in Cambodia lasted from 
March 1970 to April 1975. This war was a large-scale one 
involving land, naval, and air forces, and artillery, including 
the forces of [late Cambodian general] Lon Nol and (Thieu-Ky) 
[former South Vietnamese leader]. Then, the entire Cambodian 
territory was the victim of bullets, shells, and all sorts of 
bombs dropped from aircraft. Some of the bombs weighed up to 
1,000 kilograms and made craters as big as ponds and reservoirs. 
Some bombs damaged the soil, as for example in Ratanakiri, 
Mondolkiri, Kratie, Kompong Cham, Kandal, Takeo, and Kampot. To 
this day these craters remain visible. 
  Furthermore, hundreds of thousands of oxen and buffaloes, 
the 
farmers' livelihood, were killed by bullets and shells. The 
United States used B-52, B-57, F-105, F-4, F-111, OV-10, L-24, 
C-130, C- 121, DC-3, and DC-7 aircraft, and all types of 
helicopters, to drop various kinds of bombs, which destroyed 
entire villages, property, water jars, plates, cooking pans, 
fish paste, and salt. Everything was destroyed. Forests in 
eastern Cambodia, such as in Ratanakiri, Mondolkiri, Kratie, 
Stung Treng, and Kompong Cham were razed and transformed into 
open fields. Some trees were damaged, shattered, or pierced 
through. Thousands of cubic meters of timber were destroyed. 
People fled their houses and villages to avoid aircraft; they 
lived in the forest and were affected by malaria and fever. The 
health of tens of thousands of people was affected; these people 
are still suffering. Consequently, the children of these people 
were also affected with limb disability, blindness, and neurotic 
diseases. Apart from this, tens of thousands of our people 
died; and hundreds of thousands more were disabled in provinces 
in eastern Cambodia as well as in the central part of the 
country and in areas around Phnom Penh city. 
  Women, men, adolescents, babies, and elderly people all 
suffered from this savage U.S. war. Some have become abnormal 
due to the effects on their brains, nerves, and body. All this 
was the result of the U.S. reliance on the strength of its war 
machine to kill the Cambodian nation and people. Nobody forgets 
this; no Cambodian forgets this -- neither do the land, rivers, 
lakes, ponds, forests, and hills. The results are permanently 
engraved and will be visible everywhere for generations. 
  2. Another bad consequence of the U.S. Administration's 
involvement in the communist Vietnamese aggressors' war of 
aggression in Cambodia was the deaths of American people. 
  The United States interference in Cambodia now comes on top 
of the communist Vietnamese aggressors' war in the form of 
military advisers and specialists, and through the supply of 
tanks, aircraft, and ammunition. This amounts to a declaration 
of war. Later on, more military advisers, specialists, or U.S. 
troops will be directly involved in various ways or on different 
battlefields in Cambodia. Later on, the United States will send 
500, 1,000, or 5,000 soldiers to Cambodia, saying that these 
troops are for protecting U.S. experts and advisers. In fact, 
these troops will come to participate directly in the fighting 
in Cambodia. 
  Now that the United States has dispatched advisers to wage 
war to kill the Cambodian nation and people, the problem is 
this: Will U.S. soldiers be killed or not; will they be wounded 
or not? No one can be certain about this because a war is the 
fighting among warring parties. If you have come to kill 
others, other people also have the right to defend themselves. 
If the United States has a lot of weapons and can kill 100 or 
1,000 Cambodians on each battlefield, some U.S. soldiers will 
unavoidably be killed or wounded, from a few to a dozen. If the 
war continues, more Cambodians and increasing numbers of 
Americans will be killed. 
  This is the law of war: if you play with fire, you will be 
burned. The Cambodian people do not want war, neither do the 
American people. This is certain. 
  Therefore, on this occasion, the Cambodian people in all 
circles would like to appeal to the United States, which loves 
peace, justice, and mankind, not to let Americans die in vain in 
Cambodia. The American people have clearly understood the bad 
consequences of the military involvements of previous U.S. 
Administrations. 
  1. War sowed great destruction for the Cambodian nation 
and people, who have suffered for 15 years from the Vietnamese 
aggressors' war. 
  2. War will kill Cambodians as well as Americans, if the 
U.S. Administration ventures into and get involved in the 
communist Vietnamese's war in Cambodia. 
  3. The Cambodian and American people, who love peace and 
justice, want peace and not death. The two peoples want to have 
peaceful and friendly relations. 
  This is the profound request of both the Cambodian and 
American people. The Cambodian and American people should 
cooperate to prevent the U.S. Administration from sending troops 
to fight in Cambodia through any means -- whether through 
military advisers and experts, aircraft pilots, or those who 
repair roads and bridges for transporting troops and war 
equipment. These persons will all be involved in war. 
  We hold that the American people, like the Cambodian people, 
want peace and peaceful and friendly relations. We repeatedly 
appeal for the use of peace and friendship to solve the 
Cambodian problem. This way is a thousand millions times better 
than fueling the war. Involvement in war is a thousand millions 
times worse than ending it. The Cambodian people and the 
American people want peace and are totally opposed to war. 
  [Dated] Phnom Penh, 5 June 1994 
  [Signed] The Provisional National Commission Against the 
U.S. War of Aggression in Cambodia

<F P=106> ["Statement of the Royal Government of the Kingdom of </F>
Cambodia"; dated 11 June -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] After receiving a statement dated 10 June from His 
Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king of the Kingdom of 
Cambodia [KOC], in which His Majesty expressed concern over the 
continued destruction and bloodshed in the KOC, the Royal 
Government of Cambodia [RGC] would like to issue the following 
statement for national and international public opinion: 
  The RGC voices its support for this statement by His 
Majesty. 
This is because the continued massacre, sabotage, and 
destruction of the national and people's property are the causes 
for the losses of property and human lives and a major obstacle 
hindering the process for national reconciliation and for the 
nation's restoration and reconstruction. 
  The RGC also wants to recall that it has all along displayed 
genuine goodwill in pursuing the policy of peace and national 
reconciliation of His Majesty the King, especially his superb 
initiatives to bring about an immediate end to the massacre in 
Cambodia. The RGC has always expressed its support for all the 
superb ideas of His Majesty the King, particularly the king's 
proposals and pleas for a complete, immediate, permanent, 
irreversible, and unconditional cease-fire throughout the 
country. 
  But unfortunately, the Khmer Rouge obstinately have refused 
to abandon their strategy to prolong the war and have continued 
to massacre, menace, and destroy the peaceful life of the 
Cambodian people. 
  The Khmer Rouge have resorted to all schemes and means and 
raised all sorts of illegitimate and unreasonable proposals and 
arguments, which run counter to the wish of the Cambodians and 
world community, in an attempt to hinder His Majesty the King's 
lofty ideas for peace and national reconciliation and unity, 
particularly his proposal made at the roundtable meeting held in 
Chhanghsu-on Palace on 27 and 28 May 1994 calling for a 
complete, immediate, and irreversible cease-fire on the spot to 
be observed everywhere on 15 June, beginning at noon. 
  Firmly adhering to the spirit of love for peace and national 
reconciliation of the RGC and the people throughout the country, 
the RGC fervently expresses its desire for the coming roundtable 
meeting on 15 June to achieve success in bringing about a clear 
specification on the schedule for a complete, immediate, 
on-the-spot, and permanent cease-fire.

  [Summary] A government official revealed that the Royal 
Government of Cambodia [RGC] and the Khmer Rouge have already 
chosen their representatives to the roundtable commission. The 
four representatives from the RGC are: "Sok An, Tol Loah, Yu 
Hokkri, and Chhuo Leanghuot." But this official did not confirm 
whether there will be any change in this composition before the 
commission's scheduled meeting is held in Phnom Penh on 15 June 
under the chairmanship of Samdech Chakkrei Nhoek Chulong. The 
roundtable commission delegation from the Party of Democratic 
Kampuchea [PDK] will arrive in Phnom Penh on 13 June to attend 
the meeting. 
  According to a report on 10 June by the CAMBODIAN DAILY in 
English, the four PDK delegates on the commission will be chosen 
from among the following six officials: "Chan Youran, Mak Ben, 
Tep Khunnal, Tup Kiem, Meas Chey, and Sok Roeu." 
  The topics on the agenda are: 
  1) The answer from both sides on whether they will or will 
not accept a permanent cease-fire in Cambodia. 
  2) The PDK's proposal on the minimal policy program. 
  Various analysts have expressed doubts that the 15 June 
meeting will be successful because the Pyongyang roundtable 
failed despite the fact that it was chaired by the king himself.

    [Editorial Report] Phnom Penh REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA in 
Cambodian on 11 June carries a 650-word item saying that 
"according to a report, a government for national salvation will 
be set up to replace the current royal government." The report 
quotes a "high-ranking official in the royal government" as 
saying that "Samdech Sihanouk will become head of state with 
power and the throne left to his son" and that "this new 
government, called the national salvation government, will be 
led by a prime minister who is a neutral personality." The 
paper adds that there is as yet no clear indication as to who 
would be the candidate for the post of prime minister. The 
paper goes on to say that analysts consider this plan a ploy to 
create further confusion and an attempt to revive the almost 
doomed roundtable talks. 
  The paper concludes by saying: "Although there is no 
official reaction yet from the two Samdech Prime Ministers, it 
is believed that the sole reason for this plan is to bring the 
Khmer Rouge into this new government! And it is certain that 
the royal government will not accept this plan. It is still 
remembered that students and the association of monks from 
Kampuchea Kraom [former Cambodian territory now part of southern 
Vietnam] recently demanded to stage a demonstration to hand over 
power to the king; however, this demand was thwarted."

  [Excerpts] Vientiane, June 10 (KPL) -- Lao President Nouhak 
Phoumsavan yesterday evening hosted a banquet at the National 
Assembly Hall in honour of the visiting Myanmar [Burma] SLORC 
[State Law and Order Restoration Council] Chairman Senior 
General Than Shwe and his party. 
  President Nouhak Phoumsavan and Senior Gen. Than Shwe 
exchanged a toast at the banquet, both appreciating the 
increasingly growing relationship and cooperation between the 
two neighboring countries. [passage omitted on President Nouhak 
Phoumsavanh's speech] 
  Senior Gen. Than Shwe also described the fruit of the 
Myanmar-Lao relations and cooperation in his speech whose text 
is as follows: 
  "I am most grateful to Your Excellency and Madame Phoumsavan 
for the kind hospitality extended to us since our arrival this 
morning in the beautiful city of Vientiane, the arrangements for 
the banquet, and the warm words of welcome expressed to our 
delegation and the compliments offered to the Union of Myanmar. 
On behalf of the Myanmar delegation, I wish to reciprocate the 
sincere sentiment of friendship conveyed to us by Your 
Excellency this evening, by stating that geography alone is not 
the factor that made us neighbours, but the spirit of kinship, 
cooperation and mutual understanding is also an element which 
completes the feeling of friendly neighbours. 
  Our two countries share the similar experience of a colonial 
past while we are bound by the common heritage of tradition and 
culture, including our values and customs enriched through the 
long established history of respective nations. It is therefore 
appreciated that in our struggle for freedom and independence, 
Myanmar and Laos have been striving for unity of national races 
and consolidation of political and economic forces leading to 
the establishment of a system best suited to the conditions of 
each country. I am happy to note that in the Lao People's 
Democratic Republic you have promulgated the first constitution 
in 1991, promoting the unity of the Lao people and enhancing the 
leadership of the government in building a people's democracy 
which constantly applies the foreign policy of peace, 
independence, friendship and cooperation, taking part actively 
in the common tasks of the nations of the world. 
  We in Myanmar have also been in the process of realising 
consensus on the guidelines and principles of a firm 
constitution through the national convention held in January 
1993 with 700 delegates representing eight different walks of 
life from among the 45-million population. It is our historical 
assignment to realise the emergence of a state constitution 
which will generate the unity, peace and prosperity of our 
nation. We are implementing our share of contribution through 
unswerving to promote peace and stability among nations based on 
the principle enshrined in the United Nations charter and 
through application of our active and independent foreign policy 
reflecting the five principles of peaceful coexistence. 
  I am most encouraged to learn that the close cooperation 
between our two countries have fruitful results, particularly in 
the fields of high level exchange of visit, sharing experience 
and technology in agriculture, forestry, construction works and 
recreational facilities. There has been increasing contacts 
between the two countries in the religious fields by exchange of 
visits among sanghas [monks], and donations of religious objects 
and material as well. After we had first established, in 
December 1990, cooperation in drug abuse control through the 
meetings of national commissions, further consolidation was 
achieved by signing the memorandum of understanding on drug 
abuse control among the People's Republic of China, the Lao 
People's Democratic Republic, the Union of Myanmar, and the 
Kingdom of Thailand on 26 October 1993 in New York. In addition, 
Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand have been able to hold ministerial 
meetings in 1992 and 1994 on the subject of drug suppression. 
  In order to further strengthen the atmosphere of friendship, 
cooperation and understanding, it is envisaged that a joint 
commission could be established while cooperation in tourism, 
industries, and promotion of trade and commerce between the two 
countries would be encouraged. I hope that these aspirations 
will be fulfilled during the current visit which is designated 
to signal the conclusion of [the] Myanmar-Lao boundary treaty. 
  We are increasingly aware of the delicate and complex 
transition of situations in our region and beyond. We also 
realised that such situations developing even without our own 
making will not spare us to chart our own course of development 
alone. It is, therefore, imperative to build a sound working 
relationship through trust and interdependence among nations. 
In order to achieve this aim, mutual goodwill and cooperation 
should be widely practised in our bilateral relations as well as 
in our relations with the neighboring countries, ensuring peace 
and harmony in the region where we belong. Constructive approach 
to all issues that exist among us would result in resolving 
peacefully all the differences. Only in this atmosphere of 
peace and stability, we will be able to achieve progress and 
development of nation. I hope that my visit will in a most 
constructive way contribute towards the accomplishment of our 
aspiration. 
  It is my firm belief that a strong desire to build 
substantial and friendly relations with neighbours will always 
receive positive response when there is mutual trust and 
goodwill. To arrive at such an atmosphere, we will have to 
establish closer relations among nations.

  [Text] [no dateline as received] On June 11 morning, the 
boundary agreement will be signed between the Lao PDR [People's 
Democratic Republic] president and the Myanmar [Burma] SLORC 
[State Law and Order Restoration Council] chairman in the 
presence of the official delegations from both sides. After 
signing the agreement, the SLORC chairman and his delegation 
will visit That Luang temple in Vientiane, and in the afternoon 
will leave for Luang Prabang and will come back to Vientiane on 
June 12 afternoon. 
  Yesterday, Lao Deputy Foreign Minister Souban Salitthilat 
and 
Myanmar Ambassador to Laos U Maung Maung Lay signed two maps of 
the boundary, scale 1/10,000 and scale 1/50,000, between the two 
countries. The boundary, 236 km along the Mekong river, has 
been jointly surveyed since January 1991. 
  In connection with his visit to Laos, Senior General Than 
Shwe's biography and portrait was published in today's issues of 
the local dailies "PASASON" and "VIENTIANE MAI." 
  Senior Gen. Than Shwe was born on February 2, 1933. He 
completed his military study as a military officer. He joined 
the army in 1953 and since then had been promoted to several 
military ranks until he became deputy chief of staff of the army 
in 1980. In 1990 he became vice chairman of the SLORC, deputy 
chief of the general staff and deputy supreme commander. 
  He was appointed to the current posts as chairman of the 
SLORC, prime minister and army supreme commander on April 23, 
1992. He has been awarded medals on sixteen occasions. 
  On arrival at the airport, the Myanmar delegation issued a 
statement on its visit to the Lao PDR. 
  Following is the full text of the statement: 
  At the invitation of His Excellency Mr. Nouhak Phoumsavan, 
president of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, His 
Excellency Senior Gen. Than Shwe, chairman of the State Law and 
Order Restoration Council, accompanied by Madame Than Shwe, 
Secretary of the State Law and Order Restoration Council Lt. 
General Khin Nyunt and high-ranking officials of the government 
of the Union of Myanmar arrived in Vientiane on an official 
friendship visit to friendly neighbouring country, the Lao 
People's Democratic Republic, from 9 to 13 June 1994. 
  The leader of the Myanmar delegation conveys the greetings 
and goodwill of the people of the Union of Myanmar to the 
president, and through him, to the people of the Lao People's 
Democratic Republic. Reflecting the steady growth of friendship, 
cooperation and understanding between the two leaderships and 
peoples, exchanges of visits at the highest level took place in 
recent years providing further impetus for development of 
sharing experience and technology in the fields of agriculture, 
forestry, construction works and recreational facilities. There 
has been increasing contacts between the two countries in the 
religious fields by exchange of visits among Buddhist monks and 
donations of religious objects and materials in both countries. 
  Since December 1990, Myanmar [Burma] and Laos have been 
cooperating in the field of drug abuse control through the 
meetings of national commission. The cooperation has been 
further consolidated in the signing of the memorandum of 
understanding among the People's Republic of China, the Lao 
People Democratic Republic, the Union of Myanmar, and the 
Kingdom of Thailand on 26 October 1993 in New York. Ministerial 
level meetings also took place between Myanmar, Thailand, and 
Laos from 13 to 14 March 1992 in Bangkok, and from 9 to 11 
February 1994 in Yangon [Rangoon]. 
  As good neighbours, Myanmar and Laos have commenced the 
process of the demarcation of the boundary between the two 
countries since 1990 under the management of the joint boundary 
commission and successfully carried out the completion of 
drawing the agreement relating to the fixed boundary between the 
two countries in the Mekong river. The Myanmar delegation looks 
forward to sign the boundary agreement during the visit. 
  While in the Lao People's Democratic Republic, the Myanmar 
delegation will hold friendly meetings between the two heads of 
state and at other ministerial levels to exchange views between 
the two governments, thus contributing to the progress and 
stability of the region. 
  The spirit of friendship and cooperation between the 
neighbouring countries prevails between Myanmar and Laos and on 
various occasions Myanmar had donated rice, paddy seeds, salt, 
water pumps, teak seeds and other commodities to Laos in Yangon. 
The Laotian side donated 20,000 kips [Lao currency] on 5 
September 1991 for the victims of the floods in the Ayayarwaddy 
division. 
  The chairman of the State Law and Order Restoration Council 
and Madame Than Shwe will visit places of historical and 
cultural interest as well as economic centres during their stay 
in the Lao People's Democratic Republic.

  [Text] At 0900 today, His Excellency [H.E.] Saman 
Vi-gnaket, chairman of the National Assembly, received a 
courtesy call from H.E. Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, first 
secretary of the State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] 
of the Union of Myanmar [Burma], who is accompanying H.E. 
General Than Shwe and his wife on a visit to Laos from 9 to 13

  H.E. National Assembly Chairman Saman Vi-gnaket expressed 
pleasure with and hailed the visit to Laos by H.E. Lt. Gen. Khin 
Nyunt, which was regarded as an event of great significance in 
the history of the relations between the two countries. H.E.

friendship, and cooperation among the nations in this region. 
  H.E. Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt thanked H.E. the National Assembly 
chairman for according a warm welcome to the Myanmar delegation 
during its visit to Laos, noting that the relations of 
neighborly friendship between the Union of Myanmar and the Lao

stability, and independence. H.E. Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt held that 
neighborly relations between Myanmar and Laos have been fruitful

  [Text] The Governments of the Lao People's Democratic 
Republic [LPDR] and the Union of Myanmar [Burma] signed three 
cooperation agreements on the morning of 11 June in the presence 
of His Excellency [H.E.] Nouhak Phoumsavan, president of the 
LPDR, and H.E. General Than Shwe, chairman of the State Law and 
Order Restoration Council [SLORC] of the Union of Myanmar, and 
witnessed by the official delegations from the two sides. 
  Respectively representing the Lao and Myanmar sides in 
signing the agreement on tourism cooperation were H.E. Somsavat 
Lengsavat, LPDR foreign affairs minister, and H.E. Brigadier 
General Abel, minister of planning and economic development of 
the Union of Myanmar. The other two agreements -- the agreement 
regarding the establishment of a joint Lao-Myanmar commission 
for cooperation and the LPDR-Union of Myanmar governmental 
agreement on the permanent international boundary along the 
Mekong River between the two countries -- were signed by H.E. 
Somsavat Lengsavat and H.E. U Ohn Gyaw, foreign minister of the 
Union of Myanmar. 
  The contents of the agreement on tourism cooperation between 
the governments of the two countries stipulates that the two 
sides agree to create conditions to facilitate long-term 
cooperation in tourism development for mutual benefit. The two 
sides will provide conveniences to citizens of the two countries 
and those of third countries as individual persons or in groups 
in travelling from Laos into the Union of Myanmar or from the 
Union of Myanmar into Laos for tourism purposes by relying on 
the laws of each country and in accordance with international 
practices. The Lao Government assigns the National Tourism 
Organization and the Government of the Union of Myanmar assigns 
the Ministry of Hotels and Tourism to be in charge of 
implementing [the agreement] and providing conveniences to each 
other in opening offices of tourism representatives in one 
another's country on the basis of the valid laws of the country 
concerned. At the same time, the two sides will encourage one 
another to exchange lessons and documents on the organization, 
management, administration, and operation of tourism businesses 
and assist one another in training personnel in the tourism 
sector. 
  The agreement on the establishment of a joint commission for 
cooperation stipulates that with a desire to increase and 
strengthen firmer and lasting relations and cooperation between 
the two sides, to reaffirm the wishes of each side in 
strengthening the ties and cooperation between the two 
countries, with a desire to further strengthen the existing 
relations of friendship, and to promote the development of 
bilateral cooperation between the two countries on the basis of 
the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and respect for each 
other's sovereignty, the two governments have agreed that the 
two sides will set up a joint commission to facilitate 
consultations and cooperation between the two countries, 
especially in the economic, trade, scientific, social, cultural, 
and other fields of mutual interests. The said commission is 
charged with exploring and finding ways and methods aimed at 
promoting the said objectives and with ensuring appropriate 
coordination and the implementation of the various resolutions 
and agreements, including this agreement. 
  With regard to the governmental agreement on the permanent 
international boundary between the two countries along the 
Mekong River, the signatories to the agreement have agreed that 
beginning on the day the agreement becomes valid, the boundary 
between the LPDR and the Union of Myanmar will be permanently 
fixed in accordance with the present conditions of the Mekong 
River, which have been surveyed and demarcated by the joint 
Lao-Myanmar waterways survey team, regardless of any changes 
which may later occur in this river. The boundary between the 
two countries is 236 kilometers long and is demarcated by 86 
border posts on each side of the boundary which was jointly 
surveyed by the two sides beginning in January 1991 and ending 
in 1993. The agreement also stressed the safeguarding of the 
boundary between the two countries in which the signatories will 
employ appropriate measures to maintain and protect the boundary 
demarcation posts located in their respective territories in 
order to prevent their removal, degradation, and destruction. 
At the same time, the signatories also agreed that neither side 
can carry out navigational operations or utilize the currents of 
the Mekong River or water on the side of their international 
boundary for industrial purposes, drainage, storage, irrigation, 
hydroelectricity generation, and other purposes which may bring 
losses to the interest of the other side. In dealing with this 
problem, the signatories will continue to closely work together 
for mutual interests by utilizing the Mekong River in a correct 
and fair manner. This agreement also defines the rights to 
navigation along the Mekong River which is the boundary between 
the two countries. The rights to navigation of the signatories 
will be totally guaranteed even though changes may later occur 
along the navigation route of the said river. In addition, the 
agreement also stipulates that if boats or nationals of a 
signatory country are in danger or broken in the Mekong River 
belonging to the other side, that side must provide needed 
assistance at all times to the boats, navigators, crew members, 
and passengers as well as cargo on those boats. The signatories 
also agreed that all materials collected from the boats which 
are in danger or broken will not be charged with any customs 
duties and fees provided that they are not used in each other's 
country.

  [Text] Interior Ministry officials have been instructed to 
keep a close watch on dissident Burmese students and ethnic 
minority groups as part of preparations for the ASEAN 
Ministerial Meeting next month in Bangkok to which Burma has 
been invited as an observer. 
  A ministry source said there have been reports that 
dissident 
Burmese may try to protest the presence of Burmese 
representatives and try to obstruct them from attending the 
meeting that begins July 11. 
  Foreign Affairs Division director Praphakon Samiti said some 
Burmese students at Ban Maniloi, also called the Burmese 
Students Centre, which is located in Ratchaburi province's Pak 
Tho district had telephoned private organisations and the mass 
media, and tried to project a negative image of the centre. 
  There are now about 150 Burmese students at the centre, 20 
of 
them women. 
  Deputy Interior permanent secretary for security affairs 
Chaloem Phromloet, meanwhile, has ordered Ratchaburi authorities 
to take preventive measures and at the same time instructed 
Burmese students and people living in the vicinity of Ban 
Maniloi, who have lately been locked in confrontation, to 
exercise restraint and try to settle their problems in an 
amicable way. 
  To that end, he has issued the following instructions: 
  -- Students who feel they are not being justly treated 
should 
lodge a complaint with the provincial governor who may set up a 
committee to investigate their complaint. 
  -- Students are to refrain from causing trouble, hurting 
authorities or damaging anyone's property otherwise they will be 
subject to legal action. 
  -- Provincial authorities are to seek cooperation from local 
villagers to ensure that they don't beat up Burmese students, or 
they will face legal action.

  [Text] Thailand has asked Brunei to step up economic 
cooperation by jointly investing in a fertiliser plant and 
buying more rice, Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said 
yesterday. 
  Brunei's Foreign Minister Prince Mohamed Bolkiah said he 
would consider the proposal to enter a joint venture to produce 
fertiliser from Brunei, Squadron Leader Prasong said. 
  Brunei has limited investments overseas because it is a 
small 
country, Sqn. Ldr. Prasong quoted the prince as saying. 
  But there was no word on Thailand's proposal to buy more 
rice. 
  "We asked Brunei to buy more Thai rice because Thailand 
continues to suffer a deficit in bilateral trade," Sqn. Ldr. 
Prasong said. 
  Prince Bolkiah heads home today at the end of a three-day 
visit. 
  He paid a courtesy call on Prime Minister Chuan Likphai at 
Government House yesterday. 
  Discussions over the past three days also covered 
opportunities for Thai workers in Brunei. 
  According to Sqn Ldr Prasong, Brunei is satisfied with the 
performance of Thai workers and prospects for them may broaden 
as the oil-rich state puts more effort into development.

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday openly hinted 
for the first time that a dissolution of Parliament end the 
political crisis. [sentence as published] 
  He has previously rejected this as a solution. 
  He was speaking as growing pressure from democracy groups 
for 
political reform threatened to isolate him and his Democrat 
Party from his former prodemocracy allies. 
  He has firmly refused to bow to the demands of hunger 
striker 
Chalat Worachat and his supporters to redraft the constitution. 
  "This Government has a term of four years. During this four 
years, the House can be dissolved at any time and a censure 
motion can also be submitted against the Government any time. 
  "Don't be worried. The Government will do what is best and 
of most benefit to the public," Mr Chuan told 3,000 supporters 
at the opening of the southern livestock market in Thung Song 
district, Nakhon Si Thammarat. 
  Prominent academics and lecturers from 12 educational 
institutions have, made a similar call. 
  Mr. Chuan, responding to questions, later insisted he still 
had no plan to dissolve Parliament yet but conceded he had 
pointed to the possibility to try to make people understand that 
a dissolution and censure motion could occur in a parliamentary 
system. 
  He said he was still confident the Government could reach an 
understanding with all concerned on the problem. 
  Mr. Chuan, throughout a series of political conflicts often 
within his own coalition, frequently stated he had no plan to 
dissolve the Lower House. 
  In his speech yesterday, he insisted his administration was 
leading the country toward greater democracy and a better 
economy. 
  This was reflected in the form of an increase in exports and 
a five-fold rise of investment in the provinces in the past year. 
  "The Government is confident the course in which it is 
taking 
the country is the best," Mr. Chuan said. 
  He thanked people for their show of support. 
  "Please feel confident that the Government is doing its 
best. 
Do not be concerned or be suspicious. We must do the best. 
What will be will be." 
  He repeated his frequent line that his administration would 
run the country honestly to prevent others from citing 
corruption as an excuse to stage a coup. 
  Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut has proposed 
amendment 
of Article 211 of the charter to allow the setting up a 
Constitution Drafting Council. 
  Mr. Chuan said the issue had been settled at the Wednesday's 
meeting of the ruling parties. 
  He said all coalition partners agreed not to support or 
sponsor a move to redraft the constitution because the 
Government could not abandon principles to comply with demands 
from only one man. 
  Gen Chawalit is due to visit Narathiwat today and will fly 
back to Bangkok on the same aircraft as the premier. 
  Mr. Chuan said he might take the chance to discuss the idea 
with Gen Chawalit. 
  About 500 people turned up at Mr. Chuan's home in Trang 
yesterday to express their support for his stand against Mr 
Chalat's demands. 
  He travelled from Trang to Nakhon Si Thammarat to preside 
over a seminar on development strategies for the middle and 
southern regions. 
  At least 22 signs with slogans supporting the premier were 
dotted along a five-kilometre stretch of highway used by his 
motorcade. 
  He stopped in Huai Yot district where about 300 supporters 
welcomed him. 
  At the Thai Hotel in Nakhon Si Thammarat, the seminar venue, 
1,000 people turned up with more than 100 posters and banners to 
support Mr. Chuan.

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday ruled out 
a House dissolution, while government spokesman Aphisit 
Wetchachiwa rejected the possibility of bringing the opposition 
Chat Phatthana Party into the coalition. 
  A House dissolution and the inclusion of Chat Phatthana have 
been floated as possible solutions to the political impasse 
stemming from the hunger strike by political Chalat Worachat. 
  Several newspapers yesterday reported that Chuan indicated 
he 
would dissolve the House of Representatives when he addressed a 
group of villagers in Nakhon Si Thammarat on Saturday. 
  Chuan had told the villagers that a House dissolution was 
one 
of the "ordinary" solution available under the democratic system. 
  Chuan, who was visiting his home province of Trang 
yesterday, 
said he was not planning a dissolution. 
  "I don't have any plan to dissolve the House," Chuan said. 
  "When I talked to the villagers yesterday (Saturday), I 
mentioned a House dissolution and no-confidence debates. I 
simply told the villagers that these two things could happen at 
any time under a democratic system." 
  Aphisit said in a telephone interview the situation did not 
yet warrant the inclusion of the Chat Phatthana Party of former 
Prime Minister Chatchai Chunhawan in the government. 
  On Saturday, Seritham Party leader Athit Urairat suggested 
that Chuan bring in Chat Phatthana as a way out of the problem.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Principle of the `Obsolete' Politicians; </F>
Chuan Survives, Chalat Dies, the Country is Divided"] 
  [Text] As Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and other core 
members of the Democrat Party repeatedly cite the word 
"principle" as an excuse to justify their actions, they 
themselves have nakedly exposed the true nature of Thailand's 
oldest political party. In the past, the government of General 
Suchinda Khraprayun also cited the need for joint efforts to 
develop the country's democratic system as a pretext to justify 
its actions. Worse still, the Democrats often arrogantly attack 
any peaceful activities calling for democracy. 
  We stated on several occasions that we do not agree with 
Chalat Worachat in using a hunger strike to push for the 
observance of the major "principle" of democracy. However, we 
do agree with the "essence" of his demands. Although we 
disagree with his method, we, with unbiased and fair perception, 
believe that Chalat has chosen the hunger strike as a means to 
create strong agitation in society so that he can attract the 
people's attention to the struggle for genuine democracy, the 
"principle" which requires the participation of the people in 
every aspect of the democratization process such as in drafting 
a constitution, the decentralization of power and election of 
provincial governors. 
  Chalat's maneuver would have failed and received no support 
from any party had the present government faithfully followed 
the fundamental "principle" of the democratic system in 
compliance with the aspirations of the people who voted in the 
general election on the 13 September 1992. The people clearly 
stated that they want the present government to do away with all 
conditions and obstacles that hampered the development of the 
democratic system and that had been the cause of the bloodshed 
in May 1992. The five parties in the coalition government had 
all pledged and promised the people that they would amend the 
Constitution to make it more democratic. But, none have honored 
their words. Recently, the Democrat Party, the core of the 
coalition government, has shown no signs of respecting public 
opinion. Indulging in power, the Democrats believe that they and 
their colleagues represent correctness. 
  We are extremely disappointed with the unconstructive, 
inhumane, and unBuddhistlike behavior of Deputy Finance Minister 
Trairong Suwannakhiri, who compared Chalat's hunger strike to a 
robbery and said that Chalat will die for nothing. The prime 
minister, who is also the leader of the Democrat Party, can best 
use the "principle" he has been adhering to for 23 years to 
judge whether or not such statements should be uttered by an MP 
from his honorable party. We can recall the political confusion 
and several conflicts of opinion triggered by the impolite and 
inappropriate statements of this minister in the past. 
  In attempting to end the crisis, the prime minister simply 
clings tightly to the "principle" he claims to be correct and 
overrides the problem. He has no courage to initiate any 
political move and just allows the conflict to be further 
aggravated, while his subordinates keep adding fuel to the fire 
and provoking , with statements against those who chose peaceful 
means to pursue their causes. 
  The prime minister is reputed for his firm adherence to 
principle. This is one of the good characteristics of a leader 
of the country. However, if his adherence to the principle is 
aimed at preserving his premiership for as long as possible, he 
is then a selfish person. It is the obsolete principle which 
often causes abnormal problems in the country. 
  We are extremely disappointed with the prime minister and 
the 
Democrat Party for they have paid no attention to the valuable 
suggestion from Dr. Prawet Wasi. The well respected Dr. Prawet 
has recommended that the whole political system be reformed so 
as to avoid violent confrontation and so that "Chuan, Chalat, 
and the country can all survive." Instead of listening to the 
advice, the Democrat Party has resorted to all kinds of 
political tricks including lying and setting up pro-government 
mobs. In short, the Democrat Party is behaving as the 
government of General Suchinda Khraprayun did before the latter 
was ousted by the people. 
  The behavior of leaders of the Democrat Party has so far 
clearly proven their cunning and insincerity. They will not 
hesitate to do anything to keep the parties in the coalition and 
the opposition bloc and private organizations under their thumb. 
They will use their own yardstick, which they call "principle." 
Those who rebel are labelled as trouble makers. Such an 
attitude is identical to that of past "rulers" who also labelled 
themselves as the yardstick of society and forced everyone to 
accept their criteria. 
  Obstinate politicians must be stopped now. We are now at the 
brink of the dead spot of democracy, which was earned from the 
blood of the fallen heroes in the May incident. Otherwise, the 
scenario of "Chuan survives, Chalat dies, and the country is 
divided," will eventually become reality.

  [Excerpt] Most villagers living in the vicinity of the 
so-called "safe area" for dissident Burmese students in Rat 
Buri's Pak Tho district are disgusted with the behaviour of the 
students, saying they are unruly, aggressive and arrogant, with 
a distinct bent for the bottle. 
  The villagers say they would rather see the Burmese Students 
Centre, as the designated safe area is officially called, 
relocated elsewhere so that peace can once again return to their 
community. 
  Relations between the villagers and the students worsened 
recently when four Burmese at the centre were injured in attacks 
by Thai villagers, with each side blaming the other for the 
escalating tension. 
  The incident sparked an outcry from the students who duly 
filed through their representatives complaints with the Interior 
Ministry, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 
and foreign embassies in Bangkok, and also used the media to 
highlight their plight. 
  The students say they have been targets of constant attack 
by 
villagers and since their so-called "safe area" was no longer 
secure they didn't want to continue living there. 
  There are a total of 183 Burmese housed at the Rat Buri 
centre, also called Ban Maniloi, according to the latest count. 
  The students told the media of the stress they were going 
through stemming from the constant fear of another attack by 
Thai villagers since the security guards at the entrance of the 
centre not only didn't help them but tended to side with the 
villagers. 
  "We want to live with the Thai villagers like brothers and 
sisters, but we do not know why the villagers do not like us and 
want to hurt us," one of them said. 
  But according to the villagers the Burmese are the 
trouble-makers, a fact confirmed by camp officials, who 
requested anonymity. 
  Samruai Kaenkut, the headman of Ban Maniloi, was less 
critical, saying as far as he knew only 16 students had acted in 
an arrogant and irresponsible manner, causing trouble not only 
to their colleagues but also to the villagers. 
  Police have to be careful in dealing with them because the 
students being foreigners, any legal action against them may 
entail intervention from foreign missions in Bangkok, including 
the UNHCR. 
  The alleged rape of a seven-year-old schoolgirl of Wat 
Maniloi School by a Burmese student is believed to have sparked 
the local anger and subsequent attacks on the Burmese. 
  Police have said they will take action but after consulting 
their superiors and after they have gathered more evidence.

  [Text] After the lifting of the United States trade 
embargo against Vietnam, the United States Asia Private 
Commercial and Technical Council conducted a public opinion poll 
and the results show that United States trade opportunities in 
Vietnam could be worth about 2.7 billion dollars in 1994 and 
1995. The figure may increase to 8.2 billion dollars in the 
following eight years. 
  At the same time, representatives from well-known American 
companies came to Vietnam and worked out a promising future of 
doing business in the country. The director in charge of 
selling Kodak products in Indochina said Kodak could gain from 
four to eight million dollars in its first year of doing 
business in Vietnam. The Boeing Aviation Company predicted that 
Vietnam would have from 60 to 80 passenger planes within 10 
years and the company hoped that its income from selling planes 
to Vietnam would be from three to five billion dollars. The 
Caterpillar Construction Machine Company said it was considering 
selling heavy excavators and other construction equipment worth 
700 million dollars to Vietnam. There are many other plans for 
doing business with Vietnam by American companies. 
  But while the embargo was lifted, the United States has not 
yet granted Vietnam an opportunity to equally trade with the 
United States. Vietnam is one of ten countries in the world who 
do not enjoy the most favored nation status. Vietnamese goods 
imported to the United States are taxed very highly in 
comparison with the same goods imported from elsewhere. 
  In order to be an equal trade partner, Vietnam has to join 
the General Agreement on Trade and Tariff, or GATT. Concerning 
this matter, Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said that 
Vietnam was ready to participate in the GATT system. He was 
speaking at an international conference called New Waves: 
ASEAN, Vietnam, and China, held in Singapore last month. 
  Therefore, it is clear that obstacles in trade ties between 
Vietnam and the United States were coming from the United 
States. If Vietnam was not able to enjoy the most favored nation 
status, trade relations between Vietnam and the United States 
would not develop and American companies would lose their 
opportunities in the Vietnamese market. Therefore, while 30 
American companies have set up representative offices in Vietnam 
and the embargo has been lifted, American businessmen's 
operations in Vietnam have not yet boomed. 
  The potential for the development of trade ties between 
Vietnam and the United States exists and this potential can only 
be fully developed if there are equal opportunities.

<F P=106> [Report on 2 June 1994 interview by AFP correspondent </F>
(Avreck) with Pham Van Dong, adviser of the Communist Party of 
Vietnam Central Committee; place not given -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] How does your excellency view the 
current renovation process? In your excellency's view, are 
there any obstacles that may cause this process to stray off 
course? If so, what are they? 
  [Pham Van Dong] In the current renovation process in 
Vietnam, 
our nation is advancing on an uncharted path. In such an 
advance, our nation will certainly face many obstacles in 
various forms. With our clear-sightedness and vigilance, we are 
trying to exploit all our potential to prevent, overcome, and 
remove all obstacles in order to achieve our goals. 
  [Correspondent] What were the reasons that led to the 
decision by Vietnamese leaders in 1986 to embark on such a 
renovation? Did your excellency take part in that decision? In 
your capacity as adviser to the party Central Committee, will 
your excellency continue to participate in the drafting of the 
renovation policy? 
  [Pham Van Dong] In the years immediately after our national 
reunification, we thought we could advance directly to 
socialism. Now we realize that this was a mistake caused by our 
willful, subjective, and leftist thinking, one that is usually 
made by revolutionaries. It is imperative to find a new path, a 
path that can be used only as a transition in conformity with 
the pattern of history. This is precisely the goal our people 
have pursued over the past 15 years as it is suitable to our 
country's geographical, political, economic, and social 
characteristics. These developments led to the Sixth Congress 
of the Communist Party of Vietnam in 1986 -- a congress of 
renovation, clear-sightedness and revolutionary bravery, and 
culture. 
  Life has attested even more clearly to the diversified 
potential of the renovation movement. We have done our utmost 
to discover and develop these potential through our actual work 
and our theoretical studies. A large movement of history is 
always inbuilt with great cultural and humanistic values that 
can only be fully developed with the wisdom and savvy of the 
entire nation. 
  As provided for in my functions, I have been and will 
continue to participate in the drafting of the renovation policy 
and in the implementation of the renovation process. 
  [Correspondent] While shifting to the market economy, will 
there be any danger of Vietnam renouncing its socialism? How do 
you guarantee that the transition takes place without any 
political and social upheaval? Does President Ho Chi Minh's 
thought still have value for contemporary Vietnam? 
  [Pham Van Dong] Your very interesting question inspires my 
answer. First, it should be recalled that the market economy, 
one of the great achievements of humanity, has existed in 
different social regimes. Since time immemorial before the 
arrival of capitalism, there has been many stages in which the 
market economy has developed magnificently. It is not our 
policy to develop just any market economy, but one in accordance 
with the socialist orientation and the appropriate management of 
a state governed by law. To us, it could only be a law-governed 
state of the people, for the people, and by the people, and 
imbued with the Vietnamese identity. 
  Such a market economy would be the future course for 
achieving the goal of building a prosperous people, a powerful 
country, and a equitable and civilized society. From there, 
they will develop gradually and proportionately in a ever more 
intensive and extensive fashion. The liberal and comprehensive 
development of each person is the condition for the liberal and 
comprehensive development of all people. Here we see one of the 
main aspects of the integration between culture and renovation 
in our country. 
  In this domain as well as in the entire renovation process, 
Ho Chi Minh thought will be a source of inspiration and the 
orientation for action for the entire nation. It should be 
added that the core of Ho Chi Minh thought is to liberate the 
nation, society, and humanity. It is also a driving force in 
the evolution of history. Because of this Ho Chi Minh thought 
has contemporary value and will always remain so. 
  [Correspondent] How does your excellency view Vietnam as 
it is about embark on the 21st century? Can Vietnam become a 
potential tiger [economy] of Asia? Can or should Vietnam join 
the ASEAN community? Does your excellency have any observations 
on Vietnam's current relations with France, China, and the 
United States? 
  [Pham Van Dong] Our foreign friends have often talked about 
the possibility of Vietnam becoming a tiger in Asia. There are 
reasons for their saying so. For us, we are striving for an 
ever-faster economic growth on a firm basis in parallel with 
social justice, constantly improving the people's material and 
cultural life, thus modestly contributing to peace, national 
independence, democracy and social progress in the world. 
  As for Vietnam's ties with ASEAN countries, representatives 
of our government have time and again clearly stated: China, 
France, and the United States are countries that have friendly 
ties with us. However, each country has its own particularities 
that we are fully aware of its importance. We are trying our 
best to develop fine relations with each of them in the interest 
of each side as well as for the sake of peace and development in 
the region and the world. 
  [Correspondent] With your abundant experience of many years 
in the leadership role, what is your excellency's view about the 
progress Vietnam has made over the past 20 years? 
  [Pham Van dong] As time goes by, people see their past more 
clearly. On the other hand, in our era which is one of constant 
and eventful changes, we must be equipped with a new vision so 
that we can see this era more clearly. As in our national 
situation, this vision is precisely the vision of culture. 
Culture, in its broadest definition, means the most profound 
aspiration and the finest achievements of human beings in the 
history of mankind. 
  After the embryonic period and the initial stage of 20 
years, 
the renovation has meant overall progress for the country. It 
is similar to a great cultural motivation with an inbuilt 
inexhaustible source of human potential to be discovered and 
developed. Here I would like to say a few words about the 
Vietnamese people. They are people who have been steeled 
through the countless ordeals of the country's history and 
through their millennium-old heroic struggle. This has helped 
the Vietnamese people find their own creative path of 
development. The Vietnamese people have achieved constant 
growth imbued with humanistic and nationalistic traits. The 
renovation in Vietnam at present is a great undertaking of the 
Vietnamese people and will constantly advance to new horizons.

  [Summary] Dear friends: The fifth session of the National 
Assembly entered its 14th day today. 
  "In the morning, the National Assembly held group 
discussions 
on the ratification of the United Nations's 1992 Convention on 
the Law of the Sea. All the deputies favored the ratification 
of the convention by our country." They regarded this 
convention as an international legal basis for our people's 
struggle to safeguard their national sovereignty and territorial 
integrity. 
  Many deputies called for increased propaganda on the 
convention and for efforts to instill in the people a sense of 
awareness about the need to safegard the country's territorial 
sea. 
  "In the afternoon the deputies held group discussions on the 
draft law on the admendment of and supplement to a number of 
articles of the law on corporations and private businesses. 
  "All those who spoke unanimously agreed to amend various 
articles of these two laws in such a way as to suit the actual 
situation at present." They added: Major revisions of these 
two laws will be considered when conditions permit. 
  As for the amendment of Article 16 of the Law on 
Cooperations 
and Article 10 of the Law on Private Busines, many deputies 
favored the idea of allowing people whose applications for the 
establishment of corporations have been turned down to appeal to 
the prime minister, if they see find the refusal unacceptable. 
  "Given that the State Economic Arbitrator will cease its 
activities beginning 1 July 1994, the drafting committee for 
these draft laws has suggested that the powers to license 
various coporations be transferred from the economic arbitrator 
of provinces and cities under central authority, or from 
corresponding administrative units, to the planning committees 
of provinces and cities under central authority. It has also 
been suggested that the powers to license private firms be 
transferred from the economic arbitrator who is equal in status 
to the people's committee granting licenses, to the planning 
organs which are equivalent in status to the people's committee 
granting licenses." 
  Some deputies also asked what they should do if somes 
districts and town have no planning organs? 
  "All the deputies unanimously agreed with the draft law's 
suggestion that the declaration of bankruptcy by a corporation 
or a private firm must be carried out in accordance with the law 
on the bankruptcy of enterprises. 
  "Tomorrow, the National Assembly will hold group discussions 
on the situation regarding the implementation of the National 
Assembly resolution on socioeconomic tasks for the first six 
months of 1994."

  [Text] Deputies to the Ninth National Assembly while 
attending the fifth session in Hanoi have agreed that industrial 
and agricultural production are expected to achieve and surpass 
the yearly plan. Discussing the implementation of socioeconomic 
tasks in the first six months of 1994, they said that external 
economic activities are attracting many foreign investors with 
large projects, national defense and security are insured, and 
progress has been made in diplomatic relations and other fields. 
  Many deputies maintained that the party lines and government 
policies have helped develop agricultural production, the 
winter- spring crop this year has yielded a good harvest, and 
farmers' lives are improving. They held that in face of the 
challenges of the market economy, industrial and handicraft 
production still maintains its importance. 
  Deputies from Ho Chi Minh City stressed the development of 
the power industry. They said the inauguration of the last 
generator unit of the Hoa Binh hydroelectric power plant in 
northern Vietnam, the Ba Ria gas turbine power plant in southern 
Vietnam, and the completion of the 500-KV north-south 
transmission line will help boost the Vietnamese economy and 
people's lives. 
  Some others laid stress on the deployment of the program on 
equitization of state enterprises. The National Assembly 
deputies also held that results obtained in national defense and 
security also contribute to national socioeconomic development. 
They acknowledged the progress made in education, personnel 
training, and cultural and information activities. 
  However, they also outlined the difficulties in highland 
education. The deputies said the fight against public property 
waste, corruption, and smuggling was a very important but 
difficult and complicated task. They demanded that tougher 
measures should be taken to cope with these social evils.

<F P=106> [Report by station correspondent Truong Cong Hoa on the 13 </F>
June proceedings of the current Ninth National Assembly's fifth 
session in Hanoi -- portion recorded] 
  [Summary] "Dear friends: The Ninth National Assembly's 
fifth session entered its 16th work day today with a plenary 
meeting under the direction of National Assembly Vice Chairman 
Nguyen Ha Phan." 
  In the morning session, Minister of Energy Thai Phung Ne 
reported on the construction of the North-South 500-kilovolt 
power line, stressing the construction process and its 
significant role. 
  Following the energy minister's report, National Assembly 
Chairman Nong Duc Manh delivered a speech and highly appraised 
the completion of the power line, a major project of our nation. 
He said: 
  [Begin Nong Duc Manh recording] "Today, we are very pleased 
to hear Energy Minister Thai Phung Ne's report on the 
construction and completion of the North-South 500-kilovolt 
power line, a major and significant project of our nation. We 
welcome the government's close guidance and the uniform and 
urgent construction work carried out by various sectors, 
echelons, and localities. We highly commend the spirit of 
diligence, intelligence, creativity, and boldness shown by all 
cadres, workers, and the people to overcome numerous 
difficulties and acute ordeals during the building process. They 
have, indeed, contributed great efforts and energy to and made 
sacrifices for the completion of this important project. We 
would like also to thank our friends from around the world for 
their assistance to this project. 
  "Through the construction of this power line, we have not 
only built a competent contingent of scientific-technological 
cadres for the Vietnam electric sector, but we have also 
asserted new progress and our maturity in this field. This 
proves that we are able to build and manage major and modern 
projects. Also, through this project we have drawn valuable 
lessons in mobilizing workers, integrating the combined 
strengths of our nation, and attracting international 
cooperation in the new situation for the renovation undertaking. 
  "The North-South power line is the backbone grid of our 
national electric network. It is one of the most significant 
infrastructure projects built with an aim to attain national 
industrialization and modernization. Henceforth, our history 
records another route linking the North with the South, that is 
the 500-kilovolt power line. This is another manifestation of 
our unity and the unification of our fatherland. 
  "The successful construction of the project is very 
significant, yet effective and safe operation of the power line 
is much more important. I hope that the electric sector, while 
bringing its achievements into full play, will closely 
coordinate with various echelons, sectors, and localities to 
strictly protect this power line. All responsible agencies must 
strive to effectively use this project while ensuring its 
optimal safety. 
  "On this occasion, through the Minister of Energy, we would 
like to extend our kind regard and best wishes to cadres and 
workers of the electric sector and those who participated in the 
construction of this project. We wish all of you a good health 
and ever greater achievements so as to positively contribute,

  Dear friends, also at this morning session, National 
Assembly 
deputies debated the implementation of the socioeconomic 
development program during the first half of this year. All 
deputies expressed their unanimous views of the government's 
report appraising the situation in four major domains namely the 
economy, society, international cooperation, and state 
management. 
  Regarding our legal system, many deputies held that we still 
are in need of more laws. They noted, however, that although 
many laws were promulgated, their enforcement was not effective 
because of the lack of proper guiding documents.

  [Text] The Ministry of Labor, War Invalids, and Social 
Welfare held a news conference on 10 June on issues related to 
war victims in Vietnam. According to incomplete statistics, 
almost three million people were killed in the war including one 
million soldiers from throughout the country and more than four 
million people were wounded. The war also left 170,000 aged 
homeless persons who now depend on the assistance of their 
countrymen and social welfare centers. More than two million 
people were affected by toxic chemicals and about 500,000 
children were deformed. 
  Implementing and developing the nation's humanitarian 
tradition, our party, state, and people have applied various 
forms of assistance to help these war victims. However, this is 
a wide-scale and very difficult, complicated task that cannot be 
resolved by the Labor, War Invalids and Social Welfare Ministry 
alone. It needs the special attention and assistance from the 
entire society, genial persons, and humanitarian and charitable 
organizations at home and abroad. 
  Assistance programs for these war victims should include 
measures to restore and promote their physical fitness; help 
relieve their difficulties in the daily life; and create 
conditions for them to participate in various social activities, 
especially in productive labor. This will enable them to live 
peacefully with other people in society.

  [Text] After the official operation of the North-South 
500-kilovolt power line, the Minister of Energy has decided to 
lift the restriction on the use of electricity by households and 
production units in Southern Vietnam. 
  In the North, the restriction on electricity consumption has 
been lifted since the Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Power Plant began 
operating. 
  In the past, due to a shortage of electricity, households 
and 
production establishments were supplied with limited electrical 
power. Those who used electricity beyond the fixed limit had to 
pay a higher fee or a progressive rate for the extra units used. 
From now on, the restriction on the use of electricity and the 
progressive fee system are totally rescinded throughout the 
country. 
  The energy sector will strive to meet all the electricity 
demands of production and business establishments and other 
consumers.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA June 13 -- The Vietnamese Government has 
allocated 46 billion VND [Vietnamese dong] for this year's 
effort in drug control and the prevention of drug abuse. 
  The allocation is also to cover expenditures for the 
drafting 
of an anti-drug law. 
  Last year, with a budget of 26 billion VND, the government 
brought into operation 95 projects which ranged from 
sendentarisation [as received] and resettlement for nomadic hill 
tribes to the replacement of opium poppy with food and other 
crops. Much was spent on mass education on the danger of drug 
and the treatment and vocational training for addicts. 
  Last year, the law enforcement force cracked down on 904 
cases of drug trafficking and eliminated hundreds of drug dens.

  [Text] Australia's Foreign Minister, Gareth Evans, has 
urged the UN Security Council to leave the way open for North 
Korea to change its mind over international inspections of its 
nuclear facilities. While reaffirming Australia's willingness 
to abide by any decision the Security Council might take on 
sanctions, Senator Evans said in Manila that the situation would 
have to be handled delicately. Trevor Watson reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Watson] Senator Evans said he would 
deplore any decision that drove the North Koreans beyond the 
point of no return in their dealings with the International 
Atomic Energy Agency or the world community. Nobody, he says, 
knows if sanctions will do that or encourage the North to be 
more open in the future. 
  [Evans] Will it serve the purpose for keeping them committed 
in the future and to ensure that we at least know there won't be 
diversion of nuclear material in the future, or will it be the 
trigger which in fact pushes them over the brink to walk away 
from the Nonproliferation Treaty altogether? [end recording]

  [Text] Sydney, May 27 (AFP) -- Australian trade with Asia 
continued its rapid growth of previous years in 1993 as exports 
to the region surged nine percent to 40 billion dollars (29 
billion US), according to official data released Friday. 
  A six-monthly trade analysis by the Department of Foreign 
Affairs also showed a 17.5 percent rise in exports of 
elaborately transformed manufactures (ETMs) to the world, 
dominated by a 30 percent increase to Asia. 
  Japan remained Australia's largest export market, accounting 
for almost a quarter of total merchandise exports worth 15.6 
billion dollars. 
  At the same time, Australia imported 11.8 billion dollars 
worth of goods from Japan, resulting in a trade surplus of 3.8 
billion dollars. 
  Australia's total merchandise trade rose by 10 percent in 
current dollar terms to 125 billion dollars, with eight percent 
export growth and a 12 percent increase in imports, the report 
said. 
  Coal remained the biggest commodity export, representing 
12.3 
percent of Australia's total merchandise exports. 
  "While merchandise trade recorded another surplus -- 454 
million in 1993 -- the relative strength of imports has reduced 
it substantially from the high of four billion dollars in 1991 
and the 1992 level of nearly three billion dollars," the report 
said. 
  It attributed the fall in the surplus to a decline in the 
terms of trade, associated with continued weakness in world 
commodity prices, increased demand for imports flowing from the 
relatively strong@rate of domestic recovery and subdued economic 
activity in a number of key export markets. 
  Exports to the United States dropped in 1993 by about one 
percent, while US imports grew by seven percent, increasing the 
trade surplus in favour of the United States to 8.1 billion 
dollars. 
  During the same period exports to European Union countries 
also fell by three percent while imports from the EU grew by 
eight percent, the trade imbalance worsening for Australia to 
6.4 billion dollars. 
  A statement released by Trade Minister Bob McMullan's office 
said the figures clearly indicated the government's closer 
integration with Asia was paying dividends in the form of 
increased export earnings. 
  Exports to the East Asia region, including Japan, Korea, 
China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and the Association of South East 
Asian Nations (ASEAN) -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, 
the Philippines and Thailand -- increased by eight percent to 37 
billion dollars.

President Kim Il-song said that North Korea can abandon its 
nuclear development program if it can receive economic support 
from the United States to convert its graphite-moderated reactor 
to a light-water reactor, along with the normalization of 
diplomatic relations with the United States through dialogue. 
  Selig Harrison, senior associate of the Carnegie Endowment

conference with KYODO News Agency: President Kim expressed that 
he has the intention to stop the radiochemical laboratory and 
the ongoing construction of a 200,000 kilowatt nuclear reactor 
if the United States and other foreign countries promise to 
provide technology to North Korea for building the light-water 
reactor. Harrison, who paid a week-day visit to Pyongyang at 
the invitation of North Korea, met with President Kim on 9 June 
and held talks with other North Korean high-level leaders, 
including First Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu. After this, 
he arrived in Beijing on 10 June.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Yi Myong-ku from Berlin] </F>
  [Text] North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam said 
that North Korea will not accept nuclear inspection and will 
resolutely deal with outside sanctions including those by the 
United Nations. Kim Yong-nam who arrived in Berlin on 9 June 
without giving any explanation claimed that since North Korea 
withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, it has no 
duty to implement the nuclear inspection. 
  Kim Yong-nam said that North Korea will receive nuclear 
inspection only when a package settlement is reached regarding 
the nuclear issue through DPRK-U.S. talks and when North Korea's 
special status is dissolved. 
  During the news conference held at the second North Korean 
mission in Berlin, Kim Yong-nam emphasized that since the United 
States is the ringleader and offender who introduced the nuclear 
issue to the Korean peninsula and since North Korea is the 
victim, the nuclear issue can be resolved only through talks 
with the United States.

  [Text] Seoul, June 11 (YONHAP) -- The week of June 7-11 saw 
share prices at the Korean stock exchange fluctuate and plummet 
in general over the North Korean nuclear standoff. 
  During the week, the leading composite stock price index 
plunged 11.65 points from 930.26 on June 4 to 918.61 on Saturday. 
  The week started with a crash, influenced strongly by the 
worsening nuclear issue. 
  The index was down 8.54 points on Tuesday from the weekend 
(Monday being a holiday). The plunge was also due to ebbing 
player deposits. 
  On the following day, Wednesday, there was a sharp rebound 
following two straight days of decline. The index jumped 11.30 
points over the previous day to close at 933.02 
  Investors showed optimism as they thought much of the 
nuclear 
dispute's impact had already been absorbed. 
  The rise continued on Thursday when the index picked up 2.77 
points. Once during the day it soared 7.57 points on rumors 
that at the Hong kong stock exchange, players preferred 
Korea-related issues in the expectation of an early resolution 
to the nuclear question. 
  The surge did not last long, however, as the index plunged 
on 
Friday in a wave of selling by wary players. A brake applied by 
the stock exchange to the concentrated buying of specific issues 
by institutional investors also contributed to the decline. 
  On Saturday, the index crashed 10.33 points on reports that 
the International Atomic Energy Agency was adopting sanctions 
against North Korea. 
  During the week, 144.44 million shares or 28.89 million 
shares a day changed hands. During the previous week, volume 
was 175.05 million shares. 
  Institutional investors bought more than they sold in the 
week. Their buying amounted to 857.8 billion won and selling to 
725.3 billion won, representing 27.6 and 23.3 percent, 
respectively, of the total. 
  Players' deposits gained by 43.7 billion won or 1.4 percent 
in the week ending June 9, from 3,041.6 billion won on June 2 to 
3,085.3 billion won. 
  Market analysts said the market would be favorably affected 
by the continuing business recovery, the stability of market 
funds and expected heavy buying by institutional investors. 
  Unfavorable factors facing the market would include the 
lingering nuclear question, signs of labor unrest and the recent 
trend toward increases in international raw material prices and 
monetary interest, the analysts said.

  [Text] Seoul, June 13 (YONHAP) -- The recent series of 
behaviors North Korea showed in the course of nuclear talks have 
fed the suspicion that North Korea actually aims to develop 
nuclear arms instead of seeking to obtain diplomatic gains 
through the nuclear issue, Kim Tok, director of the Agency for 
National Security Planning said on Monday. 
  "It now appears their ultimate aim is to develop nuclear 
arms 
and they are employing a delaying tactics to earn a time," Kim 
said. 
  Speaking at a National Defense Committee session, the 
intelligence chief said his agency has been running an early 
warning system against North Korea around the clock in close 
cooperation with the intelligence networks of Korea's allies. 
  He said that thus far there have been no direct signs of 
military provocation on the part of North Korea, though some 
unusual symptoms such as expanded offensive military exercises 
and the tightened grip of people's control were detected. 
  Saying that the coercive control of people seems to have 
reached a point where it no longer works effectively due to 
mounting difficulties like food and energy crises, Kim said 
there is the danger that North Korea may choose to foment an 
external crisis to sidestep their acute internal problems. 
  "Nonetheless, I believe it would be not easy for the North 
to 
unleash a military provocation because they themselves well know 
a war means their suicide," he said.

  [Text] Seoul, June 11 (YONHAP) -- South Korea, Japan and 
the United States agreed through chain talks Saturday to seek 
phased U.N. sanctions against North Korea. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu met with U.S. Undersecretary 
of 
State Peter Tarnoff and Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa 
and concluded that sanctions are inevitable now when the 
opportunity for measurements from North Korea's nuclear reactor 
is damaged, ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said. 
  Kakizawa, agreeing with Han that close 
Seoul-Tokyo-Washington 
cooperation is necessary in dealing with the North Korean 
situation, made clear that his country will take responsible 
actions "within limits of the Japanese Constitution" when the 
U.N. Security Council decides to act, Chang said. 
  The two foreign ministers also agreed that China's role is 
critical in solving the North Korean nuclear problem. Kakizawa 
said he plans to seek Beijing's active influence when he meets 
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen during his China visit. 
  Kakizawa, moreover, pledged his government's efforts to have 
the G-7 summit next month declare its firm will to deter North 
Korea's nuclear development, Chang said. He apologized for 
former Japanese Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's controversial 
remarks about Tokyo's responsibilities for World War II, saying 
it was "extremely regrettable" to have hurt the feelings of the 
Korean people. 
  Kakizawa and Tarnoff had flown in over the weekend for key 
talks on the North Korean nuclear controversy, on its collision 
course with the U.N. after Pyongyang refused demands by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to have its nuclear 
reactor fuel rods measured by the agency. 
  Foreign Minister Han met earlier in the day with Tarnoff and 
explained President Kim Yong-sam's trip to Russia this month and 
his talks with U.N. and Chinese officials, the spokesman said. 
  Tarnoff had flown in from Tokyo and briefed Han on what he 
discussed with Japanese officials. 
  Han and Tarnoff exchanged views on upcoming Seoul-Pyongyang 
visits by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter next week and 
agreed that the visit should be used as an opportunity to relay 
firm will of the international community to North Korea. 
  They both evaluated the Friday's IAEA resolution as a 
reflection of the hardline stance of the global community 
regarding the North Korean nuclear situation, Chang said.

  [Text] Seoul, June 13 (YONHAP) -- A senior presidential 
secretary said Monday the government favors the imposition of 
step-by-step sanctions on North Korea, responding to reports 
that the United Nations Security Council is considering adopting 
a milder sanctions resolution than originally expected. 
  The secretary said, "South Korea and the United States have 
already agreed on gradual sanctions, and it is wrong to 
interpret these gradual sanctions as appeasement or a retreat." 
  Although the UN resolution would not be strongly worded, he 
added, it would involve practical measures against North Korea 
rather than carrying only symbolic meaning. 
  "The UN Security Council also considered the Chinese 
position, among others, before deciding its course on adopting a 
resolution on gradual sanctions," he said. 
  Reports that China would give military support to North 
Korea 
if war broke out on the Korean peninsula are based merely on 
rumor, he said. 
  Russia has proposed an "eight-way conference" to solve the 
nuclear problem, but it is not a precondition for Moscow's 
participation in sanctions against North Korea, according to the 
official. 
  "I don't think that Russia would oppose the UN Security 
Council resolution on gradual sanctions," he predicted.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Kim Chae-muk: "Who Will Be Victims of </F>
Sanctions Against North Korea?"] 
  [Text] Economic sanctions are one of the means of external 
policy implemented by the international community as a "weapon." 
The purpose of sanctions is to attain a certain "strategic goal" 
by controlling commodities trade between states and blocking the 
flow of capital. 
  Discussion of sanctions against North Korea that the UN 
Security Council undertook on a full scale this week is to 
pursue the same strategy. Its strategic goal is to work out 
measures to ascertain North Korea's nuclear transparency. 
  The question is whether economic sanctions have practical 
effects or not, in other words, whether one can achieve the 
strategic goal of the sanctions, namely "making the leaders of 
the Pyongyang regime give in." 
  In the event that measures to implement sanctions against 
North Korea are finalized in the UN Security Council, sanctions 
by the international community, including the discontinuation of 
trade of weapons and other commodities and blockade of the flow 
of various capital, will be implemented. 
  Nevertheless, it is not clear whether North Korea will give 
in to such sanctions and allow the "nuclear inspection" demanded 
by the international community. 
  We remember a historical fact that the state power 
traditionally uses outside pressure as a means for consolidating 
unity of the people at home. This holds more true for 
dictatorial states. In view of this, the Pyongyang regime may 
shift the pains it will suffer from pressure of the 
international community onto the powerless North Korean people 
and may implement policies for its own survival. 
  Needless today, the effects of sanctions against North Korea 
will not end only in the "North Korean people." In other words, 
there is a great possibility that such pains will be extended to 
South Korea. The negative impact of sanctions will be felt by 
the common people in South Korea more seriously than by the 
rulers. Even at the initial stage of discussions of sanctions at 
the United Nations, the price of "ROK stocks" already showed an 
indication of uneasiness in the international financial markets. 
  When the sanctions are actually implemented, our business 
firms have to bear economic pains. Needless to say, such pains 
will extend to the common people in the ROK. No one can be 
optimistic about the extent of the damages. The 
processing-on-commission-trade between the North and the South, 
though it is still negligible, will be suspended, and external 
credit rating of business firms will be lowered. As a result, 
export-import activities will be drastically reduced. 
  Even if one makes the North Korean regime surrender through 
sanctions, the actual damages the people in the North and the 
South may suffer will not be compensated.

  [Text] Seoul, June 11 (YONHAP) -- Japan will assume all its 
required responsibilities when the U.N. Security Council decides 
on sanctions against North Korea, Seiji Morimoto, Japanese 
Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Saturday. Japan, South Korea 
and the United States did not discuss sanctions outside the 
United Nations at the tripartite talks in Washington, he said. 
  Morimoto gave a press conference at the end of talks between 
Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and his South Korean 
counterpart Han Sung-chu. Kakizawa, who flew into Seoul earlier 
Saturday, called on President Kim Yong-sam. 
  "The Japanese Government did not discuss specifics on 
sanctions against North Korea so far," said Morimoto, "but we 
are discussing the purpose of the sanctions and how to go about 
it within a big framework." 
  The spokesman, as did Kakizawa, denied reports that Tokyo 
was 
passive about the sanctions. 
  Asked about possibility of Japan's rearmament caused by 
North 
Korea's nuclear development, Morimoto reminded that Japan is the 
sole victim of a nuclear bomb. He said Japan will strictly 
adhere to its three principles -- not to develop, possess or 
introduce nuclear weapons. 
  On groups of Japanese Socialist Party lawmakers visiting 
North Korea, Morimoto said they are irrelevant to the stance of 
the Japanese Government. "It is a matter entirely up to each, 
individual lawmaker," he said.

  [Text] Seoul, June 11 (YONHAP) -- Japanese Foreign Minister 
Koji Kakizawa denied press reports that Japan is passive about 
sanctions against North Korea in his talks with President Kim 
Yong-sam, presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik said Saturday. Kim 
met Kakizawa who flew into Seoul earlier and discussed North 
Korea's nuclear situation, Chu said. 
  They agreed that the situation is at a critical point for 
not 
only South Korea and Japan but for the entire Northeast Asia and 
the Pacific region in terms of peace and stability, the 
spokesman said. 
  The Japanese foreign minister promised his country's utmost 
efforts within the boundary of the Constitution to participate 
in U.N. sanctions against North Korea, Chu said after the 
Kim-Kakizawa talks. 
  "The foreign minister said Japan takes the problem as its 
own 
and explained he will deliver such stance when he visits China 
and seek Beijing's cooperation in resolving the problem through 
the United Nations," said Chu. 
  Kakizawa apologized for the controversial remarks by former 
Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano, who said Japan was not an 
aggressor in World War II but just trying to free Asian colonies 
from European grip. "It was wrong for former Minister Nagano to 
say such nonsense and discomfort South Korea," he was quoted as 
saying.

  [Text] Seoul, June 11 KYODO -- Japanese and South Korean 
foreign ministers agreed Saturday [11 June] that sanctions 
against North Korea for its failure to guarantee nuclear 
transparency should be gradual, Japanese officials said. 
  Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and his South Korean 
counterpart Han Sung-chu met for one and a half hours in Seoul 
and confirmed that planned U.N. Security Council sanctions 
against North Korea are aimed at encouraging Pyongyang to hold 
dialogue for a negotiated solution, the officials said. 
  Kakizawa and Han pledged close bilateral cooperation in 
dealing with North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development 
program, they said. 
  The Japanese foreign minister made clear that Japan will 
"make utmost efforts within the Constitution" if the Security 
Council decides to adopt sanctions. 
  Kakizawa dismissed reports that Japan is intransigent on 
taking punitive steps against North Korea, in an apparent denial 
of an article published in THE NEW YORK TIMES on Thursday 
claiming Japan is reluctant to levy sanctions. 
  They also verified a trilateral agreement between Japan, 
South Korea and the U.S. on June 4 that the three countries 
would hold close contact while the U.N. discusses measures. 
  The ministers reiterated that China's role in defusing the 
nuclear crisis is important, saying they must urge China not to 
use its veto when the Security Council votes on sanctions. 
  Kakizawa told Han he will urge China to play an active role 
in settling the nuclear dispute when he visits China on Sunday. 
  In Beijing, Kakizawa is expected to ask Chinese Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen for China's support for a resolution by 
the Security Council against Pyongyang. 
  China has repeatedly expressed hope that the North Korean 
nuclear crisis could be resolved through negotiations. 
  Kakizawa also held a meeting the same day with South Korean 
President Kim Yong-sam, in which Kim said relatively lengthy 
U.N. Security Council discussions on sanctions against North 
Korea may help Pyongyang return to the negotiating table, the 
officials said. 
  Kim called such discussions a meaningful process for urging 
North Korea to make its nuclear program more transparent, they 
said.

  [Text] Seoul, June 13 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
said on Monday that South Korea would cope with the nuclear 
question with flexibility depending on the attitude of North 
Korea under the "grand principle that Pyongyang's nuclear 
development should be checked by all means." 
  "The U.N. Security Council is expected to begin debate on 
the 
nuclear issue beginning this week," Kim said. "I am sure our 
goal would be met satisfactorily step by step." 
  While meeting with the visiting Japanese members of the 
Korea- Japan Parliament Union led by Kazuya Ishibashi, the 
president said the existing cooperative system among South 
Korea, the United States and Japan is essential to thwarting 
North Korea's nuclear program. 
  Discussing his recent visit to Russia, Kim said Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin promised him not to sell weapons to 
North Korea. 
  "The Korean war-related documents Russia handed to us during 
my visit contain so fresh information that some school text 
books on the Korean war would have to be rewritten," the 
president said.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Yi Sok-ku from Tokyo] </F>
  [Text] "The use of nuclear weapons is not against 
international law," according to a clause of a recent Japanese 
Foreign Ministry statement to be submitted to the International 
Court of Justice. 
  The Japanese media gave high coverage of the statement and 
it 
became a political issue in the Diet causing a serious 
controversy. Both opposition and ruling parties of Japan 
strongly opposed the Japanese Government's opinion. 
  Forced to retreat, the Japanese Foreign Ministry deleted the 
clause from the statement without making a juridical judgment 
and said: "The use of nuclear weapons may not conform with the 
humanitarian spirit, which is the basis of international law, 
due to the fatal destruction and massacre power." 
  This was the conclusion made by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
and Foreign Minister Kakizawa Koji after being denounced by the 
Diet. However, the Japanese Foreign Ministry is not changing its 
previous stance that it is legal according to international law. 
  The Japanese Foreign Ministry asserts: "As long as there is 
no treaty prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons, as in the case 
of biochemical weapons, the use of nuclear weapons is not 
against international law." 
  However, this is only the pretext and the real reason is 
that 
"if Japan admits that the use of nuclear weapons is illegal, the 
precondition of Japan's security safeguard would be destroyed 
since Japan depends on the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty as far as 
nuclear deterrence capability is concerned." 
  Taking into account the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, the 
Japanese Government has in fact told the allies on various 
official and unofficial occasions since the sixties that the use 
of nuclear weapons is not against the law. 
  However, things have changed since the end of the Cold War. 
Russia has withdrawn its nuclear weapons, which it had aimed at 
the United States and UK, and the United States and Russia have 
begun to abolish strategic nuclear arms. 
  The North Korean nuclear is the biggest issue now. Foreign 
Minister Kakizawa is silent to the opposition party's question: 
"Does it mean it is not against international law for North 
Korea to use nuclear weapons?" 
  It is clearly anachronistic that the Japanese foreign 
minister is insisting on the old assertion to justify the use of 
nuclear weapons. It also shows that Japan's diplomacy has 
ignored the sentiment of its people and the diplomats only count 
efficiency and national interests. This makes us suspect the 
Japanese Government's hidden intention. Despite the fact that 
the Japanese people are allergic to nuclear weapons because 
Japan is the first country in the world to be bombed by atomic 
bombs, the Japanese Government is insisting on legalizing the 
use of nuclear weapons instead of drawing up a treaty to 
prohibit the use or overall ban on nuclear tests. It is indeed 
unreasonable. 
  We would like to believe that the Japanese Foreign 
Ministry's 
assertion is to provide itself with a basis for possessing 
nuclear weapons in case of an emergency.

  [Text] The place in Berlin where North Korean Foreign 
Minister Kim Yong-nam appeared two days ago and held a news 
conference is an organization called Office for the Protection 
of North Korean Interests. Since North Korea has not 
established diplomatic relations with Germany, it has this 
mission, instead of an embassy, under the pretext of protecting 
its national interests. However, this, in fact, is a base of 
secret intelligence operations, according to a report. 
Correspondent Yi Myong-ku reports from Berlin. 
  [Yi Myong-ku] The North Korean Office for the Protection of 
National Interests occupies part of the former North Korean 
Embassy in the former East Germany. The German intelligence 
agency assumes that this is a base of the North Korean secret 
intelligence agency, and that North Korean officials are using 
this place to procure North Korea's necessities of life and 
foreign currency, newspaper DER TAGESSPIEGEL recently reported. 
  North Korea also obtains military technology through this 
interest mission and buys technologically complex machinery and 
equipment and sends them to North Korea via diplomatic pouch. 
At one time, they also purchased helicopter parts, automatic 
firearms, and ammunition, said DER TAGESSPIEGEL. 
  For the transport of these goods, North Korea uses a Korean 
civil airliner which flies to Berlin, the only place the 
airliner flies in the West. An official from the German Customs 
says he often receives information that the North Korean 
airliner, with only 30 passengers occupying its 165 seats, is 
loaded with profit-making goods, including narcotics and 
hallucinogenic drugs.

  [Text] It was learned on 7 June that a top-secret document 
of the former Soviet Union's KGB shows that North Korean 
President Kim Il-song did not participate in the anti-Japanese 
struggle before Korea's liberation. 
  This is contained in a special article of the January 1992 
edition of INFORMATION AND NATIONAL SECURITY, a U.S. publication 
that specializes in gathering and disclosing secret information. 
The article is entitled "International Espionage Activities 
Mentioned in Top-Secret KGB Documents: 1975-1985." 
  This publication notes that a secret cable dated 20 April 
1978 and addressed to a Soviet espionage network operating in 
Hong Kong says that "even though Kim describes himself as a hero 
who liberated his fatherland from the Japanese imperialists in 
August 1945 by waging a bold partisan struggle, the KGB 
headquarters know very well that he was not in North Korea at 
that time." 
  This cable also says: "When the Soviet forces liberated 
North Korea, Kim was serving as a lieutenant in the Red Army and 
an agent of the NKVD (KGB's predecessor)." It also says that 
the KGB feels a sense of betrayal as well as a sense of contempt 
toward Kim."

<F P=106> [By Kim Song-yong from Hong Kong] </F>
  [Text] Western diplomatic sources in Hong Kong said on 11 
June that China promised to send a ground army of approximately 
85,000 troops to North Korea if a war breaks out on the Korean 
peninsula and, also, to provide credit assistance -- such as 
food and energy -- to the latter if UN economic sanctions are 
affected. 
  The sources said: Such an agreement between China and North 
Korea was discussed between the key leaders of the North Korean 
party and government, who visited China in early June, and the 
relevant high-level officials of the Chinese party and Army. As 
a result, a final agreement was reached during the visit by Choe 
Kwang, chief of the General Staff of the North Korean Army, to 
China on 7 June. 
  Prior to these remarks, a military source in Hong Kong once 
said that according to the China-North Korea Friendly Treaty 
signed in 1961, China has formulated plans to support North 
Korea by sending ground troops between 50,000 and 75,000 
soldiers -- who belong to the three divisions of the 39th 
Shenyang Military District Army stationed in Dalian -- as well 
as approximately 10,000 rapid deployment troops [sinsok 
paechigun] of the Jinan Military District to the latter. The 
source said, however, that China will send its troops to North 
Korea only if North Korea is cornered as a result of an invasion 
by the United States and South Korea, and that if North Korea 
invades South Korea, China will not directly provide military 
support to North Korea, except for spare parts or ammunition for 
the Chinese-made weapons North Korea currently possesses. 
  The sources said: Prior to the China visit by Choe Kwang, 
chief of the General Staff of the North Korean Army, North Korea 
had sent over 10 high-level leaders from each ministry -- such 
as the Workers Party of Korea, the Army, the Ministry of 
People's Armed Forces, the Ministry of Public Security, the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Metal Industry 
-- to Beijing to discuss the issues -- such as China's 
participation in a war if it breaks out on the Korean peninsula, 
as well as its economic support for North Korea if the United 
Nations imposes economic sanctions on North Korea -- with the 
relevant Chinese authorities, including leaders of the Communist 
Party of China and its People's Liberation Army. In return for 
China's support for North Korea, North Korea has proposed that 
it will grant China the right to use the ports in the East Sea 
areas, and that it will provide materials such as nonferrous 
metals and cement to China. 
  They also said: Kim Kyong-hui, younger sister of Kim 
Chong-il, a director of the Light Industrial Department of the 
Workers Party of Korea, visited Beijing in late May to hold 
working-level meetings with the Chinese side in order to discuss 
its economic support for North Korea. She is expected to return 
home around 13 June.

  [Text] Seoul, June 11 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government expressed regret Saturday over the underground 
nuclear test China conducted in the Xinjiang-Uygur Autonomous 
Region on Friday. 
  In an official statement, the Foreign Ministry said it was 
regrettable that China had again carried out a nuclear test at a 
time when all other major nuclear powers are refraining from 
conducting such tests and as active negotiations have been 
underway for a comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT) since 
January. 
  The Chinese test does not contribute to efforts to maintain 
international peace, it said. 
  The South Korean Government urges all nations that possess 
nuclear weapons to stop testing nuclear devices to ensure early 
conclusion of the CTBT, and to refrain from undertaking any 
action that may have a negative impact on the nuclear 
nonproliferation regime, the statement said.

  [Text] Seoul, June 9 (YONHAP) -- Chinese Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation Minister Wu Yi said Thursday his country 
has decided to allow formal imports of Korean-made automobiles. 
  At a meeting with his South Korean counterpart Kim Chol-su, 
Wu said, "We decided to formally import Korean-made automobiles 
although we are in a difficult situation." China's trade 
minister, meanwhile, asked the Korean side to cooperate in 
importing Chinese products. Wu noted that it would be difficult 
for China to import Korean-made vehicles on a cash basis, 
hinting that Beijing wants to import the automobiles on a 
counterpurchase basis. 
  During the meeting, the Korean side demanded that China 
allow 
in 5,000 Korean cars. The Chinese, however, failed to set a 
specific target, according to a Ministry of Trade, Industry and 
Energy official. 
  "We think the export contract will pave the way for formal 
exports of Korean-made automobiles to China," the official said. 
"Daewoo's export contract will not be just a one-time contract 
and domestic manufacturers could export (their cars) to China 
continually." 
  Daewoo Motor Co. has signed a contract with a Chinese firm 
to 
ship out 5,000 Lemans, Espero and Prince autos to China around 
August or September, according to sources.

  [Text] Seoul, June 9 (YONHAP) -- An exchange of public 
servants between South Korea and China will be realized from 
June 28 for the first time in history, the Government 
Administration Ministry said Thursday. 
  The government plans to send 16 grade-five, working-level 
officials to a three-week group training course for public 
servants offered by the Chinese personnel ministry from June 28 
to July 19. 
  The exchange is based on an agreement to expand personnel 
cooperation signed by Seoul and Beijing last March. 
  China will also send about 15 public servants to South Korea 
in early September to attend the central officials training 
institute here, a Ministry official said. 
  The exchange of public officials is designed to promote 
friendly and cooperative relations between the two nations' 
civil servants by widening their knowledge of the other 
country's reform policy.

  [Text] Seoul, June 11 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
met with visiting U.S. Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff 
Friday morning to discuss joint Korea-U.S. action on the North 
Korean nuclear row. 
  During the hour-plus meeting at Chongwadae, they shared the 
view that a resolution on sanctions against North Korea will 
inevitably be adopted by the United Nations Security Council 
  Senior Presidential Press Secretary Chu Ton-sik told 
reporters that President Kim and Tarnoff agreed the firm 
relations between Korea and the United States were easing 
Koreans' anxiety over the nuclear wrangling. 
  Tarnoff said that "despite the escalating tension on the 
Korean peninsula, Koreans are wisely coping with it and this is 
impressive." 
  President Kim offered an explanation: "Korean people are now 
mature enough to trust the government's security policies as the 
government does not exploit security issues for political power 
any more." 
  "Some Americans worry about the security of Korea, but they 
will be relieved to see Koreans' firm security posture and 
maturity," the undersecretary noted. 
  As to former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's planned visit to 
Pyongyang, President Kim expressed some concern. "Kim Il-song is 
likely to utilize Carter's visit as a tactic of dialogue and 
smile toward the Western community," he said. 
  Tarnoff explained President Bill Clinton believes that 
Carter's trip should not be an obstacle to UN Security Council 
sanctions against North Korea. 
  Touching on North Korea's repeated call for direct talks 
with 
the United States, Kim and Tarnoff agreed it was a tactic 
designed to secure the withdrawal of American troops from South 
Korea. 
  Earlier in the day, Tarnoff held talks with Deputy Prime 
Minister Yi Hong-ku on similar issues.

  [Text] Seoul, June 11 (YONHAP) -- U.S. Undersecretary of 
State Peter Tarnoff on Saturday denied former President Jimmy 
Carter will carry any message from Washington to North Korea. He 
also denied speculations that the United States shifted from its 
earlier position and is now willing to engage in Moscow-proposed 
multilateral conference to defuse the North Korean nuclear 
crisis. 
  Tarnoff, heading home after his two-day visit to Seoul, said 
at an airport news conference that the priority focus is to push 
a sanction resolution at the United Nations. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, emerging from 
talks with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, was quoted 
as saying that Washington is willing to positively consider the 
eight-way conference Russia suggested to discuss the North 
Korean nuclear issue. For now, adopting a Security Council 
resolution has to come foremost than any multilateral 
conference, Tarnoff said, adding that the resolution will be 
ready within days. 
  Tarnoff was optimistic about China's cooperation on U.N. 
resolution, saying that Beijing fully understands the 
seriousness of the current situation. Knowing that, China will 
act in harmony as a member of the international community, he 
said. 
  Asked whether Carter will carry any message from President 
Bill Clinton when he visits North Korea next week, the 
undersecretary emphasized that the ex-President goes to North 
Korea as a private citizen. Washington, therefore, has no 
intention to deliver a message through him, he said.

  [Text] Seoul, June 13 (YONHAP) -- Former U.S. President 
Jimmy Carter flew into Seoul Monday in a prelude to his visit to 
North Korea, with the possibility of his mediation in the 
nuclear crisis gaining widespread attention. 
  Carter is visiting the two Koreas as head of his private 
peace center. He meets with South Korean Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu and President Kim Yong-sam before passing through the 
heavily fortified truce village of Panmunjom into the North 
Wednesday [15 June]. 
  He is expected to meet North Korean leader Kim Il-song, who 
is reportedly waiting for Carter to deliver a message to U.S. 
President Bill Clinton on his proposal for defusing the current 
nuclear tensions. 
  The former president will return to Seoul June 18 via 
Panmunjom and hold a press conference before heading back to the 
United States the same day. 
  Carter goes to Pyongyang as the U.N. Security Council 
prepares to circulate a U.S.-drafted resolution seeking punitive 
sanctions against the communist state for reneging on nuclear 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

<F P=106> [Article by New York-based correspondent Kim Sung-yong from </F>
the column "Reporter's Memo Book"] 
  [Text] We feel that the stance taken by the foreign policy 
authorities of the ROK and the United States over the last year 
and three months in dealing with the crisis of the North Korean 
nuclear issue has often been the captive of "subjective 
expectations." When the U.S. CIA made an analysis around the 
end of last year that North Korea may have already completed 
producing one or two nuclear warheads, the foreign policy 
authorities of the ROK and the United States dismissed it, 
saying, "It is a hypothetical scenario assuming the worst 
situation." Then, since last spring, the tone has changed in 
that this analysis could be true. When North Korea began to 
replace the fuel rods last month, the U.S. authorities, thinking 
that North Korea has only one "robot arm" for the replacement of 
fuel rods, said that it would take two to three months for North 
Korea to replace all the fuel rods. However, they were taken by 
surprise when North Korea swiftly replaced the fuel rods in a 
few weeks. Different from the U.S. assessment, North Korea had 
two robot arms. 
  If North Korea reprocesses the fuel rods it has taken out, 
it 
will be able to extract plutonium for four to five nuclear 
warheads by the end of this year. From the large-size reactor 
it will complete as early as next year, North Korea will be able 
to produce plutonium for 10 to 12 nuclear warheads annually in a 
few years. During the inspection last March, it was confirmed 
that new reprocessing facilities were being built in North Korea 
in addition to those in operation. 
  The positions of the ROK and U.S. foreign policy authorities 
as to this situation have been quite relaxed. During his visit 
to New York last February, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu 
stressed dialogue saying, "It will take three to four more years 
for North Korea to pose a practical nuclear threat equipping 
itself with all the detonating devices and delivery means." 
While the North Korean nuclear capability's swiftness has been 
confirmed and North Korea is threatening to withdraw from the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the ROK diplomats are repeating 
the statement that "North Korea is promising to allow all the 
inspections of its nuclear processing in the future." The ROK 
and the United States--which did not mention until recently the 
measures in case sanctions are taken--are raising their voice 
about sanctions after North Korea replaced the fuel rods. It is 
doubtful how much the ROK and the United States are prepared for 
the crisis to be created by the sanctions because the two 
countries had so much optimistic hopes in negotiations for the 
past 15 months. 
  The ROK diplomats, who visited the United Nations recently 
say, "The development toward sanctions resulted from the 
consistent policy we have pursued." However, the present 
development being as horrible as it is, no one will agree to or 
be impressed by the interpretation that the ROK diplomacy has 
been consistent.

  [Text] It was learned on 12 June that the ROK Government 
plans to conduct the ROK-U.S. joint "Ulchi-Focus Lens-94 
exercise" on a large scale for 14 days, from 22 August to 4 
September, to inspect the nation's readiness for mobilization. 
  To inspect the nation's capabilities to mobilize resources 
and recover damages, during the 22-27 Ulchi exercise, the 
government plans to select Seoul as an exhibition city in 
conducting exercises for preparing against disasters, 
stabilizing the people's livelihoods, and maintaining the 
government's functions. 
  According to authorities concerned, government ministries 
will conduct surprise exercises of their own, as well. For 
example, the Ministries of Home Affairs and Transportation will 
conduct an exercise for mobilizing personnel and vehicles; the 
Ministry of Agriculture, Forest, and Fisheries will conduct a 
river-crossing exercise for barges loaded with grain and an 
exercise for distributing grain; the Ministry of Health and 
Social Affairs will conduct an exercise for guarding against 
poisonous gas; and the Ministries of Home Affairs and Trade, 
Industry, and Energy will conduct an exercise for preparing 
against the rupture of electricity, water, and gas supplies.

  [Text] It was learned on 12 June that, in connection with 
aggravated tensions on the Korean peninsula over the North 
Korean nuclear issue, the Defense Ministry is now conducting 
on-the-spot inspections of the state of reserve munitions -- 
such as weapons, ammunition, oil, and food needed for a war -- 
and the supporting system in the Army, Navy, and Air Force. 
  The Defense Ministry has inspected the munitions supply 
system by regularly examining related papers so far, however, it 
is exceptionally conducting actual inspections on it because of 
the seriousness in the situation on the Korean peninsula. 
  Inspection teams dispatched by the ministry to major 
munitions bases throughout the country are now conducting a 
comprehensive inspection of the munitions supply system by 
surveying the thickness of protection walls of warehouses of 
explosive materials, such as ammunition and oil, and the state 
of secured defensive facilities and supply lines. 
  The Defense Ministry will complete the inspection before the 
end of June and will take supplementary measures after finding 
out problems in coping with North Korea's possible intensive 
artillery firing, air raids, and special troop infiltration in a 
war. 
  The ministry will reflect the supplementary measures in the 
operations training for protecting munitions supply facilities 
during the planned Ulchi-Focus Lens exercise in August. 
  A Defense Ministry official said on 12 June: "It is expected 
that, if an all-out war takes place on the Korean peninsula, 
both South and North Korea will strike a serious blow to each 
other in an early stage by mobilizing all their firepower. 
Accordingly, it is necessary for sufficient munitions to be 
supplied." He also said: "According to the result of the 
inspection conducted so far, we have secured enough major 
munitions -- weapons, ammunition, oil, and food -- to carry out 
a war until we have support from outside." 
  Our country is supposed to have major munitions support, 
including weapons and ammunition, from the United States and 
other countries in case of war. It is anticipated that it will 
take at least 45 days for a transport ship carrying military 
supplies from the United States to the ROK. It is learned that 
the ROK keeps reserve war materiel to stand for at least three 
months.

  [Text] Seoul, June 13 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry has 
set its budget for next year at 11,338.8 billion won, a 
12.5-percent rise from this year's 10,753 billion won, and is 
currently holding discussions with the Economic Planning Board 
[EPB]. 
  The ministry announced Monday its operating and maintenance 
budget for next year has been raised by 13.6 percent to 7,997.3 
billion won while the "maintenance for war potential" budget was 
increased to 3,341.5 billion won, up 9.9 percent from this year. 
  If the draft budget is confirmed, the ratio of operating and 
maintenance costs will climb to 70.5 percent of the total budget 
from this year's 69.8 percent while that for combat war 
maintenance costs will drop to 29.5 percent. 
  At the same time, the ministry decided to enhance the 
transparency of budget formulation and implementation by 
disclosing the details of the Yulgok budget in the course of 
deliberations at the EPB and National Assembly. 
  The operating and maintenance budget will be used to improve 
the lives of servicemen through promotion of their morale and 
welfare (540.3 billion won); improvement of treatment for 
soldiers (172.8 billion won); and realization of operating 
expenses for units (65.2 billion won). 
  In particular, the ministry set aside 540.3 billion won to 
boost pay for professional soldiers, increase allowances for 
special-area duty and stabilize housing for long-term servicemen.

  [Text] The Ministry of Home Affairs has decided to conduct 
a civil defense exercise on 15 June focusing on an anti-air raid 
exercise on a nationwide scale, rather than the exercises to 
prepare for disasters that the Home Ministry has focused on to 
date. 
  The 15 June civil defense exercise will consist of the 
sounding of the air-raid siren, residents taking refuge in 
shelters, control of motor vehicles, emergency rehabilitation 
work in preparation for the power outage and the cut-off of the 
water supply, and an exercise to prepare for chemical, 
biological, and radiological warfare. 
  The Home Ministry also has decided to check all the 
facilities in preparation for war, such as some 223,000 shelters 
and some 59,000 emergency water-supply facilities across the 
country. This is the first time that all the war-time shelter 
facilities will be checked across the country. 
  The Home Ministry has also decided to distribute pamphlets 
through neighborhood meetings on 25 June guiding the people as 
to how they should act in a time of war, including a nuclear war. 
  The government has also decided to conduct the Chungmu 
Exercise, a regional general crisis management exercise, in 
Seoul and its vicinity for six days beginning 22 August. Eight 
government ministries, including the Home Ministry, will 
participate in this exercise to be conducted by the State 
Contingency Planning Committee to check the ability to cope with 
disasters, such as power outages, cut-off of water-supply, and 
food shortages.

  [Text] Seoul, June 13 (YONHAP) -- As tension mounts over 
the nuclear dispute with North Korea, the government has decided 
to strengthen the civil defense structure by checking and 
revamping civil defense organizations and facilities. 
  Under the decision made at a Central Civil Defense Council 
Meeting presided over by Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok Monday, the 
government will also increase civil defense-related educational 
and public relations programs to focus public attention on 
national security. 
  An emergency call-up exercise will be conducted Wednesday 
and 
Thursday to check the mobilization status of 6.6 million 
reservists for civil defense. 
  Air-raid shelters, emergency water supply systems and 
warning 
systems will be tested and renovated, if need be, by the end of 
the month in full preparation for any emergencies. 
  The air-raid drill on Wednesday will focus on evacuation to 
shelters, vehicular traffic control, first aid for the injured 
and emergency reconstruction of destroyed facilities. 
  The Ulchi defense exercise slated for late August will serve 
as an overall test of the government's ability to manage a 
crisis -- not only an emergency in the run-up to war but also a 
flood, fire or other disaster. 
  The government should keep the public informed of every 
security development to ensure that they do not fear for their 
safety and willingly participate in civil defense drills, Prime 
Minister Yi told the meeting. 
  Emergency preparations should be carried out in such a 
manner 
that neither will they cause the people excessive uneasiness nor 
will they provide any reason for North Korea to make military 
provocations, he stressed. 
  Attending the meeting were Economic Planning Minister Chong 
Chae-sok, National Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku, Home 
Minister Choe Hyong-u, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and 
Emergency Planning Committee Chairman Chon Yong-taek, among 
others.

  [Text] Seoul, June 9 (YONHAP) -- The government has decided 
to send cultural and sports attaches to six cities in five 
foreign countries. "With President Kim Yong-sam's approval on 
last May 23, we have since early this month been consulting with 
the Foreign Ministry and other related offices on the dispatch 
of cultural and sports attaches," Culture and Sports Minister Yi 
Min-sop told reporters on Thursday. He said a cultural and 
sports attache will be posted to each of New York, Los Angeles, 
Paris, Tokyo, Moscow and Beijing. 
  The attaches will be selected from among those officials 
armed with specialized knowledge and good foreign language 
proficiency in the areas of culture and sports, Yi said. The 
duties of the cultural and sports attaches will be to excavate, 
restore or study Korea's historical relics abroad, support 
overseas cultural, art, sports and youth programs, and assist in 
the protection and exports of Korea's cultural pieces.

  [Text] Seoul, June 10 (YONHAP) -- South Korean automakers 
will soon be turning out 100-percent local content medium-and 
large-sized passenger cars. 
  Hyundai Motor will start production in September of two new 
units of the H-car model, with locally supplied parts and 
components accounting for 98 percent, the Ministry of Trade, 
Industry and Energy said Friday. 
  Equipped with a four-cylinder DOHC (Double Overhead 
Camshaft) 
engine, they will be in the 2,000cc and 2,500cc classes. 
Hyundai has manufactured such key components as engines and 
transmissions and developed body designs for these models, 
ministry officials said. 
  The H-car model's localization rate of 98 percent compares 
with 96.7 percent for Hyundai's 2,000cc DOHC Sonata II model, 
83.2 percent and 89.6 percent for Kia's 2,000cc DOHC Potentia 
and Concord models and 80.5 percent for two Daewoo models -- the 
2,000cc Espero and Prince cars. 
  A Hyundai motor official said his company will import only a 
few parts of the transistor motor and axle for the H-car model 
because imports are cheaper than their local counterparts, 
suggesting that Hyundai will soon be capable of producing 
100-percent local content cars in the 2,000cc and 2,500cc 
classes. 
  Hyundai plans to turn out 13,000 units of the H-car model 
between September and December and increase production to 36,000 
next year for both the domestic and overseas markets.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa has said that as a 
prerequisite to North Korea resuming negotiations with the 
United States, North Korea should first guarantee it will accept 
international nuclear inspections. Kakizawa spoke at the upper 
house Budget Committee session on 10 June in reference to North 
Korea's position that, if U.S.-North Korea talks on the issue of 
suspected nuclear development programs are resumed, it is 
willing to accept inspections by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA). 
  Questioning Kakizawa during the session, Keiji Kajiwara of 
the Social Democratic Party of Japan noted North Korean Foreign 
Minister Kim Yong-nam has said his country is willing to accept 
nuclear inspections if U.S-North Korean negotiations resume. 
And, Kajiwara asked how the Japanese Government views this. 
  Kakizawa said there exist differences of view between the 
United States and North Korea over the questions of resuming 
U.S.-DRPK talks and the timing of IAEA inspections. He said the 
matter should be settled in a way to guarantee nuclear 
inspections by the IAEA. 
  Kakizawa thus said that as far as Japan is concerned, 
nuclear 
inspections must come first before North Korea and the United 
States resume their talks.

  [Text] Hamamatsu, June 11 KYODO -- Japan will continue 
efforts via China to persuade North Korea to change its stance 
on the suspected nuclear weapons development program, the chief 
government spokesman said Saturday [11 June]. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai, in a lecture in 
this 
central Japanese city, said there is "a strong possibility" that 
the United Nations Security Council will adopt a resolution 
against North Korea in a week or 10 days unless Pyongyang 
reconsiders its stance on the issue. 
  Kumagai said Japan's basic policy will remain unchanged over 
the issue, as the government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata has 
resolved. 
  He noted the absence of China's objection to a sanctions 
resolution adopted Friday by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency against North Korea. China abstained instead of voting 
against it. 
  Kumagai also said the nuclear issue poses to Japan a policy 
choice of whether to continue or abandon 50 years of alliance 
with the United States since the end of World War II.

  [Text] Commenting on possible sanctions against the DPRK 
(North Korea) because of its suspected development of nuclear 
arms, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said at a meeting of the House 
of Councillors' Budget Committee this morning that it would be 
difficult under the constitution for Japan to take part even in 
nonmilitary measures, if they formed an integral part of 
military action. 
  [Begin Hata recording] In terms of rear support, we will be 
able to offer medical services or other forms of assistance 
after hostilities have ended -- such as, for instance, the 
minesweeping operations we did after the Gulf War. However, 
operations which are an integral part of military action or the 
use of force will be very difficult. [end recording] 
  Prime Minister Hata's remarks indicated that under the 
constitution, it would be difficult for Japan to participate 
even in nonmilitary operations which are an integral part of 
military action. 
  Commenting further on intragovernmental deliberations on 
responding to a United Nations decision to impose sanctions, 
Hata said that while Japan was still persuading DPRK to seek a 
solution through dialogue, it might give the wrong message to 
North Korea to make public the detailed substance of such 
deliberations.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 11 KYODO -- North Korea is unlikely to 
change its hard-line stance with the resolution adopted by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to suspend technical 
aid for its refusal to accept full nuclear inspections, Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] sources said Saturday. 
  The IAEA action could affect the UN Security Council, 
however, on its deliberations on possible economic sanctions on 
North Korea, the sources said. 
  In an overwhelming vote of 28-1, the Vienna-based IAEA 
adopted the resolution, setting in motion the first punitive 
step by the UN nuclear watchdog agency against North Korea. 
  The Japanese Government welcomed the IAEA action as the 
international community's expression of concern against the 
North. 
  But Pyongyang could "not care less" about the suspension of 
the IAEA's technical aid, which amounted to 270,000 dollars in 
1993, the Foreign Ministry source said. 
  The government expects the action will have some influence 
on 
potential UN sanctions against North Korea, and Japan is 
determined to persuade China not to exercise a veto if the 
measure is put to a vote at the Security Council, the sources 
said. 
  China, a key ally of North Korea, has a veto power on a 
resolution as one of the five permanent security council members. 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said Friday night he thinks the 
row over North Korea's suspected nuclear development program has 
become increasingly tense, saying, "we cannot put off (taking 
actions) forever." 
  Hata told reporters, however, that the IAEA measures are not 
"a punishment" and that Japan still hopes the issues will be 
resolved through dialogue among concerned nations.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 11 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa left Saturday for South Korea and China to hold talks 
with his counterparts on ways to deal with a deepening crisis 
over North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons program. 
  Kakizawa is expected to use his talks Saturday with South 
Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and South Korean President 
Kim Yong- sam to reconfirm a determination among Japan, South 
Korea and the United States to get tough on Pyongyang and 
prepare punitive action against its secretive nuclear program. 
  South Korea may brief Kakizawa on Kim's visit to Russia and 
Uzbekistan and Han's visit to New York and Beijing, Japanese 
Foreign Ministry officials predicted. 
  In Beijing on Sunday, Kakizawa will ask Chinese Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen for China's support for a resolution by the 
UN Security Council against Pyongyang, Foreign Ministry 
officials said. 
  China has repeatedly expressed hope that the North Korean 
nuclear crisis could be resolved through negotiations. 
  Japanese, South Korean and U.S. officials are counting on 
the 
powerful UN panel to move on the resolution as early as next 
week. 
  Kakizawa and his South Korean and Chinese counterparts will 
also take up other issues, including the summit of the Group of 
Seven (G- 7) economic powers in Naples, Italy in July.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
said Monday that Japan can engage only in nonmilitary support in 
UN or other multinational forces operations in the event of an 
international crisis. 
  Hata made the remark at a meeting of the House of 
Councillors 
Budget Committee in reply to Makoto Taneda, legislator from the 
Social Democratic Party, the No. 2 opposition party. 
  "Medical services or minesweeping following the end of 
fighting, such as those Japan carried out in the Persian Gulf, 
could be possible," Hata said when asked what kind of support 
Japan can provide. "But it would be extremely difficult to 
engage in those united with military actions." 
  As for the right of collective security in the UN Charter, 
Takao Ode, director general of the cabinet legislation bureau, 
said Japan owns the right as a sovereign state, but cannot 
execute it because of the constitution that renounces war. 
  "The pacifism and the spirit of international cooperation in 
the preamble of the constitution agree with the ideas in the UN 
Charter," Ode said. "Japan will do its duty within the 
Constitution, and cannot use, or threaten to use, forces banned 
in Article 9 of the Constitution." 
  Regarding possible UN sanctions against North Korea over its 
suspected nuclear development program, Hata declined to say what 
steps Japan can take in the sanctions because of an anxiety "of 
sending the wrong message" to North Korea. 
  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told the same session Japan 
and South Korea have agreed that the sanctions should not be 
punitive, but should be those urging North Korea to return to a 
safeguard system of the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  Hata told reporters earlier in the day that Japan supports 
the resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue through 
dialogue. 
  Meanwhile, a government source said Japan cannot take the 
initiative and needs to "give priority to the intentions of 
South Korea."

  [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- The Iranian Embassy in 
Tokyo on Monday [13 June] denied as "absurd" an allegation that 
Iran has test-fired Nodong missiles supplied by North Korea and 
insisted that Tehran's nuclear program is "peaceful." 
  Iranian Ambassador to Japan Hoseyn Kazempur-Ardabili, in a 
letter dated Monday and received the same day, took issue with a 
KYODO NEWS SERVICE story Sunday that had said Japan is 
reportedly pressuring Iran to stop test-firing the North 
Korean-made missiles. 
  The story quoted the latest edition of the U.S. NEWS AND 
WORLD REPORT as saying the Japanese Government is threatening to 
suspend financial assistance to a 1.2 billion dollar dam project 
in Iran unless Tehran stops the missile testing. 
  The envoy said the missile allegation "has been denied time 
and again at the highest level of my government and Japanese and 
South Korean officials have been amply and convincingly assured 
of (its) absurdity." 
  He said that raising it at the time, with the growing 
tension 
on the Korean peninsula and concern about it in Japan, "is 
another attempt to undermine the friendly relations between Iran 
and Japan."

    [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in 
Japanese at 2230 GMT on 11 June carries in its "News 2001" 
program a live 68-minute interview with Shinseito (Japan Renewal 
Party) Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa on the DPRK nuclear issue 
and Japan's political situation by FNN announcers Yuji Kuroiwa 
and Megumi Sekito, Keio University Professor Yoshiaki, and 
political commentator Kenichi Takemura at the FNN studio in 
Tokyo. 
  At 2309 GMT, Kuroiwa begins the interview by asking Ozawa 
for 
his opinion on the present DPRK situation. Ozawa says: "I do 
not think they are changing their basic position. But when we 
discuss and review the matter, we must try and use dialogue to 
bring them to a compromise and a change in their policy. That 
would be the best, and we will have to do our best towards that. 
But if we have done all that, and if things still do not go 
well, we will have to take a firm stand." 
  He adds: "Maybe the DPRK sees some political significance in 
owning nuclear arms; anyway, I do not think they are giving up 
their position yet." 
  Kuroiwa asks whether Japan, the United States, and the ROK 
should join together to mete out sanctions against the DPRK if 
the United Nations fails to agree on sanctions. Ozawa says: "I 
do not think China will reject or exercise its veto right (on a 
UN proposal for sanctions). China will gain nothing by doing 
so, and it is possible that China itself may become isolated 
(from the international community). I do not think it will do 
such a foolish thing." 
  Speaking on alleged differences of opinions on how sanctions 
against the DPRK should be implemented, Ozawa says: "It is only 
natural that they be implemented step by step. It is not that 
Japan, the United States, and the ROK differ on the question of 
implementing them step by step, but rather, I think there are 
some differences in opinion on what types of sanctions should be 
implemented in a step by step manner." 
  Even before the United Nations formally passes a resolution 
on sanctions, he notes the possibility of other nations calling 
on Japan to take action to discontinue commodity trade and money 
remittances to the DPRK. He explains: "I am afraid about the 
possibility that Japan, as it is, will not be able to do 
anything when that happens." He adds: "What I am worried about 
most is the possibility Japan will lose trust in the 
international community. I think damages to Japan (if it cannot 
take the called-for actions) could be such that they will not be 
repaired even in the next scores of years or next several 
generations. Hence, I think, action in the preliminary stages 
will be very important and tough for Japan." 
  Professor Kobayashi asks Ozawa if he thinks Japan should 
agree to the U.S. proposal that Japan, the United States, and 
the ROK join together to punish the DPRK economically if the 
United Nations is unable to agree on sanctions. Ozawa says: "So 
far I have said that Japan should act only in accordance with UN 
resolutions when compulsive actions are concerned. But what is 
being discussed and called for now are preliminary actions that 
involve domestic matters, such as halting money remittances and 
regulating visits. These are not actions that cannot be carried 
out without a UN resolution. That being the case, Japan is in a 
very difficult position." 
  When asked about Japan's crisis management capability under 
the Shinseito led coalition government, Ozawa states: 
"Officials of concerned government agencies are studying 
various fields very hard. However, neither the government nor 
the Diet openly discuss this issue. The government has no 
official position on the subject, that is the actual situation 
in today's Japan. While I think some quarters in the government 
are continuing informal studies, we are not yet prepared to have 
an improved system." In regards to this, Ozawa expresses 
concern over Japan's taboo to fully discuss defense issues, and 
says: "In particular, the mass media still deal with important 
topics in very old-fashioned ways. Such a tendency by Japanese 
society creates a national crisis." 
  In response to Kurosawa's comment that Japan seemingly has a 
consensus to deal with the DPRK issue within the Constitution's 
limitations, Ozawa notes: "Many people have a different 
definition of constitutional limitations. For instance, the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) says, under 
constitutional limitations, Japan must not take part in any 
compulsive actions, even indirectly. In their opinion, Japan is 
not allowed to supply provisions or fuel to U.S. Forces in case 
of emergency since it aids in compulsive actions or military 
force. Even if the nation has a consensus on actions within the 
constitutional limitations, there is no accord on the definition 
of the limitations." 
  [Editorial Report] When Kuroiwa asks if Japan, under 
Oazawa's constitutional concept, can assist U.S. Forces with 
regard to the DPRK issue, Ozawa answers: "In my own 
understanding of Article 9 of the Constitution, the Japanese 
Government must not, at is own judgment, be allowed to dispatch 
the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to any international dispute. 
Article 9 strictly prohibits such behavior. On the other hand, 
the Constitution's main concept is international pacifism. When 
the United Nations has a clear policy for certain disputes and 
member nations agree to jointly conduct law enforcement or peace 
activities, that does not conflict with the Constitution at all. 
That is my understanding." 
  Asked if the government intends to fully cooperate with 
anti-DPRK sanctions if imposed at the United States' initiative, 
Ozawa says: "I do not think so. My opinion is that, when 
compulsive forces are to be used, Japan must take part in the 
actions only within the framework of the United Nations. 
However, controlling money remittances from Japan to the DPRK 
is a matter of Japan's domestic economic policy. Since this has 
nothing to do with Article 9 of the Constitution, we have to 
take necessary actions in consultations with the United States 
and the ROK. When the United Nations clearly decides to impose 
sanctions against the DPRK and asks member nations to support 
the sanctions, as a matter of course, Japan will have to assist 
with its SDF or all other possible means because it is an event 
in Japan's neighboring region." 
  In reply to a question asking if Japan should be admitted to 
the UN Security Council (UNSC) as a permanent member with a 
limited military role, Ozawa says: "If Japan becomes a 
permanent UNSC member, it should meet the same qualification as 
other members. But I do not really think Japan should seek such 
a position. The UNSC is an organization to deal with 
international security. I think Japan has neither the 
determination nor public consensus to obtain the position. It 
is too much for today's Japan, although Japan has strong 
economic power." Ozawa adds: "What Japan can do would depend 
on individual cases, but if Japan becomes a permanent UNSC 
member, it cannot stay away from what everybody else does. The 
international community would never accept such a foolish offer. 
If Japan says so, it would become a standing joke in the world. 
If Japan wants to stay away from certain UNSC duties, it had 
better not become a permanent member." 
  When asked if the minority Hata administration can survive 
the difficult political situation, Ozawa says: "While people 
often say the Hata administration is in trouble because it is a 
minority government, I am not worried. If we really had a 
serious problem, the administration would have collapsed 
already. However, nobody can draw a picture of the post-Hata 
political scene. The Liberal Democratic Party is not united in 
backing Mr. (Yohei) Kono as the next prime minister, and neither 
is the SDPJ. Under such circumstances, we should not be 
scrupulous about winning back the majority. This is the time 
for all politicians to overcome party barriers and to seek 
policy-oriented allies. 
  In connection with Ozawa's positive stance on the SDPJ 
rejoining the coalition, Kuroiwa asks if the coalition would 
have a clearer policy accord when discussions are held on the 
SDPJ's return, Ozawa says: "If we had a clearer policy accord, 
it would put the SDPJ in a difficult position. I am positive 
about clarifying coalition policies if the SDPJ agrees to it."

  [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- Japan has made no decision 
on whether or not it will suspend economic assistance to China 
after it conducted an underground nuclear test last Friday [10 
June], Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito said Monday. 
  Saito told a press conference the government has not yet 
made 
a decision on whether it should immediately change its Official 
Development Assistance (ODA) policy toward China. 
  He said Japan has conveyed its concern about the test and 
explained again the contents of its ODA guidelines hammered out 
in 1992, which state that recipient countries should promote 
disarmament. 
  Japan will continue to urge China to stop conducting nuclear 
tests, he said. 
  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa suggested in Beijing on 
Sunday 
that China's nuclear test could influence Tokyo's future loans 
to China.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- Some leaders of the 
governing coalition Monday [13 June] stepped up their bid to 
entice the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) 
into their camp to create a new stable conservative government. 
  The top coalition strategist, Ichiro Ozawa, told a news 
conference, "whether (possible partners) include the LDP or 
others, we had better discuss (the possibility of forming an 
alliance) openly, if only we can narrow our policy gaps to reach 
an agreement." Ozawa said, however, the ruling coalition might 
not be able to integrate all LDP legislators into its fold, 
saying, "the LDP has a variety of legislators whose ideas on 
diplomacy and domestic policies differ completely with each 
other." "Primarily, I want to reconcile policy differences with 
the Social Democratic Party (SDP)" to form an alliance, said the 
secretary general of Shinseito, a key coalition party. The 
coalition must work out a "more specific agreement" than the 
April 22 policy platform accord among coalition leaders in order 
to counteract the increasingly tense nuclear standoff on the 
Korean peninsula, he said. 
  In the April 22 common policy agreement, coalition partners 
used fuzzy language to gloss over sharp gaps on tax system 
reforms and Japan's response to North Korea's suspected nuclear 
arms development. 
  Kansei Nakano, new secretary general of the Democratic 
Socialist Party, another coalition party, told a separate news 
conference the coalition wants to entice into its fold "the SDP 
primarily, but we are not limiting options of our possible 
partners to the SDP alone." 
  Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa called for quick 
policy coordination inside the coalition, saying, "even if we 
tried to appeal to the LDP to come to our camp, we would not be 
able to do so without working out a (more clear-cut common 
policy accord.)" The LDP responded to these calls with 
conflicting voices. 
  Former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe said he perceived it 
as a good idea to bring together conservative forces inside both 
the LDP and the ruling coalition, saying, "I prefer to push an 
orthodox approach" under which people of similar political ideas 
form a political bloc. 
  LDP President Yohei Kono urged the ruling coalition to 
"first 
declare" that they will stop talking with the SDP on a possible 
merger before seeking to entice the LDP into its fold. He told 
a news conference in Gifu, Gifu Prefecture, "I cannot believe 
their proposal deserves our serious response in view of their 
approach which appears to be (made through) deceptive tactics." 
  Meanwhile, the coalition's secretaries general agreed that 
the critical criteria for forming an alliance with any partners 
should be whether the coalition and such partners can alleviate 
policy gaps on tax reforms and Japan's response to the North 
Korean nuclear issue. They also agreed to start discussions 
next week on working out a more specific policy accord on these 
two points, including the issue of how sharply the government 
should raise the rate of the consumption tax from the current 3 
percent. 
  The ruling coalition is under strong parliamentary fire from 
the SDP and some LDP legislators, including Kono, who urged it 
to take a softer approach toward North Korea over the nuclear 
standoff.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 11 KYODO -- Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary 
general of the Soka Gakkai-backed Komeito, called on the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ -- of Social Democratic Party of 
Japan] Saturday [11 June] to return to the ruling coalition to 
help stabilize Japanese politics. 
  In a speech to senior officials of Komeito's prefectural 
chapters from across the country, Ichikawa rejected calls within 
the SDP for prime minister Tsutomu Hata's cabinet to voluntarily 
quit. 
  But Ichikawa praised the second largest opposition party for 
exploring the possibility of its returning to the coalition, 
which it bolted in April over the abrupt formation of "Kaishin 
(Innovation)" by other coalition partners, including Hata's 
Shinseito, Komeito and the Democratic Socialist Party. 
  The Komeito official criticized the Liberal Democratic Party 
for hinting at introducing a no-confidence motion against the 
Hata administration and cautioned the SDP against going along 
with the LDP on the matter.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) President Yohei Kono may not be the logical choice for the 
next prime minister to lead a new coalition government joined by 
the LDP, a senior LDP member said Monday [13 June]. 
  "President Kono is the LDP's best candidate," said Koichi 
Kato, an ex-chief cabinet secretary of a now-deposed LDP 
government, at a news conference. 
  "But it is impossible for the LDP to form a government by 
itself and we need to put together a coalition," he said. "We 
should therefore seriously weigh the possibility of installing 
someone from non-LDP forces (as the next premier)." 
  Kato, who heads a policy study group within the LDP dubbed, 
"Group New Century," is a known archrival of Kono and has been a 
staunch critic of the current LDP leadership. 
  Describing the current administration of Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata as a weak regime that cannot win trust domestically 
or internationally, the vocal lawmaker said the LDP should map 
out a clear-cut strategy for creating a new, stable government 
and demand Hata's resignation. 
  To fashion a fresh government with the participation of 
broader political forces, the LDP, ousted from power last summer 
for the first time in 38 years, needs to discuss with other 
major political parties whether they can govern together, Kato 
said. 
  But he took a dim view of the LDP's tie-up with Shinseito 
unless Ichiro Ozawa, the ruling coalition's back room deal 
maker, gives up the idea of running politics from behind the 
scenes.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 11 KYODO -- Former Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa urged members of the Japan New Party (JNP) on 
Saturday to take the lead in an expected further realignment of 
political forces under the new electoral system. 
  Hosokawa told a party convention of its representatives 
nationwide that "the JNP should play a pioneering role in the 
second stage of political realignment even with a resolution to 
dissolve the party for the sake of reform." 
  Hosokawa also demanded that the opposition Social Democratic 
Party (SDP) [SDPJ -- Social Democratic Party of Japan] return to 
the ruling coalition, saying, "if the SDP decides to join hands 
with us, we will not spare any effort (to bring that about)." 
  The national convention is the first since the JNP was 
established in May 1992. 
  More than 70 members of both Diet chambers and 
representatives from local chapters attended the meeting, at 
which they will set the party's key policies and reappoint 
Hosokawa as party leader. 
  Hosokawa told reporters Friday [10 June] night that the 
parliamentary group "Kaishin," of which the JNP is a member, is 
likely to evolve into a new party within a few months. 
  He said Kaishin, whose members include the JNP, Shinseito 
(Japan Renewal Party) and Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), will 
seek broad participation, including the SDP, the largest 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the new party 
Sakigake. 
  He said before Kaishin becomes a political party, it needs a 
few months until a new electoral map is drawn for 300 
single-seat districts under the new electoral system. 
  A new political reform law for the lower house enacted in 
January calls for electing 300 legislators from single-seat 
districts and 200 via proportional representation. 
  On allegations that he received 100 million yen as illegal 
donations from the Sagawa Kyubin trucking business group, 
Hosokawa told the JNP convention that Diet testimony by his 
former aide Masatoshi Miyama will show his innocence. 
  Upon demand by opposition parties, Miyama is to testify 
under 
oath Wednesday at the House of Representatives budget committee 
on the money scandal. 
  Hosokawa's questionable personal finances led his 
resignation 
as premier in April in part to take responsibility for a delay 
in Diet deliberations on the fiscal 1994 state budget. 
  "Through the testimony by my former secretary Miyama, I 
think 
(the opposition) can understand what I have said," Hosokawa said. 
  Hosokawa has repeatedly denied charges that the money was an 
illicit donation, saying he took the 100 million yen from Sagawa 
as a loan in 1982 and had repaid it with interest by 1991.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 11 KYODO -- Former Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa was reelected as chief of the Japan New Party 
(JNP) on Saturday [11 June] and urged the party to be ready to 
dissolve itself for the sake of political reconfiguration and 
reform. 
  Addressing the JNP's national convention, Hosokawa said the 
party should "play a pioneering role in the second stage of 
political realignment even with a resolution to dissolve the 
party for the sake of reform." 
  Hosokawa also vowed the party's utmost efforts to bring the 
Social Democratic Party (SDP) back to the ruling coalition as 
part of efforts to jointly tackle a number of issues of 
immediate concern. 
  "If the SDP decides to join hands with us, we will not spare 
any effort to lay the groundwork for its return to the 
coalition," said Hosokawa, who resigned the premiership in April 
to take the blame for his alleged financial improprieties. 
  The national gathering, the first since the JNP set up shop 
in May 1992, brought together over 70 members of both houses of 
the Diet and representatives from local chapters of the party. 
  At the convention, the JNP approved its action plan for 1994 
in which the party promised to seek the dissolution of the 
parliamentary group Kaishin, of which the JNP is a member, while 
groping for a strong political power base with other parties. 
  The SDP, now the second-largest opposition force, walked out 
of the coalition in April in protest against the formation of 
Kaishin by other coalition partners without the SDP. The SDP's 
departure forced Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to form the first 
minority government since 1955. 
  The JNP also approved the new leadership under Hosokawa. 
Satsuki Eda, former leader of the United Social Democratic 
Party, a minor political force that disbanded in May, and Yuriko 
Koike were elected the party's deputies, while Masuo Matsuoka 
was retained as representative secretary general. 
  At a news conference held after the party meeting, Hosokawa 
spoke of the need for coalition parties to take a united front 
in achieving administrative and economic reforms by setting 
aside key policy differences. 
  "We are now in a state of emergency," he said. "We must ride 
out the stormy weather at sea." 
  Hosokawa expressed hope the Diet testimony by his former 
aide 
Masatoshi Miyama will help dispel allegations that he received 
100 million yen in illegal donations from a scandal-tainted 
trucking firm. Hosokawa says the money was a loan he repaid 
later. 
  He also said he will testify before the Diet himself if the 
legislature decides to summon him as a sworn witness. 
  Miyama is to testify under oath on the money scandal at the 
House of Representatives budget committee on Wednesday. 
  Hosokawa has repeatedly denied charges that the money was an 
illicit political contribution, saying he accepted the 100 
million yen from the Sagawa Kyubin group in 1982 and had repaid 
it with interest by 1991.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- Japan's economy has moved 
"one step" toward recovery, but some concern still remains, such 
as the yen's rise, Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said 
Monday [13 June]. 
  "Assessing the recent economic indicators, there seems to be 
high chances that the economy has moved one step toward a 
recovery," Mieno told the Budget Committee of the House of 
Councillors. 
  The governor said the "one step" was from his latest 
assessment that the economy is "showing signs of bottoming out." 
  Mieno cited brighter signs in personal consumption, 
inventory 
adjustments and exports, particularly to Southeast Asian 
nations, and noted that corporate concern about having a surplus 
of facilities and equipment has "hit a ceiling." 
  His comments came after the central bank released Friday its 
quarterly "Tankan" report on business sentiment that showed 
improvement in confidence by both major manufacturers and 
nonmanufacturers for the first time in five years. 
  Asked about the effects of the 5.5 trillion yen income tax 
cuts, Mieno said he expects the cuts to "support the economy 
that is showing slight brightness." 
  But Mieno said he remains uncertern if the economy has moved 
"two or three steps forward," noting such prevailing concerns as 
the yen's rise, sluggish corporate capital investment and 
competition from other Asian nations. 
  As for capital investment, however, he said the environment 
for a recovery is improving, and stressed that declines in 
interest rates since the central bank cut its official discount 
rate to an all-time low of 1.75 percent last year are still 
supporting corporate restructuring efforts. 
  The central bank intends to continue carefully watching to 
see whether the recent bright spots spread to the economy as a 
whole, Mieno said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- Recent economic indicators 
have presented "signs for the economy to recover," Vice Finance 
Minister Jiro Saito said Monday [13 June]. 
  "Our assessment is not much different from the Bank of 
Japan," Saito told reporters, agreeing to earlier comments by 
central bank governor Yasushi Mieno that the economy is poised 
to take the recovery path. 
  However, Saito, like Mieno, remained cautious, saying, "We 
still can't declare with confidence that the economy will head 
toward a recovery." 
  Mieno told the Budget Committee of the House of Councillors, 
"assessing the recent economic indicators, there seems to be a 
high possibility that the economy has moved one step toward a 
recovery." 
  His comments were a step forward from his latest assessment 
that the economy is "showing signs of bottoming out," after the 
central bank released its quarterly "Tankan" business sentiment 
survey for may on Friday showing broad-based improvement for the 
month for the first time in five years. 
  Asked about the effects from continuing 5.5 trillion yen 
worth of income tax cuts, Mieno said he expects to "support the 
economy that is showing brightness." 
  But Mieno said he does not know if the economy has moved 
"two 
or three steps" forward, noting such prevailing concerns as the 
yen's rise, corporate capital investment and competition with 
other Asian nations.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Vice Minister Tsutomu 
Tanaka of the Economic Planning Agency [EPA] said Friday [10 
June] the Bank of Japan's [BOJ] quarterly economic survey 
released earlier in the day reflected steady progress toward 
recovery of the domestic economy. 
  Tanaka told a news conference the survey, known as Tankan, 
was a "big plus factor" for the domestic economy and the agency 
hopes the government's stimulus measures will lead to 
full-fledged recovery. 
  He cited sluggish capital investment plans by medium and 
small enterprises as a minus factor which can be traced to 
growing investment overseas by manufacturers. 
  Tanaka said the central bank report was one of the factors 
for judging domestic economic trends and that the agency will 
take all such factors into account in making its own assessment 
of the economy.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- Japan's long-slumping 
economy has gotten "much better" but a bottom to the recession 
cannot be confirmed yet, the government's top economic planner 
Yoshio Terasawa said Monday [13 June]. 
  "The economy looks much better and I don't think the economy 
will go much worse than it is now," said Terasawa, director 
general of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA). 
  But on whether the 37-month downturn has hit bottom, "I 
should say that I don't know yet. All the figures I have are 
six weeks old, seven weeks old," he said, answering questions in 
English after a speech to foreign correspondents. 
  Of the uncertainties hanging over the economy, he cited the 
dollar-yen rate and corporate capital spending, expected to fall 
for a fourth straight year. "Should there be any signs that 
equipment investments start increasing, then I really think the 
economy...will catch up." 
  Terasawa said his agency is not more cautious on the economy 
than the Bank of Japan. Yasushi Mieno, the central bank 
governor, told lawmakers earlier Monday that the economy likely 
has passed bottom and taken the first step toward recovery. 
  "Each agency here in Japan, being independent, can have its 
own opinion," he said. But he added that he met Mieno during 
the day and, "it seems that his view and mine are very very 
close, if not almost exactly the same." 
  Terasawa continued his recent calls for deregulation and 
reducing the "ridiculously profound disparities" between 
Japanese and foreign prices. 
  Prices can be cut, regulations eased and multilayered 
distributions systems simplified without severe unemployment, 
asserted Terasawa, who spent more than 20 years as a businessman 
overseas, much of it as a top executive for Nomura Securities Co. 
  But he did not explain how, offering only that there were 
"too many go-betweens" in the Japanese economy and that some 
people must "take disadvantages" in deregulation. 
  He rejected a suggestion that the nation's high prices 
either 
represent profiteering or are the cost of the traditional 
lifetime employment system, saying, "it's not that simple." 
  Terasawa acknowledged that it is "not easy" to overcome 
bureaucratic opposition to deregulation but said, "we have to do 
it, no matter how difficult." 
  He declined to criticize the Ministry of Finance (MOF) when 
prodded by charges that the ministry's powerful bureaucrats take 
money out of citizens' pockets by pushing for tax hikes and 
stifling attempts to cut prices. 
  "MOF is not our enemy, they're our friends," Terasawa said. 
"I don't think MOF people are trying to dominate or trying to 
lead the country" by insisting on fiscal rectitude. 
  Asked who would push for needed changes, the Japan New Party 
upper house member chirped, "the Hata cabinet." He skirted the 
question of how long Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's government 
will last, but joked at the start of his speech that he hoped to 
keep his job long enough to see his Monday comments in print.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 12 KYODO -- Despite increasing signs of 
a fledgling economic recovery as shown by government and Bank of 
Japan reports, anxiety still persists among business leaders, in 
particular those of basic-materials industries. 
  The lingering concern stems in part from low levels of 
prices 
for their products. 
  But some businesses are not worried by the recession. 
  "I don't feel any slump in consumption," said an official of 
a Tokyo discount store near JR Kanda Station. 
  The area is widely known as the hub of discounters, where 
foreign-made golf gear sell for 30,000 yen per set against 
suggested retail prices of around 100,000 yen. Air conditioners 
are priced at 80,000 yen against the makers' suggested 210,000 
yen. 
  Those who buy goods there, by and large, are amazed by the 
low prices. 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata last month proposed that the 
government should double real national incomes by lowering 
prices of goods. 
  The proposal, made at an unofficial meeting of cabinet 
ministers on May 24, touched off a barrage of criticisms from 
the business community, however. 
  This is largely because business leaders fear that such a 
policy, if implemented, would result in the collapse of prices, 
thereby squeezing corporate sales and eventually contracting the 
Japanese economy as a whole. 
  Said Yoshihiko Miyauchi, president of Orix Corp., Japan's 
largest leasing firm, "a fall in prices translates into a 
slowdown in business activity." 
  The Japanese economy faces a danger of falling into "a 
deflationary spiral," he warned. 
  Many other corporate executives agree. The view is gaining 
ground among businesses that they need to blunt the rippling 
effects of lower prices. 
  Japanese consumers are becoming more price-conscious and 
seeking lower-priced goods, prompted in part by the yen's steep 
appreciation which make imports less expensive. 
  By contrast, corporate executives are increasingly concerned 
over the risk of deflation. 
  Hajime Sakamoto, a director of Mitsui Petrochemical 
Industries Ltd., observed that consumer preference for 
lower-priced goods makes it hard to feel an economic comeback 
although the economy may have hit bottom in quantitative terms. 
  Kagehide Kaku, head of the Bank of Japan's Research and 
Statistics Department, forecast prices will remain at low levels 
for a while, although an economic recovery usually gives rise to 
the possibility of inflation. 
  The market mechanism is now in motion toward a narrowing of 
price gaps between Japan and abroad, accelerating the downward 
pace of domestic prices that are already lower than before due 
to the protracted recession. 
  Mitsuo Ohashi, managing director of comprehensive chemical 
maker Showa Denko K. K., said, "it's only natural that the 
internationalization of the Japanese economy should lead to 
higher imports." 
  "But, domestic prices will continue a downward spiral unless 
the yen's ascent is halted, and a strong economic recovery is 
not expected," he added.

<F P=106> ["DPRK Will Immediately Withdraw From IAEA and Regard UN </F>
`Sanctions' as Declaration of War, DPRK Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 13 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
DPRK Foreign Ministry issued the following statement today: 
  The Secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] recently committed an act of gravely encroaching upon the 
dignity and sovereignty of our Republic by following the United 
States' policy of stifling the DPRK. 
  The Board of Governors' meeting of the IAEA on June 10 
demanded opening of our military sites on the pretext of the 
nuclear issue and adopted an extremely unreasonable "resolution" 
on the "suspension of the agency's assistance" to our country. 
  This is obviously the agency's "sanctions" against us and, 
in 
essence, a prelude to UN "sanctions". 
  With the adoption of the "resolution" the plot of the United 
States and some quarters of the agency's Secretariat to isolate 
and stifle our Republic on the pretext of "a solution to the 
nuclear issue" has at last entered into a reckless stage of 
practice. 
  As is known, we have made every possible well-intentioned 
effort to prove the transparency of our nuclear activities even 
in our unique status. 
  However, as we have accepted more inspections by the agency, 
pressure on us has increased and things have got all the more 
complicated, and the security and sovereignty of our Republic 
now are exposed to threat hourly. 
  Some quarters of the agency's Secretariat have escalated 
their moves to stifle our Republic, ignoring all our good 
intentions and leniency, and finally brought the situation to 
such an extent where they took "sanctions" this time. 
  In this the United States and the IAEA Secretariat openly 
revealed their attempt to encroach upon our sovereignty and 
stifle us by using the leverage of inspection. 
  The conclusion at which we have arrived today when some 
quarters of the agency's Secretariat have chosen an undisguised 
exercise of strong arm is that pressure on us increases and our 
peaceful nuclear activities hit a bigger snag while we are bound 
to the unfair framework of the agency. 
  Ours is not the sort of people who reconcile themselves to 
humiliation even with their national sovereignty and dignity 
violated. 
  That the Secretariat of the agency tried to impose its total 
inspection on us by threatening us with "sanctions" is an 
intolerable insult to our people who regard independence as what 
keeps them alive. 
  When pressure and "sanctions" are imposed on us, our will 
grows stronger and our peaceful nuclear activities become all 
the more free. 
  In face of the folly of the IAEA which has taken 
unreasonable 
"sanctions" against us and, moreover, is attempting to intrude 
even into our military sites, the DPRK Foreign Ministry has been 
authorized to declare as follows: 
  Firstly, we will immediately withdraw from the IAEA. 
  We will consider invalid all the unreasonable "resolutions" 
adopted by the agency with regard to our issue up until now and 
will not be bound to any rules or resolutions of the agency 
hereafter. 
  Without the agency we can develop our independent nuclear 
power industry and expand international cooperation in the realm 
of nuclear activities. 
  Secondly, we declare that the inspections for the continuity 
of safeguards which we have accepted in our unique status will 
no longer be allowed. 
  Any unreasonable inspection can never be allowed till it has 
been decided whether we return to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty or completely withdraw from it. 
  Hence, the agency's inspectors now will have nothing to do 
any further in our country. 
  Thirdly, we strongly reaffirm our position that UN 
"sanctions" will be regarded immediately as a declaration of war. 
  "Sanctions" and dialogue are incompatible. It is our 
inevitable option to counter expanded "sanctions" by hostile 
forces with expanded self-defence measures. 
  This stand of ours will never change until our nuclear issue 
has been solved fairly through dialogue and negotiation. 
  We will keenly watch the development of the situation in the 
days ahead.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "A Bellicose Outburst Aimed </F>
at Crushing the Fellow Countrymen"] 
  [Text] According to a radio report from Seoul, the puppet 
Kim Yong-sam clique chaired a so-called National Security 
Council meeting on 8 June. He made bellicose and absurd remarks 
at the meeting under the pretext of our so-called nuclear issue 
that strong steps should be taken to resolve the nuclear issue 
through UN sanctions, and that there is no other alternative but 
sanctions to resolve the issue. This shows that the South 
Korean puppets are pursuing what is called multinational 
sanctions against us with the backing of outside forces. 
Therefore, their acts are antinational criminal acts that can 
never be forgiven. 
  Furthermore, the puppet clique is crying about the 
inevitability of sanctions against the same fellow countrymen at 
a time when the UN Security Council has recently issued an 
extravagant presidential statement against us and the United 
States and its followers have openly plotted to impose sanctions 
on us, thus making an issue of our Republic's peaceful use of 
nuclear energy. We cannot repress our rising indignation 
regarding this. 
  As has already been reported, the U.S. warmongers have 
recently run amok with a commotion of military pressure against 
us, while openly babbling, under the pretext of our nuclear 
issue, that a preemptive strike [sonje konggyok] against North 
Korea remains an option. 
  The U.S. imperialists have put their troops occupying South 
Korea on a 24-hour alert against us and, at the same time, have 
deployed the large aircraft carrier Independence to waters where 
it can participate within a few days in a operation of a 
northward invasion. Also, they have continued their warmanics 
by saying that they will change the location of the Rimpac war 
exercise to the waters off the East Sea of Korea. 
  Several days ago, the U.S. imperialist aggressive forces 
occupying South Korea even conducted a so-called noncombatant 
evacuation operation in Pusan, which entails preparing select 
U.S. soldiers and their dependents for a quick departure from 
South Korea if an emergency situation occurs on the Korean 
peninsula. Such an act by the U.S. imperialists shows that 
they, by setting a northward invasion war as their goal, are 
more viciously sticking to commotions to crush [apsal] us. 
  At this juncture, the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique is loudly 
babbling about so-called sanctions, playing into the hands of 
the U.S. imperialists, their masters. This clearly shows that 
the South Korean puppets -- who are thoroughly colonial servants 
-- as well as the antinational groups -- who are madly playing 
for the sake of the interests of outside forces -- are not 
considering the destiny of the nation. 
  Actually, the South Korean puppets are running amok with war 
preparations to provoke a northward invasion war as demanded by 
their masters, the U.S. imperialists. Also, they are madly 
carrying out their fascist-oriented suppression -- which is 
their usual way [sangnye] to provoke the northward invasion war 
-- upon the reunification and democratic forces. 
  They have inspired a war atmosphere by placing the puppet 
army on around-the-clock alert posture and, also, have attempted 
to suppress and exterminate the South Korean people's spirit for 
the anti-U.S., antigovernment, and antipuppet struggle, thus 
placing the police throughout South Korea under emergency duty 
orders and kicking up a commotion of check and search. The 
events now taking place in South Korea can only be seen as the 
eve of a war. These also vividly prove the South Korean 
puppets' attempt to push, without fail, our nation into the 
disaster of a nuclear war. 
  The Kim Yong-sam groups, who commit criminal acts against 
the 
nation, should be sternly punished by the nation. We have urged 
the Kim Yong-sam group to immediately stop committing the 
criminal act of making the land of our fatherland become the 
place of outside forces' nuclear war, thus warning it as much as 
it can accept [padadulrilmankum kyonggo hamyoso] that the 
so-called sanctions, which the imperialists plan to impose under 
the pretext of the suspicion of our nonexistent nuclear 
development, mean a war, and that there is no charity [chabi] in 
war. The Kim Yong-sam group, however, held the National 
Security Council meeting by ignoring our warning and have 
brought about the black cloud of nuclear war, thus more loudly 
babbling about the sanctions. 
  The Kim Yong-sam ring, treacherous group, who regards the 
interests of outside forces as more important than a warning 
from the same fellow countrymen, can never be safe. If the Kim 
Yong-sam ring wants to achieve their dirty political goal by 
carrying out sanctions in collusion with outside forces against 
the fellow countrymen, thus not considering the interests of the 
nation, it will be a big miscalculation. The Kim Yong-sam ring 
should be clearly aware that if they embark upon the road of 
adventure, their civil government will come to an end.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 13 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam in "a telephone dialogue" with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton on June 10 cried that "sanctions against the North must 
be promoted continuously" and, on the previous day, in "a

he said "U.N. sanctions against the North are inevitable," a 
Seoul-based radio report said. 
  On June 11, puppet Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku and 
puppet 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu met U.S. State Undersecretary 
Tarnoff in Seoul and prattled that U.N. Security Council's 
sanctions against the North are inevitable". 
  This tongue-wagging of the South Korean puppet clique is a 
never-to-be condoned criminal act to leave fellow countrymen 
victims of outside forces by realizing "sanctions against North" 
through the United Nations" by all means by entreating the U.S. 
and Japanese masters. 
  We solemnly warned the Kim Yong-sam group that "sanctions" 
against our Republic is immediately a war and a war is merciless. 
  This notwithstanding, the Kim Yong-sam traitor clique are 
making desperate efforts to get "sanctions" taken against the 
North with the help of foreign forces. This is a dangerous 
criminal act which may bring an unpredictable grave situation to 
the Korean peninsula. 
  The outcries of the Kim Yong-sam group over "sanctions" will 
precipitate their own destruction. 
  The South Korean puppet clique must act with discretion, 
clearly mindful of the tragic end.

  [Text] These days, the South Korean puppet clique are all 
the more running amok in the maneuvers to take sanctions on our 
Republic by ganging up with international reactionary forces, 
such as the United States and Japan. 
  According to a radio report from Seoul, traitor Kim Yong-sam 
had a telephone dialogue with U.S. President Clinton on 10 June 
and babbled that sanctions against North must be promoted 
continuously, and in a telephone dialogue with Japanese Prime 
Minister Hata on 9 June, he said that sanctions by the United 
Nations against the North is inevitable. 
  On 11 June, the puppet National Unification Board Minister 
Yi 
Hong-ku and the puppet Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu separately 
met U.S. Undersecretary of State Tarnoff who flew into Seoul and 
babbled that the UN Security Council's sanctions against the 
North are inevitable and so on. 
  Han Sung-chu also held talks with Japanese Foreign Minister 
Kakizawa who crawled into South Korea on 11 June and said that 
the current situation on the North's nuclear issue makes it 
inevitable to make the UN Security Council promote sanctions. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique are never-to-be condoned 
nation sellers entrusting the nation's fate to the outside 
forces through their acts, and all the more clearly showed that 
it is a civilian fascist group pursuing only war by wearing the 
mask of civilian rule.

<F P=106> ["United States Must Clearly Know the Will of the Korean </F>
People" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 12 (KCNA) -- The U.S. House of 
Representatives reportedly passed on Thursday a "resolution" 
urging "sanctions" against the DPRK. 
  This is entirely unreasonable. This is a wanton violation of 
the sovereignty and dignity of our Republic and an unpardonable 
strong-arm act to stifle our socialism. 
  The U.S. House of Representatives also carried a 
"resolution" 
urging the readjustment of the schedule of the "Team Spirit" 
joint military manoeuvres this year and "strengthening of the 
combat power" of the South Korean puppet army. This revealed 
again the sinister intention of the United States to contain the 
DPRK by force of arms. 
  This can be easily judged from the facts that Robert 
Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of state, blared that "the 
United States does not rule out military sanctions against North 
Korea" in a hearing at the subcommittee of Asian and Pacific 
affairs of the U.S. House of Representatives on the 9th of June 
and Hamilton, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the 
U.S. House of Representatives, next day said the U.S. had no 
other option but to fight and that it was necessary to increase 
the potentials of the U.S. troops in South Korea and the puppet 
armed forces. 
  If the United States chooses a reckless adventure, ignoring 
our repeated warnings, we will take a decisive self-defensive 
measure. 
  The United States must clearly see our unshakable will and 
resolution and immediately stop the adventurous war provocation 
moves.

  [Text] One year has passed since our country and the United 
States announced their joint statement confirming the 
prohibition of using armed forces -- including nuclear weapons 
-- or posing a threat by them; the mutual respect for their 
sovereignty; and the nonintervention into each other's internal 
affairs. 
  Over this period, the United States has not kept, even a 
little, the principles of the joint statement. Instead, it has 
been the subject of ridicule and denouncement by the people 
throughout the world because of their intentional aggravation of 
tensions on the Korean peninsula. 
  Up to date since the DPRK-U.S. joint statement was issued, 
approximately 150 countries throughout the world and a great 
many international and regional organizations have held rallies 
and demonstrations to urge the United States to sincerely 
implement the principles agreed upon by the two sides of the 
DPRK and the United States. Also, they have severely denounced 
the treacherous act of the United States by releasing 
statements, press statements, and articles.

  As has already been reported in its Foreign Ministry's 
statement on 28 April, the DPRK Government proposed to the U.S. 
side to hold negotiations on establishing a new peace 
arrangement that can prevent arms buildup and the recurrence of 
war on the Korean peninsula and practically guarantee solid 
peace. As a practical step for its realization, it has newly 
established a KPA mission in Panmunjom by recalling all members 
of our side from the Military Armistice Commission [MAC], which 
has failed to play its role in stabilizing the situation, as 
well as preventing arms buildup on the Korean peninsula. 
  Such a step by our side is a realistic and timely one taken 
to tide over the present situation in which the Korean Armistice 
Agreement had been a mere scrap of paper and the MAC remained in 
name only due to the unreasonable behavior of the U.S. side. 
  The U.S. side is aware of our such step. Even it has once 
expressed the position that it would make contacts with members 
of the KPA Panmunjom mission. 
  Nevertheless, the U.S. side on 6 June suddenly made a 
proposal to hold a meeting of senior secretaries of the MAC, 
which no longer exists. Regarding this, our side, reminding the 
U.S. side of the fact that all the members of our side had been 
recalled from the MAC, notified that an official of the KPA 
Panmunjom mission might meet with the side of the U.S. Forces 
[migunchuk]. 
  Then, the U.S. side showed up at the conference room alone 
and read a prearranged text and committed an act of issuing a 
so-called statement indicating that our side's act was a 
violation of the Armistice Agreement. Such an act by the U.S. 
side was nothing but a ridiculous drama aimed at evading its 
responsibility for destroying and systematically obliterating 
the Armistice Agreement and the armistice organization. 
  In fact, the U.S. side, at this time, is neither qualified 
nor has the face to talk about the violation of the Armistice 
Agreement. 
  It is the U.S. side that in June 1956 forcibly expelled the 
neutral nations inspection teams which had been supervising and 
controlling the introduction [panip] and removal [panchul] of 
military equipment by staying at appropriate entry ports of 
South Korea in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 3, of the 
Korean Armistice Agreement. It is also the U.S. side that 
unilaterally proclaimed in June 1957 that it would renounce the 
implementation of Subparagraph D of Paragraph 13 of the Korean 
Armistice Agreement that stipulates the cessation of the 
introduction of combat equipment into Korea. 
  It is the U.S. side that not only completely paralyzed the 
armistice organization by appointing a general of the South 
Korean Army, who has neither legal justification nor 
qualification, as the senior member of its side, but also is now 
beefing up the armed forces in South Korea. 
  It is preposterous for the U.S. side, which had unilaterally 
wrecked the major articles of the Armistice Agreement and the 
armistice organization, to talk about an agreement between the 
two sides. 
  What are the MAC and the Neutral Nations Supervisory 
Commission, which can no longer prevent arms buildup or the 
recurrence of war because of the U.S. side's plot, needed for. 
  Whether or nor it accepts our new proposal will be a 
touchstone determining the fundamental question of war or peace 
[uriui saeroun cheanul chopsuhanunga anhanunga hanun kossun 
chonjaenginya pyonghwanya hanun kunbonmunjelul karunun 
sigumsoguro toenda]. 
  It will be a wise behavior of the U.S. side to embark upon 
the road of establishing a new peace arrangement that can 
prevent the danger of war and definitely guarantee peace and 
security, instead of trying to revive the armistice 
organization, the function of which has been completely 
paralyzed by it. 
  We will watch the future actions of the U.S. side.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 12 (KCNA) -- The United States is 
now clamouring for "military attack" and "forestalling strike" 
upon the nuclear facilities of the DPRK, Japan declared that it 
would join the United States in its measure for sanction against 
Korea and some officials of the Secretariat of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] are insisting on the inspection of 
two military objects. The anti-DPRK pressure campaign is being 
escalated by the United States and its followers over the 
nuclear issue in a bid to internationalize and politicize the 
"nuclear issue" of the DPRK to put "pressure" and isolate and 
stifle the DPRK socialism, says NODONG SINMUN in a signed 
commentary today. 
  Never should it go unnoticed that the anti-DPRK moves of the 
United States and its followers are all the more undisguised, 
timing to coincide with the replacement of fuel rods in the 
DPRK, the commentary notes, and goes on: 
  Fuel rods are being replaced, preserving the technical 
possibility to make ad hoc inspection of the fuel rods at a time 
when our unique status is removed. 
  We have done all we can in relation with the IAEA and the 
United States to settle the nuclear issue of the Korean 
peninsula. We could no longer overlook the anti-DPRK moves of 
the United States and its followers. Therefore, we solemnly 
made clear our stand of principle toward them. 
  Herein lies the meaning that if the United States takes the 
road of strong-arm policy, our road to go would be changed and 
we would be left with no other choice but to go over to the 
continuous process of the peaceful nuclear activities. 
  This is neither an empty talk nor a threat. We have not told 
an empty talk but practised what we once decided. 
  We are now carrying into practice our declaration that we 
cannot stop the peaceful nuclear activities, even sustaining a 
great economic loss and posing a great danger to technical 
security. We did if we intended. 
  If the United States and its followers continue to resort to 
the pressure row against the DPRK, ignoring our warnings, we 
would have no other choice but to put into practice our stand. 
The United States and the IAEA will be to blame for any 
consequence. 
  The United States and its followers should not suspect the 
will of our people.

  The Patriot missiles opened that day belong to a unit of the

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 13 (KCNA) -- The command of the U.S. 
Forces occupying South Korea staged an "operation demonstration" 
of a Patriot missile battery and the U.S. aircraft carriers 
participating in the Rimpac joint manoeuvres will soon head for 
the waters of the Korean peninsula. Commenting on this, NODONG 
SINMUN today says the moves will drive the situation on the 
Korean peninsula to the extreme pitch of strain. This indicates 
that the United States intends to escalate threat to the DPRK 
and, furthermore, commit a military adventure, the analyst says, 
and continues: 
  In staging the Rimpac manoeuvres with our Republic as the 
target of attack, the United States pursues the criminal scheme 
to facilitate the combat actions of the "multinational forces" 
against the DPRK in "case of emergency" on the Korean peninsula. 
  It is intensifying the reactionary offensive to stifle our 
Republic with strength under the pretext of "nuclear suspicion 
against the North" and even openly crying for "a preemptive 
strike" at it. 
  It is as clear as noonday that the U.S. imperialists and the 
South Korean puppets have taken the criminal road of carrying 
into practice the already worked out "New Operation Plan 5027", 
a war scenario against the North. 
  We are following with heightened vigilance the reckless 
moves 
of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets to 
unleash a nuclear war against our Republic at any cost. 
  War is by no means what we want. 
  If the South Korean puppets think they will get scot-free 
after provoking a nuclear war against fellow countrymen, in 
league with foreign forces, it is the height of folly.

Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam called a press conference in 
Berlin on June 10 and clarified the principled position of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea concerning the nuclear

solution to the issue. 
  Answering questions put by reporters, he said: 
  "The great leader President Kim Il-song made it clear more 
than once long ago that our country has neither intention nor 
capacity to manufacture nuclear weapons. 
  "What do we need such weapons for? The 'nuclear issue' of 
our country was raised because the United States has been 
suspicious of our peaceful nuclear activities from the beginning. 
  "As our country has foundations of the independent national 
economy and a powerful defence capacity, any 'sanctions' can 
never frighten us," he declared, and said: 
  "We demand that the United States respond to talks for a 
peaceful solution to the issue with due attention. It would be 
well advised to be clearly mindful that if it failed to respond 
to the talks, trying to resolve the issue with pressure and 
'sanctions', it will result only in causing tension on the 
Korean peninsula." 
  Kim Yong-nam declared that the Korean people will achieve 
national reunification independently in accordance with the 
three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and 
great national unity."

a news conference in Berlin, Germany, on 10 June. Reporters of 
foreign newspapers, news agencies, and radio in Germany attended 
the news conference. The foreign minister, who spoke at the 
news conference, talked about our principled position on the 
nuclear issue -- including the essence of the nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula, the replacement of fuel rods, and the 
method of resolving the nuclear issue -- and answered reporters' 
questions by saying: Over the past few years, the great leader 
Comarde Kim Il-song has already declared on many occasions that 
our country has no intention nor capacity to produce nuclear 
weapons. If we have them, where can we use them! The nuclear 
issue of our country has been raised because the United States 
has dealt with us from the beginning with its doubts on our 
peaceful nuclear activity. 
  He stressed that because our country has a foundation of 
self- reliant national economy and a powerful defensive 
capability, no sanction steps can frighten us, and he continued: 
We demand that the United States respond to talks with its 
interest to peacefully resolve the issue. The United States 
should clearly know that if it does not come to the talks, but 
rather tries to resolve the issue with its pressure or 
sanctions, it will only aggravate tensions on the Korean 
peninsula.

<F P=106> ["Repressive Offensive Against Anti-war Forces" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 12 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam 
fascist clique recently issued an order to the puppet police 
throughout South Korea to hurriedly arrest some 90 leading 
members of the South Korean Federation of General Student 
Councils (Hanchongnyon) including its chairman, alleging that 
"the disposition of Hanchongnyon benefiting the enemy was made 
clear." 
  In this regard, NODONG SINMUN today says this reckless 
repressive row kicked up by the Kim Yong-sam group is a 
premeditated fascist offensive to suppress and stifle 
Hanchongnyon, the vanguard of the anti-war, anti-nuke struggle 
for independence, democracy and reunification, and students. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The repressive offensive against Hanchongnyon was launched 
at 
a time when the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique was driving the 
situation to the worst phase, letting loose such bellicose 
utterances as "tough counteraction," "retaliatory punishment" 
and "sanctions" under the pretext of our "nuclear issue." 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique are now serving the 
imperialists as a "shockbrigade" in their moves to take 
"sanctions" against us over the "nuclear suspicion." They are 
also getting overheated in arms buildup and nuclear war 
exercises in a bid to fulfil "the new operation plan 5027" they 
worked out with outside forces to invade the North. 
  The reality shows that the Kim Yong-sam group is going to 
make a military adventure against us in league with its master, 
the United States. 
  The South Korean puppets intend to suppress the pro- 
reunification, patriotic and democratic forces of South Korea 
including Hanchongnyon that they consider to be an obstacle to 
their criminal moves, thus stamping out the anti-U.S., anti-war, 
anti- nuke, anti-"government" forces at a stroke in South Korea. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group must be mindful that the further it 
is 
hell bent on the suppression of the people and war provocation 
moves, the earlier the day of its disgraceful destruction will 
come.

<F P=106> ["DPRK FM Spokesman Refutes Reports About 'Arms Deal </F>
Contract' With Southern Yemen" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
today answered a question put by KCNA on the reports about an 
"arms deal contract" allegedly signed by the DPRK with the 
Southern Yemen forces. 
  He said: 
  Some foreign news media are now spreading reports that the 
DPRK signed an "arms deal a "new contract" with the Southern 
Yemen forces, according to which it will supply Aden with jet 
planes, tanks, tactical missiles and other combat equipment. 
  This is an utterly groundless fabrication. 
  It is by no means accidental that such reports are afloat 
when the manoeuvres to stifle the DPRK over the fictitious 
"nuclear issue" have reached a grave stage. 
  We cannot but think that they are underlain by the political 
intention to impair the authority of the DPRK and isolate it in 
the international arena. 
  Our country which has steadfastly maintained the principle 
of 
non-interference in relations with other countries consistently 
calls for a negotiated solution of disputes between the parties 
concerned. 
  The dispute between the Northern and Southern Yemen is 
merely 
an internal dispute, and it is inconceivable for us to "help" 
any one side. 
  From the very moment the dispute broke out between the North 
and the South of Yemen we have hoped to see it solved peacefully 
at an early date in the interests of the entire Yemeni people 
without outside interference, and there is no change in this 
principled stand of ours now. 
  Truth will be made clear. 
  No insidious attempt can tarnish the image of our dignified 
Republic or damage the excellent relations between our country 
and Yemen.

<F P=106> ["Self-Defensive Right Cannot Be Encroached Upon" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 13 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Chinese Foreign Ministry declared in connection with an 
underground nuclear testing on June 10 that China always stands 
for complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear 
weapons and, within this context, the realization of a 
comprehensive nuclear test ban, and said China fully respects 
and understands the position and concern of many non-nuclear 
weapon states on the question of nuclear testing. 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says it is the 
United 
States which tops the world's list in nuclear testing and 
stockpile of nuclear weapons and it is again the U.S. which has 
deployed them in all parts of the world and interferes in 
others' internal affairs, threatening them with those weapons. 
  The analyst goes on: 
  The United States has carried out over 1,000 times of 
nuclear 
tests for the development and modernisation of nuclear weapons 
since the 1940s. It decided to allocate 11.7 billion dollars to 
the production of nuclear warheads of new types in fiscal 1995. 
  It wantonly interferes in the internal affairs of other 
countries on the pretext of "non-proliferation of nuclear 
weapons" and recently worked out even a "nuclear 
non-proliferation strategy". The "strategy" is intended to 
counter "proliferation of nuclear weapons" even by using such 
kinds of weapons. 
  Such being the situation, nuclear states which have 
relatively few nuclear weapons, to say nothing of non-nuclear 
states, cannot but stand against the nuclear threat of the 
United States and seek a self-defensive measure. The 
underground nuclear testing of China this time can be considered 
in this context. 
  A self-defensive measure stands out as a more urgent matter 
for Korea. The U.S. hardline conservative forces are increasing 
military threat as never before, pursuing "sanctions" against 
the DPRK. International reactionaries and some countries are 
doing base acts, dancing to the tune of the U.S. this proves 
that the United States and its followers are trying to isolate 
and stifle Korean socialism at any cost over the nuclear issue. 
  We have done and are doing everything we can to solve the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. But the moves for 
stifling us are assuming growing intensity. Under this 
condition, we cannot but take a tough action as has been 
decided. We have the right to take a self-defensive measure. 
  The United States and its followers must know that this is 
not an empty word.

<F P=106> ["Letter of Appeal" to members of the Korean Children's </F>
Union, KCU, adopted at the fifth congress of the KCU on 7 
June--read by unidentified speaker] 
  [Text] KCU [Korean Children's Union], members throughout 
the country: The fifth congress of the KCU was splendidly held 
in Pyongyang, the capital of the revolution, amid the warm love 
and care of the great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song and the 
respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il. [applause] 
  The fifth congress of the KCU, a significant congress of KCU 
members who are advancing toward a bright and hopeful future, 
flying their proud red-color neckties, was a congress of glory, 
a congress of loyalty, which showed the appearance of three 
million KCU members who are growing up rapidly as the flower bud 
of the revolution amid the bosom of the party and which 
demonstrated to the world the firm will of the successors to the 
chuche revolutionary cause to continue to the end the march road 
of Paektu following the respected and beloved General Kim 
Chong-il. [applause] 
  The great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song, who identifies 
children as the kings of the country, sent a congratulatory 
message of love to the participants of the congress. The great 
leader's congratulatory message is not only a brilliant sunlight 
which brightens the future road of KCU members, who are always 
preparing themselves for the consummation of the chuche 
revolutionary cause under the party's leadership, but is also 
the great program for the chuche-oriented children's movement. 
  Receiving the great leader's congratulatory message, KCU 
members throughout the country are filled with infinite emotion 
and joy. 
  The great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song, who opened the 
glorious beginning of the communist children's movement of our 
country and formed the children's union and who has, thus, 
identified our children as the kings of the country! The 
respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il, who is fostering 
strong our KCU members, the flower buds of the country, as 
reliable successors to the chuche revolutionary cause, upholding 
the generalissimo's lofty intent! Thanks to the guiding hands of 
the great generalissimo and the respected and beloved general 
the wide (?flower garden) of the 11-year compulsory education 
system has opened, the palace of love has been erected high, and 
the garden of happiness is efflorescing. 
  We are the proud KCU members who are growing up strong 
without envy in the world amid the kind bosom of directing deep 
attention to children and even picking stars in the sky for 
children while saying the revolution and construction are 
carried out only for the next generations. 
  We, the happy children who were born with the good fortune 
of 
upholding the leader [suryong] and with the good fortune of 
being blessed with his love! We are proud of the fifth congress 
of the KCU, a historic congress that fully demonstrated to the 
world our mind of loyalty and filial piety toward our great 
generalissimo and respected and beloved general. [applause] 
  The whole course of the congress seethed with KCU members' 
invariable faith and zeal of loyalty to carry on the chuche 
revolutionary cause and to consummate it to the end upholding 
the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il. Let us become 
true young vanguards of the Workers Party who are infinitely 
faithful to the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il. This 
was the basic spirit of the congress. It was also the solemn 
echo noticing the glorious [word indistinct] of our communist 
children's movement. 
  For our KCU members, who are continuing the chuche 
revolutionary cause generation after generation, there is no 
greater honor and pride than to become the party's young 
vanguards who are infinitely loyal to the respected and beloved 
General Kim Chong-il. [applause] 
  The fifth congress of the KCU sends this letter of appeal to 
KCU members across the country, firmly believing that all KCU 
members across the country will advance staunchly with one 
breath and one step, upholding the great leader Generalissimo 
Kim Il-song's congratulatory message and following the respected 
and beloved General Kim Chong-il. [applause] 
  All the members of the KCU! Today, the members of our KCU 
who walked a proud road by upholding the slogan "Let us always 
be prepared for each stage of our revolution which is filled 
with glory," have upheld the banner of loyalty to firmly prepare 
themselves for their leader [yongdoja]. This is truly an 
exciting event. 
  Let us highly manifest to the whole world the resolute will 
and firm faith of the members of our KCU who are trying to 
always be prepared for the respected and beloved General Kim 
Chong-il. Members of the KCU, let us highly uphold the slogan, 
"Let us always be prepared for the respected and beloved General 
Kim Chong-il," and be true young vanguards of the Workers Party 
endlessly loyal to the general. 
  The true young vanguards of the party, this is a truly 
glorious title that makes all of our hearts beat. Becoming a 
true young vanguard of the party is to become a young 
revolutionary resolutely advocating and safeguarding the general 
and fighting for the general by sacrificing his life with the 
firm faith to follow only the respected and beloved General Kim 
Chong-il from the time he is young. 
  The members of the KCU must be true young vanguards of the 
party so that they can become reliable youth vanguards of the 
party in the future and thus become a glorious member of the 
Workers Party and grow up to be the party's true loyalists and 
dutiful sons. 
  The basic character which the members of the young vanguards 
of the party must possess is pure loyalty, having faith in, and 
following only the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il. 
  The great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song has taught: The 
members of the KCU must have a high pride of the fact that our 
party is the best and that the bosom of our party is the best, 
and always have faith in and follow our party, and study and 
live as taught by the party. 
  From the time when they were young, the members of the KCU 
must know only of their leader and their party, and must loyally 
follow only the party and the leader. 
  On the road of loyally following the respected and beloved 
General Kim Chong-il by highly upholding the great leader 
Generalissimo Kim Il-song lies the true life of the members of 
the KCU and a magnificent future. 
  All the members of the KCU, let us become loyal and dutiful 
sons of having faith in and following only the respected and 
beloved General Kim Chong-il. The respected and beloved General 
Kim Chong-il is the fate of our people and the members of the 
KCU. There can be no delight, laughter, and happiness of the 
members of our KCU apart from the general's bosom. 
  The minds of the members of the KCU who have faith in and 
who 
are following the respected and beloved general must be 
spotlessly clean. When the members of our KCU were born, the 
first thing they saw was the benevolent pictures of the great 
generalissimo and the respected and beloved general, and the 
first words they learned was, "Thank you Generalissimo Kim 
Il-song and thank you Mr. Kim Chong- il." 
  With the pure mind of that time, let us all become 
sunflowers 
of loyalty having faith in and following the respected and 
beloved General Kim Chong-il. Just like the pine tree that does 
not lose its appearance even if it is buried in snow, let us 
foster the members of the KCU to have high loyalty who are able 
to plow through thousand-ri of sea of fire and jumping over 
myriads of mountains if it is for an eternally unchangeable 
loyalty and for the great general. 
  Members of the KCU, let us all the more vigorously carry out 
the movement of learning the glorious youth era of the great 
leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song and the respected and beloved 
General Kim Chong-il to regard the generalissimo's and the 
general's lofty example as a basis and put it into practice 
every step of the way. [applause] 
  Let us all take active part in the loyal exploration march 
toward Chongil peak, the march to find the old home of the Mt. 
Paektu secret camp, and the exploration march of Mt. Changja to 
deeply bear in their minds the high intention of the respected 
and beloved general who fostered the far-reaching plan to 
elucidate Korea. 
  All the members of the KCU, let us firmly prepare ourselves 
to become reliable successors of the chuche revolutionary cause 
who possesses our party's revolutionary ideology and socialist 
and communist ideology. 
  The members of the KCU who are the next shift of the 
revolution are young revolutionaries. The members of the KCU 
must be firmly armed with our party's revolutionary ideology and 
socialist and communist ideology from the time when they are 
young so that they can become a chuche-oriented revolutionary 
and a true young vanguard of the party. 
  Members of the KCU: Let us firmly arm ourselves with our 
party's revolutionary ideology and the chuche idea. The chuche 
idea is a political nutrient for the members of the KCU and a 
compass indicating the road ahead of the revolution. 
  Let us all deeply study the works of the great leader and 
the 
respected and beloved general, the [word indistinct] of the 
chuche idea, to make the deep meaning filled in the works become 
our bones and flesh, and let us always think and act only 
according to the demand of the chuche idea anytime and anywhere. 
  The members of KCU must firmly succeed the existence of our 
revolution so that it will be possible to complete to the end 
the chuche revolutionary cause. The blood relationship linking 
the revolution generation after generation is our party's 
revolutionary tradition. 
  Members of the KCU; let us firmly arm ourselves with our 
party's brilliant revolutionary tradition. Let us substantially 
carry out various traditional revolutionary studies such as the 
(?ideological) study of the participants of the anti-Japanese 
revolutionary struggle and study of slogans to brilliantly 
succeed the revolutionary spirit of the anti-Japanese 
revolutionary patriotic forefathers who plowed through the march 
road toward Mt. Paektu by highly upholding the great leader. 
  Let us all the more thoroughly embody the slogan, "Let us 
carry out study and live in accordance with the anti-Japanese 
KCU." The revolution which continues generation after 
generation is advanced through struggle opposing all kinds of 
class enemies. The dark intention of the class enemies does not 
change. 
  Members of the KCU, let us correctly know the aggressive and 
exploitative true nature of the class enemies including the U.S. 
imperialists, the inveterate enemy, which brought about 
innumerable unhappiness and sufferings to our people. 
  Let us always become a young revolutionary fighter endlessly 
hating the class enemies and fight resolutely opposing the 
rascals. The more happy we are let us all the more never forget 
even for a minute our people past days who were exploited and 
oppressed. Let us always be firmly prepared in our hearts to 
maintain happiness through struggle by singing the songs of 
happiness. 
  All the members of the KCU, let us become true young 
patriots 
devoting their bodies and minds to elucidate the chuche 
socialist fatherland. Our socialist fatherland is the nest of 
the life and happiness of the members of the KCU. 
  There can be no happiness today and a magnificent hope for 
the future of the members of the KCU, apart from the bosom of 
the socialist fatherland. The bosom of the socialist fatherland 
is the bosom of the great general [widaehan changjunnim]. 
[applause] 
  Members of the KCU, let us treasure the socialist fatherland 
more so than one's life with the one mind of loyalty of 
upholding the great general and live enthusiastically. Having a 
love for the country is fostered when we treasure even a single 
blade of grass and tree of the fatherland, and when loving the 
mountains and streams of their hometown, parents, and their 
teacher. 
  Let us all firmly foster patriotism to become true young 
patriots and young heroes unhesitatingly devoting their lives if 
it is for the party, the fatherland, and the people. 
  All the members of the KCU, our fatherland endlessly 
prospering under the wise leadership of the respected and 
beloved General Kim Chong-il is waiting for a brilliant future. 
The future is ours. Being possessed with knowledge, virtue, and 
a healthy body is an important struggle goal of the members of 
the KCU and a sacred task to bring about a brilliant future 
ahead of schedule. 
  Let us all the more widely unfold the wings of knowledge, 
virtue, and a healthy body for the respected and beloved general 
and for the fatherland. Studying well is the first duty of the 
members of the KCU. The members of the KCU must first and 
second study well. Let us all highly uphold the slogan, "Let us 
learn for Korea," and learn the glorious youth days of the 
respected and beloved general to demonstrate the pride of being 
a top honor student. 
  The respected and beloved general regarded the top honor 
students as a jewel and pride, and loved them most and put them 
in the forefront. Let us give happiness to the father and 
general by obtaining excellent grades. 
  Let us become energetic and devoted scholars concentrating 
on 
studying during the days of the KCU so that they will be able to 
become doctors, associate doctors, and famous inventors world 
wide in the twenties and thirties. 
  The members of the KCU must read many books during the KCU 
era which is filled with dreams. A book is a teacher without 
words and a traveling companion of learning. 
  Let us vigorously carry out the reading trip toward Mt. 
Changja study site to read more books and actively take part in 
the school excursions, (?the blazing ideological activities), 
and the (?2 June) camping to all the more consolidate 
extensively and deeply the knowledge that we have learned. 
  Like the new generation living in a civilized era, let us 
become members of the KCU who are developed in various fields 
such as reading poems, singing songs, writing, doing magic, and 
playing over one instrument. 
  Let us fully develop our makings and talents in the bosom 
of the party which grows the valuable buds of the budding 
flowers rapidly and become little doctors, little writers, and 
little artists. 
  Let us the KCU members have the beautiful communist morality 
and traits. The beautiful communist morality and traits of the 
KCU members are the bright face of our fatherland. We should 
foster the traits well in our KCU days so that we may become 
righteous people who are faithful, good-mannered, and add luster 
to man's dignity. The 10-point principles for the school 
children to observe in their moral lives set forth by the 
respected and beloved father General Kim Chong-il is the good 
textbook of morality education which the KCU members should 
always observe as they look in the mirror. 
  The members of the KCU: Let us abide by these 10-point 
principles thoroughly and have the true traits with which we 
think of the interests of the group first, love our comrades, 
and devote all we have to the interests of the group. 
  The strong physical health of the KCU members is the 
treasure 
of the country. The KCU members should maintain strong physical 
health so that the homes and society may be happy and gay with 
laughter and smiles and filled with romantic optimism. The KCU 
members should conduct various types of athletic activities 
briskly to temper their bodies and foster strong fighting 
spirit, bravery, and boldness. They should actively participate 
in various sports activities to acquire at least one sport skill 
and to actively contribute to the development of the country's 
development of sport skills. 
  Loving to carry out the revolution and to work is the proud 
ethos of the KCU members. It is truly a proud thing for them to 
become the propagators of the party policy, helpers in the 
implementation of the party policy, little builders of the 
country, and little housekeepers of the country as KCU members. 
Let us the KCU members continue to conduct the sociopolitical 
activities vigorously and in high spirits with the sound of the 
drums and bugles of the KCU, in order to keep the streets, 
towns, and work places brisk and to give the people joy and 
rapture. 
  Let us further develop our school-our guardpost campaign and 
prepare ourselves firmly in our mind to become the honorable 
sentries for the defense of the fatherland following the example 
of the brothers and sisters of the People's Army. Let us do 
more good deeds voluntarily for the country, the people, and the 
Army of the respected and beloved general. 
  The KCU members: Let us participate ourselves in the core of 
the KCU's organizational life and prepare ourselves firmly to be 
the true juvenile honor guard unit and dependable inheritors of 
the chuche revolutionary cause. The KCU's organizational life 
is the school for revolutionary indoctrination for the KCU 
members. In order for the KCU members to become good members of 
the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea [LSWYK] and to 
become members of the glorious WPK in the future, they should 
all carry on the KCU's organizational life well. KCU members: 
Let us treasure and love the KCU organization, entrust 
everything to the KCU organization, sincerely participate in the 
KCU life, learn the KCU rules and regulations, and live 
according to these rules and regulations at any time and place. 
  Through the life of the KCU, let us develop ourselves 
vigorously to become the party's true housekeepers with 
organization- mindedness, discipline-mindedness, diligence, and 
simple mind, and faithfully abide by the pledge made before the 
KCU flag. [crowd chants indistinct slogans] 
  In order to strengthen the KCU organization, we should make 
the branch unions, the basic organizational units of the KCU, 
function with vitality. All the branch unions should carry out 
their roles well so that the school children's unions are 
strengthened and the KCU is strengthened. The KCU activists, 
including the chairmen of the branch unions: Let us uphold the 
slogan of strengthening the branch unions and make all the 
branch unions strong branch unions. 
  Let us become the example of the KCU members in all 
areas--study, organizational life, and so on--and lead the 
branch unions vigorously. 
  The revolution's enemies, including the U.S. imperialists, 
are frenziedly maneuvering today to harm our-style socialism and 
to deprive our KCU members of their happiness. However, we have 
nothing to fear and we are brave because we uphold the respected 
and beloved General Kim Chong-il, the ever-victorious 
iron-willed brilliant commander, as the supreme commander. 
  The three million members of the KCU: Let us all become 
three million bombs and six million hand grenades that defend 
the respected and beloved general at the cost of our lives and 
defend our beloved socialist fatherland, following the example 
of our brothers and sisters of the LSWYK who are preparing 
themselves to be five million bombs to cope with the situation 
created. [applause] 
  All KCU members, let us all firmly renew our resolve, 
determination, and faith with awareness of the sacred mission 
for the times and the revolution as we embark on a new step 
forward with the Fifth Conference of the KCU as a turning point. 
  As long as we have the great leader Generalissimo Kim 
Il-song 
and the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il and as long 
as we have the world's best socialist system, the future of us 
the KCU members will always be filled with joy and happiness. 
[applause] 
  Let us all advance forward vigorously, following the 
respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il, to expedite the 
chuche revolutionary cause initiated by the great leader. 
[applause] 
  Long live the great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song! Long 
live the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il! 
  The Fifth Conference of the KCU, 7 June 1994. [applause]

<F P=106> [By Simon Sinaga in Jakarta] </F>
  [Text] Workers at a cigarette factory in north Sumatera, on 
strike since last Saturday for payment of overtime claims, 
yesterday released three foremen whom they had taken hostage 
briefly earlier in the day. 
  A company official who declined to be named said the nearly 
4,000 employees of the N.V. [expansion unknown] Sumatera Tobacco 
Trading company in the industrial town of Pematang Siantar, 120 
km south of Medan, had yet to return to work. 
  Manpower Ministry officials have been trying to mediate in 
the six-day dispute, which has been confined to the factory 
premises. Dozens of police and military personnel have been 
deployed in the area. 
  The situation at the factory remained tense yesterday 
evening, but the workers, who damaged some company offices and 
property on Wednesday, did not resort to any more violence, 
sources said. 
  It was not known why the employees held the three foremen 
hostage. Two were ethnic-Chinese Indonesians and the third came 
from Java. 
  The workers began their strike action last Saturday after 
their demands for payment of overtime claims were not met. 
  The head of the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation's Medan 
branch, Mr. Alamsyah, said that on Tuesday the entire workforce 
marched to the local police station to protest against the 
detention of one of their colleagues who had been among the most 
vocal during the strike. 
  No clashes occurred between workers and security forces, but 
on Wednesday workers damaged property on the factory premises. 
  A labour activist source said that although the Manpower 
Ministry was trying to mediate in the incident, the "workers 
appeared to have lost trust in the officials". 
  Workers in Medan and surrounding towns staged violent 
demonstrations in April, causing untold damage to factories, 
shops, houses and other property. One ethnic-Chinese 
businessman was killed. 
  The government this week began prosecuting over 80 people 
for 
their involvement in that protest, which workers had mounted to 
demand higher minimum wages and better working conditions. 
  Mr Alamsyah did not link the action at the Sumatera Tobacco 
Trading company with the earlier more widespread unrest. But he 
said some company employees were not even getting the officially 
sanctioned Rp [rupiah] 3,100 (S$2.21) [Singapore dollar] daily 
minimum wage.

<F P=106> [Speech by Nouhak Phoumsavan, president of the Lao People's </F>
Democratic Republic, delivered at the Vientiane banquet hosted 
on 9 June in honor of the visiting high-level delegation of the 
government of the Union of Myanmar headed by Than Shwe, chairman 
of the State Law and Order Restoration Council -- recorded] 
  [Text] Today, the Lao National Assembly, government, and 
people as well as my wife and I are highly honored and very 
pleased to welcome to our country Your Excellency the chairman 
of the State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] of the 
Union of Myanmar [Burma], your wife, and delegation. Your 
choice of our country as the first destination for your first 
visit abroad since your assumption of the SLORC chairmanship is 
regarded as a great honor to our republic. This visit is an 
event of great significance in the history of relations between 
our two countries. We highly value this visit and are confident 
that it will contribute not only to further strengthening our 
ties of friendship and cooperation, but also to building peace, 
stability, friendship, and cooperation among countries in this 
region. 
  Your Excellency the chairman, ladies and gentlemen, Laos and 
Myanmar are two neighboring countries sharing a common border. 
They also share a similar history, that is they were colonized 
by foreign powers. 
  The peoples of Laos and Myanmar have maintained friendly 
ties 
and brotherly affection since ancient times. We are both 
Buddhist followers who practice a similar culture, traditions, 
and customs and constantly make religious merit together. We 
also assist and support one another at all times. The Lao 
Government and people would like to express our sincere thanks 
to the government and people of Myanmar for donating rice and 
other relief aid when we encountered difficulties and shortages 
in recent years. At the same time, we are very proud of the 
incessant growth and development in our fine relations of 
friendship and cooperation. This is seen concretely in the 
exchange of visits by delegations at various levels, the mutual 
visits by our peoples, and the solution of various problems 
between our countries with a sense of sincerity and mutual 
understanding, for instance the speedy demarcation of the common 
border between Laos and Myanmar that recently concluded with 
great success within a short period of time. 
  We are very pleased to see that thanks to the persistent 
pursuance of its policy and the effective administration of the 
country by SLORC chaired by Your Excellency, the Union of 
Myanmar has become more stable every passing day. As a result, 
the socioeconomic development in your country has produced 
effective results. With rapid steps in socioeconomic 
development, the material and moral life of the people of 
Myanmar has now clearly improved. Myanmar's status and role in 
the international arena has also been consolidated and its 
cooperation with other countries broadened. I would to take 
this auspicious opportunity to wish the fraternal people of 
Myanmar new and greater achievements in defending your national 
independence, unity, and stability so that you will be able to 
build their country into a wealthy, strong, and prosperous 
entity. 
  Respected Your Excellency the chairman, ladies and 
gentlemen, 
in recent years, we the Lao people, have actively carried out 
national development and construction in accordance with our 
policy of comprehensive restructuring. We have made certain 
initial important achievements in this endeavor. Our country 
has now attained peace and stability. Our socioeconomic 
development has made continuous progress. Our country's 
potential in various fields have been comprehensively exploited. 
With the consolidated use of our inner strength and in 
coordination with the [words indistinct] foreign investment and 
international assistance and cooperation, the material and 
cultural life of our multiethnic people has been gradually 
upgraded. Nonetheless, we have not yet been freed from under 
development. Therefore, the Lao Government and people regard 
national construction and development as our important tasks 
aimed at improving the well-being of our people and making our 
country prosperous. 
  To achieve the aforementioned esteemed goals, in addition to 
mobilizing every consolidated potential of our nation, we also 
regard the creation of favorable external conditions as an 
important issue. That is why the LPDR has pursued the foreign 
policy of peace, independence, (?friendship), and cooperation 
with all countries regardless of the differences in our 
political systems and on the basis of the five-point principle 
of peaceful coexistence. We continue to consistently pursue the 
policy of building good relations and promoting cooperation for 
mutual benefit with neighboring countries, thereby contributing 
to enhancing peace, stability, friendship, and cooperation for 
development in this region. 
  As for the Union of Myanmar, we can see our two countries 
possess many similar potential and special characteristics. The 
two sides should consult and exchange views to look for better 
and more effective forms and methods of cooperation at various 
levels. We hope that the visit by Your Excellency the chairman 
and your wife and delegation will open a new era for 
strengthening, deepening, and broadening the relations and 
cooperation between our two countries, thus making the 
friendship and brotherly affection between the peoples of Laos 
and Myanmar (?grow even stronger). 
  In this atmosphere of intimacy and warmth, I invite all 
distinguished personalities, ladies and gentlemen to toast with 
me to the lasting friendship and increasingly fruitful 
cooperation between the LPDR and the Union of Myanmar, to the 
health of His Excellency General Than Shwe and his wife, to the 
health of all delegates from the Union of Myanmar, and to the 
health of all ladies and gentlemen attending this banquet. 
  Thank you.

  [Text] Manila, June 13 (AFP) -- The Philippine Government 
has authorized an affiliate of the US firm Vaalco Energy Inc. to 
conduct preliminary oil drilling research in the disputed 
Spratly Islands, the Department of Energy said Monday. 
  The six-month permit allows Alcorn (Production) Philippines 
Inc. to conduct "research and library work" on aeromagnetic 
surveys and other data already held by the department, its oil 
and gas division chief, Ismael Ocampo, said. 
  The permit covers the Kalayaan group of eight islands and 
reefs currently garrisoned by Philippine troops. 
  Ocampo told AFP the permit, the first to be granted by 
Manila 
in the area, was "sensitive" due to conflicting territorial 
claims on the strategic South China Sea chain by Brunei, China, 
Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. 
  Because of the territorial conflict, any eventual drilling 
to 
be permitted by Manila would have to be in a "joint venture with 
China and Vietnam," he said, adding that no other Philippine oil 
exploration firm has applied for permit in the Kalayaan area. 
  An Alcorn official, Ponciano Mathay, told AFP his company 
has 
applied for a permit to conduct research on the Kalayaan area, 
but insisted the energy department had yet to approve it. 
  He said the permit would not require Alcorn to conduct 
actual 
drilling. 
  Two US firms, Crestone Energy and Mobil, are exploring for 
oil in disputed areas in the South China Sea, with Crestone 
enjoying the protection of the Chinese navy. Mobil obtained its 
permit from Vietnam. 
  Alcorn is the operator of the West Linapacan offshore 
production site off the western island of Palawan, the only 
wells in commercial production in the Philippines. 
  Water intrusion has drastically reduced production to about 
3,500 barrels per day from 15,000 bpd last year, but the 
consortium plans to boost output to about 6,000 bpd following 
the drilling of a sidetrack well last month.

  [Text] Answering reporters' questions at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs this morning about news reports that the United 
States has sent military officials to provide training for 
Cambodian officials, Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong 
Sunsiri said the United States is entitled to do so. That is, 
he said, because a request may have been made by the new 
Government of Cambodia, which is in the stage of national 
rehabilitation. The provision of assistance in the form of 
training courses or the supply of military uniforms, which is 
aimed at making Cambodian officials perfect soldiers, is 
acceptable. The practice is the same as Thailand's assistance 
to Cambodia in the field of public health and military uniforms, 
which were requested by the Cambodian Government. Therefore, 
there should be no problem. 
  On the question of the Khmer Rouge opposing such assistance 
by the United States, the Thai foreign minister said the Khmer 
Rouge may have been incorrect in their opposition because the 
assistance was made in the form of training not arms supplies. 
  The foreign minister also reiterated that ASEAN countries 
have maintained their stances supporting a solution to the 
Cambodian problem through compromise and not by supporting armed 
conflict. 
  Regarding the news that Malaysia will provide weapons to 
Cambodia, Prasong said he had received no facts nor information 
about this and therefore does not want to comment on it. 
  The foreign minister was asked about the Burmese dissident 
students at the Maniloi camp in Rat Buri Province, who are 
calling for the rights and freedom of Burmese people and who may 
wish to protest the presence of Burmese Government 
representatives attending the ASEAN ministerial meeting 
scheduled for July in Bangkok. The foreign minister said the 
Burmese students, who were placed in the camp provided by Thai 
authorities, have lived quite comfortably. Therefore, they 
should not make any political moves in Thailand. He thought that 
officials and agencies concerned, such as the Ministry of 
Interior, should prepare measures to prevent the Burmese 
students from using Thai territory to commit illegitimate acts. 
Regarding security measures for the ASEAN ministerial meeting 
which Thailand will host in July, authorities are believed to 
have worked on it and do not think there will be any problems.

  [Text] Vietnam was adjusting its foreign policy in order to 
serve the country's top priorities to meet its economic 
development. This was said by Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai in 
an international investment seminar in Hanoi. 
  He said: Vietnam has no time for getting involve in 
hostilities in neighboring Cambodia. On military aid to 
Cambodia, Mr. Le Mai said: It was no longer Vietnam's duty to 
do that. Vietnam did once and that was enough. Now it's turn 
for other countries if they want to help the Cambodian 
Government fight against the Khmer Rouge. 
  Mr. Le Mai also said the United States will soon open a 
diplomatic mission in Vietnam and that the only remaining 
obstacle was the difficulty in finding suitable accommodation in 
Hanoi. He said economic development was a top priority for 
Vietnam.

representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency and

  [Text] In connection with China's abstaining from voting, 
Yun Ho-chin, North Korean representative to the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and councillor at the DPRK Mission 
in Vienna, said on 10 June: "Even if China takes part in the 
sanctions, there is nothing to be surprised about. China has 
its own opinion and we live according to our own opinion." 
  [Correspondent] What do you think about the IAEA adopting 
the resolution? 
  [Yun Ho-chin] We are finished with the IAEA. We cannot 
accept the IAEA's conduct in which it is distorting the truth in 
accordance with the direction and theory of the United States. 
  [Correspondent] Then will you withdraw from the IAEA? 
  [Yun] No. However, the resolution has the same meaning as 
telling us to withdraw. 
  [Correspondent] What will happen if you do not receive any 
technological assistance? 
  [Yun] In reality, it has been suspended since last year. If 
an objective third party studies and assesses our proposal on 
the discharge and measurement of the fuel rods, all the 
technological problems will be solved. 
  [Correspondent] What will you do now? 
  [Yun] We will take strong countermeasures. If someone tries 
to kill us we must defend ourselves. 
  [Correspondent] What do you mean by a strong countermeasure? 
  [Yun] That will be decided upon by Pyongyang. 
  [Correspondent] Will you reprocess plutonium in three months 
time from the replaced fuel rods? 
  [Yun] I am not in the position to talk about this matter, 
but if necessary it will be carried out. Even if reprocessing 
work is carried out, we will not notify the IAEA [chaechorirul

  [Text] Seoul, June 9 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and China have 
agreed to increase two-way trade from 9 billion U.S. dollars 
last year to 30 billion dollars in 1997. 
  At a Korea-China trade ministers' meeting held here 
Thursday, 
Chinese Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister Wu Yi 
said China would lower both tariff and non-tariff barriers for 
imports from South Korea. 
  Under the agreement, Daewoo Motor of Korea and a Chinese 
company will shortly conclude a barter contract to exchange 
5,000 Daewoo cars for Chinese corn and machine parts. The 
contract will signal Korea's first car exports to China: 
previously, used Korean cars have been sold illegally in China. 
  Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su requested 
that China open its car market so that Korean automakers can 
produce vehicles in joint ventures in China. 
  Kim also asked for Chinese cooperation in Yukong's oil 
refinery construction project in Shenzhen, Daewoo's car parts 
factory project in Shandong Province and the Korea business 
center's construction project in Beijing, to which Wu responded 
positively. 
  In addition, Kim and Wu agreed to promote bilateral 
cooperation in automobiles, medium-sized aircraft, electronic 
telephone switching systems and high-definition television. 
  On China's application for GATT (General Agreement on 
Tariffs 
and Trade) membership, Wu asked for Korea's support and Kim said 
Seoul would cooperate as Beijing carries out trade reform to 
join GATT.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 11 KYODO -- The United States has 
demanded in the resumed "framework" trade talks that Japanese 
automakers adopt specific purchase plans for U.S.-made parts, 
government sources said Saturday. 
  The demand for the purchase plans as part of "objective 
criteria" for improving foreign access to the Japanese market 
was made in subcabinet-level framework talks on auto trade held 
Friday and Saturday in Tokyo, the sources said. 
  U.S. officials also demanded as part of the criteria that 
Japanese-owned auto assembly plants in the U.S. increase the 
local content ratio in their production, the sources said. 
  The Japanese side did not directly respond to the U.S. 
demands and asked that further discussions be held at the 
working-level talks starting Monday, they said. 
  Japan told the U.S. at the beginning of the resumed talks 
that it would not accept any numerical targets as objective 
criteria for improving market access in Japan. 
  At the talks, both Japan and the U.S. presented their own 
versions of a draft agreement on auto trade, the sources said. 
  U.S. officials also asked that a bilateral agreement 
incorporate plans for purchases of U.S.-made auto parts that 
five Japanese automakers recently announced, the sources said. 
  An official of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry told reporters that serious differences remain on key 
issues of auto trade in the talks.

Japan's chief government spokesman said Saturday there is a 
strong possibility of the UN Security Council adopting a 
resolution in a week or 10 days against North Korea over the 
nuclear standoff. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai made the comment in 
a 
speech in Hamamatsu. 
  The Security Council is expected to begin debating next week 
a resolution the United States plans to submit calling for 
sanctions against North Korea because of its rejection of 
unhindered access to nuclear facilities suspected of being used 
for nuclear arms development.

  [Text] Senior officials from major Japanese and U.S. firms 
in the semiconductor industry held a meeting on 9 June, followed 
by a joint news conference later on. The Japanese and U.S. 
Governments are to hold discussions to make a decision by July 
on whether to terminate the bilateral semiconductor agreement 
ahead of its scheduled expiration in July 1996. However, 
differences in opinion between the two nations have come into 
the picture, for Japan is calling for an early termination of 
the agreement while the United States insists that it remain in 
effect. 
  At the news conference, Hidehiko Yoshida (vice president of 
the Toshiba Corporation), chairman of the Users Committee of 
Foreign Semiconductors, who represented the Japanese side, 
emphasized that "the situation between the Japanese and U.S. 
industries is satisfactory in terms of cooperative ties." Gil 
Amelio (president of the National Semiconductor Corporation), 
chairman of the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), 
also pointed out that the "U.S. and Japanese semiconductor 
industries have become more and more mutually dependent." 
  As for the bilateral semiconductor agreement, however, 
Yoshida said: "The foundation has been laid for the industries 
of both nations to continue cooperating. The private sector 
should be left alone to look after its own affairs." He thus 
indicated that the private sector wants the Japanese and U.S. 
Governments to promptly terminate the semiconductor arrangement. 
  However, Amelio clearly indicated opposition to terminating 
the arrangement, saying: "The semiconductor agreement has 
brought progress in establishing cooperative ties between the 
U.S. and Japanese industries. Therefore, the arrangement should 
be continued." 
  A "20-percent" share of Japan's market for foreign 
semiconductors has been designated as a target goal in the 
semiconductor agreement. Regarding this point, Yoshida said: "In 
the past, this figure has tended to take on a life beyond the 
purpose for which it was originally intended. I feel it is no 
longer necessary to set figures." In contrast, Wilf Corrigan 
(chairman of LSI Logic), a member of the SIA Board of Directors, 
stressed, "Figures are needed to measure progress."

  [Text] Mrs. Mutsuko Miki, widow of the late former Prime 
Minister Takeo Miki, will visit the DPRK (North Korea) on a 
week-long stay. She is one of the women who have called for the 
establishment of a Japan-ROK-DPRK women's organization called 
"Peace in Asia and the Role of Women" which holds seminars to 
discuss such issues as the resolution of the conflict between 
the ROK and the DPRK and Japan's postwar settlements. When she 
attended a seminar held in Pyongyang in 1992, she received a 
direct invitation from DPRK President Kim Il-song to visit North 
Korea together with her family. She said she accepted the 
invitation, in the hope that it might "help contribute to the 
promotion of Japan-DPRK exchanges." 
  In connection with the DPRK nuclear issue, there is a rush 
of 
visits to the DPRK by Japanese politicians. For example, the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan has already sent a delegation, 
and House of Representatives members Taku Yamazaki and Yoichi 
Tani of the Liberal Democratic Party are scheduled to visit on 
14 June. Amid the flurry of political visits, Mrs. Miki said: 
"I have been making preparations since late last year. There 
are no plans for me to meet government officials (in connection 
with the nuclear issue). It is purely a family trip."

<F P=106> [Article by economic reporter Makoto Imazawa: "If </F>
Remittances to North Korea Are Stopped, Impact Will Not Be 
Small"] 
  [Text] While tensions are rising over the issue of the 
DPRK's (North Korea) nuclear suspicion, the question of banning 
remittances to North Korea is being raised. The Foreign 
Exchange Control Law governs remittances overseas and, in the 
past, there have been instances of remittances banned on Iraq 
and Libya pursuant to UN resolutions on sanctions. But among 
bank officials there are now growing voices saying, "An impact 
from suspension of remittances to North Korea, with which Japan 
has deep relations, will be different from those of the past." 
<H5>  Ashikaga Bank Is the Sole Channel </H5>
  Japanese banks, which want to remit money overseas, need to 
have agreements with overseas banks on receiving and paying of 
such remittances. This arrangement is called a "correspondent 
contract." As far as dealings with North Korea are concerned, 
there are now 18 Japanese banks that have such a contract with 
Choson Foreign Trade Bank [CFTB] (main office in Pyongyang). 
  But the correspondent contracts agree only on how the 
remittances are instructed and how payment is settled. For 
people to be able to actually remit money, they have to have 
payments settled at a bank that has an account with the CFTB. 
  The only Japanese bank that has a two-way deposit account 
with the CFTB is said to be Ashikaga Bank (main office in 
Utsunomiya city). A banking source explained: "It appears that 
the arrangement is made so that not just the Japanese banks but 
also all banks throughout the world have to go through Ashikaga 
Bank when they remit money to North Korea. The currency dealt 
with is not only yen, but all other major currencies, including 
dollar and pound." The source added that until last year, money 
had been remitted through several banks including London 
branches of Asian banks, but "early in the fall last year, North 
Korea asked all payments to be made to its account with Ashikaga 
Bank. 
<H5>  Dollar-Based Remittances Already Suspended </H5>
  At the end of March, Ashikaga Bank notified all banks that 
it 
was suspending its functions as an intermediary for remitting 
dollar-based money to North Korea. Until then, banks that 
wanted to make dollar-based remittances to North Korea normally 
asked Tokyo branches of U.S. banks to pay Ashikaga Bank for it 
to make the remittances. But Ashikaga Bank is thought to have 
stopped acting as an intermediary as it expected the U.S. 
Government's watch on it to grow more wary as a result of the 
nuclear issue. However, one said: "Dollar-based remittances to 
North Korea were in small amounts to begin with; an impact from 
it will be not much." Besides, remittances in yen and pound are 
still possible. 
  A measure to control remittances that the government is 
studying now envisions subjecting all remittances overseas from 
Japan to government approval, thus tightening flows of money 
into North Korea. Article 16 of the Foreign Exchange Control 
Law provides that if neccesary, "for faithful implementation of 
treaties and other international commitments," the government 
can subject the remittances from Japan to other countries to its 
approval, and this provision was exercised for the first time 
against Iraq in the wake of the Gulf crisis. Since then, it has 
been applied on Serbia, Montenegro, Haiti, and Libya. 
<H5>  Remittances Through Third Nations Cannot be Controlled </H5>
  Among bankers there are voices questioning the effectiveness 
of a Japanese Government action intended to stop remittances to 
North Korea. They note that if new channels of remittances -- 
going through such third countries as Hong Kong and China -- are 
used, there will be no way of controlling flows of money into 
North Korea. A man said: "If the government wants to control 
those going through third countries, it will have to watch and 
inquire into all remittances overseas. That will take enormous 
costs, and it is questionable, despite all that, if the 
government can determine what is really happening." 
  But if all the nations of the world do control remittances 
into that country, there is no doubt that it will become 
difficult for foreign currencies to flow into that country. In 
particular, Japan's suspension of remittances means that the 
payment account of Japan's only existing bank with a payment 
account [with a North Korean bank] will become useless. As 
such, "an impact therefrom will not be small by any means."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Economic Sanctions Face Many </F>
Problems"] 
  [Text] The three countries of Japan, the United States, 
and South Korea have begun to discuss the possible imposition of 
economic sanctions against the DPRK (North Korea) over its 
suspected nuclear development program. Their basic position on 
economic sanctions is that they should follow the passing of a 
resolution by the UN Security Council. But since China is 
resistant to such a resolution, there is a possibility that 
sanctions will only be carried out by major nations such as the 
European countries plus the three countries of Japan, the United 
States, and South Korea. As there are also obstacles to making 
these sanctions effective, the government is having a difficult 
time figuring out what it should do. 
Direction of Economic Sanctions and Problems Involved [subhead] 
  If a resolution on sanctions is passed by the UN Security 
Council, they will probably be conducted -- as seen in past 
examples -- in the following steps: 1) A ban on exports of arms 
and oil; 2) a ban on trade in general; 3) restrictions on 
visits; and 4) a freeze on overseas assets and suspension of 
financial transactions. 
  Informal talks by UN Security Council members have started 
in 
New York, but before that, on 4 June, the three countries -- 
Japan, the United States, and South Korea -- held a 
working-level meeting in Washington. According to a source in 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA], during the meeting the 
United States was said to have noted: "For economic sanctions 
against North Korea to be effective, the key point will rest on 
whether exports of oil from China and monetary remittances from 
Japan can be stopped." 
  North Korea has mostly depended on China for the supply of 
petroleum products since Russia stopped supplying it with oil. 
Shortages of foreign currency reserves are serious in the 
country. As such, the United States thinks the key for economic 
sanctions to be effective is in the hands of China and Japan. 
  Economic sanctions are implemented by restricting the flow 
of 
people, commodities, and money. Japan can control personnel 
exchanges under the Immigration Law, and trade and banking 
operations under the Foreign Exchange Control Law. 
  As for trade, a top official of the Ministry of 
International 
Trade and Industry said: "We are getting ready to take action 
along the lines of a UN resolution if a resolution is decided 
upon." The ministry will be able to cope even if sanctions 
escalate into those requiring a total ban on exports or a ban on 
intermediary trade. 
  However, there will be problems if Japan wants to restrict 
monetary remittances and travel. In addition to about 15,000 
North Korean residents living in Japan who return there on 
annual visits, there are about 20,000 people coming and going 
between Japan and North Korea each year. It is has been pointed 
out that cash carried by Koreans on visits to their hometowns 
have become a major source of foreign currency for that country. 
A MOFA source noted problems from a human rights viewpoint: 
"Enforcement of sanctions in this area will be difficult." 
Moreover, under the existing law it will be difficult to be 
harsh on only visitors to North Korea and to impose restrictions 
on rules allowing each person to carry up to 5 million yen. 
Sanctions in the Past [subhead] 
  The severest action the Japanese Government has so far meted 
out as economic sanctions were those taken against Rhodesia (now 
Zimbabwe) for its policy of oppression of blacks and against 
Iraq for invading Iran. Both cases were enforced following 
sanctions decided on by the United Nations. 
  Among sanctions taken without a UN resolution were those 
taken against Iran over the incident of taking U.S. Embassy 
personnel as hostages; against the Soviet Union over its 
invasion of Afghanistan; and against China over the Tiananmen 
incident. The contents of these sanctions mostly concerned 
limiting personnel exchanges -- reducing the number of embassy 
personnel (for Iran) and reducing the number of government 
officials and other people exchanged (in the case of the Soviet 
Union and China). 
  The economic sanctions taken were lenient in nature, like 
requiring exporters to obtain prior approval on exports (to 
Iran) and freezing economic cooperation (to China). Whether or 
not Japan will go for full-scale economic sanctions against 
North Korea this time will depend on the UN Security Council 
resolution -- seen from past experiences.

<F P=106> [Article by journalist Iku Aso in cooperation with the </F>
editorial staff of BUNGEI SHUNJU: "The DPRK Will React This 
Way: `Government Internal Document' Obtained"] 
  [Text] By the time this article is read by BUNGEI SHUNJU 
readers, the tension will probably be at its peak in the 
argument over whether or not the issue of economic sanctions 
against the DPRK should be referred to the UN Security Council 
[UNSC]. 
  In fact, since the latter days of the Hosokawa regime, the 
Japanese Government, at the instruction of the prime minister's 
office, has been conducting a full-scale, confidential 
simulation by assembling several related ministries and 
government agencies. 
  This has not been publicized at all. The scale of the task 
force is so huge that a staff member of the prime minister's 
office commented that it was "the first time since the end of 
World War II that so many ministries and agencies have been 
assembled." Strict control of information has prevented word of 
it leaking out. 
  The "top secret internal document" obtained by the writer of 
this article was compiled by a Japanese Government agency and is 
titled: "In Reference to the Effects of Economic and Military 
Sanctions Against the DPRK." 
  More than 30 pages long, the confidential paper was compiled 
last November, long before the prime minister's office issued 
its specific instructions. It is, however, extremely 
interesting because the paper outlines the present government 
simulation. The analysis was made into such wide fields as: 
economic sanctions, military sanctions, reactions of various 
domestic organizations and so on, revealing serious security 
problems facing Japan. Let me introduce the contents. 
1. Effects of and Reactions to Economic Sanctions 
  (1) Predictable Forms of Economic Sanctions 
  The following actions may be considered by the Security 
Council under the authority granted by Article 41 of the UN 
Charter, namely: "complete or partial interruption of economic 
relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and 
other means of communication." 
  First, suspension of Japan-DPRK trade. 
  Second, a ban on all traffic of people and the entry of DPRK 
ships into Japanese ports. 
  Third, severance of fund remittance routes to the DPRK. 
  Fourth, restrictions on communication by telegraph and 
telephone between Japan and the DPRK. 
  Among these, the first, second and third are considered 
likely to be effective as economic sanctions against the DPRK. 
So we will now look at the effects these measures could inflict 
on DPRK and the reactions to them by DPRK and Chosen Soren 
[North Korean Residents Association in Japan]. 
  (2) Effects of Economic Sanctions 
  a. If Japan-DPRK Trade is Banned Completely 
  Trade between Japan and the DPRK in 1992 registered 4.4 
billion yen in favor of the DPRK, 28.3 billion yen in exports to 
the DPRK and 32.7 billion yen in imports from the DPRK. In the 
last six years Japan-DPRK trade has been in favor of DPRK. It 
is an important means of obtaining valuable foreign exchange for 
the DPRK and a means of procuring goods and materials difficult 
to produce domestically. When measures are taken to ban 
Japan-DPRK trade it is predicted the following effects will be 
seen. 
  * Last year's figures reveal that the major commodities 
exported from Japan to the DPRK were textiles for spinning and 
textile products, about 27 percent of the total export, followed 
by machinery, which made up about 18 percent, electrical 
machinery and tools, which comprised about 11 percent, and 
transportation machinery and tools, which made up about 8 
percent. Of single items, various textiles, aerial pumps and 
compressors, automobiles, and agricultural chemicals were the 
leaders on the export list. 
  If the DPRK was unable to import such items, its export of 
clothing to Japan using Japanese textile materials would cease 
and the DPRK economy would come to a standstill through the lack 
of machinery, transportation equipment, and tools. Stopping the 
import of agricultural chemicals would greatly escalate damage 
to DPRK agriculture, which is already suffering from noxious 
insects. 
  On the other hand, there is almost no foodstuffs or fuel 
exported from Japan to the DPRK and if trade was suspended there 
would be little effect on the DPRK as far as these items are 
concerned. 
  However, when North Koreans living in Japan travel to the 
DPRK and DPRK ships visit Japanese ports, they take out of Japan 
a considerable quantity of foodstuffs and fuel which do not 
appear on the customs statistics. When ships and people are 
prohibited from moving between the two countries, it will have a 
certain effect. (See subsection b. in case travel is banned and 
DPRK ships are prevented from entering Japanese ports) 
  * In addition, trading firms affiliated with Chosen Soren 
have long been suspected of exporting COCOM prohibited 
contraband goods to the DPRK via third countries. If this is 
true, sanctions will not be effective unless exports to third 
countries by Chosen Soren affiliated trading companies are 
stopped. In addition, an increased watchdog system may be 
necessary to prevent smuggling and secret transactions by sea. 
  (Writer's Note 1) When imposing economic sanctions, the 
DPRK's oil supply situation is a major factor. The biggest 
concern of the Japanese, U.S., and ROK Governments in imposing 
economic sanctions is the threat of "military adventure" on the 
part of DPRK. In order to prevent it, stopping oil imports 
which provide the fuel for armored troops and military aircraft 
is an absolute condition. 
  U.S. and ROK military sources differ in their assessment of 
the DPRK oil stockpile, with some guessing that the DPRK has 
fortified underground oil storage dumps. Although no figures 
are available, Western diplomatic sources in Seoul share the 
view that the DPRK probably has "six month's worth of reserves 
in store." 
  Many experts therefore point out that DPRK troops are likely 
to invade when they are left with only three to four months' 
supply of oil, judging from its ability to wage war. 
  DPRK exports Nodong-1 or Scud-C ballistic missiles and 
other, 
small-caliber, firearms to Middle East countries including Iran 
and Syria in exchange for imports of oil from these countries. 
Using a sea blockade to prevent freighters carrying on this 
trade requires not only vigilance but powerful military 
strength. The term "sea blockade" is easily used in the press, 
but in Japan there is little recognition that this is the final 
stage of "economic sanctions," meaning a "state of war." 
  On top of this, there is the little known fact that 
violations and attempts to violate Cocom [Coordinating Committee 
for Multilateral Export Controls] embargoes on DPRK have 
frequently taken place in the past. For instance, in September 
1988 the vice chairman of the Korean Association of Commerce and 
Industry in Japan was prosecuted for deceiving the Japanese 
authorities into thinking he was sending clothing aboard S.S. 
Samjiyon leaving Niigata, while he was, in fact, loading more 
than 30 corrugated cardboard boxes filled with over a 1,000 NEC 
personal computers and integrated chips which were subject to 
Cocom embargo. The incident was seen as part of organized crime 
committed by Chosen Soren and others. 
  In March 1987, a false application was submitted to the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry for a permit to 
export 700 computers to Indonesia. It was discovered that the 
export was intended for DPRK via Singapore, and the application 
was turned down. 
  It must be pointed out that Chosen Soren utilizes its 
subordinate organizations in methodically sending a large number 
of books on high-technology and that the subordinate Association 
of Science and Technology of (North) Koreans in Japan has, under 
its fold, members engaged in highly advanced technology and 
leaders who are specialists and have been trained by the 
Japanese authorities in nuclear physics. [end of note] 
  b. In Case Travel is Banned and the Entry of DPRK Ships Into 
Japanese Ports is Banned 
  Last year an aggregate total of about 6,600 North Koreans 
visited the DPRK from Japan and by August this year about 1,800 
had made the visit. About 4,300 Japanese visited DPRK last 
year. DPRK ships made a total of 510 entries to Japanese ports 
last year. 
  * When Korean residents in Japan affiliated with Chosen 
Soren visit DPRK they ship clothing, automobiles and so on to 
the DPRK as part of their handcarry luggage (treated as 
travelling goods) and goods sent under separate cover 
(automobiles and others recognized as daily use items by the 
sender) aboard DPRK ships that make port calls in Japan. 
  Aboard such ships last year, about 32 tons of rice (the 
maximum quantity a person can take out of Japan is 100 
kilograms), and a large quantity of sugar, soy sauce, cooking 
salt, automobiles, personal computers and so on (they are 
excluded from customs statistics) were sent to the DPRK as 
"takusohin" -- consignment (items sent care of the captain and 
others to be used individually by the consignee.) 
  Most such goods were either intended as gifts for various 
organizations in the DPRK or were sent to relatives of those 
visiting the country. If visits to the DPRK by North Koreans in 
Japan and the entry of DPRK ships into Japanese ports were 
banned, it would affect the work of various DPRK organizations 
and the daily lives of those who have repatriated from Japan 
(approximately 93,000 people). 
  * Among the Japanese who visited the DPRK last year, about 
600 were engaged in either trade negotiations or technical 
counselling. Japan ranks second after China as a DPRK foreign 
trade partner and the majority of the timeworn plant facilities 
in the DPRK which have been brought in from Japan need frequent 
repairs and checks. If visits by Japanese technicians were 
restricted, it presumed plant operations would be affected a 
great deal. 
  About 3,000 Japanese tourists visited DPRK last year, and 
this year about 600 have visited so far. It is said that a 
Japanese tourist spends about 50,000 yen while in DPRK, so it is 
estimated that the DPRK earns about 150 million yen annually in 
tourism revenue. The Japanese constitute the largest number of 
tourists to DPRK and a ban of their travel would certainly 
affect the DPRK's foreign exchange earnings. 
  * DPRK vessels load several times the volume of crude oil 
needed for the voyage, claiming the oil as goods needed 
following departure from Japanese ports and letting Chosen Soren 
affiliated trading companies pay the bill. 
  Assuming the 510 DPRK ships that entered Japanese ports 
last year loaded crude oil in quantities more than actually 
required, several hundred thousand tons of crude oil are 
supposed to have been transported into the DPRK. 
  Banning DPRK ships from entering Japanese ports will result 
in a lack of fuel required for voyages of these vessels. 
  c. In Case Routes of Fund Remittances Are Closed 
  Although the DPRK's foreign exchange reserves have not been 
made public, it is presumed that country is in an extremely 
serious situation, in view of the facts that the DPRK has not 
succeeded in reversing its deficit figures in foreign trade and 
that its method of trade transaction with China and Russia has 
changed from the barter system to settlement by international 
currencies. 
  In view of this, a constant flow of funds from Japan to the 
DPRK (trade payments, contributions from Chosen Soren, and so 
on) is one of the DPRK's major sources of foreign exchange. 
  * The amounts of money sent to the DPRK from Japan as 
investments in DPRK companies exceeding 30 million yen, for 
which a report to the Ministry of Finance is required; credits 
in excess of 10 million yen for non-business purposes, for which 
a report is also required; and contributions or gifts exceeding 
5 million yen except among family members totalled approximately 
1.3 billion yen in 1989, about 130 million yen in 1990, and 
about 260 million yen in 1991. In addition, about 32.7 billion 
yen was remitted to the DPRK as trade payments between the two 
countries last year. 
  These payments constitute an extremely small part of the 
remittances from Japan to the DPRK. If the payments not 
required to be reported to the Finance Ministry are counted, a 
considerably large amount of money is presumed to be sent to the 
DPRK through banks. Thus, the DPRK will be dealt with a big 
blow if remittances to the DPRK through banks are prohibited. 
  As for the Japanese banks which have signed correspondent 
transaction agreements with DPRK banks, see the diagram below. 
[Diagram 1 -- to be sent separately] 
  In addition, the Tokai Bank, Ltd., the Daiwa Bank, Ltd., the 
Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, Ltd., the Hokuriku Bank, Ltd., the 
Industrial Bank of Japan, Ltd., the Long-Term Credit Bank of 
Japan Ltd., the Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation, the 
Mitsui Trust and Banking Co., Ltd., and the Central Bank for 
Agriculture and Forestry signed correspondent contracts with the 
Foreign Trade Bank of the DPRK. 
  *Chosen Soren makes enormous contributions for various DPRK 
celebrations and brings an average of 1 million yen for each 
visitor to the DPRK as aid money for relatives living in the 
DPRK (5 million yen per person is the maximum amount one can 
take out of Japan). The organizational and individual 
contributions by Chosen Soren reportedly amount to a total of 60 
to 70 billion yen. 
  These contributions include amounts not required to be 
reported to the Ministry of Finance and amounts sent to the DPRK 
via third countries or remitted skillfully concealed in export 
goods to the DPRK. Some North Koreans living in Japan are 
suspected of taking more money than allowed as the maximum 
amount with them to the DPRK, by skillfully scattering and 
concealing them in their luggage. 
  In order to cut off remittances by Chosen Soren to the DPRK, 
therefore, it is necessary to examine such measures as stepping 
up checking into remittances via third countries and more severe 
inspections of goods exported to the DPRK, restricting travel to 
the DPRK, and lowering the ceiling on the amount of money that 
can be taken out of Japan. 
  (Writer's Note 2) When Koreans living in Japan remit money 
to 
their families in the DPRK without giving specific reasons for 
doing so, leaders of the Korean Association of Commerce and 
Industry in Japan concede that "before families receive the 
money, about 30 percent is taken off the top, under various 
pretexts, by the DPRK authorities." More serious problems exist 
as well. Because many of the leaders of the association are 
aged, anxiety is spreading among them that the DPRK Government 
may exact portions of the enormous estate left by them when 
their families attempt to bequeath the fortune. 
  In fact, a daughter in Japan and a son in the DPRK are in 
legal dispute over a inheritance following the death of their 
father, an important association member from Mito City, Ibaragi 
Prefecture. It is said that the DPRK authorities are behind the 
court dispute. 
  The writer has a classified document on hand entitled: "List 
of Those Who Made Large Contributions." The list says that 
leading businessmen, including operators of "pachinko"-related 
businesses, are making large contributions (more than 100 
million yen a person on such occasions as Kim Il-song's 
birthday). Everyone associated with the Chosen Soren knows this. 
  (Writer's Note 2 -- continued) According to a simulation 
conducted at the Ministry of Finance, "banning payments" 
(freezing remittances, receipts and payments -- so-called 
freezing of assets) defined in Article 16 of the Foreign 
Exchange Law, will be amended from a license-system notice. 
Payments "not authorized," which provide for "banning grants of 
foreign credits" and "banning direct investments," will be 
regulated by ordinances of the Ministry of Finance. 
Preparations are under way to issue a joint amendment with the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry for ordinances 
which provide for "banning providing services and labor." 
  But many Japanese Government experts say in unison that it 
is 
impossible to completely stop the remittances by North Koreans 
living in Japan. 
  For example, it is said to be impossible to get hold of 
remittances when a North Korean resident in Japan sends money to 
an account in a Swiss bank accessible only by a secret 
identification number or an account opened under a foreigner's 
name, or DPRK diplomats carry money with them or money sent by 
diplomatic pouch via third countries. 
  In recent days, there are many instances of remitting money 
to the DPRK after collecting it overseas, rather than directly 
remitting it from Japan. [end of note] 
  (3) Reactions of the DPRK and Chosen Soren 
  a. The DPRK 
  Domestic Reaction 
  When concerned nations impose economic sanctions in 
accordance with a United Nations resolution demanding economic 
sanctions against the DPRK, the following trends are considered 
possible. 
  *Frequent Riots May Occur Due To Food Shortages 
  It has so far been reported that the DPRK has witnessed 
riots 
due to food shortages. Serious food shortages may spread once 
economic sanctions are imposed. If riots take place 
continuously throughout the country and are organized as a form 
of outrage against the present system, they may quite possibly 
lead to the collapse of the present regime. 
  In order to avoid such a situation, the DPRK party and 
government will tighten its control of people's thoughts and 
step up arrests and imprisonments of rebels. 
  *Exodus of DPRK Residents 
  It is thought that when the domestic economy of the DPRK 
becomes impoverished and food shortages become worse due to 
economic sanctions, cases of DPRK residents escaping to China or 
Russia or attempting to seek asylum in the ROK will occur, but 
the number of such cases may be small unless the DPRK's current 
system collapses. The DPRK party and government are expected to 
strengthen border patrols to prevent such actions from occurring 
in large numbers. 
  *Seeking Assistance From Friendly Nations 
  The DPRK may seek assistance from China to overcome economic 
sanctions. Bilateral trade between China and the DPRK is about 
700 million dollars. Of this, the frontier trade between the 
DPRK and China's three northeast provinces amounts to $100 
million. Furthermore, smuggling is reported to be rampant along 
the border between the two countries. If the DPRK can 
acquisition vital goods such as oil and food from China, making 
good use of geographical advantage, economic sanctions cannot 
expect to yield results. Therefore, as long as China does not go 
along with economic sanctions and show a cooperative response, 
economic sanctions may be less effective. 
  *Requests for Chosen Soren Assistance 
  The DPRK may request that Chosen Soren help acquire 
materials 
and provide foreign exchange. For Chosen Soren to carry this 
out while sending materials and money from Japan to the DPRK is 
banned, it may resort to smuggling or sending material via third 
countries in order to avoid Japanese safeguards. 
  There is a possibility that the DPRK may attempt to take 
over 
a total of approximately 2,400 billion yen held by the Chosen 
Credit Union in Japan, an organization subordinate to the Chosen 
Soren, by claiming that the money belongs to the DPRK. 
  *Decline of Military Strength 
  The DPRK may face difficulties in maintaining its military 
strength due to the declining morale of its soldiers caused -- 
in addition to food shortages -- by shortages of fuel for 
aircraft, battleships, and military vehicles. 
  *Military Repulsion 
  The DPRK may attempt to keep up a stubborn posture 
externally 
and attempt to solidify the people's unity by putting the 
country in a semi-warlike state (ordered in March this year in 
reaction to Team Spirit, a joint U.S.-ROK military exercise). 
When the situation develops into such a state that the domestic 
economy goes completely broke and the system faces a crisis, it 
is expected to threaten concerned countries by test-launching 
missiles and concentrating its troops along the border in order 
to imply that continued economic sanctions are dangerous. Also, 
it cannot be denied that the DPRK would be prepared to launch 
missiles and may actually attack ships on watch duty at sea if 
concerned nations impose a sea blockade in order to maximize the 
effectiveness of economic sanctions. 
  *Countermeasures Against Japan 
  The DPRK announced the following countermeasures when the 
Japanese Government imposed sanctions against the DPRK following 
the bombing of a Korean Air passenger plane: 
  1. DPRK diplomats will cease all contacts with Japanese 
diplomats. 
  2. Japan's national public service personnel and 
pro-government personalities are banned from entering the DPRK. 
  3. When Japanese fishing boats illegally trespass in the 
DPRK's exclusive economic zone, their fishermen will be punished 
according to law. 
  The above-mentioned measures could be an acknowledgement of 
the effects basically caused by the sanctions measures imposed 
by the Japanese Government, which Japan enforced in a passive 
manner. 
  Therefore, the DPRK is expected to respond to the Japanese 
Government's imposition of economic sanctions measures such as 
severing economic and personal exchanges with our country. In 
concrete form, these are presumed to be as follows: 
  *Stopping Payments on Trade Liabilities 
  Approximately 90 percent of Japan-DPRK trade is handled by 
businesses and firms operated by North Koreans living in Japan. 
Therefore, these businesses and companies are expected to be 
driven into financial difficulties. 
  *Banning Fishing Inside the DPRK's Exclusive Economic Zone 
  Fishing inside the exclusive economic zone may be banned and 
either abrogation or refusal to renew the private fishing 
agreement between Japan and the DPRK (to expire on December 31 
this year) will be considered. Even if fishing inside the 
economic zone is not prohibited, it is expected that Japanese 
fishing boats may be illegally apprehended, detained, and 
severely punished. 
  *Breaking Off Intergovernmental Negotiations 
  The DPRK steadfastly maintains the posture that it would not 
respond to Japan-DPRK normalization negotiations as long as the 
Japanese side insists on a solution to the nuclear issue as a 
precondition. The DPRK may reiterate its inflexible position 
for domestic consumption -- so the people can see their 
government's "resolute stance" -- rather than impose sanctions 
against Japan. 
  *Restriction of Human Traffic 
  Japanese have been restricted from entering the DPRK since 
late May this year; when such restrictions will be cancelled is 
not known. If the DPRK's restrictions on visits by Japanese are 
not cancelled by the time economic sanctions are imposed, such 
restrictions will continue. 
  b. Chosen Soren 
  If Japan starts to impose economic sanctions against the 
DPRK, Chosen Soren is expected to bring up the issue of the 
suspension of human traffic as a humanitarian problem. Chosen 
Soren will demand the cancellation of sanctions and stage 
furious protest activities at Japanese Government organizations, 
United Nations agencies in Japan, and the U.S. Embassy. In this 
event, it is possible that certain outlaw elements may commit 
violence against those on watch duty, and illegally destroy and 
inflict damages on related facilities. These elements are also 
expected to react excessively to criticism from the mass media 
and right-wing organizations opposing the DPRK and to launch 
violent counterattacks. 
  Following the DPRK's announcement of its intention to 
withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], Chosen 
Soren insisted that "the organization must wholeheartedly 
support the DPRK people who are staging a heroic struggle to 
defend their fatherland and to build up their economy." It sent 
foodstuffs and clothing to the DPRK People's Army and made 
enormous contributions on such occasions as the birthday of 
President Kim Il-song, the 40th anniversary of the ceasefire of 
the Korean War, the founding anniversary of the Workers' Party 
of Korea, and so on. In addition, it is sending versatile 
production facilities and tools to the DPRK. These include a 
"vaccine production plant" to prevent type-B hepatitis, which is 
said to be spreading due to food and sanitation problems, and 
the "Mankyongdae Clothing Plant," which has been set up to earn 
foreign exchange. 
  While the international community is hotly debating the 
possibility of economic sanctions following the DPRK's 
declaration to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty, central cadres have been telling local chapters that "we 
have to support the economy of the DPRK, even by illegitimate 
means, in case economic sanctions are imposed against the 
republic." In this connection, Chosen Soren is expected to 
further step up its support of the DPRK economy, even if 
economic sanctions are applied. Since it is on record as 
violating COCOM restrictions, it is fairly predictable that 
again it will use similarly illegitimate methods to take out 
money and materials from Japan. 
  (Writer's Note 3) Chosen Soren's chairman Han Dok-su, who is 
87 years old and has held the organization's number-one position 
for nearly 40 years, suddenly visited the DPRK in late April. 
Until recent days, he was hospitalized and growing weak due to 
breathing difficulties and dim consciousness caused by problems 
with his thyroid gland. He is thought to have gone home forever 
this time. 
  So it is said that Chosen Soren will be engulfed by a power 
struggle in the future. Properly speaking, First Vice Chairman 
Yi Chin-kyu is the closest to the chairmanship by rank order. 
But in reality, Ho Chong-man, vice chairman in charge and a 
cadre among the top leaders of the commerce and industry 
association, is far ahead in reaching true hegemony in Chosen 
Soren. It is expected that an internal struggle will continue 
until a general meeting is held next year. 
  What matters is the fact that Vice Chairman Ho Chong-man has 
broad connections in the Japanese political world and has 
engaged in active lobbying among influential Diet members 
concerning the issue of economic sanctions against the DPRK. It 
is feared that political maneuvering is being staged in favor of 
the DPRK. [end of note] 
  2. Effects and Reactions of Military Sanctions 
  (1) Predictable Forms of Military Sanctions 
  As for military sanctions against the DPRK, the Security 
Council is given such authority by Article 42 of the United 
Nations Charter: "action by air, sea, or land forces as may be 
necessary to maintain or restore international peace and 
security (including demonstrations, blockades, and other 
operations)." In theory, the following actions are considered 
possible: 
  1. Coercion by deployment of military strength, such as 
conducting large-scale maneuvers. 
  2. Sea blockades to maintain the effectiveness of economic 
sanctions. 
  3. Attacks by exclusive use of aircraft and missiles. 
  3-1. Limited attacks against nuclear development-related 
facilities and missile bases. 
  3-2. Limited attacks to eliminate the DPRK's supreme leader. 
  3-3. Large-scale attacks to make the DPRK's military 
strength powerless. 
  4. An allout invasion by land, sea, and air forces to occupy 
either partial or the whole territory of the DPRK. 
  Among the realistically possible measures that can be taken 
against the DPRK in relation to the nuclear issue are: 1, 2, 
3-1 and 3-2. 
  Next, the effects these measures will have on the DPRK and 
the reaction of the DPRK and Chosen Soren against them will be 
examined. 
  (2) Effects of Military Sanctions 
  a. If either measure 1 (coercion by force) or measure 2 (sea 
blockade) mentioned above is adopted: 
  The DPRK will inevitably have to strengthen its combat 
mobilization readiness to the highest level in order to resist 
such a measure. 
  In that case, the DPRK will presumably mobilize its massive 
organization of men in the reserve and militia (thought to be 
approximately 4-5 million men, about one-fifth of the whole 
population); and additionally redeploy a considerable number of 
regular People's Army troops who have been dispatched to many 
sectors of the economy including construction sites, from 
production to the military field to step up combat mobilization 
readiness. When that occurs, the economic sector will have to 
bear a serious burden. And if the situation drags on for a long 
time, shouldering the burden of maintaining combat mobilization 
readiness is expected to become unbearable for the economy, 
which is already in a wretched situation and faces many 
difficulties. 
  If this situation turns out to be a reality, it is 
considered 
possible that criticism from every social stratum will pour out 
against Secretary Kim Chong-il -- who is reputed to be the 
planner as well as promoter of the stubborn foreign policy -- 
for inviting such a situation. Meanwhile, incited by "external 
threats," chauvinistic as well as nationalistic sentiments may 
well be enhanced at the same time. It is therefore difficult to 
determine whether the DPRK leadership's authority will 
immediately become shaky. 
  b. If measure 3-1 (attacks on nuclear facilities and so on) 
mentioned above is adopted: 
  The United States will most likely launch or lead limited 
bombing on specific facilities and the operation will probably 
be highly successful militarily (destroying the targets with 
minor damage to the attacker), when the United States' and the 
DPRK's military hardware is compared. 
  Under these circumstances, Secretary Kim Chong-il, who 
recently assumed the most responsible military position in the 
DPRK, will suffer an inevitable fall in his authority. In 
combination with an inquiry into who is responsible for bringing 
about the results of pursuing a stubborn foreign policy, 
criticism of Kim Chong-il may surface. 
  In addition, the military will once again be aroused to 
recognize the poor quality of its equipment and leading cadres 
may criticize the whole military policy centered around 
party-led "thought." 
  c. If measure 3-2 (attacks on the supreme leader) mentioned 
above is adopted: 
  The United States has a past record of carrying out military 
action (bombing and missile attacks) apparently intended to 
eliminate (kill) the supreme leaders of Libya and Iraq. It 
cannot be denied that similar military action may be taken 
against the DPRK, based on the understanding that the 
elimination of both Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il might hopefully 
bring about a change in that country's political system. 
  As past experiences shows, however, these operations did not 
accomplish their objectives and it is highly unpredictable as to 
which of the following results will be brought about if the 
operation is launched: 
  (a) Both Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il die. 
  (b) Kim Il-song survives, while Kim Chong-il dies. 
  (c) Kim Il-song dies, while Kim Chong-il survives. 
  (d) Both Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il survive. 
  In the case of (a), as a short-term effect, national unity 
will be solidified as the result of anger at the killing of 
their leaders. But after the excitement dies down, a succession 
struggle for leadership will take place following the loss of 
absolute centripetal force; the authority of the party and 
government will be gone, thus developing a situation in which 
the possibility of the regime's collapse is undeniable. 
  In the case of (b), the confusion envisaged in case (a) will 
not occur immediately because Kim Il-song is alive. But in 
consideration of Kim Il-song's advanced age, it is inevitable 
that unrest will occur among the leadership with respect to 
expectations revolving around the succession problem. Moreover, 
considerable unrest can be anticipated because there would be no 
immediate successor on the death of Kim Il-song, such as Kim 
Chong-il who has been prepared over a long time. 
  In the case of (c), it is expected that the effects of 
solidified unity centered around Kim Chong-il will occur. In 
this case, there is high probability that asking Kim Chong-il to 
take responsibility as supreme military leader as mentioned 
earlier will not surface immediately, because indignation over 
the killing of Kim Il-song will surpass considerations of the 
former. 
  In the case of (d), the authority of Kim Chong-il as supreme 
military leader will be promoted and there is a considerably 
strong possibility that it may serve to strengthen the system, 
because propaganda then becomes possible claiming "the enemy 
attack has been repulsed" on top of domestic indignation over 
such an attack. 
  (Writer's Note 4) Another factor to be taken into 
consideration is the health of 88-year-old President Kim 
Il-song. In spite of various rumors, little data is available. 
  The clinical records of Kim Il-song, whom a former East 
German secret police surgeon examined in Pyongyang, were made 
available in the West after the Cold War came to an end. 
According to them, President Kim Il-song is suffering from 
hearing difficulties, high blood pressure, and heart trouble 
which requires the aid of a pacemaker. The well-known goiter 
behind his neck (photographs and television images intentionally 
do not to show it) has become larger lately and its removal is 
impossible because the blood vessels within it are very complex. 
It has been diagnosed as a benign tumor. [end of note] 
  (3) The DPRK and Chosen Soren's Response and Their Effects 
on Japan 
  a. The DPRK 
  (a) Forms of Response: 
  From an outsider's perspective, the DPRK has frequently 
taken 
unpredictable actions and it is therefore extremely difficult to 
forecast how it will respond if emergency measures such as 
sanctions are taken. But theoretically, its general responses 
are presumably: 
  *"Flexibility": Realistic responses to settle the nuclear 
issue will be shown in the making of new compromise proposals, 
reopening of interrupted negotiations, and so on. 
  *"Propaganda": By stepping up external propaganda to stress 
"the DPRK is a victim of U.S. power policy" and making appeals 
to win the sympathy of world opinion, it will aim at stopping 
sanctions from being imposed. 
  *"Threats": It will make public that the DPRK will launch 
appropriate armed retaliation against concerned nations (the 
ROK, Japan, and the like) if sanction measures such as the sea 
blockade are not suspended. This is aimed at applying pressure 
on the concerned countries to win the suspension of sanctions. 
  *"Terrorism": Letting DPRK agents, foreigners, ROK citizens, 
and North Koreans living abroad engage in terrorist activities 
against the countries involved in sanctions. With the DPRK's 
involvement in such schemes remaining hidden, this is aimed at 
winning the suspension of sanctions and retaliation (there may 
be occasions when both propaganda and threats are used at the 
same time). 
  *"Retaliation": Limited military retaliatory actions 
(missile attacks on specific areas, for example) to a degree 
corresponding to sanctions will be taken. 
  *"War": In declaring the DPRK deems sanctions "a declaration 
of war," it will begin an allout armed invasion of the ROK. 
  (b) Various Sanctions and Predictable Responses 
  The responses listed above will be specifically made in 
response to the form of sanctions taken and they are as follows: 
  In the case of measure 1 (armed threats) or measure 2 (sea 
blockade), the DPRK is expected to mainly carry out "propaganda" 
and at times it will be mixed with "threats" and "terrorist 
acts," to shake up international opinion and have sanctions 
canceled in the end. But if sanctions are imposed for an 
extended period of time and the domestic economy is driven to an 
unbearably difficult state, there is a chance of "flexibility." 
  Regarding measure 3-1 (attacks on nuclear facilities), there 
is a high probability the DPRK -- based on the judgment that 
"armed retaliation increases the possibility of far larger 
attacks from opponents and leads to a crisis in the system" -- 
will attempt to wage a propaganda war to win the sympathy of 
international opinion, thus restoring its authority. But if the 
DPRK comes to the conclusion that such a lukewarm response will 
not recover its fallen authority and put down discontent among 
the military, the possibility of its choosing "terror" and 
"retaliation" cannot be eliminated. 
  Regarding measure 3-2 (attacks on the supreme leader), the 
result of the attack will produce varied responses. Generally 
speaking, the more serious the unrest within the system, the 
greater the possibility it will react violently in despair. On 
the other hand, if the system's stability is maintained, a 
self-controlled response is expected in place of a radical one. 
  (c) Effects on Japan 
  If the DPRK shows the above-mentioned responses, Japan will 
be affected in the following ways: 
  *"Propaganda" 
  If some sort of sanctions are imposed on the DPRK including 
real military attacks, a sea blockade, and armed coercion, and 
Japan is involved in some way -- especially if they allow U.S. 
Forces in Japan to use their bases to assist such measures -- 
seasoned pro-DPRK elements as well as a considerably large force 
consisting of so-called "peace loving organizations" and so on 
within Japan, are expected to show a critical response; there is 
a great possibility DPRK propaganda will win a considerable 
amount of sympathy and support within domestic opinion. 
  *"Threats" 
  If U.S. bases in Japan are used in a sea blockade and armed 
coercion against the DPRK and the DPRK makes it clear that these 
bases will be attacked by force including missiles unless the 
use of the bases is stopped, it is possible that the 
above-mentioned groups will assert Japan will be dragged into a 
war; make appeals to stop Japan's involvement in military 
sanctions; and they will be supported by residents on the 
periphery of the bases, thus dividing national opinion. 
  *"Terrorism" 
  If the DPRK carries out terrorist actions in Japan, it will 
likely: 1) Dispatch DPRK agents; 2) utilize South and North 
Koreans in Japan under its influence; or 3) hire international 
terrorist organizations. In view of the character of Japanese 
society which has experienced hardly any terrorist threats and 
existing security preparedness, the DPRK's actions will be 
comparatively easy to execute; the ensuing human and material 
losses will be heavy and serious social unrest will follow. 
  *"Retaliation" 
  Regarding armed attacks against Japan, the DPRK is 
supposedly 
able to: 1) Launch Nodong-type missiles; 2) conduct air 
bombings; 3) use submarines to intercept and attack Japanese 
ships; and 4) launch army troops to land on Japanese soil. Of 
these, items 2, 3, and 4 have a low possibility of success when 
the DPRK's military capability is compared with Japan's defense 
capability. Realistically speaking, it is highly inconceivable 
they will be adopted. 
  But, as to item 1), Japan has no effective defense methods 
-- 
as generally discussed -- and if the missiles are loaded with 
chemical warheads, there will be heavy damage. 
  *"War" 
  If large-scale hostility breaks out on the Korean Peninsula, 
needless to say Japan will be subject to direct and indirect 
effects, including a large influx of refugees. 
  b. Chosen Soren 
  Chosen Soren is expected to launch a multitude of propaganda 
critical of sanctions, whatever form they may take. It will 
presumably stage furious protest actions including demonstration 
marches to Japanese Government organizations, the U.S. Embassy 
in Japan, and U.S. Force's facilities in Japan. 
  And in that process, activists carried away by passion may 
conceivably attempt to break into buildings en bloc or assault 
guards. 
  Since March this year, when tension started to mount in 
connection with the DPRK, Chosen Soren began making repeated 
appeals to members of "Haksup-cho" Study Unit -- (an 
organizational entity of the Workers' Party of Korea, consisting 
of activists over 18 years of age who pledge absolute allegiance 
to Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il, father and son) -- to 
unconditionally support the instructions given by Secretary Kim 
Chong-il, and to live or die with the secretary. 
  In this connection, it is highly probable that mass violence 
and disturbances will occur like during the time of "Minchong" 
-- the Democratic Front for Unification of the Koreas in Japan 
-- as the result of highly elated anti-Japanese and anti-U.S. 
sentiment, if military sanctions mentioned above in 3) or 4) are 
imposed. 
  Especially if President Kim Il-song and Secretary Kim 
Chong-il are killed, it is undeniable that under DPRK 
instructions, Chosen Soren will resort to retaliatory actions 
including terror. 
  However, it is also highly conceivable that unrest will 
spread within the organization, and more and more activists and 
members will leave when criticism mounts as Chosen Soren resorts 
to organized and premeditated subversive violence, because about 
90 percent of members are second through fourth generation born 
and raised in Japan. Confrontation between the radical group 
centered around the Study Units and the group critical of 
violence is expected, and this may develop into internal splits. 
(Other details omitted) 
  [Writer's note] An important problem completely left out in 
Japanese mass media reports is "panic." 
  As the confidential paper points out: "Japanese society has 
hardly ever experienced terrorist threats," and it is not an 
exaggeration to say that panic is a characteristic trait of the 
Japanese. 
  As one of the DPRK's methods is to cause panic through 
small-scale terrorism and military attacks, Japan needs to have 
risk management. 
  At the Prime Minister's Office, simulations are being 
considered by three agencies -- the Cabinet Security Affairs 
Office, Cabinet Information Research Office, and Foreign 
Ministry's Consolidated Foreign Policy Bureau with Deputy Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Nobuo Ishihara presiding. But the trouble is 
the instability of the Hata regime. 
  Depending on the Chinese attitude, it is certain that 
U.S.-led multi-national economic sanctions -- not at the UN 
level -- are inevitable, driving a Japan deprived of the royal 
banner of the United Nations into an extremely difficult 
situation. It requires strong political leadership but the Hata 
cabinet cannot be relied on to tackle the biggest security 
problem since the end of World War II. On the contrary, the 
Hata cabinet includes one minister suspected of having friendly 
relations with Chosen Soren. 
  From whom can we expect the political power of manly 
decisions, unafraid of DPRK intimidation? [end note]
