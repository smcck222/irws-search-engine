  [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] edged gingerly 
toward a grand alliance with its onetime archenemy Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) in intensifying political maneuverings 
Monday while the coalition of caretaker Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata remained on the sidelines. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama met separately with the heads 
of the LDP and the tiny New Party Sakigake, a splinter party 
from the LDP, in efforts to consolidate its standing in forming 
a new cabinet following Hata's resignation announced Saturday. 
  Murayama and LDP President Yohei Kono agreed to seek 
election 
of a new premier Tuesday, and both parties later ruled out an 
extension of the term of the current 150-day regular Diet 
session, which expires Wednesday. 
  Murayama and Kono also concurred in jointly taking "heavy 
responsibility" for breaking the current political standoff in 
order to pave the way for an early creation of the new 
government. 
  Kono proposed a trilateral meeting with Murayama and 
Sakigake 
head Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary for Hata's 
predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa, for a breakthrough pact. 
  The meeting could lead to a crucial tripartite coalition to 
form the new ruling camp, political analysts said. 
  The Monday meeting between the SDP and Sakigake heads 
produced a joint call for a "dove" or soft-line government based 
on their agreed policy outline. 
  Takemura, leery of what he believes to be the high-handed 
leadership of Shinseito and Komeito in the coalition, made clear 
his party has no plan to reconcile with the group, urging 
Murayama to head the new government. 
  Meanwhile, the minority coalition, which lost its grip on 
power when Hata stepped down after only two months in office, 
played a wait-and-see strategy, turning down the SDP's overture 
for a meeting between Murayama and Hata. 
  In a meeting of the party top brass, the coalition confirmed 
its policy of waiting for the SDP's initiative for fresh talks 
on policy agreement before any high-stakes meeting between the 
party heads. 
  The SDP's policy-making board, on the other hand, endorsed 
the joint policy platform with Sakigake and called on the 
coalition to make a formal response to its proposal for the 
Murayama-Hata talks by 11 a.m. [0200 GMT] Tuesday. 
  If the coalition remains cool to the SDP's proposal, the 
Socialists will discard efforts to strike an alliance with the 
coalition and start whole-hearted negotiations with the LDP, 
insiders said. 
  Murayama underscored the possibility of an accord with the 
LDP, saying at a meeting of SDP members of the House of 
Councillors, "if there is no room for talks with the coalition, 
we should seek (another) way for creating a government." 
  Neither the SDP nor the LDP, however, is monolithic about 
forgetting their long history of bad blood and antagonism to 
join hands. 
  A group of liberals in the SDP called "Democrats" urged the 
party leadership to reject the LDP's call for alliance and start 
reconciliation talks with the coalition. 
  Within the LDP, a growing number of party members are 
tilting 
toward a partnership with the SDP, party sources said. 
  "Consensus within the party is materializing for a 
trilateral 
coalition (with the SDP and Sakigake)," said Koichi Kato, a 
senior LDP lawmaker. 
  But a group led by former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe 
made a renewed call for talks with the coalition for a possible 
new conservative alliance.

    [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in 
Japanese in its "Sunday Discussion" (Nichiyo Toron) program at 
0025 GMT on 26 June begins broadcasting a 21-minute live 
interview with Komeito (Clean Government Party) Secretary 
General Yuichi Ichikawa on Prime Minister Hata's resignation 
announcement, formation of a coalition with the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), and the future political 
situation. The program is moderated by NHK commentator Takashi 
Yamamoto at the NHK studio in Tokyo. Participating in the 
interview is commentator Naoki Tanaka. 
  Yamamoto begins the interview by asking Ichikawa: "You said 
that the coalition will step down (geya). Do you mean to say 
that Komeito will become an opposition power without trying to 
come back into power?" Ichikawa responses by explaining: "If 
there were only two major parties, or if it were a bipolar 
political world, then what I said would really mean that we will 
step down from power. However, the current political world is 
made up of three major political powers. It is tripolar 
politics. Therefore, what I meant by stepping down (geya) is 
that we have no intention of actively calling on other party 
members to form a new government or try to unify the 180 people 
who were members of the ruling parties to form some kind of 
political power." He reiterates that Prime Minister Hata made 
the decision for the cabinet to resign and to see what the 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the SDPJ will do to deal with 
the political situation. He rules out the possibility of 
holding policy meetings with the SDPJ to form a new coalition. 
He says his party will become an opposition party if the LDP 
and the SDPJ join hands to become a political power. 
  Tanaka also asks Ichikawa if his party really has no 
intention of remaining in power. Ichikawa answers: "We will not 
remain in the government by being power-mad." He adds that his 
party will cooperate with other parties or groups -- who share 
the same basic policies as Komeito, want to legislate political 
reform bills, and support the idea of not dissolving the lower 
house under the current system. Ichikawa then explains the 
policy differences on various issues, including the consumption 
tax, between his party and the SDPJ. Asked whether an agreement 
will be reached on tax reform at a policy meeting with the SDPJ, 
if they are resumed, Ichikawa says that the SDPJ flatly rejected 
our compromise proposals. 
  When asked if he thinks the current tripolar politics will 
change in the future, Ichikawa replies: "One reorganization of 
the political world will not be enough. I think reorganization 
of the political world will take place several times." "After 
all, I do not think there will be a stable government unless we 
form a majority group by surpassing the barriers of the party 
framework and joining hands with other groups whose policies are 
same as ours." 
  Going back to the tax issue, which was the major obstacle in 
coalition-SDPJ negotiations on the SDPJ's return to the 
coalition, Tanaka says there was no need to insist on setting a 
deadline for tax reform. Ichikawa explains the reason the 
coalition and the SDPJ, when they held negotiations before the 
prime minister's resignation announcement, needed to reach 
agreement on the details of tax reform before September. He 
says that the tax issue will be shelved for a long time if no 
deadline is set, because lawmakers do not want to talk about 
raising taxes before elections. 
  Asked if he thinks the LDP and the SDPJ will agree to 
cooperate with each other in winning power, Ichikawa answers: 
"They have a big policy gap. The gap between the SDPJ and the 
LDP is larger than the gap between us and the SDPJ. Also, I 
doubt that supporters of the LDP and the SDPJ will approve of 
the formation of a coalition between the two parties."

<F P=106> [Interview with Takashi Yonezawa, chairman of the ruling </F>
Democratic Socialist Party, by unidentified NHK reporter at 
Democratic Socialist Party headquarters in Tokyo -- live via 
satellite hookup; from the "NHK News" program] 
  [Text] [NHK] I will interview Chairman Yonezawa of the 
Democratic Socialist Party [DSP]. Mr. Chairman, what do you 
think of Prime Minister Hata's decision on the general 
resignation of his cabinet? 
  [Yonezawa] The opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
submited a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet shortly 
after the fiscal 1994 budget bill was enacted in the Diet. 
Meanwhile, the opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] has demanded that the Hata cabinet resign en masse. Prime 
Minister Hata has chosen the path of resigning with his cabinet 
en masse in a bid to overcome a difficult political situation. I 
would like to highly praise Prime Minister Hata's decision. To 
overcome the difficult political situation, the prime minister 
had only two options -- the dissolution of the House of 
Representatives or the general resignation of his cabinet. If 
the House of Representatives is dissolved, a political vacuum 
would be created under this difficult political situation and 
political reform would be left halfdone. I believe the prime 
minister made a last-minute choice, taking into account all 
those things. I would like to express my respect for Mr. Hata's 
decision and highly rate his decision. 
  [NHK] How do you think the next government will be formed? 
  [Yonezawa] The Hata cabinet will resign en masse. The prime 
minister decided on the general resignation of his cabinet in 
response to the LDP which has claimed the Hata cabinet deserves 
to be voted out in the Diet, and the SDPJ that has demanded that 
the Hata cabinet resign en masse. I believe that a situation 
will be created wherein all political parties discuss how to 
form a new government. I also believe that debates will be held 
on the formation of a new government and the choice of prime 
minister. Our party will watch how the political situation will 
develop in the future. 
  [NHK] Does the DSP plan to make immediate moves toward 
forming a new government? 
  [Yonezawa] Our party was subject to the no-confidence motion 
and, as a partner of the Hata government, it was asked to resign 
en masse. The Hata cabinet has just resigned en masse. Our 
party, therefore, will not make any immediate moves. We will 
watch how the political situation develops in the future.

<F P=106> [Interview with Masuo Matsuoka, secretary general of the </F>
coalition member Japan New Party, by unidentified NHK reporter 
at Japan New Party headquarters in Tokyo -- live via satellite; 
from the "NHK News" program] 
  [Text] [NHK] What do you think of the general resignation 
of the Hata cabinet? 
  [Matsuoka] I regret the Hata cabinet resigning en masse at a 
time when political reform is on the verge of completion. If the 
House of Representatives is dissolved, political reform will 
disappear. We were really worried that the Hata cabinet would be 
voted out of power in the Diet. Political reform should be 
completed, and a host of domestic and foreign issues should be 
tackled. The people do not hope for the dissolution of the 
House of Representatives and the holding of general elections. I 
would like to express my heartfelt respect for Mr. Hata's 
decision on the general resignation of his cabinet. 
  [NHK] The dissolution of the House of Representatives and 
the 
holding of general elections have been avoided. What does the 
Japan New Party [JNP] think of their avoidance? 
  [Matsuoka] As you know, political reform was initiated by 
the 
Hosokawa cabinet and the implementation of political reform has 
been a task for the JNP. If the House of Representatives were 
dissolved, political reform would disappear. The enactment of a 
bill on demarcating the current constituencies will complete the 
political reform. The JNP welcomes the prime minister's decision 
to resign with his cabinet en masse. 
  [NHK] Who do you think is desirable to be the next prime 
minister? 
  [Matsuoka] The next prime minister should continue to push 
for reforms. The next prime minister should practice politics 
for improvement of the people's livelihood and pursue clean 
politics. The next prime minister should rally political forces 
to overcome the present difficult time. This is what our party 
thinks. As a partner in the ruling coalition, our party will 
advocate the need to hold the ruling coalition parties together 
at the meeting of representatives from the ruling coalition 
parties. The ruling coalition parties have 180 seats in the 
House of Representatives, and I believe that the will of 180 
legislators cannot be ignored in running the Diet. The ruling 
coalition parties intend to unite in the future. They have 
affirmed their intentions to work together to resolve various 
problems involving the people's livelihood and push for reforms.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 26 KYODO -- Japan's largest trade union 
umbrella organization on Sunday [26 June] called for restoring 
the framework of the coalition government of former Prime 
Morihiro Hosokawa in forming a new government to replace Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata's administration. 
  The Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo) issued the 
appeal at a hastily held meeting of its five top officials. 
  The Hosokawa cabinet, which resigned in April, comprised the 
Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ -- of Japan], Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party], Komeito (Clean Government Party], the 
Japan New Party, the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), New Party 
Sakigake [Harbinger] and the now-defunct united Social 
Democratic Party. 
  The SDP withdrew from the coalition in late April in protest 
at the formation of a parliamentary group by other coalition 
partners excluding the SDP, forcing Hata to form the first 
minority government in nearly four decades. 
  Rengo is the main support base for both the SDP and the DSP. 
  In the statement, Rengo urged Hata, SDP Chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama, and if possible leaders of ruling coalition parties 
and the head of New Party Sakigake to hold a meeting to find a 
breakthrough to the political deadlock.

<F P=106> ["News Focus" by Takehiko Kajita: "Japanese Politics </F>
Rudderless After Hata's Resignation"] 
  [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- Although Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata is scheduled to exit, it is anybody's guess how 
soon he will be freed from his duties as a caretaker premier. 
  With the end of the current ordinary Diet session only two 
days away, major political parties in Japan have yet to decide 
on who should head the next government, let alone which parties 
should fashion a new administration. 
  So far, the coalition parties that constitute Hata's fragile 
minority government are adopting a wait-and-see tactic toward 
the formation of the next government as major opposition parties 
are vigorously trying to launch an administration that includes 
them. 
  The country's two largest parties, the Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social 
Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ], both in the opposition camp, 
are playing a pivotal role in livening up the intensifying power 
game triggered by Hata's announcement of his resignation with 
the two-month-old cabinet. 
  The LDP, a party that governed the nation unchallenged for 
nearly four decades until last August, is anxious to seize this 
occasion to wrest back power. The problem is the party needs a 
partner -- or partners -- to launch a new government as it lacks 
a majority force in the Diet. 
  The once-dominant party is thus wooing the SDP, the LDP's 
archrival under the LDP's 38-year rule and the largest 
contingent in the administration of former Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition government, into its fold to 
create a grand coalition government. 
  But the move has already sparked resistance from within the 
LDP because it is taken to be tantamount to the revival of the 
old political setup in which the LDP and the SDP were ostensibly 
locking horns with each other but in reality having a cozy 
relationship. 
  The tie-up with the LDP is also not easy for the SDP. While 
the left-wingers within the SDP, led by SDP Chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama, show great interest in joining forces with the LDP, 
the right- wingers headed by SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo 
favor the party's realliance with the present coalition. 
  The LDP and the SDP have also too wide a gap over key policy 
issues such as foreign policies and national security to govern 
together. It is uncertain whether New Party Sakigake, a tiny 
LDP splinter party headed by former Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura and having close ties with the SDP, can play 
cupid for the two parties. 
  As of Monday [27 June] night, the SDP leadership has yet to 
decide on which the party should choose, forming a partnership 
with the LDP or mending fences with the coalition parties, due 
to the schism between the right-wing and left-wing members of 
the party. 
  Whichever the party leadership chooses, the SDP could face a 
moment of breakup and accelerate moves toward a full-scale 
reconfiguration of political parties in Japan. 
  The ruling coalition parties are closely watching dialogue 
for the formation of a new government among the LDP, the SDP and 
Sakigake and have given the silent treatment to the SDP's call 
for the reopening of realliance talks. 
  It is widely believed that behind the coalition's attitude 
lies its conviction that the LDP and the SDP will never be able 
to get married and that the ruling alliance can certainly break 
a political impasse in its favor.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- A Bank of Japan (BOJ) 
source, commenting on a concerted market intervention in 
currency markets by major industrialized countries on Friday [24 
June], said the bank hopes the action will help normalize 
currency markets. 
  The source said the intervention shows the "resolute stance" 
of the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized countries to secure 
stabilization of foreign exchange rates. 
  The concerted action is aimed in part at sending warning 
signals to speculators, the BOJ source said. 
  The Bank of Japan expects the intervention to have maximum 
possible effect on the foreign exchange markets, the source said. 
  The G-7 nations are Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, 
Japan and the United States. 
  In addition to these countries, Spain, Belgium and other 
European countries reportedly participated in the concerted 
market intervention. 
  The action immediately lifted the dollar to about 101.80 yen 
in New York trading on Friday.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- The Group of Seven (G-7) 
summit in Naples next month is likely to discuss ways of 
stopping the U.S. dollar's decline on foreign exchange markets, 
government sources said Monday [27 June]. 
  The sources said the G-7 nations are likely to hold a 
meeting 
of finance ministers' deputies before the summit to coordinate 
their views on the issue. 
  On the Tokyo market, the U.S. dollar closed at a record 
postwar closing low of 99.93 yen on Monday after falling to a 
global low of 99.50 yen at one stage. 
  An economic declaration to be issued at the summit is now 
expected to call for coordinated intervention by the 
participating nations to stabilize the volatile foreign exchange 
market, the sources said. 
  They also said Japan is likely to face intense pressure at 
the summit to ease its monetary policy and expand its fiscal 
measures in order to promote an economic recovery. 
  A joint statement issued at a ministerial meeting of the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 
early June called for continued cooperation among member 
countries in the foreign exchange market.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted on geographical data on the 
Gulfs of Tonkin and Thailand] 
<H5>  The Hoang Sa [Paracel] and Truong Sa [Spratly] archipelagoes: </H5>
  These two archipelagoes are located in the heart of the 
Eastern Sea. Since time immemorial, they have been habitually 
called by our people the Bai Cat Vang [Golden Sand Bank], the 
Hoang Sa or Van Ly Truong Sa Island. On their ancient maps, 
Western seafarers used to describe these two archipelagoes as 
the Paracels. 
  The two archipelagoes of Hoang Sa and Truong Sa are made up 
of many islets, underwater sand banks and rock formations, and 
coral reefs. 
  On Western seafarers' ancient maps, these two archipelagoes 
are symbolized by a triangular flag, that shows they are 
situated along our country's coastline. The flag has its head 
located at the same latitude as Danang and its tail at the same 
latitude as the lower part of the Nam Bo Delta. 
  For some centuries now, due to the growth of the maritime 
sector and based on the results of many marine topographical 
surveys, these archipelagoes have been divided into two separate 
groups with Hoang Sa archipelago in the north and Truong Sa in 
the south. 
  Both the Hoang Sa and Truong Sa archipelagoes are situated 
in 
a sea area rich in natural resources -- marine life and mineral 
ores -- where there are high prospects for oil and gas 
exploitation. These two archipelagoes, which have a commanding 
view of the international sea route linking the Pacific with the 
Indian Ocean and the Atlantic, are places where strategic bases 
can be set up to control various sea routes crisscrossing the 
Eastern Sea. 
  The Hoang Sa archipelago is made up of over 30 rock islets, 
coral atolls, and sand banks stretching out into an area which 
is approximately 100 nautical miles long and 85 nautical miles 
wide. With an area of some 15,000 square km, the archipelago is 
located at 15.45-17.15 degrees north latitude and 111-113 
degrees east longitude, about 120 nautical miles from the Ly Son 
islet (also known as Cu Lao Re), 140 nautical miles from China's 
nearest island of Hainan, and 170 nautical miles from Danang.

<F P=106> [Part 2 of unattributed article: "Vietnamese Seas and </F>
Islands"] 
  [Excerpt] The Hoang Sa [Paracel] archipelago is divided 
into two groups: The eastern group is formed by several islets 
and coral atolls that rise above the sea. Of these, the Phu Lam 
and Linh Con [Lincoln] islets are the largest which, 
approximately 1.5 square km in diameter each, are covered with 
shrubs and surrounded by coral reefs and submarine rocks. The 
western group is made up of many islets, which are called the 
Croissant group because it has a horse-shoe shape and which 
includes the Hoang Sa, Huu Nhat, Quang Anh, Quang Hoa, Duy Mong, 
Chim Yen, Tri Ton, and so forth. With less than 1 square km in 
area, Hoang Sa is not the largest island on this archipelago. 
On Hoang Sa Island, now there still remain some traces of those 
facilities formerly built by the Japanese to exploit bird 
droppings and of a meteorological station which, operated by the 
Vietnamese authorities during the period 1938-1947, was 
recognized and given the codename 48-860 (The code number 48 
indicates Vietnam area) by the International Meteorological 
Organization. 
  During the reign of the Nguyen Dynasty, the Hoang Sa 
archipelago was under the jurisdiction of the Quang Ngai 
provincial city, Quang Nam province. In 1938 the archipelago was 
placed under the jurisdiction of Thua Thien Province. In 1961 it 
was reorganized into Dong Hai village under Hoa Vang district of 
Quang Nam province. In 1982 our government decided to establish 
the Hoang Sa island district under Quang Nam-Danang province. 
Taking advantage of the time when our army and people were busy 
with the overland battlefront, in 1974 China sent troops to 
seize our entire Hoang Sa archipelago. 
  The Truong Sa [Spratly] archipelago is located some 200 
nautical miles to the south of the Hoang Sa [Paracel] 
archipelago. The archipelago, which is made up of over 100 
islets, underwater sandbars, and coral reefs, stretching along a 
sea area of some 180,000 square km, is measured 325 nautical 
miles from east to west and 274 nautical miles from north to 
south and which is located at approximately 6.50-12.00 degrees 
north latitude and 111.20-117-20 degrees east longitude -- some 
240 nautical miles from Cam Ranh, 305 nautical miles from Vung 
Tau, and 595 nautical miles from the Chinese island of Hainan 
(counting from the Truong Sa islet) 
  The Truong Sa archipelago is divided into eight groups -- 
namely Song Tu, Thi Tu, Loai Ta, Nam Yet, Sinh Ton, Truong Sa, 
Tham Hiem, and Binh Nguyen -- with the Song Tu Tay islet being 
the tallest, about 4-6 meters above sea level and with Ba Dinh 
being the largest islet in the archipelago, about half a km 
wide. There are only some 20 islets [as published] in the 
archipelago with the remainder being underwater sandbars and 
coral reefs. 
  The natural conditions and the weather in this area are very 
tough. With its scarcity of fresh water and its unfertile soils 
that will not support trees, the area is frequently hit by 
scorching sunshine, strong winds, and typhoons. Many of the 
islets have no trees at all. 
  Taking advantage of the difficult situation in our country 
including those difficulties encountered in national 
reconstruction, some countries in the region have seized a 
number of islets and coral reefs of the Truong Sa archipelago, 
thus sparking a very complicated dispute with Vietnam over 
sovereignty. Presently, the Philippines occupied eight islets, 
Malaysia three, Taiwan one, and China six coral reefs. Vietnam 
has maintained its presence in and is defending 21 islets and 
coral reefs in the Truong Sa archipelago. [passage omitted on

<F P=106> [First part of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's speech at the </F>
conclusion of Ninth National Assembly's Fifth Session in Hanoi 
on 23 June -- announcer read] 
  [Text] First, on behalf of the government, I welcome the 
results of this National Assembly session with the passing of 
important laws that will have great significance and influence 
on our renovation undertaking. 
  For its part, the government will closely coordinate with 
the 
related sectors under the National Assembly Standing Committee's 
supervision to quickly promulgate the bylaws so that the newly 
adopted laws can become effective early. Together with its main 
duty, that is legislative work, the National Assembly also 
devoted time to discussing the government report on the 
implementation of socioeconomic duties in the first six months 
of 1994 and on measures to accomplish all the socioeconomic 
duties in 1994. 
  Authorized by the party and state, I recently led our 
government delegation for an official working visit to the 
Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and the Russian Federation. Therefore, I 
could not attend the National Assembly debate directly. 
However, since my return, I have received briefings on the 
debate. 
  All National Assembly deputies expressed their interest in 
the government report evaluating the socioeconomic development 
in the first six months and on major issues that need particular 
management attention in the last six months. The government is 
really taking the opinions contributed by the deputies into 
account. It considers these opinions a foundation for its 
guidelines and operations in the last six months. Now, I would 
like to further present and emphasize some issues so as to 
complete the duties for 1994 and to prepare for the following 
year: 
  1. The duty to concentrate all efforts on achieving all the 
socioeconomic targets set forth for 1994. 
  As the government has reported earlier to the National 
Assembly, 1994 plays an especially important role. This is the 
year when a new period of socioeconomic development begins in 
our country. While continuing to take care of our economic, 
social, and political stabilization, in 1994 we now enjoy the 
necessary conditions to accelerate socioeconomic development and 
settle social issues, thus creating foundation for the 
socioeconomic consolidation and the strengthening of our 
national defense and security. This can help our country 
extricate itself from the socioeconomic crisis and enter into a 
period of stabilized and firm development. 
  The tasks for the last six months of the year are very 
great. 
The report presented by Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai at 
the opening session of the National Assembly pointed out six 
types of difficult problems where concentrated efforts are 
needed for a resolution. 
  I would like to further emphasize that apart from attaining 
the various requirements for 1994, the implementation of various 
tasks in the last six months of this year will also have a great 
effect on the following year. The implementation of these tasks 
requires great effort by the various sectors and echelons from 
the central down to grass-roots levels. In the period ahead, 
the government will hold meetings with various provincial and 
city people's committees of all the three regions -- namely, the 
south, the central highlands, and the north -- to review the 
problems encountered by various regions. This is to determine 
more substantive measures with which to resolve the difficult 
issues now encountered by each region. The government will 
strive to promptly promulgate various bylaws to provide guidance 
for the enforcement of the laws already passed by the National 
Assembly at this session. At the same time, we will also 
reexamine and continue to supplement and perfect the current 
system, structure and policies. This will involve a large 
amount of difficult work. Now, I would like to move on to 
concrete issues. 
  2. The state budget, credit sources for infrastructure 
construction, and inflation. 
  Currently, the state budget, credit, and investment 
situation 
is severe. 
  A. State budget. 
  The balancing of the state budget is a pressing issue at 
present. We must execute following measures: 
  -- We must use all measures to increase state revenue. These 
measures must be based on the development of our economy. All 
policies on revenue collection must be fully implemented. We 
must fight against revenue loss and smuggling. The prices of 
some goods must be adjusted. Especially, revenues collected 
from the transfer of the rights on land usage, house sale, and 
renting of government housing must be channeled to the state 
budget. 
  -- To conform with the National Assembly resolution, the 
government has carried out the frugality plan. Now, nearly 50 
ministries and central organs and 20 provinces and cities have 
registered to practice thrift in a common effort to save 2,000 
billion dong. The government requests the remaining sectors and 
localities to quickly establish their long overdue frugality 
plan. 
  However, it is necessary to stress that the entire revenue 
and savings from all sectors and localities must be used to 
compensate overspending in the budget which had already been 
approved by the National Assembly. The money must not be used 
for other purposes. Therefore, the current mechanism for the 
handling of the state budget must be adjusted. All ministries 
and localities are only allowed to spend according to their 
approved plans. New expenditure on national defense, security, 
village and subward cadres, and on people who have rendered 
meritorious service to the nation must be kept within the 
reservation limits in their budget plans. 
  B. Infrastructure investment. 
  We need more investment to obtain a high level of economic 
development, better economic structures, and gradually carry out 
national industrialization and modernization. It is predicted 
that investment nationwide will reach about 40,000 billion dong 
in 1994. Direct foreign investment and private investment may 
reach the estimated levels, but state investment through the 
state budget and banking credit is still too little. Therefore, 
it is necessary to reexamine all infrastructure construction 
projects. If they have not completed all the building 
requirements and not ready for the construction, they should be 
canceled. For projects that are under construction, if it is 
possible, their investment should be reduced and their work 
slowed down. New projects, if possible, will also need to be 
delayed. 
  The procedure for construction, verification, payment, and 
finalization must be closely controlled. The prime minister has 
issued Decision No. 92 on the restoration of order in 
infrastructure construction and on the practice of thrift. He 
will continue to amend and perfect more documents on 
construction. It is suggested that the National Assembly 
deputies, depending on their work areas, organize, motivate, and 
check the execution of those instructions. 
  Business enterprises will be allowed to issue credit notes 
and shares and obtain foreign loans according to government 
regulations to maximize capital resources for construction, 
especially for the renewal of equipment and technology. The 
approval of the Law on the Promotion of Domestic Investment will 
certainly encourage all economic sectors to engage in more 
business and production investment from 1995. 
  C. Fight against inflation. 
  Despite no major price fluctuations in months, prices in the 
first five months of 1994 increased by six percent compared to 
the end of 1993. It is going to be difficult to keep price 
increases to less than 10 percent for the whole year as we do 
not allow the price of agricultural products to be decreased to 
avoid affecting a majority of the peasants. It is necessary to 
adjust the prices of some materials reasonably and improve the 
supply and demand relationship. Some commodities suffering from 
unbalanced supply and demand such as cement, sugar, and cotton 
will have sudden price changes if they are not handled correctly. 
  The unbalanced state budget and lack of credit sources, if 
not correctly settled, will cause inflation. Therefore, it is 
necessary to improve goods production and circulation. At the 
same time, we must be vigilant in regulating monetary 
circulation. We must balance supply and demand to keep 
inflation in single digits and avoid sudden changes to the 
prices of goods, services, gold, and U.S. dollar exchange rates.

<F P=106> [Last part of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's speech at the </F>
conclusion of the Ninth National Assembly's fifth session in 
Hanoi on 23 June -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] 3. Efforts to improve administrative procedures. 
  Recently, the Government made public Resolution No. 38 on 
improving administrative procedures a step further. The 
resolution focuses on a number of domains that cause 
inconvenience as well as loss of time and money, hurt the 
people's feelings, and lead to serious negativism. This is a 
breakthrough in the national administrative reform program. 
Therefore, the people welcome the move and hope that effective 
measures will be taken to implement it. 
  Initial research results from Hanoi Municipality and Ho Chi 
Minh City indicate that because administrative procedures pose a 
troublesome problem, citizens earnestly hope that urgent 
measures will be taken to improve them. Let me mention a number 
of examples. In Ho Chi Minh City, the establishment of a private 
business organization requires 32 types of documents and 53 
signatures and a waiting period lasting at least from six months 
to a whole year. The application for an investment permit must 
go through 13 steps and often takes two years to complete. Some 
cases even take four years. In Hanoi, motorcycle registration 
requires as many as 54 types of documents. The re-registration 
of a state business establishment under Decree 388 costs as much 
as 30 or even 100 million dong. 
  The government resolution on improving administrative 
procedures has put forth adequate measures to organize practical 
implementation. It is the government's policy to adopt urgent 
and resolute measures to achieve at all costs the goal of 
effecting a breakthrough in the working relations and ways of 
handling affairs between state agencies themselves, between 
state agencies and other units, and between state agencies and 
citizens. 
  Therefore, ministries, sectors, administrative organs at all 
levels, and state agencies are requested to carry out this 
important resolution very seriously and regard its 
implementation as a key task. Let National Assembly deputies 
contribute suggestions and see ato it that administrative organs 
at all levels, state agencies, and civil servants implement this 
resolution seriously. In cases where National Assembly deputies 
also work as managers, more serious measures should be taken to 
implement this resolution. 
  4. Order and discipline in state management. 
  To reach socioeconomic goals, one must necessarily mention 
the need for order and discipline in state management. 
Regrettably, there are indications of lack of serious order and 
discipline in state management and of deliberate attempts to act 
at variance with the law. I want to stress the most evident 
cases of failure to seriously implement regulations on fighting 
corruption, smuggling, and wasteful spending. Let me mention a 
number of examples. The government has issued very strict 
regulations on timber exports. Nonetheless, there is no 
indications that illegal timber exports have ended. A number of 
provincial people's committees has legalized hundreds of 
smuggled cars or reduced tax rates at their convenience. Other 
provincial people's committees have claimed that their cars 
should be dutyfree because they are gifts. Actually, this is 
nothing but an attempt to buy cars and resell them for a profit. 
In some provinces, customs officials have fixed motorcycle 
import fees at their convenience and collected hundreds of 
millions of dong for their agencies. Some provinces have 
granted import licenses for explosives at their convenience. 
Dozens of state-operated corporations have imported motorcycles 
before applying for licenses, and so forth. 
  It is necessary to bear in mind that whatever the motives 
and 
even if such moves are part of collective policies, heads of the 
sectors concerned and chairpersons of provincial people's 
committees must bear responsibility before the government and 
the prime minister of the government for violations against the 
law. 
  Because our legal system is not perfect, continued efforts 
are being made to supplement and develop it. It is not correct 
to say that we have no law at all. It is worth noting that 
regarding the legal system currently in effect, many sectors and 
localities still fail to comply with it in a serious manner. 
  It is necessary to stress again that heads of sectors and 
chairpersons of local people's committees must bear 
responsibility before upper echelons for the observance of law 
and for the restoration of order and discipline in the sectors 
and localities under their charge. First of all, it is 
necessary to implement very seriously regulations on finance, 
the use of capital, and expenditure. Agencies and units must 
discover corruption and smuggling cases on a voluntary basis. 
They must also inform organs of control and inspection of those 
cases so they can probe into wrongdoings and take punitive 
measures, including action specified under the criminal code. 
It is prohibited to retain cases of violations for internal 
action because such a move will lead to injustice and cause 
indignation among the masses. 
  Law enforcement agencies must step up inspection and 
supervision. This applies first of all to the inspection system. 
Immediate arrangements must be made to carry out inspection in 
the sector and locality under one's charge. It is necessary to 
achieve close coordination among agencies to ensure serious 
implementation of laws and regulations without inconveniencing 
or affecting production and business operations. 
  May I suggest that our National Assembly deputies step up 
management and supervision and, together with cadres and 
administrative organs, set a good example for other people to 
follow in observing law and in ensuring order and discipline. 
  The above is a number of tasks that I would like to stress 
one more time. May I suggest that National Assembly deputies, 
leaders of the front and mass organizations, and comrades in 
charge of sectors and administrative organs at all levels keep 
those tasks in mind and contribute to directing their 
implementation to guarantee success for our set socioeconomic 
development goals. 
  I would like to thank and wish our National Assembly 
deputies 
good health.

<F P=106> [Speech by National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh at the </F>
closing ceremony of the fifth session of the 23 June National 
Assembly in Hanoi -- recorded] 
  [Summary] "After nearly a month of active work with a high 
sense of urgency in an democratic atmosphere and with high sense 
of responsibility to the people, the National Assembly has 
successfully completed its working plan for the fifth session. 
As it had been determined that the major task for this session 
was to be legislative work, the National Assembly reserved most 
of its time and energy for the consideration and approval of 
important laws, namely: the Labor Code; the Amended Law on the 
Organization of People's Councils and People's Committees; the 
Amended law on the Election of People's Councils and People's 
Committees; the Law on the Transfer of the Right of Land Use; 
the Law on Encouraging Domestic Investment; the Law Amending 
Some Provisions of the Military Obligation Law; the Law on 
Companies; and the Law on Private Business. 
  "The National Assembly also contributed suggestions to the 
draft civil code to help the compilation agency further its work 
before the National Assembly discusses this important code in 
the next session." 
  The National Assembly chairman then explained the 
significance of the newly passed laws against the background of 
the current renovation process. He urged the government and 
agencies concerned to issue relevant documents and directives to 
administer the enforcement of the new laws. He also urged the 
National Assembly deputies, government agencies, and mass 
organizations to step up their education campaigns to help 
people better understand and observe the state laws. 
  "In this session the National Assembly also passed an 
important resolution to ratify the United Nations' 1982 
Convention on the Law of the Sea, to which we are a signatory. 
Through the ratification of the United Nations' 1982 Convention 
on the Law of the Sea, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam has 
demonstrated its determination to join with the world community 
in building a just legal order so as to encourage development 
and cooperation at sea. The SRV also affirms its sovereignty 
over various areas of internal water and territorial seas as 
well as its sovereignty and jurisdiction over areas of water 
adjoining the territorial seas, the exclusive economic zones, 
and the continental shelf of Vietnam on the basis of the 
stipulations of the convention and other principles of 
international law." 
  The National Assembly chairman also reported that during the 
session, the assembly discussed the government reports on 
various tasks, including the implementation of National Assembly 
resolutions in the first six months of 1994. He hailed the 
achievements recorded during the period, but pointed out that 
there is still a huge amount of work to do in strengthening the 
monetary system, attracting more income for the national budget, 
practicing thrift, solving unemployment, suppressing social 
vices, and so forth. 
  Concluding his speech, the National Assembly chairman urged 
people of all social strata to contribute to consolidating the 
national unity bloc by striving for excellence in their duties 
to record greater achievements in the period to come. He then 
thanked the party leaders, the government, the public media, and 
all voters for their support for the National Assembly in its 
fifth session.

  [Text] Australia says Indonesia's closure of three news 
magazines is a sign of a society in a state of transition. 
Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, says Indonesia's 
Government is having to deal with the consequences of greater 
openness. Senator Evans said Australia must take a long-term 
view and build a relationship with Indonesia which will survive 
the current generation of leaders. Senator Evans said the prime 
minister, Paul Keating, would make a judgment when he visited 
Jakarta next week on the most productive way to convey the 
strong Australian and international perception about the ban. 
  [Begin Evans recording] I think we are seeing here simply a 
society in transition, which is more focussed on its internal 
difficulties and transition processes, the move to openness -- 
the consequences of that is negative as perceived by the 
government as well as positive -- rather than a society that is, 
at the moment in this respect, paying very much attention to 
anybody externally. [sentence as heard] It's to be hoped of 
course that, particularly with an internal reaction which was 
generated, and the extent to which political openness has 
already become a mainstream part of Indonesian society rather 
than [words indistinct] go on and it would be more of a matter, 
I think, that internal reaction would produce on the ground than 
any other overt external pressure. [sentence as heard] [end 
recording]

  [Text] SYDNEY, June 26 (AFP) -- Canberra still has no 
intention of hiking official interest rates, although more banks 
are expected to increase housing loan rates amid expected 
further bond market chaos this week, Treasurer Ralph Willis said 
Sunday. 
  In a strong defence of his government's policy on interest 
rates, Willis said it would increase rates only when it saw the 
need, "which is when we see inflationary pressures emerging." 
  "We don't see that at the present time," he said in a 
television interview. 
  Willis expected other banks to follow the lead of the 
Advance 
Bank and Citibank, which announced late Friday they were 
immediately raising fixed-term home loan rates for new customers 
by 0.5 percent. 
  He said he also expected another sell-off on bond markets 
here Monday following upheaval on US markets Friday when the US 
Federal Reserve spent three billion US dollars in a failed bid 
to prop up a collapsing US dollar. 
  The sell-off here last week had been driven largely by 
events 
overseas, particularly in the United States, and he expected 
what he described as "the herd mentality" to continue here 
Monday. 
  "Now that's not reflecting any view of the bond dealers or 
the fund managers about the inflationary situation in 
Australia," the treasurer added. 
  "It is reflecting quite clearly a view about what might 
happen to prices of bonds and trying to move to ensure that they 
are not left behind if prices fall further." 
  The financial markets, he said, had "enormous influence," 
the 
consequences of which Australia had to bear in a deregulated 
market. 
  "But that does not mean to say that we are necessarily 
forced 
then into a position of raising official rates." 
  It was important to the future of the Australian economy 
that 
the government was not pushed into increasing interest rates too 
soon, he added. 
  "If we wait too long then we will probably have to have a 
larger increase than would otherwise be the case if we moved 
earlier," he said. 
  "But we don't want to move too early either because it's 
just 
pointless doing that when there are no inflationary pressures 
there to offset," he added. 
  Asked about a predicted "tidal wave" of interest rates 
increases as early as Monday, Willis said while it was hoped 
there would not be a tidal wave, other banks might follow the 
lead and raise their fixed term rates. 
  But the rates, which had been increased already, were fixed 
rate mortgages which he said were a very small part of the 
overall mortgage market and the banks had raised them to cover 
the increased cost of borrowed funds. 
  He said people should not pay too much attention to reports 
that housing loan rates could increase by two percent in 12 
months, but agreed there would be some upward movement in rates. 
  "We have been quite forthcoming about that, we have never 
denied that," he said. "It would be stupid of us to do so 
because monetary policy is an important arm of the government's 
policy for controlling inflation. 
  "Over the course of a cycle as inflationary conditions 
develop you have to use monetary and fiscal policy to keep those 
inflationary pressures at bay," he said. 
  But he described this as "a small price to pay" for 
continued 
economic recovery which would not be stymied by high inflation.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The end of the Cold War has provided Asia-Pacific 
countries with a golden opportunity to determine the future of 
the region themselves. It has also presented a scenario whereby 
they no longer need to be new pawns of the great power's chess 
board. Even this, there is no need then for the United States, 
the only remaining superpower in the world, to have a physical 
presence here. No doubt U.S. security is necessary in 
Asia-Pacific, but America can play this role in other ways. 
  As Defense Minister Datuk Sri Mohamed Najib pointed out, it 
could, for instance, take the form of technology transfer. It 
could also include defense information and access to 
state-of-the-art training. This, for instance, could help 
Malaysia in its effort to modernize its defense capabilities. 
The U.S. currently does not have a permanent military base in 
Southeast Asia. Some argue that with its drawdown of the U.S. 
forces and the breakup of the former USSR, there will be new 
powers which fill the void. It would appear in the 
international media that China is to be made up as the new 
future threat to regional security. 
  This perception is inaccurate, for China is now 
concentrating 
more on developing its much neglected economy. To China, its 
economic prosperity, which is partly tied to the region, is in 
itself a high spirit for the country. It is also currently 
involved in various dialogues, whether bilateral or 
multi-lateral, in the region. This is a good reflection of 
China's desire to be engaged in the continuous process of 
achieving regional peace and prosperity. 
  The South China Sea has often been described as the region's 
future flash point. Rather than adhering to the old mentality, 
the time has come to look to the area as an opportunity for 
cooperation, not confrontation. Most Asia-Pacific countries 
have no desire to stir the hornet's nest, but rather like to 
cooperate with each other. Therefore, the old Cold War mindset 
that the U.S. must have a permanent base here is no longer 
valid. In contrast, U.S. presence should be based on gaining 
access to facilities in the region based on the principle of 
mutual benefit. 
  There is no doubt that Asia-Pacific is one the fastest 
growing economic regions in the world. The stake for the 
maintenance of peace and regional stability is, therefore, 
economic prosperity. It is indeed a high stake for all the 
countries. As such, efforts must be geared towards ensuring the 
region remains prosperous so that peace would prevail. No doubt 
there are some security problems in the region. This is why as 
much as economic cooperation is important, it is equally 
important to establish political ties. 
  Only when a relationship is based on a comprehensive 
foundation will it be solid and able to flourish. This is what 
Asia-Pacific should strive for. Member countries have the 
capacity to turn conflicts and confrontations into peace and 
cooperation. It should no longer be influenced by outside 
powers. It is about time the region charts its own destiny.

Exposition '94 jointly sponsored by the Ministry of National 
Planning and Economic Development, Ministry of Hotels and 
Tourism, Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd and Applied 
Investment (Asia) Pte Ltd of Singapore was held at the Tatmadaw 
[Defense Services] Hall on U Wisara Road here at 3 pm today [21 
June]. 
  Present were Managing Director of the Economic Holdings Ltd 
Minister for National Planning and Economic Development Brig-Gen 
Abel, member of the Board of Directors U Myint Swe, organizer of 
the Applied Investment (Asia) Pte Ltd Mr Koh Kim Seng and 
members and local and foreign journalists headed by Managing 
Director of the News and Periodicals Enterprise U Than Maung. 
  In his address, Minister Brig-Gen Abel recalled the visit to 
Singapore of Myanmar delegation led by Secretary-1 [of the State 
Law and Order Restoration Council] Lt-Gen Khin Nyunt and work 
done on trade and investment matters between Singapore and 
Myanmar. Afterwards, a Singapore economic mission led by Prime 
Minister Go Chok Tong visited Myanmar and discussed trade and 
investment. Agreements were then signed, he said. The minister 
pointed out that Singapore is Myanmar's number one trading 
partner. Bilateral trade has increased about 20 per cent 
annually, he added. 
  The minister disclosed that there are over 100 investments 
worth 1.233 billion US dollars today. The exposition is 
organized to accelerate the process, he said. It is also aimed 
at contributing toward production, marketing and making contacts 
as well as to industries, cottage industries, production, 
construction and hotel construction. He expressed his belief 
that the two nations would further boost trade. The exposition 
is also to convince entrepreneurs, merchants and construction 
people to do business at internal level with the use of advanced 
materials. 
  Next, organizer of the Applied Investment (Asia) Pte Ltd Mr 
Koh Kim Seng said the exposition is the first of its kind in 
Myanmar and it provides a wide range of foodstuffs and 
industrial products. It is expected about 20,000 guests from 
Asia and Pacific region will visit the exposition. He also 
spoke of benefits to be gained by manufacturers and others. 
  Replying to questions asked by local and foreign 
journalists, 
it was stated that there were 91 businesses invested in Myanmar 
when Indonesian guests were briefed but there are over 100 
today. Of those, investments from Singapore amounted to 500 
million US dollars. An American manufacturing company in 
Thailand is one of the participants at the exposition. 
  The minister and local and foreign journalists viewed the 
exhibits later.

  [Text] Fighting between Burmese Government soldiers and 
soldiers of the ethnic minority groups headed by Khun Sa has 
continued unabated for seven weeks. On 23 June ethnic minority 
soldiers used a SAM-7 rocket to shoot down a Chinese-made 
government F-7 attack bomber near Mongton. The two pilots were 
killed. 
  According to a report, Burmese Government soldiers were sent 
to search for the bodies of the pilots. They engaged in an 
intense clash with ethnic minority soldiers who also tried to 
reach the downed aircraft. Regarding the fighting in Monghtaw, 
government troops lost several camps and ethnic minority 
soldiers were able to control most of the town. 
  At 1500 on 25 June, ethnic minority soldiers ambushed 
government troops who were patrolling the east bank of the 
Salween River north of Mongchut, killing seven. 
  Fighting reportedly subsided in many areas, particularly 
from 
the area opposite Muang District, Thailand's Mae Hong Son 
Province, to opposite Thailand's Chiang Dao District, and in the 
area opposite Mae Sai District and Mae Fa Luang Subdistrict. 
However, fighting around Mongchut and Monghtaw continues 
sporadically. 
  Recent heavy rains have caused many soldiers from both sides 
to contract Malaria which resulted in a lull in the fighting.

Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said the United States should not 
have made negative statements on the proposed East Asia Economic 
Caucus (EAEC) until the East Asian nations had given their views. 
  He said the United States should first listen to the views 
of 
the East Asian nations. 
  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will hold 
a meeting with East Asian countries soon to discuss the matter 
officially. 
  When all the East Asian countries have stated their views, 
then the other countries can give their comments, he said after 
receiving the Russian minister of culture, Yevgeniy Sigorov, and 
secretary general of the Libyan People's Congress on Foreign 
Affairs, Saad Mujabar [title and name as received], here Monday. 
  He said whatever proposal about EAEC now was still at ASEAN 
level and as such it was not necessary for any country outside 
East Asia to make any comment on the matter. 
  Abdullah said the U.S. should realise that EAEC was not a 
conspiracy against the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
or the U.S. 
  On the other hand, he said, EAEC would be consistent with 
APEC and would complement the efforts of APEC, while the U.S. 
was seen as a friend in which Malaysia and ASEAN had many common 
interests. 
  He said ASEAN, which groups Brunei, Indonesia, the 
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia, was holding to 
the statements made U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
and Japanese Foreign Minister Kabun Muto in Singapore last July 
that they did not oppose the proposal for the EAEC and were 
prepared to continue to discuss the matter.

  [Text] Johor Baharu, June 27 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Singapore 
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said ASEAN countries must agree on 
a position to try to explain to the United States the East Asian 
Economic Caucus (EAEC). 
  EAEC is a caucus of the Asians within APEC (Asia Pacific 
Economic Cooperation)...It is not against APEC at all, he told 
reporters after visiting the Linggiu Dam managed by Singapore's 
Public Utilities Board (PUB) in the southern Johor state Sunday. 
  Goh said Singapore has always supported the idea of EAEC and 
it would continue to do so. 
  We have been quietly lobbying the others to ask for views 
and 
it is not in conflict with APEC, he said. 
  Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed has said 
Malaysia was disappointed with U.S. opposition to EAEC and hoped 
Japan would not be influenced by its decision. 
  Asked whether there was any chance the EAEC would be 
launched 
soon, Goh said the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- 
comprising Brunei, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, 
Thailand and Malaysia -- had agreed, so it was a question of 
getting the proposed members of the EAEC to meet. 
  He said Malaysia would have to be the primary force of the 
EAEC since the idea came from Dr. Mahathir. 
  We will support. If Malaysia has some plans to ask us to 
sell the idea to the others, then Singapore would be very happy 
to do so, he said when asked whether Singapore would play a 
prominent role in setting up the caucus. 
  Last week, a KYODO NEWS AGENCY report quoted Japanese and 
ASEAN officials as saying the U.S. embassy in Tokyo had conveyed 
to the Japanese Government on June 7 Washington's opposition to 
the EAEC. 
  However, Japan said the opposition did not mean Japan would 
follow the U.S. stance.

  [Text] Malaysia has urged G-77 [Group of 77] countries to 
reject the proposal to introduce social and environmental 
clauses into the world trade. Law Minister Datuk Syed Hamid 
Albar said the attempt to introduce these clauses will undermine 
the objectives of trade liberalization and perpetuate 
protectionism. He added G-77 must remain vigilant and check 
this attempt which would be detrimental to the objectives of a 
liberalized trade regime. He was speaking at a special 
ministerial meeting of the Group of 77 in New York. The text of 
his speech was faxed today. 
  At the meeting held to commemorate G-77's 30th anniversary, 
Syed Hamid called on the joint coordinating committee involving 
the G-77 and the Nonaligned Movement to chart a common strategy. 
He said G-77 had to continue to build the bridges not only with 
groups and institutions in the South but with those outside to 
overcome the asymmetries in the international economic system. 
  In welcoming South Africa as a new member of G-77, Syed 
Hamid 
said that cooperation among developing countries was an integral 
part of the strategy to achieve economic growth. He stressed 
the problems of developing countries would not be resolved if 
they remained dependent on the international community and 
without a specific follow-up of the declarations adopted. He 
said the issue of poverty which affected one-third of the global 
population should be given priority attention in the United 
Nations agenda for development.

<F P=106> [From the "Letters" column] </F>
  [Text] I refer to the report concerning the allegation 
that the Al-Arqam movement had established a 213-man armed unit 
being trained in several places, including Bangkok (New Straits 
Times [NST], June 16). 
  I wish to inform the readers of the NST of the following: 
  Freedom of religion is guaranteed under our constitution. 
All religions are freely propagated. There is an exceptionally 
high degree of tolerance instilled in the Thai people to the 
diversity of religious practice. 
  If there are members or supporters of a religious order who 
practise their beliefs in Thailand within the law, they shall be 
entitled to all due protection. 
  As regards the Al-Arqam movement, the embassy takes note 
that 
there are still differences of opinion within Malaysia and that 
a dialogue between the two sides holding opposing views has been 
advocated. 
  On this matter, the Royal Thai Government has neither the 
policy nor the intention to interfere in the internal affairs of 
others, especially our neighbouring countries. 
  With regard to the alleged training of the armed unit in 
Thailand, there has been no clear evidence put forward by any 
party. 
  We not only would like to receive such evidence but stand 
ready to extend all necessary co-operation so that this issue 
would become transparent, thereby preventing any 
misunderstanding that may harm the cordial ties which have 
happily existed between our two countries and peoples. [signed] 
Suraphong Posayanon, 
  Ambassador, Royal Thai Embassy,

<F P=106> [Report by Abu Yamin Salam, Zubaidah Abu Bakar, and Noor </F>
Adzman Baharuddin] 
  [Text] Melaka, Wed. -- The Immigration Department has been 
instructed not to renew Al-Arqam leader Asaari Muhammad's 
passport unless he personally applies for renewal. 
  Deputy Home Minister Datuk Megat Junid Megat Ayub said 
Asaari 
should not be allowed to use a proxy to renew his passport. 
  "We want him to come personally to the department," he told 
reporters after addressing a seminar on the role of Penawar, a 
bureau in Pemadam [antidrug association] which helps families of 
dadah [drug] addicts cope with related problems. 
  Although Megat Junid declined to elaborate, he indicated 
that 
there were a few things that the Government needed to know from 
Asaari, who is believed to be in Thailand. 
  Megat Junid also instructed the Immigration Department to 
ensure that Al-Arqam sympathisers within the department do not 
renew Asaari's passport without the latter coming to the office. 
  He added that the Government was getting information on 
Al-Arqam's activities in Thailand. 
  Megat Junid said he had spoken to Thai Deputy Foreign 
Minister Dr Abdul Halim Surin [name as published] on the matter 
and the latter had given an assurance to co-operate fully with 
Malaysian officials. 
  Although many negative things have been said about the 
Al-Arqam movement, Megat Junid said appropriate action could 
only be taken with proof of wrongdoing. 
  He also believed that many people joined the movement for 
its 
religious activities and it would not be appropriate to assume 
that they were engaged in activities that threatened national 
unity. 
  "The movement has about 10,000 hardcore members but it has 
about 100,000 sympathisers. We cannot assume that these people 
are involved in the formation of its alleged Badar [Warrior] 
Army" he said. 
  Asked why Al-Arqam conducts many of its activities in 
southern Thailand, Megat Junid said: "Only Asaari can answer 
that. The movement should continue to carry out its activities 
here if they do not breach the rules." 
  In Alor Star, the Kedah Government has directed the State 
Islamic Religious Department to identify Al-Arqam members among 
civil servants. 
  State Islamic Religious Affairs Committee chairman Sheikh 
Alias Mustaffa said the department had also been asked to 
compile a list of activities conducted by Al-Arqam members here. 
  "We are aware that the movement is quite active in the 
State. 
We need to know the extent of the members' activities and 
influence on the people," he said after closing a day-long 
seminar for 600 imams [clergymen] and religious teachers here 
yesterday. 
  Sheikh Alias said the directive was in line with the 
department's move to check Al-Arqam activities. 
  In Kangar, Kedah Menteri Besar [Chief Minister] Tan Sri Dr 
Abdul Hamid Pawanteh said the State Government was monitoring 
the activities of the Al-Arqam movement and several other 
missionary groups to check deviant activities. 
  "The State Islamic Affairs Council is aware of the existence 
of religious cults in Perlis. 
  "We do not want to have any group using religion for 
self-gain or for the benefit of a certain group of people to 
exist in the State," he added. 
  Dr Hamid said the State Government needed evidence that the 
Al-Arqam had deviated from Islamic teachings before it could 
decide on what action to take. 
  Al-Arqam has a base at Titi Tinggi along the Kangar-Padang 
Besar trunk road and its followers are involved in a wide range 
of economic activities in Perlis. 
  The Islamic Centre recently alleged the Al-Arqam has 313 
armed units called the Tentera Badar [Warrior Army].

  [Text] Kota Kinabalu, June 27 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- The 
demarcation of the international boundary between Malaysia and 
Indonesia in Sabah and Sarawak (in East Malaysia), which started 
in 1975, is expected to be completed by the year 2000, Land and 
Cooperative Development Secretary-General Azmeer Rashid said 
Monday. 
  He said 98 percent or 333 km of the boundary in Sabah and 
East Kalimantan on the Indonesian side had been demarcated and 
agreed to by the two countries. 
  Work to survey and demarcate the remaining two percent or an 
estimated 50 km is expected to be completed soon, he told 
reporters in Sabah. 
  Azmeer is leading an 18-member team to the 19th meeting of 
the Malaysia/Indonesia joint committee on the demarcation of 
their international boundary while Indonesia is represented by a 
16-member team, headed by Major General H. Suryatna Subrata of 
the home affairs department. 
  For the boundary in Sarawak and West Kalimantan, Azmeer said 
only 35 percent or 1,400 km had been demarcated and agreed upon.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 27 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Non-ASEAN 
Southeast Asia can also spawn viable and active growth triangles 
(GTs) to the same level of success as those in the Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations, says Deputy Finance Minister Mustapa 
Mohamed. 
  He said that although the idea of GTs, aimed at accelerating 
sub-regional economic growth, has not progressed in these areas, 
it was a matter of time before there was greater collaboration 
and collective action with ASEAN, which groups Brunei, 
Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia. 
  Most regional trade and investment links had been chiefly 
among countries in ASEAN and North-East Asia and a lot more 
needed to be done within the non-ASEAN Southeast Asian 
countries, he said when opening the fourth Southeast Asia 
roundtable on economic development growth triangles in 
South-east Asia, organised by the Institute of Strategic and 
International Studies (ISIS) here Monday. 
  Mustapa said while ASEAN was home to some of the fastest 
growing economies, it was also home for a number of poorer 
states, thus there was a need to step up growth in the slower 
regions as the faster ones surge ahead. 
  ASEAN has, within a short span of time, seen the emergence 
of 
several successful GTs such as the Batam Triangle or Sijori 
involving Singapore, Malaysia's southern Johor state and 
Indonesia's Riau, the Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand GT (IMT-GT) as 
well as the recently agreed East-ASEAN Growth Triangle 
comprising Brunei, Kalimantan, East Malaysia and southern 
Philippines. 
  Nevertheless, Mustapa said ASEAN was heartened to see the 
few 
seed-beds of regional growth zones beginning to take more 
concrete forms such as among southern Laos, west Cambodia and 
eastern Thailand.

  [Text] Kuching (East Malaysia), June 24 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- 
The anti-palm oil campaign waged by certain quarters, especially 
in the United States, is waning in the face of counter measures 
taken by Malaysia, Palm Oil Promotions Council of Malaysia 
Chairman Dr. Ani Arope said Friday. 
  He said the U.S. was beginning to see the advantages of palm 
oil used for cooking, and the outlawing there of the no palm oil 
labelling on canned and food products had helped. 
  Five years of intensive campaign by Malaysia has begun to 
show positive results. The U.S., the biggest opponent of palm 
oil at one time, is now using a lot of palm oil, he told 
reporters after the launching of the palm oil week in this state 
capital of Sarawak. 
  Ani said there had been no new attempts to oppose the use of 
palm oil in developed countries. 
  Palm oil was poised for a golden era because it was far more 
competitive than other types of cooking oils, he said. 
  Farmers in Europe and the U.S. can only get 0.5 tonnes of 
vegetable oil per hectare of crops but we are more efficient 
because one hectare of oil palm can yield 4.5 tonnes of oil. 
  Compared with soya beans, which have to be planted every 
year, oil palm has the edge because it can last 25 years, he 
said.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said 
today that the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata will affect every country because it will drive up the 
value of the yen. Suphachai said this while in Seoul as member 
of the prime minister's delegation. He said the impact on 
Thailand might not be great because the higher value of the yen 
will benefit Thai exports to Japan. However, frequent changes 
of government in Japan could change the Japanese policy of using 
Thailand as the base for entry into Indochinese countries, 
affecting its continuity. 
  [Begin recording] [Suphachai] Regarding frequent changes of 
government in Japan, we are concerned about a couple of points. 
First, the policy of using Thailand as the gateway to Indochina 
-- to induce investment from Thailand to Indochina -- has 
already changed three times, and we are concerned about its 
continuity. Second, we, and the prime minister himself, tried on 
several occasions to schedule a visit to Japan because there 
were several issues to discuss. Our trade deficit with Japan 
now totals no less than $4 billion and Japan is a country with 
which we have a priority to solve trade problems. Our trade 
problem with Japan is just as big as with the United States. A 
visit which was postponed several times is not good for us. If 
Japanese economic growth continues as normal, opportunities for 
Thai goods will be quite good. Also, there is assistance which 
we seek from Japan on a few issues. For example, Japan is 
considering assistance in small and medium industries. There 
will be a meeting on this issue in October to organize 
assistance to our small and medium size industries, such as the 
spare part industry. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said: 
  [Begin recording] [Prasong] If the resignation of the Hata 
government is true, contacts, particularly trade and so forth, 
will not halt but the hesitation and lack of confidence over 
stability in Japan will slow down everything. Trade and 
economic cooperation will continue unaffected, but confidence 
will be affected... [interrupted by correspondent, who is 
unheard]. The LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] has been the 
government party all along. Therefore, the party will again lead 
the government. It is a matter of who will become the party 
leader. [end recording] 
  Regarding the Japanese invitation for the prime minister to 
visit in September, the foreign minister said once an invitation 
is issued it becomes a commitment for the country regardless of 
whether the government is still in power.

  [Text] Large-scale battles between Cambodian government 
troops and Khmer Rouge guerrillas will be prevented because both 
sides will be starved of military aid, the First Army Commander 
Lt Gen Chettha Thanacharo said yesterday. 
  Chettha said he believed military aid would not be 
forthcoming because that would break the 1991 Paris Peace 
Accords on Cambodia. 
  "If any country wants to give arms support, it will have to 
think twice. But I don't think that will happen and therefore 
the warring in Cambodia will come to a halt," he said. 
  Chettha said the collapse of peace talks between Phnom Penh 
and the Khmer Rouge was not a worry for Thailand. 
  However, some people might be affected if fighting spilled 
across the border into Thailand.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN on Improvement of DPRK-U.S. Relations" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 25 (KCNA) -- If the United States 
choose to improve its relations with the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea from a sincere stand, not setting unreasonable 
preconditions, we will make energetic efforts for the 
improvement of the relations between the two countries, not 
looking back on the past but looking forward to the future, 
declares NODONG SINMUN in an editorial today. 
  Noting that 44 years have passed since the United States and 
the South Korean rulers started a war of aggression against the 
DPRK on June 25, 1950, the editorial says: 
  The victory of the Korean people in the fatherland 
liberation 
war furnished ample proof that no threat and strong arm of the 
imperialists could subdue a people who rose up to defend the 
sovereignty of the country and the dignity of the nation under 
the wise leadership of the party and the leader. 
  The editorial headlined "Let Us End Confrontation and 
Division and Advance Toward Peace and Reunification" further 
says: 
  The Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK Government have in 
the past period put forward most reasonable and realistic 
proposals and programs for the improvement of the 
confrontational DPRK-U.S. and North-South relations and for a 
durable peace in the country and its peaceful reunification and 
made every possible effort for their implementation. But they 
have not borne fruits owing to the U.S. hostile policy toward 
the DPRK and the anti-peace, anti- reunification splittist 
manoeuvres of the South Korean rulers. 
  If the United States really do not want to see the 
repetition 
of the June 25 disasters on the Korean peninsula, it must 
rectify its outdated Korean policy of blindly antagonizing the 
DPRK and approaching the Korean issue from the stand of strength 
and move ahead toward the termination of the hostile relations 
between the two countries. 
  The military armistice system in Korea has been paralysed 
today by a unilateral act of the United States. The United 
States is talking much about the end of the Cold War and the 
advent of peace. Should it truly want a durable peace on the 
Korean peninsula, there would be no ground for it to refuse to 
accept the peace proposal of the DPRK to replace the Korean 
armistice agreement with a peace agreement and establish a new 
peace arrangement and there would be no problem unsolvable in 
its relations with the DPRK. 
  If the South Korean authorities want to take the road for 
the 
nation in the changed realities today, they should join in the 
nationwide cause of achieving peace of the country and its 
peaceful reunification, promoting the great unity of the nation 
from the stand of national independence. 
  MINJU CHOSON in its editorial today says. 
  If the United States do not want the repetition of the 
disasters of war on the Korean peninsula, it must bend efforts 
for a fundamental solution of the nuclear issue and a 
substantial improvement of its overall relations with the DPRK 
and respond at an early date to our proposal for the 
establishment of a new peace arrangement.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- An emergency meeting 
for peace in Korea took place in Washington on June 14. 
  The meeting was attended by representatives of some 30 
organizations and figures, including Yim Chang-yong, former 
South Korean ambassador to the United Nations, the Rev. Syngman 
Rhee, former president of the National Council of the Churches 
of Christ in the United States of America, the executive 
director of the American Committee on Korea and a representative 
of the One Korea Movement. 
  Speaking at the meeting, Yim Chang-yong called for the U.S. 
Government to hold negotiations for a fundamental solution of 
the Korean question, and the Rev. Syngman Rhee said the U.S. 
Government should explore possibilities of normalizing 
diplomatic and trade relations with North Korea. 
  An appeal adopted at the meeting contended that the nuclear 
crisis should be solved peacefully through continued dialogue 
and negotiation. The United States and North Korea should 
continue high-level talks for a solution of the nuclear crisis 
and normalization of relations, it said. 
  It stressed that in order to ease the military tension in 
Korea the U.S. Government should sign a peace agreement with 
North Korea and terminate the state of ceasefire in Korea and 
that the nuclear issue must be solved along with all other 
issues between the United States and North Korea through a 
package agreement, not by fragmentary proposals. 
  The U.S. Government should continue to explore possibilities 
of normalizing diplomatic and trade relations with North Korea, 
the appeal said, adding that the way of dialogue should be used 
in every way to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 26 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
telephoned U.S. President Bill Clinton on Sunday [26 June] to 
assure him that Japan will push ahead with ongoing bilateral 
framework trade talks, aides said. 
  "We would like to clear the way (for further progress) 
through mutual dialogue without allowing the talks to move 
backward," the outgoing Japanese leader was quoted as telling 
Clinton. 
  "I have directed working-level officials to make efforts in 
that direction," he was quoted as telling Clinton. 
  Hata also said Japan will not allow the current political 
impasse to adversely affect its reform efforts, including those 
for the election system and other political matters, economic 
issues such as market opening, and administrative reform, the 
officials said. 
  On the North Korean nuclear issue, he told Clinton there has 
been "a step forward" thanks to U.S. efforts and pledged to 
continue playing a role expected of Tokyo in close cooperation 
with Washington and Seoul. 
  The officials quoted Clinton as thanking Hata for giving 
instructions toward enhancing cooperative relations between the 
two countries. 
  The President told him Washington will continue to cooperate 
closely with Tokyo in resolving the question of Pyongyang's 
suspected nuclear arms development program, adding he wants 
progress to be made in the trade talks, the officials said. 
  Clinton said he was personally impressed by Hata's 
capability 
and personality, they added. 
  Hata made the call to Clinton's presidential retreat at Camp 
David to brief him on the prime minister's announcement Saturday 
that he is stepping down to open the way for a stable new 
government.

  [Text] Washington, June 24 KYODO -- A top White House 
official indicated Friday [24 June] the United States has no 
intention of pressing Japan for a settlement of trade disputes 
prior to the Group of Seven (G-7) Summit meeting at Naples just 
two weeks away. 
  "We have discussions going on, and there is a Naples Summit. 
Those are two interesting but unrelated events," said Robert 
Rubin, director of the White House National Economic Council. 
  Officials from the two countries have been negotiating 
almost 
continuously over the past month in an effort to mend their 
strained trade ties, which have roiled financial and currency 
markets. 
  They have expressed hope of hammering out a deal prior to 
the 
Naples Summit, which is scheduled for July 8-10. The prospect, 
however, has become murky in view of the political turmoil in 
Tokyo that has engulfed the minority government of Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  Rubin, who briefed reporters on the agenda of the G-7 
summit, 
sought to steer away from any comment on the prospect of a trade 
agreement with Japan, saying it would "not be fruitful, useful 
or productive" to comment on prospects while negotiations are in 
progress. 
  The so-called "framework" trade negotiations focus on how to 
measure progress of imports to Japan as part of a Japanese 
commitment to improve the access of foreign products in the 
Japanese market. 
  Rubin, who serves as the top economic aide to President Bill 
Clinton, also declined to make any comment on the turbulence in 
the currency markets following a sharp fall of the dollar. 
  "In our view, we should have a single person commenting (on 
exchange rates). The single person clearly should be the 
secretary of treasury," Rubin said. 
  The currency upheaval, which Clinton described as 
"puzzling," 
prompted the monetary authorities of the major industrial 
countries to launch a massive operation Friday to support the 
dollar by direct intervention in currency markets. 
  In a statement that acknowledged the concerted dollar-buying 
operation, estimated at 2-3 billion dollars, U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the turbulence in currency markets 
has become a matter of "shared concern" among monetary 
authorities in the G-7 and other developed countries. 
  Commenting on the dollar's fall during a trip to Missouri, 
Clinton said, "this is a development that is puzzling a lot of 
economists." 
  Stressing that the U.S. economy "is performing so well," 
Clinton said that "in a funny way the currency values are 
running in the opposite direction of economic strength." 
  Rubin said he expects the G-7 leaders to discuss policy 
coordination on both macro and microeconomic issues at the 
Naples Summit but declined to say whether exchange-rate issues 
will be on the agenda. 
  The Naples Summit will bring together government leaders 
from 
Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.S. and 
Russia. 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin has been invited to join the 
G-7 leaders as a "full participant" after the summit leaders 
complete the economic part of their agenda and move on to 
political issues, a senior U.S. official said.

  [Text] Washington, June 24 KYODO -- Officials from Japan 
and the United States began Friday what is expected to be a 
marathon round of talks on automobile trade issues. 
  A Japanese official said that in a "worst case scenario," 
the 
two sides would find themselves talking to each other right 
before a summit meeting Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was 
scheduled to hold with President Bill Clinton on July 8 in 
Naples. 
  In Tokyo on Saturday morning Japan time, Hata reportedly 
decided to step down together with his ministers. 
  Japanese officials say both sides have shown little 
willingness to bend on "matters of principle" involving the 
issue of how to measure progress of foreign access into the 
Japanese market, the biggest roadblock in the year-old 
"framework" trade negotiations. 
  The auto trade talks -- one of the four priority "baskets" 
in 
the framework accord the two countries concluded during last 
year's G-7 summit in Tokyo -- are intended to boost the sale of 
foreign automobiles in Japan as well as the sale of foreign auto 
parts to Japanese automakers, both in Japan and in the U.S. 
  According to Japanese officials, the U.S. negotiators are 
still insisting on what appears to be sales targets of a 
"numerical nature" for determining how successfully foreign auto 
firms are doing in Japan. 
  "This is something we cannot accept, as a matter of 
principle," a Japanese official said. 
  U.S. officials, meanwhile, could not be reached for comment. 
  Japanese officials alluded to the necessity of "political 
decision" to break the logjam, but the prospect appears unlikely 
in view of political uncertainties surrounding the minority Hata 
government. 
  The trade talks, between working-level officials from the 
two 
governments, are scheduled to grind on through the weekend. 
  On Monday, Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice minister of international 
trade and industry for international affairs, will join his U.S. 
counterpart, Undersecretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten, to 
explore the possibilities for a breakthrough. 
  Okamatsu and Garten will address "more critical issues," a 
Japanese official said. 
  Japanese officials say there is no schedule on how long the 
talks next week in Washington will last. 
  "Presumably, if the worse comes to worst, we might find 
ourselves around until right before the summit," the official 
said.

  [Text] The two-day insurance-field meeting held in Tokyo 
as part of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks ended 22 
June. In the 22 June meeting, setting of objective criteria and 
such issues as postponing deregulation on the "third sector" 
like disease and damage insurance were discussed, but no 
agreement was made as "there was considerable distance in 
positions between the two parties" (according to the Finance 
Ministry). 
  Another meeting is expected to be held in Washington next 
week. The United States is beginning to show the possibility of 
making concessions in some issues, and the next meeting is 
likely to be a final round as both nations are seeking to 
finalize negotiations by the time of the industrialized nations' 
summit in July (the Naples Summit). 
  At the latest meeting, both parties began drafting a 
document 
on what has been agreed on so far, and discussed pending issues, 
including setting objective criteria. In the criteria to 
measure the degree of market liberalization (according to the 
Finance Ministry), there was a proposal from qualitative and 
quantitative perspectives, but the Japanese delegation was not 
responsive to it. No progress appears to have been made in the 
issue of the third- sector or the question of correcting 
keiretsu-tied business practices either. The U.S. concession 
plan proposes preparing a uniform model in determining criteria 
for issuing permits for insurance businesses and urging all U.S. 
state governments to adopt this model. At present, the states 
have independent permit systems, and this has been pointed out 
by Japan as a barrier in the U.S. market. Both countries agreed 
to include this plan in the agreement document, and are now 
working on the details.

  [Text] At a 22 June session of the Committee on Foreign 
Affairs of the House of Representatives, Takashi Kosugi of the 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party asked Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa how he planned to deal with the issue of North Korea's 
past nuclear development and the stalled Japan-North Korea 
normalization talks. Answering the question, the foreign 
minister said: "Japan has not made it a condition for resuming 
the stalled Japan-North Korea normalization talks to clear up 
suspicions about North Korea's past nuclear development. It is, 
however, important to clear up suspicions about that country's 
nuclear development during the bilateral normalization talks 
before Japan and North Korea normalize their relations." In this 
way, he showed a positive position on resuming the stalled 
Japan-North Korea normalization talks. 
  During the session, Kosugi also proposed that Makoto Tanabe, 
former chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan, and 
former prime ministers be sent to North Korea for 
behind-the-scenes negotiations with North Korean officials. In 
response, Foreign Minister Kakizawa implicitly welcomed Kosugo's 
proposal, saying, "If they want to take the trouble to visit 
North Korea, we hope they will do so."

  [Text] At the lower house diplomatic committee meeting on 
22 June, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa commented on resumption 
of the 3d round of high-level U.S.-DPRK talks. Regarding the 
DPRK's suspected nuclear arms development plan, he said that 
Japan will not necessarily insist on the need to carry out 
inspections on the DPRK's application of plutonium for military 
purposes in the past. 
  So far, the foreign minister has been saying that it is 
important to find out whether or not the DPRK ever tried to 
develop nuclear weapons. On 22 June, however, Kakizawa 
commented on the U.S. Government's view, saying: "It seems that 
the U.S. Government plans, for the time being, not to force 
inspections on the DPRK over its history of nuclear reactor 
operation but to seek, at the high- level talks, complete 
implementation of [nuclear] inspections, including special 
inspections." He then said: "In this way, the suspicions over 
the DPRK's nuclear issues, including the doubts about the past, 
will be dissolved. We will ask the United States to keep our 
views in mind as it holds U.S.-DPRK talks." He made these 
comments in response to a question by Shouzou Harada (of the 
Liberal Democratic Party).

  [Text] In connection with the United States' decision to 
hold high-level talks with the DPRK, the Japanese Government 
intends to cautiously watch developments in the U.S.-DPRK talks 
for the time being. This Japanese stance is based on concerns 
that, following a possible solution of the nuclear issue between 
the United States and North Korea without Japan being consulted, 
the history of the operation of the DRPK's nuclear reactors will 
not be clarified and Japan will be asked to provide only 
economic aid to the DPRK. The government intends to seek close 
cooperation with both the United States and ROK in the future 
while trying to pave the way for resuming Japan-DPRK 
negotiations on normalizing diplomatic relations. 
  On the morning of 23 June, U.S. Secretary of State 
Christopher briefed Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa by phone on 
the U.S. decision to resume the high-level talks with the DPRK, 
before the U.S. Government's announcement of the decision. 
While Foreign Minister Kakizawa welcomed the U.S. decision, he 
made the following three requests: 1) that the "history" of the 
operation of the DPRK's nuclear facilities be thoroughly 
verified at the U.S.-DPRK talks; 2) that the United States give 
consideration to Japan's position of facing difficulties in 
assisting the DPRK's conversion of its nuclear facilities to 
light-water reactors; and 3) that the United States help Japan 
resume the Japan-DPRK negotiations on normalizing diplomatic 
relations. Secretary of State Christopher agreed to these 
requests. 
  The government's position is that "if the DPRK possesses 
nuclear weapons, if even only one, this will be a direct threat 
to Japan and that Japan cannot accept the situation," (as stated 
by a senior official at the Foreign Ministry). Meanwhile, the 
government is still doubtful as to whether United States is now 
shifting emphasis from the DPRK's "past" nuclear program to the 
prevention of "future" nuclear arms development. The government 
is eager to avoid a situation in which the nuclear issue nears a 
solution with Japan having no prospects for resuming Japan-DPRK 
negotiations, and as a result, Japan will be asked to provide 
only financial aid to the DPRK's efforts to develop its economy.

  [Text] Taku Yamazaki, former director-general of the 
Defense Agency, and Yoichi Tani, acting chairman of the 
Dietmen's League for Promotion of Friendship between Japan and 
North Korea, gave a report on their recent visit to North Korea 
at the Japan Press Club in Uchisaiwai-cho, Tokyo on 21 June. 
Both of them are dietmembers from the Liberal Democratic Party. 
  Following the talks held between former U.S. President Jimmy 
Carter and President Kim Il-song, North Korea has made positive 
moves towards holding the third round of U.S.-DPRK talks, as 
well as South-North summit talks. Touching on these moves in 
his report, Yamazaki stated his view that the DPRK is shifting 
its political stance to an open-door policy. 
  However, concerning further nuclear inspections, Dietman 
Tani said: "There will possibly be a difference in views between 
nuclear and military experts. (When we suggested that they 
should accept inspections by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency,) we got no response. It certainly is not that easy." 
Thus, he expressed his view that it will be difficult for the 
United States and the DPRK to succeed in talks.

<F P=106> [Article by Keiji Kobayashi, AERA editorial staff member: </F>
"President Kim Il-song and Secretary Kim Chong-il: Father Begins 
To Restrain His Son"] 
  [Text] In April this year, President Kim Il-song of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea invited a number of 
Western journalists to Pyongyang. It was a publicity campaign 
aimed at the outside world, personally staged by the president 
himself. To the question: "How are you going to settle the 
nuclear issue?" put by one of the guests, Ms. Mun Myong-ja, a 
Korean-American journalist, President Kim replied: 
  "So far, we have made all kinds of proposals and let them 
see 
all that has to be seen for settlement of the nuclear problem. 
In spite of this, throwing doubt on us is what matters. This 
time, the Western mass media including CNN has come to report on 
us, and I have instructed: `Let them take pictures and see all 
that they want to.' My instruction is intended to enable them 
to come to understand the realities by themselves, by letting 
many people see our situation as it is." 
  At the same time, he expressed a strong distrust of the IAEA 
(International Atomic Energy Agency) saying: "When we let them 
-- the IAEA -- see what they want to, they then say they are 
suspicious of other places and so we let them see those. Then, 
they continue to take the attitude that they are suspicious 
about still other places. They are suspicious about a military 
base, but military facilities are a different matter, having 
nothing to with IAEA inspections." 
  Ms. Mun is one of the few journalists who has been able to 
meet President Kim personally. In Tokyo on her way home, she 
gave a Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter her impression: "Though it 
may not be simple, the issue seems to be heading toward 
solution." 
<H5>  Young Leadership Feared To Have Gone Its Own Way on Nuclear </H5>
Development 
  On 13 June, less than two months after the meeting, the DPRK 
abruptly announced its intention to "withdraw from the IAEA." 
  It was made immediately before announcement of the schedule 
for the third round of high-level talks between the United 
States and the DPRK; and as the result of the DPRK's unilateral 
replacement of fuel rods without IAEA's inspectors on hand -- an 
act apparently intended to "destroy the talks." 
  The DPRK Foreign Ministry announcement of the intended 
withdrawal said: "We absolutely cannot permit any unjustifiable 
inspections, until such time we decide on whether we either 
return to or withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
(NPT)." Though the DPRK withheld the decision on whether it 
will withdraw from the NPT, most specialists conclude: "Thus it 
became impossible to verify how much plutonium the DPRK had 
extracted." There is a big discrepancy between President Kim's 
reply to the journalist and the recent DPRK decision. 
  The IAEA's presence at the scene of nuclear fuel rod 
replacements does not constitute an entry into a military 
facility; it is a routine inspection activity. Why then, did 
the DPRK refuse this at the sacrifice of the "U.S.-DPRK 
high-level talks," which the DPRK so ardently wishes to hold? 
  The first conceivable reason is to "conceal the plutonium." 
  The DPRK has insisted it processed "a very small quantity of 
plutonium" only once in 1990. 
  But, from what has been detected by satellite photographs, 
the IAEA suspects the DPRK processed a considerable amount 
(several kilograms) of plutonium when it ceased operations of 
the experimental reactor for more than one month in 1989. 
Special inspections were requested to resolve these suspicions. 
  The year 1989 marked a period during which the DPRK felt a 
sense of crisis about its own existence due to the collapse of 
communism in the Soviet Union and East Europe, in contrast to 
the Republic of Korea which was in high spirits after the 
success of the Seoul Olympics the previous year. It is highly 
conceivable that the younger generation of the DPRK leadership 
headed by Secretary Kim Chong-il ordered the processing of 
plutonium with the aim of developing nuclear weapons, without 
consulting President Kim Il-song. 
<H5>  The President Cannot Be Made a Liar </H5>
  Meanwhile, President Kim Il-song has repeatedly declared: 
"We have neither the intention nor the ability to build nuclear 
weapons." 
  If, through inspections, the processing of plutonium turns 
out to be true, the President will be made a liar, downgrading 
his international dignity; severe punishment would await those 
who had brought this about. So, it is presumed that the young 
leadership decided not to allow this to happen at any cost, thus 
deterring the inspections. 
  A businessman who recently visited Pyongyang does not deny 
this possibility, saying: "Last year's report of good harvests 
reflected a good harvest of rice in certain areas, despite the 
reports of poor crops in the substantial staple food, corn, on 
the east coast and other areas. Those close to the president 
deleted the part on poor crops in their reports, giving him the 
wrong impression that the whole country had a good crop. In 
fact, it was only a little better than the year before last, 
which was a lean year. It is said that the usual practice is 
not to inform the president of anything bad." 
  In recent days, President Kim Il-song seems to be taking 
measures to restrain Secretary Kim Chong-il's activities. 
  Late last year, the DPRK Government closed the so-called 
"Room No. 39," the office overseeing consolidated business 
enterprises [sogo kigyo] which served as a big source of income 
for Secretary Kim Chong-il; and dismissed his confidant Choe 
Su-gil, chairman of the board of directors of the Tae-song Bank, 
from the responsible position as head of the Room. The Room had 
a supralegal authority and was engaged in the amassment of 
foreign money. Powerful enterprises such as Kumsan, which had 
actually been managed by Secretary Kim's group, were put under 
the cabinet's management. It was said these measures were taken 
under the president's instructions and were intended to reform 
the economic policy which had given priority to the party and 
armed forces, and to make a good use of civilian vitality. 
  In an interview with the WASHINGTON TIMES in April, 
President 
Kim declared: "Secretary Kim's thought and guidance are 
completely identical to mine," indicating the order of 
succession was solid and firm. On the other hand, Kim Yong-ju, 
his younger brother, was appointed to the post of 
vice-president; and Kim Pyong-il, his second son, was recalled 
from his newly appointed post as ambassador to Finland. These 
actions were interpreted as signs of Kim Il- song's discontent 
with the leadership of Secretary Kim Chong-il. 
<H5>  The United States Wants To Prevent the DPRK's Withdrawal </H5>
From the NPT Another factor contributing to the DPRK's 
high-handedness is China's attitude. 
  Immediately before the announcement of the DPRK's intended 
withdrawal from the IAEA, China extended an invitation to Choe 
Kwang, the DPRK's chief of general staff. Chinese President 
Jiang Jemin met and extended him a superlative welcome address: 
"China and the DPRK are friendly neighbors with inseparable 
relations like lips and teeth." This is a complete change from 
the situation several years ago when it was said: "The DPRK is 
no longer an ally." 
  Details of the talks were not made available but they were 
presumed to have negotiated the supply of weaponry parts which 
Russia had refused; military assistance in case of 
contingencies; and the exercise of veto power when a resolution 
on economic sanctions on the DPRK was presented before the UN 
Security Council. A Chinese source in Tokyo assumed: "China has 
probably responded favorably." 
  Although tensions have mounted on the Korean peninsula as 
the 
result of the DPRK's announcement of its intended withdrawal 
from the IAEA, I do not see the danger of war breaking out as 
long as President Kim personally takes command. 
  Even though the DPRK actually processed plutonium for 
weapons 
and continues to conceal the fact, the United States looks 
likely to approve it. A U.S. expert on international affairs 
close to the Department of State who visited Japan this spring 
said: "Late last year, the Clinton administration decided on a 
DPRK policy that viewed several kilograms of plutonium in the 
DPRK as almost irrelevant to the U.S. security. What is 
important is the maintenance of the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty (NPT). So it has probably been decided that efforts have 
to be made to prevent the DPRK from quitting the NPT, with eyes 
closed to bygone facts." 
  The DPRK is letting IAEA staff members stay on to watch the 
replacement of fuel rods, despite the fact it has withdrawn from 
the IAEA. A slight chance is still left for resumption of a 
dialogue with the United States.

  [Text] A routine monthly JIJI NEWS SERVICE public opinion 
survey for June shows the Hata Cabinet approval rate at 40.7 
percent, or 0.2 percent lower than in the last survey conducted 
shortly after the cabinet set sail in May. The recent survey 
results were tallied and announced 19 June. The disapproval 
rate for the cabinet grew 7.6 points to 35.2 percent over the 
same period. Meanwhile, those who replied "I have no answer" 
decreased 7.4 percent. This means that this portion of 
respondents [who said they had no answer last month] changed 
their position to that of disapproving the cabinet. As for 
popularity for political parties, the poll showed the support 
rate for the Japan New Party fell to 1.5 percent this month. 
  The survey was conducted 10 June -- when just one month had 
passed since the Hata Cabinet started -- to 13 June with 2,000 
men and women across the country through individual interviews 
-- with 73.1 percent of them responding. 
  Immediately after the cabinet started in May, the prime 
minister announced measures to appear as the "commoners' prime 
minister"; for instance, freezing public utility charges and 
installing fax machines [in the prime minister's office] so that 
citizens can make proposals to the prime minister directly. He 
has also been on stumping tours, making speeches on the streets. 
However, the approval rate for his cabinet has not improved. 
The people's uneasiness about a minority government has 
apparently led to an increase in the disapproval rate. 
  As reasons for approving the cabinet, the largest proportion 
of the respondents, as in May, cited "because there are no other 
appropriate people." This passive reply was offered by 13.2 
percent of the respondents (as compared with 14.1 percent in 
May). This was followed by 11.8 percent (9.5 percent in May) 
who said "because he gives a good impression", and 11.1 percent 
(11.1 percent in May) who said "because we trust the prime 
minister." As reasons for disapproving the cabinet, the largest 
proportion, or 18.7 percent (16.5 percent in May), said "because 
I cannot have expectations for it," 8.8 percent (5.0 percent in 
May) said "because it lacks leadership," and 7.4 percent (3.8 
percent in May) said "because its policies are wrong." 
  In popularity of political parties, the Liberal Democratic 
Party and the Social Democratic Party of Japan gained somewhat, 
with the former receiving an approval rate of 22.6 percent (21.3 
percent in May) and the latter 7.2 percent (6.8 percent in May). 
The approval rate for Shinseito [Renewal Party] dropped to 3.4 
percent (4.6 percent in June). Approval rates for other parties 
were 3.3 percent (2.5 percent in June) for Komeito, 1.5 percent 
(2.1 percent) for the Japan New Party, 1.5 percent (1.4 percent) 
for Shinto Sakigake [New Harbinger], 1.4 percent (1.4 percent) 
for the Democratic Socialist Party, and 1.2 percent (1.4 
percent) for the Japan Communist Party.

  [Text] The opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] will hold an extraordinary session of the Central 
Executive Committee in the morning of 24 June to make a final 
coordination of intra-party opinion on whether the SDPJ should 
return to the ruling coalition or not. The SDPJ believes that if 
it decides to return to the ruling coalition as a result of a 
top-level meeting between SDPJ Chairman Murayama and Prime 
Minister Hata, the Hata cabinet would resign en masse. The 
ruling coalition parties and the SDPJ have failed to reach an 
agreement on how to reform the current tax system. The SDPJ aims 
for an early agreement with the ruling coalition parties on 
reforming the current tax system after holding the intra-party 
debate again. Some SDPJ members are still showing strong 
resistance to raising the consumption tax and it remains unclear 
if the intra-party coordination of opinion on the issue will go 
smoothly. If a situation is created wherein talks between the 
SDPJ and the ruling coalition parties run into rough sailing, 
centrists and leftists in the SDPJ, who are cautious about the 
SDPJ's return to the ruling coalition, will certainly react 
against the SDPJ's return to the ruling coalition. The SDPJ 
leadership is likely to be hard-pressed to run the party. 
  How many members of the SDPJ will vote for or abstain from 
the vote on a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet has 
become a focal point as the talks between the ruling coalition 
parties and the SDPJ have entered a final stage. Members of 
"Taiyo" [Sun], a policy study group formed by leftists in the 
SDPJ, have suggested that they would vote for the no-confidence 
motion or abstain from the vote in a backlash to the SDPJ's move 
to return to the ruling coalition. 
  Former SDPJ Secretary General Tsuruo Yamakuchi and Koken 
Nosaka, chairman of the SDPJ Diet Affairs Committee, who are 
known to be cautious about the SDPJ's return to the ruling 
coalition, met with Chairman Murayama at the Diet in the 
afternoon of 23 June to ask the latter not to make an easy 
compromise with the ruling coalition parties. Mindful of the 
moves within Sakigake [Harbinger] and the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party to back Murayama as the prime minister, they 
told Murayama, "if you are backed as a candidate for prime 
minister, you should run for the post." 
  SDPJ legislators Tadatoshi Akiba, Hideko Ito, and Seiichi 
Kaneta have issued an emergency statement opposing the SDPJ's 
unprincipled return to the ruling coalition" and handed Chairman 
Murayama the statement. Ten SDPJ legislators including Yamakuchi 
have signed the statement. There is a view within the SDPJ that 
the emerging intra- party caution about the SDPJ's return to the 
ruling coalition would heighten depending on the outcome of 
talks between the ruling coalition parties and the SDPJ, and the 
heightened caution would affect the adoption of the 
no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet in the Diet 
  Meanwhile, rightists in the SDPJ are saying that since the 
prime minister has expressed his willingness to make his cabinet 
resign en masse on the premise that the SDPJ returns to the 
ruling coalition, "there is no just cause to vote for the 
no-confidence motion."

  [Text] Diet members -- who are calling for the next 
general House of Representatives election to be held under a new 
electoral system, combining single-seat constituencies with 
proportional representation -- held a general meeting at a Tokyo 
hotel 21 June after forming a nonpartisan group "Kaikaku Rengo" 
[Reform Coalition]. A total of 218 people, including proxies 
(and 112 actual members), attended the meeting. 
  A group of Diet members who have been conducting a 
signature-collecting campaign seeking a general election under 
the new system formed "Kaikaku Rengo" to continue their 
campaign. It is comprised mainly of signers in the campaign, 
and former Health and Welfare Minister Yuji Tsushima was named a 
representative. 
  Among the "Kaikaku Rengo" policies are: 1) it will 
tenaciously oppose the attempt to take political reform back to 
the drawing board by holding a general election under the 
current multiseat system; 2) Diet reform, administrative reform, 
and economic restructuring should be promoted; and 3) political 
ethics should be established to root out political corruption. 
The group intends to ask the government and each party to 
cooperate in realizing these policies. It also intends to 
positively tackle legislation sponsored by house members. 
  The 218-member group is comprised of 31 Dietmen from the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]; 23 from the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan; 52 from Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]; 48 from 
Komeito; 26 from the Japan New Party; 14 from Sakigake 
[Harbinger Party], Group Seiun, and Minshu No Kaze; 10 from the 
Democratic Socialist Party; three from the Liberal Party; five 
from the New Party Mirai; and six independents. 
  Group Representative Tsushima held a news conference after 
the general meeting. Commenting on the connection between the 
LDP move to submit a no-confidence motion against the Hata 
Cabinet to Diet and "Kaikaku Rengo's" activities, he said: "Our 
appeal for political reform and the move toward the 
no-confidence motion are different issues." Meanwhile, he 
stressed: "The common view of `Kaikaku Rengo' members is that a 
general election should not be held unless the redistricting 
bill is enacted."

  [Text] Asked how the next government should be created, 
Watanabe, former deputy prime minister and foreign minister, of 
the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], in an interview with 
reporters at the Diet building on 25 June, stressed the need to 
create a "conservatives-conservatives alliance" -- composed of 
such conservative forces as Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and 
the LDP -- saying: "I hope a stable government will be formed 
with those who share the same views. Even if the right and left 
wingers get together, they will agree with the plan in principle 
but oppose it in practice. What we need are tolerate minds to 
iron out minor difference of opinions for the best common 
interests."

<F P=106> [Article by Masaharu Gotoda, LDP Diet member] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Concerning Japan-U.S. talks, 
product-by-product numerical quotas have been proposed by the 
United States, and it is all right to oppose them as managed 
trade. Furthermore, I don't think it admirable for the United 
States to get concessions from its trade partners by threatening 
them with possible sanctions. 
  From the U.S. standpoint, however, actual results have 
fallen 
short of expectations even after 33 negotiations in the past: 
Japan makes promises, but it fails to follow through. Then, it 
doesn't seem necessarily wrong [for the United States] to attach 
great importance to results and to refuse to accept nothing less 
if such results are not guaranteed. 
  As Japan has an annual trade surplus of 50 billion yen [Y] 
with one country, and this surplus has been increasing, more, 
there must exist something that Japan must correct on its own. 
Not even clarifying its policy to reduce its trade surplus, 
however, Japan rejects the U.S. demands totally, insisting that 
its arguments are right. Is this an adult way to maintain a 
relationship? 
  As economic problems between Japan and the United States 
affect the world economy to a significant degree, it is 
important to search for some compromise between the two nations. 
It is too foolish for Japan to dismiss completely the numerical 
quotas as managed trade without having any clear idea [of how to 
reduce its trade surplus]. 
  Also, if one proposes a national welfare tax plan, he's got 
to have a vision for a welfare system to start with, and then to 
have debates on how much of an increase in income tax he should 
be asking the public to bear, after taking into consideration 
the balance between the burden of tax and that of social 
welfare. On the contrary, he [Hosokawa] abruptly proposed a 
7-percent national welfare tax, without considering these basic 
issues. 
  Mr. Hosokawa said that the issues had been deliberated by 
the 
government's Tax Commission. But, although the Tax Commission is 
an independent council in form, it is in fact like a spokesman 
for the government -- the commission's deliberations don't seem 
to take public interests into consideration. The public cannot 
acquiesce something that they are told abruptly without prior 
discussions or visions. Restructuring of the cabinet also lacks 
a sense of inevitability and vision. If the Hosokawa cabinet 
continues to employ this kind of political method, it should 
surely receive strong criticism. 
<H5>  Unable To Control the Bureaucracy </H5>
  Not much result has been attained in the area of 
administrative reform, one of the Hosokawa cabinet's major 
policy objectives. Although deregulation and decentralization 
have been advocated, it is doubtful if there has been any 
progress in these areas. Bureaucrats seem to have become more 
influential ever since the Hosokawa cabinet came into the scene, 
failing to control the rise of the bureaucracy. 
  For example, the national welfare tax plan mentioned earlier 
can also be considered as a measure to secure the source of 
funds at the time of income tax reduction. To be sure, as the 
Ministry of Finance [MOF] argues, it is impossible to reduce 
taxes without having another source of funds. Here, I think we 
need to acknowledge this argument, for it has its own ground. 
But, to reduce income tax by 6 trillion yen or so, they are 
trying to increase taxes by approximately 9 trillion yen in 
total, including 2.4 trillion yen from a 1-percent increase in 
consumption tax. I can understand this as the logic of the 
bureaucracy, but the public won't accept it. 
  I guess the Hosokawa cabinet didn't realize the difficulty 
of 
tax reform. Things are not that easy. If they [the cabinet] 
wanted to reduce income tax as part of their economic stimulus 
package, they should have dealt with it separately from the 
increase in consumption tax. 
  In any event, if the bureaucracy tries to bring up a 
self-serving logic, somebody has to contain it; being able to do 
so is the true ability of a politician. The Hosokawa cabinet, 
however, didn't have this ability. 
  How, then, can the cabinet order the bureaucracy to delegate 
more power to local governments, or to loosen up regulations? At 
present, 82 items of deregulation are on the list. But, how many 
of these have real substance? 
  Now, how about the progress on reform of the economic 
system, 
another important agenda for Japan? This is also a difficult 
task. The Japanese economy today is not at a stage where a few 
improvement measures would suffice. Rather, it is at a stage 
where we need to plunge a scalpel into the very system of the 
economy. Japan will be looked upon by foreign countries as a 
disturbing factor for the world economy if it continues its 
economic activities based on the ideas of mass production, mass 
merchandising, and mass market share. If Japan continues to 
record a one-sided trade surplus, the world economy will not be 
able to sustain itself. 
  How to reduce a surplus, or how to utilize the surpluses 
accumulated within the nation in order to improve the lives of 
citizens -- if an overall plan based on this kind of questioning 
doesn't exist, economic plans themselves won't develop. What Mr. 
Hosokawa has come up with so far are makeshift measures to 
stimulate the economy. I believe he should increase the budget 
for public works projects from the planned amount of 430 
trillion yen. 
  Although reform of our election system is said to have 
gained 
a firm footing, it is just a small step toward political reform. 
Redrawing voting districts, preventing corruptions, and so on -- 
all this being considered, we are still somewhere between 20 and 
30 percent of the height of the mountain to climb. [passage 
omitted] 
<H5>  Responsibility Also Lies With the Antireformist LDP </H5>
  Yet, the support ratings for the cabinet are still 
inexplicably high. Although they declined somewhat to 50 
percent, compared to 70 percent around the time when the new 
government was installed. But, they are still high. Frankly, I 
think they show the flip side of the public dissatisfaction over 
many years of Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] reign. 
Responsibility lies with our party, because even though the 
support ratings for the Hosokawa cabinet declined, those for the 
LDP haven't improved. 
  A political party that is or will be in charge of the 
government must maintain support ratings of 50 percent or so all 
the time. The LDP in the old days did so. But, the party is now 
one-fourth the size it used to be, receiving support ratings of 
around 25 percent. 
  Once the coalition government is considered ineffective, the 
LDP with its rich experience and human resources ought to regain 
public confidence. But it hasn't. As it didn't carry out 
self-reform for its rebirth, it has been unable to erase the 
disappointment [felt by the public]. People are disappointed 
with the coalition government and remain disappointed with the 
LDP. I believe this is a crisis situation for Japanese politics 
that has never before been experienced. Therefore, the most 
important thing for the LDP to do now is to reform the party to 
be reborn. 
  The LDP must clarify its ideas on how to deal with new types 
of changes here and abroad and how to cleanse itself of various 
stains it accumulated over the years. This unfinished business 
is the agenda for party President Kono. 
  The reason I recommended Mr. Yohei Kono for the party 
presidency is that I believed he would be the person to enable 
the party to win the next election and regain its political 
power. But Mr. Kono is now fettered by complex movements within 
the party so that he is unable to flex his muscles. Unless he 
overcomes this, the LDP will not be able to regain public 
confidence or to win the election. Because he is not a head of 
any faction, he cannot use the tactics of cooperating with other 
factions, unable to exercise his leadership. 
  The current situation is still transitional, and although 
the 
factions within the party are on their way to disintegration, we 
still have to use these factions to get things done. We must 
find our way out from this situation and organize ourselves 
around the party apparatus. Yet, we haven't come to this point, 
and therefore I believe President Kono is having a rough time. 
We should not be distracted by various movements in the leading 
coalition parties and within our party. Regrettably, however, 
everyone seems to be vacillating. 
<H5>  Need To Strengthen Anticorruption Measures </H5>
  Four related bills have been passed, and we are on the 
threshold of political reform. As stated earlier, I want to rate 
highly the Hosokawa administration's efforts to accomplish this 
much. 
  However, the recent revision of law is a means toward 
reform, 
not the end. The fundamental goal is to activate parliamentary 
democracy. In other words, having two opposing major political 
powers and thus maintaining political tension, we will 
occasionally have a change of administration. By creating this 
kind of political system, the two parties will try to solve 
political problems responsibly for the public. This is how the 
system should be. 
  For example, we need to further strengthen anticorruption 
measures. The case of general contractors' bribery of Mr. 
Kishiro Nakamura is currently being tried. But, it contains some 
difficult legal issues. I don't know how the trial will develop, 
but I think it natural for the public, whose annual income is 
around 6 million yen to 7 million yen, to give a harsh look at 
the political world, where a single voice can mobilize 10 
million yen. The public certainly thinks that money moves 
politics. 
  As anticorruption measures that would lessen any further 
public distrust in politics, we need to strengthen the 
regulation holding a candidate jointly responsible for election 
fraud and to expedite trials for election law violations. A 
trial in Japan takes too long. I don't understand why no one has 
suggested reform in this area. Also, there is room for 
improvement in how political contributions by corporations 
should be made. 
  However, as Japan is a corporate society, it has no 
tradition 
of contributions by individuals. Nevertheless, there is a 
riskier side to individual contributions. In some instances, I 
ask my secretary to return such individual contributions, 
because I don't know if they are pure political contributions or 
if they accompany some ulterior motives. 
  Even if corporate contributions are banned, there will 
always 
be some loopholes. Although individual contributions are the 
norm in the United States, corporations are actually making 
contributions to particular politicians through political action 
committees. For example, a corporation pays extra wages to its 
employees, and then makes the employees contribute the extra 
amount in their names. As such contributions are made for the 
benefit of the stockholders to politicians who have some 
business-related political clout, they are definitely considered 
as a bribe in Japan. Judging from this, anticorruption measures, 
however strict they may be, have some loopholes. Therefore, the 
issue rests on the attitude of each individual politician. 
  Still, we need to plug obvious loopholes and to create a law 
that will make it difficult to find loopholes. The issue of [how 
to apportion] voting districts still remains, as does reform of 
the upper house and the electoral system for local assemblies. 
As stated earlier, if the Hosokawa cabinet thinks that political 
reform is already complete, I would say that's gross ignorance. 
<H5>  Doubt About Komeito's Participation in the Government </H5>
  How will the political situation develop from now on? The 
key 
to this question is when the next election for the lower house 
will take place. Will it take place at the end of this year, or 
next year? If the Diet is dissolved before then, the election 
will be conducted according to the existing system. Considering 
the significance of having reformed the electoral system, it 
seems reasonable to employ the new system in the next election. 
  How will each party carry out its election campaign 
according 
to the new system? As it is a single-seat electoral system 
combined with some proportional representation, the new system 
will generate complex actions on the part of individual 
politicians vying for nomination in particular districts or 
trying to obtain candidacy in a block for proportional 
representation. At the same time, there will also be some 
breakups and mergers among political parties. 
  It is difficult to make a clear and accurate prediction of a 
convergence [of parties] at this point in time. But, if I 
venture to guess, I think there will remain at the end about 
three political powers plus the Japanese Communist Party [JCP]. 
The ideal situation is to have two major parties. But, some 
additional parties tend to appear in the middle, as in England 
and Germany. 
  In the case of Japan, I don't know if a party in the middle 
will be a small one as in England and Germany. It is possible to 
have a situation where the party in the middle has the largest 
power and the other parties on both ends of the spectrum are 
small. In any event, the middle party always tends to belong to 
the leading party. 
  I can't make a definite statement, but I believe that 
Sakigake [Harbinger] and the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] without the extreme left wing will join together. 
Although the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] is a bit different 
from these two parties, it is highly likely that it may join 
them, considering its relationship with the Japanese Private 
Sector Trade Union Confederation. Adding to this a conservative 
power centered on the LDP and another conservative power on 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], therefore, it is possible to 
see three power centers. 
  Komeito and the JCP are alike in a sense, and their 
participation in political administration will be strongly 
resisted, I believe. They share the same kind of character, if 
somebody orders the others to turn right, everybody turns right, 
and everybody tends to say the same thing. Komeito has Mr. 
Takeiri and Mr. Yano, both of whom are nice people to talk with 
on a personal level. But, looking at it as a political party, 
there are many problems. 
  Recently, Komeito has been saying that it doesn't mind 
dissolving itself. Making its origin ambiguous by doing so can 
be a strategy to gain influence on one of the conservative 
powers. This may not work, however, because a candidate 
supported by the Soka Gakkai [Komeito's major support base] 
tends to lose votes from constituents of other parties. I think 
many people see it as problematic to have this kind of candidate 
participate in the administration. 
<H5>  True Motives Behind the Alliance Between the Japan New Party </H5>
and Shinseito 
  Realignment centering on the idea of combining the Japan New 
Party and Shinseito is currently underway within the leading 
coalition parties. Stating my conclusion first, I believe 
breakups and mergers of political parties will continue until 
the end of this century. There remain only seven years or so in 
this century; that means there will be only two or three general 
elections. The realignment currently underway is aimed at the 
next election. After the election, another realignment will take 
place for gaining power, based on the number of seats each party 
wins. 
  The Japan New Party is like a reformist group among the 
conservatives. By nature, therefore, it should associate itself 
with Sakigake. On the other hand, Shinseito is a group formed by 
the people from the LDP's Takeshita faction, and Komeito is a 
party based on religion -- they are different in character. So, 
it is difficult to understand when the Japan New Party acts in 
concert with Shinseito and Komeito, rather than with Sakigake. 
  Nonetheless, the Japan New Party tries to cooperate with 
Shinseito. It does so to maintain its political power. Putting 
myself in Mr. Hosokawa's shoes, I think he wants to maintain his 
political power for even a day longer. From Mr. Ozawa's 
standpoint, he wants to build a larger power base than the LDP 
for the next election. The cooperation is based on nothing but 
these motives. 
  As far as Takemura is concerned, he seems to have spoken too 
much as a cabinet secretary during the upheavals relating to the 
National Welfare Tax and restructuring of the cabinet. But he is 
a rare politician. He holds up an ideal in his political 
activities and keeps chasing after the ideal. But he doesn't get 
discouraged when he can't reach that ideal; he has a practical 
side, too. In this sense, he is different from ordinary 
politicians. 
  Hosokawa and Takemura share the same national sentiment. 
Therefore, the Japan New Party was supposed to ally itself with 
Sakigake. But, Hosokawa allies himself with Ozawa. Here lies the 
difficulty of realignment. 
<H5>  Opposing Ozawa's Theory of the Nation </H5>
  Then, how does the national sentiment of Mr. Hosokawa and 
Mr. 
Takemura differ from that of Mr. Ozawa? 
  Ozawa says that Japan should become a "normal nation." 
Behind 
this thought is an assumption that Japan today is abnormal. 
  In today's international community, it is not normal for 
Japan to pursue only economic activities without carrying out 
its international responsibility; if requested by the United 
Nations, Japan should use its armed forces abroad; if necessary, 
we should revise our Constitution; and if you don't want to 
revise the Constitution, we should interpret it in broader 
terms, say, Japan can do such and such to some extent so as to 
be a normal nation. This is Ozawa's view. I think Ozawa has his 
own political philosophy, and that he is a politician with 
strong power of execution -- he has his own point of view. 
  But, Takemura has a different view. I do, too, and so does 
Hosokawa, I believe. 
  What will it be like if Japan uses its armed forces abroad 
in 
this violently changing international situation by going beyond 
the line it has kept up until now? Considering its current 
economic power, I see a risk that Japan may turn to 
supernationalism and hegemonic ambitions, moving on to the 
strengthening of its military power. Then, what will happen to 
Japan? The United States may welcome this as long as Japan is 
under its control. But, Japan may become isolated in Asia. 
  For example, the United States and China are now in conflict 
over the human rights issue. But once they find a mutual 
interest, they will join together readily. 
  On the other hand, if Japan starts building up its armaments 
and entertains its hegemonic ambitions, its relationship with 
China will break down decisively, and the situation in Asia will 
become tense immediately. 
  Therefore, I can't agree with the idea of Japan becoming a 
normal nation. As natural rights as an independent nation, Japan 
should have some military capability for its citizens to defend 
themselves from foreign aggressions. Also, since nuclear weapons 
exist in the world, it is all right as an option for Japan to 
remain under the U.S. nuclear umbrella pursuant to the 
Japan-U.S. Security Treaty so as to defend its citizens from 
nuclear attack. 
  In any event, Japan should keep its principle of not using 
military forces abroad. Instead of using military forces, Japan 
should make positive contributions to the international 
community in the areas of peace and public welfare. I don't 
believe the use of military forces is the only way to contribute 
to the international community. 
  The world is moving away at least from confrontation among 
nuclear powers to a global society where nuclear weapons are 
unnecessary. Regional conflicts may remain, but the world as a 
whole is moving toward peace. What kinds of needs and meanings 
are there for Japan to strengthen its military power and to 
entertain hegemonic ambitions under the name of the United 
Nations, pursuing a super power status along with the United 
States? 
  Tribal conflicts and religious disputes are going on in 
various parts of the world. It will not be known for the next 
five to 10 years how the world will come to rest. In these 
circumstances, how can we be so foolish to divide public opinion 
into two on the issue of our Constitution? It would be all right 
to debate this issue five or 10 years from now, but I don't 
think we should have a political showdown that would divide 
public opinion at this time.

  [Text] Despite market interventions by currency 
authorities from Japan, Europe, and the United States, the 
dollar's value continued to drop against the yen and the 
Deutsche mark. As a result, the government and the Bank of 
Japan [BOJ] are ready to intervene in the market, beginning 27 
June, if the yen's appreciation continues, by selling the yen 
[Y] and buying the dollar at the Tokyo foreign exchange market. 
The government and the BOJ are worried the rapid rise in the 
yen's value may reduce profits from export-oriented industries 
and have negative impacts on the domestic economy, which is 
beginning to recover. While there is a rumor the United States 
may increase its interest rate, it is likely Japan will study 
the possibility of acting in harmony with the United States in 
the financial policy field by introducing such measures as 
keeping short-term interest rates low. 
  Joint market interventions on 24 June did not have enough 
effect because speculators, including U.S.-affiliated companies, 
sold the dollars they had at a scale exceeding the amount of 
money Japan and the United States spent in the market 
interventions. After the dollar-yen rate dropped to the Y99 
level at the New York market on 21 June, the BOJ launched a 
major intervention in the Tokyo market and pushed the dollar 
back to the Y101 level. Therefore, the BOJ still has confidence 
in market intervention. 
  However, due to the huge surplus in Japan's current account 
balance, investors have a strong feeling there are surplus 
dollar funds at the Tokyo foreign exchange market. Moreover, on 
24 June, President Clinton criticized Japan for its trade 
surplus. Therefore, the government and the BOJ are worried about 
the possibility that pressure, which calls for further 
appreciation of the yen, may become strong in the money markets 
after 27 June. 
  When the dollar's value dropped in May, there were some 
movements in the financial field to push it up. The BOJ 
increased its funds supply in the short-term financial market 
because an increase in funds supply is expected to widen 
differences in interest rates between Japan and the United 
States and thereby increase demands for the dollar. It is 
possible the BOJ may be forced to introduce such a financial 
measure if the recent interventions in the Tokyo market fails to 
produce results. 
  The government plans to promote measures, including 
deregulation, and plans to review as much as possible, 
fundamental public investment plans in accordance with an 
initial schedule to show its stance at home and abroad that it 
aims at realizing economic recovery, led mainly by domestic 
demands that exist even after the cabinet's resignation. 
Moreover, the government also wants to make some progress in 
Japan-U.S. comprehensive economic talks before the developed 
countries' summit meeting (Naples summit) to improve Japan-U.S. 
relations.

  [Text] At a news conference after a 24 June cabinet 
meeting, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai commented on 
the yen's rebound on New York Foreign Exchange Market, saying: 
"Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii has also repeatedly said the 
government will deal with currency movements with a resolute 
attitude. We will maintain this attitude while considering a 
concerted intervention with other countries." He thus indicated 
a strong possibility of a concerted dollar-buying intervention 
in currency markets with the United States and European 
countries.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Strong Yen Is Distorted Reflection of the </F>
Economy"] 
  [Text] The dollar temporarily dropped to 99-yen [Y] in 
European and U.S. markets and the "era of one dollar equals to 
less than Y100" has arrived. Although the dollar dropped to the 
Y100 level last August, significance of breaking the 
psychological barrier is not small. 
  The yen-dollar exchange rate, which started at Y360 to the 
dollar when Japan was in ruins after World War II, finally 
dropped to lower than the Y100 level after going through the 
Nixon shock, shift to a floating exchange rate system, Plaza 
agreement, and other changes. Since yen's exchange rate reflects 
Japan's competitive power, some people may take pride in the 
rapid rise in yen's value. 
  However, we are certain that many businessmen have no reason 
to take pride. Such a high exchange rate, if it takes root, 
will shrink export companies' revenues and will have an effect 
of retarding the economic recovery, which is about to bottom out 
at long last. 
  A rapid rise in yen's value lowers stock prices and hampers 
financial organizations' efforts to deal with bad debts. The 
issue of bad debts may come up to the surface again and 
undermine the financial system. 
  We cannot rule out the possibility of industrial stagnation 
either. Following the rise in yen's value last year, quantity 
of imported goods has increased rapidly. On the other hand, 
companies, which produced goods for export, are quickly moving 
abroad. 
  While major domestic auto makers are being forced to shut 
down some of their plants, foreign auto sale in Japan is rapidly 
expanding. The market share of foreign cars reached 8.6 percent 
in May. It is possible that some 30 percent of new cars sold in 
Japan may be foreign cars and the Japanese auto market may 
become like that of the United States in the near future. 
  It is quite natural that amount of import increases and the 
industrial relocation overseas progresses as the economy grows. 
The only thing we can do to make up for such a 
deindustrialization is to create new jobs. 
  In the case of Japan, however, we should not forget the fact 
that our economic structure is distorted. Due to government 
regulations and traditional business practices, prices of 
imported goods do not go down enough. Export industries do not 
hesitate to export goods without making profit just to keep 
their employees. Because of these, the yen's exchange rate 
tends to rise higher than its actual value and thereby forces 
industries, which can remain in Japan, to move abroad. 
  Despite the Bank of Japan's intervention in Tokyo market on 
22 June, the yen's exchange rate against the dollar reached the 
highest in the postwar era. The government is trying to lower 
the yen's value through coordinated intervention with other 
industrial nations in foreign exchange markets. However, it is 
said that the United States is skeptical about the effect of 
such cooperation. Market intervention may temporarily stop the 
trend of money market but it cannot change it. 
  The government should exert more efforts to correct causes 
of 
the excessively high value of the yen. It publicly promised 
that it would map out economic measures, centered around the 
idea of increasing public investments and easing regulations, by 
the end of this month. It has no choice but to firmly promote 
the process of deregulation to correct the distortion of the 
current economy. 
  The dollar dipped below Y100 following the fall of its value 
against European currencies. The weak dollar against major 
currencies is the cause of strong yen. 
  Funds, which change hands from one country to another by 
seeking profit, grew big. It is said that money, which amounts 
to $1 trillion, was invested in British pound and Italian lira 
at the time of the 1992 European currency crisis. 
  Due to concerns about the future of U.S. economy, this money 
has begun to change hands from dollars to other currencies. For 
fear of possible inflation in the United States and huge amount 
of its deficit in the current account balance, the money is now 
being invested in the yen and European currencies. 
  The dollar's further decline will not be beneficial to the 
United States either. However, further interest rate hike may 
create a crash like the Black Monday. The United States is also 
in a difficult situation. 
  There is no remedy for the U.S. economy. It seems that the 
only things the United States can do to emerge out of the 
difficult situation is to steadily reduce its financial deficit 
and to increase its savings rate.

  [Text] On 24 June, the Federation of Economic 
Organizations of Japan [Keidanren] (chairman Shoichiro Toyoda) 
decided to urge the government to include the complete abolition 
of 70 economic regulations, which was suggested in an interim 
report worked out by the Economic Reform Study Council (the 
Hiraiwa Council), in the five-year program for promoting 
deregulation (action program) to be formulated by the end of 
this fiscal year. 
  The 70 regulations are: 19 regulations on participation in 
business operations, such as liquor production and sales; nine 
regulations on facilities requirements, including the Large 
Retail Store Law; 23 trade regulations, such as the state trade 
items; and 19 price regulations, such as government purchase 
prices for rice and wheat. Keidanren also demands the five-year 
plan include a schedule for reducing regulations by half in five 
years, at the longest, and completely abolishing them after 10 
years.

  [Text] The government is committed to mapping out a set of 
external economic measures by the end of June, and a centerpiece 
of the package of external economic measures is a package of 
deregulatory measures. Six cabinet ministers, including Koshiro 
Ishida, director general of the Management and Coordination 
Agency; Eijiro Hata, minister of international trade and 
industry; Mutsuki Kato, minister of agriculture, forestry and 
fisheries; and Hiroshi Fujii, minister of finance, met at the 
Diet building on 22 June to discuss ways to map out the package 
of deregulatory measures. During the meeting, Director General 
Ishida stressed the need to boldly relax the current 
regulations, but other cabinet ministers said only that the 
package of deregulatory measures can be mapped out on the basis 
of deregulatory measures that are incorporated in the budget 
bill and other deregulatory measures that are included in 
council recommendations. As a result, the meeting failed to 
produce any tangible results. 
  The government has mapped out a package of deregulatory 
measures covering about 200 areas. The government, however, 
intends to increase the number of areas to be deregulated by 
urging each cabinet minister to make political decisions. The 
government plans to make a final decision on the package of 
deregulatory measures at a cabinet meeting on 29 June. 
  Director General Ishida reported the results of the meeting 
to Prime Minister Hata at the end of the meeting. Upon 
receiving the report, the prime minister emphasized the need to 
flesh out the package of deregulatory measures, saying: "It is 
important to flesh out the package of deregulatory measures. I 
hope that each ministry and agency will work to increase the 
number of areas to be deregulated."

  [Text] Details of a deregulation plan which the Ministry 
of Transport [MOT] will newly implement have been revealed. In 
connection with the issue of standards and certification for 
automobiles, which is a focal point of the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks, the MOT will improve the system of accepting 
international standards and data on foreign inspections. The 
27- item deregulation plan also includes: 1) flexible 
management of freight railway fares and warehouse charges; and 
2) expansion of business areas for trucks. The plan will be 
incorporated into a deregulation package to be compiled by the 
government at the end of June. The MOT will not introduce the 
price ceiling system (price cap system) for railway fares, 
saying "there are still many problems" in the system. The 
introduction of the system has been demanded by JR [Japan 
Railway Company] and the Administrative Reform Headquarters' 
working group on imports promotion, market access improvement, 
and distribution.

  [Text] On 24 June, the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI] began studying concrete import restraint 
measures to be implemented when foreign products flood into 
Japanese markets. On the same day, the ministry held the first 
meeting of the Export-Import Transaction Council (an advisory 
panel to the international trade and industry minister). It 
plans to work out conclusion in time for discussions on the 
ratification of the World Trade Organization (WTO) treaty 
scheduled for September. 
  The Finance Ministry has also begun the study of import 
restraint measures at the Customs Tariff Council (an advisory 
body to the finance minister). The two ministries will work in 
closer cooperation through their councils to work out 
"Japanese-style import restraint" measures. 
  The WTO treaty, which was signed in April following the 
conclusion of the Uruguay Round of talks, authorizes a country 
to restrain imports as an emergency measure by such means as 
raising tariffs when a low-priced product is imported in large 
quantities. Although Japan has a system of imposing retaliatory 
tariffs or volume restraint, it seldom implements these measures 
because it takes a lot of time to do so in actuality. 
  The WTO treaty approves of retaliatory measures when the 
treaty is violated. For example, if a textile product is 
imported in violation of the treaty, taking retaliatory measures 
against another product, like automobiles, is possible under the 
treaty. However, Japan has not yet decided on concrete 
retaliatory measures. 
  Thus, the two councils will discuss what kind of retaliatory 
measures should be adopted. 
  They plan to review the Customs Tariff Law and the Foreign 
Exchange Control Law, if necessary.

  [Text] Economic Planning Agency [EPA] Director-General 
Terasawa announced on 24 June that a research group has been 
established within the Agency to analyze the economic effects of 
coming deregulation. The research group will calculate expected 
economic growth and effects of deregulations in such areas as 
the information and communications business, including possible 
effects resulting from the review of the Large-Scale Retail 
Stores Law. The EPA will make the results of the research 
available to the public with aim of helping to promote 
deregulation. EPA Director-General Terasawa said "the research 
report should be worked out at an early date; otherwise, it will 
be meaningless. We will work out the report in two or three 
months at latest." 
  The reseach activity will be carried out by "Rakuichi-Rakuza 
Research Group" (with Takezo Ishikawa, Mitsui Marine and Fire 
Insurance Co., Ltd chairman, as its head]. The group held its 
first meeting on the afternoon of 24 June. As the first step, 
the group plans to study possible effects of the government's 
deregulation measures to be hammered out in late June, with 
emphasis on the areas of housing, information, and distribution.

Digitized Information Database, which translates and summarizes 
in English Japanese press reports related to Japan's 
scientific/technical industries. This material will also be 
carried in the FBIS publication JAPAN SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY. 
  NEC has developed a dry etching technique which will be 
usable in 1Gbit DRAM production. The company proved in an 
experiment that raising the percentage of carbon monoxide gas 
mixed in etching gas helps increase selectivity. It has also 
discovered that the higher the carbon content of fluorocarbon 
film, the more resistant the film is against etching gas ion 
emission. NEC thinks the technique will be practical enough to 
form contact holes as small as 0.25 micron. (Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO 
SHIMBUN 26 May 94) 
  Toshiba, IBM, and Siemens have agreed to jointly develop a 
second- generation 64Mbit DRAM chip. The three companies, which 
are cooperatively working on a 256Mbit DRAM, will combine their 
respective 64Mbit DRAM technologies with 256Mbit DRAM 
technologies under development in order to develop the 
second-generation chip. To be designed using a 0.35-micron 
process, the second-generation chip will be about 20% 
smaller 
than the first-generation chips. Joint development focus will be 
on circuit design, processing, and ion implantation techniques, 
and joint efforts will be carried out at IBM's research centers 
in New York, where the three firms will assign a maximum of 50 
engineers. Toshiba, which has already developed a 
first-generation 64Mbit chip using a 0.4-micron process, plans 
to launch volume production two to three years from now. (Tokyo

  JEOL has set up a dedicated team to develop a 
fully-automated 
photomask/wafer defect inspection/repair system. The 10-member 
team plans to develop a commercial system in 1996. The team will 
add functions for locally depositing and repairing silicon and 
metal film as well as automation functions to an ultra-fine 
processing evaluation system the company launched in 1992. JEOL 
will target the 64Mbit or larger LSI production and phase-shift 
photomask production processes. (Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO 26 May 
94) 
  Toyo Information Systems (TIS) plans to launch a frame relay 
service on June 1 for high-speed transmission of large-volume 
data. The company has set up access points in Tokyo and Osaka, 
and plans to increase the number of access points depending on 
future demand. The service will cover an area within a radius of 
15km from each access point, and another access point will be 
set up in Nagoya in the fall. TIS will use NCR frame relay 
switches, and aims to gain 10-20 corporate users by the end of 
fiscal 1994. (Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 26 May 94) 
  MPT's advisory body, the Telecommunications Technology 
Council, will decide in June the closed caption system to be 
adopted for transmitting data and subtitles with communications 
satellite TV broadcasts. This will open up the way for new media 
and services, such as facsimile communications and provision of 
English subtitles, using a CS TV data channel. The system is 
expected to be put into commercial use in about May 1995. (Tokyo 
NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 26 May 94) 
  Toshiba has developed a simulator capable of simulating 
shapes of chemically amplified resist. Expected to be 
commercially feasible with 256Mbit or larger DRAM production, 
the simulator enables users to compute various simulation 
processes pertinent to chemically amplified resist, ranging from 
the formation of optical images to the generation of oxygen at 
times of exposure, the diffusion of oxygen in post exposure 
heat, the dissolution of a solution suppressor, resin 
dissolution speeds, and to development. (Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO 
SHIMBUN 31 May 94) 
  Shinmaywa Industries has introduced a single-wafer 
sputtering 
system for use in hard disk drive production. The new system is 
a cluster tool consisting of a central chamber and up to eight 
process and load-lock chambers. Compared to in-line systems, the 
new system achieves higher film quality and has an hourly 
throughput of 360 disks. The company will combine the new system 
with its existing equipment such as clean robots, assembly 
automation systems, and clean room-less systems to take orders 
for integrated HDD production lines. (Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO 
31 May 94) 
  Toshiba has developed a 3.5-inch phase-change optical disk 
drive, which it plans to commercialize by 1996 when an 
international standard for phase-change optical disks is 
expected to be established. The drive uses a 690nm red 
semiconductor laser to write and read and data to and from a 
phase-change disks simultaneously and achieves a recording 
density about 50% higher than conventional 5.25-inch 
units and 
a data transfer speed of 9.1Mbit/s, four times and 20% 
faster 
than CD-ROM and magneto-optic drives, respectively. The drive 
supports 600Mbytes. When data is compressed to 1/40 the original 
size using the MPEG2 (Motion Picture Experts Group) data coding 
standard, it is possible to store video pictures for 20 minutes. 
(Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 16 May 94) 
  Canon has developed a technique for manufacturing SOI 
(silicon on insulator) substrates at a low cost. The technique 
involves five processes. (1) A wafer is processed in 
hydrofluoric acid to create a porous silicon layer on wafer 
surface. (2) A thin monocrystal silicon layer is deposited on 
the porous silicon layer. (3) The wafer is attached to another 
wafer which has an insulating layer made of silicon oxide. (4) 
The first wafer is etched from the bottom to expose the porous 
silicon layer. (5) The substrate is etched in a solution 
containing hydrofluoric acid and hydrogen peroxide. SOI 
substrates are commonly used for military and space 
equipment-use semiconductors because of high prices, but the 
company claims that the technique can help cut SOI substrate 
prices to a level about two times higher than conventional 
silicon wafers. (Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 16 May 94) 
  Fujitsu Laboratories has succeeded in oscillating an InP 
(indium phosphide) semiconductor laser using a current of 1.0mA. 
InP is the only semiconductor laser material capable of emitting 
1.3-micron light but has drawbacks: it has large threshold 
current, and it is susceptible to temperature changes. To lower 
threshold current the company has modified a distorted quantum 
well structure. It has discovered that the lowest level of 
threshold current is achieved when there are five quantum well 
layers, layer thickness is set at 8nm, and active layer width is 
set at 1 micron. In an experiment, the InP semiconductor laser 
could oscillate at threshold currents of 1.0mA at room 
temperature and of 3.5mA at 80 deg C. Using the semiconductor 
laser the company has developed a prototype functional 
10-channel laser array. (Tokyo NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 17 May 94) 
  The Electrotechnical Laboratory of the Agency of Industrial 
Science &amp; Technology and Kawasaki Heavy Industry (KHI) have 
succeeded in oscillating a free electron laser inside the 
ultraviolet zone. The lab and KHI have used the lab's NIJI-IV, a 
small free electron laser ring which is 4m long and 13m wide and 
has a circumference of 29.6m, and oscillated a 353nm laser. This 
is the first time that a free electron laser has been 
successfully oscillated inside the ultraviolet zone. KHI plans 
to combine the small ring with a synchronous orbit radiation 
system and market them as a set to research institutions. (Tokyo 
NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 17 May 94, Tokyo NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 17 May

  NTT has developed a heat-resistant polymer for use as an 
optical IC material. The polymer is called polysiloxane 
deuteride, made of silicon, oxygen, carbon, and deuterium, has 
silicon and oxygen atoms connected one after another like 
chains, a structure similar to that of glass, and can resist 
heat as high as 400 deg C. Silicon atoms are coupled with carbon 
atoms, which are attached to deuterium atoms. Deuterium is used 
instead of hydrogen to improve the polymer's transparency. Using 
the new material, the company has developed a prototype optical 
waveguide, a path to transmit light inside an optical IC, and 
has confirmed that 98% of light is transmitted. (Tokyo 
NIKKEI 
SANGYO SHIMBUN 18 May 94) 
  MITI has drafted an Enhanced Computerization Program 
designed 
both to support the Japanese government's strategy of 
computerizing public sector facilities and to provide direct 
links with the U.S.'s so-called national information 
infrastructure (NII). MITI's plan calls for designating five 
areas, such as education and research, for computerization and 
preparation of data communications networks, then providing 
direct mutual access to electronic libraries and government 
databases in Japan and the U.S. via PCs. The ministry intends to 
firm up the plan as early as the end of July and work it into 
the fiscal 1995 budget as a key item. (Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI 
SHIMBUN 18 May 94) 
  Matsushita Electric has developed phase-change optical disk 
recording techniques for boosting recording density to 4.1Mbit 
per sq. millimeters, 4.4 times over conventional methods. The 
newly developed mark edge recording technique reduces bit 
intervals to 0.35 micron, and the land group recording technique 
treats convex land tracks as recording tracks and reduces a 
track pitch to 0.7 micron. Using the new techniques it will be 
possible to develop a 5.25-inch optical disk with a storage 
capacity of 6Gbytes. The company is aiming for the 
commercialization of such a disk two years from now. (Tokyo 
DEMPA SHIMBUN 19 May 94, Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 19 May 94, 
Tokyo NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 19 May 94, Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 
19 May 94, Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO 19 May 94) 
  Toshiba has developed a NAND flash memory cell using a 
0.4-micron design rule. The NAND is the company's proprietary 
flash memory format which lines up eight cells along a bit line. 
The cell is 1.13 sq. microns, about 80% the size of 16Mbit 
flash memory cells. The company estimates that a 64Mbit chip 
will be about 120 sq. millimeters when developed using the 
process. The fine process has been made possible by the FTI 
process Toshiba has newly developed which forms an oxide film 
and then implants phosphorus to prevent a diffusion layer from 
spreading. The development of a 64Mbit flash memory chip will 
pave the way for the development of a 160Mbyte flash memory card 
for use in PCs. (Tokyo NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 19 May 94) 
  Matsushita Electric has developed techniques for forming 
circuits on an injection-molded plastic substrate. One method is 
to create circuits on such a substrate using conductive paste, 
and the other is to expose a substrate coated with copper foil 
using a laser and eliminate the non-exposed portion through 
chemical etching. The company is working with its subsidiary to 
apply the techniques to development of automotive components. 
(Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO 23 May 94) 
  NEC Cable Media, a cable TV subsidiary of NEC, has developed 
a technology that allows unused CATV channels to be used for 
about 100 telephone lines. It is the first time such technology 
has been commercialized in Japan. With the new system, CATV 
subscribers will be able to get telephone service without going 
through NTT. The technology represents a major technical step 
forward for the merging of communications and multimedia 
broadcasts. With the TDMA (time division multiple access) 
digital format, one unused cable TV channel can accommodate the 
equivalent of 96 telephone lines. (Tokyo NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 23 
May 94) 
  The Nippon Sheet Glass Technical Research Laboratory and the 
Electrotechnical Laboratory of the Agency of Industrial Science 
&amp; Technology have jointly developed a non-linear optical 
material for use in optical computers. The material has cadmium 
telluride and silicon oxide layers deposited on a quartz 
substrate one after another. Cadmium telluride particles of 3nm 
in diameter are deposited over the substrate using laser 
deposition. Through plasma excitation chemical vapor deposition 
a 30nm-thick silicon oxide layer is deposited over the cadmium 
telluride layer. The deposition processes are repeated 40-50 
times to develop a 1-micron-thick, 2cm square material, which 
can convert the wavelength of light to 1/3 the original in 1ps, 
about 10 times faster than other materials. (Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO 
SHIMBUN 24 May 94) 
  NEC has developed a 64bit RISC (reduced instruction set 
computer) microprocessor based on the MIPS Technologies 
architecture. Designed using a 0.35-micron CMOS two-layer 
process, the chip runs at 200MHz and 100MHz internally and 
externally, respectively, and operates on 3.3V. Consisting of 
2.3 million transistors, the 13x16mm chip comes in two types: 
the micro PD30410/2-200 are housed in 179- and 447-pin ceramic 
PGA packages, which are compatible with the VR4400PC and the 
VR4400MC, respectively. Both are sample-priced at 200,000 yen 
($1,923.08). Sample shipment will start on May 23, and volume 
production is slated for October. NEC plans to manufacture 
10,000 units per month from January 1995. (Tokyo DEMPA SHIMBUN

  Toshiba has developed a 64bit RISC (reduced instruction set 
computer) microprocessor based on the MIPS Technologies 
architecture. To be sampled from June, the TC86R4400-200 
features internal and external clock speeds of 200MHz and 
100MHz, respectively, and operates on 3.3V. Designed using a 
0.3-micron CMOS process, the chip measures 9.8x13.7mm, about 
40% smaller than the NEC chip also developed using MIPS' 
technology, and integrates 2.3 million transistors. Sample 
prices range from 310,000 yen ($2.980.77) to 400,000 yen

  Matsushita Electric has developed a GaAs (gallium arsenide) 
power MMIC (microwave monolithic IC) for use in digital mobile 
communications devices. Capable of operating on 3.0V, the MMIC 
consists of field effect transistors and impedance rectifier 
circuits. The gate length has been reduced from 1.0 micron to 
0.8 micron, and the distance between the source and the drain 
has been reduced by 1.5 microns to lower threshold voltage from 
1.7V to 1.2V, making it possible to operate the MMIC on 3.0V. By 
making a drain bias circuit an external circuit, a voltage loss 
has been minimized at 0.05V, down from 0.06V, and the size of 
the chip has been reduced to 1.0x1.5mm, about 60% the 
size of 
conventional MMICs. Targeting makers of personal handy phone 
systems, Matsushita intends to release a commercial version 
within the year. (Tokyo DEMPA SHIMBUN 24 May 94, Tokyo NIKKAN

  Sharp has developed a new IC, LCD photoetching production 
technique that provides continuous decomposition control of 
micro-organisms produced during the photoetching process. The 
new technique permits reductions in the size of production 
equipment, thus reducing production costs, and can also 
eliminate nitrogen, which is a cause of red tide, and surface 
active agents. A pilot plant, which has developed the new 
technique is conducting research in order to commercialize the 
technique. Sharp is aiming to introduce the new technique at its 
own LCD production centers, and is also considering providing 
the technique as well as a water monitoring technique developed 
at the same pilot plant to other companies. (Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO

  MPT has decided to expand the number of channels available 
for communications satellite-based broadcasting. Twelve 
transponders are in use for CS TV broadcasts, with Space 
Communications Corp. (SCC) and Japan Satellite Systems (JSAT) 
each operating six. The plan is to increase the number by an 
additional 10 or more. Sumitomo Corp. plans to enter the CS TV 
business this year using an SCC satellite, and the ministry 
expects the number of CS TV stations to continue to grow, 
requiring more transponders. A formal decision will be made this 
fall. (Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 24 May 94) 
  Toshiba has developed a blue-green LED with a brightness of 
2cd. Capable of emitting a 500nm beam, the device uses a GaAs 
(gallium arsenide) substrate instead of one made of sapphire, 
and zinc selenide layers are deposited on the substrate forming 
a quantum-well structure. In an experiment, when 20mA current 
was run, the LED generated an optical output of 0.13W for more 
than 10 minutes. Since red and green LEDs use the same substrate 
as the blue-green LED, it is now possible to create red, green, 
and blue-green LEDs on the same substrate, a technology needed 
to develop a full-color display. (Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 24

  NTT has developed a crystal capable of recording high-speed 
video pictures. The company claims that at 7K (-266 deg C) 
europium-doped yttrium silicate can theoretically record a frame 
in 1x10-E9 second. Since it is possible to record different 
pictures on the same recording medium by changing laser beam 
frequency by 1KHz, the crystal can store 10 million still 
picture frames, the equivalent of 100 hours of black-and-white 
TV broadcasting or 30 hours of color video pictures. NTT has 
already developed a high-precision dye laser for recording and 
playing holography pictures. (Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 25 May

  NEC has developed a silicon deposition technique capable of 
forming an atom-thick layer. The technique uses silicon 
dichloride gas with strong adhesive power as a material gas in 
order to control layer thickness at the atomic level. Silicon 
dichloride is chemically unstable, and therefore it can easily 
be attached to a silicon substrate. As a result, the efficiency 
in use of the material gas is boosted 1,000 times over 
conventional techniques, and film deposition has become possible 
at room temperature. NEC thinks that the technique will pave the 
way for the development of gigabit-level memory. (Tokyo NIHON

  [Text] Seoul, June 25 (YONHAP) -- As the proposed 
South-North summit meeting approaches realization, the South 
Korean Government has prepared a draft agreement on the summit 
for discussion during an inter-Korean preparatory contact slated 
for Tuesday at Panmunjom. 
  An informed official source said Saturday the draft covers 
the summit's date and place, the number of attendants and the 
period of visits. 
  The source said the government believes the first summit 
talks should occur by mid-July at the latest and that Seoul or 
Pyongyang should be the site. 
  Panmunjom is not included in the Seoul side's list of 
candidate venues for the summit talks, he said. 
  The government welcomed North Korea's selection of Kim 
Yong-sun, chairman of the Unification Policy Committee of the 
Supreme People's Assembly, as its chief delegate to the 
South-North preparatory contact next Tuesday. 
  Noting that Kim belongs to the faction advocating more 
openness, a Seoul official said his selection may well point to 
Pyongyang's good intentions toward the proposed summit. 
  North Korea informed the South Saturday morning that it had 
chosen Kim as chief delegate to next Tuesday's contact. The two 
other delegates are An Pyong-su, vice chairman of the Committee 
for Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, and Paek Nam-chun, 
a State Council member.

  [Text] Kim Yong-sun, a top strategist on South Korean 
affairs and a member of North Korean President Kim Il-song's 
trusted inner circle, will represent Pyongyang's delegation to 
Tuesday's preliminary contact for an inter-Korean summit. 
  The choice of Kim, concurrently chairman of the 
Reunification 
Policy Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, shows how 
much importance the North Korean leader places in the 
forthcoming summit, South Korean officials said. 
  North Korean Prime Minister Kang Song-san notified his South 
Korean counterpart Yi Yong-tok through a telephone message 
Saturday that the influential official will lead a three-member 
delegation at the Panmunjom meeting designed to set the date and 
venue for the summit. 
  The other delegates are An Pyong-su, vice chairman of the 
Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, and 
Paek Nam-chun, councilor of the Administration Council, it said. 
  Kim who will take part in his first inter-Korean contact, is 
known as an advocate of reform and openness. Moreover, Kim was 
the North Korean representative to the first vice ministerial 
dialogue with the United States in January 1992, when he met 
with then U.S. Under Secretary of State Arnold Kanter. The 
meeting, though not substantial, marked the first major sign of 
the possibility of normalizing relations between the two 
countries. He stepped into the spotlight in September 1990 when 
he met with Japanese political patriarch Shin Kanemaru and 
produced a joint statement on an early normalization of the 
relations between North Korea and Japan. 
  Kim, who is also secretary for South Korean affairs in the 
North Korean Nodong (Workers) Party enjoys strong backing from 
President Kim Il-song and his son Chong-il. Kim's closeness to 
President Kim has caused the spread of rumors that they are 
related by blood. He showed how close his ties are with the 
North Korean leader by accompanying Kim on his visit to China 
and on other travels from the late 1980s. Kim is said to have 
advised Kim Il-song and his heir-apparent Chong-il to introduce 
more openness after a tour of Europe in March 1990. 
  Kim survived factional infighting within the communist party 
last year when he was stripped of his post as a candidate for 
the Politburo after conservatives criticized liberals' 
unfruitful economic reforms. 
  The two other delegates, in contrast, are seasoned officials 
of inter-Korean dialogue who served as delegates to the prime 
ministers' talks. 
  An Pyong-su has a single-track career in dealing with South 
Koran affairs. He has worked for the Committee for the Peaceful 
Reunification of the Fatherland since he graduated from Kim 
Il-song University. He serves as vice chairman of the committee 
along with chief delegate Kim Yong-sun. He captivated the South 
Korean media as North Korean spokesman for the inter-Korean 
prime ministers' talks with his glib tongue. 
  Meanwhile, Paek Nam-chun also graduated from Kim Il-song 
University. He became involved in South Korean affairs as an 
advisor to the North Korea Red Cross Society during inter-Korean 
dialogue back in 1972. Except for a brief stint as ambassador to 
Poland, Paek has served as a point man in North Korea's contacts 
with South Korea.

  [Text] It was learned on 26 June that the government is 
reviewing a draft proposal to be presented to the North Korean 
side regarding the North-South summit suggesting that the top 
leaders of the two sides take turns in visiting Seoul and 
Pyongyang and that the first talks be held in Seoul over two 
nights and three days, preferably in mid-July, if North Korea 
agrees. 
  However, if North Korea persists on having talks in 
Pyongyang 
first, the government will accept this on the condition that the 
first talks be held in Pyongyang in July and the second are held 
in Seoul in August. 
  In the event that the two sides fail to reach an agreement 
to 
designate Seoul and Pyongyang as the venue for the talks, the 
government will propose Panmunjom as the first alternate place, 
and Seoul or Pyongyang as the venue for the second talks. 
  The government will submit to President Kim Yong-sam for 
approval on 27 June a draft of "the agreement for holding a 
North-South summit between the North and the South," which will 
be presented to the North Korean side during a preliminary 
contact for a North-South summit slated for 28 June. 
  This draft agreement includes various conditions and forms 
to 
be proposed by the South side pertaining to the summit, 
including the time and place of the talks, itineraries, 
entourages, and the number of accompanying reporters. 
  Earlier on Sunday 26 June, the government made a final 
review 
of the preparatory works for the preliminary contact by 
conducting a mock conference in the office of the North-South 
talks in Samchongdong, Seoul, attended by our side's delegates 
to the preliminary contact, including Yi Hong-ku, vice prime 
minister and unification minister; Chong Chong-uk, senior 
presidential secretary for diplomatic and security affairs; and 
Yun Yo-chun, special assistant to the prime minister.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Seoul and Pyongyang Should Be Avoided"] </F>
  [Text] It is our opinion that the designation of Seoul and 
Pyongyang as the venue for a North-South summit should be 
avoided. In other words, Seoul and Pyongyang should be avoided 
as the venue for the summit unless the North-South summit is 
held merely for the sake of talks. If President Kim Yong-sam 
visits Pyongyang, North Korea will report that "South Korea's 
Kim Yong-sam came to Pyongyang, the capital of the chuche 
revolution." And if Kim Il-song comes to Seoul, Kim Il-song 
himself will not be very pleased with his visit. Besides, North 
Korea, in its Pyongyang television network, will give enormous 
publicity to the banners of the students from the National 
Federation of University Student Councils [Hanchongnyon] and 
Kwangju-South Cholla Province District Alliance of University 
Student Councils [Namchongnyon], and members of the so-called 
Chuche Idea Faction [Chusapa] in South Korea, who warmly welcome 
"their leader's triumphal entry into Seoul." These two 
anticipated events are not desirable for the productivity of the 
talks. 
  What we are furthermore concerned about is the possibility 
that the talks may end up with external splendor but with no 
internal substance. This is because we are not sure about Kim 
Il-song's true intention and because "spectators" may dramatize 
the talks as the "greatest show on the earth." Truly, the talks 
this time should be held in a sincere atmosphere, should proceed 
in a substantive manner from the beginning to the end, and 
should advance toward the settlement of problems without 
becoming a show. To attain this, commotions over parties and 
ceremonies, making empty speeches, toasts, picture taking, 
spectators' racket, sightseeing, reporting of amusing gossip and 
stories, performance of stage shows, dinners hosted by mayors of 
Seoul and Pyongyang, and other show-like events, as seen in the 
past, should be totally excluded. This type of talks should not 
be attempted from the onset. 
  Instead, the top leaders of the two sides should meet in a 
secluded villa or a country house in Mt. Sorak in the South and 
Mt. Kumgang in the North, and in-depth discussions should be 
held calmly on key points of essential issues without having any 
banquet and delivering speeches. In addition, the attempt of 
so-called well-known figures and VIP's wishing to join the 
event, should be thoroughly blocked. For this, it is furthermore 
necessary for the two top leaders to hold a calm, substantive 
meeting in a place far from the capital sphere. 
  Thus, we hope that during the 28 June preliminary contact 
the 
two sides will designate a third place for a summit, other than 
Seoul and Pyongyang, and will agree to have only officials 
concerned attend the event and not hold festival-like events by 
inviting unnecessary celebrities. If they really want to have 
some people attend the site, it whould better to invite 
children. We wish to see that sincere talks be held in a plain 
and even pious atmosphere by excluding spectators.

  [Text] Seoul, June 27 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government is mulling the suspension of the joint Korea-U.S. 
Team Spirit military maneuver tenatively set for coming November 
if an inter-Korean summit is realized as proposed and a 
breakthrough is provided in the resolution of the nuclear 
question. 
  A senior official said on Monday Nuclear Affairs Ambassador 
Kim Sam-hun would convey this position to the United States when 
he visits Washington this week. 
  His visit would be to put final touches to a 
Seoul-Washington 
stratgegy toward the third-round U.S.-North Korea high-level 
talks taking place on July 8. 
  A source said the government would ask Washington not to 
take 
up the Team Spirit issue at the upcoming third-round talks since 
the issue of whether to resume the annual exercises hinges 
rather in the allevation of tension on the Korean peninsual than 
in the nuclear issue only. 
  Through Ambassador Kim, the Seoul Government would also 
express its support for the U.S. plan to exchange permanent 
liaison missions between Washington and Pyongyang if North Korea 
firmly guarantees the transparency of their nuclear past, 
present and future, the official said. 
  The government would further convey to the United States its 
existing stand that Seoul sees no reason why it should oppose 
diplomatic normalization between Washington and North Korea if 
North Korea resolves pending problems other than the nuclear one 
such as the suspension of missile exports and renouncement of 
terrorism. 
  Regarding the question of replacing North Korean atomic 
reactors with light-water ones, a working-level meeting opening 
in Washington this week among South Korea, U.S. and Japan would 
explore the possibility of South Korea and Japan furnishing 
funds and the United States technical knowhow to North Korea for 
the project, the official added.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu </F>
at his office in the Central Government Building in Seoul, by 
Hwang Chae-hong, TONG-A ILBO senior political affairs desk 
reporter -- date not given] 
  [Text] The North Korean nuclear problem, which once drove 
the Korean peninsula into an extreme pitch of tension, now faces 
a phase of negotiations. A preliminary contact for a 
North-South summit is to be held on 28 June at Panmunjom and a 
third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level talks will be held in 
Geneva early next month. 
  Although the people consider such an abrupt change in the 
situation fortunate, they can hardly conceal their suspicion. 
North Korea showed a drastic change in its attitude so as to 
curve around sanctions directed against it by the UN Security 
Council into dialogue. Nevertheless, people are becoming more 
concerned about whether or not the North Korean nuclear problem 
will be solved peacefully through such an atmosphere of dialogue. 
  As for the issue regarding a North-South summit toward which 
the government was somewhat hasty, will the top leaders of the 
North and the South actually sit together for the first time 
since the nation was divided? To what degree will the summit, 
when realized, contribute to removing factors increasing 
tensions on the Korean peninsula? These are questions the 
people are concerned about. 
  Since the new government came to office, Foreign Minister 
Han 
Sung-chu has taken the initiative of leading government policy 
on the North Korean nuclear problem. This reporter met with 
Foreign Minister Han in his office. 
  [Reporter Hwang Chae-hong] Since former U.S. President 
Carter visited North Korea, the North Korean nuclear issue has 
made a drastic turn from a phase of sanctions to that of 
dialogue. Both affirmative and negative assessments about 
Carter's visit to North Korea are seen even in the United 
States. What is our government's overall evaluation of his 
visit? 
  [Minister Han Sung-chu] North Korea proposed a North-South 
summit and revealed the will to freeze nuclear development 
through former U.S. President Carter. Following this, North 
Korea agreed on a preliminary contact for a North-South summit, 
and confirmed its will to freeze nuclear development through a 
diplomatic channel. This being the case, our government feels 
that Mr. Carter's visit laid the foundation for a third round of 
North Korea-U.S. talks and provided a chance for a solution to 
the North Korean nuclear problem through dialogue. However, the 
sincerity of North Korea's will to implement what it pledged is 
more important. Thus, the government will watch how the 
situation develops with keen interest and make efforts to solve 
the North Korean nuclear problem. 
  [Hwang] What is your assessment of the reasons behind North 
Korea's prompt acceptance of the proposal for a preliminary 
contact on a North-South summit after having been passive in the 
past? 
  [Minister Han] It seems that North Korea wanted to turn the 
situation in which sanctions against itself were discussed on a 
full scale, to a phase of dialogue. North Korea also indicated 
its sincerity by confirming the message it sent through Mr. 
Carter. 
  [Hwang] Can we then say that North Korea yielded because of 
the sanctions discussed by the UN Security Council against 
itself? 
  [Minister Han] Instead of using the word, "yield," which is 
partly related to the implementation of sanctions, we may say 
that North Korea was prompted by the necessity to turn the phase 
of sanctions into that of dialogue. [end Minister Han] 
  Minister Han expressed his faith that we should view 
North-South relations from the standpoint that what is 
advantageous to North Korea is not always disadvantageous to us. 
Thus, he stressed that the recent change in North Korean 
attitude should not be viewed as "yielding" in an inevitable 
situation. 
  [Hwang] What is your opinion on the possibility of a 
North-South summit? 
  [Minister Han] It is higher than ever before. Judging from 
its response to our proposal for a preliminary contact, the 
North Korean side's motivation for realizing a North-South 
summit seems to be very great. 
  [Hwang] We believe that if a summit is held, the North 
Korean nuclear issue, the issue of reuniting families separated 
between the North and the South, expansion of exchanges between 
people, and a historic conclusion of the Korean war, can be 
discussed at the summit. Which does the government plan on 
giving priority? 
  [Minister Han] The government has decided to push the summit 
ahead without any conditions. Therefore, we will not clearly 
designate any agenda items in advance. In view of the prevailing 
situation, elimination of tensions created by the nuclear 
problem, improvement of North-South relations, expansion of 
cooperation, and some other issues may be broadly discussed, 
thus seeking methods for laying a foundation for reunification 
in the end. 
  Since the joint denuclearization declaration and the 
basic agreement were already adopted by the North and the South, 
the nuclear issue and improvement of relations may serve as a 
basis for discussion. [end Minister Han] 
  Minister Han is deeply involved in the government's 
decisionmaking as a full member of the Unification and Security 
Policy Coordination Council. He answered questions on the 
North-South summit very cautiously. Concerning the prospect for 
success of the summit, he stressed that the meeting between the 
two sides itself is of epoch-making significance. Thus, the 
result of the talks should not be evaluated in black-and-white 
terms, but the meeting itself should be given significance. 
Thus, if the two sides agree on even general matters, such as 
subsequent talks, a promise to cooperate with each other in the 
future, and so forth, the atmosphere of dialogue will be 
significantly improved. 
  [Hwang] Let us turn the topic to a third round of North 
Korean-U.S. talks. The United States announced that it will hold 
a third round of high-level talks with North Korea early next 
month. What are the targets that both the United States and the 
ROK will pursue at the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks? 
  [Minister Han] The third round of talks will be focused on 
totally eliminating suspicion of North Korea's nuclear 
development. The ROK and U.S. position is that security and 
various other political and economic issues that have been 
previously raised by North Korea can be broadly discussed if the 
North Korean nuclear problem is completely solved. 
  [Hwang] It was learned, however, that the United States has 
abandoned efforts to examine North Korea's past nuclear 
activities, and in return, has demanded that North Korea freeze 
its nuclear development. As a result, people now doubt that 
there is agreement in views between the ROK and the United 
States. Is this true, Mr. Minister? 
  [Minister Han] It is the firm position of the ROK and the 
United States that transparency of the past, present, and future 
nuclear activities of North Korea should be ensured by all means 
for a complete solution to the North Korean nuclear problem. 
  It is true, however, that there was a debate on whether the 
issue of verification of past activities should be a 
precondition for a third round of North Korean-U.S. talks or be 
discussed during the talks. From the tactical point of view, 
both the ROK and the United States agreed on resumption of North 
Korean-U.S. dialogue by making North Korea promise to freeze its 
nuclear development, which is urgently required, and on a 
thoroughgoing discussion of the issue of verifying its past 
nuclear activities during the third round of North Korean-U.S. 
talks. Thus, there is no difference in views between the two 
countries. [end Minister Han] 
  Minister Han stressed that the North Korean nuclear problem, 
which started due to suspicion of North Korea's past nuclear 
activities and the UN Security Council began to discuss 
sanctions due to the suspicion of North Korean past nuclear 
activities, has not been removed. Therefore, the act of 
abandoning verification of the past is the same as abandoning 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty itself. This being the case, 
not only the ROK and the United States, but also the 
international community will never overlook North Korea's past 
nuclear activities. 
  [Hwang] As North Korea unilaterally replaced fuel rods 
in the five-megawatt reactor, some people wonder if there are 
technical means to assure North Korea's past nuclear 
transparency. Do you think special inspections [tukpyol sachal] 
on undeclared facilities could thoroughly verify past nuclear 
activities? 
  [Minister Han] Past nuclear activities could be verified if 
North Korea actively cooperates by accepting special inspections 
of the two undeclared facilities, which North Korea insists are 
military facilities, and by correctly reporting the quantity of 
extracted plutonium. We will continue to exert efforts in 
various ways so that North Korea shows a positive attitude in 
resolving this issue through the third round of North 
Korean-U.S. talks. 
  [Hwang] North Korea has insisted that the nuclear issue and 
the improvement of North Korean-U.S. relations should be 
resolved in a package deal at the third round of North 
Korean-U.S. talks. How do you plan to respond to this? 
  [Minister Han] North Korea's package solution proposes a 
simultaneous exchange of all the issues related to North Korea's 
nuclear suspicion. The problem with the proposal is that North 
Korea is bargaining its obligations as a member of the 
international community and obligations in North-South 
relations. North Korea has made it difficult to resolve the 
issue in a phased manner by binding the prerequisite obligations 
and fundamental obligations in one bundle. We will exert a wide 
range of efforts to resolve the issue through dialogue, 
including the improvement of North Korean-U.S. relations under 
the precondition of the resolution of the nuclear issue, while 
creating the circumstances for North Korea to fulfill its 
inspection obligations. 
  [Hwang] The Democratic Liberal Party recently urged the 
government to reconsider the declaration on the denuclearization 
of the Korean peninsula if North Korea delays the assurance of 
nuclear transparency. What is the government's position 
regarding public opinion urging nuclear independence and the 
reconsideration of the declaration on the denuclearization? 
  [Minister Han] The government has consistently adhered to 
the earnest implementation of the joint declaration on the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula because the 
implementation of the denuclearization declaration is the basis 
for achieving nuclear-free peace and order on the Korean 
peninsula, as well as in Northeast Asia and the entire world. 
It is true that people are saying that the joint declaration on 
denuclearization is useless when suspicion of North Korea's 
nuclear weapons development is escalating. The government's 
position on the compliance of the denuclearization declaration 
remains unchanged. Under the principle of the parties concerned 
in the North and the South, North Korea should respond to our 
efforts to implement the denuclearization declaration, including 
mutual inspection [sangho sachal], before it is too late. [end 
Minister Han] 
  Although the government has been criticized for alternating 
between hard-line and moderate policies on the North Korean 
nuclear issue, Minister Han has adhered to the "resolution 
through negotiations" theory and insisted on seeking peaceful 
resolutions through dialogue and negotiations since the 
beginning of the nuclear issue. Asked if the government's 
policy on the North Korean nuclear issue has not been based on 
national consensus, Minister Han said it is very difficult 
because "public opinion is distinctively divided and one policy 
is criticized both as hard-line and moderate." How the North 
Korean nuclear issue develops should depend on the result of the 
North-South summit talks and the third round of North 
Korean-U.S. talks.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Pak Chong-mun: "Prospects of North </F>
Korea-U.S. Talks"] 
  [Text] It seems certain that the third round of North 
Korean-U.S. talks will be held in early July, and the 
preliminary contact for the inter-Korean summit talks is 
scheduled for 28 June. The North Korean nuclear issue, 
therefore, is to be dealt with through the two channels of 
dialogue. 
  The binary dialogue lines--one between North Korea and the 
United States and the other between North and South Korea--mean 
a structural change from the four-plus-three method (the three 
dialogue channels between the North and the South, between the 
North and the United States, and between the North and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] in which four parties 
are involved) to the three-plus-two method in which the IAEA is 
not involved. The structural transformation of the dialogue 
method shows the probability that in-depth discussion will be 
held on practical problems. 
  When the IAEA participated in an independent dialogue, 
technical problems concerned with safeguards of the continuity 
of inspection surfaced one after another, often shaking the 
overall picture of the dialogue. 
  The upcoming North Korean-U.S. Geneva talks and the 
inter-Korean summit talks are likely to bring a considerable 
change in the contents of the dialogue as well. After North 
Korea declared the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty [NPT] in March of last year, North Korea and the United 
States discussed ways to resolve the nuclear issue in the first 
and second round of high- level talks in June and July, 
respectively. However, while the United States placed the 
primary emphasis on the discussion of the nuclear issue, North 
Korea focused on the improvement of its relations with the 
United States and the U.S. assistance in the installation of the 
light-water reactor, preventing the talks from making tangible 
progress. 
  However, in the upcoming third round of North Korean-U.S. 
talks, specific rather than principled ways for the complete 
return to the NPT, suspension of the present and future nuclear 
development, and the improvement of relations between the two 
countries will be discussed extensively. This may well bring 
about a certain degree of tangible results. 
  The mode of connection to be maintained between the two 
lines 
of dialogue depends primarily on the North Korean intent. North 
Korea has so far placed emphasis on its talks with the United 
States, and acceded to the inter-Korean dialogue in a limited 
manner as a measure to complement the North Korean-U.S. talks. 
It is likely that North Korea will follow the same style. 
There are signs that North Korea will hold the North 
Korean-U.S. talks before the inter- Korean summit. 
  In this connection, our government wishes to link the two 
lines of dialogue to maintain a balance between the progress in 
the North Korean-U.S. dialogue and the improvement of 
inter-Korean relations. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu did not 
outright link the two lines of dialogue, but said: "We need not 
attach substantial significance to which talks are held a few 
days before the other. Whether or not progress is made in the 
resolution of the nuclear issue through dialogue will be 
appraised on the overall basis after following the process of 
the two sets of talks." Foreign Minister Han's remarks suggest 
that if the South directly links the two sets of dialogue, this 
could give an impression that the South is shackling the United 
States. Therefore, the South is avoiding this situation and 
trying to avoid the blame for the stalemate that could result in 
the talks by having one set of talks directly affecting the 
other. 
  The North Korean-U.S. talks and the discussion for 
inter-Korean summit help suspend the discussion of UN sanctions 
and pave the way for dialogue. However, there are factors which 
may stand in the way of smooth progress of dialogue, including 
the conflicting interests among the North and South Korea and 
the United States. 
  The assistance in the replacement of reactors with 
light-water reactors is one of the most controversial points. 
North Korea wishes the United States to make arrangements with 
an international monetary institution for the supply of funds to 
North Korea for the construction of light-water reactors in 
return for its freezing its nuclear development. The United 
States, however, is hardly able to give North Korea satisfactory 
assurances because of the limitation in its national treasury. 
  By obtaining specific assurances for the construction of 
light-water reactors, North Korea intends to have the economic 
sanctions against it dissolved and resolve the hostile relations 
with the West as well. Therefore, North Korea is not likely to 
part with its nuclear-freeze card in exchange for a mere promise 
of assistance by the United States. Hence, how the United 
States deals with the issue of assistance in the installation of 
light-water reactors will be a key to the success of the talks. 
  Another important matter connected with the success of the 
talks is how the two sides will conclude the issue of tracing 
the past nuclear history of North Korea. North Korea is also 
raising the issue of not using nuclear weapons against North 
Korea, and the United States is planning to deal with the North 
Korean development and export of missiles. 
  Thus, there are quite a few difficult problems lying ahead, 
but since both North Korea and the United States are not 
concealing their desire to resolve the long hostile relations in 
the talks, we will watch with expectation the turn of events 
that will develop.

  [Text] It was learned on 24 June that the government is 
reviewing a plan to request that the United States ask North 
Korea, in the North Korea-U.S. high-level talks slated for early 
July, that North Korea export the used nuclear fuel and 
plutonium that was produced inevitably in the course of 
reprocessing, to a third country. 
  A relevant Foreign Ministry official said that "the 
reprocessing process that generates plutonium is inevitable if 
North Korea permanently stores extracted nuclear fuel rods." He 
added that "in the event that North Korea attempts to merely 
store fuel rods without reprocessing them, there is the danger 
of explosion and of radioactivity leakage."

<F P=106> [By YONHAP from UN Headquarters] </F>
  [Text] The United States and North Korea held a 
working-level contact at the UN Headquarters in New York on the 
evening of 24 June. The two sides discussed the agenda and date 
for the third round of high-level talks expected to be held in 
Geneva in early July. 
  The results of the contact is yet to be known. However, a 
relevant official at the North Korean mission said that there 
were no particular difficulties in the contact, thus hinting 
that the high-level talks are likely to be held on 8 July, as 
requested by the North Korean side, and that the two sides 
reached an agreement on the agenda. 
  In the third round of high-level talks, the United States 
and 
North Korea are expected to discuss extensively the issue on 
permanently freezing North Korea's nuclear development, 
including its full return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty, its suspension of reprocessing nuclear fuel, and the 
acceptance of special [tukbyol] inspections. In addition, 
chances are high that they would discuss the issue concerning 
the establishment of diplomatic ties, including the replacement 
of light-water moderated reactors and economic aid. 
  In the contact, Gary Seymour, director of the U.S. State 
Department, led the U.S. delegation while Han Song-yol, 
counselor at the North Korean mission to the United Nations, 
represented the North Korean side.

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Song-chu: "The Prospect for U.S.-North Korea </F>
Summit in the Wake of U.S. Secretary of State's Remarks"] 
  [Text] After former U.S. President Jimmy Carter visited 
North Korea, a breakthrough in the North Korean nuclear issue 
has suddenly been made, paving the way for an inter-Korean 
summit--the first one ever--and the third round of high-level 
U.S.-North Korea talks slated for next month. With these talks 
ahead, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in a CNN 
interview on 24 June, touched on the possibility of a summit 
between U.S. President Bill Clinton and North Korean President 
Kim Il-song. 
  In light of this, public interest is arising on a U.S.-North 
Korea summit. 
  When asked about the chances for a U.S.-North Korea summit, 
Secretary of State Christopher said that North Korea has not yet 
established the kind of record that would justify a U.S.-North 
Korea summit. But, he said that such a possibility exists if 
North Korea changes its present stance and starts having the 
kind of behavior that justifies a summit. 
  Since he made clear that this would only come after the 
normalization of bilateral diplomatic ties, holding such a 
meeting at an early date would be realistically impossible. 
However, the fact that the issue was brought up hints several 
things. 
  First, the U.S. Government insinuated that it has the will 
to 
normalize diplomatic ties, aside from the chances of a summit. 
This may promote bilateral relations sooner than expected. In 
other words, by partly showing a carrot, "a bilateral summit," 
this could induce North Korea to assume a more flexible stance. 
  The card called a U.S.-North Korea summit is something that 
deserves to be considered by President Clinton, who has repeated 
diplomatic failures in the Bosnian crisis, the extension of 
China's most-favorite-nation status, and the Haitian matter. 
  President Clinton has received criticism from both the 
ruling 
and opposition parties for being incompetent and indecisive on 
the North Korean nuclear issue. Under such a condition, he may 
attempt to get a firm political foothold with a summit with 
President Kim Il-song. 
  With a nonpresidential election slated for next November, 
the 
Democratic Party is now in a weaker position than the Republican 
Party. 
  For President Kim Il-song, who became a familiar face to the 
American people as he appeared on U.S. television day after day 
after Carter's visit to Pyongyang, he could bear diplomatic 
fruits beyond his expectations in the event the summit is held. 
  Explaining the results of his visit to the United States, 
former U.S. President Carter once said that "There is something 
I have not talked about" and "this can only be told to Clinton 
and Christopher." Chances are high that it has something to do 
with the summit. 
  Nonetheless, we will just have to wait and see to confirm 
whether or not Secretary of State Christopher's remark is mere 
diplomatic rhetoric.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Abrupt Reference to North Korean-U.S. Summit </F>
Talks"] 
  [Text] The U.S. secretary of state's reference to a North 
Korean-U.S. summit heralds an important change in the U.S. 
policy to the North. Although Secretary Christopher says that 
North Korea should change its attitude before the summit can be 
held, his remark is all the more noteworthy because we are at a 
critical point in our endeavor to resolve the North Korean 
nuclear issue. Moreover, because the remark was made by someone 
who is responsible for U.S. foreign policy, we are even led to 
suspect that since the recent North Korean peace overture, some 
secret exchange of messages might have taken place between North 
Korea and the United States. 
  If such a secret exchange of messages was not made, we can 
hardly understand why the United States suggests the possibility 
of another summit now that the inter-Korean summit talks have 
been agreed on. We do not object to the ending of many years of 
hostile relations between Washington and Pyongyang and the 
U.S.-North Korean diplomatic negotiations after the North Korean 
nuclear issue is ultimately resolved. The ROK support for 
sanctions on North Korea was not for the sake of sanctions 
themselves; it was to induce North Korea to negotiate. The ROK, 
more than the United States, must take the lead in inducing the 
closed and isolated North Korea to become a responsible member 
of the international community. This is so because it is a 
national problem directly connected to our survival. 
  This being the case, it would not be too late to hold a 
North 
Korean-U.S. summit after the inter-Korean summit is held and 
after meaningful progress between Seoul and Pyongyang is made. 
At present, only the date has been agreed on for the third 
round North Korean-U.S. high-level talks, and the two sides have 
yet to negotiate on the key agenda items. North Korea has only 
expressed its willingness to freeze its nuclear program, but the 
United States is hastily moving to bring a package solution to 
the pending political and military issues. 
  The U.S. strategic team should in the first place verify the 
truth behind North Korea's abrupt tactical change. They should 
find out why North Korea suddenly changed its stance toward 
dialogue with the proposal to freeze its nuclear program. They 
should know that with such a tactical change, North Korea 
intends to incapacitate the ROK, rather than resolve the nuclear 
issue, with the assertion on the "mutual troop reduction to 
100,000 men" and to get the U.S. troops withdrawn from the ROK 
with the "peace agreement." The United States should not make 
the mistake of being implicated in a peace gesture North Korea 
habitually employs and of naively accepting the North Korean 
proposal without a safety-proof device. 
  Peace will not settle on the Korean peninsula even if 
dialogue and talks are conducted while the problems connected 
with the security of the country are being overlooked. The 
United States might even find itself giving a tacit approval to 
North Korea's nuclear armament. North Korea's tricky peace 
overture and the easy-going U.S. policy toward the North as 
evidenced by Secretary Christopher's remark "We can hold summit 
talks with North Korea" can cause a rift in the ROK-U.S. 
cooperative alliance in dealing with the North Korean nuclear 
issue. What the ROK and the United States need at present is to 
reconfirm their unshakable diplomatic and security cooperative 
alliance. The U.S. foreign policy authorities should not forget 
that the abrupt reference to the North Korean-U.S. summit at 
this point could lead the United States to be fooled by the 
North Korean peace offensive.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 27 (YONHAP) -- The United States is 
considering a two-phased diplomatic normalization with North 
Korea starting with the opening of liaison offices, the ASAHI 
SHIMBUN reported Monday. 
  Quoting South Korean Government officials, ASAHI said the 
Clinton administration has notified Seoul that it plans to 
exchange liaison offices with North Korea if Pyongyang 
guarantees the transparency of its past, present and future 
nuclear activities and allows inspection of two undeclared sites 
critical to determining how much plutonium the North Koreans 
have stockpiled. 
  The United States would then be ready to relax trade 
restrictions against Pyongyang, change North Korea's status in 
the category of the "Trade With the Enemy Act" and promise 
financial assistance to change its outdated nuclear reactors to 
a much safer system, the paper said. For this transition, 
Washington may ask South Korea and Japan to chip in, according 
to ASAHI. 
  But the United States will demand that North Korea halt 
missile exports, improve human rights and renounce terrorism 
before it will establish ties with the communist state, it 
reported. 
  ASAHI noted that North Korea is likely to strongly oppose 
such a phased plan since it would increase barriers to full 
diplomatic normalization. 
  The White House is treading cautiously on normalizing 
relations because Congress, and some within the administration, 
still mistrusts North Korea. The growing pressure to address 
human rights conditions is another reason, ASAHI said.

  [Text] Seoul, June 27 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
ambassador for nuclear affairs will fly to Washington this week 
for bilateral and trilateral talks, including Japan, on the 
North Korean nuclear situation, a Foreign Ministry spokesman 
said Monday. 
  Ambassador Kim Sam-hun's visit precedes a third round of 
North Korea-U.S. high-level dialogue slated to open in Geneva 
after a one-year hiatus following the second round. 
  Kim is to meet with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert 
Gallucci, chief American delegate to the dialogue with North 
Korea, for bilateral consultations. 
  The meeting will be followed by a trilateral consultation 
including Yutaka Kawashima, director-general for Asian affairs 
at the Japanese Foreign Ministry, the spokesman said. 
  The three-way meeting is expected to address issues related 
to freezing North Korea's nuclear development program, 
recounting its past activities, and financial aid in switching 
the North's outdated nuclear system to safer light-water 
reactors.

  [Text] It has been learned that since the nuclear fuel 
that North Korea recently removed from its five-megawatt 
experimental nuclear reactor in Yongbyon is coated with the 
alloyed magnesium (Magnox), it may leak radiation within two 
years if North Korea uses its present method of preservation. 
  In a closed seminar marking the inauguration of the Atomic 
Energy Control Center held at the Plaza Hotel in Seoul on 24 
June, Professor Kim Pyong-ku, chief of the reactor development 
team of the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, noted that 
because the coating material Magnox is apt to erode in water, 
long-term preservation of Magnox-coated nuclear fuel in water -- 
North Korea uses this method -- may result in a leakage of 
radiation. He expressed his concerns about the problem as North 
Korea cannot but help reprocess the nuclear fuel rods within two 
years, and insisted that those nuclear fuel rods must be 
resealed and kept dry permanently or must be disposed of for 
good all under the supervision of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency.

for ending the armistice status and establishing a peace system 
between the North and the South (provisional title)". 
  On 27 June, a relevant high-ranking government official said 
that "the North-South basic agreement stipulated that `the North 
and the South shall make efforts to turn the armistice status 
into a peace system.' Based on this, the government decided to 
make a proposal to conclude an `agreement for ending the 
armistice status and establish a peace system.'" 
  This government policy is put forward on the basis of its 
judgment that at a time when a preliminary contact for a 
North-South summit is to be held and a North-South dialogue, 
including the summit, will likely be pushed ahead actively, and 
when North Korea-U.S. dialogue, including a third round of North 
Korea-U.S. high-level talks, which even envisages the 
establishment of diplomatic relations, is being accelerated, the 
present armistice system between the North and the South can 
hardly make the two sides coexist, and thus the turning of this 
system into a peace system is inevitable. 
  This official also noted that "The present Armistice 
Agreement prescribes that the agreement is effective until it is 
replaced with another agreement. Therefore, it is necessary to 
conclude a new agreement." Although North Korea demanded to the 
United States in the past that the Armistice Agreement be 
replaced with a peace agreement, North Korea did not put forward 
this proposal to the South side owing to differences in views 
between the two sides. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Berlin, June 27 (YONHAP) -- Choe Chong-nam, a 
representative of Hanchongnyon, the Federation of Student 
Councils in South Korea, left Berlin for Pyongyang last Friday, 
a source here said Monday. 
  An official at Pomchonghangnyon, the Pan-National Federation 
of Youth-Students for Unification of the Fatherland, said that 
Choe, 25, a horticulture major on temporary leave from Seoul 
National University, had left for Moscow aboard a (North) Korean 
Airways Flight from a German Airport. 
  Officials of Pomchonghangnyon, which arranged Choe's visit, 
saw him off at the airport, according to the source. 
  It is not yet known whether Choe has already arrived in 
Pyongyang via Moscow or if he is still in the Russian capital. 
  Pomchonghangnyon, the Joint Organization of South and North 
Korean Students Headquartered in Berlin, declined to comment on 
Choe's whereabouts, saying only that it will announce the 
relevant details in a few days. 
  Choe, at a press conference here last Friday, said he 
planned 
to stay in Pyongyang for a couple of weeks to meet with key 
officials including North Korean President Kim Il-song to convey 
Hanchongnyon's position on peace and unification on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Hanchongnyon has entrusted Choe with contacting Kim Il-song, 
political groups and social organizations, clarifying its 
opposition to unification through absorption, demanding that 
Seoul and Pyongyang implement the South-North basic agreement, 
and calling for the conclusion of a North Korean-U.S. peace 
accord and a package deal on the nuclear problem. 
  Choe will be the second representative of a South Korean 
student activists group to visit North Korea without government 
permission. Yim Su-kyong of Chongdaehyop, the defunct National 
Council of Student Representatives, visited the North Korean 
capital to participate in the Pyongyang Youth Festival from June 
30 to Aug. 15, 1989. 
  After returning through the truce village of Panmunjom, Yim 
was indicted and sentenced to five years' imprisonment. She was 
released under a special pardon on Dec. 24, 1992.

Yalu River Spring: North Korean Change Seen from Dandong, China"] 
<H5>  [8 May 94 pp 1-2] </H5>
  [Text] [Boxed item: If one goes to Dandong, China, Sinuiju 
looks close. The railway bridge linking Dandong and Sinuiju is 
shorter than the Han River Bridge. However, it cannot be crossed 
freely, and so feels much longer. The impressions of the two 
cities seen from the Yalu River are more dissimilar. The Dandong 
side overflows with the vitality of openness; the Sinuiju side 
is desolate. However, it could be sensed that on the Sinuiju 
side too, a soft spring breeze is secretly blowing. This article 
will be published in five installments, showing the North Korean 
[NK] situation as perceived from Dandong and a view of the life 
of Koreans living there.] 
  Going to Dandong, China's gateway to NK facing Sinuiju 
across 
the Yalu River, one can sense here and there NK's internal 
changes and troubles. 
  First of all, going to the Dandong Maritime Customs, one can 
see the "bundled procession of openness" entering NK. Every day 
at about 10 AM and 3 PM, this place bustles with bundle-carrying 
peddlers trying to get on the border bus going to Sinuiju from 
Dandong. 
  The enormous gunny sacks on which they sit contain various 
daily necessities, from garments, tobacco, alcohol, spices, and 
pastries to shoes, umbrellas, glasses, fountain pens, and color 
film. There are even those carrying black-and-white televisions. 
In the "Choson Store," located beside the maritime customs 
office which deals with the peddlers, are displayed Lotte gum, 
Kent cigarettes, and even Coca-Cola. 
  The number of people coming and going by the border bus 
between Dandong and Sinuiju alone are estimated to exceed 50 
thousand annually. Designated by China in 1992 as a border 
economic-cooperation zone, Dandong is China's greatest 
border-trade city, and is ambitiously promoting development. The 
peddlers are messengers carrying the winds of openness to NK in 
their bundles. On the Yalu Railway Bridge, crossing by cargo 
trucks is quite frequent. On the trucks coming out of NK were 
loaded scrap iron and marine products; on trucks entering NK 
from China, black-and-white televisions, machinery, etc. Cargo 
trucks too were transporting the winds of openness. One owner (a 
Korean) of a restaurant on the banks of the Yalu, with NK truck 
drivers as regular customers, said that if they are alone, they 
often relax, singing Korean songs. "There are even North Koreans 
who ask: wouldn't things get better than they are now if Korea 
were unified, even by shooting a gun," conveyed another owner of 
a Korean restaurant frequented by North Koreans. 
  Being adjacent to NK, Dandong sees much coming and going by 
North Koreans. There are those who come out, issued a passport 
ostensibly for the purpose of visiting relatives, and there are 
those who, simply issued a river-crossing pass, come across the 
river for only a little while. Of these, there are those who do 
not return even though their authorized period expires. 
  One young NK woman (22) working in a Dandong karaoke bar 
confessed that, leaving NK with a three-month passport for 
visiting relatives last February, she has remained until now 
without returning. This young woman, who claims to have 
graduated from a combined middle and high school in Pyongyang, 
added, "Returning has now become difficult because of fines." 
  In Dandong there are two karaoke establishments directly 
managed by NK. The place called Pyongyang Kwan is managed by the 
Taedong River Trade Corporation; the place called Pyongyang 
Yongnamsanjang, by the Potong River Trade Corporation. Young 
women sent from Pyongyang work there. These are places where one 
can really feel the signs of change in NK. 
  Pyongyang Yongnamsanjang also plays South Korean [SK] songs, 
but Pyongyang Kwan only plays modern NK and Chinese songs. 
Pyongyang Kwan too reportedly plans to play SK songs soon. Of 
course, this is for drawing SK customers, who have been actively 
advancing into Dandong of late. When South Koreans stop by this 
place, young Pyongyang women give them bouquets of flowers, 
singing in chorus the NK song, "Welcome, Compatriots 
[Pangapsumnida Tongpo Yorobun]." 
  "For NK, opening sooner or later will become unavoidable due 
to gradual internal change," said one Korean resident of China 
(35, a trade company employee) claiming to have visited NK on 
business over ten times. "Although not visible to the eye, when 
it reaches a fixed limit, internal change will gain a power 
which cannot be turned back." 
<H5>  [9 May 94 pp 1-2] </H5>
  [Excerpts] Spring ripens in May, even on the Yalu River. 
From the early morning, Dandong's Yalu River Park bustles with 
people coming out to enjoy their fill of the refreshing spring 
breeze blowing down from distant Paektu Mountain. [passage 
omitted] 
  Across the river, the scene in Sinuiju is different. In an 
amusement park situated directly across from the Yalu River 
Park, there is hardly a sign of anyone and the amusement-park 
machinery is motionless. They are said to have been operated 
only once: a little while ago for NK's greatest holiday, Kim 
Il-song's birthday. Next to the amusement park is a restaurant, 
the Amnokkanggak. Compared to its large scale, customers are 
almost nonexistent, making it look wretched. 
  The nighttime scene is even more contrasting. From the 
Dandong-side river bank, with its newly-created city sections, 
overflows the noisy excitement of a port city experiencing an 
openness boom. The Sinuiju-side river bank, however, is hidden 
by the darkness of night. Only the light of a passenger ship 
going north on a tributary of the Yalu River makes one realize 
that Sinuiju too is a port city. 
  The uniquely NK sound of a bellicose woman's voice flowing 
out of a loudspeaker late into the night gives one a feeling of 
brutality. Unable to make out what was being said, we asked a 
Dandong official. He said the residents of Sinuiju appeared to 
be holding nighttime emergency training. This year, resident 
emergency training had increased markedly, he said. 
  There being no border on the Yalu (Chinese-NK common 
ownership), one can get on a boat and go right up to the bank on 
the Sinuiju side. If one speaks to the people visible on the 
river bank, they motion for one to go back without so much as an 
answer. When one views both sides of the Yalu River from a boat, 
in a glance one can see the development of an open China and the 
backwardness of a closed NK. 
  The Dandong-side river bank is cleanly decorated with modern 
buildings, and vehicles frequently go back and forth. On the 
Sinuiju-side river bank, there are many structures built during 
the Japanese occupation, and no smoke coming from factory 
smokestacks. The explanation of our ethnic Korean guide, that 
previously Sinuiju had been a much more prosperous city than 
Dandong, deepened our frustration. 
  The midpoint of the Yalu River Railroad Bridge, the great 
artery of traffic between China and NK, is the frontier. With 
the help of a Dandong official, we were able to go right up to 
the border, guided by a Chinese guard. [passage omitted] 
  This bridge, about 960 m in length, has a railway on one 
side 
and a road on the other. Although traffic by cargo trains and 
trucks was comparatively frequent, passenger cars were rare. The 
passenger train between Beijing and Pyongyang makes about four 
round trips a week, explained the Chinese guard. 
  South of this bridge is another bridge broken by the aerial 
bombing of U.S. forces during the Korean war. Only the half on 
the Chinese side remains. Repair and refurbishing of this place 
is now in full swing for developing it into a tourist resort. 
They are painting it again and are building restaurants and 
souvenir shops on one side of the bridge, taking aim at SK 
tourists. 
  Many South Koreans who lost their homes in the North come to 
visit Dandong. They hope to possibly hear news of family they 
left behind in NK, since North Koreans frequently come and go 
here. Many NK-SK separated families get in contact with each 
other and meet in Dandong, reports Deputy Mayor of Dandong Wang 
Jun-lian (female). City officials appear to be unofficially 
working on behalf of separated families, helping them to get in 
contact and meet. 
  Going north along the Yalu River from Dandong, a little over 
two hours by car, one reaches Supung Dam. On the road to Supung 
Dam, we saw NK soldiers catching fish with baskets in a 
tributary of the Yalu. When we tried to start a conversation, 
saying, "We're from South Korea," they packed up their baskets 
and disappeared without replying. 
  Going to the upper reaches of the Yalu River, there is a NK 
island across what is now a stream no more than two-to-three 
meters wide. Therefore, smuggling is reportedly rampant. 
Although there are also escapees from NK, they immediately go 
into hiding in Shenyang and other places in the interior. So 
they say it is not clear from here how many there are. 
  Arriving at the shore of Lake Supung, we got on a boat. As 
we 
came close to the dam, two NK soldiers got in a boat and came 
out to observe us. After awhile, apparently concluding that 
nothing was wrong, the NK soldiers even waved toward our boat. 
The spring flowers near Supung Dam were in full bloom. 
<H5>  [10 May 94 p 5] </H5>
  [Excerpts] Located on a street called Luidaogou in the 
outskirts of Dandong, the Pyongyang Kwan is both karaoke hall 
and Korean restaurant. It was opened in January 1993, under the 
direct management of Pyongyang's Taedong River Public Service 
Corporation, Limited (normally called the Taedong River Trade 
Corporation). The first floor is used as a restaurant and the 
second floor as a karaoke bar, but when a "special customer" 
comes, he is treated to dinner in a separate room on the second 
floor. 
  The atmosphere of the karaoke bar is not much different from 
one in SK. People sing and dance to the music in front of a 
large screen beneath brilliant Saiki lights. [passage omitted] 
  Together with the NK songs and music, the background screens 
all show scenes of NK landscapes and events. Since Japanese 
subtitles come on with the words of the songs, it appears a 
Japanese company was commissioned to manufacture [the programs]. 
With almost every song, bathing or half-naked young women 
appear, adopting sensuous poses. 
  Disco Time [as published] is also interspersed throughout. 
Then, noisy pop songs blare. At this time only, the young 
Pyongyang women move their bodies to the "enemy Yankee" music. 
There are seven young women in their early twenties, Pyongyang 
graduates of combined middle and high schools and above, who 
were sent to the Pyongyang Kwan when it opened last year. 
  They all have well-featured faces and conduct themselves in 
a 
refined manner. Unlike their soft exterior, ideologically they 
are rock solid. [passage omitted] 
  Asking one young woman, "How can you do something like 
karaoke in NK?" she answered openly, "We came to earn dollars." 
We also asked, "Do you know who the late Pastor Mun Ik-hwan or 
Miss Im Su-kyong are?" she answered, "I know a lot about them." 
However, when we asked if she knew of the KAL bombing criminal 
Kim Hyon-hui, she said, "I don't know of her." 
  The young women sing and dance with customers. However, they 
do not join with them in drinking, nor do they accept tips. 
Their personal lives too seem to be quite strictly controlled. 
They are said to live together in a dormitory next to the 
Pyongyang Kwan and work on ideological study at every 
opportunity under the supervision of a woman in her forties sent 
from Pyongyang. The women's work periods are in one-year units. 
When a year goes by, they must receive reeducation in Pyongyang 
before coming back out. This year too, from January through 
March, the Pyongyang Kwan was closed for business because of the 
women receiving education. It reopened on April 1st. It is said 
that there are also women who are unable to return to this place 
after entering Pyongyang. This fact too is probably one of the 
things controlling the women's behavior. 
  Up through the end of last year, the Pyongyang Kwan also 
played SK songs, but they are prohibited this year. One woman 
hinted, "It is planned to play SK songs again if the atmosphere 
improves." In light of this, it appears the recent unbending NK 
mood resulting from the nuclear issue reaches even this place. 
"This year the Pyongyang Karaoke halls in Beijing and other 
places were all closed," the woman said. 
  The main customers of this place are employees of NK trade 
corporations, who require entertainment for business, and SK 
tourists. Although not as clearly seen as the many SK tourists, 
the young women's interest in SK is high. "The women frequently 
ask in secret that I get them SK women's magazines," reports one 
member of a SK trading firm who generally has his meals here 
while in Dandong. 
  There is another combined karaoke hall and Korean restaurant 
in Dandong, directly managed by Pyongyang's Potong River Trade 
Corporation. Located in downtown Dandong, the Pyongyang 
Yongnamsanjang has a competitive relationship with the Pyongyang 
Kwan. Although last year there were more customers here than at 
the Pyongyang Kwan, the women sent from Pyongyang were called 
back at the beginning of this year. During their absence, the 
place is said to be dead. This may be the reason they will still 
play SK songs if requested. 
  The Pyongyang women who were here last year were so 
beautiful 
that stories were circulating about them. They seem to have 
caused some problem, say Korean residents of Dandong. Of the 
three women here now, one is from Yonbyon. The two others are 
from Pyongyang, but they left NK on passports for visiting 
relatives and got work here. 
<H5>  [11 May 94 p 5] </H5>
  [Text]The area around the double road of 1 ma-ro and 2 
ma-ro, located some two hundred meters away from the Dandong 
Maritime Customs), is a place similar to SK's Namdaemun Market. 
Over 20 businesses with signs reading, "Choson Store," are 
crowded together. Most are clothing stores, with an occasional 
general store. This place provides articles to NK peddlers. 
Around it here and there are located "Choson Restaurants." 
  There are also a few Korean stores in the vicinity of the 
maritime customs office. Most of the people running the Korean 
stores are Hwagyo [ethnic Chinese residents of Korea]. Being 
Chinese who used to live in NK, many have family still there. 
  Going to the Korean stores in the evening, one sees people 
putting clothing and various daily necessities into enormous 
gunny sacks. They are preparing articles to hand over to the 
peddlers who will arrive the next day. These Korean stores bring 
articles directly from factories in Shenyang and Dalian, and 
hand them over to the peddlers. 
  The articles handled by the Korean stores are very cheap. 
This is because if they are not cheap, they do not sell well in 
NK. A popular item is clothing of the lowest grade, which sells 
for 10-20 Chinese yuan (about 1-2 thousand won [W]). As for 
tobacco, the brand "Hongzuima [Hongjoma in Korean]," the 
cheapest in China at 4 jue (about W40), is stored and sold in 
heaps. The Korean stores doing business with peddlers are also 
used by North Koreans as secret contact points. We were looking 
at a Korean store near the maritime customs office when a couple 
in their forties wearing Kim Il-song badges approached us and 
asked, "Are you South Korean?" Then, showing us a picture and 
letter from Kwangju, South Cholla Province, they asked, "This is 
a relative. Please find and contact him for us." 
  This couple, claiming to live in Sinuiju, added that they 
had 
come to Dandong on several occasions and asked around, but had 
been unable to make contact. When in the middle of talking a man 
in his thirties arrived on a NK truck and entered the store, the 
couple hastily took back the letter and picture and disappeared. 
  The peddlers make a good profit taking cheap goods into NK. 
Cloth going for 10-20 Chinese yuan sells for W300-400 in NK 
money; tobacco going for four jue in Chinese money sells for W10 
in NK money. The official exchange rate is 0.7 NK won to one 
Chinese yuan. In actuality, however, one Chinese yuan goes for 
10 NK won. Given this fact, the peddlers are making more than 
double their costs in profits. 
  However, since NK money is rather useless, they return to 
Dandong having bought gold dust, marine products, etc. These 
peddlers are said to make over 1 thousand Chinese yuan each time 
they make such a trip between Dandong and NK. When compared to 
the approximately 300-yuan monthly pay of the average Chinese 
workers, it can be seen that this is a well-paying trade. 
  Just because they are mere peddlers does not mean that 
anyone 
can do it. This is because not just anybody can go in and out of 
closed NK. Mr. Hwang (60), a Korean living in Dandong with 
experience as a peddler, said, "It is only possible if you have 
strong backing in NK or pay bribes." Of course, one's class 
background must be good. 
  When I took a picture in front of the maritime customs 
office 
where peddlers were gathered, a woman who appeared to be in her 
forties shouted, "Isn't this a SK spy?" Afterwards, many people 
started talking: "If you're going to take a picture, take one of 
a good place. Why take one here?"; "Go get a city permit." Some 
robust young men in their twenties even came up and pushed aside 
my camera. 
  This year, going back and forth between Dandong and Sinuiju 
has become more difficult. Even last year, one could get a 
river-crossing pass on demand. This year, however, 
river-crossing passes were restricted to one per year. NK is 
rumored to have requested this of China. One Korean living in 
Dandong, familiar with NK circumstances, thinks such measures 
are only temporary. 
  They believe if only the nuclear issue is concluded, NK will 
be the first to hasten opening. They conclude that the Kim 
Chong-il succession will be in danger if Kim Il-song does not 
achieve openness in his lifetime. Rumors are even circulating 
among Korean residents here that Kim Chong-il recently stopped 
by Sinuiju and, gazing at the Dandong side, give instructions to 
"make Sinuiju more developed than Dandong." With the restriction 
on river-crossing passes, counterfeit river-crossing passes are 
rampant. 
  Peddlers are strictly controlled when they enter Sinuiju. If 
they want to go to another area, they must be issued another 
pass and they must not tell people what they have seen and heard 
in China. Even so, the spring breeze of openness goes hidden in 
their bundles. 
<H5>  [12 May 94 p 6] </H5>
  [Text] Dandong is the Chinese city closest to NK's 
Pyongyang. There is even clear reception of NK television 
broadcasts. It is not very interesting due to the daily-repeated 
litany of the idolization of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il, but 
Korean residents longing to hear the language of their home 
frequently turn the channel to it in the evening. There are more 
than a few among the Koreans here who say, "Honestly, 
emotionally I still feel closer to the NK side." 
  Compared with Yonbyon and other places, the SK wind started 
blowing late in the Dandong Korean community; it appears this 
was not unrelated to "psychological distance." Although late in 
arriving, the SK wind in the Korean community here has special 
significance: it can have a more direct influence on NK. Change 
in the Korean community here is more distinct among the younger 
generation. Having even graduated from college in Beijing, Ms. 
Yu (30, female), a second generation Korean, is part of the 
elite, but up until two years ago, she could speak almost no 
Korean. Her marriage too was with a Chinese man. However, 
feeling a need to learn Korean while working at a trade company, 
she can now sufficiently understand and make herself understood 
in Korean. Yu's Chinese husband became an agent for a SK 
businessman, a result of her being Korean. 
  Ethnic Korean students crowding into "Korean schools" is a 
similar phenomenon. It is said that up until several years ago, 
many ethnic students attended Chinese schools beginning with 
elementary school, believing that if they were going to live in 
China, they would have to learn Chinese. Things have changed. 
Parents now teach their children Korean beginning in the home 
when they are young. 
  In the Dandong area, there are 12 elementary schools and 
five 
middle schools. In the city of Dandong, there is only one Korean 
school. In the Dandong Municipal Korean School, preschool, 
elementary, and middle school classes are all in one building. 
There are 290 students, including 120 in high school. The 
reason there are so many high school students is that this is 
the only Korean high school and all the students crowd into it. 
  "Only two years ago, there weren't even half the students 
there are now. But the number of students rapidly increased 
after SK and China established diplomatic relations," said 
school principle Ho Hyong-haeng (56). "In two to three years, 
the total number of students will increase to 700 or 800." Even 
now, however, they are so short of classrooms that they have to 
use a double-shift school system, and extremely insufficient 
finances are worrisome, he said. 
  The Korean preschool groundbreaking ceremony held April 27th 
on an open lot at an apartment complex on the bank of the Yalu 
River was a festive occasion for Dandong Koreans. Preschool 
students in rainbow-stripped clothes sang children's songs in 
rhythm and acted cute. Elderly women dressed in traditional 
clothing sang folk songs, merrily dancing the shoulder dance. 
Many officials of the municipal government as well as leading 
figures in the Korean community participated. Dandong television 
and newspapers also covered and reported the day's event. 
  The construction of this preschool was originally pursued by 
leading figures in the Korean community to resolve the Dandong 
Municipal Korean School's classroom shortage. Last year they 
were provided by the municipal authorities with a 240-pyong 
[approximately 948.96 sq. yds.] plot as a building site. They 
were unable to begin construction, however, because they could 
not provide for construction expenses. Hearing of their 
difficult circumstances, the Hanguk Sonmyonghoe gave them $50 
thousand in support as part of its "Bread of Love" project. 
Thus, they came to hold this day's groundbreaking ceremony. 
  "It is frustrating that even though we give the "bread of 
love" to hungry children in distant Africa, we are unable to 
give it to hungry children in nearby NK. Hearing that they were 
trying to build a Korean preschool in Dandong, which is adjacent 
to NK, we gave them construction-cost support, hoping the arms 
of love could be extended to the children of NK as well," 
explained Songmyonghoe president Yi Yun-ku. 
  After completing the groundbreaking ceremony, Yi and Kim 
Hye-ja, a television personality accompanying him, visited the 
Dandong Municipal Korean School. Only NK cartoon books were 
on the preschool bookshelves. When they asked the reason the 
preschoolers wore red neckties, the [teachers] readily replied, 
"To carry on the spirit of their revolutionary elders." The 
influence of NK was felt everywhere. 
  It was the same with the older, high school juniors. When 
told, "If you are curious about something concerning SK, just 
ask," one student asked, "Is there freedom in SK?" However, when 
Yi's party left the school, this student ran out to them. 
"Actually, I've been to SK with my father, " he revealed, 
excusing his previous behavior, "I was just confused a while 
ago." 
  "Korean youth are experiencing inner conflict. Even though 
they know they have nothing more for which to hope from NK, 
emotionally they are still uncomfortable with SK. Given these 
emotional considerations, investment in their education is 
needed. Korean youth could become an important medium in the 
unification of the Fatherland," said a Korean who had been their 
guide.

  [Text] Seoul, June 25 (YONHAP) -- Pusan subway workers went 
on strike Saturday morning, joining their colleagues in Seoul 
and on the National Railroads and worsening the country's 
transportation woes on the third day of the work stoppage. 
  On the national railroads, sharply reduced train runs 
continued for the third consecutive day as only 1,161 striking 
workers, or 16.3 percent of the roughly 7,000 strikers, had 
notified the government as of 10:00 A.M. Saturday of their 
intention to return to work. 
  To normalize train operations, the Korean National Railroad 
will utilize some 100 novice locomotive engineers starting next 
Monday and train more engineers next month, depending on the 
number of returning strikers, Korean National Railroad 
Administrator Choe Hun told reporters. 
  He added that his office has decided to sack 210 striking 
engineers for their roles in the walkout. 
  In view of the strike's grave effect on exports, Choe said, 
the emergency railroad transportation program would put emphasis 
on hauling cement, oil and containers. 
  He stressed that he has no intention of talking with 
Chongihyop, the private "unregistered" union of locomotive 
engineers which is leading the strike, to brush off the attempt 
by "some impure-minded engineers to resolve the problem 
illegally." 
  Chongihyop has asked the Korean National Church Council to 
mediate between it and the Korean National Railroad, a request 
that the council has accepted. 
  On the other hand, Seoul subway lines managed to maintain 
near-normal operations thanks to the utilization of 217 
non-striking engineers. But on lines run by the Korean National 
Railroad, including Seoul-Inchon and Seoul-Suwon, train run 
intervals were between 30 and 40 minutes. 
  As of 11:00 A.M., 2,704 striking workers, 34 percent of the 
8,724 Seoul subway workers, had returned to their jobs, up some 
1,000 from Friday. But only 30 engineers had returned, or 3 
percent of the 1,300 engineers who joined in the strike.

  [Text] On 26 June, the Office of National Railroads [ONR] 
disclosed its plan to mete out strong disciplinary measures-- 
including the deprivation of their status or dismissal from 
their posts--on the members of the National Council of 
Locomotive Engineers [NCLE] who have not yet reported to their 
work after the deadline set for their return has passed, by 
classifying them into several categories, depending on the 
degree of their active participation in the strike. The ONR has 
also decided to dismiss some 500 employees, including about 210 
who have not yet returned to work after they were released by 
the police with a warning, and the executives of the NCLE 
headquarters and its 20 nation-wide branch offices.

  [Text] Seoul, June 26 (YONHAP) -- The government and ruling 
Democratic Liberal Party decided at a joint meeting Sunday to 
cope sternly with the illegal strike by railroad and subway 
workers, saying that the ongoing strike takes the form of 
political struggle rather than pure labor dispute. 
  Police, meanwhile, raided a church hall in downtown Seoul 
Sunday afternoon to haul away over 250 striking railroad workers 
who have been staging a sit-in at the hall since they began the 
strike last Thursday. 
  It was the second time in a day that the police raided 
sit-in 
protest sites of striking railroad and subway workers. Earlier 
in the day, police broke into Kyung Hee and Dongduck Women's 
Universities to arrest and disperse striking workers and 
sympathizing students. 
  In the joint government and ruling party meeting, the two 
sides agreed to come up with measures to fundamentally head off 
the possibility of railroad paralysis while trying to mobilize 
military manpower to minimize adverse impacts of the ongoing 
strike on the country's economy. 
  The joint meeting attended by relevant high-ranking 
government officials and lawmakers including O Myong, 
transportation minister; Nam Chae-hui, labor minister; Yi 
Won-chong, Seoul city mayor; and Yi Se-ki, the ruling DLP's 
chief policymaker, also agreed to sternly deal with any sympathy 
strikes which the National Council of Union Representatives or 
Chonnodae encompassing the nation's major manufacturing 
companies threatened to stage Monday. 
  Transportation Minister O said in the meeting "We expect the 
ongoing strike to enter a recovering phase starting tomorrow," 
adding the ministry will make it sure that the strategic 
material, in particular, be moved without fail. 
  "As of 10 A.M. this morning, the ministry finished accepting 
applications of the striking workers to return to their works 
and the ministry will not extend the deadline," said O. "From 
now on, the ministry will continue to accept those who want to 
return to their works but they should be subjected to 
disadvantages in personnel management."

  [Text] Seoul, June 27 (YONHAP) -- Railroad transportation 
will return to near normalcy toward the end of the week as more 
and more striking engineers resume their positions. 
  Strikers who had returned to work or made known their 
intention to do so as of 9:00 A.M. Monday, the fifth day of the 
strike, numbered 5,755, or 88 percent of all 6,540 people. They 
included 2, 766 locomotive engineers and 1,536 assistant 
engineers, 69 percent, according to the Korean National Railroad 
(KNR). 
  To compel the remaining strikers to take up their posts, the 
KNR warned that those failing to return by 10:00 A.M. Monday 
will be sacked. It estimates that some 900 engineers and 
assistant engineers will not return by the deadline. 
  As more engineers report back to work, the KNR will increase 
operations of commuter trains linked with the Seoul subway to 
66.9 percent of the normal level by the weekend, while 
normalizing cargo train runs for such important freight as 
containers of export and import goods, oil and cement. 
  To fill the openings left by those who remain on strike, the 
KNR will utilize some 500 retired and stand-by engineers to 
increase passenger and cargo transportation to 90 percent of the 
normal level and normalize commuter train operations in the 
capital area by mid- July. 
  The KNR has already decided to sack 108 strikers, including 
28 members of Chongihyop, an unregistered union of locomotive 
engineers which led the strike, and 70 engineers who abandoned 
their trains or took with them engine parts when the walkout 
started. 
  Some 360 servicemen assigned to the KNR during the strike 
will be employed as engineers and to perform other jobs after 
training, if they so desire after discharge from military 
service, the KNR said. 
  The KNR will also cite 539 workers who refused to strike and 
who persuaded many strikers to return to work. 
  In a related development, organized workers of business 
groups such as Hyundai and Daewoo showed no signs of initiating 
a walkout Monday, the day Chonnodae (the National Council of 
Union Representatives) set for a nationwide strike of its member 
unions in sympathy with railroad and subway workers. 
  As a result, the railroad and subway strikes are not likely 
to develop into a nationwide stoppage at business groups. 
  According to the Labor Ministry, some of the 26 big company 
unions belonging to Chonnodae have already refused to follow 
Chonnodae's nationwide strike plan, though organized workers of 
Hyundai Heavy Industries began a partial strike Monday morning.

  [Text] Phnom Penh 25 Jun (AKP) -- "The Cambodian People's 
Party (CPP) categorically opposes all attempts by the Khmer 
Rouge [KR] to abolish the constitution of the Kingdom of 
Cambodia in their demand for the dismantling of the National 
Assembly and the royal government. The Khmer Rouge has demanded 
the establishment of a new government that also comprises their 
representatives," says a statement made public on Wednesday by 
this party. 
  "The CPP, the statement continues, considers the 
constitution 
of the Kingdom of Cambodia a precious acquisition of the entire 
Cambodian nation and also the international community, who has 
provided considerable and sincere assistance. 
  "This precious acquisition has also been obtained through 
His 
Majesty Norodom Sihanouk, very revered leader," stresses the 
statement. 
  "If we make concessions to those responsible for the 
genocide 
and those who torpedoed the Paris agreement, boycotted and 
sabotaged the elections, and who are now destroying the country, 
this would be serious contempt of the Cambodian people and a big 
blow to the results of the UN operations in Cambodia." 
  The CPP also (?says) that it will stick to its position now 
and in the future. Future generations of Cambodians also have 
the duty to value this achievement. The CPP demands that the 
settlement of all Cambodia's current problems be in accordance 
with the country's constitution. 
  The CPP eagerly supports the idea advanced by the United 
States, the other governments, and the public the world over. 
This concerns the establishment of an office to carry out 
research on the crimes committed by the Khmer Rouge against the 
Cambodian people and foreign nationals for the preparation of 
files so that court proceedings could be instituted.

  [Text] Phnom Penh AKP June 24 -- The Cambodian two 
co-premiers Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun 
Sen, who led a delegation of the Royal Government of Cambodia to 
pay a two-day state visit to Indonesia arrived here on Wednesday. 
  The visit, which was made at the invitation of Indonesian 
President Suharto, concluded on June 22 with the following joint 
statement: 
  "During the visit, the first and second prime ministers of 
the Royal Government of Cambodia and their delegation laid a 
wreath at the Kalibata heroes cemetery, and visited several 
places of cultural and historical significance. 
  "First Prime Minister and Princess Norodom Marie Ranariddh 
and Second Prime Minister and Madame Lok Chumteav Hun Sen paid a 
courtesy call on His Excellency Vice President and Mrs. Try 
Sutrisno. 
  "President Suharto, president of the Republic of Indonesia, 
and the first and second prime ministers of the Royal Government 
of Cambodia had a very useful exchange of views covering a wide 
range of bilateral, regional and international issues of mutual 
interest. The meeting was held in an atmosphere of friendship, 
mutual understanding and cooperation. At the meeting, the first 
and second prime ministers of the Royal Government of Cambodia 
conveyed to His Excellency President Suharto the best wishes of 
His Majesty Preah Bat Samdech Preah Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, 
king of Cambodia. His Excellency President Suharto expressed his 
gratitude and conveyed, through the first and second prime 
ministers of the Royal Government of Cambodia, the best wishes 
for the health, longevity and happiness of His Majesty the king 
of Cambodia. 
  "Two separate meetings on political, security and economic 
matters were simultaneously conducted during parallel talks 
between the two official parties at ministerial level. At the 
meeting on political and security matters, the Indonesian side 
was led by Minister for Foreign Affairs ad interim, H.E. Mr. 
Susilo Sudarman and the Cambodian side was led by Deputy Prime 
Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs and International 
Cooperation, HRH Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut. At the 
meeting on economic matters, the Indonesia side was led by 
Minister for Trade, H.E. Dr. Satrio Budiarjo Joedono, and the 
Cambodian side was led by Minister for Agricultural, Forestry 
and Fishery, H.E. Mr. Kong Sam-ol. The two sides briefed each 
other on the political, security and economic developments of 
their respective countries and exchanged views on how to further 
promote bilateral cooperation. 
  "The two sides expressed their satisfaction regarding the 
devlopment of bilateral relations between the two countries and 
acknowledged the existing potentials for broader cooperation in 
the fields of commerce, tourism, agriculture, rural development, 
environment, public health, education culture and infrastructure. 
  "Following the parallel talks, the two sides signed an 
agreement between the government of the Republic of Indonesia 
and the Royal Government of Cambodia on economic and technical 
cooperation which signifies the new era of Indonesia-Cambodia 
relationship. 
  "The Indonesian side expressed that it highly valued the 
important role and continuing efforts undertaken by His Majesty 
Preah Bat Samdech Preah Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king of 
Cambodia, for national reconciliation and in favor of bringing 
about peace, stability and progress for the Cambodian people. 
The Indonesian side highly appreciated the efforts of His 
Majesty Preah Bat Samdech Preah Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king 
of Cambodia, in order to consolidate and develop even further 
the traditional relations of friendship and cooperation existing 
between the peoples of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Republic 
of Indonesia. The Indonesian side expressed its firm belief 
that under the personal and clear- sighted leadership of His 
Majesty Preah Bat Samdech Preah Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king 
of Cambodia, the people of Cambodia will successfully build an 
independent, peaceful, neutral and prosperous Cambodia. 
  "The Cambodian side expressed its deep gratitude to the 
government and to the people of Indonesia for their firm, 
generous and active support to the peace process in Cambodia 
both as a member of ASEAN and individually, in particular for 
Indonesia's initiative in organizing a series of Jakarta 
informal meetings (JIM) and the important role played by 
Indonesia as co-chairman of the historical and successful Paris 
international conference on Cambodia (PICC), the sending to 
Cambodia of the valiant Indonesian peace- keeping operations 
contingent in the framework of UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority 
in Cambodia] and the valuable contribution for the 
rehabilitation and reconstruction of Cambodia. 
  "The Indonesian side expressed its appreciation to the 
restoration of the neutral, independent and sovereign status of 
Cambodia within its territorial integrity, as provided for in 
the Paris agreements on a comprehensive political settlement of 
the Cambodia conflict signed in Paris on October 23rd 1991 and 
reiterated its firm support to the Royal Government of Cambodia 
which was established as a result of free and fair general 
elections, under international supervision held in May 1993. 
  "The two sides noted with satisfaction the successful 
outcome 
of the 11th conference of the non-aligned countries held 
recently in Cairo. Cambodia, one of the members of the 
non-aligned movement, calls on Indonesia, as president of the 
movement, to strengthen and highten the role of the non-aligned 
movement. It is convinced of the movement's success."

  [Text] No buck-toothed guys have charged Cambodian papers 
printed in the West of violating the press law. Not just those 
printed in the West, even the Thai newspapers have spread so 
much divisive news to sow dissension among Cambodians without 
even an iota of truth. For example, they have claimed that 
Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut and His Excellency Sam Rangsi 
would resign their government portfolios if the Khmer Rouge were 
declared outlaws. 
  Are the Khmer Rouge related in any way to His Highness 
Norodom Sirivut and His Excellency Sam Rangsi? Are they their 
fathers-in-law or what? 
  Although they have published such a blatant falsehood, no 
buck-toothed people dare accuse them of day-dreaming. Maybe 
these buck-toothed guys are too buck-toothed to do something 
normal persons would do.

    [Editorial Report] The 4 June edition of MATICHON on page 
4 carried a report quoting Battambang Deputy Governor Serei 
Kosal as saying that government forces are capable of driving 
the Khmer Rouge [KR] out of Battambang Province. He noted that 
government forces--spearheaded by paramilitary police--had 
driven the Khmer Rouge out of Svay Sa, 60 kilometers south of 
Battambang. Kosal also said that "if government forces are 
given the order to retake Pailin, they could do so within two 
days." He added that government units are being reinforced, 
noting that Khmer Rouge strength around Pailin has been 
exaggerated and that the Khmer Rouge had lost 300 troops in 
their recapture of Pailin in April.

forward along the paths chosen by their countries. They remain 
(?unwavering in the face of new changes) and are confident in 
their revolutions amidst the changing currents of history. I am 
confident that the relations of friendship and cooperation 
between our two countries will be continuously developed and

  [Text] Vientiane, June 24 (KPL) -- The major donors and 
international aid institutions heaped praise on the Lao 
government's recent economic performance yesterday at a UNDP 
[United Nations Development Program] round-table conference to 
launch a far-reaching aid programme which will carry over into 
the next century, said a UNDP information letter issued in 
Geneva on June 22. 
  According to the letter, singling out the success of 
Vientiane's fiscal and monetary reform plan (begun in 1986), 
which has achieved single digit inflation, a much reduced trade 
deficit, and control over foreign debt payments, the donors 
urged the Lao government to press on with the pace of economic 
change and aim for rapid development. 
  The Lao government, which was represented by Khamphoui 
Keoboualapha, deputy prime minister, announced that it would 
increase the rate of public investment to 14 per cent of GDP by 
2000 in a bid to radically overhaul the country's poor 
infrastructure and prepare the economy for full-blooded regional 
integration. 
  As part of the Public Investment Programme (PIP) - which is 
to be backed by donors to the tune of up to U.S. dollars 1.4 
billion - the Lao government will irrigate more than 50,000 
hectares of unused land, plant 100,000 hectares of forest, and 
build 1,500 km of road. 
  In addition, a full-scale hydro-electric project is to go 
ahead which is planned to earn substantial foreign revenues 
through power export to Thailand and Vietnam, among other 
neighbours. 
  Donors agreed that the recent opening of the Mittaphap 
(Friendship) Bridge linking Laos to Thailand across the Mekong 
River along the growing tide of foreign investment pledges had 
all but guaranteed continuation of the country's healthy growth 
rates (7.5 per cent since 1989) for the next few years. 
  Among the congratulations for the boldness of the Lao reform 
programme, however, donors warned the Lao government that it 
should not base its plans on growth for the sake of growth but 
should work for a higher calibre of development. 
  It was also noted that least developed countries found it 
easier to achieve high growth rates than more sophisticated 
economies and that Laos had a particularly long way to go before 
its population could taste the fruits of a modern economy. 
  In his address to the donors, Deputy Prime Minister 
Khamphoui 
recognized that his country still suffered from poor social 
conditions: `national income (less than U.S. 300) is still very 
low. Agricultural production is still dependent on the mercy of 
nature. Ethnic groups in the mountainous areas live on 
practising slash-and-burn cultivation -- a practice that 
destroys forest areas of hundreds of thousands of hectares a 
year,' he said. 
  Along with a scheme to protect the environment, the 
government would invest significant donor-back sums to improve 
the country's education and health soctors, he said. Resources 
would also be channelled into a comprehensive training programme 
to modernize the workforce. And the government would strengthen 
its opium-eradication programme aiming to wipe out production of 
the drug by the year 2000. 
  The thrust, however, of the six-year reform and 
restructuring 
programme would be to develop Laos' market economy and diversify 
the country's rapidly growing export base. The Lao government 
and donors agreed that the country should build on its success 
in attracting foreign investment (U.S. dollars 126 million in 
1993 and over U.S. dollars 500 million in pledges) by updating 
the country's commercial law system and rationalizing its tariff 
structure. 
  If the PIP fulfilled its ambitious targets-- a plausible 
objective according to the experts at the meeting. Laos would be 
well on its way towards joining the prestigious club of newly 
industrialized countries in Asia by the end of the six-year 
programme. The Lao government and donors will meet again in two 
years to evaluate the trajectory of the reforms. 
  Tuesday's round-table conference was co-chaired by the 
deputy 
prime minister and by UNDP's acting director for Asia and the 
Pacific, Ms. Elena Martinez. Participants included Australia, 
Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Norway, Sweden, 
Switzerland, Thailand, the UK, the U.S.A., the Asian Development 
Bank, the European Commission, the International Fund for 
Agricultural Development, the OECD, the IMF, World Bank, FAO [UN 
Food and Agriculture Organization], UNCTAD [United Nations 
Conference on Trade and Development], UNDCP [expansion unknown], 
UNFPA [United Nations Fund for Population Activities], UNHCR, 
UNICEF, WFP [World Food Program], WHO, and the Swiss Red Cross.

  [Text] Having been concerned about the well-being of 
multiethnic people, from 21 to 25 June Nouhak Phoumsavan, 
president of the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR], paid a 
visit to Bokeo Province. 
  During his stay in the province, the LPDR president was 
warmly welcomed by Soukan Mahalat, governor of the province, 
together with cadres, soldiers, policemen, intellectuals, 
retired cadres, and a large number of local residents. He also 
heard a report from the provincial leadership on certain special 
characteristics of the province in the past as well as in the 
present. The report noted that Bokeo is located in northern 
Laos and is composed of five districts comprising 36 cantons, 
425 villages, 17,214 families, and a population of 101,132. It 
possesses 6,018 hectares of plain ricefields and 8,854 hectares 
of upland. The average annual paddy production is 340 kilo per 
person. In the 1993-94 fiscal year, the province has earned 
1.03 billion kips for the national budget. 
  At the same time, President Nouhak Phoumsavan also met with 
and talked to cadres, soldiers, policemen, intellectuals, 
retired cadres, and village-level administrative authorities in 
the provincial municipality. He told them that the party and 
state have always paid close attention to improving the living 
conditions of the multiethnic Lao people, especially those in 
remote areas. He urged and gave them much advice on how to earn 
their livelihood and develop and build their respective 
localities. He called on the local administrations and 
multiethnic people throughout the province to further enhance 
the tradition of perseverence, closely uniting around the party, 
and acting as a strong force contributing to executing the tasks 
of defending, building, and developing their own native land and 
vigorously defending and building the country along the party's 
comprehensive restructuring policy.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- The Group of Seven (G-7) 
industrialized nations are considering proposing more than 1.5 
billion dollars in aid for Ukraine as a way to ensure the safety 
of its outmoded nuclear power plants, a Japanese Government 
official said Friday [24 June]. 
  The sum, which would be proposed during the coming annual 
summit, would partly finance a plan to solidify safety shields 
of the exploded reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, 
the official said. 
  The remainder would be used to remodel several other 
reactors 
currently under construction in the former Soviet republic, the 
official said, noting that these reactors, basically identical 
in design to the exploded reactor, must be reconstructed with 
Western technology. 
  France and Germany recently proposed the aid program. 
  In April 1986, one of four reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear 
power plant exploded, resulting in the worst nuclear accident in 
history. 
  Of the three reactors left, two are still in operation, 
causing global concern over a possible repeat of the Chernobyl 
disaster. 
  During the Naples summit in July, the G-7 nations are 
expected to press for closure of the two reactors, which Ukraine 
claims are necessary as major power sources for the economically 
ailing country, the government official said.

<F P=106> [Sylvie Lepage report: "The South Pacific and French </F>
Nuclear Testing"] 
  [Text] Suva -- Although the relations between France and 
the countries of the South Pacific have improved thanks to the 
moratorium on nuclear testing declared by the president of the 
Republic, the recurring debate on whether or not it is necessary 
to restart explosions and the possibility of a decision running 
counter to that made by Francois Mitterrand after the next 
presidential election still give the countries of Oceania some 
cause for concern. However, it is uncertain whether all the 
governments of this zone will react with the same virulence. 
  Ieremia Tabai, general secretary of the South Pacific Forum 
[SPF] based in Suva said: "Relations between France and the 
countries of the SPF have taken a turn for the better. However, 
any restarting of testing at Mururoa [a French-owned South 
Pacific atoll and nuclear test site] would be a considerable 
step backward. France has always maintained that the tests do 
not endanger anyone, but we doubt this. The long-term 
consequences are still not known and people fear them." 
  For many Polynesians and Melanesians who catch their food in 
the sea, it is unbearable to think that fish could be poisoned 
and reefs destroyed. There is little point in publishing report 
after report proving that there are no leaks or pollution. They 
will not change convictions that are widely held among the 
peoples of the South Pacific. Cold reasoning and Cartesian 
logic do not work against an emotional discourse. A French 
diplomat pointed out to us that the people of Oceania consider 
nuclear testing to be "rape and sacrilege." 
  When the United States transferred their nuclear tests from 
the Pacific to Nevada, France was perceived as being the only 
country that was active outside its own region, even though the 
tests were being carried out on French soil. Don McKinnon, New 
Zealand's conservative foreign minister, asked us: "If these 
tests are really not at all dangerous, why are they not 
performed closer to mainland France?" 
<H5>  New Zealand Activism </H5>
  New Zealand is one of the few countries to have a minister 
for disarmament, "a strange creature, no doubt," Doug Graham 
says of himself. He explained: "As a small country, we have 
never gone along with the idea that a few nuclear powers -- 
previously five -- could threaten the whole world and could have 
the power, if things went wrong, to bring about the apocalypse." 
  Mr. Graham recommends that sanctions be brought against 
countries which, like North Korea, refuse a complete inspection 
of their nuclear installations by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA]. Everyone we spoke to agreed that the fact 
that new countries are looking to obtain the atom bomb in no way 
justifies the nuclear powers launching an arms-perfecting 
program implying a restart to testing. 
  This aversion is deeply-rooted in New Zealand. Former Labor 
Prime Minister David Lange (1984-1989) told us: "At a time when 
antinuclear demonstrations in Europe were confined just to 
left-wing movements, this tendency in New Zealand was much more 
widespread, to the extent that the government itself led the 
demonstrations. The fact that it sent one of its ministers, 
Paul Fraser, and two frigates to Mururoa to protest against 
atmospheric tests merely strengthened New Zealanders in their 
conviction." 
  This indignation is now shared by most neighboring 
countries. 
It is above all the opposition to nuclear testing that led to 
the creation of the Forum in 1971, an organization that aims to 
be essentially political, unlike the South Pacific Commission 
which was then still under the aegis of the colonial powers. 
  Four years later, New Zealand, Fiji, and Papua New Guinea 
managed to convince the United Nations to agree by a unanimous 
vote to pass a motion in favor of a denuclearized zone in the 
South Pacific. France and the United States abstained. In 1985, 
Wellington's efforts resulted in the denuclearization treaty 
being signed at Rarotonga, in the Cook Islands, by the 13 
countries of the Forum, with the exception of Vanuatu which 
considered that the text of the treaty did not go far enough. 
The treaty specifically bans tests and the dumping of nuclear 
waste in the waters of the zone. 
  Three protocols invited the nuclear powers to apply the 
provisions of the treaty in their territories situated in this 
region. These were rejected by France, which had just sunk the 
[Greenpeace protest ship] Rainbow Warrior in Auckland harbor, 
and by the United States, whose relations with New Zealand had 
been frosty since Wellington had banned nuclear weapon-carrying 
or nuclear-propelled vessels from entering its ports. 
  Despite the election of a new Conservative government in 
1990, Wellington did not revoke the law of 1987 which enforced 
this ban. Jim Anderton, head of the opposition Alliance party, 
stated: "Their deputies would not allow it. It would be an 
unacceptable about-turn for the people. We are proud of the 
fact that our tiny country has been able to say no to the United 
States, even though our decision means that we are still 
excluded from ANZUS (the military pact between Australia, New 
Zealand, and the United States]." 
<H5>  Danger to the Environment </H5>
  While there is no question of New Zealand going back on its 
antinuclear policy, France has nonetheless found greater 
flexibility in Fiji and Vanuatu since they changed governments. 
When Colonel Rabuka overthrew the predominantly Indian 
coalition government in 1987, Fiji lost the support of its main 
donators of aid -- a gap that France rushed to fill. In 1989, 
Mr. Rabuka was awarded the Legion d'Honneur for services to 
Lebanon...nine years after the event. Now the head of an 
elected government, Sitiveni Rabuka is calling on France, "in 
accordance with the wishes of the people of the Pacific, not to 
restart testing." 
  However, as Steven Ratuva, director of the Fijian 
antinuclear 
group, points out: "Rabuka is a soldier by training and, given 
his links with France, it is highly unlikely that the Fijian 
Government would overly pressurize Paris were testing to 
restart." Perhaps that explains why Sir Ratu Kamisese Mara, 
who, in 1985, gave a speech at the UN General Assembly 
condemning French nuclear tests on Mururoa, as Fijian president 
today refuses to grant us an interview on this specific subject. 
This is the same man who, on a visit to Paris in 1988, received 
an aid package five times greater than the one awarded in 1987. 
Issue 17 of the JOURNAL OF PACIFIC STUDIES published by the 
South Pacific University (SPU) in Suva wonders whether it is any 
coincidence that, for the following two years, the Forum toned 
down its criticisms of France. 
  In Vanuatu, the position of Maxime Carlot, elected in 1991, 
differs considerably from that taken by former Prime Minister 
Walter Lini who, since 1980 (when the French-British condominium 
of the New Hebrides gained its independence), had taken every 
opportunity to condemn Paris, especially on the subject of 
nuclear testing. Since the French-speaking group came to power, 
Vanuatu has been something of a bridgehead between mainland 
France and the countries of the South Pacific, and Mr. Carlot 
has taken care not to cause offense to any of the parties. 
  He told us: "France must take into account the wishes of the 
independent countries of the South Pacific. We, like them, 
believe that nuclear testing represents a danger for the 
environment. If France can find other solutions to perfect [its 
weapon design], then all the better." "However, those who are 
interested in Mururoa must also take an interest in the world 
balance, and my government will always be on the side of the 
free world." 
  However, here as elsewhere, everyone would be greatly 
relieved if France could banish the doubts hanging over the 
South Pacific once and for all. The credit it has gained since 
the then-Prime Minister Michel Rocard negotiated the Matignon 
Agreements on New Caledonia in 1988 by the implementation of a 
cooperation policy with these territories and the moratorium, 
will then be unlimited.

  [Text] Nusa Dua, Bali, REPUBLIKA -- ASEAN members 
undeniably need foreign funds, but they are by no means 
competing neck-to-neck to attract foreign investors. 
  "ASEAN members will not compete with one another to attract 
foreign investors, but will instead cooperate in attracting 
foreign investors as well as investors from fellow ASEAN 
members," Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo, minister of state for 
investment affairs and chairman of the Investment Coordinating 
Board, said to reporters after opening a meeting of the ASEAN 
/working group on the promotion of direct foreign investment/ in 
Nusa Dua, Bali on Monday. 
  He said ASEAN members should seek a promotional means to 
attract foreign investors now that the competition has become 
stronger. Accordingly, Sanyoto stressed the need for ASEAN 
members to anticipate global economic developments that have led 
to the formation of regional groups such as NAFTA and the 
European Union in addition to APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation] and AFTA [ASEAN Free Trade Area]. "They also have 
to anticipate the implementation of the GATT accord endorsed 
last April," said the minister of state for investment affairs 
and chairman of the Investment Coordinating Board. 
  The working group is expected to create an intra-ASEAN 
investment mechanism as well as a mechanism to attract foreign 
investors during the meeting. 
  Sanyoto said fellow ASEAN members welcomed Government 
Regulation No. 20 on Foreign Investment. "They welcome 
Government Regulation No. 20 on Foreign Investment. I got this 
impression during an /informal dinner/ in Jakarta on Sunday 
evening," he said. 
  According to Sanyoto, the government regulation was in fact 
inevitable. This means that Indonesia must take this step or 
else it will be left behind. Indonesia must enhance 
competitiveness in all fields if it wants to /survive/ in an era 
of globalization. 
  The government regulation is a means to consolidate 
ourselves 
to enhance its competitiveness to attract foreign investors. 
  Meanwhile, Sugihono Kadarisman, deputy chairman for 
promotion 
of the Investment Coordinating Board, said the working group 
will discuss the so-called noneconomic pressure in addition to 
jointly attracting foreign investors during the meeting. 
  Western nations have often exerted noneconomic pressure such 
as human rights and the MFN [most favored nation] status on the 
developing nations. 
  "We will discuss a strategy to counter the noneconomic 
pressure." 
  Sanyoto said Japan remains the largest foreign investor in 
Indonesia. "Japan may not be the number one foreign investor 
this year due to a recession, but this country cumulatively 
remains in the top slot of the list of foreign investors here," 
he said. 
  The second slot, which was held by Hong Kong from 1967 to 
May 
1994, has been taken over by Taiwan. This is understandable 
because Taiwan has been aggressive since the president and a 
number of Taiwan ministers paid unofficial visits to Indonesia. 
  Moreover, the Taiwan Government adopts the so-called /Go 
South Action Program/ that encourages Taiwan businessmen to 
invest not only in China but also countries to the south of 
Taiwan. 
  "For example, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and 
Thailand," Sanyoto said.

  [Text] China wants to reach a final settlement with the 
Philippines and other claimants to the Spratly Islands, but only 
through bilateral discussions and not through the international 
group like the United Nations or ASEAN. This was the stand 
conveyed by Premier Li Peng of China to a Philippine Government 
and business delegation led by Philippine Vice President Joseph 
Estrada in a meeting held in Beijing. 
  Li told Estrada that the discussions must be held with one 
country at a time, and not in a conference hosted by any 
international group. 
  Estrada noted, however, that the Philippines will stick to 
the position taken by ASEAN in 1992 -- that its members with 
claims over the Spratlys must negotiate with China and claimant 
Vietnam as a group. But Estrada showed his strong (?compose) 
that the Philippines would seek all peaceful means to resolve 
the problem. 
  Apart from the Philippines, China, and Vietnam, other 
claimants to the Spratlys are Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia.

  [Text] Intense battles have taken place between Loimaw 
opium smugglers led by drug kingpin Khun Sa and our military 
columns in the Mongchut area in Mong Ton Township, Mong Hsat 
District, Eastern Shan State since 11 May. 
  On 24 April, 2000 members of the Loimaw opium smuggling 
group 
led by Khun Sa left (Homay) Camp on the Thai border and entered 
the Mongchut area in Mong Ton Township on 11 May and attacked 
our military bases at Points 3686 and 4436 in full force. The 
Loimaw group attacked and captured these camps. Intense battles 
took place in the north, northeast, and south of Mongchut Camp 
from 11 to 15 May between our military columns and the smugglers 
when they infiltrated near the Mongchut Camp. 
  On 16 May, the Loimaw group retreated with heavy casualties 
and later formed strongholds on Points 3686, 4436, and 4527 
which are situated about seven miles southwest of Mongchut Camp, 
and in the hills and mountain ranges in the vicinity of these 
points. 
  Major General Saw Tun, commander of the Eastern Military 
Command, and Brigadier General Kyaw Win, commander of the Keng 
Tung Regional Command, reorganized and enforced our troops and 
pursued and attacked the retreating Loimaw group and recaptured 
Points 4436 and 3686, and Kyauktaung Camp on 21 May and 11 June 
respectively. Our troops confined the Loimaw smugglers who were 
strongly entrenched in the remaining hills and attacked them at 
close range. 
  On 13 June, about 100 members of the Loimaw opium smuggling 
group, who were strongly entrenched at Point 4410, penetrated 
and attacked our troops who were controlling the area. Due to 
our military assault, they suffered heavy causalities and only a 
few escaped. 
  On 23 June, a combined force of military columns from the 
regiment and the Air Force staged a brave and simultaneous 
attack on the Loimaw group which was strongly entrenched at 
Kagyigon, Khagwegon, and Gangwegon on Kyaukchuntaung, or Point 
4410; and Point 4527 which is situated behind these areas. Our 
military columns captured all enemy camps by 1730. The Khun 
Sa-led group sustained heavy casualties and retreated in 
disarray. 
  A total of 111 major battles and skirmishes took place 
between the Loimaw opium smuggling groups and our military 
columns from the regiment in the Mongchut area in Mong Ton 
Township from 11 May to 24 June. During those encounters, 250 
corpses from the Loimaw group were collected and 163 assorted 
weapons, 21,350 assorted ammunition rounds, 560 assorted mines, 
340 assorted rockets, two viss [3.26 kg] of marijuana, and 3 kg 
of heroin were confiscated by our military columns. 
  Some enemy corpses were handcuffed to poles in the trenches, 
while some were tied up with rope. There is evidence that the 
Loimaw smugglers used force to either handcuff or tie their 
troops in the trenches to prevent them from running away. 
Similarly, it has been learned from prisoners that their troops 
were given stimulants to fight. 
  During these encounters, 196 member of the Defense Services, 
including seven officers, gave their lives for the country, 
while 357 were wounded. 
  The Defense Services' attacks against the Loimaw opium 
smuggling group led by Khun Sa is part of Myanmar's [Burma] 
suppression drive against the danger of narcotic drugs. The 
Defense Services has sacrificed its sweat and blood to suppress 
the danger of narcotic drugs.

<F P=106> [By Lichong Akui and M. Thillinandan] </F>
  [Excerpt] Kuala Lumpur, Monday [20 June] -- It is believed 
that Melewar Corporation Chairman Tunku Abdullah Tuanku Abdul 
Rahman used his diplomatic passport to enter Israel. According 
to sources, Tunku Abdullah could only have entered Israel by 
using a diplomatic passport because Malaysia has no diplomatic 
relations with that country. A Malaysian international passport 
cannot be used to enter that country because it is stated on the 
passport that Israel is the only country that cannot be visited. 
  The sources say the Immigration Department is authorized to 
issue diplomatic passports only to diplomats, ministers, and 
royal relatives. 
  Tunku Abdullah, the younger brother of Paramount Ruler 
Tuanku 
Jaafar, reportedly paid a visit to Israel recently during which 
he met Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon 
Peres. 
  Meanwhile, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman contacted 
today did not rule out the possibility that Tunku Abdullah used 
a diplomatic passport for the visit because it is the only way 
to enter that country. "We are not sure, however, where he 
obtained a visa to enter Israel. The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs does not know positively when he left that country," he 
said. 
  Israeli television is believed to have covered Tunku 
Abdullah's visit and his meetings with Israeli leaders on 17 
June. AFP ran a similar report. 
  Yesterday, Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed 
said 
he knew nothing about Tunku Abdullah's visit and that it was 
made without the government's knowledge. 
  The spokesman said Tunku Abdullah made the visit without the 
knowledge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. An early 
investigation showed that the visit was personal; he did not 
represent any party. "We do not know the purpose of his visit," 
he said. 
  According to the spokesman, a report obtained by the 
Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs showed that Tunku Abdullah entered that 
country on 16 June but was not positive whether or not he had 
returned home. He said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not 
have the authority to question Tunku Abdullah because the matter 
falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Home Affairs and 
the Immigration Department. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kepala Batas, Sunday [26 June] -- The Government is 
unaware of a plan by a local non-governmental organisation to 
hold a forum on East Timor in Kuala Lumpur, Foreign Minister 
Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today. 
  He emphasised that the Government was not involved and would 
not give its blessings to the organisers. 
  "Our stand on the East Timor issue is clear. It is an 
Indonesian problem and it is up to the Indonesian authorities to 
resolve it," he said. 
  Abdullah was talking to reporters after attending the Bertam 
UMNO [United Malays National Organization] branch meeting which 
he heads. 
  He said the move to initiate such a forum was bound to occur 
as Malaysia practiced a democratic system that allowed freedom 
of speech. 
  "But we are hopeful it will not complicate the strong 
relationship between the two countries," he added. 
  According to the ANTARA news agency from Jakarta yesterday, 
Indonesia had expressed displeasure over the forum planned by 
the Malaysian Action Front.

Malaysian Armed Forces is expected to herald a new era as 
studies are underway to equip the army with tanks to enhance the 
country's defence in facing future challenges and threats. 
  Armoured Corps Chairman Brigadier General Mohamed Ariff Ali 
said Tuesday the study was important to gauge the effectiveness 
of deploying tanks to strengthen the country's defence as the 
armed forces did not have any at present. 
  Tanks are now necessary in modern warfare. The armoured cars 
being used do not come under the category of armoured cars, he 
told reporters in east Malaysian Sarawak state. [sentence as

  He said the study involved evaluation of modern tanks made 
in 
Eastern Bloc countries like Russia in line with Malaysia's 
recent purchase of military equipment like the MiG-29 fighter 
jets.

  [Text] KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. -- Consumer associations should 
not allow them-selves to be used by politicians and foreign 
interests which may be competing against Malaysia, Prime 
Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad said today. 
  Should this happen, the country and consumers would suffer, 
he said at the launching of World Consumers day and an 
anti-inflation campaign at Pusat Islam. 
  Dr Mahathir said knowledgeable consumers could become a 
force 
in influencing the market and controlling inflation, and 
collectively, they could eradicate all kinds of unhealthy trade 
practices. 
  "Together with the Government, they can act in a manner 
which 
will benefit them and save the country." 
  "The achievement of Vision 2020 (objectives) depends a lot 
on 
knowledge, responsible attitudes and the role of consumers -- 
that is all the people". 
  He said the Government would continue with its efforts to 
fight inflation so that it would not adversely affect the 
people's standard of living, especially the lower income group's. 
  He urged all parties to play their roles to control 
inflation 
and ensure the stability of the ringgit to protect the country's 
economy. He said that if the economy collapsed, then everybody 
-- the people, traders, banks, the Government as well as the 
country -- would suffer. He said the lower income group, those 
who did not have fixed income and pensioners were most 
vulnerable to inflation. 
  Dr Mahathir said the Government had taken various measures 
to 
reduce the inflation rate to ensure the prosperity of consumers. 
However, he said, the success of any Government policy would 
depend on the cooperation of all parties. 
  "Inflation and consumer problems cannot be resolved by only 
one party. It requires the involvement of all." 
  He said it was also important for them to understand the 
mechanisms and effects of inflation and consumer problems in 
order to play their role effectively. He said consumer groups 
were important, not only as activists but also to disseminate 
information on the matter. However, he said, consumer groups 
should not allow costs to increase because of vague struggles 
for consumer interest which sometimes contradicted with their 
own interest. 
  Dr Mahathir said the time had come for Malaysian consumers 
to 
fully realise their role which, if properly undertaken, would 
benefit all. He said consumers had tremendous power. Only by 
deciding to buy or not to buy, consumers could cause businesses 
to make profits or suffer losses, he added. 
  "When consumers are grouped in associations, their power 
will 
be so great that it will be beyond control, giving rise to the 
desire to use it for other purposes." 
  Dr Mahathir said consumers possessed a "sharp weapon" and 
urged them to be extremely careful with it because, if wrongly 
used, it could be harmful to them. 
  "On the other hand, if the power is wisely and carefully 
used, not only consumers will benefit but the country will also 
prosper," he said, adding that a progressive nation would double 
the benefits for its people. He said the Government had to take 
certain measures to ensure that consumers were given adequate 
protection. He said the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs 
Ministry was in the process of drafting a "Consumer Protection 
Bill" and a national consumer policy aimed at sefeguarding 
consumer interests. 
  Dr Mahathir said the Government had also taken numerous 
steps 
to ensure that the country's rapid development was undertaken in 
a situation where prices of goods and services were low and 
stable as it believed that price stability was the key factor in 
efforts towards sustainable development. 
  "A stringent financial policy has been implemented to 
prevent 
surplus reserves. This is to ensure that there would not exist 
a situation where too much money is chasing after a limited 
supply of goods." 
  Nevertheless, he said, after the economy recovered from the 
1987 slowdown, the country had undergone rapid growth for six 
consecutive years. He said the increase in money supply had 
resulted in excess demand. 
  If the Consumer Price Index is anything to go by, inflation 
has increased by 4.4 per cent in 1991 and 4.7 per cent in 1992, 
which is the highest since 1982. There was a drop last year to 
3.6 per cent but it increased in the first quarter of this year 
by 4.5 per cent. 
  Dr Mahathir said that when there was inflation and the value 
of money depreciated, the value of income would also decrease. 
He said the easy way to overcome the reduction in the value of 
income would be to increase salaries or profit margin. However, 
he said, salary increase because of inflation would worsen the 
situation and further reduce the value of the currency and 
weaken the economy. He said Europe was currently facing serious 
economic problems with unemployment rates of between 11 and 12 
per cent. 
  "Meetings after meeting of the Group of Seven countries have 
not been able to overcome the problem". 
  "Now they plan to force developing countries to impose the 
minimum wage rate so that their unemployment problem can be 
overcome". 
  He said the countries were more willing to see workers in 
developing countries suffer to protect their high standard of 
living. He said the wages of workers in this country should be 
increased, but it should be carried out carefully so that the 
nation would not lose its competitive edge and suffer from 
inflation. 
  "The employment of foreigners was not the way to overcome 
the 
problem. The more effective way would be to increase the 
productivity of local workers through education, improving 
production and management systems and the use of robots and 
automation or move to idustries which are more capital, knowlede 
and skill-intensive." 
  Also present at the function were Domestic Trade and 
Consumer 
Affairs Minister Datuk Abu Hassan Omar and his deputy, Datuk 
Abdul Kadir Sheikh Fadzir.

<F P=106> [By Paul Jacob in Jakarta] </F>
  [Text] Jakarta -- Singapore and Indonesia yesterday 
announced wide-ranging proposals to help boost the level of 
tourism in the two countries and strengthen the republic's 
involvement in developing supporting infrastructure for the 
sector here. 
  Communications and Environment Minister Mah Bow Tan said 
after calling on President Suharto that cooperation could 
involve joint identification of new tourist destinations, joint 
promotion and marketing, and development of air services. 
  The proposals also include cooperation in upgrading of 
airport facilities and the development of hotel and tourist 
resorts in Indonesia. 
  Mr. Mah was speaking at the end of a two-day visit to 
discuss 
the tourism cooperation proposals first raised in February 
during a visit by Foreign Affairs Minister S. Jayakumar. 
  His presence here as a personal envoy of Prime Minister Goh 
Chok Tong was seen as underlining the importance which Singapore 
attached to the ventures. 
  In Singapore, Mr. Goh said at a function in Bukit Panjang 
that Mr. Mah was in Indonesia to present Singapore's proposals 
for funnelling tourists from Singapore to Indonesia. 
  This would benefit both countries as they could be then be 
marketed to tourists together, he said. 
  He said that it was the first time that he was sending a 
personal envoy. Asked if more such envoys would be sent in 
future, he replied: "I think it will depend on the purpose." 
  In a signal of the seriousness with which Indonesia was 
treating the proposals, its senior economic ministers and State 
Secretary Murdiono arrived at the president's office immediately 
after Mr. Mah to meet Mr. Suharto and map out follow-up action. 
  Details of the proposals will be discussed further by 
high-level ministerial teams on both sides -- Singapore headed 
by Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Indonesia's by 
coordinating minister for trade and industry, Hartarto. 
  The Singapore team will include Mr. Mah and Trade and 
Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong, while Tourism, Post, and 
Telecommunications Minister Joop Ave and Transportation Minister 
Haryanto Dhanutirto round off the Indonesian side. 
  Mr. Ave told THE SUNDAY TIMES that a memorandum of 
understanding to serve as an umbrella agreement for cooperation 
would also be drawn up within the next two to three months. 
  Both he and Mr. Hartarto also said in separate comments that 
Singapore's proposals on tourism cooperation were welcomed by 
Mr. Suharto and had the full support of cabinet colleagues. 
  In his earlier remarks to the press, Mr. Mah said Singapore 
believed that as close neighbours, there was "great scope for 
both countries to cooperate in tourism development for mutual 
benefit". 
  He noted that cooperation in the development and promotion 
of 
tourism was, in fact, already under way in the Riau islands, 
principally Batam and Bintan. 
  "Good progress is being made there. We believe that we can 
expand the scope of Indonesia-Singapore tourism cooperation to 
the rest of Indonesia," he said. 
  "The aim is to get more visitors to Singapore to include 
Indonesia in the package visits." 
  Singapore attracted more than six million tourists last year 
of which 70 percent also visited other countries. Of that 
percentage, 20 percent went to Indonesia. Mr Mah's hope, shared 
by Mr. Ave, was to see an increase in the 20 percent figure. 
  Singapore also aimed to increase the number of tourists 
visiting the republic so that tourist arrivals in both countries 
would then also register increases, he said. 
  Both Mr. Hartarto and Mr. Ave said Indonesia aimed to see 
aspects of the proposed cooperation get off the ground by 
September this year and pledged to provide significant 
opportunities for private sector involvement. 
  Mr. Ave said that Singapore was keen on infrastructure 
development to support the tourism sector and said the areas 
included link roads and airports as well as hotels and tourist 
resorts in Indonesia. He said Mr. Suharto saw Singapore being 
able to play a role "as a provider of financial resources or as 
an investor in a variety of ways such as through joint ventures 
and joint operations." 
  Both he and Mr. Hartarto also said in separate comments that 
Singapore's proposals on tourism cooperation were welcomed by 
Mr. Suharto and had the full support of cabinet colleagues. 
  Indonesia had singled out existing tourist destinations and 
those with potential which could benefit from the co-operation. 
These were in West Sumatra Province, Yogyakarta, and Solo in 
Central Java, Lombok island off Bali, and Ujungpandang in South 
Sulawesi Province.

  [Summary] "A reliable source in the Ministry of Public 
Works and Transport cites the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia as 
saying that the Chinese Government has decided to withdraw part 
of its $8.6 million loan and use it to repair the Mao Zedong 
road in Cambodia. The rest will be used to buy vehicles. 
  "Ms. (Xi Yuyi), PRC ambassador to Cambodia, met and 
discussed 
this matter with Ing Kiet, state secretary of the Ministry of 
Public Works and Transport, on 21 June." 
  This decision has disappointed the ministry which has 
written 
a letter to the Royal Government requesting that the total loan 
be maintained for the ministry as mentioned in the agreement 
signed between the two countries on 17 January 1994. 
  "According to the agreement, the loan will be used for the 
four most important domains urgently needed by the ministry, 
that is, 862,200 dollars for buying two airplanes, $2.8 million 
for buying 190 large and small vehicles for transportation work, 
and $4,437,800 for repairing railroads." 
  It is unknown why the Chinese side wants to divert its loan 
of $8.6 million to the Royal Government for repairing Mao Zedong 
road which has not been mentioned in the agreement. 
  Some people have said that if China wants to repair this 
road, it should have asked for funds from the Chinese people and 
Government instead of using this loan which will only affect the 
important projects set in the agreement. 
  "The source added that the $4.4 million budget set for the 
repair of railway system is very important because Cambodia's 
railroads are now very old and damaged." According to the 
project, this budget is set to repair the Phnom 
Penh-Sihanoukville line and purchase steel and other materials 
to improve the railway system. 
  If the Chinese side withdraws part of this fund, the repair 
of railway system will be forced to depend on other loans. In 
this case, in addition to being disappointing, the agreement 
which was signed by government representatives of the two 
countries will be meaningless.

  [Text] The Embassy of the Kingdom of Cambodia in the 
Kingdom of Thailand will open for business this June. This will 
be the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two 
countries after the embassy had been closed for more than two 
decades because of endless civil war. However, sources at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the 
Kingdom of Cambodia have not specified the date the embassy will 
officially be opened. 
  Eng Roland -- an official of FUNCINPEC [National United 
Front 
for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] 
and former minister of tourism in the provisional national 
government of Cambodia, and who has been appointed ambassador 
extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the Kingdom of Thailand -- 
has expressed his determination to improve the relations between 
the two neighboring countries, and in particular to avoid mutual 
misunderstanding. Roland also optimistically hopes that 
relations between the two countries will improve once the 
Cambodian Embassy is opened. 
  This first Cambodian diplomat did not elaborate on what he 
called mutual misunderstanding. However, his statement was 
thought to have referred to the war of words between the 
Cambodian and Thai Governments at the end of April and early May 
because of the Khmer Rouge issue. 
  It may be remembered that the Khmer Rouge problem caused a 
fairly strong verbal exchange between government leaders and 
foreign ministers of Cambodia and Thailand. The Cambodian 
Government believed and had proof to show that Thailand did 
indeed support the Khmer Rouge in attacks against government 
troops in western Cambodia. As for Thailand, it affirmed that 
it had never provided assistance as accused by the Cambodian 
Government. Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister, used strong 
words, even saying that the matter will be taken up with the UN 
Security Council. Howver, the troubled atmosphere between 
Cambodia and Thailand became relaxed through a diplomatic 
settlement. 
  Eng Roland did not discuss how he will start his work with 
Thailand. However, it is understood that diplomacy with 
Thailand is very important to put pressure on the Khmer Rouge at 
a time when the government wants to have something clear from 
Thailand. 
  It is worth noting that the Cambodian Embassy in Thailand 
has 
suffered only slightly and repairs have already been made. The 
embassy is located on Ratdamri Road in Bangkok.

<F P=106> [Interview with Khieu Samphan, chairman of the Party of </F>
Democratic Kampuchea, by station correspondent on 26 June; place 
not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] My respects to His Excellency Mr. 
Chairman. Thank you for allowing me to interview you on behalf 
of the Voice of the Great National Union Front of Cambodia 
[VGNUFC] radio. Here is my first question: Recently, the masses 
throughout the country were very indignant with Hun Sen for 
insulting His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk in a message dated 
18 June 1994; what is your opinion on this matter? 
  [Khieu Samphan] Thank you, comrade representative of the 
VGNUFC radio. Our nation and people know very well that it has 
always been His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk's wish to bring 
about national reconciliation and to unite all Cambodian 
factions so that peace in the Kingdom of Cambodia can be 
restored. The king sees that the situation in our country has 
been steadily deteriorating. For a long time, he has repeatedly 
referred to this serious situation. If my memory does not fail 
me, he has talked about this situation since the end of 1992. 
Apart from his majesty, every simple Cambodian citizen has a 
duty to be concerned with and express his view on the destiny of 
his own nation. The king is even more duty bound toward and 
responsible for the destiny of the nation. The king clearly 
understands that there is only one way to get out of this 
desperately serious situation, namely, through national 
reconciliation. 
  The king, therefore, has all along expressed his opinion on 
national reconciliation. He also proposed that a roundtable be 
held between Cambodian leaders; however, he was resolutely 
opposed by Hun Sen. Afterwards, he proposed that, since a 
roundtable was not feasible, at least there should be 
discussions and consultations. He offered himself to be the 
bridge so that meetings or consultations could be held to 
produce some results -- at least 10 or 20 percent. However, Hun 
Sen was still opposed to this idea. Hun Sen opposed roundtables 
and refused to meet with the Party of Democratic Kampuchea. 
Still, his majesty the king kept trying until there was the 
roundtable in Pyongyang, where a roundtable commission was 
formed to carry on the talks. Yet, Hun Sen was still working to 
sabotage the roundtable and the meeting of the roundtable 
commission. 
  In that situation, still not satisfied with his efforts, the 
king granted a press interview in Beijing on 11 June in which he 
again mentioned the deteriorating situation of the country. He 
expressed the view that one cannot solve the problem through 
war, which can only cause death and destruction to the nation. 
He said that, in the face of such a situation, he could not 
remain indifferent and could not die with his eyes closed. Just 
because of that, Hun Sen wrote a letter dated 18 June to insult 
and disparage the king. Hun Sen said it was ridiculous of his 
majesty, out of hunger for power, to try and use the press to 
overthrow Hun Sen and call for demonstrations to topple him. 
Hun Sen then declared that he was categorically opposed to the 
formation of any national reconciliation government. Hun Sen 
reminded his majesty that the current Hun Sen was different from 
the Hun Sen he knew in the past, and he insisted that his 
majesty give him an answer, saying he was waiting for an answer 
so that he could take further action. 
  It is regrettable that Hun Sen used such filthy language 
with 
his majesty the king. The king, at his advanced age, could 
easily be Hun Sen's father. There is no reason for Hun Sen to 
insult him like that. The king is a national leader, respected 
by both our people and the rest of the world. He has great 
experience in national government. What he did was only to 
kindly remind Hun Sen to open his eyes and see how grave our 
country's situation is and how seriously it is deteriorating. 
He merely asked for national reconciliation. There is no 
reason for Hun Sen to insult and disparage him in this way. 
Does he deserve to be a son of Cambodia, a minister, or a prime 
minister? Is there any justification for him to insult the king 
like that? He did not insult just the person of the king. He 
insulted him because he had asked for the cessation of war, for 
national reconciliation in line with the desire and need of our 
nation and people. 
  Such a lese majeste, legally speaking, deserves severe 
punishment. Everybody knows how serious this offense is in the 
law of our country and the world. 
  [Correspondent] In your opinion, why then did Hun Sen do 
what 
he did? 
  [Khieu Samphan] Before answering this question, I would like 
to tell you that in my opinion our entire nation and people have 
the same view as I do. This is not just a question of Hun Sen 
insulting and disparaging his majesty. The substance of his 
majesty's statements, as I have already informed you, is that 
which is held by both his majesty and our entire nation and 
people. Therefore, this reflects the current conflict between 
two policies, two forces, in our country. On the one hand, 
there are the forces that continue to ignite the war and oppose 
national reconciliation; and on the other hand, there are the 
forces of our nation, people, and peace-and justice-loving 
countries in the world that want to see peace restored and 
national reconciliation achieved in Cambodia. 
  In writing the letter to insult and disparage his majesty, 
Hun Sen overtly represented communist Vietnam and the bad 
elements in the Western alliance in his opposition to the king, 
national reconciliation, peace, and the Cambodian nation and 
people. 
  [Correspondent] As you said previously, in the 18 June 
letter, Hun Sen wrote that the current Hun Sen was different 
from the Hun Sen of the past, for this was a Hun Sen who 
demanded that his majesty give him an answer; and Hun Sen said 
he was waiting for an answer in order to take further action. 
In your opinion, what did Hun Sen mean? 
  [Khieu Samphan] In my opinion, Hun Sen wanted to say that in 
the past Hun Sen was merely a puppet of communist Vietnam. Only 
communist Vietnam was his boss. No countries recognized the 
so-called State of Cambodia then and no countries recognized Hun 
Sen as prime minister. Now, following the signing of the Paris 
agreements, after the bad elements in the Western alliance have 
tampered with the Paris agreements, after the UNTAC [UN 
Transitional Authority in Cambodia] elections have been held, 
and after the bad elements in the Western alliance have colluded 
with communist Vietnam in conjuring up the two-headed 
government, Hun Sen has won the backing of both communist 
Vietnam and the bad elements in the Western alliance as well as 
the recognition of the United Nations. Moreover, the bad 
elements in the Western alliance are giving him arms. It was 
for these reasons that Hun Sen was flexing his muscles and 
showing them to the king and others. Hun Sen threatened that if 
he did not get the right answer from the king, he would make a 
liberal use of his military and police forces. When he wrote 
that he was waiting for an answer from his majesty in order to 
take further action, Hun Sen meant to cow his majesty into 
stopping making statements about peace, the end of war, national 
reconciliation, roundtables, and the roundtable commission's 
meetings. If his majesty continued to talk about them, Hun Sen 
would take brutal action. 
  In my opinion, this was not only a threat, an intimidation 
against his majesty. It was a threat, an intimidation, and an 
attempt to gag other parties and other personalities, including 
some ministers in the two-headed government who support his 
majesty, have the same opinion as his majesty, want to solve the 
problem peacefully, and want to end the war. In other words, 
Hun Sen wanted to intimidate and cow everybody with the use of 
brute force in the form of both the military and police forces. 
Hun Sen, Chea Sim, and Sar Kheng undermined the roundtable, 
shut off the Democratic Kampuchea office in Phnom Penh, closed 
down newspapers, ordered their fascist policemen and soldiers to 
assassinate journalists, summoned journalists for harassment, 
and arbitrarily arrested, incarcerated, and shot people in Phnom 
Penh and the provinces. All these fascist actions were made to 
oppose national reconciliation and close the mouth and plug the 
ears of the people to prevent them from talking or hearing about 
national reconciliation so that communist Vietnam and the other 
bad elements in the Western alliance could jointly send in arms 
to carry on the war and destroy the Cambodian nation and people 
and Democratic Kampuchea. 
  [Correspondent] If that is the case, what is the frame of 
mind of our Cambodian nation and people? 
  [Khieu Samphan]) Hun Sen clearly upholds the banner of 
communist Vietnam, the banner of national treason, the banner of 
those who have sold out their nation against the king, the 
country, and the people. He upholds the banner of war, the 
banner of fascism, corruption, and oppression of the people. He 
orders the fascist policemen and soldiers to persecute, arrest, 
incarcerate, and slaughter the nation and people and allows 
Vietnamese immigrants to arrogantly grab our land and orchards, 
steal the fish in our rivers and lakes, rob us of our forests, 
take all our jobs, and seize even vending stalls in our markets. 
Our nation and people will surely fight back because they can 
no longer stand it. They are rising up and fighting. Our 
people refuse to live like a snake and die like a frog without 
struggling. 
  The current situation is like a painful boil full of pus on 
the verge of eruption, with Hun Sen pricking it with a stick. 
Everybody knows that the students, teachers, civil servants, 
and even some ministers in the two-headed government want 
national reconciliation and oppose war. Our people oppose war. 
The soldiers of the two-headed government also oppose war. 
Everybody knows all about this. The foreign press in general is 
writing about it. The soldiers and even the officers of the 
two-headed government have told foreign newspapers that they no 
longer want to die in the place of Hun Sen, Chea Sim, and Sar 
Kheng. What does all of this mean? Does it not mean that the 
soldiers of the two-headed government are opposed to war and 
those who have kindled it? 
  The two-headed government can no long conscript soldiers. 
They have used fascist soldiers and policemen to surround 
villages and schools and still they cannot conscript many 
soldiers. The few who were conscripted later on deserted. 
Those who were ordered to go to the battlefields ended up 
deserting. Because it failed to conscript soldiers, the 
two-headed government issued a law mobilizing the militia. Yet, 
it could not mobilize as many of them as they wished. What can 
it mean other than that the people are opposed to war? 
  Moreover, the para troops [former non-communist resistance 
fighters] of Prince Ranariddh and Dien Del have become very 
frustrated. They were integrated into communist Vietnam's 
puppet army and placed under the command of communist Vietnam's 
puppets in the most ignominious manner. Communist Vietnam's 
puppets have only contempt for them and treat them like their 
running dogs. Communist Vietnam's puppets have ordered them to 
fight and die in their place. When they refuse to fight, 
communist Vietnam's puppet leaders shoot them dead. Their wives 
and daughters at home have been raped and their cattle stolen. 
Some soldiers of Prince Ranariddh who had no land to stay on 
and no huts to live in once occupied a piece of land at O Bek 
K'am in Stoeng Meanchey [a Phnom Penh suburb]. Prince Ranariddh 
together with Hun Sen, Sar Kheng, and Yu Hokkri dispatched 
artillery pieces, small arms, and armored cars to surround and 
kill them. 
  Now the para troops of Prince Ranariddh, like those of Dien 
Del, have been almost completely disbanded and decimated. When 
Prince Ranariddh and Dien Del tried to conscript more para 
troops in Oddar Meanchey, Thmar Puok, Preah Net Preah, and other 
places, they met with a stiff resistance from the people. No 
one wanted to join them any more. The anger of Prince 
Ranariddh's and Dien Del's para troops has seethed for months, 
and now with Hun Sen insulting and disparaging his majesty no 
one at all wants to become a para soldier of Prince Ranariddh or 
Dien Del. The former para troops are returning to their 
hometowns and an increasing number of them are joining the 
people and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea in the 
struggle to defend their villages and hometowns. 
  In conclusion, our nation and people oppose war and want 
national reconciliation. Hun Sen is upholding the banner of 
communist Vietnam and the bad elements in the Western alliance 
in igniting the war. Our nation and people vigorously oppose 
them. Their fate is sealed in the history of the ages. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Do you have 
something else to add before ending this interview? 
  [Khieu Samphan] I would like to recall and emphasize the 
position of Democratic Kampuchea as follows: Democratic 
Kampuchea is the victim and not the instigator of war. 
Communist Vietnam is the instigator of war. It sent hundreds 
of thousands of its troops to invade Cambodia at the end of 
1978. Recently, it colluded to form the two-headed government 
and it combined forces to attack Democratic Kampuchea in Stoung, 
Phnum Chhat, Anlung Veng, Pailin, and other areas while 
Democratic Kampuchea merely exercised its right to self-defense. 
Although it has a complete right to self-defense, Democratic 
Kampuchea has continued doggedly to seek meetings and talks so 
as to reach a better mutual understanding with others and 
gradually find common points in a move toward realizing national 
reconciliation and securing sufficient national forces to solve 
the nation's major and minor problems. All of this is because 
Democratic Kampuchea clearly understands, as his majesty has 
already pointed out, that war means death, the death of not just 
a few people but of the entire nation and people; it means 
racial extinction. This is because the war gives an opportunity 
for Vietnam to send massive numbers of its people into Cambodia 
to swallow this country up. Therefore, only with national 
reconciliation can the nation survive. Achieving national 
reconciliation, as an important personality in Phnom Penh said, 
is like boring a hole in a piece of wood. You cannot make the 
hole just by merely placing the drill on the wood; you must 
drill it little by little until the drill is through. This 
means that just a couple of rounds of talks or negotiations will 
not make national reconciliation. We need more meetings and 
consultations. 
  I firmly believe in the force of our nation and people. I 
believe that the force of national reconciliation will surely 
prevail. The truth about this has been proven by history. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to 
interview you today. Before taking leave of you, I would like 
to wish you the best of health and success in your lofty 
patriotic mission. Thank you.

  [Text] Mr. Sam Rangsi, vice chairman of the FUNCINPEC 
[National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, 
and Cooperative Cambodia] party and economy and finance minister 
of the two-headed government, stated that he supported Foreign 
Minister Norodom Sirivut's position that outlawing the Khmer 
Rouge is contrary to the king's idea. Mr. Sam Rangsi said that 
if the National Assembly ratifies this law next July all the 
budget will be used for military purposes and none will be left 
for national reconstruction.

  [Text] Many unofficial news reports have revealed that the 
official visit of the Royal Government's first and second prime 
ministers to Indonesia was one of the most important quests for 
political, economic, and military support. Radio Australia 
reported that Indonesia pledged to continue aid for Cambodia's 
national reconstruction. This commitment was made by President 
Suharto during an official reception hosted in honor of 
Cambodia's high-ranking delegation headed by Prince Krompreah 
Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen. 
  At 2020 on the night of 22 June when the two Cambodian prime 
ministers returned home and landed at Pochentong Airport, they 
did not answer any questions from the press. Prince Krompreah 
Norodom Ranariddh merely shouted the word "Success!" many times 
and Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister, with broad smiles 
gave KAOH SANTEPHEAP a thumbs-up in the dark of the night. 
  This word "Success!" clearly showed that Indonesia, a former 
cochair of the Paris conference seeking peace for Cambodia, 
certainly has not disavowed its pledge to meet Cambodia's needs. 
  The big boil has broken. 
  In the past, fired by its desire to bring peace to the 
motherland, the Royal Government consented to lower itself to 
the same level of the genocidal Khmer Rouge butchers by agreeing 
to sit at roundtables with them at the behest of his majesty the 
king. This already was too much of a concession by the Royal 
Government when it accepted to sit with those who had murdered 
their own people. 
  Also in the past the people had hoped that the king, the 
only 
one who could bring peace to the kingdom, would deliver. 
However, this hope just fizzled out like salt in water 
following the two failed "roundtables." On whom would the hope 
be placed now? Besides the king, no one else can get peace 
through talks. Now that the king has said he would not propose 
a third roundtable, nothing remains for us to do. 
  Political analysts stress that there is only one way: to 
outlaw the Khmer Rouge and turn them into rebels. 
  The symptom has gradually appeared, starting with the 
official expulsion of the Khmer Rouge from Phnom Penh before 19 
June. The Khmer Rouge office in the walled compound near the 
royal palace has been pulled out right on time. When they were 
leaving Phnom Penh, the Khmer Rouge declared that the only way 
left for them was to resume fighting. 
  The Khmer Rouge declaration of fighting did not take place 
only when they were sent packing from Phnom Penh. It has taken 
place since 1979. The Khmer Rouge have been fighting for 15 
years now. It is not true at all that fighting just started 
after the "roundtable" got "smashed." 
  Nevertheless, while the Royal Government was kicking the 
Khmer Rouge out of Phnom Penh and was taking a step closer to 
declaring the Khmer Rouge outlaws, two members of the Royal 
Government who had never tasted the Khmer Rouge bitter rule 
before -- namely, Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut and His 
Excellency Sam Rangsi -- threatened to resign from their posts. 
  Hey! Hey! This is the big boil that is erupting! The 
supporters of the Khmer Rouge who massacred over 3 million 
people have bared themselves as starkly as daylight. 
  This piece of news was broadcast by Radio Australia on 21 
June to be picked up by the Voice of America. Political 
analysts in Cambodia maintained that we should not allow the 
outlawing of the genocidal Khmer Rouge to become "hostage" of a 
threat. The Royal Government also should not hesitate in 
the face of resignation should there really be an offer to 
resign. This is because in an organic system, when there is 
"ingestion" there should also be "excretion" for the sake of 
good health. "Ingestion" without "excretion" can only "harm" 
your health. 
The common people do not have greencards. 
  Only Cambodians who experienced the misery of three years 
eight months and 20 days in the prison without walls know the 
Khmer Rouge better than the Khmer Rouge, the pro-Khmer Rouge, or 
certainly the Khmer Rouge partisans. 
  There was not a single family that did not suffer from the 
killings, the inhuman treatment at the hands of Pol Pot and 
Khieu Samphan. It is true that over the past 10 years most 
vestiges of the killing-fields regime have been erased by the 
common people working in coordination with the former State of 
Cambodia. Yet, no one can forget it. 
  Some people have claimed that they are clean, love the 
country, are loyal to the nation, and so on. However, their 
patriotism, their loyalty always has a price in return. 
  Nevertheless, if anyone wants to thoroughly screen them 
out, go ahead, do it! Just do not screw things up. 
  According to a KAOH SANTEPHEAP poll, the common people are 
happy to see the Khmer Rouge declared outlaw rebels because the 
Khmer Rouge have been rebels since 1979. There should not be 
any difficulty declaring them as such one more time. 
  It would be better for those who are not happy with the move 
to outlaw the Khmer Rouge and go live with them in the jungle. 
But if they love Cambodians, they should have pity for 
Cambodians by not trying to resurrect the defunct genocidal 
rule, because the common people are not greencard holders.

  [Summary] "In a joint project of the National Bank of 
Cambodia [NBC], the private banks are required to distribute 10 
to 20 percent of their capital to the agricultural development 
in Cambodia. 
  "Mr. Nuon Sam-an, deputy director of the NBC's Private Bank 
Inspection Department, has said that the private banks have all 
agreed to set aside a part of their banking capital as loans to 
the farmers." 
  All 30 private commercial banks in Cambodia know that 
Cambodia's national economy relies mainly on the agriculture. 
They are waiting for the NBC to issue a law as a guarantee for 
their loans. 
  Asked when the farmers will get the loans from private 
banks, 
the deputy director said that the NBC is arranging this law. 
"He added, however, that the fund to be set aside will not 
exceed 20 percent of each commercial bank's capital." 
  A term will be stated in this law that any private bank not 
willing to deal directly with the farmers may give the loan to 
the NBC by charging interest at the international rate. 
Discussion is being carried out on whether 10 or 20 prcent of 
the capital should be set aside. The NBC will be responsible 
for the repayment if the loan is given through it. 
  Nuon Sam-an also said that the discussion on this law was 
stalled when it came to the question on who should be 
responsible for the repayment if the farmers fail to keep their 
pledge. It is still not known when this law will be finalized.

  [Text] This morning, His Excellency [H.E.] Saman 
Vi-gnaket, chairman of the National Assembly of the Lao People's 
Democratic Republic [LPDR], held talks at the National Assembly 
Hall in Vientiane with H.E. Jose de Venecia, speaker of the 
House of Representatives of the Republic of Philippines, who, 
together with his wife and delegation, are currently on a 
five-day official friendship visit to the LPDR. Attending the 
talks on the Lao side were H.E. Chaleun Yiapaoheu, chief of the 
Secretariat Commission of the National Assembly, and H.E. Viset 
Savengseuksa, deputy chief of the Foreign Affairs Commission of 
the National Assembly, along with a number of members of the 
National Assembly. Attending on the Philippine side were H.E. 
Victor F. Ortega, H.E. Roque Ablan, and H.E. (?David A. Prace de 
Lean), members of the House of Representatives; Ms. Rosalinda 
Tirona, ambassador of the Republic of Philippines to the LPDR; 
H.E. (Burirat Namwat), secretary general of the AIPO [ASEAN 
Interparliamentary Organization]; Ms. Ma Thea Raza, director of 
the Southeast Asia Department of the Philippine Foreign Affairs 
Ministry; and delegation comprising nine members. 
  After the talks, H.E. Chaleun Yiapaoheu, chief of the 
Secretariat Commission of the National Assembly, granted an 
interview to a national radio correspondent on the atmosphere 
and outcome of the talks between the delegation of the LPDR 
National Assembly and the delegation of the House of 
Representatives of the Republic of Philippines. He said: [Begin 
Chaleun Yiapaoheu recording] 
  Beloved listeners, at 0855 today, high-level assembly 
delegations of Laos and Philippines held official talks at the 
National Assembly Hall in Vientiane. The talks proceeded in an 
atmosphere of close friendship and mutual understanding. In the 
talks, first and foremost, H.E. Saman Vi-gnaket, chairman of the 
LPDR National Assembly, on behalf of the National Assembly and 
the multiethnic Lao people, gave his wholehearted greetings to 
the high-level delegation of the Philippine House of 
Representatives on its official visit led by H.E. Jose de 
Venecia, speaker of the House and concurrently chairman of the 
ASEAN Parliamentary Federation, which has brought to the Lao 
people the affection and friendship of the Philippine people. 
He highly valued this visit and noted that it as a new 
milestone in the friendly relations and cooperation between Laos 
and the Philippines. He also highly assessed the success 
achieved by the Philippine people in developing the country, and 
hailed the significant contribution made by the Philippines to 
the Lao people as well as to this region and the world. 
  On this occasion, Saman Vi-gnaket briefed the Philippine 
delegation on our initial achievements in implementing the 
state's restructuring policy. He particularly pointed out to 
the Philippine delegation that, following the implementation of 
the political and economic restructuring plans, tranquillity has 
been maintained, the economy and society have been developed, 
the people's living conditions have been improved with each 
passing day, the multiethnic people have enjoyed solidarity and 
harmony, and the country has maintained peace and stability in 
all respects. Saman Vi-gnaket also informed the guests of the 
National Assembly's domestic and foreign activities. He 
recalled the significant roles and responsibilities of the first 
and the second Supreme People's assemblies and then noted the 
roles and responsibilities of the third National Assembly. 
Regarding this, he informed the Philippine delegation of the 
organizational activities of the third National Assembly, in 
particular its contribution to establishing laws and the 
constitution and its activities in following up and controlling 
the implementation of the constitution and the laws. 
  For the Philippine side, H.E. Jose de Venecia expressed his 
profound thanks to H.E. Saman Vi-gnaket and the Lao delegation 
for inviting him to pay the official visit to the LPDR and for 
the warm, friendly welcome accorded him and his delegation. He 
informed our Lao side that this visit to Laos was taking place 
following his visits to the PRC and Thailand. He said: This 
visit is outstanding and very significant not only for the 
assemblies of the two countries, but also for ASEAN as a whole. 
This is because Laos, in the eyes of ASEAN and the Philippines, 
has maintained a significant role in this region. He further 
noted that democracy is now being practiced in the LPDR, and 
that in this regard, the National Assembly has played a 
significant role in promoting and encouraging the practice of 
the democratic system. Understanding this fact, H.E. Jose de 
Venecia has agreed to encourage the Philippine side to set up an 
embassy in Vientiane at an early date. He said he will present 
a report to the Philippine House of Representatives and urge the 
House to endorse funds for the building of the Philippine 
Embassy in Vientiane. 
  H.E. Jose de Venecia has also invited a delegation of the 
LPDR National Assembly to attend the ASEAN parliamentary 
meeting, which is scheduled to be held in Manila, capital of the 
Philippines, from 16 to 24 September of this year. In addition 
to the members of the ASEAN group, representatives from the 
United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and India will also 
attend the meeting. In addition, H.E. Jose de Venecia hailed 
the Lao leaders for effectively promoting and expanding their 
roles and responsibilities. As a result, the political status 
of Laos has been raised to an ever higher level both at home and 
abroad. Laos' economic foundation has been also increasingly 
developed to the extent that it can enter the international 
arena. He hailed the courage, talents, and quickness of the Lao 
leaders in striving to improve the economy. As a result of the 
effort, inflation has dropped from 60 percent in previous years 
to 8 percent this year. This is considered as a success in the 
economic field. It can be also considered as a significant 
success for the political agenda, which has brought about the 
maintenance of the roles and influences of the Lao leaders and 
the implementation of the popular democratic system in Laos. He 
also appraised Laos' success in enforcing the constitution and a 
number of laws which have created the conditions for foreign 
countries to invest in the LPDR. 
  H.E. Jose de Venecia also gave his views on increasing the 
relations and cooperation between the LPDR and the Philippines 
following this visit. On this, he believed particularly that 
trade exchanges between the two countries should be promoted and 
that investment should be made directly in the LPDR by the 
private sector in the form of private businesses or 
partnerships. In addition, he noted the promotion and expansion 
of the bilateral trade relations, saying this work is seen as a 
significant issue for Laos and the Philippines. He recalled 
that in the history of Laos and the Philippines, the peoples of 
the two countries have maintained good relations with each 
other. The Philippines has in the past set up 12 hospitals in 
Laos. It brought more than 1,000 (?technicians, nurses), and 
physicians to work in aid projects in Laos. Now, the aid can be 
increased. In addition, he promised to encourage the Philippine 
Government, through the House, to grant technical assistance to 
Laos. [words indistinct] He also pointed out that in the 
Philippines, there is a project to build some three million 
living quarters, and said timber is needed for use in building 
the houses. For this reason, it is likely that Laos and the 
Philippines will engage in trading timber to serve the said 
construction work. In addition, he noted that, regarding the 
promotion and expansion of the relations between the assemblies 
of the two countries, an association of friendship between the 
assemblies of Laos and the Philippines may be established, or 
cooperation and exchange of experiences in the legislative and 
legal affairs may be carried out. 
  In conclusion, H.E. Jose de Venecia has invited H.E. Saman 
Vi- gnaket, chairman of the National Assembly of the LPDR, to 
pay a visit to the Republic of Philippines at an appropriate 
time. H.E. Saman Vi-gnaket highly apprised and expressed 
satisfaction with the views of H.E. the speaker of the 
Philippine House of Representatives, and was pleased to accept 
the invitation for a visit. The Philippine side would later be 
informed of appropriate time and dates of the visit through 
diplomatic channels. H.E. Saman Vi-gnaket welcomed the creative 
views of H.E. Jose de Venecia on issues concerning the promotion 
and expansion of the Laos- Philippines relations and cooperation 
in the next stage. 
  This is the successful outcome of the talks held between the 
two sides in Vientiane this morning. Thank you. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 28 Jun Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] On 27 June, Prime Minister Hata called senior 
Foreign and Finance Ministry officials to the prime minister's 
official residence to hold a summit study meeting, on the eve of 
summit talks of the industrialized nations (the Naples Summit) 
scheduled to open on 8 July. 
  The Hata cabinet is no longer in a position to make any 
major 
policy decisions since Prime Minister Hata announced his cabinet 
would resign en masse. Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Ishihara 
told a news conference, however, that "the Hata cabinet is 
responsible for making preparations for the Naples Summit and it 
is a matter of course for the cabinet to make those 
preparations." Aides to the prime minister have stressed: 
"Prime Minister Hata is not making preparations for the Naples 
Summit on the premise of his attendance at it." But speculation 
is spreading in Nagata-cho that "the prime minister is showing 
extraordinary eagerness for reelection and attendance at the 
Naples Summit" as he is working hard on the preparations for the 
summit. 
  At the end of the study meeting which lasted about one hour, 
the prime minister told a group of reporters: "If Japan skips 
the Naples Summit, it will be left behind by the international 
community and give the impression that its politics is in a 
shambles. Japan should attend the summit no matter what 
position it is in." In this way, the prime minister's statement 
can be interpreted as his eagerness to attend the Naples Summit 
or as his lingering attachment to it. 
  The prime minister is taking a wait-and see position on his 
reelection. During a meeting with a group of reporters, one 
reporter told the prime minister: "Many people appear to be 
hoping for your reelection as prime minister." In response, the 
prime minister said: "I have left the question of my reelection 
as prime minister to the Diet." On the evening of 27 June, the 
prime minister returned in a happy mood to the prime minister's 
official residence after attending a meeting at a Tokyo 
restaurant. A reporter told the prime minister: "The political 
situation appears to be in turmoil." In response, the prime 
minister said: "I do not know; I know nothing. I think that I 
had better fall from power once. Many are moving to become 
prime minister out of conscious for their reputation."

  [Text] The MAINICHI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide 
telephone poll on 25 June, when Prime Minister Hata announced 
that his cabinet would resign en masse, to ask 100 voters about 
their choice for the next prime minister. The poll found that 
60 percent of the voters said, "Hata should become prime 
minister again," or "other politicians would be the same as 
Hata." In the poll, the voters nominated 13 specific 
candidates, with the exception of Hata, to be the next prime 
minister, but the 13 candidates altogether were supported by 
less than 10 percent of the voters. The poll revealed the fact 
that the people were disenchanted with politics amid the 
political turmoil. When asked in the poll about the next prime 
minister, 44 voters, or nearly one-half of those polled, chose 
Mr. Hata, while seven voters chose Masayoshi Takemura and seven 
chose [Ichiro] Ozawa; 18 percent of the voters said, "I have no 
position," or "I have no politician to nominate"; and former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa was nominated by two voters to 
be the next prime minister, while Yoshiro Mori of the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP], former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, 
Hajime Funada of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], and Hokkaido 
Governor Takahiro Yokomichi were each nominated by one voter to 
be the next prime minister. [figures as published] 
  Among the voters who chose Hata to be the next prime 
minister, a company employee, age 27, from Aomori city, said: 
"Hata was too short-lived. If no other politicians can do 
better than Hata, then Hata should become prime minister again." 
A housewife, age 37, from Fukui city, said, "Hata gives the 
image of being an ordinary citizen." The seven voters who chose 
Ozawa to be the next prime minister said, "Ozawa is now actually 
managing politics, and we want him to carry out his activities 
openly in the political arena." 
  An overwhelming number of the voters favored an alliance 
between the LDP and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] 
for the next coalition government, while 41 voters expressed 
hope for the SDPJ's return to the government. Forty-five voters 
expressed hope for the LDP's return to the government, saying, 
"The LDP should participate in the coalition government, or the 
LDP should forge an alliance with Shinseito." Meanwhile, some 
voters stressed "the need to realign the established political 
parties" and asserted that "the LDP and the SDPJ should both be 
split up," or "what matters is not the alliance but the 
substance of policies." 
  Asked in the poll what they expect of the next government, 
46 
voters cited economic stimulus measures, while 21 voters cited a 
reform of the tax system, with 18 voters citing an improvement 
in the social welfare system. 
  All the voters polled reacted coolly to the prime minister's 
abrupt announcement that his cabinet will resign en masse. A 
female voter who works for an organization in Fukushima 
Prefecture said: "Japan is saddled with a host of domestic and 
external issues, such as the yen's appreciation, deregulation, 
and the [Naples G-7] summit. This is not the time for 
politicians to engage in political strife." 
  Yachio Okura, a company employee from Mekuro ward in Tokyo, 
demanded a dissolution of the House of Representatives, saying: 
"The replacement of the prime minister alone is meaningless. 
Even if the SDPJ returns to the coalition government, it would 
not set out clear-cut policies. I am disgusted with the 
political strife and the attempts to secure the required number 
of parliamentary seats."

  [Text] There is a growing concern within the government 
over the impact of the en masse resignation of the Hata cabinet 
on Japanese diplomacy. A Foreign Ministry source said: "The 
act indicates that the cabinet has given no importance to 
diplomacy. This will impair Japan's reputation." The anxiety 
has arisen because Japan has to deal with many 
diplomatically-important international meetings next month. 
These include the Japan-U.S. summit, the Naples summit (G-7 
summit talks), and the "ASEAN regional forum," where the first 
Asia-Pacific region security talks will be held. 
  At a 25 June news conference, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa 
said: "It is very regrettable that at this juncture, we cannot 
deal fully with important diplomatic issues because of political 
confusion at home." In particular, the government is concerned 
about the upcoming G-7 summit. Last year, (then) Prime Minister 
Kiichi Miyazawa was already a "lame duck" when he attended the 
Tokyo summit because he was forced to dissolve the House of 
Representatives for a snap general election immediately after 
the summit ended. The same Foreign Ministry source expressed 
anxiety, saying that the political confusion occurring just 
before the summits for two consecutive years "will had a 
detrimental effect on Japan's position in the international 
community." 
  G-7 summits are an ideal place to promote diplomacy among 
the 
leaders of the industrialized nations. Thus, the source said: 
"Repeated changes of government make it difficult to establish 
relations of trust between the Japanese prime minister and the 
leaders of other G-7 nations." Immediately before the G-7 
summit, the Japan-U.S. summit meeting is scheduled to mend 
bilateral ties, which have worsened since the breakdown of trade 
negotiations in February. Therefore, if elections for the next 
prime minister are delayed and as a result, if the government 
has to deal with the summit meeting with the virtual "absence of 
a prime minister," this will apparently be disadvantageous to 
Japanese diplomacy. 
  Many people question the idea of electing the new prime 
minister from among the members of the Social Democratic Party 
[SDPJ]. A top Foreign Ministry official said: "In view of 
diplomatic consistency, the idea is questionable." In 
particular, it is questioned whether the government will be able 
to take concerted actions with the United States in dealing with 
North Korea's suspected nuclear program if the SDPJ takes power. 
It is a crucial period for Japanese diplomacy. The nation has 
to deal with issues concerning the Japan-U.S. security system 
and its bid to become a permanent member of the UN Security 
Council. Thus, there is a strong call for establishing a stable 
government for the sake of Japanese diplomacy.

  [Text] Kozo Watanabe, acting secretary general of 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], held a news conference on the 
afternoon of 25 June and disclosed that the party plans to 
promptly wrap up policy consultations between the ruling 
coalition parties and the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ]. He indicated the party seeks to form a new coalition 
government that excludes the Liberal Democratic Party before the 
Naples summit which is to start on 8 July. Regarding the 
framework of the new government, Watanabe said: "We would like 
to treat with respect the feelings of the large majority of 
upper and lower house members who voted for `Tsutomu Hata' [as 
prime minister]." He thus expressed strong hopes for the SDPJ 
and the Sakigake [Harbinger Party] to return to the coalition.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Mass Resignation Triggers Suspicions"] </F>
  [Text] The administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
resigned en masse on 25 June. As a result, the second coalition 
administration under Prime Minister Hata came to an end in just 
less than two months since its inauguration on 28 April. 
  The direct cause of the abrupt ending was the fact that the 
Hata administration was forced to run a minority government due 
to an uproar over the formation of the parliamentary group 
"Kaishin." However, the high-handed political style of Shinseito 
Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and his followers and the lack of 
political leadership shown by the prime minister and cabinet 
ministers who repeatedly made controversial remarks, only to 
find themselves having to make apologies and retract their 
remarks, can also be counted among factors that led to the 
folding of the administration. 
  From early next week, ruling and opposition parties are 
likely to be engaged in a power struggle, perhaps with parties 
breaking up and further political realignment taking place. The 
ruling coalition parties plan to resume governmental and policy 
consultations with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], 
in hopes that the latter would return to the coalition. Should 
such consultations end in failure, however, the ruling coalition 
parties are also said to be considering reaching out to elements 
of both the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the SDPJ. 
  Meanwhile, the LDP is considering plans to form a coalition 
alliance with the SDPJ and other parties in a bid to regain 
power by taking advantage of the situation. 
  The SDPJ has insisted that a voluntary mass resignation by 
the Hata administration would be a precondition to its returning 
to the coalition. Considering that this condition has been 
satisfied, the SDPJ, which holds a decisive vote over the 
outcome of the current political turmoil, has indicated that it 
is prepared to return to the coalition, with the possibility of 
Hata's reelection in mind. 
  There is nothing significant about the current situation. It 
simply means that a power struggle will continue to rage with 
the ruling coalition parties, the LDP, and the SDPJ engaged in a 
"tripartite" deadlock. 
  The mass resignation of the Hata administration has left 
many 
unanswered questions. 
  In a news conference, the prime minister said: "Should the 
Diet be dissolved, it would create a month-long political 
vacuum. Under current circumstances, this must be avoided." He 
thus justified his decision on a "voluntary mass resignation" to 
avert a Diet dissolution and a subsequent general election. 
However, it is suspected that his true intentions were to 
prevent being forced to either resign en masse or dissolve the 
Diet due to the probable passage of a no-confidence motion, 
while leaving the possibility that he may be nominated as prime 
minister again. 
  There was a similar situation in the past. In this case, the 
administration of then Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama once 
resigned en masse in November 1955, saying that the nation's 
political foundation had changed as a result of the formation of 
the LDP through an alliance of liberal forces. After being 
reelected as prime minister, Hatoyama went on to serve his third 
term as prime minister. 
  In the case of the Hata administration, the line of argument 
that Hata and his colleagues apparently take is that their 
intentions pose no problems at all from the standpoint of the 
Constitution, the Cabinet Law, and other relevant matters. 
  At the time of the formation of the third Hatoyama 
administration, the SDPJ, which was an opposition party at the 
time, complained that "this is a plot to establish a permanent 
hold on power by conservative forces by prearranging the handing 
over of the reigns of government among themselves." 
  Although historical circumstances have changed, the mass 
resignation of the Hata administration gives a strong impression 
that this is merely a coalition tactic to muster a majority for 
maintaining a hold on power and to prearrange the handing over 
of the reigns of the government among themselves. 
  We have asserted that the current power struggle in which 
politicians simply try to gain a majority is intolerable and 
that in order to create a government with capable leaders, the 
lower house of the Diet should be dissolved in the not too 
distant a future to seek the judgment of the people. 
  With the mass resignation of the Hata administration, a Diet 
dissolution and a subsequent general election has been 
postponed. However, upon notification by the "House of 
Representatives Election Redistricting Council" regarding 
demarcation of new single seat constituencies for holding 
general elections under a new electoral system, the next 
administration must immediately convene an extraordinary Diet 
session to promptly enact the redistricting bill. It must then 
seek the will of the people after a designated period has passed 
for public acknowledgement of the enactment of the bill. 
  There is not much time to spend on forming a new 
administration. There are impending tasks -- including tax 
system reform, which primarily involves a consumption tax hike 
-- as well as the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, Japan-U.S. 
summit talks, and the Naples summit. 
  We cannot allow politicians to continue with their political 
struggles, which are based merely on grudges among themselves or 
on their likes and dislikes, and which totally ignore the will 
of the people; nor can we allow "job-executing cabinets" to 
continue on and on.

<F P=106> [Article by Hiroyuki Kawaguchi, senior researcher, Yomiuri </F>
Shimbun Research Center] 
  [Excerpts] Masanori Tanimoto, a candidate recommended by 
the leading coalition parties, won a gubernatorial election in 
Ishikawa Prefecture on 27 March, where the leading coalition 
parties and the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] crashed against 
each other for the first time following the collapse of the 
"1955 structure." Uniform local elections are scheduled to take 
place next spring, and an election for the upper house next 
summer. The recent election revealed what could be expected in 
showdowns in a series of future local elections and the next 
general election based on the system of small electoral 
districts. 
  According to the election results, Tanimoto received 288,085 
votes, winning over Hiroshi Ishikawa, a candidate recommended by 
the LDP, by a narrow margin of about 10,000 votes. Takashi 
Shimizu, chairman of the Prefectural Medical Association and a 
Communist-inclined independent, received only 48,417 votes. 
<H5>  A New Governor for the First Time in 31 Years </H5>
  For the people in Ishikawa Prefecture, the gubernatorial 
election came about quite unexpectedly, for the death of 
Governor Yoichi Nakanishi in a hospital (on 2 February) brought 
a drastic change in the situation. 
  Nakanishi in fact had occupied the top position in 
prefectural politics for 31 years since 1963. He planned to 
retire upon completion of his recent term in office. Maneuvering 
behind the scenes for new gubernatorial candidates was well in 
progress. But who could have predicted that the governor's death 
would open the curtain for election campaigns? 
  There is a unique conservative political climate in Ishikawa 
Prefecture that disfavors conflicts. Also, a heavy residue 
remained from the gubernatorial election three years ago, the 
so-called "Mori-Oku war of representatives." If possible, 
therefore, the people must have hoped for an election without 
any waves. But, then, why did the central-government-style 
showdown ensue, pitting Hiroshi Ishikawa, a Dietman from the 
upper house backed by the LDP, against Masanori Tanimoto, a 
former vice governor backed by the leading coalition parties? 
  In a sense, the nationwide trend in favor of change has also 
reached the conservative prefecture of Ishikawa. The situation 
seems to have been influenced by the change of power in the 
central government, which sent shock waves throughout Japan last 
year, and also by the system of small electoral districts to be 
introduced in the near future. 
  However, we should not overlook the fact that both the 
demonic aspect of elections and the political climate peculiar 
to Ishikawa pushed the candidates and their associates into a 
maelstrom of conflicting interests, and, as a result, the 
structure of a showdown gradually became apparent. The 
gubernatorial election in Ishikawa showed clear evidence that 
the politics in Japan was changing at the grassroots level. 
  Here is a vivid example that shows the conservative climate 
in Ishikawa Prefecture. Five Dietmen are elected from the 
prefecture: Yoshio Mori (LDP secretary general) from the first 
district, Keiwa Okuda (chairman of the lower house Committee on 
Rules and Administration and a member of Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party]), Yuzuru Shimazaki (chairman of the lower house 
Committee on Education and a member of the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ]), Misoji Sakamoto (former chief cabinet 
secretary and a member of the LDP) from the second district, and 
Tsutomu Kawara (former director general of the Defense Agency 
and a member of the LDP). This roster of five individuals became 
complete by 1972, and hasn't changed at all since then. No other 
prefecture shares this experience. 
  A similar situation exists in the business sector of the 
prefecture. Taro Miya (chairman of Daiwa Department Store) has 
been president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in 
Kanazawa since 1974. 
  Incidentally, former Governor Nakanishi became a vice 
governor, being reassigned from a chief of the Accounting 
Section at the Ministry of Home Affairs in June 1961. In 
February 1963 he ran for the governorship and won a 
gubernatorial election for the first time. Having been reelected 
every time since then, he won an election for the eighth time in 
February 1991, the most wins in the nation, and in July 1992 he 
broke the record of the longest tenure as governor held by the 
late Ryozo Okuda, former governor of Nara. 
  As a reason for his feat, some people point out the art of 
self-protection, a tradition since the Kaga clan. But, a reason 
should be traced to the regional character. Even today, the 
locals refer to those from other prefectures as "people from 
afar." 
  Furthermore, the recent election was influenced heavily by 
the serious residue of the gubernatorial election three years 
ago, in which Eitaro Sugiyama, the then vice governor, 
challenged Nakanishi, who was fighting to get elected for the 
eighth time, developing the campaign into a mud-slinging contest 
that divided the prefecture into two sides. Nakanishi had 
support from Okuda and Kawara; Sugiyama from Mori and the then 
opposition parties. This gubernatorial race was called the 
"Mori-Oku war of representatives." In the end, Nakanishi gained 
support from Miya, president of the Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry, and won the election by a narrow margin. After the 
election, however, the situation developed into numerous acts of 
revenge, ranging from demotion of the opposing officials of the 
prefecture to "withholding of job contracts" from the 
construction companies that were in opposition. 
<H5>  The Surge of Power To Stimulate Change [passage </H5>
omitted] 
  Kanazawa has an expression: The "Kanazawa Monroe Doctrine," 
signifying its "closed" nature. I've also heard an unfamiliar 
word, "Kokabukai," quite often. This word will be explained 
later, but it is likely to become an attribute for "change" in 
Kanazawa. 
  Even until now, there has been some indication of change in 
Ishikawa Prefecture, the "LDP's kingdom." In the upper house 
election five years ago, which was said to have "moved the 
mountains," Takashi Kurimori of Rengo [Japanese Private-Sector 
Trade Union Confederation] defeated Hitoshi Shimazaki of the 
LDP. Again, Shimazaki was a veteran statesman with a 19-year 
political career, having served as justice minister. His defeat 
was a prelude to change in the LDP kingdom. 
  However, a determining factor for the showdown in the recent 
gubernatorial election was the breakup of the Takeshita faction 
-- here, Okuda joined the forces creating Shinseito. The LDP had 
allocated its constituency in the first district for the lower 
house, clearly according to the native towns of its members -- 
Okuda to Kanazawa City and Mori to the South Kaga region. 
  The first time I heard the unfamiliar word, "Kokabukai," was 
while having quite an ordinary conversation with a housewife. I 
repeated, "Kokabukai?" And, then, she asked me in turn, "Don't 
you know that?" I was flabbergasted. "Kokabukai" is a group of 
associations organized, like dragnets, according the 51 
districts of elementary schools in Kanazawa. It is the LDP's 
network for gathering votes. It usually tries to promote a 
feeling of unity between the LDP and the voters; its members 
participate in various events sponsored by the LDP, sometimes in 
busloads. Its name is being used as a proper noun, and its 
superb ability to gather votes has been proved in various 
elections in the past. 
  Once the LDP's two seats in the first district for the lower 
house became established, allocation of constituents was 
finalized by a tacit understanding. Naturally, Kanazawa's 
"Kokabukai" was became Okuda's supporters' association. As a 
result, when Shinseito was formed, Okuda took the LDP's enormous 
constituency in Kanazawa, the chief city of the prefecture. 
  The LDP couldn't stomach this. The "Mori-Oku war" escalated, 
and its effect was felt in the recent gubernatorial election. In 
addition, as a coalition was formed in the central government, a 
liaison committee for the leading coalition parties at the 
prefectural level was established by the SDPJ, Shinseito, 
Komeito, the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and the United 
Social Democratic Party [USDP]. 
<H5>  Beating the Trump Card for Unified Candidacy </H5>
  Because of these circumstances and clashes, Misoji Sakamoto, 
chairman of the LDP's prefectural organization, took action 
quickly as soon as Governor Nakanishi was hospitalized on 4 
October last year. 
  He sounded out Keiwa Okuda of Shinseito regarding possible 
candidates for a future governor, saying, "We must avoid any 
vacuum in our prefectural politics." At that time, he had a 
reason to have absolute confidence in backing a unified 
candidate. He knew well the close human relationship between 
Okuda and Ishikawa, even when Hiroshi Ishikawa, who is a member 
of the upper house and was recommended by the LDP in the recent 
election, was named as a candidate three years ago. 
  "Itchu-Yonko" -- "Kanazawa First Middle School and Fourth 
Higher School under the old educational system" -- is considered 
as the elite path in Kanazawa. Sakamoto, Ishikawa, and Okuda are 
all from this elite path. Ishikawa and Okuda in particular are 
only one year apart, and "they have been close in a personal, 
trusting relationship from their childhood days." Also, Okuda 
became a Dietman from a local politician as a successor to the 
late Eiichi Sakata, former agriculture minister and a don in the 
political circles of the prefecture. Ishikawa had a kinship with 
Sakata. 
  As such, Okuda and Ishikawa are connected in many ways. 
Also, 
Ishikawa is a local, and after having served as a vice minister 
of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, he 
became a member of the upper house (in a proportional district) 
with support from the LDP. As a matter of course, he is deeply 
involved in prefectural politics, and has connections with 
Dietmen and other important people in the prefecture. Therefore, 
it is reasonable for Sakamoto to believe that "in any event, 
Okuda will support Ishikawa." 
  When he sounded out Okuda, Sakamoto explained in earnest the 
importance of backing a unified candidate: "There won't be any 
changes in policies. And, a power struggle that divides the 
prefecture into two camps will only cause troubles to the people 
in our prefecture. We shouldn't repeat that sort of thing. Also, 
we shouldn't bring the political conflicts of the central 
government into our local politics." 
  As expected, Okuda is said to have responded at that time, 
saying, "Would you recommend Mr. Ishikawa (as our unified 
candidate)?" In light of the mood against conflict permeating 
the prefecture and the close human relationship between the two 
individuals, it seemed that "the issue was resolved." 
  However, following the death of Governor Nakanishi on 2 
February, the situation gradually changed. As a statesman from 
the prefectural medical association, a young mayor, a famous 
village headman, and others showed their interests in running 
for governorship, and Ishikawa's name began to be mentioned as 
the LDP's official candidate, a sense of crisis developed within 
Shinseito and the SDPJ. 
  Hiroshi Kanahara, the acting chairman of Shinseito's 
prefectural federation, was busy trying to make over "Kokabukai" 
into an organization to support Okuda. Many people sent a 
message to him, saying, "If we remain submissive to the LDP and 
don't fight, our organization will become moribund." Okuda began 
to waver a little, also. Because of this, he didn't accept any 
requests for press or TV interviews, saying, "I need to form a 
clear view of the situation first." 
  Reflecting on this, Takeshi Ikeda, chairman of the SDPJ's 
prefectural headquarters that is part of the conference for 
representatives of the liaison committee for the leading 
coalition parties, says, "We were also under pressure from 
below. We had to do something, but we didn't know what to do." 
He adds: "Then, we thought it necessary first to find out what 
the people in our prefecture were thinking. We came up with an 
idea of surveying public opinion by randomly selecting 
individuals, and asked our office to study the cost and other 
aspects of conducting such a survey." In the meantime, Yutaka 
Kurihara, vice chairman, submitted this idea to the executive 
committee of the liaison committee, which in turn began to take 
action in earnest for the gubernatorial election. 
<H5>  A Symposium That Changed the Course </H5>
  The liaison committee for the leading coalition parties, 
however, is in a sense only "glasswork" like the central 
government, a [fragile] collection of disparate groups. As a 
result of outspoken discussions, it was decided as a compromise, 
based on the proposal for a survey of public opinion, that they 
would convene a "symposium to discuss an ideal governor for 
Ishikawa Prefecture" on 12 February, and that they would 
concurrently conduct a questionnaire survey of those attending. 
They were to approach seven panelists individually, and they 
contacted the LDP and obtained its consent. 
  In retrospect, however, this rather ordinary idea of having 
a 
symposium and a questionnaire survey turned out to be an 
important watershed in determining the course of selecting a 
gubernatorial candidate. It snowed heavily on the day of the 
symposium, but despite the worry about its effect on attendance, 
about 600 people gathered. During the symposium, various 
opinions were actively exchanged: "I don't consider it 
reasonable to follow the past practice of selecting candidates 
at the central government level"; "How about calling for 
candidates publicly"; and so on. There were also many people who 
wanted to speak during the question and answer period. The 
moderator was amazed. 
  The response rate for the questionnaire survey was 
excellent; 
480 people responded. What pleased the people from the leading 
coalition parties most were the contents of the response: To the 
question, "How do you like the relationship between the governor 
and the prefecture to be?" 46.1 percent of the respondents 
answered that "We have to seek a qualified individual anywhere, 
not just from within our prefecture." This was well beyond the 
response rate of 39.6 percent for the response that "The 
governor should be a person who was born and raised in the 
prefecture, and who is taking an active part in the prefectural 
affairs." Also, to the question on "the candidate's stance on 
party affiliation," 47.4 percent of the respondents answered 
that "the candidate as a person is more important than his party 
affiliation." This was well above the response rate of 26.1 
percent for the answer, "The candidate can belong to any party 
as long as he can carry out the prefectural politics justly and 
fairly." 
  Are these responses the result of an influence left by the 
former governor, who was from outside the prefecture and had 
prevailed in the prefectural politics for 31 years? It could be 
a strategic victory if the leading coalition parties were 
considering at that time to support Vice Governor Masanori 
Tanimoto, who shared a similar background. Tanimoto was from 
Hyogo Prefecture, and was transferred from his position as a 
section chief at the Ministry of Home Affairs to serve as vice 
governor -- he had been on his new post for only two years and 
three months. 
  On the other hand, the survey results were rather mortifying 
for Ishikawa, who is a local and a member of the LDP and the 
upper house. They gave the leading coalition parties a 
justifiable reason "to oppose Mr. Ishikawa." They also made it 
impossible for the LDP to openly contradict this reason. 
  Were this symposium and the questionnaire survey contrived 
in 
any way? To answer this question, I met one of the panelists, 
Yoshiko Hayakawa, and asked her candidly, "Did you receive any 
requests as to what you might say?" She responded rather 
vacantly: "Probably, it was four days before [the symposium] 
when Mr. Ikeda (chairman of the SDPJ's prefectural committee) 
telephoned me. I said to him, `As I'm a lone wolf (a conference 
interpreter), I may start saying something totally unexpected.' 
Then, he said, `You can say whatever you want.' So, I accepted 
the invitation." 
  To be sure, there were some leading questions in the 
questionnaire survey. Judging from the stories told by the 
officials of the leading coalition parties, however, selection 
of candidates had not been negotiated among the parties at that 
time. In fact, the situation was that the entire process of 
candidate selection had not yet reached the stage of 
negotiation. Ironically, this tardiness, compared to the LDP's 
swift action, was later to become an important guidepost as well. 
  For a moment, let's move the stage back to Tokyo. As the 
deadline for notification [of candidates] was approaching, the 
LDP members probably felt that there was not much time left. On 
14 February, Sakamoto asked Okuda, Shimazaki, and Kurimori--all 
are members of the Diet from the leading coalition parties--to 
gather in the Diet building and formally asked for their 
cooperation to decide on a unified candidate. He asked them also 
to begin selecting a candidate at the beginning of the following 
week. 
  It has been said that no particular candidates were 
mentioned 
during the meeting. However, Sakamoto said with full confidence: 
"Those who gathered today are all honest people. Although they 
didn't name any candidates, they will be able to come to terms 
with each other easily." Okuda, on the other hand, let his 
doubts be known, saying, "Will we be able to overcome all 
hurdles? I don't think it is that easy." 
  In the final analysis, this meeting in Tokyo triggered a 
breakup. Komeito, the DSP, and the SDPJ in succession issued a 
statement of "rejection of unified candidacy," saying, "In light 
of the policy line drawn from the symposium of prefectural 
citizens, we cannot accept a Dietman candidate chosen in Tokyo." 
In other words, the meeting provided the leading coalition 
parties with another "justifiable reason" to "oppose selection 
of a candidate at the central level." 
  Of course, the political motive of each party is obvious. 
Yuzuru Shimazaki, a Dietman from the SDPJ, made an honest 
confession: "If Mr. Okuda of Shinseito bands together with the 
LDP in Tokyo, our side will become stripped. Therefore, we tried 
to place our first priority on the framework of the leading 
coalition parties." Beaming, he said, "Honestly, I was surprised 
to discover that more than 45 percent of the respondents to the 
questionnaire survey conducted at the symposium felt it 
unnecessary for their governor to be from their own prefecture." 
He added further, "Times have changed, but the LDP refuses to 
become an opposition party, just as we are failing to become 
leading parties. We are no longer in the era when candidates for 
governor were chosen at the central government level." He 
probably wanted to emphasize the importance of the selection 
process itself. 
<H5>  The LDP Took Decisive Action </H5>
  Okuda didn't make his stance clear even around that time. 
Keigo Ishimoto, the general secretary of the LDP's prefectural 
federation, vented his frustration: "I can't stand the teasing 
tactics any longer. If we keep going like this, our federation 
will break apart internally." At last on 21 February, the LDP 
took decisive action by holding a large-scale meeting in Tokyo 
with Diet members and the executives of the prefectural 
federation. They decided to ask Ishikawa to run for governor. At 
the same time, they also proposed to the leading coalition 
parties to make a joint recommendation. 
  To this, Ishikawa replied curtly, "I'll give it serious 
consideration." He didn't make his intention clear. As 
"unification" [of candidacy] was a condition agreed upon during 
the previous sounding, he might have felt somehow that "the 
promise was not kept." 
  Tsutomu Kawara, an LDP Dietman, explains: "Our procedure 
might have been deficient. We should have made our points clear 
in our public speeches why we needed Mr. Ishikawa now and why we 
had to make adjustments. To the members of the SDPJ, Shinseito, 
Komeito, and the DSP who had been affected by the action taken 
by the coalition government, we gave them a chance to enjoy 
their get-together." As a result, the leading coalition parties 
issued a statement of denunciation and immediately held a 
liaison conference to select an opposing candidate. 
  They came up with five possible candidates, including a 
college professor, a high-ranking government official, and a 
vice governor. In the end, Tanimoto was judged to be "an ideal 
candidate for governor at the present time." On 24 February, the 
leading coalition parties made an official request to Tanimoto 
to run for governor. However, Tanimoto replied simply, "I 
consider it a very important request," and continued his duty as 
acting governor. 
  By this time, Ishikawa made up his mind clearly to run for 
governorship, saying, "It is regrettable that unification was 
not achieved." According to a person within the LDP, a wavering 
Ishikawa finally made the decision because he was pressured by 
his local supporters who said, "You once were a vice minister. 
If you are sideswiped by a section chief (i.e., Mr. Tanimoto), 
you won't be able to walk about the town of Kanazawa at ease." 
  Even around this time, a dominant opinion within the LDP was 
that "Mr. Tanimoto will probably not accept the request." As the 
LDP holds the majority of seats in the prefectural assembly in 
Ishikawa, "even if he [Tanimoto] wins, he will have a hellish 
time dealing with the assembly." 
  However, Okuda indicated his intention to back Tanimoto 
during the rally for establishment of Shinseito in Mikawa on 27 
February: "I would like to recommend the second-highest ranking 
individual, who has a promising future, rather than someone who 
was once a grand champion." This left no room for further 
negotiation. Tanimoto also made it clear that he would step 
forward as a candidate. 
  Kanahara of Shinseito, who served as campaign manager for 
Tanimoto, says, "Mr. Tanimoto must have been shocked when we 
asked him to become a candidate. I'm so glad that he decided to 
run." Tanimoto speaks of the reason for his decision sparingly: 
"Because my wife let me make up my mind...." As he had been 
governing the prefectural politics since Nakanishi was 
hospitalized in October last year, he probably decided to bet on 
the attractiveness of the governorship, rather than on the 
hellish future of dealing with the assembly. 
  For Yoshiro Mori, LDP secretary general, it was the worst 
outcome. Considering his relationship with Okuda, he delegated 
all negotiations to Sakamoto, chairman of the prefectural 
federation. He remained as a standby, saying, "I'll come forward 
if there is any chance for readjustment at the last minute." He 
lost this chance forever. But, as soon as he foresaw the coming 
fight, he didn't let his fighting spirit go unnoticed: "The 
belligerent attitude three years ago killed the governor 
(Nakanishi). This time again, they are trying to use the 
gubernatorial election as a means to expand their political 
power. I can't let that happen." 
  It was only on 7 March that Okuda finally decided to 
disclose 
his thoughts on the [election] process. At the office of the 
lower house Committee on Rules and Administration, he said as 
follows, choosing his words carefully: 
  "Mr. Ishikawa is my long-time friend. His character, 
personality, knowledge, and his intention to remain in Ishikawa 
Prefecture till the end -- all this considered, I still think 
he's best suited as governor. But, Mr. Tanimoto is also a very 
capable man. In any event, politics at the central government 
has been changing, and this change is pressing on us also. 
Throughout the prefectural assembly and supporters' 
associations, there has been a rise of the fighting spirit 
[against the LDP]. I myself made a difficult decision, thinking 
about how tightly the leading coalition parties could unite 
during this election. If things didn't go quite right, the 
solidarity would prove not to be genuine." 
  No doubt, he must have agonized over his deep personal 
relationship with Ishikawa. On the other hand, however, he 
seriously considered protecting the supporters' 
organization--restructuring it as the Shinseito 
organization--and solidifying the leading coalition parties for 
elections under the system of small electoral districts. He 
[Okuda] is shrewd--at the time of the breakup of the Tanaka 
faction, he organized the middle-of-the-roaders and eventually 
went for Noboru Takeshita, and he later joined Shinseito after 
the breakup of the Takeshita faction. He already finished 
transforming all of the 51 "Kokabukai" in Kanazawa City into the 
"Shinseito Kokabukai," establishing "Shinseito Kanazawa." 
Probably because of this, he said with confidence, "If the LDP 
loses this election, its organization will become very shaky." 
<H5>  The Lineup, Vying for the System of Small Electoral Districts </H5>
  Countering this, however, the LDP had also established its 
own "LDP Kokabukai" in every school district, although far less 
in membership. As a result, "Kokabukai," the famous word in 
Kanazawa City, is no longer a proper noun. As a harbinger of a 
series of political restructuring at the central government, 
this type of restructuring of local organizations is likely to 
spread quickly throughout the nation. 
  Also, as soon as it was known that the election battle would 
take place, the LDP came up with a series of strategic measures 
based on the assumption of introduction of the system of small 
electoral districts. First, it brought forward a strategy to 
draw upon the full power of Dietmen by creating a tripartite 
system of campaign headquarters in Kanazawa, Kaga, and Noto. 
This system is sure to become a national model for future 
elections of governors and members of the upper house. 
  Here, the leading coalition parties are having a difficult 
time. Ikeda of the SDPJ made a grave comment: "In gubernatorial 
elections, we have experienced a joint ride many times, so I 
don't see any problems here. But, it won't be that easy in a 
small electoral district. The results of the recent election 
will become a good reference point in selecting candidates for 
small districts. If they gobble up good districts only, like 
assigning Mr. Okuda to the new first district, and the SDPJ to 
somewhere else, we won't be able to stand it. We'll have to talk 
seriously when the time comes." 
  Yet, he added: "The recent election is a touchstone. As we 
have to win at any cost, we are not thinking about the future. 
Rengo decided for the first time to initiate a drive for 
campaign contribution of 500 yen [per person]." In future 
elections in small districts, this kind of activity should 
become increasingly common. 
  During the gathering of its Hakui branch office members to 
encourage the candidate at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry 
Hall in Hakui, the LDP, which monopolizes two seats in Noto, 
orchestrated a stage performance of having Sakamoto and Kawara 
welcome and shake hands with Ishikawa for the first time in 
front of the supporters. At this, the supporters applauded. 
  Although it used to be said that "the worst enemy of an LDP 
Dietman in a medium-constituency district is another LDP 
Dietman," the two [Sakamoto and Kawara] rode amicably in the 
same loudspeaker car. Seemingly embarrassed, however, Sakamoto 
feigned ignorance and said, "The gubernatorial election is our 
cause. If you don't agree with this cause, you'll be considered 
an enemy." On the other hand, Kawara explained the fact of the 
matter honestly: "We don't know who will be chosen (as a 
candidate for the new small third district), but we decided to 
establish a trusting relationship among the interested parties." 
  Once chosen as a candidate in a small district, how 
completely you take the political foundation of the other 
Dietman from the same party will become a determining factor in 
winning the election. Therefore, we will be likely to see this 
kind of scene all over the nation. [passage omitted] 
  The ceremonies at both camps in the morning of the 
notification date on 10 March were quite befitting as an 
oncoming battle between the leading coalition parties and the 
LDP. At the Tanimoto camp, an encouraging telegram from the 
prime minister was read aloud, boosting spirits: "This will have 
an important effect on the future of the coalition government as 
well. We must win for sure. Just as we changed the central 
government, we must also change local governments." 
  At the Ishikawa camp, all Dietmen from the prefecture were 
present. In addition, three members of the upper house, who are 
Ishikawa's colleagues and from outside the prefecture, including 
Hiroshi Miyazawa, showed up at the ceremony and electrified the 
supporters. 
  An election campaign, however, can be quite a cruel 
experience for certain individuals. As there is no predicting 
the eventual outcome of the election, many heads of local 
governments, including mayors of cities, towns, and villages, 
were confused and determined to remain silent. Almost tearfully, 
therefore, Kanazawa Mayor Tamotsu Yamaide, who has a support 
base of the "big alliance" between the LDP and the coalition 
parties, had to make "opening remarks for both ceremonies." 
First, at the ceremony for candidate Tanimoto at Ishikawa 
Gokoku Shrine, he praised the candidate: "I had the pleasure of 
working with Mr. Tanimoto. He understands the pains at the local 
government level. He is a wonderful man." Then, 40 minutes later 
at the ceremony for candidate Ishikawa at Oyama Shrine, he began 
similarly, showing his solicitude in a desperate attempt: "Mr. 
Ishikawa has experience in national politics. I'm sure he will 
satisfy our expectations. He is a wonderful man." 
<H5>  Double Recommendation in Desperation </H5>
  Possibly, businessmen in the prefecture were much more 
desperate than others. As their position was not clear even on 
the notification day, I requested telephone interviews to the 
offices of President Miya of Kanazawa Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry; Vice President Toshio Magara, president of Magara 
Construction; and so on. Every one of their offices responded: 
"He is on a business trip." 
  The mystery was solved when I saw the list of supporters for 
each candidate. Both lists for Tanimoto and Ishikawa contained 
the names of leading businessmen in the prefecture, including 
Miya, Magara, Chairman Heiji Etsuma (president of Tsudagoma 
Industries) of the Prefectural Management Association, and 
Executive Secretary Rioji Shibuya (chairman of Shibuya 
Industries) of the Kanazawa branch of the Keizai Doyukai [Japan 
Association of Corporate Executives]. In short, they all made a 
double recommendation. 
  One of the leading businessmen in the prefecture, whom I 
finally managed to interview that night, confided: "The reason 
we were troubled by the recent election is not only that the 
outcome was difficult to predict, but also that we know both 
candidates very well. Also, due to the recession, we couldn't 
make contributions, and knowing what had happened in the 
election three years ago, we were afraid to speak up. We simply 
remained as observers. We couldn't comment [on the election]. 
`Being out on a business trip' has been a tacit agreement among 
us. I also am supposed to be `on a business trip' since 
yesterday." 
  The election battle increased in intensity as each of the 
two 
camps continued to invite big figures from the central 
government. Voting day finally arrived. Despite Ishikawa's last 
spurt, the candidate from the leading coalition parties won the 
election. As soon as the election results became known, I 
remembered various materials I had collected for this article, 
and couldn't stop thinking about the future with a gloomy 
feeling, wondering if this election would leave a heavy residue 
again. [passage omitted] 
  When will the Japanese people reason out "political fights" 
as "political fights," enabling both friends and foes to "wine 
and dine at the same table"? If they can't do that, a small 
electoral district--one man, one district--will always be a hell.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 28 Jun Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] On 27 June the dollar fell below 100 yen on the 
Tokyo Exchange Market and this all-time low in the dollar's 
value against the yen hit the Hata cabinet -- which continued to 
carry out its duties even after Prime Minister Hata announced 
his cabinet would resign en masse. Prime Minister Hata 
immediately called Deputy Finance Minister Kosuke Nakahira; 
Takashi Kato, director of the International Finance Bureau of 
the Finance Ministry; and Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Ishihara to the prime minister's official residence to discuss 
ways to deal with the sharp rise in the yen's exchange rate 
against the dollar. After being briefed on the response and 
coordinated intervention made by other industrialized nations 
and the situation on foreign exchange markets, the prime 
minister told them that as Japanese measures to deal with the 
yen's appreciation: "It is important to execute the budget 
steadily and to further relax regulations." Regarding holding 
an emergency meeting of cabinet members in charge of economic 
affairs to discuss ways to deal with the yen's appreciation, the 
prime minister showed no intention of doing so, saying: "I do 
not want to hold a meeting that could send a mistaken message to 
foreign exchange markets. What matters is to execute the budget 
and relax regulations in a visible way."

<F P=106> [Article by economic reporter Junichi Abe: "Political </F>
Responsibility, What To Do About Economic Reform--Choosing 
Options That Address an Aging Society"] 
  [Text] Following the conference of finance ministers and 
central bank governors of the seven advanced industrial nations 
(G-7) that opened in Washington on 24 April, Secretary of the 
Treasury Lloyd Bentsen, in seeking concrete movement by Japan 
toward drastic reform of its tax system which is linked to 
economic stimulus, said, "Reducing the income tax will increase 
the income of consumers and serve to correct the foreign trade 
balance." 
  Realization of tax reform within the year is the biggest 
international commitment the new government is being urged to 
accept. One could say that because the Hosokawa administration 
was the "government of political reform," the new Hata 
administration's fate is to be the "government of tax reform." 
  A policy accord was at last reached early on 22 April by the 
coalition parties who had steered a difficult course through tax 
reform which put forth a "radical reform of the tax system 
focused on raising the direct tax rate, including a 
restructuring of the current consumption tax and mechanisms for 
reducing the direct income tax." This ought to have advanced tax 
reform a step forward, but any sense of victory on the part of 
the coalition parties and the Ministry of Finance [MOF] was 
scant. 
  At the coalition party tax reform conference, lower house 
member Murai (Shinseito), who serves as chairman of the 
subcommittee on the tax system, commented, "This is a case where 
we could not conclude without arguing over why the consumption 
tax rate was being raised after we had said we had achieved a 
policy accord." This resulted in a total stalemate. 
  The MOF cautioned, "Even though we are in agreement in 
outline, when we get into the discussion of specific areas such 
as the tax rate and the timing of the increase, opposition 
resurfaces" (a senior official in the Tax Bureau). 
  Standing in the way of prospects for tax reform is not just 
the departure of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] 
from the coalition government. "It's been okay up to now to 
think about the need somehow for tax reform, with a national 
debt reaching 200 trillion yen and how this is for the public 
welfare, but when it comes to each member's discussing it in his 
election district, can he do it as simply as that?" (Chairman 
Murai). The distress of each party increases with the prospect 
of actually adding tax reform to the schedule. 
  "A hike in the new consumption tax rate to correct a 
deficiency in the revenue resources for the public welfare 
cannot be avoided." The secretary general of the SDPJ's Research 
Commission on the Tax System, Harumichi Hosoya, on 12 April, 
explained that having created "the '89 Club" in opposition to 
the consumption tax, which gave their candidates in the 1989 
upper house election an overwhelming victory, the SDPJ was 
prepared to oppose any increase. He also said that many, 
contrary to expectations, were inclined toward showing an 
appreciation of the issues. Although clearly the disparity among 
the coalition parties regarding tax reform is narrow, how to 
proceed is still unclear. 
  In response to the Ministry of Health and Welfare's "Vision 
of the Public Welfare in the 21st Century," which says that an 
increase in the public burden is unavoidable in order to finance 
social guarantees for an aging society, there are members of the 
government's Research Commission on the Tax System who say, "As 
things go, we do not understand if this concept has taken into 
account to what degree welfare services will be obtainable. We 
have no means to choose." 
  At a plenary session of the Research Commission on the Tax 
System held on 15 April, one after another, beginning with 
delegate Haruo Shimada (a Keio University professor), there was 
impassioned pointing out of the fact that while welfare services 
are one of the bases for raising the consumption tax, none of 
the basic supporting data has been made public. 
  To obtain the understanding of the public on tax reform it 
will be necessary to show them the options and the form to be 
taken by future public services. With the MOF saying, "There 
aren't enough resources," a prerequisite for tax reform is 
openly grappling with fiscal reform and revising the unfair tax 
system. 
  It can be said that the process of "responsible reform" is 
to 
obtain public understanding of the radical reform needed for the 
tax system and the accompanying pain through exhaustive 
explanation. One more obligation we can seek of the government 
is that it not prepare the way for tax reform using honeyed 
words on the electorate, but that it address the resources 
available to and burdens facing an aging society and then make 
"responsible choices." 
  There are many issues in addition to tax reform which the 
government should be pressed to take responsibility for and 
decide. The question is being asked how the coalition government 
will discharge its responsibilities following the defection of 
the Socialist Party to achieve a radical review of fiscal 
reform, deregulation, and the food management system in the face 
of bureaucratic resistance.

<F P=106> [Article by economic reporter Junichi Maruyama: "What To Do </F>
About Economic Reform--`Foreign Commitment,' Which Is Increasing 
the Intensity"] 
  [Text] The "coalition defection shock" of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] offered the United States a 
greater surprise than did the coming to power of a new 
government. 
  White House press secretary Didi Meyers, who received the 
report just before a press conference held on 25 April, said, 
"We will have to watch the situation in Japan closely as it 
unfolds," at the same time exhibiting an expression of 
bewilderment over the unanticipated turmoil inside the Japanese 
Government. THE WASHINGTON POST on page 1 ran the headline, 
"Japan's Government Coalition Collapses," and reported that a 
stalemate in Japanese policy would continue for months. 
  The U.S. Government on 22 April issued an unusual "welcoming 
statement" to Prime Minister Hata without waiting for him to 
receive his nomination as prime minister in the Diet. Mike 
McCurry, the U.S. State Department press secretary, praised the 
prime minister as "the man who bears the responsibility for 
wrestling with issues involved in the U.S.-Japan relationship." 
This is because Prime Minister Hata who has intimate knowledge 
of negotiations with the United States and has accumulated 
cabinet experience both as finance minister and foreign minister 
is seen as suited to effecting the opening of Japan's markets 
and reducing the trade surplus. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, at a meeting with 
Foreign Minister Hata in Marrakech, Morocco, on 15 April 
"consistently conducted himself in a gentlemanly fashion we 
haven't seen before" (the head of MITI). This was because 
Kantor, recognizing Foreign Minister Hata as the next prime 
minister, had an aim of obtaining a pledge regarding Japanese 
concessions in order to reopen the stalled trade talks. 
  But, belying the gentle manner, the demands Representative 
Kantor set forth were harsh. He presented three conditions for 
reopening comprehensive talks: creating yardsticks, expanded the 
introduction of foreign goods and services, and a review of the 
midrange macroeconomic plan aimed at reducing the trade surplus. 
  It was requested in discussions between Kantor and Hata and 
with President Gore about the same time that there be close 
cooperation between the United States and Japan on the nuclear 
issue involving the People's Democratic Republic of Korea (North 
Korea). The fact that, on returning to Japan, Prime Minister 
Hata at the Shinseito's policy conference of the coalition 
parties persisted in strongly emphasizing enactment of tax 
reform and the fulfilling of international obligations regarding 
the issue of North Korea was due to the shackles put on the 
deputy prime minister of Japan by the United States at Marrakech. 
  However, given the strong fears dogging the minority 
government with the defection of the SDPJ from the coalition 
government, it will not do for the scenario depicted by Prime 
Minister Hata and expected by the United States to collapse 
forthwith. The Hata government has decided to issue a decision 
by the end of June regarding the overlay of a capital investment 
plan for public works with a permanent tax reduction through tax 
reform. Taking such a stand, he would like to have comprehensive 
discussions reopen and bring about a final agreement for them by 
the July Naples summit (the G-7 meeting of the heads of the 
advanced industrial nations). 
  However, should the SDPJ, which defected from the coalition, 
still oppose a hike in the consumption tax to overcome reduced 
tax revenue, tax reform will be brought to a standstill. Without 
the prospect of realizing a permanent tax reduction, 
comprehensive discussions with the United States cannot be 
reopened. Furthermore, should Japan be unable to set forth a 
policy for effectively reducing its trade surplus at the summit 
where "growth and employment" will be key themes, there is fear 
that Japan will be subject to concerted denunciation. 
  The United States and Europe have both accepted deregulation 
that incorporates a general plan for international economic 
reform as an international commitment. But, if the Hata 
government's centripetal force is weakened and bureaucratic 
resistance is not controlled, bold deregulation will be 
difficult. 
  Noboru Hatakeyama, former MITI negotiator and until last 
year 
in the forefront of U.S.-Japan negotiations, counseled that "it 
will not be acceptable to say that if the government does not 
come up with concrete indicators it is because the bureaucracy 
wouldn't budge." Tsuyoshi Kondo, director of Itochu 
Corporation's Politics and Economics Institute, pleaded with the 
new government "to offer slogans easily understood both 
domestically and abroad and to maintain the ability to gather 
information outside bureaucratic channels." 
  U.S.-Japan trade negotiations currently are in the unusual 
position of being hands off to the bureaucrats. Should this 
continue, it must be allowed that US-Japan relations as a whole 
will slip into a precarious position. However, I don't see the 
prospects for Prime Minister Hata overcoming a weak political 
base at home and somehow being able to find a way to extricate 
himself from tempestuous international relations.

<F P=106> [By Motoyasu Matsumoto, New York] </F>
  [Text] Honda Motor has decided to produce passenger cars in 
Mexico. Honda already has plants in the United States and 
Canada, and will be the first Japanese motor vehicle maker with 
production centers in all three countries, coming under the 
cognizance of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) 
which went into effect in January 1994. In proceeding with its 
plant in Mexico, Honda was most concerned about the reaction 
from the United States and Canada. Although economic borders 
have been deemphasized by NAFTA, national boundaries still exist 
in a strict political sense. The events that transpired prior to 
the announcement of Honda's plans remind Japanese firms of these 
routine realities. 
  The ceremony to sign the agreement for construction of the 
passenger car plant was held in the afternoon of 9 May (early 
morning on the 10th, Japan time) at the Mexican presidential 
office. Honda was represented at the ceremony by Vice President 
Hidemune Munekuni and Managing Director Takakazu Amemiya 
stationed in the United States as well as Deputy Secretary of 
Commerce and Industry Ugarte of Mexico. The press conference 
that was to be held by the Honda representatives after the 
ceremony was canceled because the latter had run behind 
schedule, but the Mexican side displayed a pervasive welcoming 
mood. 
  According to the plans, Honda will build a passenger car 
plant adjacent to its motorcycle plant located on the outskirts 
of Guadalajara, the second-largest city in Mexico. The project 
is valued at $50 million and will commence in July of this year. 
Production of the midsized "Accords" will start in November 1995 
at an annual production rate of 15,000 units a year, earmarked 
for sale in Mexico. In the future, production will be increased 
to 30,000 units a year to provide for exports to Central and 
South America. 
  From the Mexican Government's perspective, Honda's plans 
will 
provide 500 jobs and a source for earning foreign currency. They 
will also have a major impact on the development of parts 
industries. It can be said that it is only logical that the 
government welcomes Honda's new plant. However, Honda itself was 
more concerned with the reaction from the United States and 
Canada. 
  During the NAFTA debate of last fall, a heated exchange of 
views took place in the U.S. Congress. Congressmen opposed to 
NAFTA used Japan as the primary basis for their position, 
arguing, "NAFTA will benefit only Japanese businesses, which 
will take advantage of the low labor rates in their Mexican 
plants to wage an export offensive on the United States." 
  In the end, NAFTA passed both houses of Congress with the 
majority in favor of the bill in both chambers. However, many 
congressmen who were opposed to NAFTA were perennially critical 
of Japanese cars and benefited from political support from the 
United Auto Workers (UAW). Honda's opening of an automobile 
plant in Mexico could influence U.S. congressional hardliners on 
Japan and have a subtle effect on the course of the Japan-U.S. 
trade talks. 
  Honda had perceived the existence of the above-discussed 
atmosphere and has taken a cautionary stance from early on as 
reflected in Vice President Munekuni's statement, "Even if Honda 
decides to open an automotive plant in Mexico, it will have 
nothing to do with NAFTA." The recent announcement of the plant 
opening did not contain any reference to NAFTA. Additionally, 
the announcement included the statement, "There are no plans to 
export to the United States or Canada." This one statement runs 
the risk of limiting Honda in the future if the political or 
economic situation should undergo changes in the future. 
However, Honda felt it was necessary to send a message of its 
intentions to U.S. congressional and UAW sources even though it 
was aware of that risk. 
  Potential problems also lurked in Canada. Honda's Plant No. 
1 
and Plant No. 2 in Ohio have a combined annual capacity of 
500,000 vehicles, while its Canadian plant has a capacity of 
only 100,000 units, which is far from the break-even point of 
200,000 units. Canadian Government sources expressed concern, 
saying, "We hope you have no intent of closing the Canadian 
plant after opening the Mexican plant." 
  Honda responded to such concerns. On 4 May, it announced 
that 
"Civics" produced at the Canadian plant would be exported to 
Taiwan and Brazil. The timing of the announcement was superb as 
it was made five days before the news release on the Mexican 
plant. The number of exports will total only about 1,000 units 
during the year, but the announcement served to appease the 
Canadian government. Designating the Mexican plant for 
production of the midsized Accord rather than the small Civic 
was an action taken to distinguish the Mexican plant from the 
Canadian plant, which specializes in production of the Civic. 
  Honda had initiated its feasibility study for the Mexican 
plant in 1992, before the debate on NAFTA assumed serious 
proportions. Mexico's laws prohibit the import and sales of 
vehicles made by manufacturers that do not operate plants in 
that country. The foremost objective of opening a plant in 
Mexico was to establish the basis for participating in the 
Mexican automotive market, which has a promising future. 
Notwithstanding, Honda needed to recognize the political 
consideration with respect to the United States and Canada. 
  The implementation of NAFTA unified the U.S., Canadian, and 
Mexican markets and lowered economic barriers. Tariffs 
applicable to the automotive sector were either abolished or 
reduced. The change provided for a significant expansion of 
options available to private businesses that seek globalization 
of their activities. 
  However, NAFTA also has the effect of allowing immediate 
expansion of Mexican business activities in the U.S. and 
Canadian markets. Thus, it is only logical that the U.S. and 
Canadian Governments show concern about movements by 
Mexican-based Japanese businesses. Lowering of national economic 
barriers has resulted in the "extension" of political influence 
beyond national borders. Honda officials admit, "If NAFTA did 
not exist, we would not have to exercise so much concern about 
U.S. and Canadian positions." 
  Honda is a pacesetter for globalization of Japanese 
businesses. Despite its posture in that respect, Honda has been 
forced to exercise a higher degree of political sensitivity than 
that of the past. Japanese businesses are plagued by an ironic 
phenomenon wherein the lowering of economic barriers has been 
replaced by the need to exercise strong awareness of political 
barriers.

<F P=106> [By Motoyasu Matsumoto, New York] </F>
  [Text] The Honda Canadian plant located in Alliston, 
Ontario Province, reached a milestone in its localization 
strategy. It began exporting small "Civic" sedans to Brazil and 
Taiwan. In the past, all passenger cars produced at that plant 
were sold in the United States and Canada. The move by Honda has 
served as a significant incentive to the 1,600 employees of the 
plant in that "the quality of Canadian-built Civics will be 
tested in overseas markets for the first time." 
  The Canadian plant is located in a rural area about 90 
minutes north of Toronto. Toyota and Suzuki also have production 
plants in Canada, but, in the fall of 1986, Honda was the first 
Japanese automaker to locate in Canada. Honda will also lead the 
other Japanese makers in exporting to points other than the 
United States. 
  At the beginning of this year an influential Canadian 
newspaper published an article saying, "It appears Honda may be 
withdrawing from the Canadian market." The article was based on 
the implementation of NAFTA in January 1994. NAFTA provided for 
the integration of the Canadian, U.S., and Mexican markets. If 
production of small cars were centralized in Mexico, where labor 
is cheap, and sold throughout North America, Honda could enhance 
its profitability by improving its price competitiveness. 
Speculation began to circulate in Canadian industry that "Honda 
was going to open plants in Mexico, but close plants in Canada." 
  "The idea of closing our plant is absolutely incorrect," 
says 
plant manager Shinichi Kawai as he laughs off the speculation. 
The initiation of exports to Brazil and Taiwan is a response to 
such rumors. Honda has established a clear-cut posture of 
contributing to the local economy by using the Canadian plant to 
produce exports. The formal announcement of the Mexican plant 
early this month served to dispel speculation and calm rumors 
about the closing of the Canadian plant. 
  Currently, the Canadian plant produces a combined total of 
100,000 Civics a year in the three-door hatchback and two-door 
coupe versions. The plant operates at one-half of what is 
considered to be a break-even point of 200,000 units a year. A 
tour of the plant reveals that it has only one pressing machine 
line and gives one the impression that it is a compact 
operation. That operating level was the basis for inspiring talk 
of a shutdown. 
  However, Mr. Kawai makes the unusual revelation that 
"accumulated losses were worked off in mid-1993." The reason why 
the plant was able to produce a profit is that it is 
operationally integrated with Honda's Ohio plants, which have an 
annual capacity of 500,000 units. 
  As an example, of the two side panels for the two-door Civic 
coupe, the Canadian plant produces the right panel, while the 
left panel is made in the United States and the two plants 
interchange those two parts. This approach is used to avoid the 
duplication of metal molds between the two plants. 
  The Canadian plant is not staffed with a purchasing 
department for parts and materials. Indirect costs were reduced 
by placing responsibility at the U.S. plant for quality 
assurance and price negotiations for parts. Mr. Kawai says, "The 
U.S. plants operate three assembly lines and we operate the 
Canadian plant as if it were the fourth assembly line." 
  Recently, additional efforts have been exerted towards 
increasing the locally procured parts and material content of 
Honda vehicles. The cars currently produced at the Canadian 
plant carry North American parts in excess of the 50 percent 
prescribed by NAFTA. Retention of NAFTA benefits will require 
that that percentage be increased to 62.5 percent by the year 
2000. However, Mr. Kawai has indicated a higher target, saying, 
"Our goal is 67.5 percent." 
  The Canadian plant has been affected by a U.S. Government 
proposal dating back to 1992 for a tariff surcharge. The U.S. 
Customs Bureau charged that Canadian-made Hondas did not contain 
locally procured parts and materials at the 50-percent level 
required for duty-free export to the United States and had asked 
Honda to make a huge payment in the form of a tariff surcharge. 
Honda reacted strongly, saying, "The action was politically 
motivated," and won recognition of its position at the very end, 
but it also was made keenly aware of the fact that the local 
content percentage could change significantly based on political 
trends. Honda's goal set at 5 percent above the official goal is 
inspired by the desire to avoid future friction. 
  However, no matter how much Honda raises its local content 
goal and no matter how much it expands exports to areas other 
than North America, any deterioration in the performance of the 
U.S. Big Three automakers could lead to friction. 
Notwithstanding, Honda has no choice but to advance its 
localization efforts. Ford Motor, which entered the European 
market, dedicated itself to the effort for over 60 years before 
it won recognition as a member of local industry. It has been 
only seven years since Honda opened its plant in Canada. It 
still has much work ahead in its localization efforts.

  [Text] The government will ask China to abolish its import 
regulations in connection with a working group meeting on GATT 
membership which is scheduled to be held in Geneva on 27 June. 
Japan has already submitted a list of items to China on which it 
has requested tariffs should be lowered. It will also start 
full- fledged negotiations in the non-tariff field. 
  China has adopted an import quota system for wide-ranging 
products, including automobiles, home electrical appliances, and 
textile goods. In bilateral negotiations which are to be held 
to coincide with the working group meeting, Japan will urge 
China to abolish this system, saying it is questionable under 
GATT rules. Regarding non-tariff barriers, the government will 
call for market opening in such fields as the trading business 
in which Japan is very interested. Japan submitted a 3,300-item 
list to China in March requesting tariff cuts, and received a 
reply in May. However, since the reply was insufficient, Japan 
intends to ask to China to take further measures to lower 
tariffs by submitting the additional 300-item list.

<F P=106> [By Makoto Suzuki] </F>
  [Text] Hanoi, 25 June -- A decision was made to build 
Hanoi International Airport, which will be the main gateway to 
Vietnam, by using aid from Japan. Following the rapid economic 
growth and promotion of an open-door policy, the number of 
travelers and amount of cargo arriving in Hanoi suddenly 
increased. The situation is such that the current international 
airport cannot cope with this rapid growth in the long-run. As 
a top priority, the Vietnamese Government had asked Japan for 
aid. The Japanese Government, which started to grant project 
loans to Vietnam in fiscal 1993, decided to promote airport 
construction as a sales point for its yen-based loans. The 
total construction cost of the airport is several hundred 
million dollars and it is expected to be completed around 2000. 
  The new international airport will be constructed in an area 
south of and adjacent to Noibai Airport [name as published], 
which is about 20 km south of Hanoi. Currently, the Noibai 
Airport is used as both an international and a domestic airport. 
However, there is only one runway and the airport facilities 
are old. On the other hand, the number of passengers of 
international airlines which fly to Hanoi will be three times as 
many as that of 1993 and the quantity of cargo will be 
quadrupled by 2000. 
  The Vietnamese Government, which strongly hopes for 
realization of the new airport project, asked a Japanese 
Government delegation which visited Vietnam late this month for 
aid. The Japanese delegation promised its cooperation and told 
the Vietnamese Government that it would carry out a feasibility 
study, which is a precondition for yen-based loans, from this 
year to next year. On the basis of this outcome, the new 
airport construction will be included in a list of next year's 
yen-based loans as a new project. 
  According to a plan of the Vietnamese Government, the new 
international airport will be constructed in a 490-hector area 
of land and a 3,200-meter runway, terminal buildings, aprons, 
and other facilities will be constructed there. The Noibai 
Airport will be used as a domestic airport when the new airport 
is constructed. It is expected that construction of the new 
airport will be completed around 2000. 
  International financial organizations from countries around 
the world started last year to provide full-fledged aid to 
Vietnam. The amount of aid from Japan, which resumed 
full-fledged aid to Vietnam in 1992, is far larger than that of 
other countries. However, the yen-based loans have been used 
for certain projects, such as the construction of 
power-generating stations, which are not well-known to the 
general public. Therefore, it is true that not many people in 
Vietnam know about aid from Japan. The construction of the new 
international airport in the capital city is a well-known 
project. It will have an effect of publicizing Japan's 
contributions.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Study of Sanwa Research Institute </F>
Shows Increased Domestic Demand More Effective To Reduce 
Surplus, Not Strong Yen"] 
  [Text] On 31 May [1994], Sanwa Research Institute completed 
an estimate which indicates a gradually rising yen and expanded 
domestic demand would still result in an increase in a trade 
surplus with the United States. However, the institute indicates 
if domestic demand rises significantly, the surplus should drop 
and that there is a need to take actions to provide for greater 
increases in domestic demand and market-opening measures to 
include deregulation in order to avoid a worsening in Japan-U.S. 
friction. 
  The estimate assumed that the yen would stay in the $1 = 105 
yen range or gradually rise to $1 = 95 yen by 1998 while 
domestic demand would rise to 2 percent or 4 percent. 
  The estimate indicates a trade surplus with the United 
States 
of $71.6 billion assuming a foreign currency rate of $1 = 95 yen 
and a 4 percent growth in domestic demand, substantially above 
the fiscal year 1993 surplus with the United States of $50.2 
billion. If the value of the yen remains around $1 = 105 yen and 
domestic demand grows 2 percent, the trade surplus would be 
$80.2 billion. 
  On the other hand, assuming a 4 percent growth in domestic 
demand and exchange rates at either 105 yen or 95 yen, the 
overall trade surplus in 1998 would fall below the $120.2 
billion surplus of 1993. In the event domestic demand is 2 
percent, the surplus will be substantially higher. Of special 
note is that the surplus will grow at a significantly higher 
rate if the yen rises in value, whether economic growth rate is 
low or high. The research institute concludes that an expansion 
in domestic demand is more effective than adjustments in foreign 
exchange rates in reducing trade surpluses because structural 
conditions exist in which it is difficult to reduce exports even 
if dollar-denominated prices rise because of a strong yen.

<F P=106> [Article by Hideki Takabayashi: "Extraordinary Event in </F>
Industry Cooperation--`Desperate Battle' of Auto Industry, Which 
Presses Moribund Blast-Furnace Companies To Cut Prices"] 
  [Text] The steel industry has fallen into a crisis 
situation, with major blast-furnace companies facing losses and 
suspension of dividends. The auto industry, which has staked its 
survival, is leveling demands at the steel industry for price 
cuts. But behind that severity lies unexpected "understanding." 
  "The situation is that plant and equipment built for autos 
is 
not operating. Management of every steel company is suffering 
because of that depreciation burden," "We have not once received 
a guarantee from users saying `We will buy X number of vehicles 
next year'"... This kind of offense and defense is being fought 
between steel and autos. 
  Toshio Kokure, Kawasaki Steel Corporation vice president (in 
charge of operations), was astonished at being pressed by the 
president of a major auto company who said, "For vehicles which 
emphasize price, like light cars, 80 percent of the steel can be 
replaced by imported material." 
  At present, 100 percent of the steel used by the automakers 
is procured from domestic blast-furnace companies. Since the 
summer of last year, automakers have been requesting price cuts 
on steel materials, against the background of a resolve that is 
even prepared to reduce that. 
  The beginning was a revolt of companies that make auto 
parts. 
From 1992 into 1993 complaints gushed forth from parts makers: 
"Why do we have to buy expensive domestic steel despite being 
asked to lower costs by units of 1 yen and 1 sen?" No matter how 
much parts makers push ahead with lowering of processing costs 
by self-help efforts, it is very hard to make progress in 
lowering costs if material costs, which account for about 
one-half of all costs, do not become lower. 
  A system of "centralized procurement" of steel has been 
established in the auto industry. It is a system by which 
automakers also buy in one lot from steelmakers the steel used 
by parts makers, and supply it to them. For the automakers, the 
price was less by buying in one lot, and it was effective in 
controlling their keiretsu; for the steelmakers, it had the 
advantages of the number of companies to negotiate with being 
reduced and of price and volume being stable. 
  But, starting the year before last, the market price became 
less than the price of steel purchased in a centralized manner 
and supplied to parts makers. For example, in contrast to the 
fact that cold rolled steel could be purchased on the market for 
about 65,000 yen per ton, the supply price was 90,000 yen, a big 
gap. 
  The phenomenon of reversal had also occurred a number of 
times in the past, but it was temporary and soon reverted to the 
former state. The cause lay in disorder in the supply volume 
among domestic producers, so it could be solved by adjustment 
among steel companies, which are predisposed toward cooperation. 
But the cause of the current drop in the market price was 
imported steel, such as that made in South Korea. If it were a 
domestic problem, "consultation" would operate. But it does not 
happen that way when overseas entities are involved. 
  Automakers judged that "the price reversal is not a 
temporary 
phenomenon; it will continue in the future as well," so starting 
last year they began asking steelmakers to lower prices. 
  Although this matter has not yet been settled, it worked out 
that, beginning in April, auto companies lowered the price at 
which they supply steel to parts makers by 5,000-7,000 yen. 
  Steelmakers say "it is a price between automakers and parts 
makers, so it has nothing to do with a price reduction with us." 
But, actually, there is a strong possibility that the 
steelmakers' price for autos will also drop by about 5 percent. 
<H5>  Automakers' Own Device Prevents Them From Reaping the </H5>
Strong-Yen Benefit 
  Because of the strong yen since last year, automakers' 
profits have declined by a total of about 1 trillion yen. 
Therefore, they accelerated cost reduction, but they became 
irritated by the fact that it is very difficult to restore 
material that gains the strong-yen benefit. Steel is a typical 
example of that. 
  However, the automakers' production system itself had 
factors 
which hinder reaping the strong-yen dividend. Japanese 
manufacturers have adopted the just-in-time (JIT) production 
system. Deliveries must be made a number of times each day at 
established times. It is arranged that the storage and delivery 
for that purpose are the role of the steelmakers. Even if the 
auto companies tried to use imported steel, it would be 
impossible in the present situation, in which there are no 
overseas blast-furnace companies which employ a delivery system 
which conforms to JIT. 
  Automakers also recognize this situation, so the question of 
how much extra cost there is because of conforming to JIT has 
become an issue in the negotiations on lowering of costs. 
  One more thing which stands in the way of imported steel is 
the question of quality. Japanese cars use a lot of high-grade, 
expensive steel, such as corrosion-resistant steel plate, which 
does not rust easily; high-tensile steel plate, which is strong 
and thin; and steel that can withstand complicated pressing. 
Japanese blast-furnace companies have responded to automakers' 
severe demands by this technology. One could not use imported 
material for that kind of high-performance steel, even if one so 
desired. 
  But the highest performance steel that is used in autos 
accounts for about 40 percent. Aside from that, one can use 
imported steel if one so wishes. Furthermore, in promoting the 
inexpensive building of cars, automakers are trying to lower the 
proportion of expensive steel that is used. 
  Japanese automakers bought Chrysler Neons, which appeared on 
the market at a miraculously low price, and inspected them 
thoroughly to find out why they can be made cheaply. Among other 
things, they were also deeply impressed by the way of using 
steel. Japanese cars have to use expensive steel because of 
complicated surface design. In contrast to that, by making 
curved surfaces gentle, so that they are easy to press, it has 
been arranged that inexpensive grades of steel plate can be used 
on the Neon. 
  At present Japanese automakers are competing fiercely in how 
to make cars inexpensively. Therefore, means are being devised 
by which even inexpensive steel will serve the purpose. If that 
happens, it will mean that preparations will have been made for 
being able to use imported material, or electric steel, which is 
not used now because of unstable quality. 
<H5>  Cooperation Crumbles Before Survival </H5>
  Automakers are indebted to steelmakers for more than 
development of technology. In order to increase the ratio of 
local procurement for cars produced in the United States, they 
replaced the steel which had been exported from Japan, with 
products of U.S. blast-furnace companies that received 
technology from Japanese blast-furnace companies. The drastic 
reduction in steel exports is due in part to a ruling on 
dumping, but it is said that "even if it had been an acquittal, 
the reduction in exports would have been delayed by only one to 
two years" (major auto company). 
  Moreover, the fact that parts makers extricated themselves 
from centralized procurement because they were unable to endure 
the price difference means that the amount purchased decreased, 
so automakers' power to negotiate with steelmakers became 
weaker. Because of these reasons, although the auto industry 
pressed for price reductions, the pressure to lower prices is 
weaker than that from such large-demand users as shipbuilding 
and electrical appliances, which opened the door to imported 
steel. 
  There is an understanding that 1) the lowering of prices 
until they correspond to the international price will be done in 
stages for the next three years, when restructuring of the steel 
industry will progress; 2) the rate by which prices will be 
lowered will be greater for low-grade steel and less for high 
value-added steel, for which the cost of developing technology 
has not been recovered; and 3) models up to the year 2000, when 
depreciation of production plant and equipment will end, will 
not cause rapid reduction in the use of high value-added steel. 
  Perhaps that is why an impression such as "I thought that in 
negotiations on price cuts the auto industry deals with things 
more reasonably than shipbuilding and so on, which seek drastic 
price cuts" (Kawasaki Steel Corporation vice president Kokure) 
leaked from the steel side. 
  The one exhibiting this kind of action which most 
understands 
the steel side is Toyota Motor Corporation, which is famous for 
severity in lowering costs. 
  Behind this transformation lies the installation of Toyota's 
chairman, Shoichiro Toyoda, as chairman of Keidanren (end of 
May). One can easily imagine that it avoided a clash with the 
steel industry, which up to now, as the representative of 
industry, has produced any number of Keidanren chairmen. But to 
judge this phenomenon as Toyota having come of age is too great 
a leap of logic without going into the essence. It is being 
demanded that Japanese business reform, from its closed nature 
within Japan to internationalization, and from the cooperation 
of collusion to rational competition. Can we not say that to 
have chosen, in spite of that, to maintain a system of industry 
cooperation and a doctrine of giving preference to the domestic 
scene, is a compromise which sees only what is under its nose? 
  The price and system determined by negotiation between the 
champions, Toyota and Nippon Steel Corporation, will probably 
have a strong effect on both industries, just as up till now. 
But that does not mean that the shakiness toward steel of lower 
ranking automakers, whose operation is suffering, will have 
ended. "From our standpoint, even the price cut that is soon to 
be decided on will still not be low enough. It is also possible 
that we will get imported material in the future. We have no 
leeway to be considerate just because steel is having a hard 
time" (Mitsubishi Motor Corporation executive director Shigeru 
Nakagawa, who is also director of the Purchasing Division). 
  A person in charge of purchasing for an automaker says "We 
are working with the feeling that the (currently existing) 11 
automakers may not all survive. Unless we get the blast-furnace 
companies to also think that the present six companies will not 
necessarily all survive...." 
  Even if the two top companies, Toyota and Nippon Steel, try 
to preserve the current setup, there is no doubt that it will 
gradually crumble in the face of free competition.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hitotsubashi University Professor Yukio </F>
Noguchi by unidentified reporter; place and date not given: 
"Loan Shark Who Lives in Shack"] 
  [Text] There are signs that the Japanese economy is finally 
making a recovery from the collapse of the bubble, but it has no 
time to take a breather. The reason is that Japan is faced with 
a bevy of crucial future issues such as welfare and attendant 
fiscal burden based on the imminent arrival of an aged society, 
industrial infrastructure and international relations. We asked 
experts how they would portray visions of the Japanese economy. 
  [Boxed item: "Basic Public Works Investment 
Program." The Social Infrastructure Construction Program 
was approved by the government in June 1990 in response to 
requests from the United States for expansion of domestic demand 
during the Japan-U.S. Structural Impediments Initiative talks. 
The program called for public works investments totaling about 
430 trillion yen during a 10-year period beginning in fiscal 
year 1991 and ending in fiscal year 2000. The report released in 
December 1993 by the prime minister's private advisory organ 
known as Economic Reform Research Council and the outline of 
external economic reforms issued by the government in March of 
this year indicate that a final decision will be made in June, 
including provision for funding. Sources suggest that the 
government will ask the private sector to augment government 
programs by a total of 100 trillion yen.] 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] I see that you described Japan as "a loan 
shark that lives in a shack" in your book, An Outline for 
Reform of the Japanese Economy. 
  [Noguchi] The reason why the Japanese current trade surplus 
is so huge is that there is an absence of domestic investments 
which offset the high savings rate. The difference between 
savings and domestic investments represents the surplus in the 
recurring balance of payments and, while that difference is 
invested overseas, Japan's social infrastructure remains 
impoverished. In other words, Japan lives in a shack while it 
practices its role as a loan shark. We should alter this 
situation by rechanneling overseas investments to Japan and 
improving our living conditions. The end result of such action 
will be a reduction in the surplus in balance of payments. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What actions should we take in specific 
terms? 
  [Noguchi] In Japan, social infrastructure affecting living 
conditions such as sewage, road and park systems, and commuter 
railways still exist in a meager state. We should improve those 
systems while savings rates are still high. If we wait until the 
arrival of the aged society and when savings rates have fallen, 
it will be too late. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Wouldn't it be adequate to stimulate 
private-sector investment through deregulation, without relying 
on public works spending? 
  [Noguchi] Your suggested approach would be adequate if we 
were speaking of merely reducing balance of payments surpluses 
by equalizing savings and investments, but our ultimate goal 
should be an improvement in our living standards. Attainment of 
that goal will require a revision of the basic public works 
program and a bold expansion of public works investment. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The Economic Reform Council's report 
stipulates as a prerequisite of improvement in social capital, 
"the provision of funding which will not leave a legacy of debt 
for future generations." 
  [Noguchi] Logic says that if you use government bonds to 
fund 
public works projects, you will leave a legacy of debt for 
future generations. However, if restrictions relative thereto 
are imposed, a huge tax increase will be required and it will 
become impossible to implement that which is required. It is the 
obligation of our generation to build a quality social 
infrastructure and leave it as a legacy for future generations. 
It would be acceptable to issue government bonds for that 
purpose. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] However, wouldn't that result in leaving 
unpaid bills for payment by future generations? 
  [Noguchi] Many people think that government bonds, like 
household debt, leave the need to repay debt at a future date, 
but this is a major misunderstanding. Government bonds represent 
a household debt like the husband borrowing from the wife and 
differs in substance from a situation in which a household 
borrows from outside sources. The redemption of government bonds 
provides for repayment of debt to a nation's citizens. Thus, 
government bonds do not represent a legacy of debt for the 
nation as a whole. Redemption of government bonds will have to 
be handled through modest future tax increases, but such 
measures would be appropriate from the standpoint of equitable 
distribution of fiscal burdens. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The Ministry of Finance has stated that it 
already faces a financial crisis in the current situation 
wherein the government bond balance has exceeded 200 trillion 
yen. 
  [Noguchi] The ratio of government bond balances outstanding 
rose sharply against the gross national product (GNP) from the 
1970's to the 1980's. I believe the risk of financial failure 
existed during those years. However, since the 1980's, the ratio 
of the balances against GNP has fallen. Accordingly, fiscal 
deficits are not a very serious problem. It is only logical that 
fiscal authorities concern themselves about expansion of 
deficits, but the problem lies in converting such concerns 
directly into government policy. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The viewpoint exists that Japan's 
balance-of-payments surplus is a valuable resource. 
  [Noguchi] Since we exist in a situation where insufficient 
savings is a worldwide problem, Japan's surpluses play an 
unmistakable role in international society. Thus, if Japan were 
to reduce its surpluses as well as overseas investments, the 
money supply and demand situation would tighten and interests 
rates would rise in foreign nations. However, notwithstanding 
the potential for such a situation, there is a need to reduce 
balance-of-payments surpluses to take enhancement measures 
relative to our living standards. I believe that "reduction of 
balance of payments surpluses for the sake of international 
coordination" represents a conceptual misinterpretation of 
substantive issues.

<F P=106> [Interview with Senshu University Professor Kimihiro </F>
Masamura by unidentified reporter; place and date not given: 
"Misfortunes of Tight Funding of Welfare Programs"] 
  [Text] [Boxed item: "21st Century Welfare Vision 
Program." This was the title of the report published by 
Minister of Health and Welfare Keigo Ouchi's private advisory 
organ in March. The objective of the report was to propose ways 
to enhance social welfare standards, primarily in the area of 
nursing and childcare. If among the four proposed estimates, the 
one titled "Improvement of Nursing and Enhancement of Efficiency 
of Annuities and Medicine" is selected, the ratio of the social 
security burden representing the costs of annuity premiums and 
medical insurance premiums paid as a percentage of personal 
incomes will rise from an estimated 17.8 percent in fiscal year 
1993 to about 30 percent in fiscal year 2025. If taxation for 
other than social security remains unchanged, the combined tax 
burden on individuals will reach 51 percent.] 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The 21st century welfare vision program, 
which encompasses improvement in the levels of social welfare in 
the areas of nursing for the elderly and childcare, serves as a 
basis for justifying hikes in the consumption tax. Are you 
satisfied with the vision spoken of in this case? 
  [Masamura] I approve of the welfare vision program's 
proposal 
to change the allocation of social welfare funding for annuity, 
medical, and welfare programs from 50-40-10 to 50-30-20. Japan 
lags drastically in its handling of welfare programs. Finally, 
after implementation of the consumption tax, a Gold Plan (a 
10-year strategy to promote the health and welfare of senior 
citizens) was compiled, but the welfare vision program proposes 
a bold enhancement of those objectives. Doing so is only 
logical, but the measures proposed are still wholly inadequate. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] In what ways is the vision inadequate? 
  The welfare vision program does not provide specific 
personnel and facility numbers, but provides for "a minimum of 
some kind of in-home service once daily." That level of service 
will require a family member to dedicate himself to the care of 
the elderly person in question and would make it impossible for 
the elderly person to live by himself with a sense a security. I 
feel that providing nursing care on a fully delegated basis will 
require increasing the number of home helpers provided for in 
the Gold Plan for the end of fiscal year 1999 from 100,000 to 
500,000. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] However, wouldn't that mean a huge fiscal 
burden? 
  [Masamura] Using the 500,000 figure, assuming personnel 
costs 
of 10 million yen per home helper per year, the total cost would 
come to 1 percent of GNP. The question is whether that figure is 
high. Shortchanging a program and making its outlook uncertain 
would be most unfortunate. Moreover if we would increase the 
number of home helpers and case workers, employment 
opportunities would increase near the homes of such specialists. 
Such job opportunities will enhance options for women at a time 
when a lower birth rate is at issue. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Is it inevitable that the taxpayers' burden 
for taxes and social security premiums will rise as a percentage 
of personal income? 
  [Masamura] The Provisional Council for the Promotion of 
Administrative Reform and Provisional Administrative Research 
Council have consistently stressed that the government will take 
action to ensure that the public's burden will not rise above 50 
percent (compared to an estimate of 38.6 percent for fiscal year 
1993), but there is no basis for such projections. In the past, 
Sweden and the former West Germany attained high economic growth 
rates despite a high level of welfare services coupled with high 
taxation. They were able to establish welfare programs of a 
high, stable standard, but taxation rates totaling 60 percent 
were inevitable. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Don't you see a potential for uncontrolled 
increases in the tax burden? 
  [Masamura] There is a need to compile an economic reform 
package which includes cost reductions based on administrative 
and fiscal reform. The welfare vision program provides estimates 
of the benefits and costs of social security programs through 
fiscal year 2025, but it should include an estimate of total 
government spending. Previously, the public was unable to grasp 
the total picture of how their lives related to government 
activities, but that has begun to change. It is government's 
responsibility to provide that picture and to maintain a 
dialogue with the public. To speak of a future vision without 
revealing the costs is demagoguery. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Does this mean specifically that we have no 
choice but to raise the consumption tax rate? 
  [Masamura] Yes. And the issue is not limited to that single 
action. We need to deal with the question of just what is fair 
taxation and deal with an across-the-board tax system reform for 
the first time since the postwar Sharp recommendations on tax 
reform. Direct taxes are subject to a variety of exemptions and 
special provisions and are obscure and confusing. It is said 
that the consumption tax is retrogressive and relatively more 
burdensome for low-income families, but if inheritance taxes and 
taxation of savings are properly administered, they need not be 
retrogressive. The overall debate must also include social 
security taxes. There is not enough time to arrive at 
conclusions before the year end. Tax reductions and provisions 
for additional revenues for the next year should be based on 
temporary revisions, and a working committee composed of 
specialists other than the government Tax Council should be 
organized to conduct a study within a specified time frame.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tokyo University Professor Hiroshi Miyajima </F>
by unidentified reporter; place and date not given: "Tax System 
That Revitalizes Local Areas"] 
  [Text] [Boxed item: "Concept for Local Consumption 
Tax." The current consumption tax is collected by the 
central government as a national tax and is allocated to local 
governments at the rate of 20 percent of taxes collected as a 
consumption transfer tax and at the rate of 19.2 percent of 
taxes collected as a local government grant. In contrast, in 
connection with the contemplated increase in the consumption tax 
rate, the local consumption tax concept calls for direct 
collection of a portion of the consumption tax by prefectural 
governments for use as a fiscal source belonging to the local 
government. Such a change is being proposed by local governments 
and the Ministry of Home Affairs in view of the expected future 
increase in the welfare burden of local governments. The 
government's Tax Council has established a working committee to 
study the proposal as a major issue in connection with pending 
tax system reforms.] 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] It is said that the new cabinet's foremost 
issue is tax system reform. What sort of reform do you see as 
being necessary? 
  [Miyajima] As suggested in the 21st century welfare vision 
program, a senior citizen society will mean an inevitable rise 
in the public burden whether it be taxes or social security 
premiums. However, the current tax system is designed to impose 
the burden on members of the active work force. A major issue 
consists of changing this policy. About 15 percent of those 
individuals whose incomes exceed 20 million yen are senior 
citizens above age 60. On the other hand, individuals who rely 
solely on government annuities for their livelihood lead 
difficult lifestyles. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What should we do to cope with such 
discrepancies? 
  [Miyajima] We should implement a comprehensive tax system 
that taxes both interest income and annuity income. After 
adopting a comprehensive tax system, the highest income tax 
bracket, which is currently 50 percent, should be lowered to 
about 30 percent. Interest can be taxed at the source at the 
highest income tax rate and subsequently refunded to those in 
lower income tax or tax-exempt brackets. The comprehensive tax 
system should be designed so as to impose a tax burden on those 
who are fortunate, whether they are in the senior citizen 
bracket or in the working class, and to exempt the less 
fortunate from the tax burden. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the consumption tax 
where debate centers on a hike? 
  [Miyajima] If one looks at European nations, income taxes 
and 
consumption taxes will be the two main sources of revenues in 
21st century Japan, and I believe the future will call for 
increases in the consumption tax. The question is, what policy 
areas should be covered by the increased revenues? Under the 
government's welfare tax concept, even if the tax rate is set at 
7 percent, revenue therefrom will have to be used to offset 
other tax reductions, and only 800 billion yen will be available 
for use on welfare programs. Such figures will not be acceptable 
to the public. Before hiking taxes, we must clearly establish 
programs so that the public will reap the benefits of taxation 
in the form of improved welfare programs and improvements in 
social capital. Further, unless we completely correct the 
problem of "benefits of employee income tax withholdings" on the 
part of employers, we will not be able to maintain any semblance 
of social fairness. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The emasculation of industry is about to 
become an issue, but what should we do about corporate taxes? 
  [Miyajima] It is said that Japan is heavily dependent on 
direct taxation, but a major basis for that viewpoint is the 
high ratio of corporate taxes. Of special note is that 
dependence on the corporate operating tax, which is the local 
government-imposed version of corporate taxes, is unusually high 
on an internationally comparative basis. The world as a whole is 
moving towards lower corporate taxes. If Japan alone retains 
high tax rates, manufacturers will have no choice but to 
transfer factories overseas, considering the additional 
disadvantage of a strong yen. Maintaining economic vitality 
calls for lowering of corporate taxes. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] If the corporate operating tax is reduced, 
local governments will face increasing shortfalls in their tax 
revenues. 
  [Miyajima] We can raise the consumption tax and allocate the 
additional revenue to the local governments. They can be used to 
cover local government expenses such as welfare and improvement 
of the living environment. Certainly, local government requires 
stable revenue sources. We have no alternative but to 
decentralize government authority and to use taxes to improve 
living standards as a means to justify the need for raising the 
consumption tax. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What you are addressing is the introduction 
of the local consumption tax as debated by the government's Tax 
Council, is it not? 
  [Miyajima] The tax system recommended by Sharp that served 
as 
the basis for postwar tax system reform treated the corporate 
operations tax as a kind of value-added tax such as the 
consumption tax. A local consumption tax will translate into the 
restoration of some of those original tax ideas. The local 
consumption tax could result in cases where the locale of 
consumption and the locale of tax payment will vary, but the 
Ministry of Finance needs to deal with the issue of how to 
allocate taxes as part of government decentralization programs. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] A single-year income tax reduction was 
implemented as an economic stimulus measure, while social 
security premiums were increased, bringing criticism from the 
United States that "we lost the benefits of a tax reduction." 
  [Miyajima] Although for the public both areas represent 
publicly sustained expense items, taxes are handled by the 
Ministry of Finance, and social security insurance premiums are 
handled by the Ministry of Health and Welfare with an absence of 
policy coordination. Taxes and social security premiums should 
be debated jointly. In the United States and Britain, social 
security taxes are collected by the tax authorities, and the 
same should be done in Japan. Duplicate collecting systems are 
also a waste of government resources.

<F P=106> [Interview with economic critic Katsuto Uchihashi by </F>
unidentified reporter; place and date not given: "Rough Road to 
an Affluent Nation"] 
  [Text] [Boxed item: "Five-Year Program for an 
Affluent Nation." This program was approved by the Miyazawa 
cabinet in June 1992 on the basis of a report submitted by the 
Economic Council. The program provided for the major objective 
of diverting emphasis from a corporate society that stressed 
efficiency to a society that emphasized the perspective of 
individuals and consumers, and it suggested the basic direction 
for management of the economy until fiscal year 1996 calling for 
improvement of the living environment and shortening of work 
hours. Specific goals included land measures to enable the 
purchase of quality homes in urban areas at a cost of five times 
the average annual salary and shortening annual work hours to 
1,800. An increase in cost burden of the program goals to be 
imposed on the public was considered inevitable, but was to be 
minimized to the degree possible.] 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] I see that in your book Failure or 
Recovery--Urgent Proposals for the Japanese Economy, you 
assert that an affluent nation is not feasible as an extension 
of a Japanese-style economic giant. 
  [Uchihashi] I believe that we were able to become an 
economic 
giant because we chose a method that kept us from becoming an 
affluent nation. We cannot hope to become an affluent nation 
just because we succeeded in becoming an economic giant. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Just what are you trying to say? 
  In postwar Japan, ultra-low-interest policies were used to 
provide industry with low-cost funds through financial 
institutions. As a result, industry was able to build production 
facilities which were adequate in terms of international 
competition. "Operations using the buying power of underlying 
assets" in the form of the collateral value of differences 
between book value and market price was also encouraged. On the 
other hand, low-interest rates on savings and soaring land 
prices obstructed household efforts to accumulate wealth and 
families were forced to buy goods at prices that exceeded export 
prices. Unless we take measures to alter this transfer of income 
from households to industry, goals such as emphasis on the 
individual and consumer as stated in the Five-Year Program for 
an Affluent Nation will merely serve as catchphrases. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] On the other hand, I hear that erstwhile 
growth policies have reached their limits. 
  [Uchihashi] It has come to the point where the Japanese 
economic specialty of pursuing the effects of mass production is 
no longer effective. Specifically, automobile, electronic 
equipment, and machine tool manufacturers would compete in the 
world market by increasing production and attaining growth 
through reducing manufacturing costs on a unit basis. However, 
the makers now face a situation in which the costs of pursuing 
the effects of mass production now exceed the benefits of such 
mass production. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Why is it that they have reached such a 
limit? 
  [Uchihashi] Continuing pursuit of the benefits of mass 
production requires a massive consumption market, but the 
domestic market has ceased to grow. The U.S. market had served 
as a bottomless consumer of the difference in Japanese domestic 
supply and demand, but the United States under the Clinton 
administration nows says that they do not welcome such an 
approach. On the other hand, the marketing approach of 
generating replacement buying through design changes on a short 
four-year cycle is no longer effective. In addition to the 
inability to borrow based on undeclared book value which has 
made fund procurement more difficult, the cost of capital 
expansion has also skyrocketed. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the switch to 
dependency 
on the Asian market? 
  [Uchihashi] Considering the present situation in which 
dependence on the U.S. markets has hit a brick wall and direct 
investments in Asia have increased sharply in response to the 
strong yen, the industrial world hinges its future on the 
formation of a yen-based Asian economic sphere. However, I feel 
any attempt of that nature will not succeed. East Asia already 
comes under the U.S. sphere of influence and is a member of the 
dollar-based economic sphere. Excessive export-dependence-style 
growth structures are also unsustainable. In the future, we need 
to establish strong consumer markets in Japan. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What sort of ideas do you have in that 
respect? 
  [Uchihashi] We need to build social capital systems that 
rest 
on concepts that minimize social costs, such as those arising 
from commuter congestion and traffic accidents, by providing 
roadways that permit the coexistence of people and vehicles such 
as those in Europe which are partitioned into two-level, triple 
conduits providing for movement of people, bicycles and 
motorcycles, and motor vehicles. I am speaking of building a new 
infrastructure that gives priority to conditions conducive to 
providing for comfortable lifestyles and attendant expansion in 
domestic demand. Further, as is the case with the German 
Workers' Property Formation System, the program should provide 
for construction of urban environments and aggressive government 
promotion of preferential fiscal and tax treatment for formation 
of individual assets such as privately owned homes, thus 
contributing to the building of a strong consumer society. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] It appears that you also foresee a change in 
the environment for businesses. 
  [Uchihashi] Strong competitors for businesses such as 
consumer cooperatives have arrived on the scene. People have 
come to realize that businesses are not the only providers of 
goods and services. I also think that, as the unemployment rate 
climbs, we will see the formation of workers cooperatives which 
will allow workers themselves to take the initiative in finding 
new employment. Government assistance to be extended to such 
organizations will also mostly likely become policy issues.

"Liberalism Is the Main Direction of the World"] 
  [Text] [Boxed item: "Deregulation." In its 
interim report of 8 November 1993, former Prime Minister 
Hosokawa's private advisory organ, the Economic Reform Research 
Council, headed by Keidanren President Gaishi Hiraiwa stressed 
in principle deregulation of economic controls and proposed 
measures such as simplification of standards certifications and 
inspections that pose barriers for entry into Japan's markets, 
promotion of competition in the financial sector, and relaxation 
of controls on land and housing. In its final report of 16 
December, the council stressed the "reform of the former 
export-oriented economic structure into a 
domestic-demand-oriented economic structure by relaxing 
regulations, restructuring businesses, investing in housing and 
social capital, and shrinking differentials between domestic and 
international prices."] 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] I see that your recent book, 
Political-Economic Academics of the Heisei Recession, 
predicts that the 1990's will become the age of liberalism. 
  [Sawa] In his book The Cycles of American History, 
published in 1986, U.S. historian Arthur Schlesinger predicted 
that the 1990's would become the age of liberalism providing for 
tolerance for the socially weak. In the 1992 presidential 
elections, liberal Clinton won and Schlesinger's prediction 
proved to be accurate. I believe liberalism is currently a 
worldwide trend. The worldwide recession has caused people to 
reaffirm the role of government. Moreover, since socialism has 
collapsed, even if one advocates a managed form of capitalism, 
he need not be concerned about being called a socialist 
sympathizer. Even in Japan, the collapse of the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] government will force an option between 
conservative and liberal approaches. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Individuals who professed "liberalism" have 
withdrawn from the coalition government. 
  [Sawa] We can recognize the Hosokawa government for its 
accomplishments in the area of political reform. However, the 
government that was united on the basis of political and 
anti-LDP principles failed miserably in the area of economic 
reform. A split developed between conservatives of Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito, who attempted to push a 
national welfare tax, and liberals of the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake [Harbinger, who opposed the 
law. It was only logical that the liberals followed with a 
withdrawal from the coalition. The Hata government led by 
Shinseito will probably embark on the new conservative reforms 
advocated in Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa's book, 
Blueprint for Building a New Japan. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What sort of principle are we speaking of in 
the area of economic policy when we refer to new conservative 
principles? 
  [Sawa] New conservatism is based on the idea that government 
intervention in the marketplace is inimical. It also holds that 
public services should benefit only those who are not 
economically fortunate and it cannot accept the principle that 
only those who are wealthy must shoulder those costs. As an 
example, in the area of tax systems, conservatives think that 
income taxes which are incrementally higher for higher income 
levels should be abolished. Thus, conservatives try to 
simultaneously reduce income taxes while hiking indirect taxes. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What are your thoughts on liberal economic 
policies? 
  [Sawa] Liberals think that markets are imperfect and that 
markets alone cannot correct imbalances such as unemployment; 
they emphasize government roles, such as creation of employment 
opportunities and income redistribution. They stress basic 
welfare policies that call for high welfare spending as well as 
high welfare costs. However, in the area of taxes, they respect 
progressive income taxes as a way of correcting inequities in 
income distribution and oppose income tax cuts that give 
preferential treatment to the wealthy and simultaneous hikes in 
indirect taxes. However, liberals once failed in the creation of 
"big government" and will probably aim for a "wise government" 
on the basis of lessons learned from the difficult experiences 
of the past. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Do conservative and liberal approaches to 
deregulation differ? 
  [Sawa] Conservatives think that highest priority should be 
given to deregulation to create a free and transparent market. 
On the other hand, liberals assert that unfair controls that 
shackle competition should be abolished, but that normally, 
deregulation should be implemented in good economic times and 
that deregulation in recession can worsen unemployment. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What sort of industrial policies do you 
envision from the liberals? 
  [Sawa] Liberals, who place more importance on employment 
issues than do conservatives, will probably seek government 
participation in the development and reinforcement of high-tech 
industries and establishment of infrastructure for an 
internationally competitive industry dealing in services, 
information, and software. They will also promote 
decentralization of government as being effective in stimulating 
domestic demand and creating employment. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What sort of ideas can you think of in terms 
of new economic international contributions from the standpoint 
of a liberal? 
  [Sawa] International contributions in the area of global 
environmental preservation would be desirable. As an example, 
collection of environment taxes at a low rate based on carbon 
dioxide emissions could provide tax revenue to be used in energy 
conservation investments, subsidies for purchase of insulation 
for privately owned homes, and government assistance to 
developing nations in the form of ODA [official development 
assistance] in the area of environment. Such simultaneous 
collection of taxes and offsetting spending programs should 
minimize fears of obstructing economic growth.

  [Text] The National Space Development Agency [NASDA] 
compiled an estimate indicating replacing disposable rockets and 
satellites by reusable ones can reduce operating cost to about 
one- tenth. This will reduce transportation cost to a level 
similar to airplanes, and will make many new projects, such as 
lunar exploration and solar power generation satellites, 
possible. This was the first time a concrete program, including 
cost estimates, of reusable space systems has been made public 
in Japan. As the enormous cost of massive space development 
programs in the 21st century is becoming a problem, NASDA's 
estimate will certainly animate the debate on this issue. 
  This estimate is contained in a NASDA report: "A Study on 
the 
Repercussion Effect of Space Infrastructure." 
  The report recommends replacing the present transportation 
system using disposable rockets with a "new space 
infrastructure" based on the concept of repeated use. It 
proposes a "space shuttle system" going back and forth between 
the earth and outer space like airliners. 
  Under this scheme, "orbit operations spacecraft" responsible 
for maintenance work of satellites, "fuel stations," and 
"inter-orbit transport spacecraft" moving between different 
orbits will be launched in space. All these spacecraft are to 
be reusable. 
  According to the estimate, a shuttle spacecraft (development 
and operation cost estimated at $25 billion) and six inter-orbit 
transport spacecraft (development and operation cost $7.6 
billion) will be developed in 10 years from 1995, and these will 
be in service for 20 to 30 years. 
  As a result, while accumulated cost for the reusable space 
system, including development cost, will be overwhelmingly 
higher than the original disposable system at the beginning, by 
the year 2020, or the 15th year after going into service, cost 
for the two types will be almost the same, after which the 
reusable system will be more cost-efficient. 
  Compared to the annual operating cost of $7.5 billion for 
the 
current disposable system, cost for the reusable system will be 
around $2 billion, or about 25 percent. With further efforts to 
improve efficiency, it will be possible to reduce cost to 10 
percent. 
  With the new "space infrastructure," it will be possible, 
for 
instance, to extend the endurance of artificial satellites 
dramatically by replacing batteries or refuelling. Furthermore, 
since repairs will be possible on the orbit, the extremely high 
level of reliability required at present will not be necessary. 
This will make lower development and manufacturing cost possible. 
  The study foresees a project of transporting several hundred 
tons of helium 3, a nuclear fusion fuel which is abundantly 
available on the lunar surface, to the earth. While the 
transportation cost under the old disposable system makes up as 
much as one-fourth of the entire world space budget (around $70 
billion), under the reusable system, cost will be merely 
one-tenth. Therefore, the project "is possible even without 
obtaining new appropriations."

  [Text] On 22 June, the "defense policy council" (chaired 
by Asahi Breweries, Ltd. Chairman Kotorao Higuchi), which is an 
advisory body to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata responsible for 
studying a new framework for defense policies, held a meeting to 
discuss the issue of reviewing the organization of the Ground 
Self- Defense Forces [GSDF]. Members of the council shared the 
view that "a review of the current GSDF structure consisting of 
13 divisions is unavoidable." From now on, the council will 
hold further concrete discussions on reducing the number of GSDF 
personnel through a scale down of some units and a review of 
their organization. Regarding a GSDF organization review, 
participants at the meeting agreed on the following points: 1) 
Modernization and effective management of equipment will be 
considered; 2) a personnel reshuffle review is necessary from 
the viewpoint of the potential for war; 3) based on new defense 
policies, unit arrangements will be reviewed; and 4) the 
expansion of SDF reserve officers will be studied. 
  While some members proposed a GSDF personnel organization 
rehers called for a review of unit arran gements putting 
emphasis on defense of the metropolitan area and on disposition 
of units in regions which adjoin foreign nations.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, June 23. (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
secretary of the National Security Council of Mongolia J. 
Enhsaihan was on an official visit to the Russian Federation in 
June 19-23 at the invitation of his Russian colleague O.I. 
Lobov. During meetings and talks they have exchanged views on 
many aspects of Mongolian-Russian mutual relations. In view of 
J. Enhsaihan and O.I. Lobov priority importance in the 
Mongolian-Russian mutual relations should be attached to the 
issues of regional and international security, strengthening 
nuclear free status of Mongolia, economic security, struggle 
with criminality, international terrorism, illegal transit 
transportation of arms, narcotics. 
  In the near future a visit of the secretary of the National

commercial newspaper. In the new issue the majority of 
materials is devoted to problems of Mongolian-Russian economic 
relations. The newspaper publishes the interviews of the 
vice-premier C. Purebdorj, the ambassador of the Russian 
Federation to Mongolia S.S. Razov, an article by the well-known 
scientist-economist, Dr. P. Nergui devoted to Mongolian economy 
of the present day and tendencies for her development. 
  The newspaper also publishes materials about cultural life 
and information for foreign tourists. 
  On the occasion of the first issue of "NOVOSTI MONGOLII" the 
ceremony of presentation was held today at the House of Russian 
Science and Culture.

ARDIYN ERH informs that at the spring session of the State Great 
Hural (SGH) discussion of the draft law on land continues. The 
newspaper publishes a report on the theoretical-practical 
conference on the theme "External Policy of Mongolia for 1990's" 
which was held in June 20-21 at the Ministry for External 
Relations. At the openning of the conference which was organized 
by the Ministry for External Relations jointly with the 
Institute of International Relations of the Mongolian State 
National University present was the President P. Ochirbat. The

  [Text] The plunge of the U.S. dollar to a post-war low 
against the yen yesterday will not adversely affect Thailand's 
exports, a key factor driving the country's economy, Finance 
Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin said yesterday. 
  However, as the greenback dominates the basket of currencies 
used by the Exchange Equalization Fund in fixing the daily 
exchange rate, the baht has depreciated in value in line with 
the dollar, Mr. Tharin said. 
  "That will benefit the country in its trade with Japan and 
Europe although Thai trade in terms of U.S. dollars will be 
affected," he said. 
  The dollar's dive to 99.50 yen in yesterday morning's trade 
in Asian markets, coupled with political disarray in Japan, 
shook the stock market with the key Nikkei index plunging more 
than 460 points. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell more than 230 
points. 
  Although it was estimated that the Bank of Japan had spent 
more than U.S.$1 billion in frantically buying dollars to stop 
the slide, it was able to shore up the dollar only slightly to 
close at 99.93 yen. 
  In Thailand, despite a positive mood caused by the acquittal 
of major market player Song Watcharasirot on share manipulation 
charges, the SET failed to escape, the index falling more than 
37 points. 
  Mr. Tharin forecast that the baht would be stable in a short 
period. 
  The dollar's dive began last Tuesday and it dipped below 100 
yen for the first time since the end of World War Two. 
  The depreciation of the dollar against the yen stemmed from 
a 
failure by the U.S. and Japan to resolve trade deficits in 
February and the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata on Saturday. 
  The U.S. Federal Reserve and other leading central banks of 
19 countries, such as Japan, Germany and Switzerland, failed to 
take proper action to prop up the dollar until Friday, which was 
too late. 
  Investors no longer see the need to hold dollars as the U.S. 
has lost some appeal. The economies of Japan and Germany are 
recovering and interest rates in both countries are moving 
upward. For example, the Japanese economy recorded 3.9 percent 
growth in the first quarter of this year. 
  Mr. Tharin said the Exchange Equalization Fund would keep 
close watch on the foreign exchange situation and the central 
bank was maintaining sound liquidity. 
  Arun Chirachawala, Bangkok Bank's senior vice president for 
finance and marketing, said the U.S. Federal Reserve was 
expected to increase its rates to stabilize the dollar and that 
could force local rates to increase too. 
  But such a move could hamper the recovery of the U.S. 
economy 
in the long run. 
  Another option for the Fed was to do nothing and let the 
dollar fall until a balance was reached, he said. 
  The volatility of both currencies and the German mark has 
prompted investors to sell shares, driving down markets in 
several countries including the U.S., Japan, Hong Kong and 
Thailand, Mr. Arun said. 
  He insisted the declining dollar and other external factors, 
not the acquittal of Sia [tycoon] Song, were responsible for the 
marked drop in the Thai market. 
  "The exchange rate of the dollar, yen, and mark may tend to 
fluctuate further. The dollar has reached an alarming level of 
1.57 marks and 99.5 yen and is likely to run downhill steadily 
as long as no intervention is applied," Mr. Arun said. 
  "If the Fed raises its rates, Thai rates might rise 
unavoidably. Deposits are expanding at a much slower pace than 
credit and tend to cluster in certain banks instead of averaging 
throughout the financial system. 
  "During the latter half of this year, interest rates might 
rise but at a slower and less dramatic rate than experienced in 
the first half," he said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Burma Should Attend Meeting -- With Conditions"] </F>
  [Text] It's a fait accompli. Like it or not, the 
Government has made up its mind, perhaps a long time ago, to 
invite Burma's State Law and Order Restoration Council 
representatives to next month's ASEAN Summit in Bangkok. 
  The invitation stands. The Government says it can't imagine 
what the fuss is about -- Thailand's human rights groups and the 
international community in general voicing their opposition to 
the presence of an illegitimate government, notorious for its 
blatant human rights abuses, at the prestigious annual regional 
gathering. After all, says an Interior Ministry official: 
"Slorc's participation (at the ASEAN meeting) is only 
ceremonial." 
  But not everyone agrees. A panellist at a recent discussion 
held by a group of human rights activists at Chulalongkon 
University said: "The policy (constructive engagement) of 
neighbouring countries, particularly Thailand, has partly 
enabled the continuity of human rights abuses in Burma. " 
  Another said: "Human rights violations are a serious crime 
since all mankind is created equally. We respect the rights of 
Thai people, and we must respect those of Burmese." 
  They know what they are talking about. The latest rumblings 
heard among Burmese expatriates in Bangkok is that their embassy 
on Pan Road has recently been told (faxed) by Rangoon to 
persuade Thai authorities to stop issuing work permits to its 
nationals applying for jobs in Bangkok. 
  The gist of the seminar on "Human Rights Violation in Burma" 
was that the Government ought to review its invitation to Burma, 
and the subject of human rights in that country should be raised 
for discussion at the ASEAN meeting. And if Slorc is to attend 
the Bangkok session, then Burmese democratic representatives 
should be extended the same privilege. 
  We believe the Government should give these suggestions some 
serious thought. Unlike our unfortunate eastern neighbours, in 
an open society like ours where we have a democratically elected 
government and the freedom to express our opinions, it is only 
fair we listen to both sides of the story. 
  Take up the challenge and invite the Burmese opposition as 
well. If this country is to play host to a government not 
recognised by its people, then it should also be willing to deal 
with members of the National League for Democracy which were 
elected by the Burmese people but ignored by a handful of 
generals whose main concern is self-preservation. 
  This Government can no longer go on claiming -- nor can its 
ASEAN partners, for that matter -- that it does not believe in 
interfering in the "internal affairs" of a country. We are 
involved. We became entangled with Burma's affairs the day the 
"constructive engagement" policy was adopted. 
  Unlike most western and democratic governments which 
advocate 
isolation and sanctions to force the Burmese military regime to 
honour the results of the 1990 elections in Burma, we instead 
opted for the "gentle persuasion" approach to coax Slorc into 
returning what they have stolen from the Burmese people. It has 
been four years since Gen Saw Maung promised to honour Burma's 
call for a democratic government. 
  If ASEAN is serious in wanting to see a democratic 
government 
in Burma, then it should seize the opportunity at next month's 
meeting and invite the Burmese government-in-exile and members 
of the Democratic Alliance of Burma to sit down together with 
Slorc representatives to thrash out their differences. 
  Should Slorc agree to this meeting, we would know they are 
sincere about ending the civil war in Burma which has gone on 
for more than four decades. Striking ceasefire deals with the 
ethnic minorities alone is not enough. Slorc must also learn to 
come to terms with a government elected by the people. Making 
meat of one and poison of another will not work. 
  As for protests from Burmese students and dissidents in 
Thailand who oppose the ASEAN invitation, we don't think the 
Government need worry about disruptions at the meeting. The 
students have learned to live with whatever decisions the host 
country has made. They know they are vulnerable to harassment 
and arrest by the authorities if they step out of line. These 
new generations of Burmese have learned to be patient and bide 
their time if they are to win freedom for their country. 
  As a recent All Burma Students' Democratic Front statement 
on 
ASEAN's invitation to Slorc said: "The ABSDF respects the 
sovereignty of all the ASEAN countries and does not want to 
tarnish their image; and hereby declares that it will not commit 
any violent act on the soil of any ASEAN country." These 
children of the 1988 uprising have matured politically.

  [Excerpt] Members of the group Al Arqam from Malaysia are 
now active in Chiang Mai and Phrae Provinces under the guise of 
businessmen and pilgrims. They have tricked provincial 
officials into joining the group by promising them trips abroad. 
The new members were promised a visit to Malaysia free of 
charge; the single members were promised a chance to find a 
spouse. The group was earlier reported to have come from 
Malaysia to recruit men for arms training in Thailand. The 
Malaysian Government has asked the Thai Government to monitor 
the group's activities. 
  On 25 June, Al Arqam organized a meeting of members at the 
Nakhon Phrae Tower Hotel in Phrae Province. About 500 members 
from 15 countries attended the two-day meeting. Thai officials 
have been monitoring the meeting, which drove many hotel guests 
away due to fear of sabotage. 
  Abu Ya, president of Al Arqam told newsmen after the meeting 
that his group has no intention of carrying out sabotage or 
toppling the Malaysian Government as alleged by certain 
Malaysian ministers who fear that his group might be recruiting 
men to train for terrorist activities in Malaysia as the prime 
ministerial [as published] election approaches. Abu Ya said his 
group consists of businessmen who come to Thailand to find 
business partners. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The head of the office of southern border 
administration, Wisut Singkachonworakun, said yesterday there is 
no new armed group operating in the southern provinces. 
  Mr Wisut's comment was made after a news report from 
Malaysia 
that a powerful Malaysian Islamic missionary group, the Al-Arqam 
movement, was operating in Thailand, and that the group has 
maintained 313 armed men in Thailand including Bangkok. 
  "We checked with all our intelligence units, especially in 
the five southern border provinces of Thailand, and there is no 
report about the Al-Arqam movement existing." said Mr Wisut. 
  He said he has submitted an official report to the Interior 
Ministry on the issue. 
  "The report is inaccurate. We have thoroughly investigated 
and tried to find out about the movement of this group. But no 
report about it exists," he said. 
  According to Mr Wisut, the main problem in southern Thailand 
now is the economy, especially in the growth triangle area. 
  "We should push the economy to grow in this triangle," he 
said. 
  However, he admitted that in the past there was a lack of 
qualified public relations facilities to inform the public of 
events. 
  One of the main obstacles, he said, is a lack of cooperation 
between the government officials concerned. 
  The centre has tried to improve things by bringing district 
officers and police chiefs from all areas to discuss the 
problem, he said. 
  Future policy on the five southern provinces will include 
developing intelligence reports, tackling poverty, providing 
security and dealing with border conflicts between Thailand and 
Malaysia, he said. 
  Meanwhile, Malaysia's ambassador to Thailand will be 
summoned 
to clarify a claim that Bangkok was used as a base for training 
an armed Muslim suicide squad, Deputy Foreign Minister Surin 
Phitsuwan said yesterday. 
  Thailand would take the opportunity to make clear its stance 
on the issue, Mr Surin added. 
  Thai Ambassador to Malaysia Suraphong Posayanon last week 
put 
on record in Malaysia that there was no evidence to back a claim 
by the Islamic Centre in Kuala Lumpur that Al-Arqam was training 
a suicide squad in Bangkok. 
  The envoy also confirmed Thailand's readiness to cooperate 
in 
solving the issue. 
  Al-Arqam is an Islamic group headquartered in Malaysia, with 
branches in 15 other countries including Thailand. 
  The group promotes religious as well as business activities, 
including the purchase of agricultural products for farmers. 
  A Thai government source said it made no sense for Bangkok 
to 
be the training ground for a suicide squad. 
  The claim emerged after Thailand caught Iranians, suspected 
of involvement in an attempt to bomb the Israeli embassy in 
Bangkok, re-entering the country from Malaysia about three weeks 
ago, the source said.

  [Text] A senior UN official reported that Australia, 
Canada, and the United States expressed their desire for a 
quicker repatriation of Hmong refugees to Laos by creating 
industrial jobs in LPDR for them. Those Hmong hilltribesmen 
have been living at refugee centers in Thailand for almost 20 
years and have become urbanized. It is not enough to just 
arrange for those people to return and settle down in the 
countryside of Laos. 
  UNHCR Representative to Thailand Ruprecht von Arnim proposed 
that an industrial zone be established in Laos where those 
refugees can make goods like garments or shoes. The UNHCR 
representative to Thailand and senior officials of Laos and 
Thailand are meeting in Bangkok on 27-28 June to discuss the 
repatriation of Lao refugees. The Thai delegation is led by 
Khachatphai Burutphat, deputy secretary general of the National 
Security Council. The Lao delegation is led by a director 
general from the Lao Foreign Ministry. 
  The meeting will try to find ways to speed up repatriation 
of 
Lao refugees in accordance with the wishes of Thailand. 
Thailand reiterated its plan to close Ban Na Pho center by the 
end of this year. There are at present about 12,000 refugees at 
the center which is in Nakhon Phanom. It is believed only 3,000 
will leave for Laos in the next six months.

  [Text] Thailand has proposed that the repatriation of 
Laotian refugees be integrated into the comprehensive Geneva 
plan for Indochinese refugees to allow a one-year extension of 
the process under the present agreement which expires at the end 
of this year, a reliable source said. 
  The proposal, which has received the UN High Commissioner 
for 
Refugees' (UNHCR's) blessing, also called for the setting up of 
a reception center in Laos which would provide the returnees 
with job training before they are integrated into Laotian 
communities, according to the source who attended a meeting on 
the subject yesterday. 
  At the tripartite meeting, Thailand and the UNHCR tried to 
convince Laos to accept the proposal, which they believe would 
be acceptable to the Geneva-based office, the source said. 
  Under a 1991 tripartite agreement, the remaining Laotian 
refugees in Thailand must be sent back by the end of this year. 
However, the agreement was not included in the UNHCR's 
comprehensive plan of action, which stipulated that all 
Indochinese refugees must return by the end of 1995. 
  Participants in the two-day technical meeting discussed the 
problems and obstacles in the repatriation process and explored 
ways to speed up the repatriation of approximately 12,000 
mainly-highlander Laotians remaining in Thailand's last holding 
camp in Ban Na Pho, Nakhon Phanom province. 
  The National Security Council (NSC) announced earlier this 
year that it would close Ban Na Pho at the end of this year. Of 
those remaining, only about 2,000 have expressed willingness to 
repatriate. The rest, mostly Hmong hilltribe people, have 
reportedly refused to return, wanting instead to resettle in a 
third country. 
  Don Somvolachit, director of Laos' Department of Europe and 
America, who headed the Laotian delegation, said Laos fears the 
reception center would swell into a permanent resettlement site. 
  He said Laos prefers long-term rural development projects in 
which both the returnees and current residents would benefit. 
He said the projects could be agriculture-oriented and equipped 
with public amenities. 
  "There must be land and housing ready, international funding 
and they must resettle in areas provided for them and according 
to the tripartite plans," Don said. 
  He said Vientiane is willing to take back all the remaining 
refugees but it would be impossible without funding. He said 
even if all 12,000 wanted to return, it "would not be easy. It 
would require a large investment of money and time to 
accommodate all of them." 
  He emphasized that Vientiane would only accept voluntary 
returnees. "We want to help them return safely and with 
integrity but they must also help themselves." 
  He categorized the potential refugees into three groups: 
individual returnees, small groups of five to 10 families, and 
groups of more than 10 families. 
  He said the individuals would readjust easily into society 
because most have families in Laos. The small groups also would 
integrate well into existing communities but they need the UNHCR 
to provide basic facilities such as schools, hospitals, and 
roads to counteract possible rejection from the local 
population. The large groups would be more difficult to handle 
because special sites must be provided for them as rural 
development projects. 
  Don said a major problem is that most returnees want to live 
in or near Vientiane or, in the case of the Hmong, in the 
mountainous north. 
  Asked whether there should be legal guarantees for the 
safety 
of the returnees, Don said the tripartite agreement already 
provided for their protection and that the early returnees could 
counsel those who have not yet returned about the new life back 
home.

  [Text] Chiang Mai -- Deputy Communications Minister Charat 
Phuachuai told KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT that the cabinet in May 
approved a budget of 35 million baht for the Communications 
Minister to help Laos build a road from Houai Sai District of 
Bokeo Province to Luang Namtha Province. 
  The road is about 255 kilometers long and the survey work 
will take about six months to complete. The Lao Government, 
being aware of the good intentions of the Thai side, has 
notified the Thai Goverment that it is now ready to provide all 
the necessary conveniences for Thai survey teams to start their 
operation. 
  The construction of the road is expected to cost more than 
1,275 million baht -- 80 percent of which will come from a loan 
from the Asian Development Bank and the rest from financial 
institutions of the Thai Government. 
  Charat disclosed that a Thai private firm has conducted a 
survey for the road construction two years ago and offered to 
get loans to finance the project. However, the Lao Government 
is still considering the conditions offered by the Thai company. 
  Touching on the quadruple economic development scheme, the 
deputy minister revealed that two piers, each cost 20 million 
baht, will soon be built at Chiang Khong and Chiang Saen 
Districts of Chiang Rai Province. 
  Two Thai-Chinese joint ventures have also received approval 
from the Lao Government to operate boat services from northern 
Thailand to southern China. Another Thai company will also 
operate a passenger boat service along the Mekong River. The 
Thai Government will provide assistance in the form of equipment 
and communications facilities to these companies. 
  Meanwhile, the Thai Government is lobbying for the opening 
of 
aviation services between Chiang Mai Province and China's 
Xishuang Banna region and between Xishuang Banna, Luang Prabang, 
and Kunming. At present, tourists and business people have to 
depend on the regular Chiang Mai-Kunming flight for travel from 
northern Thailand to southern China.

  [Text] Production of opium in Thailand has fallen from 150 
to 20 tons a year, the secretary-general of the Office of the 
Narcotics Control Board claimed yesterday. 
  Pol Gen [Police General] Chawalit Yotmani, speaking at a 
panel discussion on "Drugs As the World's Problem," claimed the 
reduction reflects the efficiency and hard work of the police in 
conducting raids on a large number of opium plantations. 
  But to reduce opium production further, the demand for drugs 
must be reduced, Pol Gen Chawalit said. 
  To suppress drugs in Northern Thailand, the government must 
speed up the development of the region as the hub of the 
Economic Quadrangle. 
  Convenient transportation resulting from development will 
help the police suppress drugs more effectively, he said. 
  If people have better jobs, better financial status and 
better standard of living, they will never grow opium or get 
involved with drugs. 
  Warm family relationships will help protect children from 
drugs, he suggested. 
  Thailand consumes about 40 tons of opium a year, half of 
which is produced locally and half brought from neighbouring 
countries, especially Burma and Laos. 
  Thailand has asked the Burmese government to tackle its 
drugs 
problem, without success because that government's battles 
against rebel minority groups have prevented it from 
concentrating on narcotics. 
  He said sentences for people involved in drugs in Thailand 
are lighter than those of other countries. 
  In Malaysia, those guilty of possession of 15 grammes of 
heroin face capital punishment, while in Thailand the figure is 
100 grammes. 
  The Narcotics Control Board's assistant director-general, 
Pol 
Lt Gen [Police Lieutenant General] Kowit Phakdiphum, pointed out 
during the discussion that the main production point is in the 
Golden Triangle. 
  Most drugs delivered abroad, especially to the United 
States, 
pass through the region from neighbouring countries, adding to 
the number of drug addicts in Thailand, Pol Lt Gen Kowit said. 
  He cited a police report which estimated that about 2,700 
tons of opium were produced in the Economic Quadrangle area last 
year, 70 per cent of which was produced in Burma, 20 per cent in 
Laos and 10 per cent in Thailand. 
  The work of combating the narcotics trade is an "unending 
job," he said. Police are unable to arrest the big drug 
traffickers. Most traffickers arrested are small fry. 
  It takes a lot of police time to gather sufficient evidence 
to arrest the big fish, and most of them are "influential 
people". 
  It is a risky job for police to carry out raids without the 
help of their leaders, he said. 
  It is necessary to beef up the law to give police more 
responsibility and authority to deal with drug traffickers, he 
said. 
  The initial anti-money laundering law put to the cabinet by 
Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan will help the authorities 
deal with drug traffickers but it must be handled carefully as 
it may affect innocent businessmen, he said. 
  The tax system can also help check the sources and amount of 
money suspected to have come from the drugs business. 
  Mr Pakon Thawisin, executive director of Thai Thanu Bank Co 
Ltd, said he will co-operate with police if there is a law 
authorizing them to inspect the bank accounts of suspects. 
  Such a law should include measures to protect bankers from 
being sued for failing to respect client confidentiality, Mr 
Pakon said. 
  He said the forms of investment in Thailand are different 
from those of foreign countries because people use more cash 
here. It is not easy to check on what kinds of investment they 
are really making. 
  Any money-laundering bill should be drawn up 
comprehensively, 
because honest businessmen could be affected. 
  The president of Chiang Rai Chamber of Commerce, Dr 
Thanomsak 
Seriwityasawat, said the province has great potential in many 
investment fields. 
  All relevant provincial authorities are working hard to 
develop the province as a gateway to Indochina. 
  He said one way of tackling the drugs problem is to develop 
the province's economic growth, to which the tourist industry is 
acknowledged as an important contributor.

  [Text] Chiang Rai police yesterday seized a large cache of 
assault rifles and ammunition, and arrested a man who claimed 
the weapons were destined for drug warlord Khun Sa for use 
against Burmese government troops. 
  The 267 AK-47 rifles and ammunition were worth an estimated 
Bt[baht]3 million, police said. They had come from the 
Cambodian border area and were to be resold for profit. 
  Police said the arrested man Thanong Phrapphradon, 29, of Sa 
Kaeo province, said that the weapons belong to Somphong Songsuk, 
23, of the same province. 
  Thanong was travelling in a six-wheel truck with another man 
when police at a checkpoint in Chiang Rai's Mae Chan district 
signalled them to stop. 
  The vehicle allegedly drove through the barricade. Police 
chased the vehicle, which they later found abandoned. The two 
men were running away. Thanong was arrested but his comrade is 
still at large. 
  The weapons were found in the back of the truck hidden under 
a pile of pumpkins.

projects as one of [words indistinct] in developing countries to 
be financed by official credits in the next fiscal year, 
beginning next April. 
  The project of this new airport will be built south of the

  [Text] Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, says 
the recent crackdown on press freedom in Indonesia has not 
signalled a move away from liberalization by Jakarta. Senator 
Evans says he believes Prime Minister Paul Keating will raise 
the banning of three Indonesian news magazines with President 
Suharto during his visit to indonesia. Mr. Keating leaves for 
Jakarta tomorrow. 
  Speaking on commercial television, Senator Evans said that 
Indonesian society was undergoing profound change and setbacks 
were unavoidable. 
  [Begin Evans recording] This is part and parcel of the 
bumps, and grinds and advances and retreats that are associated 
with a major society in the process of major transition. I 
think the underlying movement is clear and upward and onward and 
all those fronts but there is bound, I fear, to be some retreat 
along the way. [end recording]

  [Text] Australia's prime minister, Paul Keating, is on his 
way to Indonesia for a two-day visit, refusing to say whether he 
will raise Jakarta's magazine bans when he meets President 
Suharto on Tuesday. Linda Mottram reports that Mr. Keating also 
used a final parliamentary question time prior to his departure 
to reassert his right to discuss his republican agenda for 
Australia while overseas. 
  [Begin recording] [Mottram] Mr. Keating's visit will focus 
on trade as well as the APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Forum] 
leaders' meeting to be held in Jakarta later this year. In 
parliament, Mr. Keating said the relationship with Indonesia is 
a high objective for the Australian Government. But, responding 
to opposition questioning on the magazine ban issue, Mr. Keating 
said Australia's concerns had already been voiced, refusing to 
say whether he would raise the matter with President Suharto. 
  [Keating] I am not in the business of saying to the leader 
of the opposition on the [words indistinct] what I'll say 
because it [words indistinct] before I say it. 
  [Mottram] Mr. Keating was also pressed by the opposition on 
his comments two years ago in Jakarta about wanting to see a new 
Australian flag. Mr. Keating again distinguished his right to 
articulate his government's policy on an Australian Republic, 
but he avoided reference to the flag. [end recording]

  [Text] Fiji's prime minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, has moved to 
allay opposition's doubts about his commitment to a review of 
the country's racially-based Constitution. In Parliament, Mr. 
Rabuka moved that a joint select committee be set up to assist 
the planned commission to review the Constitution by 1997. He 
said the joint committee would comprise 55 percent Fijian, 
Rotuman, and general or mixed-race members of Parliament and 45 
percent Indians. Mr. Rabuka said he was bringing forward his 
motion to allay fears and remove doubts about the government's 
commitment to the constitutional review. The prime minister's 
motion was supported by both sides of the House. 
  The move came one week after the opposition leader, Jai Ram 
Reddy, expressed doubts about Mr. Rabuka's sincerity after an 
outburst in Parliament by the prime minister. Mr. Rabuka, who 
led two coups against the Indian-dominated government elected in 
1987, said he could not guarantee there would not be another 
coup if indigenous Fijians continue to feel disadvantaged.

  [Text] Port Vila, June 28 (AFP) -- Vanuatu will maintain a 
ban on log exports and cut back licences for foreign companies 
operating on the timber-rich island of Erromono Prime Minister 
Maxime Carlot said Tuesday. 
  "If you added all the logging quotas allowed so far, this 
would mean that in no time, Erromango would become a desert", 
Carlot told AFP in an interview. 
  He said his government would risk legal action for breach of 
contract over the ban, imposed on June 20 because of mounting 
concern about exploitation of Vanuatu's natural resources by 
foreign companies. 
  European Union member countries represented here officially 
expressed concern to Carlot over logging in the island state 
last May. 
  An estimated 8,000 cubic meters (10,400 cubic yards) of logs 
is stockpiled at the Erromango port of Ipota after a ship from 
Hong Kong was forced to leave the island state's capital Port 
Vila without its cargo. 
  Carlot denied any official protest had been received from 
the 
companies. But said he had suggested to them that they bring 
the facilities to mill the logs here. "If they did that, they 
would gain in the long run", he said. 
  He met officials from the logging companies currently 
licensed to operate on the southern Vanuatu island, two from 
Malaysia, one Chinese and a Malaysia-Vanuatu joint-venture. 
  "At one stage, quite a few ministers came to tell me that 
such and such a company was bad and that this other one was good 
and now, there are four companies licensed to operate on 
Erromango and export the unprocessed logs." 
  Carlot said according to new government policy guidelines, 
Malaysian company Parklane, forced last week to suspend 
operations, would be allowed to log 15,000 cubic meters a year. 
Two others, Pacific Veneers and Erro Lumber, would be allowed 
5,000 cubic metres each. 
  The Chinese-based Kingwood company would be denied the right 
to log on Erromango and would have to negotiate on another 
island. 
  "I know some companies won't be happy and will put the 
pressure on us to obtain what they want," said Carlot. 
  "But as long as I'll be here, they won't get their way. By 
doing this, I think I'm protecting the future generations."

  [Text] China's embassy in Wellington has protested strongly 
against New Zealand's decision to grant residence to up to 600 
Chinese dissidents. The embassy first secretary, (Wu 
Changshui), said China had no objection to legal immigration, 
but the decision by the New Zealand Government was linked with 
Chinese internal affair and not in keeping with the facts. He 
said it was entirely unacceptable to China. 
  Permanent residency status has been given to up to 600 
Chinese students who fear going back to China since the 1989 
crushing of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing. The Chinese 
Students Association in Wellington says it welcomes New 
Zealand's decision and says it believes the Chinese granted 
residency will make a part of the contribution to New Zealand's 
economy and culture.

  [Text] Wellington, June 27 (AFP) -- New Zealand's central 
Reserve Bank signalled tighter monetary conditions Monday by 
calling for higher interest rates in the face of what it says is 
growing inflationary pressure. 
  The bank is required by law to keep inflation within a zero 
to two percent range, and in a six-monthly statement governor 
Don Brash cited pressures in the economy that could push 
inflation towards the top of the target range over the next 18 
months. 
  "Given the forecast outlook, the bank is comfortable with 
the 
slightly firmer interest rates seen recently, and some 
additional modest firming in monetary conditions would reduce 
the risk of inflation going above two percent," Brash said. 
  "More substantial firming is not yet required but would 
almost certainly be needed if signs of inflation pressures 
continued to accumulate," Brash said. 
  The bank did not see inflation taking off, but did forecast 
pressures that would push inflation to around 1.7 percent to 1.8 
percent in late 1995 and 1996. 
  "Inflation at those levels would provide little room for 
error and, with the economy continuing to grow strongly, we are 
more likely to encounter greater, not less, inflation 
pressures," he said. 
  A cautious tightening of monetary conditions at this stage 
would, by reducing the risk of a boom/bust economic cycle, help 
to extend New Zealand's current robust growth. 
  "We are in the midst of another period of volatility in 
overseas financial markets," he said. 
  "The bank tries to take a medium-term view of financial 
market conditions, rather than reacting to every period of 
domestic volatility induced by overseas developments. 
  "But if such impacts were prolonged or sharp, we could need 
to react in order to maintain price stability." 
  The bank said a distinct uptrend in underlying inflation was 
likely to emerge within a year. 
  "Our forecasts indicate that, in the absence of monetary 
restraint, a distinctly upward trend in underlying inflation is 
likely to emerge within a year," the bank statement said. 
  "The outlook for inflation presented in this statement 
underlines the importance of setting policy in a forward-looking 
manner. 
  "Inflation is currently near the middle of the forecast 
range. Our forecasts indicate that, in the absence of monetary 
restraint, a distinctly upward trend in underlying inflation is 
likely to emerge within a year. 
  "This suggests that somewhat firmer monetary conditions than 
prevailed in the March quarter are appropriate. Some firming, 
mainly through higher interest rates, has already occurred.

<F P=106> ["Keynote Speech by Chief Delegate of North Side at </F>
Preliminary Contact for North-South Top-Level Talks" -- KCNA 
headline] 
  [Text] Panmunjom, June 28 (KCNA) -- Kim Yong-sun, chairman 
of the Reunification Policy Committee of the Supreme People's 
Assembly and chief delegate of the North side, made a keynote 
speech at the preliminary contact for the North-South top-level 
talks currently under way in the southern portion of Panmunjom. 
  Noting that the reality facing the Korean nation now with 
one 
year to go before the 50th year of national division is grim, he 
expressed the belief that the holding of the North-South 
top-level talks would mark an important historical occasion in 
setting right the orientation of our nation. 
  He said: 
  The North-South top-level talks concern the prestige of the 
top-level authorities of both sides and the destiny of the 
nation and worldwide concern is focussed on the talks. 
  The North-South top-level talks must be successful talks on 
all accounts to promote national reconciliation and unity and 
give all the fellow countrymen bright hopes of peace and 
independent and peaceful reunification of the country. 
  It is our consistent stand to open a dramatic phase for 
achieving national reunification through top-level talks without 
any outside interference. 
  As your side knows, respected President Kim Il-song 
personally initiated top-level talks already when the 
North-South dialogue began in May 1972 and has made particular 
efforts to arrange meaningful top-level talks for the 
reunification of the country. 
  Our proposal in May last year for the exchange of special 
envoys was also part of the efforts for top-level talks. 
  But these efforts failed to bear a proper fruit. 
  It is, indeed, very lucky that the top-level talks which 
have 
failed to be realized for the past decades are going to see the 
light now, 50 years after division. Underlying this, I think, 
is the common stand of us concerned over the present and future 
of the nation. 
  We would like to believe that this stand is, indeed, a 
manifestation of the spirit of independence for shaping the 
destiny of our nation by the efforts of Koreans themselves. 
  We can say a success of the top-level talks is guaranteed, 
if 
the North and the South do not differ in this spirit of national 
independence. For, lying in this are the supreme idea that 
links the North and the South by one bond, the source of the 
nation's will and strength capable of shaping our destiny by 
ourselves, and a sure guarantee for defending the common 
interests of the nation without playing into the hands of 
outside forces that make scapegoats out of the interests of our 
nation. 
  If both sides proceed from this spirit of independence and 
national stand, the North and the South can get reconciled to 
and unite with each other, transcending all difference in 
conformity with the principles of independence, peaceful 
reunification and great national unity, break the deadlock by 
the united efforts of the nation itself and climb a peak of 
reunification and prosperity as desired by all the fellow 
countrymen. 
  The North-South top-level talks we are going to arrange will 
mean creating a great new history of the nation, an undertaking 
for turning the history of antagonism which has lasted for half 
a century in our country into a history of great national unity, 
and the history of confrontation into a history of peace, and 
the history of division into a history of reunification. 
  It will no doubt bring to our 70 million fellow countrymen 
bright hopes of reunification in the 1990s and restore the high 
pride of our nation with a fine history, tradition and 
resourcefulness. 
  It will also give great joy to the peaceloving people of the 
world who are concerned over the situation on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  This is our basic view of the forthcoming North-South 
top-level talks. Stressing the heavy responsibility of both 
sides in successfully preparing the historical North-South 
top-level talks, I would like to put forward our proposal 
concerning the basic matters that should be discussed at the 
current preliminary contact. 
  First, the venue of the top-level talks. 
  We propose that Pyongyang be designated as the venue of the 
top-level talks. 
  As your side also knows, respected President Kim Il-song 
already invited "President" Kim Yong-sam to visit Pyongyang when 
the latter active in an opposition party and "President" Kim 
Yong-sam has repeatedly expressed his willingness to meet 
President Kim Il-song at any place and visit Pyongyang. 
  We believe the designation of Pyongyang as the venue of the 
talks accords with this will of the top level of both sides. 
  Second, the date of the top-level talks. 
  We propose that the talks be held in mid-August. 
  We think it is a significant time because it is around the 
liberation day of August 15 both the North and the South 
celebrate. 
  Third, working procedures for the top-level talks. 
  Various working procedures must be discussed for the 
top-level talks. 
  We think it reasonable to discuss the working matters except 
such important ones as the venue and date of the talks at a 
contact of delegates -- a delegate and two support personnel 
from each side -- immediately after today's contact. 
  The contact of delegates may begin on July 1 and discuss 
the composition and size of the delegation, the schedule of 
stay, the dispatch of an advance team, the procedures of travel, 
offer of conveniences, guarantee of personal safety and other 
matters of working procedures. 
  Fourth, the creation of an atmosphere for the top-level 
talks. 
  We think it important for both sides to create a good 
atmosphere, if the talks between the top-level authorities of 
the North and the South are to be arranged with success. 
Therefore, we propose that both sides stop any act that may mar 
the atmosphere of the top-level talks from July 1. 
  This us our side's proposal concerning the opening of the 
North-South top-level talks. We suggest that an agreement of 
the preliminary contact for the North-South top-level talks 
containing this idea be adopted and published today.

  [Text] A vice premier-level preliminary contact for 
historic North-South top-level talks took place today in 
Panmunjom amid the attention of all fellow countrymen and the 
world, that earnestly yearn for peace on the Korean peninsula 
and the fatherland's independent, peaceful reunification. 
  With the attention of compatriots in the North and South and 
abroad and the world, who hope that North-South top-level talks 
will take place for the first time in the history of national 
division, which has lasted a half century, at the earliest 
possible date and, thus, open a new phase in the fatherland's 
reunification, and with the expectations of the world, Panmunjom 
was today filled with numerous reporters from the North and 
South and foreign reporters. 
  Members of our side's delegation led by Kim Yong-sun, 
chairman of the Reunification Policy Committee of the Supreme 
People's Assembly, and accompanying officials and members of the 
South side's delegation led by Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister 
and minister of the National Unification Board, and accompanying 
officials came to the preliminary contact at 1000. 
  At the contact, the heads of the two sides' delegations each 
made a keynote speech to express each's position on holding 
North-South top-level talks. 
  In the speech, the head of our side's delegation pointed out 
that he was pleased that both sides were holding a preliminary 
contact today after reaching an agreement on holding top-level 
talks. He went on to say: 
  We are very close to 1995, the year which all fellow 
countrymen hope will be the first year of reunification, and 
leave but one year before the 50-year mark of national division 
which we should no longer pass over. 
  However, the reality facing our nation is grave. 
Misunderstanding, distrust, enmity, and confrontation between 
the North and the South have been intensified, rather than being 
removed, and they have been even further promoted by outside 
forces. In such a situation, we were faced with a dangerous 
phase where even unstable peace would be endangered. 
  Our people are now at the crossroads of choosing one of two 
roads, either peace or war, or reunification or national common 
destruction [minjogui kongmyorinya], which cannot coexist. 
  At this solemn point, all fellow countrymen are looking to 
the patriotic determination [aegukchogin kyoltanul] of the 
top-level leaders of both sides more ardently than ever before. 
  We firmly believe that the convocation of top-level talks 
between the North and the South will be an important historic 
occasion for correctly setting the direction of our nation. 
  The North-South top-level talks should become, at any cost, 
successful talks that will give all fellow countrymen a bright 
hope for national reconciliation and unity and peace in the 
country and its independent, peaceful reunification. We have 
consistently adhered to the position of marking the turning 
point for the start towards achieving the country's 
reunification through top-level talks without outside forces' 
interference. 
  The respected and beloved President Kim Il-song personally 
initiated top-level talks as early as May 1972, when North-South 
dialogue first began, and since then, has paid special attention 
to arranging top-level talks, which will be of significance for 
the country's reunification. 
  Our proposal for the exchange of special envoys in May last 
year was also part of our efforts for top-level talks. However, 
these efforts failed to bear due fruit. 
  It is indeed fortunate that the top-level talks which failed 
to be realized for the scores of years in the past have come to 
witness their rays for the first time today, 50 years since the 
country was divided. We think that precisely in this foundation 
lies our common position of worrying over the nation's present 
and future. We would like to believe that this position is 
precisely a manifestation of the independent spirit of shaping 
the nation's destiny with our Korean people's own strength. 
  We can say the success of the top-level talks is guaranteed 
if the North and the South do not differ in this spirit of 
national independence because lying in this spirit of national 
independence is the supreme idea that links the North and the 
South by one bond--the source of the nation's will and strength 
capable of shaping our destiny by ourselves--and a sure 
guarantee for defending the common interests of the nation 
without playing into the hands of outside forces that make 
scapegoats out of the interests of our nation. 
  If the two sides start with this independent spirit and the 
nation's position, the North and the South will be able to 
achieve reconciliation and unity after easily transcending all 
differences in accordance with the principles of independence, 
peaceful reunification, and great national unity; overcome the 
difficult situation with the nation's united national 
independent strength; and, thus, stand on the peak of 
reunification and prosperity which all fellow countrymen desire. 
  The North-South top-level talks that we are now going to 
arrange, will become the creation of a great new national 
history where the history of antagonism that continued for half 
a century in our country changes into a history of great 
national unity; the history of confrontation becomes a history 
of peace; and the history of division becomes a history of 
reunification. It will undoubtedly give our 70 million fellow 
countrymen a bright hope for reunification in the nineties and 
will also regain the great pride of our nation which has 
outstanding history, tradition, and wisdom. 
  This will also give great happiness to the world's 
peace-loving people who are worried about the situation on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  The head of our side's delegation stressed the important 
responsibility of both sides for the successful preparation of 
the historic top-level talks between the North and South and 
expressed the following position of ours on the basic issues to 
be discussed at the preliminary contact. 
  First is the issue of the venue of the top-level talks. We 
propose that the venue of the top-level talks be held in 
Pyongyang. 
  This is because when the South Korean side's president 
[taetongnyon] was in the opposition party, the respected and 
beloved President Kim Il-song already asked him to visit 
Pyongyang and because the South Korean president repeatedly 
expressed the will to meet with President Kim Il-song, 
irrespective of the venue, and visit Pyongyang. 
  Second is the issue of the date of the top-level talks. We 
propose to hold the top-level talks in mid-August. We believe 
that this date is significant because it is around the day when 
the North and South all celebrate the 15 August [national 
liberation]. 
  Third is the issue of the working-level procedure for the 
top-level talks between the North and South. 
  We believe that it is reasonable to arrange, right after 
today's contact ends, a delegates contact attended by a delegate 
to the preliminary contact and two accompanying officials from 
each side and discuss working-level issues, except for important 
issues such as the venue and date. The delegates contact should 
start from 1 July, and should be able to discuss the composition 
and scale of the delegation, the itinerary of the stay, dispatch 
of advance teams, procedures for visits, guarantee of 
conveniences, guarantee of personal safety, and other 
working-level issues. 
  Fourth is the issue of creating an atmosphere for holding 
the 
top-level talks. To make the talks, during which the top-level 
leaders of the North and South will meet, successful, we propose 
that from 1 July both sides completely stop all acts that may 
cloud the atmosphere for the top-level talks. 
  Then, the head of our side's delegation presented a draft 
agreement of the preliminary contact for North-South top-level 
talks, a draft agreement that contains the above-mentioned facts. 
  A sincere discussion took place at the preliminary contact, 
focusing on the venue and time of the North-South top-level 
talks. 
  At the contact which was held from 1000 until 1750, the two 
sides reached a consensus of views on all points in the 
agreement on holding North-South top-level talks, drafted the 
text, and adopted a formal letter of agreement. 
  The heads of the two sides' delegations each signed the 
agreement and exchanged the texts. 
  In today's contact, our side's showed sincerity and 
generosity to hold North-South top-level talks in compliance 
with all fellow countrymen's earnest desire and expectations.

<F P=106> ["Nuke Development is Impermissible" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 28 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
authorities' nuclear arms development can never be allowed, 
stresses MINJU CHOSON today. 
  Describing the June 23 memorandum of the Committee for the 
Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland as an indictment of 
their development of nuclear weapons, the news analyst says: 
  The South Korean authorities have long since promoted the 
development of nuclear weapons, laying stress on the development 
of reprocessing facilities. 
  The post-irradiation test facility in the Taedok complex is 
a 
reprocessing facility under the veil of "test." The facility was 
completed in 1985 and put into full operation in 1987. With an 
investment of tens of billions of won, it has been expanded 
into a large one today. 
  The post-irradiation test facility, closely linked with the 
multi-purpose research reactor, forms a plutonium production 
system. Its danger is increasing still further. 
  In South Korea, insufficiently spent nuclear fuel discharged 
from the heavy water reactor and the multi-purpose research 
reactor is systematically reprocessed at the post-irradiation 
test facility to extract plutonium. A total of 50 kg of 
plutonium has so far been extracted. 
  The South Korean authorities also scheme to import a large 
quantity of plutonium lawfully. The purpose of the development 
of a fast heavy water reactor they have promoted is the 
production and import of a large quantity of plutonium. When 
their development of a fast heavy water reactor faced strong 
opposition at home and abroad, they recently chose a remodeled 
light water reactor as the next-generation reactor. But this 
was intended to mislead public opinion. 
  Their development of nuclear weapons has got more 
undisguised 
these days. 
  The South Korean authorities must immediately give up the 
nuclear arms development and open to the public the truth of 
their nuclear arms development and apologize for it, as 
demanded by the Korean people and the world peaceloving people. 
  If they continue to proceed with nuclear weapons 
development, 
they will encounter stronger opposition from the home and 
foreign public and meet their doom.

<F P=106> ["All Matters Must Be Solved on Principle of National </F>
Independence"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 28 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comes out with a by-lined article calling for solving all 
matters for national reunification on the principle of national 
independence. 
  Noting that to adhere to the principle of national 
independence is an urgent demand for removing the danger of war 
created on the Korean peninsula and defending the exisoence of 
the nation, the article says: 
  Keeping to the principle of national independence 
constitutes 
the starting point in achieving national reunification, the long 
cherished desire of the fellow countrymen, and establishing 
sovereignty of the nation throughout the country. 
  Outside forces which divided our country will never make a 
present of reunification to our people. 
  If some forces intend to attain a sinister aim in reliance 
on 
the strength of outside forces, negating the principle of 
national independence, it may cause grave consequences of 
victimizing the whole nation at the hands of outside forces. 
  The reunification our nation wants is one to realize the 
independence of the nation, not one to live, shackled to others. 
  The principle of national independence should be thoroughly 
observed to realize the cause of national reunification in 
conformity with the interests and demand of our nation. 
  It is a lesson of history that if one depends on foreign 
forces and their interference is allowed, he will find himself 
in a miserable position in which he is compelled to study the 
pleasure of foreign forces even at the place of North-South 
dialogue and can not do anything for the nation, restricted by 
foreign forces. 
  Anyone who wants to establish the sovereignty of the nation 
throughout the country by reunifying the country must naturally 
take the patriotic stand of demolishing the wall of division, 
joining hands with the fellow countrymen on the principle of 
national independence. 
  Of importance at present in applying the principle of 
national independence is to thoroughly reject the idea of 
dependence on foreign forces, take the position of national 
independence and rely on the forces of national independence, 
not depending on outside forces. 
  Dependence on foreign forces is the road to division, war 
and 
national ruin, and only national independence is the road to 
reunification, peace and prosperity. 
  If the North and the South achieve peace and reunification 
by 
joining hands with each other, firmly adhering to the principle 
of national independence, the dignity and might of a reunified 
Korea will shine brilliantly all over the world.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 25 (KCNA) -- A stone plate bearing 
words about the birth of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il 
written 50 years ago appeared recently in Taegu, the Seoul-based 
radio Voice of National Salvation reported. 
  A scroll bearing the words "The bright star of Paektu is for 
independence of Korea. Let us uphold the bright star for the 
liberation of Korea and for the world generation after 
generation. 1944" was already discovered in Chorwon County, 
South Korean Kangwon Province, on February 10, 1994, the New 
Year's day of the lunar calendar. 
  An old man surnamed Ri, a retired professor of Kyongbuk 
National University in Taegu, on June 12 showed a round stone 
plate 15 centimetres in diametre he had kept carefully. Written 
on the stone with a writing brush are the words "O Korea, boast 
worldwide of the birth of the bright star of Paektu, successor 
to General Kim Il-song. 1944." 
  He said he found the stone, announcing the auspicious event 
of the nation, lying on the wooden floor under the eave of his 
house when he opened the door one morning in August 1944. At 
that time, a rumour was afloat that a big stone bearing the 
words "Long live the independence of Korea. Kim Il-song is 
coming" was found in front of the gate of the house of the chief 
judge of the Taegu district court. 
  "This stone plate is a most precious national treasure 
because it tells about the intense joy of our fellow countrymen 
at the news of the birth of the dear leader Kim Chong-il, and 
the historical fact that they highly praised him as the bright 
star of Paektu and the sun of the future," the old man stressed.

Workers Union entered a general strike at 4 on the morning of 
June 24, according to radio reports from Seoul. 
  Though the trade union had final negotiations with the 
company on their wages, the latter persistently refused to 
accept its demand. The unionists are now on a sit-in strike at 
Korea University, the Myongdong Cathedral in Seoul and two other 
places of the city. 
  The sympathy strike of subway workers in Seoul and Pusan in 
the wake of the start of the general strike by locomotive 
engineers throughout South Korea will tie up the traffic at the 
worst, said the reports.

<F P=106> ["Reckless Fascist Outrage" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 26 (KCNA) -- The South Korean police 
recently mobilized a huge force to brutally suppress rail 
workers affiliated with the National Council of Locomotive 
Workers on a sit- in strike for wage hike and improvement of 
working conditions. 
  In this regard, NODONG SINMUN today says this is an illegal 
fascist outrage and inconsiderable fascist violence. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The council urged the authorities to raise its workers' 
wages, improve the working conditions and reinstate the expelled 
workers. This, the minimum demand of the workers for their 
existence as human beings, should have been met by the South 
Korean authorities. 
  Nevertheless, the South Korean rulers have put workers on 
the 
altar of suppression, refusing to accept their just demand. 
Then, how can their behavior be construed? 
  It is ridiculous for the South Korean rulers, the guilty 
party, to threaten that they would "bring legal actions" against 
innocent workers, charging them with the "railway paralysis." 
  The fascists are calling the workers' sit-in an "illegal 
violence" and blaming them for the "railway paralysis," 
motivated by a criminal intention to shift onto the workers the 
responsibility for all the grave consequences to be entailed by 
the railway paralysis and harshly suppress and penalize them. 
  The fascist suppression leads to self-destruction. 
  The South Korean authorities would be well advised to 
promptly stop the fascist suppression, clearly mindful that the 
more harshly they crack down on the people, the more fiercely 
the people resist.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 28 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
opposition Democratic Party at a general meeting of assemblymen 
on June 25 contended that the strike of the railway and subway 
workers was attributable to the anachronistic labour policy of 
the authorities and their ruthless invocation of "government" 
power, a Seoul-based radio report said. 
  In a resolution it urged an immediate release of the workers 
whisked away and a halt to the invocation of "government" power 
against the strike. 
  The resolution said the authorities must solve the problem 
through dialogue with railway and subway trade unions.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 26 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
staged a provocative mid-air refuelling exercise against the 
North in the South Korean airspace day and night on June 23, 
military sources said. 
  The exercise involved two overseas-based refuelling tankers 
and scores of fighter-bombers and assault planes of the U.S. 
Airforce in South Korea. 
  The reckless play with fire was aimed at increasing the 
anti-North long-distance surprise attack capacity of the fighter 
planes of the U.S. Seventh Airforce. 
  The U.S. imperialists deployed Japan-based pursuit-assault 
planes and electronic jamming planes in U.S. Airforce bases in 
South Korea on the same day.

<F P=106> ["Extreme Fervor for Reinvasion" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 28 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comments on the growing danger of Japanese militarism. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The Japanese reactionaries dispatch more and more soldiers 
of 
the "Self-Defence Forces" [SDF] overseas for military exercises. 
They unhesitatingly utter such words as denying the criminal 
nature of the past war of aggression and inciting militarism. 
They undisguisedly work to fascistize the domestic system and 
legitimate overseas military action. 
  Through the enactment of an "emergency law" and revision of 
the "law on the SDF" they try to legitimate the overseas 
dispatch and military action of the "SDF" and mobilize the 
manpower and material resources of Japan lock, stock and barrel 
for military reinvasion. 
  Facts show the Japanese militarists, taking advantage of the 
failure of the policy of strength of superpowers, are going to 
revive the old empire and repeat the history of aggression. 
  The reinvasion fervour of the revived militarist ghosts has 
reached the extremity. 
  The Japanese reactionaries' talk about "threat" and "crisis 
in security" is an excuse for justifying their militarist acts 
for aggression. Under this pretext, they are inciting the 
consciousness of crisis and war at home and building public 
opinion to malrevise the "peaceful Constitution" and the "law on 
the SDF" and enact a wartime law. 
  The danger of revived militarism of Japan today is 
incomparably greater than it was. 
  Their acts for military reinvasion, however, lead to the 
same 
doom of Japanese imperialism that ran riot in aggression on Asia 
in the past. 
  They must learn a lesson from the past defeat and act with 
discretion.

Persecution of Koreans in Japan Held in Tokyo" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Tokyo, June 25 [dateline as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- 
An emergency meeting protesting the suppression of the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) by the 
Japanese police and its persecution of Koreans in Japan was held 
in Tokyo on June 21. 
  Attending it were Toshio Nejima, secretary general of the 
National Liaison Council of Trade Unions, Hiroshi Wakabayashi, 
secretary general of the Japan Committee for Supporting the 
Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea, and other 
public figures and citizens, more than 200 in all. 
  Japanese lawyer Shigeru Tokoi at the meeting roundly exposed 
the illegality and injustice of the search of the Osaka and 
Kyoto prefectural organisations of Chongnyon by the Japanese 
police and denounced it as a political crackdown designed to 
collect information for the destruction of Chongnyon and enact 
"an emergency law". 
  An appeal was adopted at the meeting. 
  The appeal said that the Japanese Government must 
immediately 
express apology and repentance to Chongnyon and Koreans in 
Japan. "The governmnt's policy must not be sanctions against the 
DPRK but the establishment of Japan-DPRK diplomatic relations 
and postwar compensation," it said, strongly demanding an early 
apology by the Japanese Government.

<F P=106> ["Central Meeting of Korean Mothers in Japan" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Tokyo, June 25 [dateline as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- 
A central meeting of Korean mothers in Japan urging a stop to 
the violent assaults on students of Korean schools in Japan was 
held in Tokyo on June 24. 
  Present there were first vice-chairman of the Central 
Standing Committee of the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) Yi Chin-kyu, delegates of local 
liaison councils of the associations of mothers, Korean women 
activists in different areas and Korean women, teachers and 
students. 
  A report and indignation speeches were made at the meeting. 
  Kim Il-son, delegate of the Central Liaison Council of the 
Association of Mothers of Korean Schools in Japan, said in her 
report that the violent assaults on students of Korean schools 
in Japan are a despicable violation of the human rights of 
children who should be protected most strictly in any society 
and a typical example of criminal acts of national chauvinism. 
  Noting that the Japanese Government could never evade the 
moral and legal obligations and responsibility to sincerely 
protect the Korean students and national education either in 
view of the crimes committed by Japan against the Korean nation 
and Korean residents in Japan in the past or in view of the 
world declaration on human rights and the convention on the 
human rights of the children, she strongly demanded that it 
should take responsible measures to prevent the recurrence of 
such human right violation and national persecution. 
  The speakers expressed their resolution to unite closely 
around the Chongnyon organization and make all efforts to bring 
up the children to be true Koreans, believing in the homeland 
and the Chongnyon organization in the future. 
  Read at the meeting were messages of encouragement from the 
Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's Union, the 
Education Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea, the Central Committee of the Trade Union of Educational 
and Cultural Workers of Korea, and co-chairpersons of the South 
Korean Federation of Women's Organizations, the South Korean 
Council of Measures on the Volunteers Corps Problem, and the 
South Korean Executive Committee of the "Asian Peace and Role of 
the Women". 
  Sumiko Shimizu, Social-Democratic member of the House of 
Councillors of Japan and other Japanese women activists who were 
guests at the meeting made speeches. 
  They demanded that the Japanese Government sincerely 
apologize for the colonial rule on Korea in the past. 
  Messages of request to the Japanese Government authorities 
and the Central Committee of the "ROK Residents Association in 
Japan" (Mindan) and a letter to the South Korean mothers and 
students were adopted at the meeting. 
  The delegation selected at the meeting went to the Japanese 
cabinet Secretariat, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of 
Education and Police Agency and handed the messages to them.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 25 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today 
observes the 19th anniversary of the independence of Mozambique 
and the foundation of its Republic. 
  Noting that the Mozambican Government and people have made 
energetic efforts to consolidate the independence of the country 
and build an independent new society under difficult conditions 
of unceasing interference and subversive activities and sabotage 
of the reactionaries within and without, the article says: 
  Measures have been taken in Mozambique to put an end to the 
civil war, ensure peace and achieve the security of the people 
and social development. 
  Pursuing an external policy of independence and 
non-alignment, Mozambique is developing friendly relations with 
surrounding countries and many countries of the world. 
  The Korean people sincerely rejoice over the achievements 
the 
Mozambican people have made in the efforts to build a new 
society, surmounting obstacles and difficulties facing them. 
  Korea and Mozambique established diplomatic relations in 
1975 
and have developed them in conformity with the aspiration and 
desire of their peoples. 
  Believing that the friendly and cooperative relations 
between 
Korea and Mozambique will develop further, the Korean people 
wish new success to the Mozambican people in their work for the 
stability and prosperity of the country.

With the People of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and 
the Maputo City Committee of the Mozambique Liberation Front 
Party in joint name on the occasion of the month of 
international solidarity with the Korean people. 
  Printed in it are articles headlined "U.S. imperialists, the

the Korean people," "U.S. imperialists, murderers," "U.S. 
imperialists, disturber of peace", "U.S. imperialism denounced"

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 26 (KCNA) -- The difficult promotion 
of peace process in Angola is a fruition of the sincere and 
strenuous efforts of the Angolan Government to solve the 
internal issue of the nation in the interests of the nation and 
in conformity with the cause of peace, says NODONG SINMUN in a 
by-lined article today. 
  The article says: 
  The Angolan Government set forth the principle of settling 
the present political crisis through dialogue and negotiation 
in the spirit of national reconciliation and has made consistent 
efforts to carry it into practice. 
  The government made arrangements for peace talks with UNITA 
[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola], took an 
initiative step for ceasefire and has striven to end the 
domestic revolt, cooperating with the international community. 
  The government side is striving for national reconciliation, 
territorial integrity and unity, showing a top patience and 
generosity at the talks. The good faith and generosity of the 
government side in transferring many seats of the regional 
government over to the UNITA, returning UNITA parliamentarians 
to the People's Assembly, and other matters show part of the 
honest efforts of the government to put an early end to the 
internal troubles lasting nearly 20 years at any cost. 
  The Korean people express solidarity with the Angolan people 
in their just struggle. 
  The master of Angola is the Angolan people themselves. If 
the sides at the talks, deeply conscious of this, make efforts 
for national interests and peace, the internal troubles would be 
ended and a bright vista be opened ahead of the Angolan people.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Kim Chol] </F>
  [Text] Turning cooperative ownership into all-people 
ownership is a historic event which completely changes the 
farmers' socio- economic relations. 
  In his classic work "For the Ultimate Solution of the Rural 
Problems Under the Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses," the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has comprehensively elucidated, 
based on his scientific analysis of the inevitable demand of the 
development of socialist society and the reality of the rural 
economy of our country, the theoretical and practical problems 
arising in the successful realization of the work to turn 
cooperative ownership into all-people ownership. 
  The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song has 
taught: We must solidify and develop the agricultural 
cooperative economy and successfully realize the work to turn 
the cooperative ownership into all-people ownership. 
  Turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership is 
an 
inevitable demand of the development of socialist society. 
  Socialism means society based on collectivism. The economic 
basis of socialist society is cooperative ownership and 
all-people ownership which are both socialist ownership. 
Collectivism demands that all social relations, including the 
ownership relations, develop continuously in the common interest 
of the entire society. 
  Turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership is 
an 
enormous social change, but this change is different from 
remaking the private ownership into socialist ownership because 
it is the development of cooperative ownership--which is the 
lower form of socialist ownership--into all-people 
ownership--which is the higher form of socialist ownership. 
Cooperative ownership--the lower form of socialist 
ownership--must develop in such a way as to enhance its level of 
socialization, and it must ultimately be turned into all- people 
ownership--the higher form of socialist ownership. When 
cooperative ownership is turned into all-people ownership and 
all the workers work incorporated into the unitary economy of 
all-people ownership, the communist principle of "one for all 
and all for one" will be satisfactorily embodied, thereby 
realizing the classless society. 
  Turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership is 
an 
important problem in the development of the socialist rural 
economy of our country today. 
  Under the wise leadership of the party and the leader, we 
have vigorously carried out the ideological, technological, and 
cultural revolutions in the rural areas in our country according 
to the basic principle for the solution of the socialist rural 
problems set forth in the rural theses, closely combining 
all-people ownership and cooperative ownership and continuously 
enhancing the role of all-people ownership. The chuche 
agricultural guidance system with the county cooperative farm 
management committee as its basis has been firmly established, 
its function and role enhanced, and the managerial and 
operational standard of cooperative farms improved nearly as 
much as the standard of advanced industrial enterprise 
management. With the active material and technological 
assistance of the state to the agricultural cooperative economy, 
production relations between industry and agriculture have been 
strengthened, all people ownership and cooperative ownership 
have been organically combined, and the material and 
technological means of all-people ownership accounted for an 
overwhelming share in agricultural production. At the same 
time, all cooperative farms firmly developed in the direction of 
large-scale all-people ownership system farms. 
  In our country, all the agricultural workers are firmly 
united in comradeship, helping one another; large-scale major 
nature-remaking projects--unimaginable in terms of private farm 
economy or small-scale economy--are underway in the rural areas, 
thus making the agricultural production develop at a high speed 
continuously. This not only demonstrates the superiority of the 
socialist rural economic system based on collectivism, but shows 
that the conditions are coming to maturity in our country 
whereby cooperative farms are gradually converted into 
all-people ownership farms. 
  In his work, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught 
that the work on turning cooperative ownership into all-people 
ownership be carried out gradually in conformity with the degree 
of maturity of all the conditions and possibilities. 
  Under a condition which is yet ripe ideologically, 
materially, and technically, hurriedly turning cooperative 
ownership into all-people ownership would prevail the unsound 
ethos of living idle in rural areas, thus dropping the 
agricultural productivity and laying a big obstacle in the path 
toward overall socialist construction. 
  The fundamental conditions for turning cooperative ownership 
into all-people ownership will enhance cooperative farmers' 
level of ideology and consciousness and will strengthen the 
material and technical foundations of the cooperative economy. 
  What is important here is the work of revolutionizing 
farmers 
and assimilating them into the working class by remolding their 
ideologies. Farmers' ideological consciousness works very 
importantly in the development of ownership relations. The work 
on turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership can 
never be realized without remolding farmers' ideological 
consciousness. 
  Originally, the existence of cooperative ownership along 
with 
all-people ownership is closely connected with the farmers' low 
ideological consciousness level, and their technical and 
cultural level compared to that of the working class. This is 
because ideological remnants of individualism and egoism in the 
heads of farmers are very conservative and are unlikely to be 
erased in a short time. Leaving these intact, the work on 
turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership will not 
only fail, but, even if it succeeds, it will bring about evil 
effects. 
  By raising the farmers' level of ideology and consciousness, 
we should let farmers become deeply aware that their individual 
interests lie in that of society and group and that their 
worthwhile life and happiness can be found in the prosperity and 
development of the socialist fatherland and in the prosperity of 
cooperative rural areas. We should also let them display high 
patriotic zeal and devotion. When these are fulfilled, we can 
then say that the important conditions for turning cooperative 
ownership into all-people ownership has been prepared. 
  Consolidating the material and technical foundations of the 
cooperative economy is one of the important conditions for 
turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership. The 
material and technical foundations of the agriculture is weaker 
than that of the industry. 
  Since remolding the people's ideological consciousness is 
connected with material foundations, and society's production 
relations are related with the degree of productivity 
development, consolidating material and technical foundations is 
an important problem rising in the work of turning cooperative 
ownership into all-people ownership. 
  The rural technical revolution's four tasks--irrigation, 
electrification, mechanization, and chemical application--set 
forth in the socialist rural theses have been basically carried 
out in our country. In doing so, we have laid solid foundations 
for modern agriculture and made a remarkable progress in the 
struggle to industrialize and modernize agriculture. We should 
further expand and consolidate the accomplishments achieved 
until now. We should also industrialize and modernize 
agriculture, and develop the farming method and land cultivation 
system so as to gradually eliminate the differences between 
industrial and agricultural labor and to resolutely increase the 
production efficiency of agricultural labor. With these 
conditions fulfilled, we can then say that solid material and 
technical foundations have been prepared for turning cooperative 
ownership into all-people ownership. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's illumination of the 
fundamental conditions for turning cooperative ownership into 
all-people ownership in his work comes as a guiding principle 
for triumphantly carrying out the work without any slightest 
deviation or turns. In his work, the abundant and profound 
experiences of the great leader, who led socialist rural 
construction at the van for a long time with uplifted banner of 
chuche are summed up, and our party's solid will to lead our 
rural area into the one road of socialism is contained. 
  In his work, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song also 
expounded in detail the question on how to carry out the work on 
turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership. 
  What is important here above anything else is that the work 
on turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership be 
carried out with the county as a unit. 
  Carrying out the work on turning cooperative ownership into 
all-people ownership with the county as a unit is related with 
the role and position assumed by the county in the socialist 
rural construction. In our country, the county is the base for 
linking the towns with the rural areas in all spheres of 
politics, economy, and culture, and serves as the basic unit for 
the direct leadership and management of the rural economy. A 
county has the farm machine stations, farm implement factories, 
irrigation administration offices, and other state enterprises 
which serve the rural economy, and equipment and farming 
materials are supplied to cooperative farms with the county as a 
unit. Therefore, cooperative ownership must be transformed into 
all-people ownership with the county as a unit. Even after 
cooperative farms are converted into the state farms of 
all-people ownership, the rural economy must be developed on a 
county basis. 
  The forms and methods of converting cooperative property 
into 
all-people property, too, must accord with the socialist rural 
economic system of our country and the specific situation in our 
rural communities. 
  Since a well-organized agricultural leadership and 
management 
system has been established with the county as a unit in our 
country, the most reasonable form and method is to convert 
cooperative farms in the county into state farms under 
all-people ownership and let the county undertake their unified 
guidance and management. This will make it possible to manage 
satisfactorily the farms which have come under all-people 
ownership, using and strengthening further the comprehensive 
leadership and management system of the rural economy and the 
material and technical means that serve agriculture, which have 
already been prepared in counties. 
  In a county of moderate size where the level of management 
of 
the county cooperative farm management committee and cooperative 
farms is high, all the cooperative farms and the state 
enterprises that serve agriculture in that county may be merged 
into a state farm with the former cooperative farms made its 
branch farms and the former enterprises its workshops. 
  The general farms, which have been organized as model units 
in Sonbong and some other counties through the merger of not 
only agriculture but also local industry, goods distribution, 
education, culture, health care, and all other local 
administrative and economic functions, must continue to operate, 
further improving their management. Even after cooperative 
ownership is converted into all-people ownership, all state 
farms should be managed under the self-balancing system and the 
socialist principle of distribution should be thoroughly 
implemented. 
  In particular, it is important to set up ways to avoid 
possible deviations and loss and in the course of transforming 
cooperative ownership into all-people ownership and must 
smoothly carry out the task. 
  Also important in the work of turning cooperative ownership 
into all-people ownership is making the county play an important 
role as the base linking town and rural areas and as an 
all-embracing unit of leadership and management to the rural 
economy. 
  Therefore, it is necessary to build up the county, further 
develop local industry, and improve education, culture, health 
care, and public welfare. The county must expand and strengthen 
the enterprises and the production establishments serving the 
rural economy to speed up the development of agriculture. All 
the counties must make it their major task to develop 
agricultural production and improve the living standard of the 
rural population, and must push forward the socialist rural 
construction. 
  In his classic work "For the Ultimate Solution of the Rural 
Problems Under the Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses," the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has set forth concrete tasks 
and means arising in the work of turning cooperative ownership 
into all-people ownership. This comes as a militant banner for 
the ultimate solution of the rural problems and the complete 
success of socialism. 
  All party members and working people should traverse the 
road 
of the socialism of our own style, the road elucidated by the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. By doing so, they should 
brilliantly accomplish the historic tasks of eliminating the 
differences between towns and rural areas, eradicating the class 
distinctions between working class and farmers, ultimately 
solving the rural problems, and realizing a classless society.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 27 (KCNA) -- An endless stream of 
people is flowing to the revolutionary battlefields and 
historical sites of Mt. Paektu area in the northern part of 
Korea. 
  In the last two months, they were visited by anti-Japanese 
revolutionary fighters, veterans of the fatherland liberation 
war, working people of various social strata and tends of 
thousands of students from more than 100 senior middle schools. 
  Going round the battlefields and historical sites associated 
with the history of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle of 
the Korean people, the visitors get a deeper knowledge of the 
glorious and brilliant revolutionary history of the great leader 
President Kim Il-song and his undying feats. 
  In Korea Mt. Paektu area is one of the main centres of 
education in the revolutionary traditions. 
  This area where the Mt. Paektu base was established in the 
period of the anti-Japanese revoutionary struggle has secret 
camps, secret liaison spots, bivouacs, battlefields including 
those of the Pochonbo and Taehongdan battles. 
  In June 1956, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il led a 
group of excursionists to hew the path of march to the 
revolutionary battlefields in Mt. Paektu area and wisely guided 
the work of well building up the revolutionary battlefields and 
historical sites. 
  As a result, statues of the great leader, towers and 
monuments were erected and revolutionary museums built in Hyesan 
City, the starting point of the excursion to Mt. Paektu area, 
Pochonbo, Chongbong and Lake Samji and other battlefels and 
hstorical sites. And preserved in their original state there are 
the historical relics and remains and slogan-bearing trees. 
  A mauser, binoculars, a field bag, a map and other 
historical 
relics used by President Kim Il-song in the period of the anti- 
Japanese revolutionary struggle are on display in the log cabin 
of the headquarters in the Mt. Paektu secret camp. The log 
cabin is near Chong-il Peak and Sobaek Stream. 
  The time-honored old home where dear Comrade Kim Chong-il 
was 
born preserve valuable historical relics he used in his 
childhood, as well as simple household utensils. 
  On the shore of Lake Samji where the great leader took a 
rest 
after advancing into the homeland with the main force of the 
Korean People's Revolutionary Army (KPRA) in May 1939, there is 
a grand monument consisting of 6-metre high large group 
sculptures portraying members of the KPRA and people of various 
strata, 85 in all, and a 50-metre signal-fire tower in a 
spacious area 400 metres in length and 250 metres in width with 
the statue of President Kim Il-song in the centre. 
  They are surrounded by the Samjiyon Revolutionary Museum, 
the 
marker of the historical relics, lodging houses and cultural and 
amusement facilities for the excursionists. 
  The revolutionary battlefields and historical sites in 
Pochonbo, Chongbong and Konchang, too, have been built up well 
as monuments of eternal value. 
  The Mt. Paektu area is famous also as a tourist resort.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said 
the United States should not have made negative statements on 
the proposed East Asia Economic Caucus [EAEC] until the East 
Asian nations had given their views. He said the United States 
should first listen to the views of the East Asian nations. 
  He said ASEAN will hold a meeting in East Asian countries 
soon to discuss the matter officially. He added that when all 
the East Asian countries have stated their views, then the other 
countries can give their comments. He said this after receiving 
the Russian Minister of Culture Yevgeniy Sidorov and the 
Secretary General of Libyan People's Congress on Foreign Affairs 
(Chad Mujabba) at his ministry in Kuala Lumpur. 
  He said for the first time, the East Asian countries should 
discuss the matter first as the issue affects them. Datuk 
Abdullah was asked about the government's efforts to make the 
EAEC a reality after the U.S. has opposed the proposal.

  [Text] Rangoon, 21 June -- David Abel, Burma's minister of 
national planning and economic development, told a Keidanren 
[Japan Federation of Economic Organizations] economic mission 
(headed by Marubeni Corp. Chairman Kazuo Haruna) that the 
Burmese Government plans to enact "a privatization law" to 
promote a shift toward a market-oriented economy and facilitate 
foreign capital inflow. The Keidanren mission is currently 
visiting Burma. The minister also said the government will take 
measures to enable foreign firms to acquire state-run 
corporations. 
  The Burmese Government has said if a privatization law is 
enacted, state-run corporations will be able to establish joint 
companies with foreign firms in various industries, and foreign 
firms will be able to have capital stakes in state-run 
corporations. The country has already enacted a foreign 
investment law and a domestic investment law. However, it has 
not had a comprehensive law on joint ventures in Burma. 
  The Keidanren mission also met with Khin Nyunt, first 
secretary of the State Law and Order Restoration Council 
(SLORC). In the meeting, Nyun called on Japan to actively 
invest in Burma's agricultural and forestry industries, and in 
programs to exploit natural resources. He also asked Japanese 
companies to bear the costs for constructing hotels for the sake 
of Burma's tourist development. 
  In response, Haruna first stressed the need for Burma to 
further promote democratization, and said: "Although the 
Japanese Government's Official Development Assistance (ODA) to 
Burma has virtually been suspended (except for humanitarian 
purposes), the private sector will work to promote economic 
cooperation, while observing developments in your country."

  [Text] There is a growing demand that the government 
should set target figures to narrow the price gap between Japan 
and other countries and to "reduce domestic prices to half." In 
this regard, the Economic Planning Agency [EPA] is assuming a 
negative stand. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata also showed his 
strong will to set target figures. But, many EPA officials are 
of the view that "since prices are determined by market 
mechanisms, including relations between demand and supply, it is 
difficult to set targets for the future" (according to a senior 
EPA official). Under such a circumstance, in which the people 
are increasingly calling for a revision of the price difference, 
the EPA, whose role is to keep an eye on prices, just cannot 
publicly oppose the idea of setting such goals. Therefore, it 
seems that the EPA is in anguish. 
  Revision of the price gap became a policy task of the Hata 
administration in lieu of a "plan to double actual income," 
which was introduced in late May. The prime minister submitted 
the plan to double actual income with an aim to lower prices of 
goods 20-30 percent. However, the plan has fallen through 
because the EPA opposed the idea of setting goals for lowering 
prices. At that time, the prime minister instructed the EPA to 
buckle down to the task of narrowing the price gap between Japan 
and other countries. The EPA was also determined to study actual 
measures to revise the differences at a meeting of the Price 
Stabilization Policy Council (an advisory organ to the prime 
minister), which is composed of representatives of each economic 
sphere. 
  On the other hand, at the Administrative Reform Council 
Promotion Council working-level meeting held early this month, 
the prime minister explained his positive view of setting 
medium-range target figures for narrowing the price gap. At the 
meeting, attendees expressed their views, saying: "We should 
aim at reducing price differences to half in five years and 
publicly announce this goal." It became such that "Numerical 
targets," which the EPA tried to annihilate, emerged under 
another form. 
  The EPA is positive about mapping out measures to revise 
Japan's traditional business practices, which are causes of the 
price gap, and improve industrial productivity. However, it is 
against the idea of introducing concrete numerical targets. 
  Economists, who work in the private sector, criticized the 
plan to double the actual income, saying it is "unrealistic." 
It seems that the EPA does not have influential supporters as 
far as the issue of setting targets for revising the price gap 
is concerned. The government started to map out measures to 
revise the price gap by holding a general meeting of the Price 
Stabilization Policy Council. However, it seems that heated 
debate will be held at this meeting too over the issue of 
setting target figures.

<F P=106> [Interview with Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social </F>
Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), by Soichiro Tahara, 
commentator and television producer; place and date not given] 
  Inside Story of the SDPJ's Withdrawal from the 
Coalition Government 
  [Tahara] First, I want to ask you about the Hata coalition 
government. The Hata administration has become a minority 
ruling government. It has become impossible to know whether the 
political world is making progress toward the coming political 
realignment or is possibly taking a step backward, losing its 
way. What do you think? 
  [Kubo] It is still less than a year since the coalition 
government came into being; therefore it is inevitable that 
there should be trials and errors. However, I think the current 
government will make progress toward a stable coalition era, 
even though it is going through such a process at present. 
  [Tahara] I think the greatest cause of the Hata 
administration's confusion is the withdrawal of the SDPJ from 
the coalition government. The media reported various reasons 
for the withdrawal, but what is the direct motive that made you 
think "there is no alternative but to withdraw from the 
coalition government"? 
  [Kobu] In the nomination of the prime minister on 25 April, 
the SDPJ voted for Hata in a body; therefore we had no doubts up 
to that stage. However, although there was a mutual 
understanding that immediately after the nomination there would 
be a party chairmen's meeting concerning plans for the formation 
of a cabinet, as well as a secretaries' general meeting 
concerning procedures for the formation of a cabinet, we were 
not informed of anything and the night fell. Before long, it 
was reported on television that the ruling parties, except the 
SDPJ, had formed a parliamentary group "Kaishin" [Renovation]. 
Although Komeito (Clean Government Party] knew of the fact, the 
party did not participate in the formation of "Kaishin." 
  For the coalition government to keep its stability and to 
perform its role in response to the expectations of the public, 
I think there must be mutual trust as a primary condition. 
There is no coalition without faithfulness. If a parliamentary 
group comprising 130 seats was to be formed without notifying 
the SDPJ and before the formation of a cabinet, and if the 
parliamentary group "Kaishin" was to take the absolute 
leadership in the formation of a cabinet as well as in the 
reigns of government, it was inevitable that a serious question 
had been raised as to the significance of the SDPJ's 
participation in the coalition government. 
  [Tahwara] In that process, did you not have a talk, for 
example, with Ozawa about "Kaishin?" 
  [Kubo] There was none. 
  [Tahara] Were you not informed of the matter by the 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]? 
  [Kubo] I was not informed of anything. On that day, 
Chairman Keigo Ouchi of the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], 
who had advocated "Kaishin," visited SDPJ Chairman Murayama. 
When the Japan New Party [JNP], in the days of the Hosokawa 
administration, suggested the formation of a parliamentary group 
"Kaikaku" [Reform], Ouchi opposed that together with Murayama. 
This time, however, Ouchi said, "There has been a change in the 
situation within the DSP since then, and it has become 
impossible to oppose the formation of a parliamentary group any 
longer. I cannot remain isolated in the party any longer, so I 
want you to understand my position." Chairman Murayama did not 
take Ouchi's visit seriously, thinking, "After formation of the 
cabinet, Ouchi will take a position approving the formation of a 
parliamentary group. That is the reason he took the trouble to 
come and tell me about it." 
  [Tahara] You did not think that a parliamentary group 
would be formed on that day? 
  [Kubo] Ouchi seems to have thought that he had done his duty 
by the SDPJ. 
  At about 2000 that day, we were informed of the holding of a 
secretaries' general meeting. At the meeting Ozawa said, "A 
parliamentary group called 'Kaishin' has been registered. In 
forming the next cabinet, the allotment of the position of 
ministers will be made on the basis of the numerical strength of 
each party -- 'Kaishin' -- 130 seats; the SDPJ -- 74 seats; 
Komeito -- 52 seats." I said in reply, "The problem is why the 
parliamentary group "Kaishin" has come into being. Telling us 
such a story at this stage makes us lose our interest in 
discussing the formation of a cabinet. The SDPJ itself has to 
make its position clear." 
  [Tahara] How did Ozawa respond to that? 
  [Kubo] Ozawa said, "That's too bad. There is no time for 
that, because we must form a cabinet some time today." Then, I 
replied, "Such an important change in the situation has to do 
with faithfulness among the ruling coalition parties. I will 
talk to you some other time after the SDPJ's position has been 
decided." Then, we parted. 
  At 2000 that day, a parliamentary group of 130 members, 
including Toshio Yamaguchi, was registered and accepted by the 
Secretariat of the House of Representatives. The fact that the 
parliamentary group was accepted at the same time as the opening 
of the secretaries' general meeting shows that there was an 
intent to form a parliamentary group before the formation of a 
cabinet. An important question the SDPJ has is what was its 
aim. I do not mind very much about the formation of the 
parliamentary group itself. 
  [Tahara] The parliamentary group was formed so that it could 
take the leadership in forming a cabinet, was it not? 
  [Kubo] I cannot help thinking that the matter was being 
conducted without the SDPJ's knowledge. 
  [Tahara] Was Ozawa too sure that the SDPJ would not withdraw 
from the coalition government? 
  [Kubo] Ozawa said to me directly afterward, "When Ouchi told 
me about 'Kaishin,' I thought that he had already told the SDPJ 
about it. The truth is that I agreed to the idea because I had 
always been in favor of it." 
  [Tahara] Is Ozawa the kind of man who did not inquire of you 
to ascertain the matter when he heard the story from Ouchi? 
  [Kubo] It may be that from his long experience in the ruling 
party, Ozawa thought that those who once took part in the reigns 
of government would not leave power easily unless unusual 
circumstances compel it. 
  [Tahara] To Ozawa, the withdrawal of the SDPJ was beyond his 
imagination. 
  [Kubo] To the SDPJ, political power and ministerial posts 
are the targets to which it should devote itself intensely for 
the realization of its aims, not the targets to which it should 
cling. 
  [Tahara] I see. The SDPJ devotes itself to the targets, but 
does not cling to them. That is where Ozawa made a mistake. 
  [Kubo] That is a natural thing to do from the viewpoint of 
the conservative party. 
<H5>  What Is the Condition for Returning to the Coalition </H5>
Government? 
  [Tahara] By the way, when you visited Dairen, China, on 21 
May, you held a press conference and caused a sensation by 
saying, "The Hata administration should resign en masse and 
establish a new, stable coalition government. If the Hata 
administration resigns en masse, is the SDPJ ready to join a new 
coalition government?." What is your real intention? 
  [Kubo] I had been thinking that this was the only way for 
the coalition government to gain the firm support of the public, 
so I conveyed my intention frankly. I never thought that would 
become such big news. 
  [Tahara] However, according to the opinion polls, the 
majority of the public thinks that the SDPJ will remain an 
opposition party for the time being, while SDPJ members seem to 
be relieved to be an opposition party. Therefore, your remarks 
have "betrayed" their expectations in a sense. You think the 
SDPJ should not remain an opposition party, do you not? 
  [Kubo] Taking the helm of state affairs is the broad policy 
of the SDPJ. 
  [Tahara] For this purpose, you can either join with the 
current coalition government or join with the LDP. Are you not 
taking the latter policy? 
  [Kubo] That is unthinkable. And we have no intention to 
join with the current administration, either. However, we have 
to make every effort to make the coalition government stable. 
  Hata's minority government will have no alternative but to 
resign after early passage of the budget, which has luckily 
gained mutual consent. Then political parties with will and 
zeal should get together, have a frank discussion, and establish 
"a third-term coalition government." Whether this third-term 
coalition government can be a stable, majority government is the 
crucial point of whether a future coalition era can be 
successful. Every ruling coalition party chairman can be a 
candidate for the head of the third-term coalition government. 
Hata can be the head. Even if Hata is elected, a new 
administration headed by Hata is not Hata's reorganized cabinet, 
but a completely new administration. That is why the SDPJ can 
join with it. 
  [Tahara] What is the SDPJ's condition for joining with the 
government after Hata reigns? Akira Yamagishi, chairman of the 
Japanese Trade Union Confederation [Rengo] proposes three 
conditions: (1) disband "Kaishsin"; (2) call the responsible 
person to account; (3) establish a new decision-making system in 
place of the former secretaries' general meetings. 
  [Kubo] I am in favor of the third condition. It is 
important that party chairmen's meetings should be clearly 
defined as a decision-making system. 
  [Tahara] Both Murayama and Ouchi expressed their 
dissatisfaction that a party chairmen's meeting had never been 
held since the establishment of the coalition government. 
  [Kobo] That is saying a little too much, because it was 
Yamahana who was the chairman of the SDPJ when the Hata 
coalition government was established. At that time, all the 
chairmen of the ruling parties were cabinet members, so a 
Cabinet meeting played the role of a party chairmen's meeting. 
However, along the way the chairmanship changed from Yamahana 
to Murayama. Murayama could not attend government ruling party 
chairmen's meetings because he was not a cabinet minister 
although he was the chairman of the party. It is a little 
unreasonable to say that there have never been party chairmen's 
meetings. 
  [Tahara] What about the first condition, the dissolution of 
"Kaishin?" 
  [Kubo] I do not interfere in the formation of a 
parliamentary group by like-minded persons, but on condition 
that the method of forming the group does not go against the 
faithfulness to be observed among the ruling coalition parties. 
In that sense also, "Kaishin" should be dissolved once. 
  [Tahara] What do you mean once? 
  [Kubo] If they stick to "Kaishin" at any cost, a conference 
among the ruling coalition parties must be a tripartite 
conference -- three persons representing "Kaishin," the SDPJ, 
and Komeito [Clean Government Party], respectively. Actually, 
however, the representatives of all the parties that compose 
"Kaishin" attend the conference for discussion. That makes one 
wonder what is the raison d'etre for a parliamentary group. 
  [Tahara] You mean to say that one representative from 
"Kaishin" is enough? 
  [Kubo] That is right. They talk with the backing of 130 
members when that is to their advantage. When numerical 
superiority makes things easier, the parties that comprise 
"Kaishin" send their own representatives. That is too selfish. 
  [Tahara] What about the responsibility for forming 
"Kaishin?" 
  [Kubo] I expect each party will take proper measures 
concerning the responsibility for having formed "Kaishin." And, 
if Prime Minister Hata has decided to resign en masse to 
dissolve the unstable minority government, the responsibility 
for "Kaishin" will be considered to have been determined. 
  [Tahara] You mean to say that a resignation en masse will 
exonerate them from their responsibility? 
  [Kubo] We donot insist forever that they punish someone or 
another. If we stick to that kind of thing, a coalition 
government will not be realized. 
<H5>  Is Ichiro Ozawa a Reliable Politician? </H5>
  [Tahara] An issue always raised by the media is the 
so-called "Ichi-Ichi [Ozawa and Ichikawa] team running out of 
control." You have actually attended secretaries' general 
meetings and talked to them in person. Does "running alone by 
Ichi-Ichi" really exist? 
  [Kubo] It is true that Ozawa and Ichikawa agree with each 
other on various problems. However, the rumor that the two men 
have taken leadership not only at secretaries' general meetings, 
but also in the decision-making process among the ruling 
coalition parties is not correct in my opinion. 
  [Tahara] So far, have you experienced a kind of surprise 
attack like the formation of "Kaishin," for example? 
  [Kubo] I cannot say positively that there has never been 
such an atmosphere. When the two men and I disagreed with one 
other, I stubbornly held out, reaching a conclusion through 
mutual concessions in the end. 
  For example, there was the problem of the national welfare 
tax. Ozawa and Ichikawa were in a position to encourage Hosokawa 
to implement it, but the SDPJ strongly opposed it. We even told 
Hosokawa that "we would have to consider bolting from the 
government," which brought about its withdrawal. 
  [Tahara] Before Hosokawa announced the introduction of the 
national welfare tax, was there not a general agreement on it at 
the secretaries' general meeting? 
  [Kubo] No, there was none. 
  [Tahara] What I heard from Shinseito and Komeito members is 
that the SDPJ must have known about it, however vaguely. 
  [Kubo] When Hosokawa said, "I will implement it on the basis 
of my judgment," I said in reply, "I have nothing to say if you 
assume full responsibility. But the SDPJ will not agree to it. 
I want to make that clear." And Chairman Murayama also said, 
"If you enforce it, we will have to consider bolting from the 
government." Then came a pre-dawn press conference. 
  [Tahara] Now this is important. As far as I know from my 
news gathering, the SDPJ had taken a rather vague attitude 
before the announcement, so Hosokawa and Ozawa judged that "they 
could carry it through." However, when Hosokawa announced it, 
the SDPJ's opposition was surprisingly enough stronger than 
expected. This is similar to the problem of "Kaishin." 
  [Kubo] At about 1900 before the announcement, a secretaries' 
general meeting was held in the Prime Minister's Office. At the 
meeting, too, I said, "The SDPJ cannot agree to it." Then we 
decided to meet again after each party had another discussion 
about the matter. 
  Afterward Chairman Murayama and I went to see Hosokawa and 
told him that "we could not agree to it," we had a dispute with 
Ozawa and Ichikawa when they said, "Why did the chairman show up 
here?" We said, "It is right that the ruling parties should 
work out a tax reform policy for which they can take 
responsibility. We are proposing establishing a deliberative 
body to have full discussions about the matter among the ruling 
parties. We cannot give our consent to the way decisions are 
made without regard to our proposal." Ozawa became angry and 
even said, "Then, shall we stop holding a secretaries' general 
meeting?" 
  [Tahara] I think that the withdrawal of the national 
welfare tax and the "Kaishin" turmoil were probably decided by 
Ozawa. Even if the SDPJ returns to the coalition government, 
can the party trust a man like Ozawa? 
  [Kubo] I have no intention of giving my advice to a 
politician who takes the leadership in a party. However, Ozawa 
and I have wide differences of opinion about the world and the 
way of conducting politics. However, we can take the helm of 
state affairs together concerning the problem of what to do with 
Japan for the present. 
  [Tahara] Why can you work together? 
  [Kubo] Because I think that our fighting in the same 
government helps to make the government sound. 
  [Tahara] You mean that your ideas are different from 
Ozawa's, but that you can work together because you have trust 
in him as a man and as a politician? 
  [Kubo] That is right. He is a very influential politician. 
It is amazing to see him go head on with his strategy with 
tremendous force. That is why we must be in the government and 
play the role of a powerful brake. 
  [Tahara] Ozawa plays the role of a powerful accelerator. 
  [Kubo] There are times when he plays the opposite role. 
There are times when Ozawa, on the basis of his world view, 
puts the brake on what the SDPJ is trying to do. 
  [Tahara] What do you think are the strong and weak points of 
Ozawa as a man? 
  [Kubo] Since Ozawa and I are incumbent Diet members, I had 
better not evaluate him a man. Anyway, he has thought-out 
strategies, pushes toward his goal, and fells the other man with 
force if necessary. These are his strong points. However, 
these are also his weak points, which can be the enemies of 
democracy. 
  [Tahara] A reckless man? 
  [Kubo] Probably, he does not think of himself as a reckless 
man. 
  [Tahara] Concerning the problem of "Kaishin," the media 
widely reported that Ozawa had launched a "surprise attack." Is 
he a man who uses such a trick? 
  [Kubo] I do not think he uses many tricks. 
  [Tahara] Now, this is a very important point. Ichiro Ozawa 
is said to be a man who plays tricks and streamrolls with force 
and numerical strength, and a politician who is capable of doing 
anything to achieve his end. He is not necessarily such a 
person? 
  [Kubo] His speech and behavior make me feel that he has a 
tendency to brush aside and ignore those who oppose his ideas. 
  [Tahara] Have you ever been tricked or ignored by Ozawa? 
  [Kubo] I do not think there were many cases like that 
between Ozawa and me. Since Ichiro Ozawa and Wataru Kubo were 
the farthest apart in the ruling coalition parties, we had been 
wary of each other. On the other hand, however, we had a sense 
of solidarity in that we were the support and driving force of 
the common government, so I do not feel I was betrayed or 
deceived. 
  [Tahara] You did not think you were deceived by Ozawa and 
the others in the "Kaishin" turmoil? 
  [Kubo] In the end, I think the SDPJ suffered what is 
commonly called a "surprise attack." If Ozawa participated in 
the "surprise attack," I will have to amend the image of Ichiro 
Ozawa that I had. However, judging from what I heard from Ozawa, 
he seems to have had no intention of "launching a surprise 
attack." 
  [Tahara] If Ozawa had launched a surprise attack, the SDPJ 
would not join with a new coalition government, would it? 
  [Kubo] A coalition government cannot be realized unless it 
is based on mutual respect and trust. In that sense, I have 
neither the feeling that I was deceived by Ozawa nor the feeling 
that I deceived him, although there were many times when we 
opposed each other, having different opinions. 
<H5>  The SDPJ, Too, Must Change </H5>
  [Tahara] You said before that there would be no coalition 
between the LDP and the SDPJ, but Chairman Murayama said, "If 
the LDP changes greatly, there can be a coalition with it." 
What do you think about this? 
  [Kubo] To my mind, a coalition between the LDP, with more 
than 200 seats, and the SDPJ, with 70 seats, is meaningless and 
impossible if their policies remain greatly unchanged. By "a 
great change in the LDP," Chairman Murayama meant a breakup of 
the LDP. I think that a coalition is possible if the extent of 
the difference is such that they can hold political power 
jointly with regard to their ideas and policies. 
  [Tahara] Then, if the SDPJ is to join with a new coalition 
government, what are the future plans of the SDPJ? Yamagishi 
and others propose "a union of liberal forces." 
  [Kubo] When the coalition government was established last 
year, I talked with Ozawa about the reigns of government for the 
first time. He said, "I will accomplish political reform 
through the coalition government and create an era of two 
conservative parties." I refuted him by saying, "You have 
bolted from the LDP because you thought that the current LDP 
cannot shoulder Japan's politics and that new conservatism must 
be formed. What is the meaning of a new conservative party 
competing with the old LDP for political power?" 
  The SDPJ must also change in the same way as the LDP. It 
would be ideal if a new-born SDPJ and like-minded people got 
together and formed a new reformist force, and if such a new 
reformist party and a new conservative party compete for 
political power. However, that will take considerable time 
under the current political situation. In that sense, I think a 
tripolar era will come: (1) an LDP which tries to transform 
itself into a new conservative party; (2) another conservative 
party centering around Shinseito; (3) a newly mustered 
reformist political force -- a force which is not particular 
about the history of the SDPJ or about the name of the party. 
It would be desirable for political power to be established 
through the union of either of the conservative parties on the 
basis of respective policies, with a new reformist party as the 
axis. 
  [Tahara] In that case, what would be the slogans of the new 
reformist party? 
  [Kubo] They would be "peace and justice," although they 
sound abstract. Thorough implementation of democracy and 
respect for self-government are the political methods to realize 
these slogans. The pillars of political measures to be promoted 
are disarmament, human rights, the environment, and welfare. It 
would be good if a wide circle of people who can agree on these 
matters got together. I do not think ideological problems are of 
great importance. 
  [Tahara] Then, that is not very different from conservatism. 
The other day I said to LDP President Yohei Kono, "What is the 
difference between the LDP's flag and Ozawa's flag?" Kono said, 
"Ozawa seems to think that the state comes before its people. 
But we want to built a nation for its people and for the 
benefit of its people." Fundamentally, there seems to be no 
difference between your thinking and that of Kono's LDP. 
  [Kubo] When Miyazawa became prime minister, I read his books 
or listened to his general policy speech, which made me feel 
that we had much in common. Kono may be the same. However, our 
political footings are different. Miyazawa changed when he 
became prime minister; probably he had to change. I once 
severely criticized Miyazawa saying, "There is a difference 
between what you have been saying and what the LDP is going to 
do." 
  [Tahara] I want to ask you about "peace" in your "peace 
and justice." In referring to peace, Ozawa says, "Japan must 
make a contribution to world peace. The United Nations must 
restore peace and order when they are disturbed. Japan should 
participate with the United Nations." 
  [Kubo] I also think that human cooperation should not be 
spared. However, it is clear that military cooperation is 
impossible under the current Constitution, and the United 
Nations has approved Japan's membership in it with the 
understanding of that fact. For this reason, Japan cannot be 
forced to make a military contribution under "the collective 
actions" listed in Article 1 of the United Nations Charter, nor 
should we choose that road. There should be other roles that 
Japan can play, excluding a military contribution, such as 
economic cooperation, medical services, natural disaster relief, 
and dealing with the aftermath of regional conflicts. To carry 
out such cooperation, I think it is better to raise forces 
equipped and trained in addition to the Self-Defense Forces. 
  In connection with this, there was an issue on which Ozawa 
and I had divided opinions to the last in the policy talks 
immediately before the establishment of the Hata administration. 
  [Tahara] That is the issue of collective actions and 
universal security, is it not? 
  [Kubo] Ozawa ventured to take up only collective actions 
provided for in Article 1 of the United Nations Charter. 
However, collective actions and peaceful means are written side 
by side in Article 1. Therefore I insisted: "Under the current 
Constitution, it is impossible for Japan to make a contribution 
to collective actions; therefore that should be deleted from the 
policy agreement." As far as peaceful means are concerned, that 
is, in my opinion, what Japan should do in response to the 
request of the United Nations, and there are ways of cooperation 
which can gain the respect of the world. 
  [Tahara] I want to ask you about universal security. If 
United Nations forces are dispatched somewhere, can Japan render 
rear assistance for the forces? 
  [Kubo] In my opinion, that is impossible. However, as for 
cooperation at military bases stipulated by the Japan-U.S. 
agreement, the extent of cooperation must be examined, to my 
mind. 
  [Tahara] Another word I want to ask you about is "justice," 
which seems intelligible but is actually unintelligible. What 
does it mean concretely? 
  [Kubo] Now all countries, including socialist countries, 
practice a market economy, and economic vitality cannot be 
produced unless the principle of competition is followed. And 
if the economy is activated, profit will become larger. 
Politics plays an important role in impartially distributing 
the profit among every citizen and every country. Concretely, 
"justice" has to do with the problems of tax systems and budgets. 
  [Tahara] What Ozawa is always saying is 
"self-responsibility" and "self-reliance." In short, an 
underlying principle is "free competition," from which the idea 
of "deregulation" is derived. "Justice" is a little different 
from "free competition," is it not? 
  [Kubo] That is right. I am opposed to the view that "every 
regulation should be abolished." To ensure social justice, the 
government must bear the responsibility for carrying out 
necessary regulations. The abolition of all regulations will 
bring serious consequences. 
  [Tahara] Do you mean that regulations are necessary for the 
protection of the weak and that the strong must be restrained? 
  [Kubo] That is right. 
  [Tahara] If free competition is carried to the extreme, the 
weak becomes the victim of the strong. This is where you differ 
greatly from Ozawa. 
  [Kubo] It is important to mind one's own business. However, 
as long as there is social inequality because of the existence 
of people who cannot mind their own business, the government 
must not forget to level off the inequality or to give political 
assistance; otherwise its reason for being is meaningless. 
<H5>  Why Is the Amendment of the Constitution Through </H5>
Interpretation Dangerous? [Tahara] In dealing with the problem 
of the Constitution, the SDPJ had once used the words "creation 
of the Constitution," which are a little unclear. What do you 
think about the Constitution now? 
  [Kubo] There is a question about the Constitution: 
"Germany has already amended its Constitution dozens of times 
since the end of World War II. Why is the Constitution of Japan 
a code of laws that will be in effect forever?" The German 
Constitution is an organic law, which is different from that of 
Japan which is an idealistic law. Therefore, I think it 
important to institute concrete organic laws under the idea of 
the Constitution of Japan. The problem of the environment as 
well as the problem of security was nonexistent when the 
Constitution was established. Concerning the idea of the 
Constitution, I think that we should not interpret it 
differently with the change of circumstances. As you know, 
procedures for the amendment of the Constitution are stipulated 
in it. We think highly of the Constitution, including the 
procedures. 
  [Tahara] In short, all we have to do is to amend the 
Constitution according to the procedures if necessary. 
  [Kubo] That is right. In other words, nothing is more 
dangerous than to promote policies, taking "amendment of the 
Constitution through interpretation" for granted. 
  [Tahara] Do you think that "amendment of the Constitution 
through interpretation" is in progress at present? 
  [Kubo] Yes, I do. 
  Ozawa's way of thinking is: We had better amend the 
Constitution through interpretation. It is a tremendous job to 
amend the clauses of the Constitution through those procedures; 
therefore the interpretation of the Constitution had better be 
done by the then incumbent government. I think this is a 
dangerous idea. 
  [Tahara] However, if "amendment of the Constitution through 
interpretation" is already in progress, there is no alternative 
but to amend the Constitution or to restore the interpretation. 
  [Kubo] "Amendment of the Constitution through 
interpretation" appears to be a concrete policy and is realized 
through its implementation. Therefore our duty is to change 
that in conformity with the idea of the Constitution. 
  [Tahara] To put it concretely, do you think that the Self- 
Defense Forces and peacekeeping operations of today go beyond 
the idea of the Constitution? 
  [Kubo] Yes, I do. Unless one recognizes the actual 
situation of Japan's society established through the procedures 
of parliamentary democracy under "the Constitution of Japan," 
one cannot join with the government. Therefore I am not of the 
opinion that unless a decision is reached as to whether the 
Self-Defense Forces are constitutional or not, one cannot join 
with the government. 
  [Tahara] This is an important point, so I want to repeat it. 
The Self-Defense Forces of today and peacekeeping operations go 
beyond the idea of the Constitution. However, their deviation 
is not an unlawful deviation in the light of the procedures of 
today's democratic society; therefore you approve of the present 
situation. The SDPJ wants to restore that to an ideal condition 
in the future by joining with the government. 
  [Kubo] That is right. To put it concretely, we promote 
disarmament, which has become the trend of the world. Although 
we do not know whether it will take 50 or 100 years, we should 
push disarmament while recognizing the existing circumstances. 
If we reach the ultimate in disarmament, there will be no 
disputes about constitutionality or unconstitutionality, which 
is the ideal of the Constitution. 
  [Tahara] Your ideas may conflict with the ideas of Ozawa and 
others. Your idea is that conflicts make things better and that 
things are kept stable through the relationship between the 
accelerator and the brake. 
  [Kuho] That is right. The characteristic of the coalition 
era is for people with different ideas to form a government. 
Basically, the Diet is exactly like that, is it not? If one 
says that people with different ideas cannot work together, one 
has to disband the Diet. The Diet is the place where people 
with different ideas have discussions and reach a conclusion. 
  [Tahara] A place where there is no accelerator or no brake 
is dangerous. At present the bureaucrats have only an 
accelerator and do not have a brake, which makes the situation 
all the more dangerous.

  [Text] According to a Communications Ministry report on the 
progress of the Thai-U.S. aviation talks, the United States sent 
a letter to the ministry announcing a change in the head of the 
U.S. delegation to the negotiations and asking to extend the 
two-day talks an additional day to 30 June. 
  The United States was reportedly not satisfied with the 
results of the last rounds of talks and therefore decided to 
appoint Mr. Thomas Mark [preceding three words in English] as 
leader of its delegation. It was reported earlier that the 
United States was unhappy with the U.S. delegation's lenient 
attitude in conducting aviation talks with Thailand and other 
countries in this region. With this change in the leadership of 
the U.S. delegation, the U.S. delegation's attitude is expected 
to become more aggressive and uncompromising. 
  Touching on the U.S. request to extend the negotiations with 
the Thai delegation, Sisuk Chantharangsu, head of the Thai 
delegation and director general of the Civil Aviation 
Department, said he cannot grant the request because he will be 
engaged in official business on 30 June. Meanwhile, the Thai 
side's conditions and positions remain unchanged. Regarding the 
third airline freedom, the Thai side demands at least 55 percent 
of through passenger traffic load and 70 percent of cargo on 
U.S. planes as the conditions for agreement on the fifth freedom. 
  It is anticipated that this round of aviation talks will not 
lead to any progress because of the ambiguity and rigid attitude 
of the U.S. side.

  [Text] A preliminary contact for top-level talks between 
the North and the South is continuing. 
  At the contact, Kim Yong-sun, chairman of the Reunification 
Policy Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, and head of 
our side's delegation, made a keynote speech. 
  The contents of the keynote speech are as follows: 
  Mr. Yi Hong-ku, senior delegate, and delegates of the South 
side, today we are seated together cherishing the important 
mission of preparing for North-South top-level talks. I am 
pleased that both sides are holding a preliminary contact today 
after reaching an agreement [kyonhaeui ilchirul pogo] on holding 
top-level talks. 
  We are very close to 1995, the year which all fellow 
countrymen hope will be the first year of reunification, and 
leave but one year before the 50-year mark of national division 
which we should no longer pass over. 
  However, the reality facing our nation is grave. Rather than 
removing misunderstanding, distrust, enmity, and confrontation 
between the North and the South, they have been accentuated, and 
even encouraged by outside forces. In such a situation, we were 
faced with a dangerous phase where even unstable peace 
[pulanjonghan pyonghwa] was endangered. 
  Our people are now at the crossroads of choosing one of two 
roads, either peace or war, or reunification or national common 
destruction [minjogui kongmyolinya], which cannot coexist. 
  At this solemn point, all fellow countrymen are looking to 
the patriotic determination [aegukchogin kyoltanul] of the 
top-level leaders of both sides more ardently than ever before. 
  We firmly believe that the convocation of top-level talks 
between the North and the South will be an important historic 
occasion for correctly setting the direction of our nation. 
  Delegates from the South side, the authority of top-level 
leaders of the two sides and the destiny of the nation are 
entrusted to North-South top-level talks, and the interest of 
the world is focused on these talks. 
  The North-South top-level talks should become, at any cost, 
successful talks which achieve national reconciliation and unity 
of all of the countrymen and which give a bright hope for the 
country's peace and for its independent and peaceful 
reunification. We have consistently adhered to the position of 
marking the turning point for the start towards realization of 
the country's reunification through top-level talks without 
outside forces' interference. 
  As your side knows, the respected and beloved President Kim 
Il- song personally initiated top-level talks as early as May 
1972, when North-South dialogue first began, and since then, has 
paid special attention to seeing to it that top-level talks, 
which will be of significance for the country's reunification, 
are held. 
  Our proposal for the exchange of special envoys in May last 
year was also part of our efforts for top-level talks. However, 
these efforts failed to bear due fruit. 
  It is indeed fortunate that the top-level talks which failed 
to be realized for the scores of years in the past have come to 
witness their rays for the first time today, 50 years since the 
country was divided. We think that precisely in this foundation 
lies our common position of worrying over the nation's today and 
tomorrow. We would like to believe that this position is 
precisely a manifestation of the independent spirit of shaping 
the nation's destiny with our Korean people's own strength. 
  If there are no differences in this national independent 
spirit between the North and the South, we can say that success 
of top- level talks has been guaranteed, because the top-level 
talks' ideal of linking the North and the South into one body is 
based precisely on our national, independent spirit, the source 
of our nation's will and strength to shape our destiny with our 
own strength, and the firm guarantee for defending the nation's 
common interests without falling prey to outside forces 
victimizing our nation's interests. 
  If the two sides start with this independent spirit and the 
nation's position, the North and the South will be able to 
achieve reconciliation and unity; easily transcend all 
differences in accordance with the principles of independence, 
peaceful reunification, and great national unity; overcome the 
difficult situation with the nation's united, national 
independent strength; and, thus, stand on the peak of 
reunification and prosperity which all fellow countrymen desire. 
  The North-South top-level talks that we are now going to 
have, will become the creation of a great new national history 
where the the history of antagonism that continued for half a 
century in our country changes into a history of great national 
unity; the history of confrontation becomes a history of peace; 
and the history of division becomes a history of reunification. 
It will undoubtedly give our 70 million fellow countrymen 
bright hope for reunification in the nineties and will also 
regain the great pride of our nation which has outstanding 
history, tradition, and wisdom. 
  This will also give great happiness to the world's 
peace-loving people who are worried about the situation on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  While frankly stating our basic views on the pressing 
top-level talks between the North and South, and emphasizing the 
important responsibility of both sides for the successful 
preparation of the historic top-level talks between the North 
and South, I will now put forth our proposal on the basic issues 
to be discussed at the preliminary contact. 
  First is the issue of the venue of the top-level talks. We 
propose that the venue of the top-level talks be held in 
Pyongyang. As your side knows, when President Kim Yong-sam was 
in the opposition party, the respected and beloved President Kim 
Il-song had already asked him to visit Pyongyang, and President 
Kim Yong-sam had repeatedly expressed the will that he will meet 
with President Kim Il-song, irrespective of the venue, and that 
he will visit Pyongyang. We believe that setting Pyongyang as 
the venue coincides with the will of the top-level of both sides. 
  Second is the issue of the date of the top-level talks. We 
propose to hold the top-level talks in mid-August. We believe 
that this date is significant because it is right about the day 
when the North and South all celebrate 15 August. 
  Third is the issue of the working-level procedure for the 
top- level talks between the North and South. We must discuss 
various working-level procedural issues for holding the 
top-level talks. We believe that except for important issues 
such as the venue and date, it is rational to provide a 
delegates' contact right after today's contact ends with one 
delegate from the preliminary contact of each side and two suite 
members of each side to discuss the other working-level issues. 
The delegates' contact should start from 1 July, and should be 
able to discuss issues such as the organization and scope of the 
delegation, schedule of sojourn, dispatch of advance team, 
procedures for exchange of visits, guarantee of accommodations, 
guaranteeing personal safety, and other working- level issues. 
  Fourth is the issue of creating an atmosphere for holding 
the 
top-level talks. If the talks are to be successful so that the 
top- levels of the North and South can meet, we believe that it 
is important for both sides to create a good atmosphere. Thus, 
we propose that from 1 July both sides completely stop all acts 
that may cloud the atmosphere for the top-level talks. 
  As such, while putting forth our proposal regarding the 
holding of the top-level talks between the North and South, we 
propose that an agreement on the preliminary contact for the 
top-level talks between the North and South be adopted along 
these lines so that it can be announced today.

  [Text] A preliminary contact for the South-North summit 
talks began at the Freedom House in our side's area at Panmunjom 
at 10:00 [0100 GMT] on 28 June. 
  Attending today's contact are Yi Hong-ku, head delegate from 
our side, and delegates Chong Chong-uk and Yun Yo-chun; and Kim 
Yong- sun, head delegate from the North's side, and delegates An 
Pyong-su and Paek Nam-chun. 
  At today's contact, head delegates from both sides will 
exchange greetings; delegates will exchange greetings; and Yi 
Hong-ku, our side's head delegate, will be the first to deliver 
a speech, followed by a speech by Kim Yong-sun, the North side's 
head delegate. They will begin the discussion on the time and 
venue of the summit talks. 
  Through his speech, our side's head delegate Yi Hong-ku will 
attach importance to the South-North summit talks and will 
present, in advance, a draft of an agreement proposing a 
concrete time, venue, protocol procedure, and itinerary for the 
summit talks. 
  It has been learned the draft proposes that the date of the 
summit talks be mid-July and that President Kim Il-song visit 
Seoul first. 
  This notwithstanding, as for the date of the summit talks, 
if 
the North side makes concessions to our side by not presenting 
the date of 15 August--when the pannational rally will be 
convened--our side will push for the dialogue by making 
concessions on the venue for the summit talks. 
  At the Secretariat for the South-North Dialogue this 
morning, 
our side's delegates gave a final study of our side's position 
and the North side's expected proposals. 
  Prior to departure, head delegate Yi Hong-ku said: I view 
the prospects for today's preliminary contact as somewhat 
affirmative in view of the North side's attitude up until now.

  [Excerpt] This is a report from a special KBS team filing 
from Panmunjom: 
  A preliminary contact for the realization of the South-North 
summit talks began at Panmunjom at 10:00 [01:00 GMT] on 28 June. 
  In his first speech at today's contact, Yi Hong-ku, our 
side's head delegate, proposed that both sides abide by the 
principle of reciprocity for exchanging visits between South and 
North Korea and proposed mid-July as the time for the summit 
talks. 
  Our side also proposed that to ensure efficient talks, the 
summit talks be exclusive talks between the heads of states 
[chongsang] from both sides. 
  Head delegate Yi Hong-ku also stated: I hope that the South- 
North summit talks will be realized at an early date, thereby 
helping to ease the heightened tension and solve all issues 
pending between the South and North. I believe that the talks 
will provide a historic momentum to open the door to national 
unification. 
  Head delegate Yi Hong-ku also pointed out: The meeting 
between the heads of state in the South and North carries 
enormous significance in itself, and can serve as a departure to 
restore the homogeneous nature of the national community. I 
hope that today's contact will proceed smoothly on the basis of 
the principle of mutual respect. [passage omitted covered by

  [Text] Panmunjom, June 28 (YONHAP) -- A burst of camera 
flashes greeted the North Korean delegation to Tuesday's 
inter-Korean summit preliminary contact on the Southern side of 
the truce village. 
  Chief delegate Kim Yong-sun and his team of An Pyong-su and 
Paek Nam-chun arrived at Peace House [Tongilgak] from the 
Northern side three minutes before the meeting hour in sedans 
provided by Seoul. 
  South Korea's chief delegate, Deputy Premier Yi Hong-ku, 
wearing a tight smile, came down the stairs from the second 
floor waiting room to welcome the North Korean team. 
  "Just call me Kim Yong-sun," the North Korean team leader 
said, raising a round of laughter. "Then just call me Yi 
Hong-ku," the Southern delegate replied. 
  Kim and Yi waved at reporters and cameramen before ascending 
to the conference room on the second floor. 
  -- Both sides opened the conference with boasts about who 
had 
built the better road to Panmunjom, apparently intended to 
demonstrate who is more fit to host the summit. 
  "It was only a two-hour drive from Pyongyang to here, and 
the 
scenery was just fabulous with clean homes and ripe crops," Kim 
Yong-sun said. "I thought it would be nice if you could travel 
the same road." 
  Yi Hong-ku, not about to lose out, said it had taken him 
only 
one hour to travel from his office to the truce village. 
  "The highway was recently widened to eight lanes," he 
explained. "I thought it would be nice if the highway was 
connected with the Northern side." 
  -- North Korean reporters and delegation assistants arrived 
earlier, crossing the demarcation line on foot. 
  About 25 reporters came, more than double the usual 10 seen 
at past contacts, reflecting the degree of interest in the 
outcome. 
  They avoided a flurry of questions from their South Korean 
counterparts, advising patience in response to queries about 
Pyongyang's proposal on the date and site of the summit. 
  One question touched a raw nerve: "Nonsense," one North 
Korean snapped when asked if Kim Yong-sun was related to 
President Kim Il-song. 
  Rumor has it that the chief North Korean delegate, an 
influential figure within the inner circle of power, is related 
by blood to the "great leader." 
  -- North Korea's free trade zones came up when Yi Hong-ku 
mentioned the subject. 
  "I received many phone calls telling me to find out about 
the 
free trade zones in Najin and Sonbong," he told North Korea's 
Kim. 
  Kim said he, too, had received many calls asking about the 
zones but withheld any new disclosures, simply saying "Let's 
just wait for the results." 
  --Tuesday's conference continued in three different forms as 
the two sides tried various ways to reach an agreement. 
  Seoul's delegates asked for a 10-minute break at 11:30 AM 
when the morning session appeared to be a fruitless exercise. 
  The meeting was then convened between only the chief 
delegates before breaking up again at 1 PM. 
  They were in virtual agreement on holding the first summit 
in 
Pyongyang on July 25, but North Korean officials objected to 
Seoul's condition that the summit be arranged through exchange 
visits between the two sides to guarantee reciprocity. 
  The North Koreans instead made a new demand during the 
morning session, asking that a clause be inserted in the 
agreement that neither side could take any provocative actions 
that might cancel the summit talks. 
  They parted for lunch with a promise to meet again 
afterwards. An Pyong-su returned by himself around 2:30 PM and 
met separately with Yun Ye-chun to go over the minutes of the 
morning session. 
  -- Security officials were unusually strict toward 
reporters, 
blocking the staircase to the conference room and placing 
security agents on site. 
  One official explained the extreme caution was needed to 
prevent repetition of past incidents where press coverage placed 
too much emphasis on differences of opinion between the two 
sides and influenced the inter-Korean talks in a negative way. 
  Nevertheless, the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) had 
presidential instructions and permission to provide thorough 
coverage of the conference. 
  President Kim Yong-sam is said to have specially requested 
the state-invested TV network to cover the conference live [for 
broadcast on closed-circuit television] so that he could watch 
it from his office. 
  -- The Panmunjom preparatory contact was telecast live to 
the 
top leaders of South and North Korea who, based on their viewing 
of it, handed down instructions to their negotiators at 
Panmunjom from time to time. 
  In an advance agreement, a 20-member KBS Television crew 
covered the conference in its entirety for beaming to both sides. 
  Conference scenes caught by television cameras were sent to 
Tongilgak in the Northern sector of Panmunjom by an optical 
cable connecting the two areas of the joint security area via a 
relay van outside the peace house. 
  At Tongilgak, the television picture of the South's NTSC 
scanning method was converted to the North's PAL method before 
being beamed directly to Kim Il-song's Palace in Pyongyang. 
  Instructions from the two presidents were promptly conveyed 
over telephone to respective liaison officials at Panmunjom, 
which were handed to the chief negotiators in notes. 
  An official who was present at the conference said white 
pieces of paper were relayed to North Korea's chief delegate Kim 
Yong-sun at several minutes' interval around 11 AM when the two 
sides did not back down from their respective ideas. 
  Shortly after the delivery of the memos, Kim Yong-sun backed 
down and tentatively agreed to the South's idea of holding a 
summit on July 25, the official said.

<F P=106> ["News conference" by Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister for </F>
national unification, with unidentified reporters on 28 June; 
place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Deputy Prime Minister Yi] Today the North and South 
held a preliminary contact in Panmunjom for holding their summit 
talks. After 10 hours of negotiations, both sides have reached 
an agreement. The main contents of the agreement are as 
follows: The North and South agree to hold their summit talks 
in Pyongyang from 25 to 27 July, and the next summit talks will 
be decided during the meeting of the top leaders of the two 
sides in Pyongyang. 
  We need various preparations -- such as honor guard and 
secret service issues -- to hold the summit talks, but these 
working-level matters will be discussed during the working-level 
contact between the North and South which is scheduled to be 
held at Tongilgak in the North side's area of Panmunjom on 1 
July. One delegate and two associates [suhaengwon] from each 
side will decide on the matters after their discussions. 
Finally, the two sides agreed that they would make joint 
efforts to create a good atmosphere for the success of the 
North-South summit talks. The contents of the agreement are 
comparatively concise, but it is clear that they have reflected 
the firm will of the leaders of the two sides to make an 
important political decision and to create a new phase on the 
Korean peninsula, judging from various events that have taken 
place on the Korean peninsula -- such as the heightening of 
tensions on the Korean peninsula -- or from the long history of 
national division. 
  Although the negotiations lasted a long time, the two sides 
made endless efforts, with their patience, to reach such an 
agreement. Therefore, I believe North-South relations will 
literally enter a new phase when the previously mentioned 
preparations proceed well in the future. 
  [Reporter] What was the most difficult matter of discussion 
in reaching the agreement? 
  [Deputy Prime Minister Yi] Of course, we wanted to hold the 
North-South summit talks in Seoul. The North side demanded from 
the beginning, however, that it hold the summit talks in 
Pyongyang. At the same time, it has expressed the will to hold 
it on the occasion of the 15 August event [1945 liberation from 
Japan]. Such positions by the North side have run counter to 
our side. Therefore, we had many difficulties coordinating each 
other's position during the contact. 
  [Reporter] Before you took part in the contact, you said 
that 
the place for the summit talks had been proposed based on the 
principle of reciprocity. Then, will the next summit talks 
satisfy the principle of reciprocity based on the will of the 
leaders of the two sides? What is your judgment? 
  [Yi] North-South talks have been held on many occasions in 
various fields and levels. However, in general, we have 
observed the principle of reciprocity. Therefore, we have 
proposed it this time as our principle. It is the position of 
the North side that both sides do not need to stick to past 
events, because it seems to believe that the time has come to 
hold summit talks between the leaders of the two sides, and the 
summit talks are different from the North-South talks which were 
held in the past.

  [Text] Seoul, June 28 (YONHAP) -- Both the ruling and 
opposition parties on Tuesday welcomed the inter-Korean 
agreement on the schedule of the first South-North summit 
meeting since the nation was divided five decades ago. Pak 
Pom-chin, spokesman for the Democratic Liberal Party, said in a 
statement, "together with the people, we welcome the agreement 
to hold a South-North summit meeting for the first time after 
national division." 
  The ruling party expressed the wish that the summit will 
succeed so as to put an end to enmity and confrontation between 
the two Koreas and unfold a new age of peaceful coexistence and 
mutual cooperation on the Korean peninsula. 
  The opposition Democratic Party said it expects the summit 
meeting would have good results without fail. "It is the 
dictate of the history for us to overcome any obstacles ahead 
with national dignity," party spokesman Pak Chi-won said. 
  The party expressed the hope that the government will fully 
prepare for the summit meeting, sampling public opinions broadly 
on the upcoming summit.

<F P=106> [By Yu Yong-ku] </F>
  [Text] With the 28 June preliminary contact for South-North 
summit talks and the 8-11 July North Korean-U.S. high-level 
talks just ahead, the North Korean authorities' remarks 
slandering the South and the United States have diminished. 
However, North Korea continues to denounce South Korea and the 
United States through its media and broadcast from the truce 
line to the South. This makes people wonder about North Korea's 
real intention. 
  North Korea's domestic Central Broadcasting Network and 
Pyongyang Radio to South Korea recently carried commentaries 
berating the United States for aggravating tensions and 
denouncing the ROK for preparing for a war, citing the U.S. 
Forces' moves on and around the Korean peninsula and U.S. 
officials' remarks on the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  The North Korean broadcasting services stress each day that 
the situation on the Korean peninsula is "on the brink of war," 
denounce the United States for preparing "the second Korean 
war," regard the ROK's strengthening of its alert posture as a 
"war maneuver for a northward invasion," and do not hesitate in 
making such unsparing words as "war to war" and "South Korea 
will not be safe, either." 
  With important talks ahead, it is hard for us to understand 
a 
North Korea that continues to denounce its counterparts. 
However, we do not have to pay serious attention to this since 
such North Korean attitudes are not new. 
  North Korea has never stopped slandering, not even during 
South-North high-level talks, working-level contacts for an 
exchange of envoys, or North Korean-U.S. high-level talks. 
  This is aimed at having an advantage in negotiations. That 
is, by continuously expressing its strong position, North Korea 
intends to have its counterparts make concessions. This is also 
aimed at preparing to cope with a possible worse situation in 
the contacts with South Korea and the United States. North 
Korea believes that, in order to safeguard its system, it should 
prevent the people's ideological stir even if the outside 
situation changes somewhat. 
  In light of the fact that the North Korean people are all 
the 
more urged to unite around Kim Chong-il on the occasion of the 
anniversary of the Korean war, it seems that North Korea's 
denunciation of South Korea and the United States has an 
internal political purpose to strengthen Kim's position. 
  This is proved by Pyongyang's radio special talk on 22 June 
that stressed, "Let us overwhelm the enemy in the serious 
political and military confrontation without gunfire and firmly 
defend the national sovereignty by upholding General Kim 
Chong-il." 
  As they announced the resumption of North Korean-U.S. 
high-level talks following North Korea's withdrawal from the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a victory of Supreme 
Commander Kim Chong-il's determination, the North Korean media 
are probably preparing to attribute any successful result of the 
upcoming dialogue with South Korea and the United States to 
North Korea's intransigence under international pressure to 
defend its sovereignty.

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Ki-pong] </F>
  [Text] Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] leader Kim Chong-pil 
said: "Kim Il-song who made 2.3 million compatriots fall victim 
to his invasion 44 years ago still has the ambition to reunify 
the country by armed force." He then stressed: "The object of 
Kim Il-song's nuclear attack is South Korea where his fellow 
countrymen live, not the United States or Japan." He is warning 
against "war criminal" Kim Il-song every day. He said the above 
in a training for members of the Yongwol-Pyongchang, Chongson, 
and Taebaek district party chapters held at Yongwol County 
Cultural Center on 24 June. During field education programs for 
party members in Andong, North Kyongsang Province on 22 June and 
at the Veterans Association office in Seoul on 21 June, Kim 
warned: "We must not let down our guard against North Korea 
since no one knows what Kim Il-song will do." 
  DLP leader Kim Chong-pil is the only person who strongly 
denounces President Kim Il-song every day at a time when 
people's expectation of the South-North summit is ever 
increasing as the summit has been promoted. 
  There are different analyses of the reason why Kim is 
frequently making remarks running counter to the trend of the 
time. 
  Some people view that this is an expression of disputes 
inside the ruling party over the party line. Some view that his 
remarks represent conservatives stressing that one should not 
meet face-to- face with Kim Il-song with such an idea as 
expressed in President Kim Yong-sam's inauguration statement 
noting "any allied country is not better than the nation." 
  Some view that criticism of Kim Il-song is a portion 
allotted 
to Kim Chong-pil. 
  Those close to Kim Chong-pil explained: "He is making such 
remarks to warn the people against their conviction that the 
South- North summit will immediately be followed by 
reunification." 
  Many other people view that Kim's criticism of North Korea 
and his alerting the people against it are linked with his 
political position. That is, they think Kim is trying to take 
this opportunity to secure his position as the leader of 
conservatives. 
  Some people note that Kim's remark against Kim Tae-chung, 
president of the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, that "if there 
is a person who stated that it does not matter if North Korea 
possesses one or two nuclear weapons, he or she is not a person 
living in this land" was aimed at driving the political 
situation to a progressives-versus-conservatives structure. 
  People are interested in how far his moves will go after 
breaking his silence while presenting himself as a "housewife" 
since the inauguration of the civilian government.

  [Text] Seoul, June 28 (YONHAP) -- Nuclear Ambassador Kim 
Sam-hun said Tuesday that Seoul and Washington have not changed 
their positions one iota on seeking a thorough and broad 
solution to the North Korean nuclear dispute. 
  Meeting reporters just a day before departing for Washington 
to meet with American officials on the upcoming U.S.-North Korea 
talks in Geneva, Kim said the focus would be on persuading 
Pyongyang to guarantee the transparency of its past, present and 
future nuclear activities. 
  Asked about the U.S.-North Korea talks in Geneva, Kim 
replied 
that "we should closely watch how the discussions proceed." He 
added that inspection of the historical records of North Korea's 
nuclear program and U.S. aid for its installation of light-water 
reactors would be top issues. 
  On the historical records of North Korea's nuclear 
development program, he stressed that the communist state must 
reveal the amount of plutonium extracted from spent fuel rods in 
the past and allow UN inspections of two undeclared sites at 
Yongbyon and the spent fuel rods taken recently from a 
5-megawatt experimental reactor, as well as permit the 
application of improved inspection technology by UN experts. 
  "If the inter-Korean summit proceeds so well that the Korean 
peninsula denuclearization declaration and mutual nuclear 
inspections between South and North Korea become positive issues 
of discussion, the summit will have a positive influence on the 
upcoming U.S.-North Korea talks," he observed. 
  Speaking of the Washington-Pyongyang talks in Geneva, Kim 
said, "North Korea will host on July 8 and the United States the 
following day. After a break on Sunday (July 10) to receive 
instructions from their respective home governments, they will 
sit down again on July 11." 
  While in Washington, Kim will meet the chief American 
delegate to the Geneva meeting, Robert Gallucci, and Asian 
Affairs Bureau Director Yutaka Kawashima of Japan's Foreign 
Ministry, who is also visiting the U.S. capital to discuss the 
nuclear dispute with North Korea. 
  Kim will return home on July 4.

  [Text] Moscow, June 28 (YONHAP) -- A senior North Korean 
official admitted that his country possesses plutonium for 
research purposes at a radiochemical laboratory in the Yongbyon 
nuclear complex, ITAR-TASS News Agency reported from Pyongyang 
on Monday. 
  In an interview with the Russian news agency, the North 
Korean director general of the Atomic Energy Industry Ministry 
overseas affairs bureau, Choe Chong-sun, acknowledged that some 
plutonium was at the complex but did not elaborate on the total 
amount. 
  Choe is the first top North Korean official to admit to his 
country's possession of plutonium. He reportedly said that 
despite Pyongyang's withdrawal from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), the agency's monitoring equipment at 
Yongbyon is operating normally and stressed that North Korea 
will inform the IAEA if the equipment needs replacement. 
  As to cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog, Choe said 
North Korea has no specific expectations "at present as well as 
in the past," disclosing that only 500,000 U.S. dollars was 
provided by the agency last year for agricultural and medical 
purposes. 
  The basic purpose of the Yongbyon nuclear reactor, 
constructed through close cooperation with Russia, is to secure 
the nuclear power generation necessary to develop the country's 
economy, he asserted. The existing 5-megawatt reactor is 
insufficient to meet domestic demand. 
  Although the former Soviet Union provided key assistance in 
building the reactor, he continued, North Korea does not hold 
out much hope that its successor Russia will do the same. He 
maintained that "there is almost no cooperation with Russia 
presently in the nuclear field."

  [Text] Hong Kong, June 28 (YONHAP) -- "Border trade" 
between North Korea and China took its steepest dive ever in the 
first five months of this year due to the North's nuclear issue 
and economic difficulties, the SING TAO WAN PAO reported Tuesday. 
  The evening newspaper reported from China's Jilin Province 
that border trade between Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture 
and North Korea, mostly barter trade, came to only 80,440 U.S. 
dollars in January-May, nosediving 46.1 percent from the same 
period last year. 
  The volume is only 15.5 percent of this year's goal, the 
paper quoted Kim Chong-su, chairman of the prefecture's Foreign 
Economic Relations and Trade Commission, as saying. 
  Yanbian's exports to North Korea amounted to 22.59 million 
dollars in the cited period, down 72.4 percent from the same 
months last year and reaching only 8.7 percent of this year's 
goal. 
  The paper attributed the unprecedented decrease in border 
trade to global economic pressure on Pyongyang caused by the 
controversy over its nuclear program, North Korea's shortage of 
commodities and energy, poor crops and nonfulfillment of trade 
contacts. 
  The paper said Beijing has been studying ways to prevent 
possible unease along the Chinese-North Korean border, noting 
that economic pressure by the international community could 
create problems.

<F P=106> [By reporter Kang Tae-ho] </F>
  [Text] North Korean-Japanese negotiations on establishing 
diplomatic relations that have been suspended since the eighth 
round of their negotiations in November 1992, are likely to 
resume, and this is attracting public attention. 
  It was reported that "Japanese Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa 
asked U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher during talks on 
23 June, to urge North Korea to resume negotiations with Japan 
for establishing North Korean-Japanese diplomatic ties, and 
ordered the Foreign Ministry's working-level offices to begin 
preparations for negotiations with North Korea." This report 
seems to indicate that North Korea has not responded in any 
particular way to Japan's proposal for negotiations on 
establishing diplomatic ties, and that Japan is now asking the 
United States to take the role of a mediator. However, it is a 
more convincing analysis that North Korea and Japan are holding 
behind-the-scene contacts for resuming negotiations on 
establishing diplomatic ties under the situation in which 
South-North summit talks are being held while the third round of 
North Korean-U.S. talks are being promoted, and that the United 
States and Japan have discussed this issue. In particular, we 
need to take note of the fact that working-level offices of the 
Japanese Foreign Ministry's have set out preparatory work for 
negotiations with North Korea. 
  In early January, when North Korea and the United States 
announced their agreement on the third round of North 
Korean-U.S. talks and the nuclear inspection issue after a 
series of working-level contacts in New York, Japan announced 
that it had sounded out North Korea's intention to resume 
negotiations on establishing diplomatic ties between the two. 
Last year, the Japanese Government had decided to exclude the 
nuclear issue from the list of preconditions for resuming North 
Korean-Japanese talks. It seems that Japan sounded out the 
possibility of resuming negotiations for diplomatic ties with 
North Korea by sending the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] delegation, including Hajime Fukada of the House of 
Councillors, to Pyongyang late last year, right before making 
the above decision. Then, on 9 January, then-Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata officially expressed Japan's will to resume 
negotiations on establishing diplomatic ties with North Korea. 
  North Korea, however, reacted coldly to Japan's initiative. 
Noting Japan's ambition to become a "military power" and a 
"nuclear power," North Korea denounced Japan's "maneuver to 
isolate and ruin the Republic [konghwaguk korip malsal 
chaektong]" under the pretext of the nuclear issue. It 
continuously denounced remarks made by Hata, the Japanese 
Foreign Minister at the time, which pointed out the North Korean 
nuclear issue as a cause for misgivings in the entire Asian 
region, thus pouring cold water upon Japan's active attitude. 
Eventually, the Japanese proposal for resuming negotiations on 
diplomatic ties with North Korea could not be realized as the 
nuclear issue underwent vicissitudes at the brink of a worsened 
phase of sanctions. 
  At that time, insisting that North Korea ruptured the eighth 
round of negotiations, Japan voiced its policy that it would not 
hold negotiations on diplomatic ties unless North Korea first 
proposed a meeting. It is well worth recalling Japan's 
explanation about the background to the change in original 
policy that resulted in the proposal for negotiations to North 
Korea. A Japanese Foreign Ministry official explained that the 
Japanese proposal is "aimed at giving indirect aid to U.S.-North 
Korean negotiations over the nuclear issue." The following, 
however, cannot be disregarded: With the possibility of rapid 
improvement in South-North and North Korean-U.S. relations 
bringing Japan's isolation to the fore, Japan wants to secure 
the right to speak about issues on the Korean peninsula and 
nuclear issue. 
  From this viewpoint, a series of recent visits to North 
Korea by delegations of the SDPJ and the Liberal Democratic 
Party of Japan [LDPJ] lend support to the resumption of dialogue 
between North Korea and Japan. Their visits have been made on 
the basis of the background and logic similar to that seen in 
last January. In particular, the SDPJ delegation's visit to 
North Korea is noteworthy. The SDPJ played the role of a 
coordinator behind the scene in adopting a joint declaration by 
three Japanese political parties in September 1990 in which they 
agreed to the principle of an early establishment of diplomatic 
relations with North Korea. Furthermore, there have been 
negotiations regarding the SDPJ's participation in a new 
coalition cabinet since the Hata minority coalition cabinet 
resigned. This shows the high possibility that the SDPJ's ideas 
will be reflected in Japan's policy on North Korea. 
  According to the NAEWOE NEWS AGENCY, the SDPJ delegation 
headed by Director of the General Affairs Bureau Kazo Watanabe 
held talks with the Workers Party of Korea on 12 June and 
discussed the North Korean nuclear issue, Japan's policy toward 
North Korea, and ways to develop relations between the two 
countries. It is learned that in the talks, North Korea 
insisted that the Japanese authorities abandon its hostile 
policy against North Korea and cooperate in resolving pending 
issues in conformity with the spirit of the joint declaration 
issued in September 1990 by the three Japanese political 
parties. In particular, the SDPJ delegation met Kim Yong-sun, 
party secretary of North Korea who is known to be the person 
actually in charge of negotiations on diplomatic relations with 
Japan. An LDPJ delegation headed by Vice Secretary-General Taku 
Masaki visited North Korea on 14 June, although what was 
discussed in their talks has not been learned. Musuko Miki, 
wife of former Japanese Prime Minister Miki, also visited North 
Korea on the same day and held talks with President Kim Il-song. 
  Whether Japan officially proposed the resumption of 
negotiations on establishing diplomatic ties and how North Korea 
reacted to Japan's proposal, if it was made, will soon be 
learned. It is clear, however, that North Korea and Japan are 
headed for the thawing age. 
  It is proved by the confirmed fact, even if it was a minor 
move, that North Korea began to resume issuing visas to Japanese 
tourists on 21 June. North Korea suspended issuing visas to 
Japanese tourists in June 1993. The Chungoe Travel Agency, the 
general agent of the state-run Korea International Tourist 
Company of North Korea in Japan, said that it began to gather 
tourists in mid-May upon the notification on resuming visa 
issuance by North Korea. Prior to this, in early June, it was 
reported that Japan expressed its willingness to give economic 
aid to North Korea through international organizations even 
before the establishment of diplomatic relations under the 
precondition of a solution of the nuclear problem in a 
diplomatic way. Japan mentioned assistance in development of a 
light-water reactor, participation in the Tumen River 
development project, and emergency food aid as concrete methods 
of its economic aid to North Korea. Since it is hard for the 
Japanese Government to give direct aid to North Korea before 
establishing diplomatic ties with it, the Japanese Government is 
reportedly considering methods to support it by forming a 
consultation body for supporting North Korea with international 
organizations, such as the UN Development Plan and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], or related countries 
or organizations, such as Japan, the United States, the ROK, and 
the World Bank. 
  Experts say that while promoting sanctions on North Korea, 
the United States has certainly understood that sanctions cannot 
be imposed without active participation by China and Japan. 
This means that Japan plays a great role as North Korea's 
economic cooperation partner. They note Japan is now required 
to participate in efforts to resolve the nuclear issue through 
negotiations. They view that the discussions between Japanese 
Prime Minister Koji Kakizawa and U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher on resuming North Korean-Japanese dialogue under 
this situation were very significant.

  [Text] Thailand and South Korea agreed yesterday to expand 
economic cooperation between their countries and increase 
regional security ties. 
  The agreement was reached during a meeting between Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai and South Korean President Kim Young-sam. 
  The two leaders also discussed ways to ease tensions over 
North Korea's suspected diversion of plutonium to build nuclear 
weapons, officials said. 
  Prime Minister Chuan, who arrived Thursday for a four-day 
official visit wished President Kim success at the first-ever 
inter-Korean summit, which is currently being planned to help 
defuse the nuclear impasse. 
  Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, reaffirming Thailand's 
support of the non-nuclear proliferation treaty, said he hoped 
North and South Korea would be able to reach an accord on the 
issue through their talks. 
  He said Bangkok hoped that North Korea would return to the 
Non-nuclear Proliferation Treaty and the United Nations' 
Security Council would not resort to harsh measures against the 
nation to force it to comply with the treaty. 
  The United States is calling on the UN Security Council to 
impose economic sanctions against North Korea and Thailand, as a 
UN member, will have to comply with any resolution, he said. 
  The Foreign Ministry's Southeast Asian Department Chief Don 
Paramatwinai quoted President Kim as saying that the nuclear 
conflict between South and North Korea posed not only a threat 
to the Korean Peninsula but the entire world. 
  The South Korean President expressed hope that the June 28 
summit would be successful. 
  South Korea was prepared to negotiate with North Korea on 
mutual interest and world security issues, Mr Don quoted 
President Kim as saying. 
  Mr Kim asked that regulations be eased to allow more South 
Korean firms to invest in construction and communications 
projects in Thailand, while Prime Minister Chuan asked that 
South Korea import more Thai agricultural goods. 
  South Korea is Thailand's seventh largest trading partner, 
with two-way trade last year totaling US$1.94 billion, a 
two-fold increase over the past five years. 
  South Korea exported US$1.47 billion worth of goods to 
Thailand last year, mostly in machinery, oil, Iron, steel, and 
automobiles, while importing sugar, computer parts, tapioca and 
rubber from Thailand. 
  The two leaders also agreed to improve South Korea's 
relations with the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN) 
whose members include Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, 
Singapore, Indonesia and Brunei. 
  During the meeting, Mr Don said President Kim also agreed in 
principle to a Thai proposal that a joint commission be set up 
between the two countries to promote trade and economic 
cooperation. 
  No actual agreement has been signed on the proposal as both 
sides would need to discuss how the commission should be formed, 
he said. 
  Prime Minister Chuan also extended an invitation to the 
South 
Korean leader to visit Thailand.

<F P=106> [Report from Seoul by Correspondent of the Public Relations </F>
Department Somphon Kitphonprasoet] 
  [Text] Today Prime Minister Chuan Likphai attended a 
luncheon hosted by four Korean associations at the (Tibra) 
Hotel. The prime minister delivered a speech, during which he 
noted to Korean businessmen that relations between the two 
countries are now entering a new dimension, that of a joint 
investment, which will enhance stability and contribute to 
regional prosperity as a whole. The prime minister took note of 
the overwhelming success of South Korea in development of 
democratic administration, free trade and industries, and 
cultural progress, especially in sports. He said that ROK 
achievements serve as a model to all developing countries. 
  The prime minister said that Thailand should not simply be a 
market for Korean industry but should serve as a gateway for 
joint investment ventures, which will certainly benefit South 
Korea. He noted that the labor in Thailand is skilled labor, 
and Thailand also boasts high financial stability. The value of 
the baht is strong, and Thailand has the lowest rate of 
inflation in Asia. He said South Korea should take advantage of 
those favorable aspects of Thailand to expand trade and industry 
to step ahead into Burma and other Indochinese countries in the 
future.

  [Text] Korea will be stripped of its European tariff 
reduction favor on textile products, during the latter half of 
this year, and will see more cuts in items subject to the 
generalized system of preferences (GSP), starting next year, the 
Korea Foreign Trade Association (KFTA) said yesterday. 
  The KFTA said that the European Union's (EU) board of 
directors have recently agreed that they will suspend the GSP 
favor for Korea's textile products under the multi-fiber 
agreement (MFA), starting July 1. 
  The withdrawal of the GSP favor is apparently in retaliation 
for Korea's imposition of higher tariff on European wool 
products, a KFTA official said. 
  Korea exported $57,233,000 worth of textile products under 
the GSP in 1992, representing 16.5 percent of GSP-Favored 
exports to the EU and 3.37 percent of total exports. 
  The official said that the EU plans to draw up a law on its 
new GSP system to be applied during the 1995-2005. The law 
draft will be presented to the EU's Executive Commission in July 
for finalization by the end of this year. He said, quoting a 
report from KFTA's branch in Brussels. 
  Korea will remain beneficiary of the EU's new GSP but the 
items and volumes benefiting from the GSP will sharply decline, 
he said, adding that this assumption is based on reports 
circulated so far. 
  Korea has been given GSP favor by the EU since 1971, except 
for 1988-91 when the favor was suspended due to bilateral 
disputes over the protection of European intellectual property 
rights. The EU has also used the GSP as a leverage in trade 
negotiations with Korea on several other items, including 
automobiles. 
  Korea ha sold 20.8 percent of its total exports to the EU 
under the tariff rate reduction. 
  General industrial products, including automobiles, and 
textiles represented 96.1 percent of total GSP-favored exports 
but the major export items of automobiles, electronics goods and 
textile products have received reduced favored due to the EU's 
protectionist measures, the KFTA official said. 
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong's exports to the EU under the GSP were 
9.3 percent in 1992, and those of Mexico 21.8 percent. China 
saw 39.3 percent and members of the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations (ASEAN) 34.8 percent.

  [Text] Seoul, June 26 (YONHAP) -- The four-day-old strike 
by railroad and subway workers entered a new phase Sunday as 
police launched a pre-dawn raid on two Seoul universities to 
disperse thousands of striking workers and round up more than 80 
of them. 
  Over 5,000 police forces broke into Kyung Hee University in 
northeastern Seoul around 5 A.M. Sunday to scatter about 1,800 
striking railroad and subway workers and sympathizing students 
and arrest key striking members. 
  Most of the workers and students who had been staging a 
sit-in at Kyung Hee University against the government's 
hard-line policy on railroad and subway labor disputes fled the 
Kyung Hee campus just before the police raid. 
  Some of the students and workers resisted strongly to the 
police raid hurling hundreds of firebombs and wielding steel 
pipes for about 20 minutes before running away to Dongduck 
Women's University where their colleagues fled. 
  Police then raided Dongduck Women's University again around 
6:30 A.M. to apprehend 62 unionized workers and 23 students and 
to forcibly disperse others. The operation lasted about 20 
minutes. 
  Informed about the imminent police raid, most of the workers 
and students had escaped Kyung Hee University around 4 A.M. and 
about 800 of them gathered at Dongduck Women's University later. 
  Police, in the meantime, secured arrest warrants for 12 
leading striking workers including Kim In-hwan, head of the 
labor union of Seoul Metropolitan Subway Corp. (SMSC) and So 
Son-won, chairman of the unauthorized unionized group of train 
engineers and mechanics "Chongihyop" for their suspected 
violations of labor dispute laws and obstruction of official 
duties, according to a police spokesman. 
  Police said in a statement that it was forced to mobilize 
the 
police forces to arrest the SMSC union leader Kim In-hwan and 
four other core members in the strike and to soon reinstate 
those who want to return to their works so that the crippled 
subway and railroad operations could be normalized. 
  Police accused the striking workers of violating labor 
dispute laws because they embarked on a general strike last 
Friday despite the fact that the laws prevent unionists from 
staging a strike or any form of collective actions within 15 
days from the central labor committee announced the cooling-off 
period for mediation. The committee had issued the 15-day 
cooling-off period last Wednesday. 
  Police, meanwhile, decided not to break into Myongdong 
Cathedral in downtown Seoul, the largest opposition Democratic 
Party (DP) headquarters in Yoido and a Seoul church hall where 
striking railroad and subway workers are staging sit-ins, taking 
into consideration the status of the venues as religious and 
politically sensitive ones, according to the police spokesman. 
  The SMSC unionists have been staging a general strike since 
Friday, three days earlier than they originally set for the 
strike in protest against the police raid last Thursday on the 
place where Chongihyop members were staging a sit-in. Since 
then they have occupied the DP headquarters, Myongdong 
Cathedral, and a few other religious and academic institutions 
to stage sit-ins. 
  The SMSC has so far filed a complaint with the prosecution 
against 41 leading union members for their alleged labor dispute 
law violations and relieved 24 union leaders of their posts in 
connection with the ongoing strike. 
  In the meantime, 3,647 workers or 55.7 percent of the total 
railroad workers reported to work by 10 a.m. Sunday, the 
deadline set by the Korean National Railroad (KNR), arousing 
hopes that the operation of railroad could be put to a normal 
condition sooner or later. 
  The KNR said that it expected part of the railroad services 
in Seoul and its vicinity to be normalized starting Monday, 
adding it was still accepting intentions by striking workers to 
return to their works although the initial deadline expired 
Sunday morning. 
  Only 36.7 percent or 3,204 workers of the total Seoul subway 
workers, however, reported to work as of Sunday morning, 
thwarting hopes to resume normal subway operations as early as 
possible, according to the SMSC. 
  In particular, only 5.0 percent or 46 of the total 920 
locomotive engineers returned to their works and just two 
percent of the total conductors reported to work. 
  To help normalize the railroad operation, the Ministry of 
Defense decided to provide the KNR with 350 additional 350 
military personnel who are capable of assisting in the operation 
of locomotives, according to a Defense Ministry spokesman. 
  The Ministry of Defense also said that it will soon put into 
service 270 military locomotives in Seoul and Pusan to ease 
traffic congestion stemming from the railroad workers strike. 
  Last Thursday, the Defense Ministry had sent 64 soldiers 
capable of operating locomotives to the Transportation Ministry.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Yi Sung--yol] </F>
  [Text] To the relief of government and business circles, 
the planned nationwide strike in sympathy with striking train 
engineers and subway workers did not take place yesterday. 
  The National Council of Union Representatives (NCUR), a 
hard-line labor alliance, announced last week that major unions 
of larger business firms would go on "sympathy strike" beginning 
yesterday. But most of the unions didn't obey, apparently 
because of the popular outrage against the "reckless strike" of 
train engineers and subway workers. 
  The prosecution has warned that any sympathy strikes would 
be 
illegal and said it would sternly deal with the unionists 
involved. 
  The two key unions of Hyundai Heavy Industries in Ulsan and 
Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery in Koje Island, both in 
South Kyongsang Province whose action would have considerable 
impact on any future labor disputes, virtually ignored the 
NCUR's announcement. Train engineers across the nation went on 
strike last Thursday calling for pay raises and protesting the 
arrest of their colleagues who had staged a sit-in. The NCUR 
late last week declared a nationwide sympathy strike to begin 
from yesterday. 
  The Daewoo union announced it would not participate in the 
planned sympathy strike, while Hyundai unionists went on a 
five-hour strike during which they held rally condemning 
Sunday's police action against train engineers. 
  A Daewoo union spokesman said that collective bargaining was 
under way and added the union will make an independent decision 
whether or not to go on strike regardless of the NCUR's 
announcement. He said a strike ballot is scheduled for tomorrow. 
  Daewoo union leaders attempted a three-hour strike last 
Tuesday but only 450 of the 8,300 unionists participated. 
  Above all, the negative public opinions on the ongoing of 
train and subway workers' strikes might have discouraged Daewoo 
and other union leaders from joining the sympathy strike, said 
an official at the Labor Ministry. 
  Kia Motors and Daewoo Motors, whose unions have taken a 
hard-line attitude in the past, also boycotted the sympathy 
strike. 
  Unionists at Hyundai Heavy Industries, however, decided to 
go 
on strike tomorrow. 
  As of yesterday, only seven unions were on strike, including 
train engineers, Seoul and Pusan subway workers, unionists at 
Kumbo &amp; Co., Daedong Industrial Co. and Paek Hospital in 
Pusan. 
  Workers at other major industrial sites in Ulsan, Chongwon, 
Masan in South Kyongsang Province and in Kwangju in South Cholla 
Province showed no signs of joining the sympathy strike. 
  Later in the day, Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok presided over a 
meeting of labor-related ministers and instructed them to 
mobilize all administrative power to fill the vacancies caused 
by striking train and subway engineers. 
  Yi also called for the arrest of union leaders who 
masterminded illegal strikes. 
  Meanwhile, the prosecution warned that riot police will 
enter 
business firms if unionists go on strike illegally to disperse 
them and arrest leading unionists. 
  The prosecution is also searching for Yang Kyu-hon, chairman 
of the NCUR, and Secretary-General Mun Song-hyon for their 
alleged role in inciting the illegal strike. 
  A prosecution spokesman said that riot police will soon 
storm 
several work places, where illegal strikes are under way. 
  At the same time, the Labor Ministry will try and persuade 
unionists in other firms to settle ongoing disputes without 
going on strike to prevent the proliferation of strikes, a 
ministry spokesman said.

  [Text] Seoul, June 28 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul subway workers' 
strike continued for the fifth straight day Tuesday with the 
fatigue felt by non-striking workers, after working overtime for 
the past four days, causing a reduction in operating hours and 
leaving many commuters stranded during the morning rush hours. 
  On lines two and three, operating hours were cut with trains 
running from 6:00 A.M. to 10:00 P.M., instead of from 5:00 A.M. 
to 12:00 P.M. Moreover, intervals between train runs were 
extended from three minutes to six minutes, causing traffic 
congestion at nearly all stops during the morning rush hours. 
  At Sadang station, a transfer point for lines two and four, 
some 300 stranded passengers delayed a train's departure by 
about 15 minutes at 8:40 in the morning. 
  However, on lines one and four, which are linked with the 
national railroads, the intervals were back to the near-normal 
three to four minutes, as national railway operations were 
nearly normalized with striking train engineers returning to 
work. 
  As of 8:00 A.M. Tuesday, 3,823 or 44 percent of the 8,724 
striking subway workers had returned to work, according to the 
Seoul Metropolitan Subway Corp. 
  Consequently, the corporation extended the deadline for 
returning to work to 4:00 P.M. Tuesday from 11:00 A.M. Saturday. 
  As a result, whether subway operations are normalized within 
the week depends on how many more striking workers return to 
their posts by the new deadline. 
  Corporation officials said the number of strikers returning 
by the extended deadline would determine whether lines two and 
three could resume normal operations within the week. 
  Meanwhile, railroad operations are rapidly returning to 
normal as more than 90 percent of striking workers have returned 
to work. 
  The Korean National Railroad (KNR) said Tuesday that freight 
train operations, including those for containers, oil and 
cement, had reached normalcy, with cargo train runs increasing 
to the pre-strike level of 543 a day across the country. 
  Commuter train operations on major lines also achieved 90 
percent normalcy, while passenger train runs on trunk lines such 
as Seoul-Pusan, Taejon-Mokpo and Iri-Sunchon increased by 15 
from Monday to 82, 18 percent of the normal level. 
  Passenger and cargo train runs totaled 1,444 across the 
country for the day, more than 70 percent of the pre-strike 
level, the KNR said. 
  By late Monday, 2,866 locomotive engineers, or 96 percent of 
the striking engineers, had returned to work or expressed their 
intention to do so, and 1,986 assistant engineers, or 95 
percent, and 1,122 rolling stock inspectors, or 76 percent, 
followed suit.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Yu Chong-mo] </F>
  [Text] With the world abuzz over the North Korean nuclear 
problem these days, an extraordinary kind of nuclear crisis is 
brewing in South Korea. The deadline for the government to 
secure a place to permanently store radioactive wastes from 
domestic nuclear power plants is fast approaching. But officials 
at the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) are finding 
themselves increasingly helpless in the face of strong 
resistance from local residents who fear their `backyards' might 
be contaminated. 
  Analysts warn South Korea may have to suspend its nuclear 
power generation around 2001 should it fail to find a permanent 
storage by the end of next year. Considering atomic reactors 
account for nearly 40 percent of electricity consumption here, 
suspension of their operations would deal a hard blow to 
national economy. 
  In Korea, where the first nuclear power plant was built in 
1978, nine reactors are currently in operation, generating about 
4,500 to 5,000 drums of radioactive waste annually. The 
mountains of waste, however, have been stored at provisional 
facilities inside nuclear power plants, raising problems 
regarding safety and capacity. 
  The government, keenly aware that the temporary depots will 
be filled before 2001, has desperately searched since the late 
1980s for a region willing to host a waste dump. 
  Seven coastal towns had been designated as candidate sites 
and MOST promised to redevelop the finally selected town into a 
comprehensive science and research complex at a cost of 760 
billion won. The ministry also offered to spend 3 billion won 
annually on improving the welfare of the concerned residents. 
  But each time the government's efforts ended in failure in 
the face of angry protests from Nimby [not in my backyard] 
activists. In the latest incident, the ministry early this month 
had to scrap its plan to build a dump site in Uljin, North 
Kyongsang Province, after residents there staged violent street 
demonstrations. 
  Waste from the nuclear power stations is classified into two 
kinds according to the degree of radioactivity. Used nuclear 
fuel and substances reprocessed from the used fuel are called 
highly radioactive wastes. As Korea strictly abides by IAEA 
[International Atomic Energy Agency] regulations, reprocessed 
wastes, like plutonium essential to making N-bombs, are not 
produced here. 
  Low-grade radioactive wastes refer to almost all kinds of 
throwaway items used at the nuclear power stations, including 
operators' clothes, shoes, gloves, and tools. 
  A total of 43,700 drums of low-grade wastes have been 
produced by the nine reactors through April, occupying over 55 
percent of the existing temporary depots, whose aggregated 
maximum capacity is 79,900 drums, the Korea Electric Power Corp. 
(KEPCO) said. Depots of highly radioactive wastes were also 
filled up to 57 percent of capacity. 
  KEPCO has recently expanded Kori's storage capacity by 
23,000 
drums and taken other emergency countermeasures. Nevertheless, 
one after another temporary depot will reach saturation between 
1995 and 2001 -- Uljin Nuclear Power Station in 1995, Yonggwang 
in 1999, and Kori and Wolsong in 2001, respectively. 
  Considering that it takes at least six to seven years to 
build a permanent storage facility, the selection process has to 
be finished by the end of next year. On the other hand, the fact 
that seven more reactors are currently under construction adds 
to the seriousness of the problem. 
  Furthermore, the Nimby syndrome is likely to intensify with 
the advent of the provincial self-rule system next year. 
  Despite a series of studies confirming the safety of 
preserved radioactive wastes, the public doubts hardly show 
signs of abating. A recent poll found that 52.5 percent of the 
people have negative image toward nuclear-related matters and 
nearly half mistakenly believe that reactors can suddenly 
explode just like an atomic bomb. Shortly after the survey, MOST 
officials started to call radioactive waste "nuclear byproducts" 
in its bid to dispel the negative image. 
  As part of the government's last-ditch publicity efforts, 
Science and Technology Minister Kim Si-chung had a mini nuclear 
waste dump installed next to his office in Kwachon last December. 
  MOST once considered building a permanent depot on an 
uninhabited island or in an abandoned mine, but such plans 
turned out to be ineffective. 
  If the government fails to meet the deadline eventually, 
even 
the possibility of "exporting" the wastes should be explored, a 
MOST official laments.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Sin Yong-pae] </F>
  [Text] The National Assembly yesterday opened a 20-day 
extraordinary session to elect the new parliamentary leadership 
and to deal with other pending issues. 
  After an opening ceremony, ruling and opposition lawmakers 
passed a revision of the National Assembly Law through a plenary 
session. 
  On Tuesday, the Assembly is scheduled to select the new 
parliamentary speaker, the two vice speakers and chairmen of 
standing committees. 
  Rep. Hwang Nak-chu nominated by the ruling Democratic 
Liberal 
Party (DLP) is the sole candidate for the successor to outgoing 
Speaker Yi Man-sop. 
  Rep. Yi failed to be renominated by the DLP because he has 
allegedly been feuding with party leaders. The feud is said to 
have been triggered when Yi refused to cooperate in the DLP's 
plan to railroad the controversial budget bill for fiscal 1994 
through the Assembly in December last year. 
  Hwang, a five-term lawmaker, is a close associate of 
President Kim Yong-sam and draws support from the mainstream in 
the DLP, most of whom are Kim loyalists. 
  The nomination of Hwang is expected to gain swift approval 
from the Assembly members given that the DLP controls the 
299-member unicameral legislature. 
  DLP lawmaker Yi Chun-ku and opposition Democratic Party 
lawmaker Hong Yong-ki will most likely become vice Assembly 
speakers. The Assembly will also deal with the appointment of 
new justices of the Supreme Court during a plenary session July 
9. 
  But there is a possibility that opposition lawmakers may 
take 
issue over the past careers of some appointees who have been 
accused because their "politicized" rules under previous 
military-backed government. 
  The first summit meeting being pushed by the two Koreas is 
expected to be capped in the interpellation session during July 
4 to 8. The government's policy on the North Korean nuclear 
standoff is also expected to become an issue of contention 
between lawmakers of the ruling and opposition parties. 
  In addition, the Assembly will handle the 
government-proposed 
supplementary budget scaled at 384 billion won (about $476 
million). The bill is designed to help ease the economic plight 
of farmers and fishermen in the wake of the partial opening of 
domestic agro-fisheries markets to foreign supplies. 
  But political observers predict that the Assembly session is 
unlikely to draw much attention because of the focus of public 
interest on the World Cup and the first inter-Korean summit. 
Furthermore, major parties' preparations for two upcoming 
by-elections for the Assembly slated for around the end of next 
month are expected to reduce their concentration on 
parliamentary activities.

  [Text] The National Assembly passed a new National Assembly 
Law designed to implement sweeping reform in operations of the 
legislative body in a special session that opened Saturday. 
  The revised law stipulates the establishment of the National 
Assembly Intelligence Committee which will audit the budget of 
the Agency for National Security Planning (NSP) and oversee 
overall activities of the powerful intelligence agency. 
  Under the law, the committee will have 12 lawmakers as 
members. Rep. Chong Chae-mun of the ruling Democratic Liberal 
Party was reportedly tapped to become chairman of the committee. 
  The Assembly also passed a revision to the Law on Additional 
Punishment for Specific Crime which stipulates punishment of up 
to a five-year prison term or 5 million won in fines for 
intelligence committee members and their secretaries accused of 
leaking official secrets. 
  According to the new law, lawmakers are not allowed to 
interpellate Cabinet members at the Assembly plenary session 
longer than 15 minutes. Thus far, the maximum duration of the 
interpellation was 30 minutes. 
  The clause is aimed at preventing lawmakers from making 
harangues or asking same questions as those already asked by 
other lawmakers previously. 
  Instead, the law introduced the "four-minute free speech 
system" under which any lawmaker can make a speech for up to 
four minutes during Assembly plenary sessions. The Assembly 
speaker is allowed to preside over the free speech session for 
one hour. 
  Assembly standing committees are obliged to hold two regular 
meetings every month under the law. 
  The law bans lawmakers owning businesses from being 
affiliated with Assembly standing committees related with their 
businesses. For example, a lawmaker owning a construction firm 
is barred from being a member of the Assembly Construction 
Committee. 
  The clause is aimed at preventing lawmakers from seeking 
profits by taking advantage of their status as members of 
related standing committees. 
  The new Assembly law introduced a clause aimed at 
discouraging lawmakers' absenteeism. Lawmakers who skip plenary 
or committee sessions without good reasons will see their 
allowances curtailed. 
  Under the new law, lawmakers will be able to ask for 
government documents even while the Assembly is in recess. 
  To encourage Assemblymen's legislation activities, the 
Legislation Information Center was set up at the National 
Assembly in accordance with the new law. 
  The revised law also allows live broadcasting of Assembly 
plenary and standing committee sessions through cable news 
networks.

<F P=106> [Report by Kim Song-kil] </F>
  [Text] Lawmakers are paying extra attention to the 
restructuring of committees during the second-half of the 
National Assembly, particularly the newly formed Intelligence 
Committee. 
  The first question is to what extent can the National 
Assembly Intelligence Committee control the Agency for National 
Security Planning [NSP]. The means for the National Assembly to 
control administrative departments are through budget and policy 
review for legislation. Unlike in the past, the National 
Assembly is known to have considerable, although not complete, 
control. 
  The NSP will submit to the Intelligence Committee all 
detailed data required for actual review of all budgets. This 
means that, from now on, the NSP will be on the National 
Assembly's review list as far as the budget is concerned. In 
the past, the NSP only reported to the National Assembly the 
total amount of NSP expenses and intelligence costs without any 
supporting documentation and thus, passed National Assembly 
review without disclosing any details. The Intelligence 
Committee budget review will not be open to the public, and only 
the total amount of the budget will be reported to the speaker 
and notified to the Budget Committee. 
  The NSP director could still refuse to answer questions in 
the National Assembly but, unlike in the past, will be preceded 
by the notification that the issue is critical to national 
security. 
  The position of the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP], however, 
is that the committee should refrain from questioning concrete 
matters of the department because they are state secrets. This 
is why the committee members have dual memberships. The DLP 
asserts that pending issues should be discussed by the National 
Assembly as the Intelligence Committee is banned from leaking 
secrets. Hence, considerable disagreement is expected between 
the ruling and opposition parties regarding the management of 
the Intelligence Committee. 
  Another matter of interest is the structure of the 
Intelligence Committee. 
  Since the members have to deal with state secrets, important 
post holders of the Democratic faction, including the Chairman 
of the Defense Committee Sin Sang-u (six-time elected) and 
former DLP Secretary General Hwang Myong-su (four-time elected) 
are possible candidates to chair the Intelligence Committee. 
  As agreed during the last floor-leader meeting between the 
ruling and opposition parties, 12 DLP and five Democratic Party 
lawmakers will be assigned to the committee. 
  The members should belong to a negotiation group and the 
floor leaders of the ruling and opposition parties will have 
positions. Members should include those from the six standing 
committees, including the Operation, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs 
and Unification, Home Affairs, Defense, and Administration and 
Economic Committees. 
  Such limitations on the qualification of the committee 
members is due to the confidentiality of the committee 
activities.

  [Text] Seoul, June 27 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic 
Liberal Party's nominations for National Assembly posts Monday 
further bolstered President Kim Yong-sam's line after last 
year's personnel reshuffle. 
  The nominations followed the common practice of choosing the 
most-elected lawmakers, and no outstanding exceptions emerged. 
  But this was President Kim's first national lineup after 
December's large-scale reshuffle of his party and the government 
and last April's dismissal of Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, the 
reason the nominations raised political antennae. 
  The new house speaker and assembly committee chairmen will 
be 
tasked with supporting the latter half of Kim's presidential 
term and adapting to changing circumstances in inter-Korean 
relations and the post-Uruguay Round trade climate, among other 
things. 
  Local autonomy elections are coming up in June next year, 
and 
a massive redrawing of the DLP camp is looming late this year or 
in early 1995. President Kim most certainly had this in mind 
when he made the nominations. 
  In this context, Rep. Hwang Nak-chu was selected as house 
speaker, even though his nomination entailed a minor political 
gamble. The reason: Hwang was vice speaker when the ruling 
camp railroaded the new budget bill through the assembly last 
year. 
  The decision to promote Hwang reflects Kim's determination 
not to be elbowed aside in ruling-opposition party relations. 
  Rumor has it that the current house speaker, Yi Man-sop, 
will 
stay and that Rep. Kim Yong-tae will be tapped as his deputy in 
a goodwill gesture to the "TK forces," the acronym for those 
from Taegu and North Kyongsang Province, and in consideration of 
the upcoming by-election in Taegu. 
  Moreover, Reps. Kim Yong-tae and Kim Han-kyu were included 
in 
the list to appease the TK forces after the changing of the 
house speaker. 
  Rep. Yi Chun-ku, who has the president's personal trust, won 
the bid for house vice speaker in competition with Rep. Kim. 
  The house posts were filled with political considerations in 
mind, but National Assembly committee positions were meant to 
respond to the issue of regional and factional balance. 
  Floor leader Yi Han-tong orignally drew up a list that gave 
more than half of the committee chairmen posts to lawmakers from 
Pusan and South Kyongsang Province. 
  Secretary-general Mun Chong-su, however, changed the list 
before it was sent to the president. In the end, the most 
expected nominees, Kim Pong-cho and Chong Che-mun, were absent 
from the list -- An indication of how important attaining a 
regional balance was. 
  The final outcome stood at two from Pusan, two each for 
Taegu, Seoul, Kyonggi Province, Inchon and North Chungchong 
Province, one each from North Cholla Province and South 
Chungchong Province, and one lawmaker from a national 
constituency. 
  All of the choices, except for Rep. Pak Hui-tae and Sin 
Kyong-sik, are old-timers who have served three terms or more in 
office. 
  The last-minute dilemmas concerned the chairmen of the 
foreign affairs-national unification, finance, national defense 
and culture and information committees. 
  The DLP is planning on replacing all chiefs of city and 
provincial offices with three-term or more lawmakers next month 
and also on reshuffling party executive posts, foreshadowing a 
stormy summer ahead.

  [Text] Seoul, June 28 (YONHAP) -- Rep. Pak Chol-on was 
found guilty of taking bribes by the Supreme Court Tuesday, 
resulting in the loss of his National Assembly seat. 
  The highest court dismissed an appeal lodged by Pak, a 
lawmaker from the United People's Party convicted earlier of 
bribery and sentenced to one and a half years in prison and 
fined 600 million won (about 743,500 U.S. dollars) at an 
appellate court on March 14. 
  Pak, once called the "crown prince" during the days of the 
No 
Tae-u government, was arrested in May last year on charges of 
taking bribes totaling 600 million won in three installments 
from the country's slot-machine kingpins -- brothers Chong 
Tok-chin and Chong Tok-il -- in October and November 1990. 
  With the Supreme Court's decision, Pak also lost the right 
to 
run for parliament or other public office for five years from 
this November when his prison term ends. This means he cannot 
run in the 15th general election slated for the first half of 
1996 and signals the likely end of his political career. 
  His application for bail was automatically rejected. 
  A by-election to replace him will be held within 90 days in 
the Susong-A electoral district of Taegu City.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Cho Chae-hyon] </F>
  [Text] The Bank of Korea [BOK] said yesterday that domestic 
banks should be encouraged to become larger through mergers and 
acquisitions (M&amp;A) in order to efficiently compete with 
powerful 
foreign financial institutions. 
  Stressing that the level of domestic banks' 
internationalization is far lower than that of foreign banks, 
the central bank said Korean banks face disadvantages in making 
inroads into international financial markets due to their low 
credit standing which the BOK said stems from their smaller 
sizes and bloated nonperforming assets. 
  To get recognized as credible banks in international 
financial community, banks have to seek credit assessments from 
international credit rating companies like Standard &amp; Poor's 
or 
Moody's, but there are only three Korean banks including Korea 
First Bank, Hanil and Sinhan which have received credit ratings 
from them. 
  The BOK said one of the main reasons behind domestic banks' 
low credit standing in the international banking community is 
their smaller sizes. 
  For domestic banks to expand into overseas financial markets 
and raise funds cheaply abroad, they should expand their 
organizations which can be achieved through mergers and 
acquisitions. 
  In order to encourage M&amp;As between banks, the central 
bank 
said the government should, among other things, guarantee 
various financial incentives to those which try to press ahead 
with M&amp;As. It also called for the revision of related laws 
hampering M&amp;As by financial institutions. 
  It said that although international banking business is 
becoming more and more important in line with the trend to 
financial market liberalization and opening worldwide, Korean 
banks are lax in strengthening their muscle in the area. 
  To stimulate domestic banks' internationalization, it said 
management at banks should establish bolder longterm strategies 
such as expanding investment in hardware and software in 
international banking divisions. 
  "What banks should do first is to secure professionals who 
have skills and experience in international banking like foreign 
exchange, derivatives and financing for foreign enterprises," 
BOK's senior official Pak Chae-chun said. 
  He said the absence of international banking strategy at 
most 
banks is another element hampering their modernization. "To push 
for internationalization which is very costly, they need 
responsible and autonomous management which can establish 
long-term projects and press hard ahead with them. 
  The central bank called on banks to expand the number of 
their overseas branches and to actively develop foreign clients 
rather than Korean clients operating there. The Korean 
commercial banks' branches and subsidiaries operating overseas 
number only 127, far fewer than the 443 of 11 major Japanese 
banks. Furthermore, it also urged that overseas branches be 
localized in such a way as to hire more foreigners as top 
managers. 
  Korean banks have employed few foreigners in their overseas 
networks, which the BOK said blocks them from developing foreign 
clients. According to the central bank, the ratio of foreign 
managers to Korean managers at Korean banks' overseas branches 
is only 33.6 percent. On the other hand, the corresponding 
ratio of foreign banks operating here is 87.7 percent. 
  Korean commercial banks face limits in efficiently enhancing 
their international banking operations because they lack 
incentive systems in their personnel management. The central 
bank suggests that they pay higher wages to professional 
officials who deal with international banking than the other 
regular employees. 
  It also recommended the government ease all restrictions 
preventing domestic banks from expanding into international 
banking. It urged gradual relaxation or elimination of 
cumbersome foreign exchange regulations. In particular, in order 
to help banks strengthen their ability to finance foreign 
enterprises, it said they should be allowed to extend long-term 
loans with maturities of more than 10 years to foreign 
enterprises. 
  Domestic banks have faced many restrictions in foreign 
exchange transactions and developing derivative products due to 
heavy-handed regulations on daily foreign exchange fluctuation 
bands, foreign exchange holding and selling amounts. 
  Korean banks lag far behind foreign banks in terms of 
financial futures transactions which have become more important 
instruments to hedge against growing risks. 
  The outstanding amount of financial futures transactions of 
all domestic commercial banks is far smaller than at one 
American bank. That of Korean commercial banks amounted to only 
3.4 billion dollars at the end of last year, compared to 976.4 
billion dollars at Citibank of the U.S., it said. And the 
outstanding amount of Korean banks' derivative products was 5.9 
billion dollars, compared to 977.9 billion dollars for Citibank.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Kim Chang-yong] </F>
  [Text] Korea's motor vehicle industry, launched lees than 
30 years ago, has gained a firm and solid footing in the 
international market both by its expanding trade volume and 
enhancing quality. 
  Already the sixth largest producer in the world, the 
latecomer pursues fifth place before the close of the present 
century in its aggressive "X-5 Project," mapped out by the Kim 
Yong-sam administration with an eye to putting further vigor 
into the auto field, locomotive of Korea's exports. 
  Individual companies, especially Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors 
and Daewoo Motor, have their own visions of a brighter future, 
pooling their wisdom and energy for a life-and-death battle on 
one hand and cashing in on government policy on the other. 
  "Korea is one of several countries that has jumped into the 
highly sophisticated technology- and capital-intensive sector 
since World War II but is the only country that has now 
succeeded there," Cho Kwan-hyon, executive vice chairman of the 
Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association [KAMA], said in an 
interview at his office yesterday. 
  The 58-year-old Cho was recently elected vice president of 
the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers 
(OICA), a Paris-based federation of 28 national organizations, 
all representative of world auto producers and importers. 
  "My election is primarily attributable to the strong 
position 
of Korea's auto industry on the global scene. I think as an 
OICA vice president, I can in turn promote the stature of our 
industry one rung on the ladder to world leadership," a beaming 
Cho viewed. 
  He will head the organization, established in 1919 and 
granted United Nations Consultative Status as early as 1956, 
along with one president and two other vice presidents for the 
coming two years. 
  His accession to the post is an honor, the first to date for 
a developing country. His predecessors have been all from just 
a handful of auto powers including the United States, Germany, 
France, Italy and Japan. 
  He said he would devote himself to articulating the voices 
of 
Korean and Asian automakers in the organization and 
consolidating their roles in the development of the world 
automobile and its industry, being faithful to OICA's general 
purposes. 
  Actually, OICA aims at ensuring permanent link between its 
members, undertaking, at their request, studies on any question 
of mutual interest, collecting and circulating any useful 
information for the benefit of member associations and their 
respective members and representing the auto industry in 
intergovernmental and international bodies. 
  The OICA vice president particularly plans to help Korea 
join 
three committees--the Technical Committee, Industrial and 
Economic Policy Committee and Exhibition Committee. KAMA got 
its OICA membership quite belatedly, in 1991, at his initiative 
but has yet to be admitted to the specialized panels. 
  He seeks the organization's expertise on the setup of a 
massive domestic motor show, scheduled for May next year in 
Seoul, as the first full-scale show of its kind. KAMA, in close 
cooperation with member auto producers, started preparing it 
last year. 
  "During the one-week display," Cho said, "We will 
demonstrate 
the technology and service which our industry has accumulated 
over the last decades. 
  Based on the experience, KAMA will hold an international 
motor show in the spring or fall of 1997 though it will chart 
out details for the scheme after the local event. 
  He painted a very rosy picture for the domestic auto 
industry 
in the present and future as well, foreseeing that it would 
produce an estimated 5 million units including overseas output 
in the year 2000 and stand only next to the United States, 
Japan, Germany and France. "We will engage in a neck-and-neck 
race with France then." 
  "The situation remains favorable. First of all, the home 
market is stable. It is only here that auto sales swell by 10 
percent or more annually. Korean automakers will be able to 
make another jump- start by making the most of the local market 
over the three or four years. 
  "Korean-built cars have unchallenged price competitiveness. 
Given extensive investment in the research and development and 
subsequent improvement in quality and styling, they will pose a 
threat to century-old world top-notch brands," he reasoned. 
  Domestic producers are success-oriented and full of 
confidence. 
  For one thing, he noted, Hyundai is going ahead with its 
"Global Top 10 Project" designed to produce 2 million units by 
2000, equal to the current output of Volkswagen and even more 
than that of Mitsubishi or Mazda. Kia and Daewoo are 
benchmarking Hyundai's "can-do spirit and ambitious push." 
  Cho complained about the administration's "hasty" concession 
to the U.S. pressure to lower the tariff on imported vehicles. 
"The administration's hasty slash of the tariff to 8 percent is 
much lower than the internationally-acknowledged rate of 10 
percent. The European Union, for instance, levies a 10 percent 
tariff on foreign cars and we have to give European cars 
preferential treatment here," he stressed.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 28 KYODO -- The Japan Automobile 
Manufacturers' Association issued a report Tuesday [28 June] 
summing up pending issues in Japan-U.S. automobile trade, 
arguing that Japan's auto market is open. 
  The association said cooperation between Japanese and U.S. 
automobile and auto parts industries to enhance bilateral trade 
is bearing fruit. 
  It said the report was compiled on the occasion of the 
resumption of Japan-U.S. negotiations for a new bilateral trade 
"framework." 
  The report said Japanese automakers are continuing efforts 
to 
increase procurement from U.S. auto parts makers. 
  In referring to a sales drive in Japan by the "big three" 
U.S. automakers, General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and 
Chrysler Corp., the report said those firms still need to step 
up efforts to sell more vehicles. 
  It said the U.S. automakers have not developed small 
vehicles 
with an engine capacity of less than 2000 cc which account for 
more than 80 percent of the Japanese auto market. 
  The association said an English version of the report will 
be 
distributed in the United States later.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 28 KYODO -- The government will 
continue to make efforts to open Japan's markets following the 
release Tuesday [28 June] of a package of deregulatory measures 
aiming at expanding domestic demand and boosting imports, 
Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said. 
  Kakizawa told a press conference the Foreign Ministry will 
explain the package to the United States, the European Union and 
other nations. 
  The package, a detailed version of portions of a 
market-opening program released in March, contains 279 
deregulatory steps prepared by the government's administrative 
reform promotion headquarters. 
  Kakizawa said the latest package meets some of the demands 
made by other countries. 
  Japan pledged to come up with deregulatory measures before 
the Naples summit of the Group of Seven industrialized nations 
in July.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 28 KYODO -- The government released a 
package of deregulatory measures Tuesday aimed at expanding 
domestic demand and thus the nation's appetite for imports, both 
intended to upgrade the overall livelihood of the Japanese 
people. 
  The package, which contains 279 deregulatory steps prepared 
by the government's administrative reform promotion 
headquarters, is the "product of an all-out effort" for economic 
restructuring by the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, a 
government official said. 
  The package, a detailed version of portions of a 
market-opening program released in March, is designed to 
demonstrate Japan's seriousness about deregulation, the official 
said. 
  The official said whoever replaces outgoing Premier Hata, 
who 
announced Saturday he would resign, will work to enforce the 
measures. "There should not be any setback in implementation of 
the package under the pretext of the current political 
confusion." 
  The official said the latest package addresses government 
restrictions and regulations in four priority sectors -- housing 
and land, financial services, information and telecommunications 
and market access by foreign firms. 
  The steps are aimed at promoting new businesses, giving 
consumers greater product selection and narrowing the price gap 
on goods in Japan and abroad, the official said. 
  Japan pledged to come up with deregulatory measures before 
the Naples summit of the Group of Seven industrialized nations 
in July. 
  The administrative reform promotion headquarters will craft 
a 
five-year program designed to implement the proposals by the end 
of fiscal 1994, the official said. 
  Meanwhile, government ministries and agencies will be asked 
to formulate specific measures in line with new deregulation 
guidelines drawn up by the panel. 
  The guidelines include a drastic review of restrictions 
enforced as a way to adjust supply-demand ties for certain 
products, a reduction in rate-setting rules for public services, 
harmonization of Japan's standards and certificates with 
international rules and the halting of business practices that 
effectively hamper foreign entry to Japan's markets. 
  The guidelines also call for clearer, simplified procedures 
for administrative permits, including import inspection systems. 
  The panel urged strict enforcement of the antimonopoly law 
to 
ensure fair and free competition and called for a proposal by 
the end of fiscal 1994 to outlaw in five years some cartels 
currently allowed as exceptions under the law. 
  The panel also unveiled a plan to abolish by the end of 
fiscal 1998 the resale price maintenance system, a protective 
measure allowed for designated product items. 
  Other measures designed to spur competition include review 
of 
screening procedures for corporate mergers and stock ownership 
and a change in rules banning establishment of a holding company. 
  The official said a set of measures announced on housing and 
land policies are intended to provide the Japanese people with 
high-quality houses at affordable prices. 
  To that end, rules and regulations in construction and 
materials procurement will be relaxed, including acceptance of 
foreign data on materials and simplification of building permits. 
  The panel said the scope of housing construction subject to 
public loans will be expanded, while the legal framework for 
land development projects will be modified. 
  It said inspection standards will be eased for companies 
trying to enter the information and telecommunications industry. 
  Charges on services provided by Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone Corp. (NTT) and other common carriers will be set more 
freely, with government approval needed only for basic services 
charges. 
  On market access measures, the panel called for smooth 
enforcement of steps announced in may to ease the large-scale 
retail store law. But it refrained from seeking abolition of 
the law, apparently considering its impact on small retailers. 
  The reform panel said the government will study whether to 
allow self-service gas stations by looking into technical 
standards and other safety measures that would be required for 
such stations. 
  Other market-access steps include abolition of a law at the 
end of fiscal 1996 that limits imports of gasoline and other 
petroleum products to oil refiners. 
  On the financial sector, steps will be taken to liberalize 
rate-setting formulas for liquid deposits and housing loans and 
promote financial derivatives transactions. 
  A set of steps to deregulate the securities market were also 
included as a way to diversify corporate fund raising. 
  The panel said the latest package should be carried out 
under 
supervision of an administrative reform committee, a third-party 
organ likely to be created in line with a bill now in parliament. 
  A follow-up report on the latest package will be worked out 
by the end of this fiscal year, the official said. 
  The package will be formalized by the government but the 
timing of the formalization is yet undetermined considering 
Japan's political upheaval.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 28 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
said Tuesday [28 June] the deregulation package unveiled by the 
government the same day will change the nature of Japan's 
economy and show the direction in which the country should be 
heading. 
  Speaking at the administrative reform promotion 
headquarters, 
Hata said the package will be approved by the succeeding cabinet 
as soon as possible. 
  The current political scene remains mired in confusion in 
the 
wake of the Hata cabinet's resignation announcement on Saturday. 
  The scheme, compiled by the headquarters, contains 279 
deregulatory measures in the fields of real estate, financial 
services, information and telecommunications. 
  The plan was prepared in line with the government's 
market-access program announced in March to boost imports and 
spur domestic demand.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 28 KYODO -- The ruling coalition is 
likely to accept an overture from the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] and stage a 
meeting between Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and SDP Chairman 
Tomiichi Murayama to discuss forming a new government, political 
sources said Tuesday. 
  Murayama and Masayoshi Takemura, New Party Sakigake head and 
a former chief cabinet secretary, agreed Monday that the next 
government should be a "dove," or soft-line government, based on 
an agreed policy outline. 
  Takemura, who is critical of what he views as high-handed 
leadership by Shinseito and Komeito within the coalition, made 
it clear that his party has no plans to reconcile with the group 
and urged Murayama to head the new government. 
  In a separate meeting, Yohei Kono, president of the main 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), proposed a trilateral 
meeting with Murayama and Takemura for a breakthrough pact. 
  Takemura said Sakigake wants to serve as bridge between the 
LDP and the SDP in forming an alliance between the one-time 
archrivals. 
  Murayama and Kono agreed on the need to elect a new premier 
Tuesday. The current regular Diet session expires Wednesday. 
  Murayama and Kono also concurred in jointly taking "heavy 
responsibility" for breaking the current political standoff 
following the resignation of Hata and his cabinet on Saturday 
prior to an impending no-confidence vote against his minority 
cabinet tabled by the LDP in the House of Representatives. 
  Hata is the sixth prime minister in Japan in five years. 
None of the parties has a majority in the lower house. 
  The ruling coalition had earlier said it will wait for the 
SDP's initiative for fresh talks on a policy agreement before 
any high- stakes meeting between the party heads. 
  The SDP's policy-making board, on the other hand, endorsed 
the joint policy platform with Sakigake and called on the 
coalition to make a formal response to its proposal for the 
Murayama-Hata talks by 11 AM [0200 GMT] Tuesday. 
  Within the LDP, a growing number of party members are 
tilting 
toward a partnership with the SDP, party sources said. 
  The LDP had been in power since 1955 until last August when 
the then coalition of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, which 
included the SDP and Sakigake, took power. 
  But former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, an LDP faction 
leader, is opposed to an alliance with the SDP and called for a 
team up with Hata's Shinseito and Komeito, the key parties in 
the coalition. 
  Within the SDP, a left-wing group led by Murayama is said to 
be in favor of a tie-up with the LDP. 
  However, a right-wing group, including Secretary General 
Wataru Kubo, the No. 2 leader in the party, is seeking the 
return of the SDP to the coalition, party sources said. 
  The SDP earlier made a decision at a meeting of its 
decision- 
making central committee in May that it will not form a 
coalition with the LDP. 
  The SDP walked out from the coalition in April in protest 
against the formation of a parliamentary group by other 
coalition partners, excluding the SDP, shortly after the 
election of Hata as prime minister in the Diet. The SDP's 
departure forced Hata to launch the first minority government in 
39 years.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 28 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] wants to 
discuss forming a new government with the ruling coalition, the 
key strategist of the coalition said Tuesday [28 June]. 
  Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito, a key party in 
the coalition, told reporters the coalition has accepted the 
SDP's offer to meet. 
  The SDP, which is the second largest opposition party, faces 
a crucial choice of whether it would return to the coalition or 
forge an alliance with the boggest opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP), SDP's archrival so far. The LDP was ousted from 
government last August after 38 years in power.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 28 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) [SDPJ -- Social Democratic Party of Japan] on Tuesday 
spurned a call from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) for talks 
on the joint establishment of a coalition government. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, in a meeting with LDP 
President Yohei Kono, said the SDP, the second largest 
opposition party, cannot hold such talks with the LDP as it will 
open a policy dialogue with the ruling coalition Wednesday, SDP 
Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a news conference. 
  But Kubo later said his party will officially respond to the 
LDP request by 6 p.m. Wednesday. 
  The coalition and the SDP agreed earlier Tuesday to kick off 
talks to narrow differences over major policy issues and explore 
the possibility of fashioning a fresh coalition government. 
  The SDP walked out of the latest ruling union in April, 
leaving Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata overseeing Japan's first 
minority administration since 1955. Hata resigned Saturday with 
his entire cabinet. 
  In his meeting with Murayama, Kono said the LDP, the biggest 
opposition force, will back the SDP chief as a candidate for the 
premiership if the two parties share in a government, Kubo said. 
  But Murayama only thanked the LDP for its proposal and 
explained that the SDP cannot begin talks on the framework of a 
new government with the LDP, citing the scheduled policy 
dialogue with the coalition, Kubo said. 
  Murayama and Kono reportedly agreed that their parties will 
do their utmost to sort out the present political confusion 
within Wednesday, when the term of the current 150-day ordinary 
Diet session expires. 
  In a separate news conference, LDP Secretary General Yoshiro 
Mori said Kono repeatedly urged Murayama to start negotiations 
for a possible coalition government with the LDP but failed to 
win approval. 
  The LDP would have to put up Kono as a candidate for the 
next 
premier if no conclusion is reached by Wednesday evening on 
whether the SDP will rejoin the coalition or team up with the 
LDP. 
  The LDP and the SDP, archrivals under the LDP's 38-year 
unbroken rule that ended last August, are widely apart on key 
policy issues such as diplomacy and national security, raising 
doubts about the possibility of a successful alliance.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 28 KYODO -- Japan's No. 2 opposition 
party, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ -- Social 
Democratic Party of Japan], moved a step forward Tuesday [28 
June] toward rejoining the coalition which it quit in late 
April, political sources said. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama held talks with leaders of 
seven coalition parties Tuesday at the Diet to discuss a new 
framework for a new government. 
  The leaders of the coalition and SDP agreed to begin studies 
on policies for a new government, which the sources said needs 
to be managed "democratically." 
  Meanwhile, the No. 1 opposition party, the Liberal 
Democratic 
Party (LDP), continued efforts to establish a grand coalition 
with the SDP in an effort to regain the power it lost 10 months 
ago. 
  LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori, in a meeting with SDP 
Secretary General Wataru Kubo in the Diet, proposed putting up 
Murayama as head of a new three-party coalition among the LDP, 
SDP and new party Sakigake, an LDP splinter group. 
  Mori also called for an early summit between Murayama and 
LDP 
President Yohei Kono. 
  Kubo, however, did not respond immediately to the LDP's 
offer 
and instead told Mori that the SDP will put the priority on 
talks with the ruling coalition, the sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 28 KYODO -- The governing coalition 
parties and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ -- Social 
Democratic Party of Japan] agreed Tuesday to open policy 
dialogue Wednesday as a step toward the formation of a new 
coalition government, coalition leaders announced. "We agreed 
that all the parties should do their utmost to sort out the 
current political turmoil and fulfill their duties," Komeito 
Chairman Koshiro Ishida told a news conference. 
  The coalition parties and the SDP, a former coalition 
partner, reached the agreement when coalition chiefs and SDP 
Chairman Tomiichi Murayama met to discuss the possibility of the 
SDP's rejoining the coalition. 
  Departing Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata also attended the 
top-level gathering as he heads Shinseito, a key coalition force. 
  Although the coalition parties and the SDP agreed to kick 
off 
talks to narrow their differences over key policy issues, this 
does not necessarily imply the SDP's imminent return to the 
ruling camp, political sources said. "We will move on to talks 
to form a new government after reaching an accord on policy," 
Takashi Yonezawa, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, 
told the same news conference. 
  The policy talks between the coalition and the SDP, which 
left the governing alliance in April, will begin Wednesday when 
the SDP presents a fresh blueprint for a new coalition 
government. The seven coalition party chiefs and Murayama also 
concurred on the need for a more transparent and democratic 
political management style, Ishida said. 
  In a related development, Murayama and Yohei Kono, president 
of the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), will 
open talks at 8 p.m. Tuesday in what appeared to be an attempt 
to explore the possibility of forging an alliance to form a new 
government. The top-level meeting will be preceded by talks 
between the secretaries general of the LDP and the SDP, party 
officials said. 
  The seven coalition party chiefs and Murayama also confirmed 
the SDP will call on new party Sakigake, also a former coalition 
member, to join a new government, Ishida said. 
  The SDP's withdrawal stripped the coalition of its majority 
in both houses of the the Diet. 
  To avert certain defeat in a no-confidence vote, Hata 
resigned with his two-month-old cabinet Saturday, prompting a 
flurry of plays for power over the framework of a new government. 
  The LDP continued efforts Tuesday to launch a grand 
coalition 
with the SDP, the LDP's archrival during its 38-year unbroken 
rule that ended last August, in a bid to regain power. LDP 
Secretary General Yoshiro Mori, in a meeting with SDP Secretary 
General Wataru Kubo, proposed putting up Murayama as head of a 
new three-party coalition government among the LDP, the SDP and 
Sakigake, an LDP splinter party. 
  Kubo, however, did not respond immediately to the LDP's 
offer 
and instead told Mori that the SDP will give priority to talks 
with the coalition. 
  Meanwhile, Murayama and Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura 
agreed to hold another round of talks Wednesday, officials said. 
Takemura, speaking at a Tokyo party commemorating the 
anniversary of the establishment of Sakigake, criticized the SDP 
for its moves to rejoin the coalition. "An increasing number of 
SDP legislators are making moves by basing their judgments on 
benefits they will be able to enjoy at the next election under 
the single-seat constituency system, rather than on ideals and 
policies," he said. 
  Takemura was apparently referring to anxieties among some 
SDP 
legislators that unless they were nominated as joint coalition 
in single-seat constituencies, they might lose in the next 
election. "I want the Social Democratic Party to become the 
core" of a new coalition government, he said. "Sakigake will 
not waver between the right and left spectrum of political 
forces," Takemura said in an apparent appeal to the SDP not to 
return to the fold of the present coalition.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 28 KYODO -- Outgoing Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata on Tuesday [28 June] called for extending the 
current parliamentary session beyond its deadline of Wednesday 
to enable the Diet to pick a new prime minister. 
  "It is inconceivable that the Diet should end its session 
before a new cabinet has been formed," said Hata, who announced 
Saturday his intention to resign along with his entire cabinet. 
Hata remains in office until his replacement is picked. 
  Hata made the comments as his ruling coalition is stepping 
up 
its bid to woo the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ -- Social 
Democratic Party of Japan] back into its fold to create a 
stable, majority government. 
  The House of Representatives is to convene a plenary session 
at 10 a.m. Wednesday. 
  However, it remains unclear whether the lower chamber will 
be 
able to vote on a successor to Hata on Wednesday in view of 
intensifying parliamentary maneuverings by both the coalition 
and the no. 1 opposition Liberal Democratic Party to win over 
the socialists to their respective camps. 
  A source at the lower house's Diet steering committee, "it 
is 
in line with common sense that we should extend the Diet session 
by about a week until the second week of July, while seeking to 
pick a successor before the Naples Summit begins (July 8)." 
  Some LDP executives are trying to form a new coalition 
government comprising the LDP, SDP and new party Sakigake by 
forcing a vote during Wednesday's Diet session, while preventing 
the coalition from buying time to convince the SDP to return to 
its fold, Diet sources said. 
  "The coalition would not be able to extend the Diet if the 
LDP and SDP, which contains the proponents of an SDP-LDP 
alliance, jointly opposes such an extension," the source said. 
  In such an eventuality, the Diet would be forced to close 
its 
session temporarily and then hold an extraordinary session to 
pick a new premier and approve a bill defining the new 300 
single-seat constituencies, the sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 28 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
on Tuesday welcomed the agreement between North and South Korea 
to hold their first summit meeting next month, saying it is 
"good news." 
  North and South Korean officials agreed earlier in the day 
to 
hold a meeting of their leaders in Pyongyang on July 25-27, 
followed by a second meeting at a later date, with the place 
still to be decided. 
  The summit would also have a good effect on the relations 
between Japan and North Korea, Hata told reporters. 
  On the prospects for Japanese economic and technological 
assistance to North Korea, Hata predicted smooth progress if the 
nuclear issue is settled in forthcoming high-level talks between 
the United States and North Korea.

  [Text] Washington, June 24 KYODO -- Michel Camdessus, 
managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), 
expressed support Friday [24 June] for concerted international 
effort to support the dollar and said rapid appreciation of the 
yen would harm the Japanese economy. 
  "There are good reasons for the key central banks ... to 
give 
clear signals to the market that this instability is nonsense 
and must be stopped," he said in an interview with KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE. 
  The IMF chief said big swings in currency markets are bad 
for 
the economies involved. "Too rapid rise of the yen would be bad 
for the recovery timidly starting in Japan." 
  For the United States, he said, further depreciation of the 
dollar does not make sense because the U.S. economic 
fundamentals "are certainly at the best levels during the last 
20 years." 
  Camdessus also dismissed arguments that the dollar-buying 
operation launched by the monetary authorities in the U.S. and 
other industrial powers has little effect on the market. 
  "This kind of thing cannot be (measured) on a daily basis, 
or 
on an hour-to-hour basis," he said. 
  "These interventions are effective not so much by the 
equilibrium of the market at a given moment but by the signal 
they give to the market players," he said. 
  Camdessus said that over time the currency market does serve 
as a barometer of economic health. 
  If intervention fails to produce a positive effect over 
time, 
"this could signal that further measures such as strengthening 
the macroeconomic picture could be needed, be it stimulating a 
little bit more the recovery in Japan, be it in the U.S. to make 
efforts to cut the deficit," he said. 
  "But," Camdessus added, "this is not the problem of today." 
  Camdessus also argued for the establishment of a so-called 
target zone for currencies, saying such a monetary system would 
yield more benefit than cost. 
  In the short term, he said, countries participating in a 
currency target system may have to pay higher prices in terms of 
economic growth or employment. 
  Over the long term, Camdessus said, the economic benefits of 
a target-zone system would be bigger because of stable 
currencies. 
  "It is my conviction that target zones, target ranges, 
target 
techniques, could be an important instrument to get a 
strengthened stability of exchange markets," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- A prominent businessman 
said Monday [27 June] Japan should urge the United States to 
raise interest rates and cut its deficit in order to cap the 
sharp appreciation of the yen against the dollar. 
  In a statement released Monday, Takeshi Nagano, president of 
the Japan Federation of Employers Association, said he is 
worried about the impact on the economy of the dollar's collapse 
and the political turmoil resulting from Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata's resignation. 
  Nagano warned an excessive appreciation of the yen could 
kill 
the Japanese manufacturing sector. 
  He called on the government for a speedy stimulation of 
domestic demand through deregulation and the opening of Japanese 
markets to imports. 
  The dollar temporarily plummeted to a new post World War II 
lows of 99.50 yen Monday morning in Tokyo.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- Japanese business leaders 
voiced anxiety Monday [27 June] about the yen's vigorous surge 
against the U.S. dollar in recent days, fearing a fallout on the 
fragile economy. 
  Many leaders pinpointed yet another political crisis 
triggered by the resignation of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on 
Saturday as a factor which drove the yen above the 100-to-the 
dollar level in Monday dealings in Tokyo. 
  They expressed hopes that the political tempest will be 
calmed and the yen stabilized, while calling for boosted joint 
intervention by major economic powers. 
  Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry, said the yen's surge is "a regrettable matter both for 
the Japanese and global economy." 
  Other leaders said the yen's renewed strength would rid the 
Japanese economy of the little vitality it has to recover. 
  Even officials in the electric power and retail sectors, 
which can benefit from a stronger yen, are worried that high-yen 
drawbacks will outweigh merits. 
  In the long term, the leaders also said, the high yen will 
accelerate the hollowing out of Japanese industry, encouraging 
further shifts to overseas production and boosting unemployment. 
  To bring the yen under control, the business community urged 
an end to the political turmoil and more powerful actions by 
financial authorities in major countries. 
  Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of 
Employers Associations, noted the United States could take 
measures to stop the dollar's fall, such as reducing the budget 
deficit and a raising interest rates. 
  Itochu Corp. President Minoru Murofushi also suggested the 
Bank of Japan lower the official discount rate to discourage 
yen-buyers.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- Japan will take 
"aggressive" action to stem the yen's rise in cooperation with 
the Group of Seven (G-7) nations, Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii told reporters Monday [27 June]. 
  Fujii described the dollar's fall in Tokyo below 100 yen as 
"speculative" and said, "rapid movements are undesirable and 
this is a consensus among G-7 nations." 
  Fujii said G-7 partners are communicating on whether to take 
joint measures as they did last Friday, when the dollar fell 
below 100 yen in New York. 
  As for Japan, Fujii said, "we will tenaciously take utmost 
efforts" to defend the dollar against the yen. 
  Market sources said the bank of Japan bought billions of 
dollars when the Tokyo market opened Monday, after watching the 
dollar plunge below 100 yen in earlier trading in Sydney. 
  Asked if Japan's political turmoil contributed to the yen's 
rise, Fujii just repeated the movements are "speculative." 
  Fujii declined to comment on possible joint G-7 actions on 
credit policies, saying, "monetary measures are for the central 
bank to decide." 
  When the dollar tumbled in may on a broad front and nearly 
sank below 100 yen, G-7 nations intervened in currency markets 
and also took action on credit policies. 
  The United States raised its key rates, Germany cut its key 
rates, other European nations followed suit and Japan maintained 
a loose stance on the money market. 
  Higher U.S. rates and lower rates in other nations will help 
the dollar become stronger as dollar assets will become 
favorable.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- Japan and other Group of 
Seven (G-7) major nations are discussing "various measures," 
Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito said Monday [27 June], 
suggesting joint intervention alone is ineffective in stemming 
the dollar's broad- based plunge. 
  The G-7 nations are in "close contact to exchange 
information 
to take various actions but details are not yet decided," Saito 
told a regular news conference. 
  Pressed by reporters if those measures would include joint 
credit-policy actions, Saito said the present currency movements 
are "not as easy as to cope with just by interest rate 
differentials." 
  He added, "there are various ways such as Japan's ongoing 
efforts to reduce its trade surplus." 
  The dollar fell below 100 yen in Tokyo despite last Friday's 
joint G-7 intervention after the U.S. currency plunged below 
that level for the first time in the postwar period in New York 
last Tuesday. 
  With the joint intervention failing to prop up the dollar, 
global market attention is fixed on whether the G-7 nations will 
cooperate in credit policies as they did when the dollar fell 
near to sinking below 100 yen in May. 
  Together with joint market action, the United States raised 
its key interest rates, while Germany cut the key rates with 
other European nations following suit, with Japan maintaining a 
loose stance on the money market. 
  Higher U.S. rates and lower rates in other nations help the 
dollar fall as dollar assets become favorable. 
  Saito said G-7 nations "are concerned about the rapid, 
speculative movements," analyzing the trend as the yen's rise 
against the dollar in sympathy with the upswings in the German 
mark and other European currencies. 
  Japan will "continue taking tenacious action through close 
contact with other G-7 nations," Saito said, expressing concerns 
over the effect on the recovering economy.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- Vice Trade Minister Hideaki 
Kumano called Monday [27 June] for joint action by 
industrialized nations to stem the yen's rise against the 
dollar, calling the strong yen abnormal and detrimental to the 
global economy. 
  Kumano told a news conference the yen's sharp appreciation 
against the U.S. dollar does not reflect the fundamental factors 
of the Japanese economy and the government is concerned about it. 
  The yen closed at a postwar high of 99.93 yen against the 
dollar in Tokyo on Monday. 
  Kumano disagreed that the dollar's weakness against the 
German mark and other European currencies reflects the loss of 
confidence in the U.S. economy and added the dollar's decline is 
not desirable for the U.S. economy.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 28 KYODO -- International Trade and 
Industry Minister [MITI] Eijiro Hata said Tuesday [28 June] he 
has asked the monetary authorities to take action to stabilize 
the currency market. 
  Steps should be taken so that a burgeoning pickup of the 
Japanese economy will be sustained and shifted to a full 
recovery, Hata told reporters. 
  Hata said he explained "the voice" of Japan's industrial 
sectors struggling under the unmitigated strength of the yen 
when he met with Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii earlier in the 
day. 
  Fujii replied Japan is prepared to take action in concert 
with other Group of Seven (G-7) industrial countries, Hata said. 
  He said he has heard that the currency issue will be taken 
up 
at the upcoming G-7 summit in Naples, Italy. 
  The dollar sank to a new global low of 99.50 yen in Monday's 
Tokyo trading momentarily.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- Japanese industries have 
begun studying measures to overcome the rising value of the yen, 
including importing low-priced materials from overseas, industry 
sources said Monday [27 June]. 
  The yen has been on an uptrend [upward trend] against the 
U.S. currency, closing in Tokyo Monday at a postwar high of 
99.93 yen against the dollar. 
  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Nissan Motor Co., are now 
considering importing rolled steel from South Korea for use in 
their vehicles, the sources said. 
  They said rolled steel imported from South Korea is about 20 
percent cheaper than the domestic product. 
  Mitsubishi plans to use South Korean rolled steel for the 
interior of its cars, such as the inner face of doors, they said. 
  In addition, domestic shipbuilders, facing rising 
competition 
from South Korea, launched a study last year to import 
low-priced steel materials, the sources said. 
  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. has decided to import steel 
materials from South Korea and Brazil on a spot deal, and its 
imports of shipbuilding materials this year are expected to 
account for around 5 percent of the procurement, they said. 
  Shipbuilding firms are in a dilemma over the increasing use 
of imported materials, however, as customers want prices to be 
cut in line with cheaper production costs. 
  For similar reasons, construction and other industries are 
hesitating to increase imports of raw materials from overseas, 
the sources said. 
  They said automobile makers and shipbuilders are using 
low-priced imports as a tool for price bargaining with domestic 
steelmakers. 
  Export-oriented industries have been hit hard by the strong 
yen. 
  Kyushu Matsushita Electric Co., an affiliate of the world's 
leading consumer electronics maker Matsushita Electric 
Industrial Co., said the yen's rise by 1.00 yen per dollar will 
produce a loss of 1.8 billion yen per year. 
  The company has mapped out its business projection for the 
current year on the yen-dollar exchange level of 105 yen per 
dollar. 
  Yoshihiro Yasui, president of Japan's top sewing machine 
maker Brother Industries Ltd., described the yen's rise above 
the 100 yen per dollar level as epoch-making. 
  Yasui said dollar-yen exchange rates are moving on 
speculation regardless of fundamental economic factors.

Eiichi Meguro on NHK's "emergency survey" on the yen's 
appreciation] 
  [Text] In connection with the yen's current appreciation, 
NHK conducted an emergency survey today with 30 major exporting 
companies, including automakers and electrical appliance 
companies. According to the survey, two-third of them initially 
expected to make greater business profits this year, and they 
hoped that their business would recover. However, only 7 
percent of these respondents said that they will earn higher 
profits even if the dollar remains at the level of 100 yen. On 
the other hand, nearly 40 percent of them said their business 
profits will decline. 
  As for the economic situation as a whole, 15 companies said 
that the economic recovery will be delayed, while 14 companies 
expressed concern that the economy will deteriorate again. It 
can be said that they consider the situation to be very serious. 
  When asked about measures to counter the yen's appreciation, 
17 companies plan to increase their overseas production, while 
13 companies plan to expand their imports of parts from foreign 
countries. They intend to deal with the yen's current 
appreciation by reducing costs through increasing both overseas 
production and the imports of parts. 
  If they increase production at their plants abroad, it is 
feared that this will cause industrial stagnation in Japan. For 
example, there are concerns that this will affect domestic 
employment and technological development. 
  As for domestic employment, only 30 percent of these 
respondents said that they are going to maintain their current 
number of workers. On the other hand, nearly 60 percent of them 
said that they are going to decrease the number of their 
employees. On the question of by what percentage they intend to 
reduce their work forces, we got answers from nine companies. 
While nine companies plan to decrease their work force by less 
than 10 percent, one company plans to decrease its work force by 
30 percent. 
  If major companies promote rationalization, this will affect 
subsidiary companies. It is feared that the domestic employment 
situation will become more serious in the future.

<F P=106> ["News Focus: Yen's Renewed Surge May Threaten Firms' </F>
Restructuring"] 
  [Text] Tokyo, June 26 KYODO -- The renewed strength of the 
yen is likely to obstruct corporate Japan from pushing ahead 
with restructuring prompted in part by the protracted recession 
and in part by persistent appreciation of the yen. 
  Japanese industry views the current rise of the yen as a 
"temporary phenomenon." 
  Corporate Japan appears still confident that the economy 
will 
head for a substantial recovery in the latter half of the 
current fiscal year which started in April. 
  But it is also certain that the dollar's slide to below 100 
yen in New York trading last Tuesday [21 June] chilled business 
and consumer confidence, coming as it did at a time when 
Japanese businesses have started embarking on full-scale 
restructuring. 
  Despite concerted market interventions by the central banks 
of the United States and major European countries late last 
week, the dollar failed to regain strength in New York. 
  The Smokestack Steel Industry in Japan is struggling to 
bolster its structure that has long been vulnerable to foreign 
exchange movements. 
  Hiroshi Saito, chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel 
Federation, says, "The steel industry seems to have hit bottom," 
citing an upturn in crude steel production, higher steel prices 
in international markets and steady growth in exports. 
  On the domestic front as well, the steel industry stands to 
benefit from a fledgling pickup of its main user, the automotive 
industry. 
  "We can compete with our overseas rivals if the yen stays 
around 110 to the dollar," says Reiji Nakato, managing director 
of Kawasaki Steel Corp. 
  There is a danger of the yen's renewed surge putting a drag 
on steel manufacturers' cost-cutting, restructuring efforts, 
however. 
  Says Yoshiro Sasaki, vice president of Nippon Steel Corp., 
"The effect of restructuring will weaken if we fail to achieve 
production targets. Moreover, we're concerned about a possible 
cooling-off in consumer confidence." 
  In order to keep consumer sentiment from cooling, Japan 
needs 
to take measures immediately to pass benefits from a high yen on 
to consumers and rectify its external trade imbalances, he says. 
  In the 1980s, Japanese consumers benefited from a strong yen 
in a limited number of areas, with prices of consumer goods 
remaining high relative to those abroad. 
  The yen's rapid rise was touched off by the 1985 Plaza 
Accord 
reached among finance ministers of the Group of Five (G-5) 
industrial powers. 
  Of late, however, a price gap between Japan and overseas has 
been narrowing. 
  An official of major supermarket operator Seiyu Ltd. says, 
"domestic prices will go down further," expressing a readiness 
to join in efforts to push down prices by taking advantage of 
the yen's appreciation. 
  Meanwhile, electrical machinery and automobile manufacturers 
are stepping up "transplant" production by shifting output to 
their overseas footholds. 
  Toyota Motor Corp. has raised the ratio of overseas 
production to the total output to 40 percent. The largest 
Japanese automaker is to discontinue exports of small trucks to 
the United States next January and churn out such trucks 
entirely in that country. 
  But industry analysts point out that it seems hard for 
lower-ranked car manufacturers to boost overseas operations 
because of weaker financial positions. 
  An auto industry official predicts the yen's unabated 
strength will bring into bold relief the mixed performances of 
automakers. 
  Performance gaps between companies and industries are 
expected to widen for the coming years if the yen stays high.

<F P=106> ["News Focus" by Keiko Tatsuta: "Dollar-Buying Central Bank </F>
Intervention Seen Makeshift] 
  [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- Despite the Bank of 
Japan's efforts to pin the dollar above the 100 yen level, the 
fragile currency finally surrendered the psychological barrier 
during Tokyo trading hours Monday [27 June] for the first time 
since the end of World War II. 
  Even after last Friday's concerted intervention overseas by 
some 16 major central banks, the dollar's weak trend has 
continued. 
  After hitting a new global postwar low of 99.50 yen in 
morning Tokyo trading, the dollar closed Monday at 99.93 yen, 
easily renewing its previous Tokyo closing low of 100.40 yen 
recorded last Friday. 
  The Bank of Japan actively stepped into the market from the 
opening to buy up the dollar for the yen in large amounts, which 
momentarily pushed it up back to 100.30 yen but failed to keep 
it above 100 yen at the closing. 
  The effect of Monday's intervention by the Bank of Japan was 
"so- so," considering the somewhat smaller amount than last 
week, said Kazuo Takayama, foreign exchange director at 
Barclay's Bank. 
  Coordinated central bank intervention, however, could have 
impact only in combination with cooperation on monetary policy, 
Takayama said 
  Washington's stance to defend the dollar was not clear yet 
with the concerted intervention Friday night, Takayama said. 
  Takayama suggested there is a need for the United States to 
raise its key interest rates and for Japan and Germany to lower 
theirs to support the dollar. 
  Considering the dollar's current weakness, vigorous 
concerted 
intervention in may turned out to be ineffective in the long 
run, said Yuko Fukakusa, manager of the treasury division at 
Tokai Bank. 
  Last Friday's coordinated intervention was also futile, or 
otherwise created the best chance for selling, because the 
timing was premature, Fukakusa said. 
  To stop the dollar's further slip, however, intermittent 
central bank intervention may be a must, Fukakusa said. 
  Although another dive in the dollar could be expected from a 
short-term point of view, such intervention may have gradual 
effect to brace the dollar, she said. 
  There is a growing view that the U.S. Federal Reserve Board 
will finally decide to raise its base interest rates to prevent 
the dollar's further drop, market watchers said. 
  A strategist at Daiwa Institute of Research said there is a 
need for U.S. monetary authorities to either abandon the present 
policy of keeping interest rates extremely low, or carry out 
large-scale concerted intervention. 
  He said, however, since the possibility is remote that the 
U.S. will hike interest rates, Japan may be forced to cut its 
official discount rate as an emergency measure. 
  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii told reporters Monday that 
Japan will take "aggressive" action to stem the yen's rise in 
cooperation with the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations. 
  Fujii declined to comment on possible joint G-7 actions on 
credit policies, however, saying, "monetary measures are for the 
central bank to decide." 
  Government officials tried to react calmly but firmly to the 
dollar's fall below 100 yen, with one official saying, "We will 
not make a fuss about the yen's appreciation and remain calm." 
  "Our being upset will adversely affect the exchange rate," 
the official said, while noting that immediate concerted 
intervention is the only way to check the yen's further rise.

  [Text] Former members of the Free Papua Organization [OPM] 
based in several cities in Papua New Guinea have established a 
new organization called the Irian Jaya Development Operation. 
Speaking in Jayapura today, (Joseph Tandu), chief of the 
Information Service of the Indonesian Embassy in Port Moresby, 
said leaders of the new organization had recently invited former 
OPM members still living in the jungle to join the movement. 
The call to join the movement was made because OPM's earlier 
armed struggle and guerrilla warfare against the Indonesian 
authorities along the Irian Jaya-PNG border had proved to be 
unsuccessful. 
  Using the new organization based in Port Moresby, OPM 
leaders 
are now trying to persuade former members who are still living 
in the jungle as well as those who have become PNG citizens to 
assist the Irian Jaya regional administration in carrying out 
development programs. However, (Joseph Tandu) admitted that the 
new organization has no clear objectives and the Indonesian 
Embassy in Port Moresby is uncertain as to what activities the 
new organization has done and will do in the future.

  [Text] Semarang, C. [Central] Java -- The Consultative 
Group on Indonesia (CGI) is expected to provide loans worth 5.1 
billion U.S. dollars to Indonesia this year, Finance Minister 
Mar'ie Muhammad said. 
  The CGI would still discuss the exact amount of loans at its 
meeting to be held in Paris on July 7 and 8, he told reporters 
after addressing a seminar on the Indonesian Tax System for the 
Second Long-Term Development Drive here on Saturday. 
  But he said the amount of loans would not be so much 
different from that of the previous year due to the appreciation 
of Japanese yen against U.S. dollar. 
  The minister said CGl's loans to Indonesia were directed 
towards financing the construction of physical facilities and 
infrastructures, the promotion of women's role, and the 
implementation of a presidential instruction-based backward 
village promotion program. 
  The construction of public utilities would top the list of 
priority in the utilization of the loans, he said adding 
projects which had not been completed in the fifth Five-Year 
Development Plan (Repelita V, 1989/1994) would be completed in 
the Sixth Repelita. 
  He made it clear that some CGI-funded projects would be 
exempted from income tax in accordance with a joint agreement 
signed by Indonesia and CGI member countries. 
  Coordinating Minister for Economy and Finance/Development 
Supervision Saleh Afiff will lead the Indonesian delegation to 
the Paris meeting. 
  The finance minister himself will not attend the meeting 
because he will visit several world important cities on those 
days.

  [Excerpt] Bandung, KOMPAS -- A total of 90 containers of 
imported plastic waste are still lying idle at Tanjungpriok 
Port, Jakarta. The government is currently making continuous 
efforts to ship the containers back to the Netherlands -- their 
country of origin. 
  Minister of State for Environment, Ir. [academic title] 
Sarwono Kusumaatmaja stated this to the press in Bandung on 
Wednesday 15 June. According to the minister, the government is 
facing difficulties in trying to ship back the plastic waste 
because the containers were smuggled into the country. The 
Netherlands Government considered that it was not responsible 
for the existence of the plastic waste in Indonesia. 
  Continuing, Minister Sarwono said the Netherlands Government 
will accept the waste only if an official decision was endorsed 
by the Netherlands Supreme Court. The court is currently 
attending to the case in question. He said,"We hope that the 
Netherlands Supreme Court makes an endorsement to take back the 
plastic waste to the country." 
  The minister went on to say that should the Netherlands 
Supreme Court refuse to accept the plastic waste, then Indonesia 
will take alternative measures for the waste to be returned to 
the country. Minister Sarwono said,"We will make our move 
through political, diplomatic, and legal channels in the 
International Court." 
  The minister also stated that the imported plastic waste had 
probably entered the country through certain Dutch exporters who 
had exploited the facilities afforded to them by the 
authorities. However, the plastic waste could not have entered 
Indonesia without the involvement of some local importers. 
  Sarwono said, "As a result of this, the North Jakarta High 
Court is pursuing the case against two local industries that 
imported the plastic waste." 
  He said, moreover, the continuing presence of the 90 
containers of plastic waste at Tanjungpriok Port effected a loss 
in income by the port because the area could not be leased out 
to other companies. Apart from this, the whole location and 
environment is subjected to the danger of being exposed to the 
poisonous toxic substance. 
  Minister Sarwono explained, "Therefore, the loss in income 
suffered by the port authorities will be included in the claim 
when it is served on the Dutch and Indonesian industries."

  [Text] Jakarta, Jun 25 (ANTARA) -- It is now time to allow 
100 percent foreign ownership of shares in Indonesia's stock 
exchange following a ruling stipulating that foreign investors 
are allowed to control 100 percent of the shares in companies 
set up under a foreign investment scheme, a senior stock 
exchange director has said. 
  "It is my hope that portfolio shares can also be 100 percent 
controlled by foreigners," president director of Jakarta Stock 
Exchange Hasan Zein Mahmud told ANTARA during a break in a 
gathering organized by WARTA EKONOMI [ECONOMIC NEWS] Business 
Club here Friday. 
  Malaysia, he said, has proved that such a practice can also 
benefit domestic investors provided that certain rulings are 
issued to regulate it. 
  "In Malaysia, 100 percent foreign ownership of shares in a 
stock exchange is allowed only in the secondary market. In the 
primary market this is subjected to certain limitation. This 
practice is profitable to domestic investors because they have a 
greater chance to buy primary shares at a lower price to be sold 
later in the secondary market at a higher price," he explained. 
  Replying to a question whether or not 100 percent ownership 
of shares in a stock exchange will lead to foreign investors 
taking over the share issuers, he maintained that this is 
unlikely to occur provided that certain limitation rulings are 
effected in this respect. 
  "This is an unnecessary worry because a capital market 
ruling 
can, for example, stipulate that although foreign investors may 
control 100 percent of shares in stock exchange, foreign 
participation in managerial matters should remain limited to 49 
percent. As such a ruling is common in other countries, why 
can't Indonesia follow suit?" he said. 
  He added that this ruling will not disadvantage foreign 
investors as other commercially profitable rights such as 
dividend, right issue, and bonus share rights will remain theirs. 
  In the meantime, in his lecture on the occasion entitled 
"The Concept of the Development of Jakarta Stock Exchange 
(JSX)" he expressed his optimism that market capitalization of 
JSX in 1994 may reach some rp [Rupiah] 100 trillion, up from rp 
69.3 trillion registered in 1993. 
  He said this estimate was based on three factors, namely, 
the 
large number of new issuers entering JSX, the expansion of many 
old issuers at JSX and steady increase of share prices.

  [Text] Jakarta -- Indonesian security forces have detained 
13 people belonging to a clandestine extremist Islamic group 
said to be responsible for circulating leaflets aimed at 
stirring unrest and divisions in the country. 
  It is believed the leaflets in question were those 
circulated 
here and in several major cities across the country earlier this 
month. They called for an uprising against minority 
ethnic-Chinese Indonesians who have been criticised for their 
dominant role in business and for controlling the economy. 
  The armed forces daily, ANGKATAN BERSENJATA, in a front-page 
report yesterday, did not make reference to the specific 
contents of the leaflets. 
  But the report said the little-known Kelompok Islam 
Indonesia 
(Indonesian Islam Group) sought to incite people into 
undertaking activities which would split national unity and the 
country. 
  It said that the 13 members of the group were captured on 
Thursday at a house in West Jakarta and added that the military 
had been monitoring their activities for some time. 
  West Jakarta District Military Commander Lieutenant Colonel 
I.P. Wisworo said the group attempted to put up a fight but 
surrendered after their leader, identified as 23 year-old Mus, 
was "incapacitated" by security forces. 
  No other details of the operation were publicised and Lt. 
Col. Wisworo himself was not available for further comment 
yesterday. 
  ANGKATAN BERSENJATA said the leaflets related to SARA issues 
-- the acronym used here to refer to the sensitive and, if 
exploited, potentially explosive issues of ethnicity, religion, 
race and differences between groups of any kind. 
  The government of ethnically diverse Indonesia has adopted a 
hardline attitude towards individuals and groups which exploit 
SARA issues to heighten political and social tension. 
  Although nearly 90 percent of Indonesia's more than 
185-million-strong population are Muslim, President Suharto and 
the military in particular have reacted strongly to counter and 
act against anyone with intentions of turning the country into 
an Islamic state. 
  The question of the ethnic Chinese Indonesians' stake in the 
economy has often been made an issue by politicians, business, 
and interest groups who feel that the indigenous majority -- 25 
million of whom live below the poverty line -- has not received 
an equitable share of opportunities. 
  Indonesia's five million ethnic-Chinese community is 
estimated to control anywhere from 50 to 60 percent of the 
economy. 
  The leaflets, which focused on the issue of dominance and 
accused the Chinese of disadvantaging other Indonesians, 
resulted in rumours about unrest and caused unease among the 
ethnic-Chinesc community and others here. 
  Lt. Col. Wisworo reiterated the government's long-standing 
call to Indonesians not to be influenced and caught up by the 
sentiments expressed in the leaflets and said the population 
could help by reporting such issues to the security forces.

  [Excerpt] Ujungpandang, KOMPAS -- The Indonesian Air Force 
will soon procure some new 100 and 200 Hawk fighter aircraft as 
part of its program to upgrade its weaponry system. The 
procurement of the additional new fighter aircraft is to further 
strengthen the air force. This is in line with its program, 
which anticipates heavier responsibilities in the future during 
the second 25-year long-term development program, PJPT II [Roman 
two]. 
  Air Marshall Rilo Pembudi, chief of staff of the Indonesian 
Air Force, disclosed this on 15 June when he delivered an 
address marking the 43d founding anniversary of the Air Force 
Operational Command at the Galaktika Apron of the Lanud 
Hasanuddin Indonesian Air Force base in Ujungpandang. 
  Air Marshall Rilo did not disclose the number of aircraft 
the 
air force will procure. Instead, he urged that necessary 
preparations should be made to accomodate the fighter aircraft 
when they finally arrive. All the necessary facilities such as 
hangars, workshops, operational needs, including the ground 
crew, should be maade readily available when the aircraft 
arrive. He said: "Apart from this, the air force will continue 
with its program to fully utilize all the existing weaponry and 
equipment to their maximum operational capability." [Passage

<F P=106> [Unsigned editorial: "Boosting Small Businesses"] </F>
  [Text] The process of making concrete the commitment to 
boost small and medium-sized businesses in Indonesia will 
continue. In its Technical Working Meeting at Cipayung, Bogor, 
the Functional Group [GOLKAR] proposed the establishment of a 
guaranty board and a loan fund ("guarantee fund") to channel 
bank credit to small and medium-sized businesses. The largest of 
the sociopolitical organizations also proposed that from 1 to 5 
percent of the profits of state-owned businesses be set aside 
for small businesses and cooperatives. 
  Naturally, this is good news for small and medium-sized 
businesses, which encompass about 34.4 million adults. GOLKAR's 
proposal represents a further concrete commitment to help small 
and medium-sized businesses. The proposal is probably not a 
coincidence and represents another of the steps taken by the 
government to strengthen the status of small and medium-sized 
businesses in the country. 
  GOLKAR clearly was also awakened by the fact this these 
groups needing help are still having problems in getting credit 
from banks. Bank credits flow more easily to big businesses. 
  In a seminar in Jakarta at the end of April, which was 
attended by operators of about a thousand small and medium-sized 
businesses throughout the country, complaints were heard about 
the stiff requirements imposed by banks. The businessmen feel 
they are treated as stepchildren, and they recognize the fact 
that bank credits flow more smoothly to big businesses. GOLKAR 
possibly was motivated by hearing those grievances. 
  The government views small and medium-sized businesses as 
strategic groups. Through them, the government is expanding 
prosperity. These groups have special features. For example, 
they absorb large numbers of workers. Furthermore, they adapt 
better to economic recession than the big businesses owned by 
the "big shot" industrialists. They also more easily act as 
subcontractors to big businesses. 
  For the takeoff phase, the government apparently is not 
depending only on big businesses but is counting on the role of 
small and medium-sized businesses. In some countries, there is 
controversy about who will be relied upon for the takeoff phase: 
Will it be big business only, or will small businesses be 
involved, too? In Indonesia, the government sees the role of 
small and medium-sized businesses as important. 
  The government has taken a variety of steps to boost these 
groups. One of the steps was Presidential Decision No. 16/1994, 
which gave them opportunities for access to markets. It says 
that about 10 percent of the total value of government 
expenditures will be used to buy products from small-and 
medium-scale businesses. Total government expenditures are now 
estimated at 20 trillion rupiah. When this provision is carried 
out, these groups will be truly helped. 
  Many countries have in fact established special institutions 
to channel credits to small and medium-sized businesses. 
Thailand, for example, has long had such an institution, and the 
results have been very satisfying. In other words, credit is 
obtained more smoothly by small businesses, without anyone 
exercising any effort to make it difficult. 
  The recent reports of unpaid loans on the part of big 
businesses should open our eyes to the fact that big businesses 
do not always repay bank credits promptly. As far as we have 
observed, one of the reasons banks are reluctant to extend 
credit to small and medium-sized businesses is the assumption 
that big businesses, because of their strong capital positions, 
will more quickly repay the credits they obtain. Action against 
big businesses that abuse credit is a must, but it would be wise 
for us to use the moment to realize again the strategic role 
played by small and medium-sized businesses. 
  In this connection, the words that Minister of Finance 
Mari'e 
Muhammad spoke at the GOLKAR technical working meeting at 
Cipayung are very relevant, namely that it would be 
"unthinkable" for the government to continue to give protection 
to big businesses. The minister of finance said, however, that 
it would be "objectionable" for small and medium-sized 
businesses to be given unlimited protection. 
  The position of taking the side of the small and weak is a 
humanitarian law of ethics. To take the side of small and 
medium-sized businesses does not mean ostracizing big 
businesses. The sociological reality that the small constitute 
the largest group is a strong reason for taking their side. We 
welcome GOLKAR's determination to take concrete action to 
strengthen small and medium-sized businesses in Indonesia.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Need for a Breakthrough in the Textile </F>
Trade"] 
  [Text] The second round of bilateral textile negotiations 
between Indonesia and the United States in Bali from 9 to 12 
June ended without an agreement on the export quota. The 
Indonesian negotiating team felt that the U.S team led by Caroyl 
Miller, did not seem to be serious about maintaining mutually 
beneficial political and business ties. 
  Halida Milyani, secretary of the Directorate General of 
Foreign Trade who led the Indonesian negotiating team, said that 
Indonesia had met the U.S. demands for a tougher circumvention 
ruling regarding the diversion of the Indonesian quota to other 
exporting countries. But, she said, the U.S. delegation did not 
return the favor of Indonesian concessions. 
  Without taking into account the fair or unfair attitude 
demonstrated by the U.S. team during the negotiations, we have 
to admit that Indonesia is in a vulnerable position because 
Indonesia is the party that needs a wider market in the United 
States for its textile products. We should take lessons from 
our past experience, knowing that the importing countries, like 
the United States and the EC, always have stronger bargaining 
power. 
  The uncompromising stance maintained by the U.S. team made 
the Indonesian negotiating team feel rather emotional. It is 
likely that later on, several associations of textiles and 
textile products in Indonesia will say that there is no need for 
us to make too many sacrifices just for the sake of business 
interest at the expense of our self-respect and national 
interests. 
  It has long been noticeable for a long time that Indonesia 
does not derive huge profits from the international textile 
market. We know that the time will come when the government has 
to make a breakthrough into the markets that do away with quota 
restrictions. It has been anticipated that it will be more 
difficult to sustain the quota system considering that the 
United States and the EC are inclined to be more protectionist 
although they have often come out for a free world trade order 
without tariff and non-tariff barriers in GATT talks. The EC 
has imposed the export quota on textiles and textile products 
such as yarn and jackets from Indonesia since 1992. 
  As we already know, the textile and apparel trade between 
the 
consumer and producer countries is regulated by the Multifiber 
Arrangement [preceding three words in English] [MFA]. The MFA 
contains the order on quota restrictions for textiles and 
textile products accorded to producing countries under bilateral 
agreements and the exports quota system. 
  Indonesia, which has been relying on the quota arrangements 
to export its textiles and textile products to the international 
market, has been spared from free competition on the one hand, 
but on the other hand, the quota restriction system may result 
in our textiles and textile products being complacent in the 
superficially secured market. At the same time, this creates 
the tendency for us to depend on the market mechanism of 
importing countries that are bound by the MFA. Actually, the 
MFA is not stable because it is influenced by many factors such 
as the desire of major importing countries to protect their 
domestic industries and the stiff competition among developing 
countries to vie for the exports quota. The competition will 
become more serious when all developing countries that rely on 
the quota arrangements use the cheap labor force as a 
comparative edge. 
  Besides, there is a need for strong lobbying and conclusive 
negotiations with the importing countries to secure the export 
quota. Regarding the lobbying tactics, Indonesia has been 
considered behind the PRC, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Malaysia. 
  This was evident in the call by economic observers on the 
Indonesian negotiating team to conduct more aggressive 
negotiations with foreigners. There is no reason for Indonesia 
to receive a much lower quota for its textiles and textile 
products compared to that accorded to the PRC. According to the 
data from MFA, the PRC receives a 13.5 percent exports quota for 
its textile and textile products, while Indonesia receives only 
2.8 percent. Thus, we are puzzled over this. When compared to 
the quotas accorded to other developing countries, the quota 
received by Indonesia is much lower than that given to India 
(4.3 percent), and Thailand (4.1 percent). 
  Considering that Indonesia's textiles have now become the 
country's largest nonoil and nongas commodity exports, the time 
has come for us to seek an alternative market for them. We need 
to think wisely and implement a prudent policy to face the 
fluctuations of markets for textiles and textile products. 
According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, 2.45 million job 
seekers were absorbed into the textile and garment industries in 
the beginning of the Fourth Five-Year Development Plan (1985). 
They made up 29 percent of the total 8.5 million workers in the 
industrial sector.

  [Text] Jakarta, Jun 26 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- The Agriculture 
Ministry's Director General of Food Crops Amrin Kahar said that 
drought besetting certain areas in Indonesia was expected to 
cause the national rice production to decrease by 2.7 percent of 
48 million tons total production last year. 
  "Drought besetting several areas of the country is difficult 
to predict as it has deviated from the long dry cycle," he told 
the press after attending the opening ceremony of the sport week 
to mark the Ministry's hari krida pertanian (outdoor activity 
day). 
  The five year cycle of long dry season occured in 1972, 
1977, 
1982, and in 1987. It was predicted that 1992 would see a long 
dry season but it did not and even in that year the rice 
production increased by 7.8 percent from 47.5 million tons in 
the previous year. 
  Drought is expected to plague hundreds of hectare rice 
fields 
in the Central Java cities of Wonogiri, Sragen, Cilacap, Demak 
and in West Java cities of Indramayu, Cirebon and Bandung which 
are all regarded as the breadbaskets. 
  Amrin proposed that farmers in the areas which are short of 
water after rainy season should resort to planting crops which 
need less water, such as corn and soybean. 
  The drought, however, will not threaten the Indonesia's 
existing self-sufficiency in rice. 
  "Indonesia's rice production is still much bigger than that 
of consumption. Besides, several neighbouring countries which 
borrow Indonesia's rice will in the near future repay it so that 
it can be used to secure the rice self-sufficiency," he said.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The national rice production, which is facing a 
slight problem due to drought in several areas in Java, was the 
topic of discussion that Ibrahim Hassan, state minister for food 
affairs and chairman of the National Logistics Agency, gave to 
members of parliament's Commission III. Currently, the 
nationwide rice stock stands at 850,000 tonnes, while in 
previous years, it stood at between 1.4 and 1.5 million tonnes. 
However, people are urged not to be alarmed because as many as 
650,000 tonnes of rice loaned to several friendly countries will 
be returned to Indonesia. The Philippines and Cuba will each 
return 200,000 tonnes of rice to us. 
  Whether we admit it or not, agriculture is a complicated and 
fundamental issue for us. While farmers play an important role 
in supporting development and national stability, it is not easy 
for them to produce food due to the vagaries of nature, such as 
pests, long droughts, and floods as well as a limited area of 
cultivation. 
  Some people have even blamed the food-producing subsector as 
a source of inefficiency or unemployment demanding our special 
attention in our efforts to combat poverty. What is strange is 
that the economically weak farmers seem to subsidize the 
industrial sector and other members of the society with stronger 
economic clout. 
  In this connection, (Jurgen Habbermash) may be correct when 
he said that human interaction based on professional interest 
only is basically wrong. He cited the example of Karl Marx, who 
failed to understand that human interaction was based on the 
need of human beings to communicate; because of this, Marx also 
failed to realize his dream, namely, to liberate the oppressed 
people. 
  This being so, it is obvious that the Indonesian 
archipelagic 
concept and its basic principles should be popularized and 
translated into action for the sake of national development 
because all development sectors are equally important; all 
scientific disciplines have equal potential; and all fields of 
work have equal status. 
  No government of any country in this world dare scrap the 
agricultural sector, even if its industrial sector is highly 
developed. This shows that agriculture is one of the important 
ways to maintain and safeguard the survival of an independent, 
united, and sovereign nation among other nations.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Intensive Lobbying is Needed in U.S.- </F>
Indonesia Textiles Talks"] 
  [Text] The bilateral U.S.-Indonesia textiles talks in Bali 
concluded in failure, the second time that the talks have 
collapsed. The first meeting in Washington also failed to 
achieve any positive results. 
  The United States will definitely reject Indonesia's request 
for a 14 percent increase for its textiles and textile products 
export quota to the U.S.. It was only willing to grant a two 
percent increase. Indonesia, however, rejected the offer. 
Meanwhile, no concrete decision was reached in connection with 
the U.S. request for wider access to Indonesian markets for its 
products because of conflicting and disputed opinions. It 
warned that it would impose sanctions against any country which 
absorbs or circumvents the quota provided to Indonesian textile 
producers. 
  The warning still remains effective even though Indonesia 
was 
submissive in reducing its import tariffs on U.S. products, 
together with its compliance to reconsider the issue of 
circumvention [preceding word in English] and cooperation in 
cases where another country sends textile exports to the United 
States under the export quota. 
  Newspapers carried reports on reaction to the failed talks 
-- 
ranging from anger and disappointment to rational agruments. 
Indonesia was frustrated by the methods employed in the Bali 
talks. In fact, everyone anticipated that the talks would end in 
failure. Some Indonesian textile producers stated to the press 
last month that they expected the textile talks to fail after 
noting their previous lobbying efforts in Washington. 
  Further talks will collapse if Indonesia does not concretely 
provide certain "concessions" to the United States in connection 
with its request for wider access for its products in Indonesian 
markets, coupled with Indonesia's agreement regarding the issue 
of circumvention. These two issues were brought up during the 
first round of talks in Washington. 
  It can be surmised what ensued after the talks. 
  According to our observations, Indonesia was a bit confused 
over certain issues. The United States Trade Representative 
(USTR) delegation was headed by one of its deputies, Carol 
Miller, a new member to the team. Thus, the assumption that the 
new team would speedily deal with the existing problems and 
grant Indonesia concessions because the meeting was held in 
idyllic Bali, a tourist haven, left Indonesia confounded. 
  The team came to Bali for the meeting equipped with specific 
"trends" set by the USTR in Washington. Should Indonesia find 
the concession "card" provided to it unacceptable, then the USTR 
would revert to the guidelines laid down by Washington. The 
concessions, which provided for a two percent increase over the 
previous quota, was given only at the eleventh hour. 
  Besides, the USTR team arrived for an official business 
meeting. A tit for tat [preceding phrase in English]. I will 
only give you something if you give me something in return. The 
USTR team does not take into consideration any clarification on 
national development or argumments concerning advocation of the 
nation's and people's interests when dealing with the issue of a 
possible increase in the existing textiles export quota. 
  It would be more justifiable if we could convince the United 
States that Indonesia's textiles export is the major mechanism 
in warranting the country's economic growth -- the primary 
source of non-gas exports, which could provide numerous 
employment opportunities. 
  The Indonesian delegation sought an increase for the 
textiles 
export quota for only certain categories during the first round 
of talks in Washington. The USTR side viewed the request as 
solely coming from Indonesian authorities and based on the 
country's performance with the export quota, beginning with the 
process of distribution until it reached the final destination 
in the United States. All this data is in the hands of the 
USTR, including the dealings conducted on the quota and the 
benefit procured by bureaucrats. One issue which the United 
States disagreed on for granting an increase in the textile 
export quota was an expansion of textiles and textile products 
industries in the Third World. The United states had similarly 
asked for such concessions for its industries. 
  The USTR delegations's talks with the Indonesian side was 
definitely based on certain flexibilities and with a give and 
take [preceding three words in English] attitude. It should be 
acknowledged that such flexibilities were afforded through 
intensive lobbying by the Indonesian side. 
  Lobbying was carried out simultaneously while the Indonesian 
delegation was attending the negotiations. The Indonesian 
textile producers stated that the lobbying, however, was a bit 
too late. That was the reason the USTR delegation had to follow 
certain "trends" laid down by Washington during the Bali talks. 
  Lobbying was previously conducted to ascertain how seriously 
Indonesia's request for an increased quota would be taken by the 
United States and its demand for concessions for its products to 
enter the Indonesian market. The Indonesian Government stands 
to benefit from the business circle which has long-standing 
personal ties and lobbying access with their U.S. counterparts. 
Their influence will not only gain access to the USTR, but also 
to the U.S. Senate, the House of Representatives, the State 
Department, The Trade Department, the Agriculture Department, 
and the Inland Revenue Department -- apart from the American 
business circle's assistance in the lobbying. Our country has a 
number of influential businessmen with such capability and 
Indonesia could have seized on the opportunity before the talks 
commenced in Bali. 
  Therefore, the success of the bilateral talks cannot be 
assured through formal and businesslike [preceding word in 
English] talks at the negotiating table, unless the negotiations 
are carried out in an informal manner with a personal 
relationship. Indonesia can achieve its expectations only 
through this method. This was done during the 1989 
U.S.-Indonesia bilateral talks on textile trade in Bali. 
  As such, the opinion of Dr. Mari Pengestu, an Indonesian 
economist, is considered convincing as he has proposed that the 
country embark on an early lobbying process before the next 
round of talks and prior to the expiration of the U.S. textile 
quota for Indonesia, which ends on 30 June. 
  Finally, should there be a third round of talks, Indonesia 
needs to field a more effective negotiating team which will be 
as equally effective as the USTR team. In the structure of the 
U.S. administration, the USTR is a body directly under 
presidential jurisdiction and its chief executive official's 
status is equivalent to that of a minister. Besides, the USTR 
has more jurisdiction than the U.S. Trade Department. Apart 
from this, the Indonesian delegation could also incorporate 
itself with the business circle which conducts lobbying with the 
United States. The business circle is much respected by the 
U.S. due to its long-standing personal relations with the 
Americans who effect their influence through negotiations. All 
this is necessary for the sake of achieving a successful outcome 
for the talks, which will be mutually beneficial for the United 
States and Indonesia.

  [Text] Australia's Prime Minister Paul Keating and 
Indonesia's President Suharto, have held talks in Jakarta. 
Although the talks were mainly on trade, Mr. Keating is under 
pressure to raise the issue of Indonesia's recent media clamp 
down during his discussions. 
  The Australian Government has already expected 
disappointment 
about last week banning of Indonesia's three leading news 
magazines. Mr. Keating did not commit himself to raising the 
sensitive issue with President Suharto. Before leaving 
Canberra, Mr. Keating said that Australia was not about to 
become an international media policeman.

  [Excerpt] Jakarta, June 28 (AFP) -- Australian Prime 
Minister Paul Keating Tuesday told President Suharto he was 
disappointed at the banning in Indonesia of three popular 
publications whose closure provoked numerous protests and a 
severe police crackdown. 
  Keating -- whose comments came as 21 people went on trial 
for 
protesting the ban -- said the press closures "appear to 
conflict or at least contrast with the openness which generally 
occurs in the Indonesian (?economy)." 
  Keating said at a press conference after meeting Indonesian 
President Suharto that he had been asked to understand Jakarta's 
point of view. 
  Suharto said it was "very important" to maintain "stability 
and national unity at this time of great economic growth and 
transformation, that these things were to be taken as given in 
the society," Keating said. 
  "Journalists in question had put some of these things -- 
that's national unity and stability -- at risk," Keating quoted 
Suharto as saying. [passage omitted]

  [Text] [Announcer] Australia's prime minister, Paul 
Keating, has raised concerns about Indonesia's clampdown on the 
media in talks with President Suharto in Jakarta. During a 
two-hour meeting at the presidential palace in Jakarta, Mr. 
Keating repeated Australia's disappointment with last week's 
closure of Indonesia's three leading weekly news magazines. 
Michael Maher reports: 
  [Maher] In telling President Suharto that the Australian 
government was disappointed with the media bans, Mr. Keating 
pointed out that the magazine closures appeared to conflict with 
the openness which has occurred in the Indonesian economy. 
According to the Prime Minister, President Suharto took those 
remarks seriously and then replied that the banned magazines had 
put national unity and stability at risk. Mr. Keating said the 
matter wasn't pursued further in a two-hour meeting which dealt 
mainly with trade and issues related to the forthcoming 
Asia-Pacific economic forum leaders' summit in Indonesia. While 
demonstrators had threatened to stage more protests against the 
media clampdown during Mr. Keating's stay, there was little sign 
of such activity on the streets of the capital. 
  [Announcer] Up to 21 demonstrators arrested yesterday are to 
appear today in the Central Jakarta District Court. They were 
detained when riot police broke up a demonstration against the 
banning of three Indonesian weekly magazines. A court official 
says there will be three separate hearings for the demonstrators 
who include the prominent poet Brendra. Indonesia's leading 
human rights group, the Legal Aid Foundation, says the 21 
demonstrators are considered to have committed minor offenses 
under the law and could be dealt with summarily.

  [Excerpt] Jakarta, KOMPAS -- There are numerous 
opportunities for Indonesian businessmen in Myanmar [Burma] in 
several sectors, particularly in the investment and services 
sectors. Indonesia House has been established in an effort to 
coordinate such an effort. It is a forum that acts as a 
facilitator for Indonesian businessmen who wish to invest and 
conduct business in Myanmar. 
  This was stated by Communications Minister Haryanto 
Dhanutirto, after he, Coordinating Minister for Industry 
Hartarto and Joop Ave, Minister of Tourism, Posts, and 
Telecommunications presented their reports on their recent visit 
to Myanmar to President Suharto at Merdeka Palace on 15 June. He 
clarified that the Burmese officials reflected a positive 
attitude regarding the interest shown by Indonesian businessmen 
to conduct business activities in Myanmar. They gave priority to 
such an issue. 
  According to the communications minister, Indonesia House is 
headed by Hutomo Mandala Putra (known as Tommy Suharto). An 
office has been set up in Myanmar as an effort to facilitate all 
matters pertaining to investments in Myanmar. 
  The communications minister said, "Indonesia House is 
getting 
serious attention from the Government of Myanmar. This was 
indicated through the authorities' appointment of its national 
development planning board chief as the partner for Indonesia 
House." 
  According to the communications minister, Indonesia House 
coordinates several business groups, such as the business groups 
on forest industry, industries, trade, design and construction 
and tourism. 
  One of the most promising sectors of cooperation lies in the 
forest industries because 53 percent of Myanmar is covered with 
forests. Indonesia is currently a producer of plywood. The 
country hopes that its markets will be perpetually secured and 
safe as a result of the cooperation with Myanmar. 
  Apart from this, there is also bilateral trade cooperation 
in 
the cashew nut business. Indonesian traders are involved in 
about 43 percent of the cashew nut trade. The country hopes to 
capture a greater segment of the global trade through this 
bilateral trade cooperation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Philippines and other Southeast Asian [SEA] 
countries have initiated efforts to create a powerful "think 
tank" in the Asia-Pacific region, National Security adviser Jose 
Almonte said last weekend . 
  Almonte said a "building block" composed of government and 
private individuals from ASEAN and four Indo-China nations was 
formed to formulate goals and guidelines which will be presented 
to their respective heads of state for approval. 
  He made the announcement during a dinner in honor of the 
Philippine National Police hosted by the host committee of the 
Miss Universe beauty pageant at the Shangri-La Hotel in Makati 
Saturday night. 
  Almonte said the group formally met 30 and 31 May in Manila 
and another meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia last week. 
  The group is composed of 21 government officials, 
politicians, diplomats, college professors and technocrats from 
the Philippines, Malaysia, Australia, Vietnam, Indonesia, 
Myanmar [Burma], Cambodia, Thailand and Laos. 
  "The main goal of the group is to advise our respective 
governments on how to strive to become a major force in the 
Asia-Pacific region and later be worthy as a building block of a 
global community, Almonte said. 
  He said the think tank that includes non-members of the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations will tackle not only 
regional security and economic development but also mutual 
respect for each country's internal affairs with respect to the 
dignity of every person. 
  "The group envisions a regional community, not patterned 
after the European Economic Community, but a new model of 
international cooperation based on the principles of peace, 
prosperity and justice with respect to individual rights," 
Almonte said. 
  Almonte said the members of the think tank include people 
with a common vision of a borderless Southeast Asia. 
  He said one of the initial proposals of the group are the 
holding of a SEA Summit as soon as possible to decide formally 
on the projected creation of more cohesive SEA cooperation. 
  Another proposed project is the creation of the SEA 
Development Corporation to boost economic development and 
management skills in the region.

  [Text] The health ministers of Cambodia Laos, Vietnam, and 
Thailand yesterday signed a joint statement to better tackle 
regional health problems. 
  The statement, issued on the last day of a two-day 
ministerial meeting in Phatthaya on Regional Cooperation in 
Health Development, ignores political boundaries. 
  It would be enforced after official acknowledgment from the 
four countries' cabinets. 
  The statement was signed by Public Health Minister Athit 
Urairat, Cambodian Health Minister Chhea Thang, Lao Vice-Health 
Minister Bounkhouang Phichit and Vietnamese Health Minister 
Nguyen Trong Nhan. 
  The ministers said they were committed to eradicating and 
resolving priority health problems of common concern. 
  Each country was determined to fight against sub-regional 
priority health problems through balanced, comprehensive and 
multidisciplinary approaches, they said. 
  They promised to undertake collective action to tackle 
problems including HIV/AIDS, malaria, iodine deficiency 
disorders, substance abuse, poliomyelitis and other epidemic 
diseases. 
  Planning and management coordinating bodies would be formed 
at local and national levels. 
  New departments would aim to introduce action programs and 
would adopt policies, programs and strategies to achieve a more 
coordinated control of health problems. 
  Ministers also called on the international community to 
offer 
concrete technical and financial assistance to new collaborative 
programmes. 
  The meeting focused on five major common communicable 
diseases in neighbouring countries--HIV/AIDS, malaria, polio, 
substance abuse and iodine deficiency. 
  Dr. Athit, in his closing remarks, said it was time to 
change 
the "days of discussion" into action. 
  "We found that we are ready to invest for our future--the 
children and women," he said. 
  "And we also wanted to be better prepared for any emerging 
health threat. AIDS and substance abuse is a case to test our 
readiness."

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, June 28./OANA-MONTSAME/. The 
newspaper "ARDYN TOR" informs that the State Great Hural /SGH/ 
spring session has finished consideration of the draft law on 
territories which are under the state special protection in the 
first reading. During discussion of the draft law the 
parliament members have paid great attention to drawing the law 
nearer to the generally accepted world standards, paying 
great attention to classification of territories which should 
be under the state protection, to observation of requirements of 
nature and environment protection . The session has returned the 
draft law on property in land for further elaboration to the 
standing committee on protection of nature and environment. As 
the newspaper informs, the SGH session has adopted a resolution 
on measures connected with making additions and amendments in 
the law on administrative-territorial units and their governing. 
  The newspaper publishes an information about staying in the 
country of the parliament delegation of the Kingdom of Thailand 
headed by the president of the Senate M. Ruchupan. As the 
newspaper informs, the parliament delegation of Thailand held 
negotiations with the chairman of the State Great Hural N. 
Bagabandi on the issues of mutual cooperation of parliaments of 
the two countries. 
  The newspaper carries recommendations of the second national 
conference "For Normal Childbirth". The conference was 
organized by the Ministry of Health jointly with the UN Fund for 
Population Activities and the World Health Organization. The 
recommendations concern creation of conditions for normal 
childbirth of pregnant women, protection of health of newly-born 
child, family planning. 
  On the eve of the national holiday Naadam, which according 
to the tradition is celebrated in the days of celebration of 
the anniversary of the people's revolution of 1921, the 
newspaper publishes an interview with the well-known wrestlers 
P. Sukhbat, T. Bayarsaihan, holders of the title "Elephant". 
The most probable winner of the coming national wrestling 
tournament, as they consider, is "Giant" B. Baterdene, who is a 
constant winner of the biggest tournaments of the last years. 
The newspaper notes that in 1994 68 wrestlers will participate 
in the national wrestling tournament. 
  The Mongolian trade union newspaper "HODOLMOR" devotes its 
last issue to the best publications of Mongolian and foreign 
press. The newspaper publishes a material of journalist G. 
Jamyanbn, which was published earlier in the newspaper of the 
Mongolian capital "ULAANBAATAR". In this article the journalist 
writes about changes and reforms taken place in the country 
since March 1990. In the journalist's view many 
representatives of the former authoritative regime have 
preserved their positions or have taken the opportunity to 
become rich during privatization of property. As the 
journalist considers, also representatives of democratic forces 
are doing the same. 
  The newspaper republishes an article from the Belgian 
newspaper "AM-WOOB". The author of the publication German 
journalist Z. Waife shares his impressions about his colleagues 
who studied in their [word indistinct] the Moscow High Party 
School, in particular, about the Mongolian journalist L. 
Purevdorj. Holding earlier high posts at the Defence Ministry 
and getting the rank of general, now he has become the 
Democratic Party member, notes the German journalist. In his 
view, L. Purevdorj should not be blamed for quitting the 
Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, what has become an 
ordinary thing in the former so called socialist countries.

<F P=106> [Speech by Chea Sim, acting head of state and chairman of </F>
National Assembly and of the Cambodian People's Party Central 
committee, at a ceremony to mark the party's 43d founding 
anniversary held on 28 June at the party's office in Phnom Penh 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] My respects to the Supreme Patriarchs and all 
venerable monks; my respects to all beloved samdechs, princes, 
excellencies, ladies, and gentlemen; my respects to their 
excellencies representing the embassies and international 
organizations; my respects to all beloved and distinguished 
guests: 
  This is an auspicious day for us to get together to mark the 
43d founding anniversary of the Cambodian People's Party [CPP], 
at a time when our beloved land of Angkor is entering a new 
historic period. This is a period where the CPP and the various 
political forces pledge jointly and resolutely to defend their 
independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity and rebuild 
Cambodia toward a glorious future. At the same time, the 
Cambodian people nationwide and the international community have 
paid and are paying keen attention to the efforts of the 
government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, as it braves all big and 
small obstacles in all areas, political, military, public order, 
economic, and social affairs, to rebuild Cambodia. 
  On this excellent occasion, on behalf of the CPP, I would 
like to extend best wishes to His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk 
Varaman. May His Majesty recover from illness quickly so as to 
speedily return to the motherland and may he enjoy a long life 
of over 100 years so as to continue being the cool shade for his 
children, grand children, and great-grandchildren. May Her 
Majesty Queen Norodom Monineat Sihanouk enjoy the five blessings 
of Lord Buddha on her 58th birthday. 
  Also from this podium, I would like to most sincerely thank 
all venerable monks, CPP members, and beloved compatriots for 
all their sacrifices for the cause of the nation and people. At 
the same time, I bow my head in homage to the souls of millions 
of our people who lost their lives in a most pitiful manner 
under the genocidal regime and to the souls of those killed in 
preventing the return of this regime. May all those souls rest 
in peace. I also beg those souls to help the Cambodian people 
in their efforts for peace and survival. 
  Beloved samdechs, princes, excellencies, ladies, and 
gentlemen, in the past 43 years, the CPP has valiantly gone 
through historic stages of struggle and a thousand and one 
difficulties and achieved many big victories in Cambodian 
history. 
  Looking back on CPP's record, all of us will never forget 
that from the day it was born to the present, the CPP has always 
adhered firmly to its ideals of standing with the people, 
sharing their weal and woe, and maintaining close links with 
them in all circumstances in order to serve the supreme interest 
of the people and nation, and defend national independence, 
territorial integrity, and culture. 
  For example, for three years, eight months, and 20 days the 
country was plunged in the peril caused by the Pol Pot genocidal 
regime -- the most cruel and barbarous in the history of 
Cambodia and mankind. During this time, the CPP was the only 
party that dared to rise up and struggle and make lofty 
sacrifices against this wicked regime by leading the great 
united movement of the entire national forces in the rank of the 
Kampuchean National United Front for National Salvation, and to 
topple it on 7 January 1979m, ushering in a new era of 
independence, freedom, and democracy. 
  In the past 14 years, 1979-93, the CPP has continued to lead 
the movement to defend and build the country bare-handedly. 
While preventing the return of the genocidal regime, our party 
has proceeded with the restoration of the country from the heaps 
of ashes left by the genocidal regime, and thus enabling our 
country to revive gradually. The history of our Cambodian 
nation has recorded the big achievements of our CPP of the past 
over a decade, that is: 
  1. It has rescued our motherland and people from the 
genocidal peril and prevented the return of this wicked regime. 
  2. It has enabled our national society to revive and develop 
in all fields with national independence and sovereignty. 
  3. It has brought back and enhanced the people's democratic 
rights and freedoms and the nation's honor, pride, and prestige 
lost during the Pol Pot regime. 
  4. It is the decisive factor bringing about national 
reunification and peace to the motherland and people. 
  For example, since 1987, while inciting the movement for 
national defense and construction, the CPP has actively 
implemented, through several negotiating forums, its national 
reunification policy with the sincere assistance of the 
international community and the contribution of various 
Cambodian parties, particularly its successive concessions, 
until the Paris Agreements were signed on 23 October 1991. 
  In implementing the Paris accords, our CPP braved many tense 
and complex situations and closely cooperated with the United 
Nations and the various political parties to enable the process 
to succeed. After the elections, the CPP continued to implement 
everything strictly by putting aside some of the problems that 
arose out of the elections. This was in cooperation with the 
political parties which won seats in the National Assembly, 
until a democratic constitution was drafted as the foundation 
for national reunification, democracy, and national development 
in the future. 
  Now, our country has a coalition government formed between 
our CPP and the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an 
Independent, Neutral Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] Party 
and the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party [BLDP]. This is the 
legal and internationally recognized Royal Government that 
responds to the sacred interest of the nation and people. 
  All in all, in its historic mission, the CPP has learned 
from 
its valuable experiences. The CPP has a correct leadership line 
which is neither left or right, but which is mainly in keeping 
with the realities of the country, the people's aspiration, and 
the world trend of each period. 
  The CPP always has close links with the people and shares 
their weal and woe for the supreme interest of the nation and 
people. The CPP forever upholds the front's banner to rally the 
national union and all patriotic forces, regardless of their 
past, to jointly build the country. The CPP firmly adheres to 
the genuine patriotism, maintains close links with the broad 
international solidarity, and wishes to have good ties with all 
countries for the cause of peace, stability, and cooperation on 
the basis of peaceful coexistence. The CPP always remembers and 
inscribes in history the support and assistance given by the 
fraternal parties and peoples and friends near and far to the 
Cambodian people in their just and correct struggle. 
  Beloved samdech, princes, excellencies, ladies, and 
gentlemen, the present mission of the CPP is to join various 
political forces in Cambodia to bring about national 
reconciliation, to consolidate political stability, and build a 
liberal democracy in line with the Constitution of the Kingdom 
of Cambodia [KoC], which will serve as a firm foundation for 
national reconstruction and development. In this connection, 
the CPP continues to maintain and expand its alliance with the 
FUNCINPEC headed by Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, that 
serves as the core of national unity and social stability to 
mobilize the combined forces of the entire nation against all 
complex problems, to move toward successfully implementing the 
Royal Government's political program. 
  But the threat of the genocidal regime's return still 
exists. 
The Khmer Rouge, which has refused to implement the Paris 
Agreement and rejected the present legal Royal Government is 
continuing with its destructive activities against the innocent, 
harming them and their property and wrecking national property. 
  Recently, the Royal Government had displayed its goodwill by 
taking part in the roundtable negotiations with the Khmer Rouge 
held under the king's advice and the lofty chairmanship of His 
Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king of the Kingdom of 
Cambodia, to urgently seek an unconditional and permanent 
cease-fire in the land of the Kingdom of Cambodia. But the two 
roundtable negotiations have failed due to the preconditions set 
by the Khmer Rouge. 
  At the same time, there has been news and the exploitation 
of 
this news by a group of individuals. This has been done with 
the aim of (?misleading) public opinion, upsetting political 
stability, sabotaging the achievements and success made so far 
in seeking a solution to the Cambodian problem, and particularly 
destroying the KoC Constitution, -- the excellent achievement 
made through the efforts of the entire nation and international 
community. 
  All this news might cause some misunderstanding concerning 
the CPP and its leaders. The CPP has emphasized its stand to 
the national and international opinion through its 23 June 1994 
statement. It says the CPP regards the KoC Constitution as the 
excellent achievement of the entire Cambodian nation and the 
international community, which has given immense and sincere 
assistance to our nation. Truly, this excellent achievement 
could be realized because of the excellent leadership of the 
esteemed His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk, under whose 
leadership our nation has already achieved success [words 
indistinct]. This is reflected, for example, by the activities 
of the present three-party Royal Government. The parties are 
cooperating more closely each passing day in managing national 
affairs. For this reason, the CPP pledges to resolutely oppose 
all Khmer Rouge attempts to sabotage the KoC Constitution by 
demanding the dismantling of the National Assembly and the Royal 
Government born of the elections and the formation of a new 
government that includes the Khmer Rouge. 
  If we yield to such a demand by the genocidal elements who 
sabotaged the Paris Agreements, who boycotted and vandalized the 
elections, and who are continuing to destroy the nation, it 
would be tantamount showing serious contempt of the Cambodian 
people nationwide and a heavy blow to the outcome of the UN 
operations in Cambodia. 
  In this connection, the CPP would like to stress that as in 
the past, its present and future stand is to always to respect 
the KoC Constitution, which the Cambodian people of all 
generations to come are duty-bound to strengthen and expand on 
all its achievements in order to lead the country toward 
prosperity. Therefore, the solution to all the present 
problems, including the problems arising from misleading news, 
must be in line with the KoC Constitution. 
  The CPP would like to express its active support for the 
prominent initiative of the U.S. Government and other 
governments and circles across the world in deciding to set up 
an office to study and compile data on the genocidal crimes of 
the Khmer Rouge against the Cambodian people and other 
nationalities in order to bring them to trial. The CPP regards 
this decision as a most valuable search for justice for the 
Cambodian nation and all mankind. 
  Availing myself of this auspicious occasion, I would like 
to express, on behalf of the CPP, My deepest thanks to all 
countries near and far and the international community for 
supporting the Cambodian people's just cause. 
  On the CPP's 43d founding anniversary, from 28 June 1951 to 
28 June 1994, I would like to appeal to all members and 
compatriots to continue striving to successfully fulfill all 
tasks assigned by the people and motherland, in particular, to 
contribute actively to implementing the Royal Government's 
political program; to effectively solve the people's requests 
and grievances; to mobilize forces to firmly defend localities, 
villages, and communes; and vigorously stimulate the 
rainy-season production drive in a timely manner. 
  As for the party members who are officials in all state 
institutions, mass organizations, and non-government 
organizations, you must closely cooperate with the officials of 
the other parties, and surmount inertia by upholding creative 
ingenuity and setting good examples on work and lifestyles for 
the people. 
  Also on this occasion, I would like to appeal to the 
officers 
and men in the ranks of the Khmer Rouge to think of the interest 
of the nation and people because the policy of the Khmer Rouge 
leaders only bring tragedy to the people, religion, and nation. 
Therefore, you should quickly return to the national society 
and to your families. The quicker the better, so as to jointly 
build and make our beloved motherland prosperous as quickly as 
possible. 
  In conclusion, I would like to extend my best wishes to 
samdechs, princes, Supreme Patriarchs, all venerable monks, 
excellencies, ladies, gentlemen, and all international guests. 
May you enjoy the five blessings of Lord Buddha for longevity, 
social prestige, happiness, strength, and enlightenment. Thank 
you. [applause]

  [Text] A bill to outlaw the Party of Democratic Kampuchea 
[PDK] will be presented to the National Assembly for approval in 
early July. National Assembly Chairman Samdech Chea Sim says he 
hopes all members of the National Assembly of the Kingdom of 
Cambodia will support this bill to place the PDK outside of the 
Royal Government's laws. Approval or disapproval of the bill 
requires a two-thirds vote. 
  The Royal Government had considered presenting this bill to 
the National Assembly for a decision (?at its special session) 
but postponed it because His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, 
king of the Kingdom of Cambodia, wanted to pursue the peace 
negotiations.

  [Quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] A government official who requested anonymity told 
REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA on the morning of 27 June that "the royal 
government has already decided that it is time to outlaw the 
Khmer Rouge, despite some differing views within the royal 
government." 
  This official further said: As for the Khmer Rouge, if we do 
not outlaw them, they will not soften their attitude or make 
concessions to the royal government. If the Khmer Rouge are 
left the way they are now, the royal government cannot do 
anything. If they are outlawed and become rebels, they might 
perhaps show some flexibility or even be willing to negotiate 
with the royal government. 
  Concerning the issue of outlawing the Khmer Rouge, it was 
recently rumored that some officials in the royal government do 
not agree with the view of the leaders of the royal government 
and of the National Assembly. 
  The same official affirmed that "what is important and 
constitutes the key for the royal government at present is that 
the royal government wants complete unity within the cabinet ... 
[ellipsis as published] within the royal government in order to 
continue its work to outlaw the Khmer Rouge, because what the 
government is doing now is in accordance with the constitution, 
in response to the aspiration of citizens, and in harmony with 
its mandate. 
  This official further said that, legally, in any government, 
even a coalition government, officials in the cabinet who do not 
follow the policy of the prime minister or the royal government 
can be considered as the government's opponents. Legally, these 
officials should resign, or the prime minister should remove 
them from their posts or dismiss them so that the implementation 
of government policy is not hindered. 
  The same government official further affirmed that "in the 
future the royal government will reshuffle positions in a number 
of ministries; ministers will not be dismissed, but their 
positions will be switched. For example, some officials will be 
removed from the Interior Ministry and transferred to the 
Foreign Affairs Ministry, or removed from the latter to other 
ministries... [ellipsis as published] because for these 
officials the probation period has ended. 
  However, this official did not elaborate on the reshuffle, 
on 
the personalities affected, or when this will be carried out.
