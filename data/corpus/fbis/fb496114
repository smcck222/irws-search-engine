<F P=106> [Speech by Saman Vi-gnaket, chairman of the National </F>
Assembly of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, delivered at a 
Vientiane banquet on 27 June in honor of the visit by 
Philippines House of Representatives delegation, headed by 
Speaker Jose De Venecia, -- recorded] 
  [Text] The friendship visit to our country by Your 
Excellency and your party this time is the first visit by a 
delegation from the House of the Representatives of the Republic 
of Philippines. It marks a new era in the development and 
growth of the relations of friendship and cooperation between 
the Lao and Philippine people, nurtured under the five-point 
priciple of peaceful coexistence, and thus contributing to the 
relations of friendship and cooperation among the nations in 
Southeast Asia and the cause of peace, stability, and progress. 
  Respected excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, we highly 
assess the outcome of our talks held this morning. The 
relations of friendship between Laos and the Philippines have 
been clearly displayed during the talks, where many fine words 
were expressed by His Excellency [H.E.] the Speaker. It has 
served to elevate the Lao-Philippine friendship to a new height. 
I am very proud of the statement of H.E. the Speaker on our 
national development. Your Excellency expressed his impressions 
and hailed our leaders for having guided our economy through the 
mechanisms of the market economy into the international economy. 
He also uttered another impressive statement, saying that 
though Laos is ruled by one party, it has managed to become 
(?fully) democratic. I would like to inform Your Excellency and 
the other Philippine guests here that the Lao Peoples' 
Revolutionary Party has no other aim than to bring wealth and 
well-being to our multiethnic people, to make our country as 
strong, prosperous, and progressive as others, and to (?turn) 
this region into a zone of peace, friendship, stability, and 
cooperation. Your Excellency expressed many other views on our 
country during the talks. He also pledges support for LPDR's 
application for permanent membership to the ASEAN 
Interparliamentary Organization, to enable the Lao People's 
Democratic Republic to be admitted as a permanent member of 
ASEAN. Your Excellency expressed his desire to set up the 
Lao-Philippine and Philippine-Lao parliamentary friendship 
associations. Your Excellency also proposed to further 
strengthen our cooperation by setting up our respective 
embassies in Vientiane and Manila. He pledged to render 
cooperation in economy, public health, medicine, language study, 
and other areas to Laos. 
  All this clearly shows Your Excellency's goods intentions as 
well as those of the Philippine people toward Laos, hoping that 
our country can be developed to become as progressive and 
prosperous as others in this region. 
  On this auspicious occasion, I would like to express my deep 
thanks to Your Excellency, Mr. Speaker, and to your wife and all 
the Philippine people. To honor Your Excellency, your wife and 
your party, I invite all distinguished guests to raise your 
glasses and toast to the health and happiness of H.E. Fidel

  [Excerpts] Jakarta, Jun 28 (OANA-ANTARA) -- President 
Suharto and visiting Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating 
agreed here Tuesday to work together to reduce Indonesia's trade 
deficit with Australia. 
  Both leaders shared the view that bilateral trade ties 
between the two countries need to be intensified to cut the 
deficit, Minister/State Secretary Murdiono said when announcing 
the results of a two-hour talk between President Suharto and 
Prime Minister Paul Keating. 
  Two-way trade between Australia and Indonesia is worth US 
$2.15 billion a year. 
  In the meeting, which lasted 30 minutes longer than 
scheduled, the two heads of state also discussed the upcoming 
informal summit of APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) to 
be held in Bogor, about 50 km south of Jakarta, on 15 November 
this year. 
  The second APEC meeting will be attended by representatives 
from 18 countries, namely the ASEAN member states (Indonesia, 
Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and 
Thailand), the United States, New Zealand, Mexico, Papua New 
Guinea, Chile, Australia, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Canada, 
Taiwan and Japan. Prime Minister Keating expressed his readiness 
to help Indonesia make the APEC meeting a success, Minister 
Murdiono said. [passage omitted -- covered in referent item] 
  Minister Murdiono also confirmed that President Suharto 
explained about the recent revocation of the licences of TEMPO 
weekly magazine, EDITOR magazine and DETIK tabloid to his guest. 
  Keating arrived here on Monday for a three-day visit to hold 
talks with President Suharto and other Indonesian officials. He 
is also scheduled to open a major Australian trade exhibition on 
Wednesday. 
  The trade exhibition is a part of "Australia Today Indonesia 
'94", the largest trade and cultural promotion program Australia 
has ever undertaken in the region. It is scheduled to last 
until 3 July 1994. This is the third visit Keating has made to 
Indonesia since he became prime minister.

  [Text] Jakarta, June 28 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Visiting 
Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating said that he welcomes the 
recent issuance of economic deregulation package to encourage 
greater foreign investments flow to Indonesia. 
  "We are happy about the decision taken by Indonesia to adopt 
a policy of greater investment opportunities and also about 
today's news reports on more deregulation packages," Keating 
told a press conference here Tuesday. 
  Jakarta on Monday announced a deregulation package for the 
industrial sector that reduces import duties on 739 tariff codes 
covering manufacturing, agricultural, and health products. 
  The government earlier this month also announced a new 
investment policy which allows foreign investors to have 95 
percent shares in a join venture company. 
  Trade value between Indonesia and Australia was recorded at 
U.S. $3 billion in 1993. 
  Keating also said that issues on Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum, bilateral ties, and economic 
cooperation dominated his two-hour talk with President Suharto 
earlier Tuesday. 
  He said that during the meeting President Suharto briefed 
him 
on the importance of maintaining national stability and national 
unity at a time of great economic growth and transformation. 
  Underlining that relationship between Indonesia and 
Australia 
have improved dramatically in the last few years, he said that 
the president also touched on other issues on the World Trade 
Organization. [sentence as received] 
  When asked about the roles of Indonesia and ASEAN in general 
within the structure of APEC, Keating said that ASEAN obviously 
has a great role in the APEC forum. 
  "Indonesia now chairs the APEC," he said adding that such a 
position is making Indonesia and other ASEAN countries important. 
  He further said that he had also expressed his regret to 
President Suharto over the recent banning of three Indonesian 
weeklies. 
  However, he also quoted the Indonesian head of state as 
saying that "journalists had put some of these things... 
national unity and stability at risk." 
  The banned press publications are TEMPO, EDITOR, and DETIK 
which are all based in Jakarta. 
  Keating arrived in Jakarta on Monday evening for a two day 
unofficial visit during which he will open an 
Australia-Indonesia business seminar and attend the Australia 
Today Indonesia 1994 held here from June 29 to July 3.

  [Excerpt] Surabaya, Friday -- The Indonesian Navy will soon 
procure at least six to nine CN-235 maritime patrol aircraft 
after its acquisition of 39 former East German warships. 
  The aircraft will replace several aging Australian-made N-22 
Nomad maritime patrol aircraft, which are currently being used 
in maritime patrols along Indonesia's 6,000km coastline. 
  Speaking after taking a ceremonial salute from a 
guard-of-honor mounted by the members of the Eastern Regional 
Air Maritime Fleet unit at Ujung wharf in Surabaya on 17 June, 
Tanto Kuswanto, chief of staff of the Indonesian Navy said: "We 
hope to get the approval to procure the new aircraft." 
  He said the CN-235 aircraft has similar capabilities to the 
N-22 Nomad and can fly at low altitudes and at a lower speed. 
Besides being appropriate for maritime patrol purposes, the 
aircraft can also perform extra functions as desired by the 
navy's air maritime patrol unit, such as conducting 
antisubmarine operations, tactical surveillance, the 
transportation of task forces and the provision of swift 
logistics support. 
  He confirmed that the Eastern Regional Air Maritime Fleet 
unit, which is a long arm of the navy's Joint Weapons System 
(SSAT), has yet to be fully operational, particularly in 
detection operations.[passage omitted]

  [Text] The parliamentary Functional Group has asked all 
sides, particularly security forces and demonstrrators, to 
exercise self-restraint. Several members of the group made the 
appeal during a news conference in Jakarta today. On the 
occasion, Abdullah Alatas Fahmi, chairman of the Department of 
Information, Publication, and Mass Media of the Functional Group 
Central Executive Council, asked the security forces to handle 
demonstrations proportionally and not execessively. On the 
other hand, the demonstrators were asked to exercise 
self-restraint in order not to complicate the situation. 
  Meanwhile, Abu Hassan Sazili, vice chairman of the 
parliamentary Functional Group, stressed the need for all sides 
to coolly respond to the situation in the wake of the license 
revocation of several publications. 
  Sugeng Wijaya, member of parliamentary Commission I [Roman 
numeral one, in charge of foreign affairs, defense, security, 
and information] reminded the press circles not to be afraid of 
carrying out their duties and roles if they are carried out in 
accordance with the journalistic ethics.

  [Text] Jakarta, June 28 (AFP) -- Up to 21 people arrested 
Monday during demonstrations protesting a government ban on 
three weekly publications were to appear in Central Jakarta 
district court Tuesday. 
  There will be three separate hearings for the demonstrators, 
who include prominent poet Rendra, said court official Amir 
Samsudin. 
  He said 29 demonstrators had been arrested but seven were 
released immediately. One man, identified only as Viktor, was 
detained for allegedly instigating the demonstration, and will 
face trial later. 
  One of Rendra's relatives said the demonstrators had been 
questioned without lawyers being present. 
  Rita Kalibonso, a lawyer with the country's leading human 
rights group Legal Aid Foundation, said the 21 demonstrators 
were considered to have committed minor offences under the law 
and could be dealt with summarily. 
  They were likely to face charges either of refusing to 
disperse despite repeated warnings by security officials, or 
holding a mass gathering of more than five people without a 
police permit. The offences carry maximum sentences of 18 weeks 
and two-week jail terms respectively. 
  The government's decision last week to revoke the licences 
of 
three popular weekly publications TEMPO, EDITOR and DETIK which 
had criticised a minister close to President Suharto has 
triggered protests from several human rights groups, students, 
journalists and artists. 
  On Monday hundreds of anti-riot police and military in 
combat-fatigues and wearing black T-shirts with "Operation 
Cleansing 1994" written on them, broke up the demonstrations.

  [Text] Jakarta, June 28 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- The Central 
Executive Board of the Indonesian Journalists Association (PWI) 
told its members here Tuesday to maintain self-restraint so they 
would not be carried away by activities outside the PWI 
regulations. 
  In a statement signed by Chairman Tribuana Said and 
Secretary 
General Parni Hadi, PWI expressed its worries that 
demonstrations as a follow up of the recent closure of three 
Jakarta weeklies might only ruin efforts still being worked out 
by the association to solve the banning problem. 
  PWI noted that demonstrations have been used as a means of 
expression of various aspirations which might further complicate 
things. 
  Therefore, the association called on all of its members to 
always uphold previous statements which among others expressed 
concerns over the banning. 
  However, at the same time, the statements expressed 
understanding as well over the government's reasons behind such 
a decision. 
  PWI, the Tuesday's statement said, had encouraged the 
government to issue a new press publication permit so that all 
PWI members previously affiliated to the three banned weeklies 
would not be left without employment for too long. 
  It further said that as long as legal and professional 
mechanism are upheld by all the concerned parties, revocation of 
press publication permit would not take place again in the 
future.

aimed at boosting investment, efficiency and productivity, but 
also at raising business and employment opportunities and 
expediting development. 
  "The objectives are to increase the economic and national 
strength and endurance," the minister said, adding that the 
deregulation includes import duties, tariff surcharges and check 
prices. 
  President Suharto on Monday received nine senior ministers 
in 
connection with the newly announced deregulatory package. 
  Under the new deregulation, import duties on textile 
machinery and components as well as textile dyes are reduced 
from 10 to 25 percent, while duties on agricultural machinery 
has been reduced by five to 20 percent. 
  Import duties on tools and machinery for small scale 
industries such as sewing machines, lathes, drills, carpentry 
tools, dressing machines and other tools have been reduced to 
five percent or totally eliminated. 
  He said that the import duty on the completely built-up 
(CBU) 
passenger car and station wagon has been reduced by 25 percent, 
while for spare parts for the semi-trailer, it has been reduced 
to 10 percent and duties on spare parts for the work-truck have 
been eliminated. 
  "Import duties on components and sub-components for the 
assembling of heavy duty equipment are completely lifted 
beginning on January 1 next year," he added. 
  In the agricultural sector, the minister said that import 
duties on some products such as wheat and rice flour, yellow 
soybeans and cane sugar, that have so far been imported by the 
National Logistic Board (Bulog), have been eliminated. 
  Import duties on corn, soybean meal, potatoes, coffee, tea, 
sunflower seeds, margarine, fish meal, shrimp meal, processed 
fish, processed food and livestock, barley, peanut meal and 
sorghum have been reduced by five percent. 
  "The import duty on coconut and palm oil have been reduced 
to 
zero percent," he added. 
  He said that any price distortion caused by "dumping" 
activities will be prevented by "anti-dumping policies". 
  The government also decided to increase the import duty on 
38 
tariff codes for products containing a certain alcohol content. 
  Of the 38 tariff codes, import duties on 33 tariff codes 
have 
increased by 170 percent, four tariff codes by 80 percent and 
one by 70 percent. 
  Trade Minister S.B. Judono said that the aim of increasing 
the import duty on goods with alcoholic content was to minimise 
the domestic consumption of alcohol which has had a negative 
impact on society. 
  On the occasion, the finance minister also announced some 
regulation changes giving small scale entrepreneurs and 
cooperative agencies easier access to funds provided by 
state-run companies (BUMN). 
  The stipulation on what funds raised from BUMN can be used 
for has been expanded, the maximum limit on the share of BUMN 
surplus allocated to small scale businesses (which currently 
stands at 500 rupiah million per BUMN) has been eliminated, and 
efforts are being made to ensure that one percent of the BUMN's 
surplus is allocated to the scheme.

  [Excerpt] Jakarta, KOMPAS -- At least 17 nongas export 
commodities slotted for export to six out of 20 countries 
recorded a decline. This has prevented any acceleration in the 
export of nongas commodities. In this regard, the government and 
the private sector should embark on anticipatory measures to 
curb Indonesia's current decline in nongas exports. 
  This was stated by Rudy Lengkong, the head of the National 
Export Development Board, BPEN, during a hearing of the 
Parliamentary Commission VII [Roman seven] headed by Lukman R. 
Boer on 22 June. 
  Agricultural products and manufactured goods are among the 
17 
export items in decline. 
  According to Rudy Lengkong, an impromptu analysis conducted 
by the Department of Industry indicated that the decline in the 
nongas export commodities was due to weaker demand for such 
commodities. 
  In general, Indonesia was not the only country suffering 
such 
a decline. For example, the Netherlands also noted an 18.44 
percent decline in its exports. Italy's export volume also 
dropped 24.15 percent in global markets, while France's exports 
noted a 15.43 percent downswing. These countries are in fact 
Indonesia's major export venues in West Europe. 
  Apart from this, the emergence of new competitors for 
Indonesia in international markets has also contributed to the 
country's decline in its exports. China and Vietnam are 
currently making efforts to find markets for their products, 
particularly manufactured goods which are relatively similar to 
those offered by Indonesia. Meanwhile, Indonesia's traditional 
competitors -- Thailand, Malaysia and some others -- are also 
strong contenders. 
  The decline in prices was also one of the factors for the 
drop in Indonesia's nongas exports. Rudy Lengkong said: "The 
weaker demand in several markets due to recession, which was 
followed by a deluge of export commodities, caused the decline 
in prices for several nongas commodities -- including textiles, 
textiles products, and rubber." 
  Another factor which has also contributed to the continuing 
decline of Indonesia's exports of nongas commodities is the 
Indonesian entrepreneurs' inability in setting up foreign trade 
networks in regions with market potential, which could guarantee 
a continuous and secure market access. Strangely, China and 
India are the only countries which have foreign trade networks 
at an international level. [Passage omitted]

  [Text] Jakarta, June 28 (OANA-ANTARA) -- The government has 
set up an inter-ministerial commission to deal with Acquired 
Immunity Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), the deadly disease which is 
also on the rise in Indonesia, it was announced here Tuesday. 
  Secretary of the Office of the Coordinating Minister of 
People's Welfare Suyono Yahya said the commission -- created by 
a presidential decree, bore the task of fighting the spread and 
"not the victims" of the incurable disease. 
  The commission would launch programmes to fight AIDS not 
only 
at national and provincial levels but at district level as well, 
Yahya said. 
  He said the commission's programmes would emphasize efforts 
at preventing people from contracting HIV, the virus that leads 
to AIDS. 
  The commission would also disseminate information on AIDS 
designed to let the public have the right knowledge and 
understanding of the disease. This was necessary to prevent the 
public from unduly becoming restive when encountering or having 
to live with actual AIDS cases. 
  Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare Azwar Anas is 
chairman of the commission while four other cabinet ministers, 
namely Health Minister Suyudi, Religious Affairs Minister 
Tarmizi Taher, Social Affairs Minister Inten Suweno and State 
Minister for Population Affairs Haryono Suyono will be members. 
  The following cabinet ministers are also involved in the 
commission: Information Minister Harmoko, Tourism, Post and 
Telecommunications Minister Joop Ave, Home Affairs Minister Yogi 
S. Memed and Youth and Sports Minister Hayono Isman.

  [Text] The Philippines and Indonesia have agreed to three 
principles to govern its special meeting in the drawing up of 
maritime boundary. This was announced by Philippine Foreign 
Affairs Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino. The principles include 
the applicability of international laws and the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea, which goes into effect this 
year, to establish the extent of national maritime jurisdiction. 
  Another is the adoption of the medium-line principle, 
whenever applicable, which set boundaries between two designated 
points. And the third is the adoption of (?uncertified) 
creative option. 
  Undersecretary Severino said the principles were agreed upon 
in the two-day talks in Manado last week and further talks would 
cover the area including the Celebes Sea and Cape San Agustin in 
the southern Philippines. Severino said designating borders 
could help prevent the occurrence in which Filipinos are 
arrested for fishing in Indonesian borders without a permit.

<F P=106> [By Edu Lopez and F.V. Maragay] </F>
  [Text] President Ramos yesterday issued Executive Order 
[EO] No. 182 allowing foreigners to invest in more areas of the 
local economy. 
  EO 182 dovetailed with the announcement of the National 
Economic Development Authority [NEDA] yesterday that "List C" of 
the First Regular Investment Negative List (RFINL) [as 
published] would be "empty" or a total blank because no petition 
from local industries was filed as of the deadline on 31 August 
1993. 
  "This is a development welcomed by the investing community 
because there are no further restrictions being made by the 
government on the investment environment," NEDA said in a 
statement. 
  List C, which was approved by NEDA last 21 June, was 
intended 
to be a list of investment areas that existing local industries 
have adequately filled and are therefore off-limits to foreign 
investors. Since list C is a total blank, only negative lists A 
and B remain. 
  List A includes areas in which foreign ownership is limited 
by mandate of the Constitution and specific nationalization 
laws. List B contains investment areas where foreign ownership 
Is limited for purposes of public health and safety and to 
protect small and medium-sized domestic market enterprises. 
  Among the restricted areas in List A are mass media, 
licensed 
professions, cooperatives, utilization of natural resources and 
public utilities. List B includes manufacturers of weapons and 
explosives, dangerous drugs, small and medium scale domestic 
market enterprises and export enterprises which utilize raw 
materials from depleting natural resources. 
  Pursuant to RA [Republic Act] 7042, no foreign equity is 
allowed in mass media, retail trade, cooperatives, private 
security agencies, small-scale mining, utilization of marine 
resources and rice and corn industry. 
  Industries where 40 percent foreign equity may be allowed 
include exploration, development and utilization of natural 
resources; ownership of private lands, operation and management 
of public utilities; ownership and establishment of educational 
institutions, and financing companies regulated by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  Manufacture, repair, storage and distribution of products 
and 
ingredients used for manufacturing firearms, gunpowder, dynamite 
and blasting supples. [sentence as published] 
  Manufacture and distribution of dangerous drugs; sauna and 
steam bath houses, massage clinics; certain forms of gambling 
like race track operations and racehorse ownership and 
importation domestic market enterprises with paid-in equity 
capital of less than the equivalent of $500,000 unless they 
involve advanced technology; and export enterprises which 
utilize raw materials from depleting natural resources and with 
paid-in equity capital on less than $500,000. 
  EO 182 means that foreign investors would then be allowed to 
invest in such formerly restricted businesses as travel 
agencies, tourist lodging services (pension houses and tourist 
inns), convention and conference organizing, life and non-life 
insurance business including professional insurance services and 
reinsurance brokerage. 
  The Federation of Philippine Industries (FPI) headed by 
businessman Raul T. Concepcion had protested NEDA's decision to 
close the "List C" of the RFINL on the ground that local 
businessmen were not adequately informed that they had to submit 
petitions for entries in the list. 
  The Cabinet cluster-B, however, turned down FPI's petition 
for an extension of the period for filing of petitions for 
inclusion in "List C," citing that ample announcements had been 
made and sufficient time was given for the filing of petitions. 
  NEDA argued that adequate exploitation by Philippine 
nationals as a criterion for determining foreign equity 
participation should not be at the expense of the majority of 
Filipino consumers whose interests should also be of primary 
concern. 
  "Adequate capacity" is not a sound basis for excluding 
foreign investments in a particular sector, NEDA said. 
Restricting entry in an industry on the basis of "adequate 
capacity" encourages existing firms with high-cost production 
techniques to continue operating at the expense of consumers, it 
said. 
  A foreign company would enter if it has something better to 
offer and can compete with the existing firms by offering 
quality products at lower prices that would benefit consumers 
and domestic producers, NEDA added. 
  The Board of Investments (BOI) had stopped using "adequate 
capacity" as a criterion because it would only enable existing 
enterprises to exercise monopoly powers.

  [Text] The Marines today captured the center of Abu 
Sayyaf's camp in Sampinid, Basilan. The Abu Sayyaf group was 
forced to flee Hill 734, their biggest camp in Sampinid, after 
an intensive military operation. Here is Arnold Clavio's report 
from Basilan: 
  [Begin Clavio recording] Government troops have overrun at 3 
AM today Hill 734 in Sampinid complex, the center of the Abu 
Sayyaf camp. The military had been in an offensive position 
since last night, prepared to finally capture the reputed 
kingdom of Barhama Sali. 
  When the camp was captured, the military immediately named 
it 
Camp (Gadjuli), in recognition of the heroism of Lieutenant 
Colonel (Johnson Gadjuli), who had earlier planned the capture 
of the Sampinid complex, but was unfortunately shot in the head 
by an Abu Sayyaf sniper. 
  At present, the military is continuing its mop up operation 
and its pursuit of Sali's group in Sampinid. Colonel Edgardo 
Espinosa, commander of the 3d Marine Brigade, said they are 
carefully scouring the complex for possible land mines buried by 
fleeing bandits. Espinosa added that they are scheduled to 
exhume the bodies of Abu Sayyaf members killed, and excavate the 
group's arms cache. 
  According to Espinosa, once they have totally cleared the 
perimeters of Sampinid complex, they will immediately establish 
a permanent battalion of Marines in the area. The 445th 
Engineering Battalion will also join and undertake 
reconstruction of houses. 
  Meanwhile, the bodies of three Marines who were earlier 
reported missing were found today. The bodies of Sergeant Edgar 
Escobidal, Sgt. Vicente Kaplanan, and Private First Class 
Romarico Espijo were flown to Zamboanga City. The number of 
casualties on the military side has reached nine, while 41 Abu 
Sayyaf members have been killed. [end recording]

  [Text] President Ramos yesterday ordered the release of 
some P [pesos] 52 million for various development projects in 
the provinces of Albay and Sorsogon. 
  Mr. Ramos made the fund releases during his trip to the two 
Bicol provinces. 
  He assured the people of Bicol that his government will 
continue to support the region's development through the speedy 
release of much-needed funds to finance needed infrastructure 
projects and improve delivery of basic services. 
  The president released some P5 million for the improvement 
of 
the Gabao-Bacon Airport and the P10 million for the improvement 
and extension of some major roads in Sorsogon. 
  "My commitment to you is to make you more accessible to the 
rest of the country," Mr. Ramos said. 
  He disclosed that a study is being done for the development 
of the Sorsogon town port. The port cannot be used because of 
its siltation problem. 
  The president also released P6 million for the construction 
of the Ligao-Pio Duran Road and another P6 million for the 
construction of various schoolbuildings in the region. 
  Manilao and Tabaco municipalities also got calamity funds 
amounting to P1.5 million and P3 million each. 
  In his meeting with public officials, the president again 
called for national unity in trying to achieve economic 
development for the entire country. 
  He said his government aims to make the Philippines an 
aggressive participant in global trade. 
  "To attain Philippines 2000, we must work together because 
the name of the game out there in the international arena is 
competitiveness," the president said. 
  "We must show that as a national team, we are as good, if 
not 
better, than they are," the president added. 
  During the civic assembly in Sorsogon, the president also 
handed out P1.54 [amount as published] check each to the 
principals of the Sorsogon National High School and the 
Callanosa National High School for the construction of their 
science and laboratory buildings.

  [Text] Top officials of the Philippine Army have ordered 
the deactivation of two infantry battalions in Bicol and Davao 
del Sur to streamline the military organization. 
  This is aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness 
of Army troopers both in combat and non-combat missions, Lt. 
Gen. Romulo F. Yap, Army chief, said. 
  He ordered the disbandment of the 49th Infantry Battalion 
based in Barangay [Village] Bacolod, Una, Sorsogon, and the 37th 
Infantry Battalion in Sitio [Village District] Cogon, Barangay 
Tuban, Sta. [Santa] Cruz, Davao del Sur. 
  Yap said the deactivation of the two battalions, each with 
about 300 troopers takes effect on 1 July. 
  With the deactivation of the two battalions, only 76 remain 
engaged in counterinsurgency, ecological preservation, and 
support operations to police forces in neutralizing organized 
criminal organizations. 
  The Army chief said 20 percent of the battalion's personnel 
who were undertaking administrative jobs in their headquarters 
unit can be reassigned to other battalions as part of the 
regular forces. 
  "While we lessen the manpower involved in administrative 
jobs 
in every headquarters, unit we increase the regular troopers 
engaged in combat missions," Yap said. 
  When Yap assumed command of the Philippine Army last April, 
he urged the implementation of the total quality management 
(TQM) approach aimed at maximizing the efficiency of every unit 
despite the constraints in material resources to achieve the 
command's objectives. 
  Army authorities, who refused to be identified, said more 
battalions will be deactivated, as part of the military's 
streamlining efforts.

  [Text] The Philippine National Police [PNP] has created a 
special unit which assist the Department of Environment and 
Natural Resources (DENR) in implementing environment protection 
laws. 
  Outgoing Philippine National Police chief, Director General 
Umberto Rodriguez, said the new police unit called by PNP 
Environment and Natural Resources Protection Force (ENRPF), to 
be known as the PNP Green Army, shall be composed of selected 
men from the PNP Regional Mobile Force and will be backed by 
local units from PNP Traffic Management Command, the PNP 
Maritime Command, the Police Aviation Security Command, 
Philippine Coast Guard and the local police units. 
  The PNP chief issued last 25 May Letter of Instruction 17/94 
dubbed as "Oplan Kalikasan [Nature Operation Plan]" aimed at 
assisting the DENR in implementing ecology protection laws. 
  ENRPF teams were specifically tasked to conduct crackdown on 
illegal logging, illegal fishing and coral collection, poaching 
by foreign fishermen, the campaign against smoke-belching 
vehicles in urban centers. 
  The ENRPF will closely coordinate with the intelligence 
units 
of the Department of Agriculture, DENR and Coast Guard and 
concerned non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to apprehend 
violators. 
  Regional directors who were given authority to decide how 
many members the local ENRPF, will also have direct command and 
supervision of the local ENRPF units. [sentence as published] 
  All items seized from arrested suspects will be turned over 
to concerned government agencies that will also handle the 
investigation and filing of appropriate charges. 
  Early this year, the PNP, on orders of the president, 
deployed a company of SAF [expansion unknown] troops in Lanao 
del Sur to guard against illegal logging operations in the Lake 
Lanao watershed area.

  [Text] Another power project will be constructed in the 
Philippines. President Ramos, on Monday, led the groundbreaking 
rites for the Masinloc coal-fired thermal power plant in 
Zambales in northern Luzon. The $525.6 million project will add 
600 megawatts of electricity to the Luzon grid by 1998. 
  In his speech, the president told the residents of Masinloc 
to discard their fears of environmental pollution and hazards 
that the project may bring. The president assured them that 
this will not happen due to the rigid standards adopted by those 
involved in the planning and construction of the new power plant.

  [Text] The Thai Red Cross Society's AID Programme Director 
denied yesterday he had violated the National HIV/AID, Vaccine 
Development Plan and planned to continue with vaccine trials on 
Thai volunteers. 
  Dr Praphan Phanuphak said he would give the volunteers a 
second dose of the vaccine on July 7. 
  The first dose was administered to 3 volunteers in the 
country's first ever vaccine trial on June 6. 
  Dr Praphan said the blood from a third of the volunteers was 
sent to Chulalongkon University's Medical Department for 
testing, a third to United Biomedical Incorporation of the 
United States -- the vaccine producer -- for testing, and a 
third was being stored at an independent laboratory ready for 
dispatch to research places which request it. 
  "I was one of the members who drafted the National HIV/AIDS 
Vaccine Development Plan. Why should I violate the plan?" he 
asked. 
  There were reports last week Dr Praphan had violated the 
plan 
by not setting up a laboratory as part of the programme to test 
the volunteers. 
  The doctor said reports of HIV infection among seven 
volunteers undergoing a similar programme in the United States 
should serve as a warning to Thai volunteers that no vaccine has 
yet been able to prevent the infection of the disease. 
  Of the 30 volunteers here, 24 have been given the actual 
vaccine while the other six have received a placebo in the form 
of glucose and water. 
  Dr Praphan said he had explained the vaccine to the 
volunteers and had warned them to be careful. 
  The World Health Organization's Global Programme on AIDS 
Research and Intervention Development director Peter Piot, said 
WHO was very disappointed with the decision by the United States 
not to assess whether vaccines tested at the first and second 
phase were effective or not. 
  "There is an urgent need in the world to have a vaccine and 
we will continue the trial programmes throughout the world, 
including those being conducted in Thailand, Brazil and Uganda." 
  Dr Praphan said the decision by the US to postpone the third 
phase of the vaccine trials would not affect his own tests. 
  He said the programme required about $20 million in 
financial 
support from the Government so the US had decided to observe the 
results of vaccine trials in other countries before going ahead 
with its third phase.

  [Text] Speaking to reporters prior to his departure for 
Vietnam today, Admiral Prachet Siridet said during his official 
visit he would call on commanders of the Vietnamese armed forces 
and the defense minister and hold consultations on several 
issues. In particular, he said, the fishing problem will be 
raised. He noted that it is the duty of the navy to ensure the 
safety and proper treatment of Thai fishing trawlers in the 
international waters off Indonesia and in the South Pacific when 
they sail home through the specific economic zones of 
neighboring countries. They should not be left to face any act 
of bullying or harassment on their way home. 
  Asked about the Cambodian Government's attempt to outlaw the 
Khmer Rouge, the navy commander said this is a rather tough 
issue but Thailand does not interfere in internal affairs of 
Cambodia. However, it will affect Thailand because the Khmer 
Rouge is one of the factions that will always engage in 
fighting. If the fighting takes place near the border, 
Cambodian people will again flee to Thailand and this will cause 
problems to the Thai people. The world wants to see national 
reconciliation in Cambodia. In practice, it is not that easy. 
Meanwhile, Thailand will try to persuade the Cambodian factions 
to compromise.

  [Text] Thailand is considering arranging the "orderly 
return" of Laotians who do not volunteer to return home. 
  "Laotians should go home on a voluntary basis," said 
National 
Security Council deputy secretary-general Khachatphai Burutphat, 
"but some may not volunteer to go home and we may have to send 
them back in an orderly return program as Hong Kong has done 
with Vietnamese boat people." 
  Mr. Khachatphai's remarks, made at the end of a two-day 
meeting which sought to speed up the repatriation of Laotians 
still encamped in Thailand, referred to the bilateral agreement 
between Hong Kong and Vietnam for the "orderly return" of boat 
people with no prospects of resettlement in the West. 
  The meeting also drew senior officials from Laos and the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 
  The UNHCR's Thailand representative, Ruprecht von Arnim, 
said 
both Thailand and Laos agreed the repatriation process could 
continue for another year. 
  The agreement conforms with the Comprehensive Plan of Action 
(CPA) which calls for solutions by the end of 1995 to the 
problem of Vietnamese and Laotians still encamped in this region. 
  But Thailand still insists on closing its last camp for 
Laotians at Ban Na Pa in Nakhon Phanom by the end of this year. 
  "We must emphasise the closure of the camp rather than the 
extension of the repatriation period," said Mr. Khachatphai. 
  "There are many ways to persuade the remaining refugees to 
return on a voluntary basis." 
  Thailand reportedly put the accent on the provision of 
training as part of its proposal to accelerate the repatriation 
process. The Thai proposal calls for returnees be put in a kind 
of half-way house in Laos pending full reintegration into the 
country. 
  The Laotian side led by Don Somvolachit of the Foreign 
Ministry's Department of Europe and America Affairs, proposed 
two new settlement sites for the returnees in the central 
provinces of Khammouane and Bolikhamsai. 
  The UNHCR will inspect the sites and draw up a financial 
plan 
for the projects, said Mr. von Arnim. 
  As part of the effort to speed up repatriation, he said the 
meeting discussed deterrents and incentives. 
  The UNHCR raised the possibility of halving the allowances 
granted to returnees -- now set at 2,000 baht per person -- if 
they return after 30 September. Laos said it would give those 
arriving before that date carpentry tools and housing items.

  [Excerpt] Mr. Khanchit Kantangkun, the assistant managing 
director of the Krung Thai Bank, talked about the plan by 
officials to promulgate a money-laundering law in an effort to 
stop the laundering of "dirty" money. He said that if this law 
actually is promulgated, it will have a great effect on 
financial institutions, particularly commercial bank customers. 
Thus, officials should clearly stipulate the limitations of this 
law so that this does not affect depositors. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Prasit Damrongchai] </F>
  [Excerpts] At the end of 1992 and beginning of 1993, as a 
member of the Political Science and Public Administration Branch 
of the National Research Council, I was asked to conduct a study 
on "The Suppression of Unusual Wealth in Thai Government 
Circles." It was hoped that the results of this study would 
benefit the country and society in general. 
  One of the important questions of this study was the 
question 
of how to seize the assets of wealthy state officials who have 
gained their wealth by defrauding the public. The money they 
earn from engaging in corrupt activities is considered to be 
dirty money that must be seized and returned to the country. 
  The main problem is not authority to seize assets, because 
OCCC [Office of the Commission to Counter Corruption] laws have 
been promulgated. The problem is to find the location of the 
huge sums of money earned from engaging in corrupt activities. 
  I think that in carrying on narcotics suppression 
activities, 
the ONCB [Office of the Narcotics Control Board] probably faces 
the same problem. That is, it has the authority to seize assets 
based on ONCB laws, but it is difficult to find out where the 
narcotics traffickers keep their money and how they transfer it. 
  Those who are best informed about the movement of this cash 
are the banks and other financial institutions. Thus, to locate 
the cash earned from engaging in corruption and trafficking in 
narcotics, we must rely mainly on information provided by the 
banks and financial institutions. To achieve real results, a 
special law must be promulgated that will make it possible to 
locate this dirty money and prevent it from being transferred 
and laundered. To put it simply, we must prevent this money from 
being laundered, because it is then very difficult to prove 
whether the money is "clean" or "dirty" money. [passage omitted] 
  Even though this law will be very beneficial, many people 
don't think that it will be possible to promulgate such a law. 
The powerholders in Thai society will probably oppose this and 
take steps to prevent this bill from being passed by the 
legislative council. The commercial banks, which would be 
required to regularly file reports, are afraid that this will 
increase the burden on them. Besides this, the money that once 
flowed into the system will flow out of the system. The foreign 
currency that flowed into the country will go to other countries 
that do not have such a law. This will put our domestic economy 
at a disadvantage as compared with that of neighboring countries. 
  Some groups hold differing views. Some think that this will 
infringe on people's personal rights. Others think that it won't 
be worth the price if we allow money to flow out of the country. 
Others think that our monetary and banking systems are fine as 
they are and that it isn't necessary to promulgate a special law. 
  While I was writing the report on the results of the study, 
I 
began to feel that getting this law passed by parliament would 
probably be as difficult as pushing a mortar up a hill. This is 
because there are very few people who support this. Many people 
will be adversely affected, and most of these are highly 
influential people who will oppose this, which is exactly what 
has happened in many other countries. 
  But today, many people are interested in this and so there 
is 
hope that something can be done: 
  1. A way must be found to have countries throughout the 
world 
cooperate in promulgating such a law. Because the present 
economic situation is now an international matter, it should be 
easier to obtain such cooperation. 
  2. Fears concerning individual rights should carry little 
weight. Even in the United States, Professor Peter Baldwin Jr., 
a professor at the University of Florida and an expert on 
money-laundering laws, whom the OCCC invited to come give a 
lecture on 3 December 1993, has said that those who violate the 
law, particularly those who engage in corruption, have forfeited 
the personal rights guaranteed by the constitution. If dirty 
money is kept somewhere, that place must be considered dirty, 
too. For example, if a house is used to conceal dirty money, the 
state can seize that house. 
  3. We are in the information age. It is easy to transmit 
information to people everywhere. The mass media can help inform 
the people about the advantages and disadvantages. 
  4. Most members of the legislative council are concerned 
about the common good rather than person interests. 
  Because money laundering is a very complex issue and affects 
people in many countries, unless this problem is discussed in a 
reasonable manner, conflicts and problems will arise. Thus, to 
promulgate this law, things must be done very carefully. The 
objectives must be very clear, and everyone must be made to 
understand the reasons for this. If this law is really good, it 
will be difficult for people to oppose it. This is a good 
opportunity for those who support the principles of this law to 
prove their case.

  [Text] Mr. Wichit Suphinit, the governor of the Bank of 
Thailand (BoT), discussed the efforts being made to promulgate a 
money-laundering law. He said that the BoT agrees in principle 
with the need to promulgate such a law. The BoT has discussed 
the principles and framework of this law with Mr. Tharin 
Nimmanmoen, the minister of finance. It is felt that such a law 
will eventually be promulgated. 
  As for reports that the BoT has not taken a clear position 
in 
supporting the promulgation of this law because of the fear that 
this will affect foreign investment in accord with the policy of 
providing financial freedom, Mr. Wichit said that if this law is 
implemented, it definitely won't affect foreign investment. 
  Mr. Wichit said that the BoT is now studying this in detail, 
including the limitations, responsibilities, means of 
implementation, and effects of this law. It has compiled data 
and participated in seminars with other countries that are in 
the process of implementing such laws. The results achieved by 
countries, such as Singapore, that have already implemented such 
a law are being considered, too.

  [Text] Mr. Wichit Suphinit, the governor of the Bank of 
Thailand, issued a statement following Mr. Giff, the head of the 
G-7 (seven industrialized countries) work team. He said that he 
had come to explain the details of the money-laundering law as a 
course of action for Thailand. In principle, the central bank 
feels that the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages. 
  Three points where submitted for consideration: 1. 
Disclosing 
the account figures of customers. Consideration must be given to 
promulgating a law to protect those who make disclosures, 
because this could pose a danger to financial institutions that 
enjoy the trust of depositors. 2. Using special or fictitious 
names in making deposits. Concerning this, in actual practice, 
the bank knows the real identity of depositors who use 
fictitious names. 3. Reporting unusual account transfers.

  [Text] Ninety-nine Thai fishermen released by Vietnam after 
being arrested and detained for fishing inside Vietnamese 
territorial waters reached Samut Sakhon port on Friday night on 
three fishing boats that were seized with them. 
  Two of the fishermen returned with serious health problems. 
One is suffering from Aids and the other cannot walk due to 
atrophied legs. 
  Fifty of the 99 are the crew members of three fishing 
vessels, the Watcharin 1, Prasong Charoenchai, and Lim 
Charoenchai 3, from Samut Sakhon province. They were arrested by 
Vietnamese officials on Jan 29. 
  The Foreign Ministry negotiated with the Vietnamese 
government for the release of the crew members and the three 
boats on behalf of the boat owners. 
  The owners had to pay Vietnam US$800 for each of the 
returned 
fisherman. 
  Forty-nine other fishermen imprisoned earlier were released 
after Sanchat Thephatsadin, the Thai consul in Ho Chi Minh City, 
contacted the Vietnamese officials to pay the $800-per-person 
fine after no one else came forward to act on their behalf.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA June 28 -- A sea vessel named Truong Sa-10 
has been launched recently by the Ha Long shipyard. 
  The 70.75-metre-long and 11.8-metre-wide ship has a design 
capacity of 1,000 tonnes and is provided with modern equipment. 
  This transport ship was specially built in service of the 
Truong Sa archipelago [Spratlys]. 
  In the first half of this year, the Truong Sa Marine Product 
Company maintained the operation of all its ships. The company 
has well combined its tasks of economic production, scientific 
surveys and national defence. It discovered and prevented 
dozens of foreign vessels from illegally operating in the 
country's territorial waters and continental shelf.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA June 28 -- Party General Secretary Do 
Muoi received here this afternoon Lao Foreign Minister Somsavat 
Lengsavat who is on a visit to Vietnam. 
  The Lao chief diplomat conveyed regards from president of 
the 
Lao People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee Khamtai 
Siphandon to Mr. Do Muoi. 
  He also expressed his satisfaction at the development of the 
special friendship, fraternal solidarity and all-sided 
cooperation between the two parties, states and peoples. He 
affirmed that Laos always respected and strived for the constant 
consolidation and further promotion of those traditional 
relations. 
  Speaking to his guest, General Secretary Do Muoi welcomed 
the 
Lao foreign minister's visit and the results of the talks 
between the two foreign ministers. He said that the two sides 
should exchange views and experiences with each other,

strengthening the special friendship and comprehensive 
cooperation between Laos and Vietnam in the new period in the 
interest of each country for peace, stability, and development 
in the region and the rest the world.

Vietnamese Government and people in the implementation of the 
agreements reached at the recent Laos-Vietnam summit meeting,

  [Text] A delegation of the Vietnamese Government led by 
Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai on Sunday [26 June] 
concluded an official visit to Canada and Brazil. Upon his 
return to Hanoi, Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai, a member of the 
delegation, met with Vietnamese pressmen to inform them about 
the results of the visit. 
  Regarding the visit to Canada from June 15 to 22, Deputy 
Foreign Minister Le Mai said that the visit to Canada by 
Vietnamese Government delegation has achieved good results. It 
has contributed to the consolidation and development of the 
political and economic relations between the two countries. He 
said that Canada has strengthened its relations with Vietnam and 
supported the process of renovation in Vietnam. The two sides 
also agreed on mutual interest of the two countries in 
contributing to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. 
The agreement on development and cooperation between the two 
countries signed during the visit was the foundation for further 
development of relations between Canada and Vietnam. 
  During the meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, 
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien highly valued the current 
process of renovation in Vietnam and appreciated the invitation 
to visit Vietnam which would be made very soon. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai also laid stress on the great 
potential and prospect of economic and trade ties between 
Vietnam and Canada. He noted that the political relations 
between Vietnam and Canada were fine. However, the economic 
cooperation has not yet been equal to potential of the two 
nations. For further development, the two sides pledged to 
continue negotiations for an early signing of agreements at 
governmental level such as the agreements on commercial 
cooperation, on investment protection, and the avoidance of 
double taxation. At present, the Canadian Government is ready 
to exchange with Vietnam its experiences in economic development 
and to cooperate with Vietnam in many fields. 
  Canada is also considering the increase of quota of 
Vietnamese garments import. Especially, Canada expressed its 
will to help Vietnam enter the market in North America and the 
American Continent. Mr. Le Mai noted that this possibility 
would be realized. 
  In Canada now, there are about 150,000 overseas Vietnamese. 
The Vietnamese Government always considers them as a part of 
the Vietnamese nation. Today, overseas Vietnamese always want 
to contribute to national reconstruction according to their 
abilities. Mr. Le Mai said that the Vietnamese Government's 
policy toward Vietnamese overseas has been changed toward that 
direction. 
  After Canada, the Vietnamese Government delegation visited 
Brazil. This two-day official visit to Brazil concluded with 
positive outcome. Concerning the visit, Deputy Foreign Minister 
Le Mai said: During the meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Phan 
Van Khai, the Brazilian president and other senior officials 
expressed readiness to cooperate and exchange experiences with 
Vietnam in the development of key economic ventures. Brazil is 
also ready to receive Vietnamese students. Mr. Le Mai also said 
that many Brazilian businessmen met with the Vietnamese 
delegation and had working session to look for opportunity to do 
business in Vietnam. The Brazilian side is very interested in 
the development of football in Vietnam. 
  In conclusion, Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai said: Brazil 
shows its interest in assisting Vietnam in many fields including 
sports. It is clear that the visit to Brazil has ushered in a 
new set of development and cooperation between Vietnam and 
Brazil.

aimed at attaining national industrialization and modernization, 
the key task of our nation. They also urged that the central 
government pay more attention to formulating orientations for 
developing industries, building infrastructure, and improving 
conditions in the mountainous region, especially the central 
highlands. To advance further to achieving industrialization 
and modernization, the party and state should formulate plans to 
effectively train, manage, and use scientific-technological 
cadres, especially ethnic minority cadres. It is essential to 
formulate lines and policies to attract and encourage talented 
people in the mountainous region.

  [Text] According to a recent announcement of the 
Government Office, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet has expressed his 
views on the disciplinary measures against the director general 
of the Saigon Beer Company as follows: 
  While considering the degree of administrative measures and 
party disciplinary action against Comrade Hoang Chi Quy, one 
must take into full account the strong points and efforts of 
cadres and office and manual workers of the Saigon Beer Company 
to overcome difficulties. By upholding the spirit of 
self-reliance, everyone has stepped up production, enhanced the 
condition of production lines, expanded facilities, improved 
product quality and design, and combined production with 
marketing. As a result, the Saigon Beer Company has become one 
of those state business establishments that have made 
substantial contributions to the state budget over the past 
years. Comrade Hoang Chi Quy has positively contributed to the 
overall achievements of the company. 
  The shortcomings mentioned by the inspection team are 
related 
to management. Comrade Hoang Chi Quy and the Saigon Beer 
Company must be fully aware of those shortcomings and must take 
serious measures to rectify them. The Ministry of Light 
Industry must draw practical lessons from this incident to 
better direct the production and business operations of other 
units under its charge. 
  For the Saigon Beer Company to stabilize production and 
business operations at an early date, the prime minister of the 
Government has instructed the Ministry of Light Industry to use 
its cadre management power to determine the degree of 
administrative measures against Comrade Hoang Chi Quy and to 
bear responsibility before the Government for this action. 
  The party Central Committee Organ of Control is hereby 
requested to determine the degree of party disciplinary action 
to be taken against Comrade Hoang Chi Quy based on the party 
statutes and the views of the Ho Chi Minh City party committee 
standing body, the party affairs committee of the party 
organization of the Ministry of Light Industry, and the party 
installation of the Saigon Beer Company. 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet has requested the Ministry of 
Culture and Information in its capacity as a state organ in 
charge of press control to coordinate with the party Central 
Committee Ideology and Culture Department and Ho Chi Minh City 
in reviewing and drawing experiences from reports and articles 
relating to this incident, take action against cases of 
violations against the press code, and keep the prime minister 
of the government informed of investigation results.

  [Text] In the first six months of this year, Vietnam's 
economy has seen sound development. According to the Ministry 
of Trade, in the multisectoral economy, state commerce remains a 
key distributor of a number of essential items such as tin, 
cement, and petrol. This has helped balance supply and demand. 
  In the period under review, Vietnam's export turnover was 
1.6 
billion U.S. dollar, an increase of 27 percent against the same 
period last year, of which the turnover of rubber increased by 
28 percent, coffee 29 percent, tea 21 percent, and coal 24 
percent. 
  Meanwhile, Vietnam's import turnover in the last six months 
was recorded at 1.7 billion U.S. dollar. The main imports were 
those in service of production development and daily life such 
as petrol and pesticide. 
  Thanks to the production development, Vietnam has exported 
many items to foreign markets, including garment, crude oil, 
rice, maritime products, and tea. By now, Vietnam's Ministry of 
Trade has completed all necessary procedures to become an 
observer of GATT. It has signed trade agreements with Laos, 
Cambodia, and China and worked out plans for commercial 
promotion inside and outside of Vietnam.

<F P=106> [Article by a "Japan-U.S. relations reporting team"; seventh </F>
and last in series entitled "Japan and the United States -- The 
Picture Shakes": "The Swift Current Is Carrying the Economic 
Superpower Off its Footing"] 
  [Text] The book entitled "Global Engagement -- Cooperation 
and Global Security in the 21st Century," published by the U.S. 
Brookings Institute, is now very popular with U.S. diplomatic 
officials. In the chapter on the Asia-Pacific region, the book 
says, "During the past few years, Asia witnessed the end of the 
Cold War not once, but twice: the end of the antagonism between 
the United States and the Soviet Union, and the normalization of 
diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union." 
<H5>  For the United States, Is Improving its Relations With China </H5>
More Important Than Dealing With North Korea's Nuclear Issue? 
  The two events that marked the end of the Cold War brought 
about a breakaway from ideology and a relaxation of 
international friction. As a result, countries have begun to 
grope for new relations based on "economics." "This trend is 
even trying to normalize U.S.-Chinese diplomatic relations, 
despite the long dispute between the two countries over human 
rights and exports of Chinese-made weapons and ammunition," said 
a Mr. Harding [name as published], a researcher at the Brookings 
Institute. 
  On May 27, the day after U.S. President Bill Clinton 
announced his decision to renew China's most-favored-nation 
trade status, while breaking the link between human rights and 
trade, a meeting was held in New York by the Asia Society. U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher was invited to the meeting 
to give a lecture entitled "The Future of the United States and 
the Asia-Pacific." Although he first pointed out "the U.S. 
policy toward Asia is confronted with three pressing issues: 
the new development of the situation in China, North Korea's 
nuclear program, and the improvement of U.S.-Japan economic 
relations," he spent most of his time explaining the importance 
of strengthening U.S.-Chinese relations. As for Japan, he 
merely referred to it in connection with the North Korean issue. 
  Once the establishment of new international relations based 
on "economics" becomes the main trend of the times following the 
decline of power politics, this inevitably brings on a change in 
the psychological distance that exists between different 
countries: a once-distant nation may suddenly emerge as a close 
nation, and vice versa. In other words, this is the beginning 
of a "new shifting of nations." The remarkable advance being 
made by U.S. firms in China and other Asian nations is a good 
example. 
<H5>  A New World Called China </H5>
  General Electric Co., which is said to be the bellwether of 
U.S. business management, was the first to go into action. In 
the autumn of 1992, General Electric established its Asian 
headquarters in Hong Kong to supervise the region covering 
China, Southeast Asia, and India in line with the strategy of 
Chairman John F. Welch to "draw a demarcation line between Japan 
and the rest of Asia." In the case of American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph Co., the chief executive officer in charge of China 
was stationed in Beijing, while the CEO in charge of Southeast 
Asia was posted in Hong Kong. 
  If we look at how U.S.-Japan relations and U.S.-China 
relations changed in 1991, the year marked by the collapse of 
the Soviet Union, and in the following year of 1992, we can 
assess the psychological distance between the United States and 
China. In 1992, the total hours' duration of telephone calls 
made from the United States to China grew by 87.2 percent from a 
year earlier, while telephone calls made from the United States 
to Japan grew by only 14 percent. Concerning the total amount 
of direct investment in China on a contract basis, the United 
States moved quickly ahead of Japan in 1992. 
  The movement to convert government-controlled economies into 
market economies has spread throughout the world as another 
consequence of the end of the Cold War. 
  In the early 1980s, Nomura Securities Co. exerted 
overwhelming influence on the Chinese market. Well before the 
Tiananmen Incident, then-General Secretary Zhao Ziyang of the 
Chinese Communist Party had asked Masanori Ito to explain the 
Japanese capital market to him. At that time, Ito, who is now a 
senior advisor to Nomura Securities, was in charge of carrying 
out Nomura's policy toward China. Zhao had also asked American, 
British, and German experts to explain how matters stand in 
their own countries. Later, Zhao questioned Ito: "Given that 
Japan, the United States, Britain, and Germany are all 
capitalist nations, why do they have different systems?" 
  According to Ito, "Chinese people were eager to follow the 
example of Japan, as they are also an Asian people." 
  Japan Is Left Out in the Cold 
  However, what Ito said is now a thing of the past. The fact 
is that China seems to have chosen the United States as its 
model. In 1993, Merrill Lynch &amp; Company Inc. helped list 
Chinese companies' shares on the New York Stock Exchange. When 
its chief executive officer, Daniel P. Tully, went to China in 
March 1994 for the opening of its Beijing office, Chinese Prime 
Minister Li Peng directly asked him for assistance and advice in 
financial business. Meanwhile, a total of 22 Chinese companies 
are planning to list their shares on overseas stock exchanges 
after this summer. Many of them have already appointed 
U.S.-affiliated securities firms as their lead underwriters. 
  "If we remain idle, the entire world market will be 
Americanized," said senior managing director Katsuya Takanashi 
of Nomura Securities, with great anxiety. This spring, the 
Tokyo Stock Exchange sent delegates to China after it realized 
that an overseas listing boom was on among Chinese companies. 
However, since China decided to follow the example of the 
United States, there were no companies willing to list their 
shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. 
  The number of foreign issues listed on the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange, which reached its peak of 127 in 1991, is expected to 
decline to 97 by the end of June, as many U.S. companies, such 
as General Motors Corp., are delisting one after the other. The 
closedness of the Japanese capital market is cited by the U.S. 
side as a cause of foreign delistings. However, if Japan 
considers the recent move by U.S. companies to be merely a 
result of the trade friction between Japan and the United 
States, there is a possibility that Japan might be left out of 
the worldwide trend toward market economies. 
  If the United States is really determined to give 
consideration to economic interests before fundamental rules, 
with its President acting as a "vehicle," Japan, which has 
always viewed the world through the United States, will 
certainly become bankrupt in policy. To avoid such a situation, 
Japan had better begin reviewing its relations with the United 
States, based on a simple viewpoint that, after all, the United 
States of today is a "nation that changes its relations with 
other nations eaasily."

<F P=106> [Interview with Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa by </F>
Jean-Pierre Langellier and Philippe Pons in Tokyo; date not 
given: "`We Can Make a Positive Contribution' Within the UN 
Security Council"] 
  [Text] [LE MONDE] Following the announcement of a summit 
between the presidents of the two Koreas, you expressed a 
certain skepticism on the results of such a meeting. Why? 
  [Kakizawa] I am not totally skeptical. We are in favor of 
the initiative. It is a constructive proposal. But I do not 
share the optimism of those who say that the issue has now been 
resolved. Further details are required concerning the agreement 
reached between the U.S. and North Korean leaders. There are 
still ambiguous or vague points which must be cleared up. For 
example, what exactly is meant by "freezing" the nuclear 
program? Similarly, with regard to the guarantees, do the 
promises made to the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] 
also involve the reprocessing installations to which Pyongyang 
has so far denied access? These are fundamental questions. 
  [LE MONDE] The Japanese press reports that Prime Minister 
Hata declared that "North Korea probably has no nuclear weapons" 
and that its refusal to grant inspections of its nuclear sites 
is due to "a desire not to succumb to external blackmail." Do 
you share this opinion? 
  [Kakizawa] That is not the idea Mr. Hata was seeking to 
express. He simply pointed out that President Kim Il-song 
stated that he does not want nuclear weapons and that he lacks 
the economic capacity to conduct such a program. Mr. Hata was 
simply expressing his hope that these words were well-founded. 
In any event, we do not know if Pyongyang already has the bomb 
or if it wants to have one. 
  [LE MONDE] How do you interpret the behavior of the North 
Korean leaders? Have they made mistakes or are they pursuing a 
subtle strategy? 
  [Kakizawa] I believe they are playing a quite intelligent 
game. They probably already have reprocessing installations. 
Would they need such equipment if it was simply for a civil 
program? It is doubtful. I think they are playing for time. 
Is it not odd that Kim Il-song is thinking -- as he said to 
Mrs. Miki, the wife of the former Japanese premier -- of a 
meeting with the South Korean president on 15 August? I find 
this rather late for a meeting which it was said should take 
place "as soon as possible." 
  [LE MONDE] North Korea is in the process of achieving one of 
its aims: With Mr. Carter's visit, it obtained direct dialogue 
with the United States. Is this not already a success? 
  [Kakizawa] This is true. It is a diplomatic success. But 
North Korea's ultimate aim is to normalize relations with the 
United States and obtain an undertaking from Washington not to 
use force against Pyongyang. 
  [LE MONDE] In your opinion, what sanctions should be imposed 
against North Korea? 
  [Kakizawa] They must be progressive. They should not be 
seen as a punishment but as concerted pressure in order to 
induce Pyongyang to return to the Nonproliferation Treaty and to 
ensure that it respects the IAEA provisions. North Korea must 
not feel threatened by sanctions which are an expression of 
international solidarity. 
  [LE MONDE] Is China's position of crucial importance in 
finding a solution to this crisis? 
  [Kakizawa] Most certainly. China's support is essential if 
sanctions are to prove effective. If it refuses to apply its 
sanctions (that is, in its case, to suspend border trade with 
Pyongyang) the effect will be practically nil, even if Japan 
stops North Koreans living on the island from sending money home. 
  [LE MONDE] This crisis once again shows the limits to 
Japan's 
ability to intervene on the international stage. Although this 
time the crisis is on its very doorstep, it could not have been 
a party to military measures. Yet one of Japan's aims is to 
become a permanent member of the UN Security Council. What 
constitutional changes would allow Japan to assume the 
responsibilities that come with such a status? 
  [Kakizawa] A revision of the Constitution is not a necessary 
condition for Japan's entry into the Security Council as a 
permanent member. The intervention of UN peacekeeping forces 
for which Japan may possibly supply troops must, we believe, 
remain quite limited. These forces must remain neutral and limit 
themselves to surveillance activities. Our Constitution does 
not provide an obstacle within such a framework. 
  [LE MONDE] Bearing in mind its constraints, what could 
Japan's role be within the Security Council? 
  [Kakizawa] It could make a positive contribution on several 
levels. First of all, financial. Who pays for the operations? 
First the United States and then Japan. We fully accept this 
funding responsibility. Yet the United States seems to want to 
reduce its contribution. Is that because France is willing to 
contribute more? That would surprise me. If it becomes a 
permanent member, Japan is prepared to assume a higher financial 
burden. Also, precisely because of the pacifist commitments in 
the Constitution, Japan may seek to influence the UN role more 
clearly toward preventive diplomacy. As was the case in 
Cambodia. 
  Finally, Japan will be the only country in the Council not 
to 
have nuclear weapons. It will therefore be well placed to 
exercise its influence with a view to reducing nuclear weapons. 
As long as the Council continues to consist of countries with a 
nuclear capability that are logically seeking to maintain their 
military supremacy, no progress will be possible. 
  [LE MONDE] When could Japan join the Council? 
  [Kakizawa] In 1995, the United Nations will be celebrating 
its 50th anniversary and there is talk of changing the Charter. 
The United States and some 50 other countries are in favor of 
Japanese membership. We are aware of the positive stance taken 
by France on this question. But some of your leaders express 
doubts on our ability to assume the responsibilities of a 
permanent member. The statements by [French Foreign Minister] 
Juppe are encouraging, but President Mitterrand seems to have 
reservations. 
  [LE MONDE] Some countries fear that the presence of Japan as 
a permanent member of the Security Council would produce, due to 
the links between Washington and Tokyo, a second U.S. voice? 
  [Kakizawa] I do not believe so. I believe that we will 
demonstrate our independence. China is already a permanent 
member but does it represent Asia? It is a rather special case. 
On the other hand, Japan could no doubt better represent the 
region within the Council. 
  [LE MONDE] That is the sensitive issue due to the scars of 
history. Do you think that these countries really want to be 
represented by Japan? 
  [Kakizawa] I do not know if they want to be or not, but they 
must face reality. Interdependence between Japan and Southeast 
Asia is becoming increasingly close. Everybody believes that an 
increased role for Japan is essential. Following the statements 
by the former Japanese justice minister denying that the Nankin 
massacre in 1937 ever took place, China and Korea reacted, but 
they do so calmly. Japan must certainly not forget the past, 
but above all we must make more effort to build the future. 
  [LE MONDE] What do you think of Mr. Clinton's policy in 
Asia? 
  [Kakizawa] The new team did not have a great deal of 
diplomatic experience. Today, I believe that Washington has 
become aware of the Asian situation. With regard to China, he 
has realized that his own values cannot be too brutally imposed. 
Human rights must be respected by the Chinese Government, but 
progress must be gradual. On this point the Clinton 
administration has become more realistic. 
  With regard to Japan, the United States first imposed its 
quantified targets for reducing its trade surplus. It then 
became more reasonable in order to avoid trade conflicts. If 
economic relations were to deteriorate, political links would 
also be affected. The direction taken by the United States is 
favorable to the renewal of mutual confidence.

  [Text] On 25 June, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] 
issued a "report on evaluation of economic cooperation," 
concerning effects achieved in those countries receiving 
Official Development Assistance (ODA) funds. The report states 
"projects as a whole have achieved desirable results." However, 
it also points out the need for conducting a preliminary study 
of problems connected with individual projects. 
  The survey was conducted in fiscal 1992 for a total of 159 
projects carried out in 46 countries. In addition to Japanese 
diplomatic missions in foreign countries and the Japan 
International Cooperation Agency, civilian experts and 
organizations were invited to take part in the survey. Among 
future tasks listed in the report are: how to grasp accurately 
the needs of recipient countries; how to settle the issue 
concerning management shortages, training, and other funds, 
after the completion of projects; and how to help them improve 
the management system. 
  The report cites various problems connected with individual 
projects. For example, a considerable number of facilities 
built in suburban Islamabad, Pakistan for rural area development 
have been left unutilized, and the X-ray film developing 
equipment provided for promoting the anti-tuberculosis campaign 
in Yemen has not been used for over two years.

  [Text] Movements in the foreign exchange market, which 
resulted in the dollar dropping below the 100 yen mark, have 
imposed a new burden on the conference of the seven principal 
nations' finance ministers and central bank presidents (G-7) 
which aims to put the world economy on a course of stable 
expansion. Up to this point, the strong yen reflected "political 
pricing" influenced by statements of high-ranking U.S. 
Government officials, but this time the major difference is that 
the strong yen has been triggered by fears of U.S. inflation and 
changes in economic trends encompassing an economic recovery in 
Japan and Europe. Japan and Europe take the position that the 
United States must raise its interest rates to calm fears of 
incipient inflation, but the U.S. Government is cautious out of 
fear that such a move could interrupt the economic recovery. It 
appears that the near-term focus will be on whether differences 
in views among the respective nations can be coordinated at the 
conference of principal nations (Naples summit) in early July. 
  A factor underlying the recent weakness in the dollar is a 
move to reduce interest differentials between the United States 
and Germany. At the beginning of the year, the market rate on 
30-year government bonds which serves as a barometer was at 6.3 
percent, but recently has risen to around 7.5 percent. On the 
other hand, the German economy recently showed signs of hitting 
bottom and market interest rates on 10-year government bonds, 
which stood at 5.7 percent at the beginning of the year, 
recently rose to 7.3 percent. Interest rate differentials 
between the two nations, which stood at about 1 percent in the 
spring, have shrunk to about 0.2 percent. 
  Such trends have recently encouraged money that was 
concentrated in dollar-denominated assets to shift to European 
investments such as mark-denominated assets, causing the recent 
weak dollar-strong mark relationship. Further, the rise in crude 
oil and grain markets because of the favorable U.S. economic 
climate has magnified fears of inflation. Moves to buy marks 
have also influenced similar moves in yen-denominated assets, 
leading to the recent strong yen. 
  Market intervention in this cycle has been limited to 
actions 
by the Bank of Japan and the expected intervention by the 
Federal Reserve Board did not take place, accelerating the 
disposal of dollars while reflecting a lack of any effective 
measures by the G-7. Further, the quick break in the value of 
the dollar at 100 yen which was believed to be a line of 
resistance symbolized the fragility of any cooperative actions 
to support monetary values. 
  In the near term, the focus will be on whether the G-7 
nations will be able to take coordinated intervention action in 
currency markets. There is the view in certain quarters such as 
that held by former Ministry of Finance official Makoto Utsumi: 
"The United States should be formulating tactics and strategy to 
respond appropriately to speculators." On the other hand, 
opinions exist such as that of Managing Director Toshiaki 
Kakimoto of the Japan Research Institute, who says, "If the 
United States is unable to formulate appropriate tactics and 
strategy, the weakness in the dollar will persist." 
  On a medium- and long-term basis the markets reflect the 
view 
that "the U.S. Government has failed in its efforts to calm 
fears of inflation," and unless the U.S. authorities quickly 
prepare clear-cut inflationary measures, pressure to sell the 
dollar will remain. 
  It appears that Japan and Europe will express the view at 
the 
Naples summit that the United States needs to implement a fifth 
series of interest hikes. The United States fears a decline on 
three fronts--including stocks and bonds as well as the 
dollar--causing it to be cautious and posing difficulties for 
any coordinated action. 
  On the other hand, Japan has already played its financial 
and 
fiscal policy cards and manifests conspicuous signs of striking 
a barrier. It is unclear as to what responses it can effectively 
formulate in the face of political turmoil.

<F P=106> [From Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN 27 Jun Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] On 26 June, a government source disclosed that the 
OECD plans to convene a meeting of a joint committee on 
information-related matters in Paris on 28-29 June to begin work 
on drawing up an international high-speed communications network 
project. The OECD plans to look into establishing a social 
infrastructure that befits an era of a highly advanced 
information-oriented society, basing its plans primarily on the 
following points: 1) to coordinate policies, including the 
promotion of deregulation programs; 2) to revise existing 
systems regarding such matters as intellectual property rights; 
and 3) to promote the establishment of industry standards and 
development of databases. The OECD plans to compile a report on 
this project at a ministerial meeting in June 1995. The project 
has drawn much attention as an effort to help realize the 
"Global Information Highway Initiative (GII)," an expanded 
version of the "National Information Super Highway Initiative," 
which has been announced by the administration of U.S President 
Bill Clinton. 
  The OECD's joint committee consists of three separate 
committees: one deals with industrial affairs; another with 
information and computer communications policies; and the third 
with scientific and technological policies. The fact that the 
OECD has decided to convene a joint committee meeting indicates 
that the issue of how high-speed communications networks ought 
to work has become a priority issue among major industrialized 
nations. 
  So far, the United States has promoted its "NII," which was 
proposed by U.S. Vice President Al Gore. European nations have 
proposed the "Trans-European Network (TEN)" project. As for 
Japan, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has 
announced that the nation plans to participate in the "GII," 
which has been proposed by the United States. At the same time, 
Japan has also proposed the "Asia Information Highway Initiative 
(AII)." However, there never has been an opportunity for 
countries to hold comprehensive debates on policies related to 
an international high-speed communications network project. 
  At the joint committee meeting, committee members will hold 
discussions on how to promote international cooperation 
regarding deregulation in certain areas that will be 
indispensable toward expanding communications networks. Such 
efforts will be directed toward facilitating access to data 
communications businesses and determining how networks ought to 
be mutually connected, among other goals. Committee members 
will also hold discussions on how copyrights ought to be 
protected in connection with users' editing and processing 
visual and audio data which they have acquired through 
multimedia networks and on other problems related to existing 
systems which govern such matters. 
  Moreover, committee members will exchange opinions as to 
what 
measures ought be taken to make specific improvements on 
international high-speed communications networks which primarily 
deal with scientific and technological information and to 
promote the establishment of standards among networks regarding 
such matters as data processing. 
  In conjunction with such moves, Japan plans to set up soon 
an 
"Advanced Data Communications Promotion Headquarters" (tentative 
name) within the cabinet, which will hopefully compile a 
Japanese version of the "Information Super Highway" project 
right away. It then plans to participate actively in debates 
with other OECD member nations on the global communications 
network project.

  [Text] On 20 June, Mitsubishi Group's telecommunication 
satellite company, Space Communication Corporation 
(SCC--Shinagawa ward, Tokyo; president, Yoshio Taniguchi), 
announced that it is considering a joint venture with U.S. 
satellite telecommunication company Orion for the launching of 
its third satellite. SCC is studying the advisability of joint 
ownership of satellite facilities as well as contracting with 
Orion for the sale of circuits in the Asian market. The 
launching of a single satellite costs over 30 billion yen and 
SCC's intent in this case appears to be an effort to reduce 
costs and risks through a joint venture with a U.S. firm and to 
boost its global sales capabilities. 
  SCC plans to launch its third satellite in December 1997. A 
proposal has been presented for the joint ownership of 
transponders to be loaded on the third satellite and Orion has 
already proposed a specific number of transponders to be loaded 
on the satellite. President Taniguchi indicates, "We would like 
to make our decision by yearend on whether we will proceed with 
the joint venture." 
  Currently, Japanese telecommunication satellite operators 
are 
restricted to domestic services only, but approval to provide 
international services is expected to be issued in the fall. SCC 
will enter the international market with the launching of the 
third satellite, but past satellite accidents have caused 
financial difficulties for the firm, leading it to consider the 
joint venture route with a U.S. firm. 
  Rival Japan Satellite Systems (JSAT) plans to enter the 
international market with the launching of its third satellite 
in August 1995.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] will hold a large-scale 3-day economic seminar from 28 to 
30 June in Chengdu city, Sichuan Province, to cooperate with 
China in the economic development of China's inland areas. 
Viewing the same province as a model case of developing inland 
areas, the MITI, together with Chinese Government officials, 
will study support measures, including reconstruction of old 
factories and agricultural technological cooperation. The MITI 
will send 50 officials -- specialists in such areas as trade, 
electric power, financing, and agricultural technology -- to the 
seminar. The population of Sichuan is about 120 million. 
Although it is the largest of all provinces, there is a growing 
gap in income between Sichuan and coastal provinces due to a 
delay in the development of basic industries in Sichuan. Public 
security in Sichuan is also worsening. Therefore the MITI also 
wants to improve business conditions for Japanese corporations 
by trying to correct the economic gap by cooperating with China 
in developing its industries. The MITI is saying that "the 
seminar will be the first step toward our full-fledged economic 
cooperation in the inland areas." 
  The seminar will be held jointly by the Association for 
International Study and Exchanges, which is the MITI's 
extra-governmental organization, and China's National Economic 
System Reform Committee. Through panel discussions and 
subcommittee meetings on such topics as investment and 
industrial cooperation, and energy and environment, they plan to 
formulate support measures for the reconstruction of old 
facilities, including iron mills, and improving the efficiency 
of agricultural management in China.

  [Text] Leading Japanese trading companies will be offering 
pager services in India. Itochu will form a joint venture with 
fifth-ranking business giant Goenka Group and plans on providing 
pager services in principal Indian cities including New Delhi. 
Mitsui and Company will initiate manufacture and sales of pocket 
pagers in India. India is in the process of deregulating its 
telecommunications markets and trading firms hope to expand into 
the cellular communications sector. 
  Itochu and the Goenka Group will form a joint venture 
located 
in New Delhi at the end of the year. The venture has already 
received informal approval for pager services from the Indian 
Government, but a decision on capitalization and share ownership 
is awaiting a determination on the geographical scope of 
operations. For the short term, it will sell pagers and provide 
services to corporations and middle-class individuals in the New 
Delhi area. 
  Currently, a study is underway to reach a decision on 
whether 
to import pagers made by Japanese communications equipment 
manufacturers or to assemble pagers in India. 
  Mitsui and Company will begin assembly of pagers in India in 
the fall of this year. A contract has been issued to a private 
telephone manufacturer in New Delhi for the production of pagers 
at the rate of 1-2 million units a year for sale to Indian 
domestic pager companies. Telephone installations in India sit 
at a low rate of 0.6 per hundred population, providing the stage 
for explosive expansion in the mobile telecommunication market.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] plans to introduce a new export regulation system for 
about 100 general-purpose items, including machinery and 
materials, by the end of this year in an effort to prevent 
proliferation of mass-destruction weapons such as nuclear arms. 
Under the system, companies that plan to export general-purpose 
goods to 20 countries considered to be areas of potential 
conflict, including the DPRK (North Korea), have to obtain 
permission from MITI if their exports come under MITI's 
standards. Since there are growing concerns over proliferation 
of weapons of mass-destruction following the collapse of the 
Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), 
Japan will follow the example of European countries and the 
United States in expanding export regulations to general-purpose 
goods. MITI intends to revise the Export Trade Control 
Ordinance as early as August, and to introduce the new system 
after making it known to companies. 
  Among about 100 items subject to export regulations are: 
computers; semiconductors; machinery, including low precision 
machine tools; special metals such as zirconium and beryllium; 
and carbon fiber. MITI is studying the possibility of 
designating about 20 nations -- including North Korea, Iran, 
Iraq, Libya, and former communist nations -- as being subject to 
export regulations. 
  Standards to be adopted by MITI are mainly comprised of the 
following three cases: 1) General-purpose goods are exported to 
such facilities as nuclear power plants at which exported goods 
may possibly be used to produce weapons; 2) companies themselves 
are aware of the possibility that exported goods may be 
transformed into weapons; and 3) even though companies judge 
that there is no problem with exports, the government notices a 
danger that exported goods could be transformed into weapons. 
For example, in case a Japanese company -- which plans to 
export semiconductors to Iraq -- is aware of the possibility 
that its semiconductors may be used to produce weapons, it has 
to submit an application to MITI for permission. 
  If all 100 items require permission to be exported, 
companies 
will have to bear a heavy burden and MITI will face difficulties 
in examining many applications. For this reason, MITI has 
decided to place emphasis of regulations on the possibility that 
exported goods may be transformed into weapons. Nevertheless, 
since export regulations will be applied to general-purpose 
goods, companies need to strengthen their export control system. 
  Industrialized nations, including Japan, and other countries 
have adopted international regulations on exports of 
highly-precise machine tools and pathogenic bacteria which could 
be directly used to produce weapons of mass-destruction such as 
nuclear arms and missiles. However, because such goods as low 
precision machine tools are also used to produce weapons, MITI 
has decided to regulate exports of these general-purpose goods. 
  The United States, United Kingdom, and Germany have already 
introduced a similar system. According to their system, if a 
company "is aware that its exported goods will be used to 
produce weapons of mass-destruction in the end, it is required 
to get permission" to export them. This is called the "know 
control" system. Although MITI has partially introduced the 
"know control" system into its new system, it has made standards 
of its system clearer than is the "know control" system by 
designating importers as subject to export permission.

<F P=106> [By Arisa Yoshida, Tokyo Economic Division reporter] </F>
  [Text] In March 1994, several leading U.S. banks reached 
agreements with Japanese city banks, long-term credit banks, and 
trust banks to engage in netting services relative to foreign 
currency transactions. The reason why the banks acted in unison 
was that a requirement existed to sign formal agreements before 
the end of the fiscal year ending in March in connection with 
changes in U.S. accounting standards to gain approval of the 
netting services. A planning specialist at a leading U.S. bank 
breathed a sigh of relief as he said, "We finally gained 
approval of an agreement which had been held in abeyance at the 
Ministry of Finance [MOF]." 
  The netting agreements involve the offsetting of debits 
against credits and settlement of remaining balances in the case 
of bankrupt clients. The ability exists to minimize risks 
because of the small settlement amounts. However, if the legal 
basis for the netting agreement is not recognized and the 
receiver executes only those transactions that are beneficial to 
the bankrupt firm, the risk-reduction effects of the system will 
be lost to the bank. 
  Accordingly, establishment of a netting agreement calls for 
the premise that the agreement is recognized as being legal. 
Japanese banks have signed agreements on the basis that they 
have the commitment of the MOF that the agreements are legally 
valid, but U.S. banks embrace a deeply rooted fear over the fact 
that the commitment is not issued in writing. The reason for the 
fear is that U.S. banks have experienced meandering negotiations 
with Japanese banks which involved the taxing experience of 
carefully observing and being influenced by MOF posturing. 
  "A U.S. bank has approached with a proposal to establish a 
netting agreement. Is it permissible to sign the agreement?" was 
the question posed by an attendee from a Japanese bank at a 
seminar on netting conducted in December 1993 by a department 
head of the MOF International Finance Bureau. The department 
head replied, "We have informed the U.S. banking authorities 
that the legality of netting agreements is being studied jointly 
with the Ministry of Justice [MOJ] and we are now awaiting a 
response from U.S. authorities," and the attending bankers 
reached the understanding that "such agreements should not be 
signed." 
  U.S. banks had already signed netting agreements with 
principal European banks, but viewed the situation as signifying 
that agreements with Japanese banks were being held in abeyance. 
Alarmed, U.S. banks appealed through the Federal Reserve Board 
(FRB) and about two weeks later, the MOF announced that "a reply 
has been received from the FRB," and approved agreements with 
Japanese banks. An attorney with a U.S. bank points out that, 
"Banks should be empowered to assess the merits of a private 
agreement on netting, but in the case of Japanese banks, the MOF 
exercises absolute authority." 
  After the New Year, the MOF obtained the interpretation from 
the Ministry of Justice that the netting agreements were legally 
valid and conveyed that interpretation orally. During a 
Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan seminar in March, 
two department heads in charge of netting gave presentations on 
the legality of the system. Guidance furnished in that format 
was used by Japanese banks in concluding agreements with U.S. 
banks. 
  However, the Japanese situation which lacks legislative 
backing appears fragile in comparison with the U.S. situation in 
which the infrastructure was strengthened through the revision 
of related legislation such as bankruptcy laws. In view of the 
increased emphasis placed on U.S. banks' risks associated with 
off-balance-sheet transactions such as for foreign currency 
futures, U.S. banks strongly desire that the Japanese legal 
system should be strong enough to convince U.S. banking 
authorities. In the case of Britain, which set aside legal 
measures, currency authorities took the initiative in arranging 
for private advisory agencies to issue legal interpretations. 
U.S. banks have advocated the need for the MOF "to document its 
commitment in a way that explains the legal basis for its 
decisions." 
  As far as the MOF is concerned the legal issue concerning 
netting has been resolved and it has no intention of issuing new 
documentation. The International Finance Bureau reasons that "it 
is not in a position to issue bulletins or ordinances concerning 
the bankruptcy law over which it has no jurisdiction." The Bank 
for International Settlements (BIS) provides as a condition for 
recognizing netting as a means of regulating net worth "the 
existence of a legal opinion in writing," but the MOF has 
decided that the requirement has been satisfied. The MOF takes 
the position that it has explained the Japanese legal situation 
in consultations with the BIS and that it has no further 
obligation. 
  The problem is that the MOF is in a position to influence 
the 
decisions of Japanese banks on matters that exceed its actual 
authority. The U.S. argument is that, "as long as the MOF 
restricts the actions of Japanese banks, we would like to see 
the legal basis in documentary form." There's also a problem 
with the attitude of Japanese banks. The reason is that Japanese 
banks rely completely on government authorities and make no 
self-protective efforts relative to legal risks such as securing 
opinions from law offices as done by U.S. banks. 
  Underlying U.S. demands is criticism of "relationships 
between Japanese banks and supervisory authorities which are not 
clearly defined by existing rules and responsibilities." Foreign 
banks are not able to tolerate the arrangement wherein the MOF 
fails to issue documented guidance, but banks decide on the 
merits of transactions based on the posture taken by the MOF, 
which action the MOF expects of banks. Obscure regulations were 
supposed to have been eliminated because of financial scandals, 
but opinion is widespread that much remains to be accomplished, 
and a resolution of demands for financial deregulating actions 
cannot be attained unless both the government and private sector 
reform the Japanese way of doing business.

<F P=106> [Contents of the final draft of the Outline of Deregulation </F>
Measures compiled by the Administrative Reform Promotion 
Headquarters] 
  [Text] The final draft of the Outline of Deregulation 
Measures ("Concerning the Promotion of Deregulation in the 
Future") to be released on 29 June by the Administrative Reform 
Promotion Headquarters of the government follows: 
  1. Promotion of priority deregulation, etc. (details 
omitted) 
  (1) Housing and land (details omitted) 
  (2) Information and communications (details omitted) 
  (3) Promotion of imports; improvement of access to markets; 
distribution, etc. (details omitted) 
  (4) Banking, securities and insurance (details omitted) 
  2. Formulation of the deregulation promotion plan 
(tentatively named) 
  (1) In addition to No. 1 above, further promotion of 
deregulation is to be carried out positively and systematically 
on the basis of the results of past deregulation measures; and 
"the deregulation promotion plan" (tentatively named) is to be 
formulated in 1994, which will be carried out for a period of 
five years. 
  (2) In formulating the plan, the following basic principles 
will be adopted: 
  (a) The regulation providing entry and equipment, which is 
being enforced from the standpoint of the adjustment of supply 
and demand, will be abolished in principle. 
  Concerning other regulations providing for entry and 
equipment, etc., in order to prevent undue restraints on entry, 
those regulations will be centered on qualification and 
technology, and the requirements will be reduced to the minimum. 
  (b) Concerning the regulation of public utilities charges, 
its subjects will be limited to goods and services of minimum 
necessity; the competitive environment will be improved and the 
efficiency of management will be promoted; and at the same time, 
the examination of the way of setting prices and the 
diversification and flexibility of prices will be promoted, 
considering the contents and character of businesses. 
  (c) Concerning regulations which are being enforced on the 
basis of international common rules, no regulations exceeding 
the limit of international common rules will be enforced. 
  Moreover, regulations, except those which are peculiar to 
Japan and which are proved to be necessary, will be subject to 
international conformity, and elements which hinder the entry of 
foreign businesses and foreign commodities into Japan's markets 
will be eliminated. 
  (d) Concerning regulations which are being enforced for the 
protection of consumers, the principle of self-responsibility 
will be emphasized, and regulations of minimum necessity in 
scope and content will be enforced on the basis of the 
development of technology and the propagation of knowledge among 
consumers. 
  Concerning regulations which are being enforced for the 
preservation of safety and the environment, they too will be of 
minimum necessity. 
  (e) Concerning standards, certification systems, and display 
systems, international conformity will be applied with regard to 
standards, contents, and methods; and, in principle, the 
acceptance of foreign data as well as the introduction of mutual 
certification systems will be promoted. 
  (f) Concerning official inspections imposed at the time of 
importation, domestic sales and domestic use, inspection and 
certification standards will be the same as (e) above; and 
standards which are applied repeatedly to the same objects on 
the basis of various laws and regulations will be subject to 
standard conformity and the elimination of double inspections 
will be promoted. 
  (g) Necessary accumulation as well as clarification of data, 
etc., will be promoted with respect to examination standards, 
inspection standards and application, etc., of permission and 
approval; and at the same time, a clear statement of normal time 
for disposal will be promoted. 
  (3) The reduction of expenses borne by the public in making 
  notification and reports, etc. 
  As part of the deregulaltion promotion plan mentioned in (1) 
above, the reduction of expenses borne by the public in making 
notification and reports, etc., will be promoted. In doing 
this, the indexes, etc., with regard to bearing the cost of 
making notification and reports, etc. will be examined; and the 
following will be positively promoted: the abolition of making 
notification and reports, etc.; the switching over of making 
notification and reports, etc. to keeping records; the reduction 
of the frequency of making reports; electronic recording, etc. 
of information. 
  (4) Reconsideration of the regulations under the 
jurisdiction of each ministry and agency 
  Each ministry and agency will, in 1994, reconsider the main 
regulations under its own jurisdiction according to the basic 
principles mentioned in (2) above. Furthermore, those 
regulations that have not become the subjects of reconsideration 
in 1994 will be reconsidered afterward. 
  3. Positive development of competition policy 
  To make Japan's markets competitive and open, through 
further 
promotion of fair and free competition, the rigid, exact 
application of the Antimonopoly Law will be continually promoted 
according to the past principles, and at the same time, the 
positive development of competition policy will be accelerated; 
and as a part of that endeavor, the following measures will be 
taken: 
  (1) Concerning the cartel and other systems which are exempt 
from the application of the Antimonopoly Law under separate 
laws, they will be abolished in principle within five years, and 
a concrete conclusion will be drawn by the end of 1995. 
  Concerning the resale price maintenance system, designated 
commodity items will be completely removed by the end of 1998, 
and the scope of literary works will be defined and clarified. 
  (2) Concerning the regulation on gifts, the notification of 
the Fair Trade Commission with regard to sales of gifts 
conducted by department stores as well as the upper limits, 
etc., of gift prices classified by the modes of offering gifts 
will be reconsidered in 1995. 
  (3) Details omitted. 
  (4) Concerning the regulation on holding companies, the 
proper application of the regulation will be promoted according 
to the spirit of the regulation that the excessive concentration 
of business dominance should be prevented in order to make 
Japan's markets more open and to make the business activity of 
entrepreneurs active. Moreover, the guidelines for the sphere 
of activity, etc. permissiblefor venture capital will be 
reconsidered in 1994. 
  4. Improvement of the follow-up of deregulation 
  To promote the steady implementation of the past 
deregulation 
measures in addition to those mentioned in 1 above, improvement 
of the follow-up concerning the situation of implementation of 
each measure will be promoted. In doing this, the 
administrative inspection function will be actively utilized. 
  Moreover, the results of the first follow-up of the 
deregulation measures under 1 above will be complied by the end 
of this year and will be released. 
  5. Actively grasp the opinions and requests within and 
without Japan concerning deregulation (details omitted) 
  6. Steady implementation of the past measures (details 
omitted)

  [Text] The government announced the results of its 
estimate of the effect of public investment and deregulation on 
economic growth and employment. The estimate says deregulation 
will push the real annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth 
rate up by an average of 0.5 percent points, while 100 trillion 
yen in additional public investment will push the GDP growth 
rate up by 0.3 percent. However, deregulation is expected to 
result in 1.2 million less jobs, particularly in the 
distribution sector, and in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. 
  The government's calculations considered four hypothetical 
cases: 1) Deregulation is not implemented and no additional 
public investment on top of the current public investment 
program (430 trillion yen over 10 years); 2) an additional 100 
trillion yen in investment alone is implemented; 3) only 
deregulation is implemented; and 4) both additional public 
investment and deregulation are implemented. It proceeded to 
compute sector-by- sector production volume and demand for labor 
up to the year 2000 using the interindustry relations table. 
  In this process, the effects of deregulation were considered 
difficult to quantify. Therefore, calculations were made on the 
assumption that through market liberalization and easing of the 
licensing and permit systems, the price gap with the major 
advanced nations is eliminated, and the productivity of primary 
industries and the distribution sector is raised to a level 
comparable to the European countries and United States by the 
year 2000. 
  According to government calculations, in case 1) real GDP 
growth rate will be 2.3 percent. In terms of demand and supply 
in the labor market, while labor supply will be 67.79 million in 
2000, according to the Management and Coordination Agency's 
estimate, demand will remain at 67.3 million, rendering 490,000 
workers superfluous. 
  In case 3) where deregulation is implemented, GDP will grow 
by 2.8 percent due to the expansion of personal consumption as a 
result of narrowing down the price gap between Japan and foreign 
countries. At the same time, increased efficiency in the primary 
industries and the distribution industry -- covering both 
retailers and wholesalers -- demand for labor will be 66.1 
million, 1.2 million less than in the case of non-implementation 
of deregulation. 
  On the other hand, if additional public investment alone is 
implemented, an annual economic growth rate of 2.6 percent can 
be attained, and demand for labor will be 68.76 million. 
However, the government's analysis says that in this case, 
policies to protect industries with low productivity will 
remain, and the trade surplus will not be reduced substantially. 
  Therefore, the government's analysis stresses that both 
deregulation and public investment should be implemented to 
enable stable growth at an annual rate of 3 percent. In terms 
of labor demand and supply, the labor force will move from 
industries which are inefficient, compared to other countries, 
to industries with growth potentials. The estimate places labor 
demand at 67.56 million, roughly on par with labor supply (67.79 
million).

<F P=106> [Article by Seita Sakamoto, NIKKEI KINYU reporter in London] </F>
  [Text] Japanese banks such as city banks have begun to seek 
Europe's Asia business via their European branches, owing to 
sluggish growth of loans in Europe. They are selling themselves 
as "Asian banks" with the goal of winning the business of major 
European companies with stepped-up enthusiasm for entering the 
Asian markets," while sparing no effort in developing ideas for 
investment in Asian projects on the part of European firms. 
Among Japanese banks striving to survive in London's 
international financial markets, "Asia" has become a password. 
  "Asian Seminars" targeting local European firms by Japanese 
banks are being conducted on a fairly active basis. Such 
seminars have been held in London by the Industrial Bank of 
Japan in February and by the Bank of Tokyo in May, and in London 
and Paris by Sanwa Bank. 
  Seminars have included lectures on economic trends in China 
and ASEAN nations by instructors such as the former head of a 
Beijing branch office. Noticeable are attendees from large 
companies such as British Petroleum (BP) and British Gas. The 
seminars are used to impress upon participating firms that the 
banks play a "dominant role in the Asian market." 
  The move by Japanese banks to vocally stress that they are 
"Asian banks" was inspired by the intensification of actions by 
major European firms to reduce the number of banks with which 
they maintain relations. 
  Blue chip firms which had raised capital by organizing major 
international loan consortia during the latter half of the 
1980's have intensified moves toward reducing banks with which 
they do business to "core banking groups" of 10 or so 
institutions. A loan officer at a London branch of a Japanese 
bank says, "Only two or three Japanese banks will be left in 
core banking groups." As European firms intensify their 
aspirations to enter such markets as those of China, the appeal 
of phrases such as a "bank playing a dominant role in the Asian 
market" will serve as a powerful weapon to engage in 
transactions covering that area. 
  As an example, when a leading British telecommunications 
services company was issued approval for loans in March, fierce 
competition among Japanese banks resulted in the designation of 
Sumitomo and Sanwa Banks to handle the loans. Sanwa Bank was 
selected because it had already established close relations with 
the Hong Kong joint venture of the parent company. London branch 
manager and managing director Masaaki Fujimoto stresses that his 
bank's dominant role in Asia "serves as momentum for it to win 
business in that area." 
  Emphasis on Asia by Japanese banks' London branches is not 
limited to an appeal for customers. Connections with European 
firms entering the Asian market have been providing increasing 
opportunities to develop new business ideas for the Asian market. 
  Mitsubishi Bank played an intermediary role in arranging a 
$1.5 billion loan by a Japanese-U.S.-European loan consortium 
signed in the fall of 1993 for the construction of an oil 
refinery in Thailand by Royal Dutch Shell. The transaction was 
initiated by the London branch of Mitsubishi by taking advantage 
of its previous relationship with Shell. 
  Reportedly, "individuals in charge of project financing and 
aircraft financing are making frequent trips to Hong Kong and 
Singapore" from Sumitomo Bank's London branch. As growth in 
demand for capital remains sluggish in Europe, loan officers in 
London have turned their attention to Asia, where demand for 
capital is lively. 
  Needless to say, any increased activity by European branches 
in winning business for the Asian market can cause friction 
within banks. Thus, the respective banks have devised systems 
for sharing profits arising from such advisory activities among 
branches and for conducting business across the branches' 
regional jurisdictions. 
  Japanese banks' London branches eying Asia face formidable 
competition from European and U.S. banks. One assistant branch 
manager of a long-term credit bank's London branch admits, 
"Britain's Merchant Bank with experience under the old colonial 
system has far more know-how in the area of providing 
capital-raising advice." And, U.S. investment bankers are making 
bold investments in personnel and capital in the Asian market. 
  Japanese banks are working assiduously to establish their 
own 
unique strengths. Tadashi Kurachi, the Bank of Tokyo's managing 
director and London branch general manager for European affairs, 
stresses, "Our bank has a branch network that covers the world 
as far as India and Pakistan and has access to detailed 
information through the Chinese connection." Both Mitsubishi and 
Sumitomo say, "Not only are we strong in Asia, but we sell 
ourselves in terms of being superior in handling project 
financing and aircraft financing." 
  London branches of Japanese banks have finally recovered 
from 
losses suffered as a result of inflated real estate investments 
in the latter half of the 1980's and are now seeking a path to 
the future. "Asia" is now designated as an ideal target for that 
purpose. The future will provide the answer to whether they can 
compete effectively with European and U.S. banks and whether 
they can make effective use of their full potential.

  [Text] Fiscal year 1994 pension fund management plans of 
eight trust banks (including Daiwa Bank) have been released. 
Mitsui Trust &amp; Banking will lead all eight banks in 
increasing 
it percentage of investments in domestic stock in relative to 
total assets by 5 percentage points over holdings as of the end 
of fiscal year 1993. The reason is that banks feel the economy 
will improve during the fiscal year and that stock prices will 
rise moderately. No consistent pattern has been established in 
investments in domestic bonds and foreign currency-denominated 
assets. Operating profits of company pension funds are expected 
to remain sluggish in this fiscal year and the asset balances of 
the funds at the eight trust banks are expected to rise by 2 
trillion yen, to a level of about 30 trillion yen. 
  Mitsubishi Trust &amp; Banking, among trust banks, assumes 
the 
spreading viewpoint that "stock prices will enter a rising trend 
in the second half of the fiscal year." The majority of the 
trust banks expect a return of 10 percent on stock investments 
and will aggressively allocate any additional funds available 
during the fiscal year to investments in domestic stocks. Toyo 
Trust &amp; Banking will allocate funds primarily to issues with 
high growth potential and those that are relatively cheaply 
priced in its effort to increase the rate of return. 
  However, the prevailing view is that the rise in stock 
prices 
will be minimal. Many trust banks predict that the Nikkei stock 
average will rise to about 22,000-23,000 yen in the second half 
of the fiscal year, but that there will be a time when it breaks 
through the 20,000 yen level and return to the point where it 
was at the beginning of the year. As stated by Sumitomo Trust 
&amp; 
Banking, it appears that "we will have to watch our timing in 
purchasing additional stock as we monitor price movements." 
  In the area of investments in domestic bonds, trust banks 
are 
divided into two camps; i.e., those that take a cautious stance 
in expectation of rising interest rates and those that plan to 
purchase additional bonds as a source for long-term income. 
Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking plans to reduce its allocation of 
funds 
for investment in domestic bonds by 5 percent during the current 
fiscal year, based on the assessment that "interest rates will 
rise when the economic recovery becomes visible." 
  Since Mitsui Trust &amp; Banking's proportion of funds 
allocated 
for bond investments is low compared to other banks, it plans to 
add to its holdings in the current fiscal year. Nippon Trust 
Bank disposed of bond holdings between the end of 1993 and the 
beginning of this year on the premise that bond prices were 
hovering at a high level, leading to a lower proportion of 
domestic bond holdings, and now plans to raise investments in 
bonds during the fiscal year. 
  With respect to foreign currency-denominated assets, Yasuda 
Trust &amp; Banking says, "We will expand the number of nations 
in 
which we invest and aggressively pursue investments in foreign 
stocks." On the other hand, some banks, such as Sumitomo Trust 
&amp; 
Banking say, "We will maintain our current proportion of foreign 
assets, because it is difficult to predict the future of foreign 
exchange rates." 
  Company annuity funds represent the total of welfare annuity 
funds and tax qualifying annuity funds held in trust. Company 
annuity fund asset balances based on book value held by the 
eight trust banks as of the end of March 1994 were about 27.6 
trillion yen. The banks predict that asset balances will 
increase by 5-10 percent or by a total of 2 trillion yen during 
the year.

  [Text] The Advisory Committee for Energy (advisory body to 
the minister of international trade and industry) held a 
subcommittee meeting on demand and supply on 21 June to compile 
a long-term estimate on the demand and supply of energy up to 
the year 2010. 
  The estimate sees reliance on oil in 2010 to decline by 10.5 
percentage points to 47.7 percent. Annual rate of increase in 
demand will be held down to around 1 percent, 0.4 percent lower 
than the growth rate originally projected in 1990. The Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry [MITI] will implement its 
energy policy according to this estimate. 
  The long-term energy demand and supply estimate is compiled 
every two to four years to project future demand and supply. 
The present one is intended to be a numerical basis for 
implementing new policies, and will serve as a guideline for 
future government energy policy. 
  According to the projection, energy demand in 2010, 
converted 
into crude oil, will be 423 million kiloliters, representing an 
increase of 62 million kiloliters compared to the actual demand 
in FY 1992. While demand for industrial energy, or energy used 
in factories, will remain low, demand for energy from the 
nonindustrial sectors, such as households, and the 
transportation sector is expected to grow. 
  In terms of supply, reliance on oil and other mineral fuels 
will be reduced substantially to avert the greenhouse effect. 
Nuclear energy will be increased to become the number two 
primary energy source, while use of natural gas will also be 
expanded. The plan also calls for increasing new energy 
sources, such as solar energy and power generation using 
garbage, by 1.8 percent over that in 1992 to 3 percent of 
overall energy supply. As a result, it will be possible to hold 
down per capita emission of carbon dioxide in the year 2000 to 
the 1990 level. 
  Based on this estimate, the government plans to set targets 
for oil-substitute energy, which will be decided upon by a 
cabinet meeting in July. 
  MITI's Agency of Natural Resources and Energy is considering 
introducing the summer time system, as well as development of 
energy-saving technology, including electric cars and 
next-generation liquid crystal display equipment, to achieve 
these targets.

  [Text] The National Land Agency [NLA] will start studying 
"East Asia Energy-Information Highway Plan," designed to connect 
Japan with East Asia region by placing pipelines. Investing 
Japan's technological and financial power in the project, the 
NLA aims to complete the project, which will establish a new 
industrial and communications base in cooperation with other 
Asian nations, around the year 2020. The NLA has worked out the 
plan in line with the National Land Development Council's 
recommendation that "it is necessary to work out a national land 
development plan that covers the Asia-Pacific region." The NLA 
plans to put the finishing touches on the project at a meeting 
of a research panel which will be established in June, with aim 
of incorporating the project in the next national land 
development plan. 
  The project is to establish energy and power supply lines 
and 
optical-fiber information and communications lines by placing 
huge pipelines between Japan and the East Asian region, 
including Russia, South Korea, and China. According the plan, 
the pipelines, starting in Siberia, will run through to Japan 
via Sakhalin and will reach China via the Korean Peninsula. In 
addition to these pipelines, the NLA plans to place transport 
pipelines for raw materials. 
  With the establishment of pipelines, it will be easy for 
Japan to obtain resources from Asian nations, and its supply of 
energy and raw materials will also be stabilized. The project, 
which includes the placement of high-speed, mass-storage 
communications lines, will also help promote and improve the 
international exchange of information.

  [Text] The Petrochemical Industry Association (Chairman 
Hajime Murata) revealed on 16 June that Taiwan has levied an 
antidumping tariff on polypropylene (PP) resin made by Japan and 
South Korea. According to the association, a maximum 68.71 
percent tariff has been superimposed on the regular import 
tariff (2.5 percent) for Japanese products. It is the first time 
that Japanese resin has become the target of an antidumping 
tariff. 
  In the fall of 1992, a complaint was received from a 
Taiwanese PP manufacturer, Taiwan Polypropylene (Taipei), that 
it suffered a disadvantage because both Japanese and South 
Korean manufacturers imported PP at an unreasonably low price, 
and Taiwan authorities carried out an investigation starting in 
June 1993. While Japanese manufacturers submitted data, they 
counterargued in a public hearing that "they are importing 
product items that cannot be manufactured in Taiwan," but it was 
not accepted. 
  The subject of the tariff is the PP homopolymer type used 
mainly for sundries. An antidumping tariff of 5.16 to 68.71 
percent for each manufacturer has been imposed according to the 
difference between domestic shipment price in Japan and export 
price to Taiwan. The same tariffs will be applied even in cases 
where manufacturers who have not previously exported to Taiwan 
newly export. 
  The amount of raw material propylene production is slight in 
Taiwan, the amount of PP production is about 220,000 tons 
(1993), and they depend on imports for about the same amount 
(little over 190,000 tons, 1993). Exports from Japan were 45,000 
tons of this (1993). 
  Regarding the effect of the antidumping tariff, the 
Petrochemical Industry Association explains that, "since 
necessary items will probably be imported in the future also, it 
will not be zero. Since the export amount for each individual 
manufacturer is small, it will not be a problem."

  [Text] The import of ethylene, a basic petrochemical raw 
material, is rapidly increasing. The ethylene plants of various 
petrochemical companies have a surplus over about 20 percent, 
but it is due to manufacturers one after the other suspending 
plant operations with the objective of production adjustment and 
there conversely becoming a sense of product shortage. 
Previously, other companies in the industry accommodated each 
other on shortages, but a big deficit on synthetic resins has 
affected various companies and recently they have begun to be 
reluctant to accommodate at cheap prices, spurring an increase 
in imports. 
  Imports began to increase in April this year. According to 
trade statistics, the amount of imports for April was 11,500 
tons (no record of imports for the same month of the previous 
year). It was double that of March, and nearly half of the 
amount of 1993 imports (24,834 tons) was achieved within the one 
month of April. 
  The importer for the most part has been South Korea. All 
ethylene manufacturers such as Showa Denko, Mitsui 
Petrochemical, Maruzen Petrochemical, and Tonen Chemical, are 
buying. The price of South Korean ethylene is about 40 to 45 yen 
per kilo. 
  While some say that the reason for imports is that "There is 
a temporary shortage of ethylene due to suspending operations 
for regularly scheduled plant repairs" (Maruzen Petrochemical), 
there also are manufacturers who point out that, "Imports can be 
bought cheaper than buying domestic" (Showa Denko).

  [Text] According to performance such as major petrochemical 
product production in May announced on 16 June by the 
Petrochemical Industry Association (Chairman Hajime Murata), 
production of the four major resins such as polyethylene each 
increased compared to the same month of the previous year. The 
increase rate, starting with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) 
which was 8 percent, was 6 percent for both low-density 
polyethylene (LDPE) and polystyrene (PS), and 3 percent for 
polypropylene (PP). The four resins all have exceeded the same 
month of the previous year since November 1991. 
  Production increased "because previously sluggish domestic 
demand recovered" (Petrochemical Industry Association). Viewing 
domestic shipment amounts, LDPE and HDPE each were the same as 
the same month of the previous year; PP increased 2 percent and 
PS increased 1 percent. That for electrical machinery, VTR's 
[video tape recorders], and others slumped, but that for 
television and air conditioners increased. In addition, that for 
wrapping material and sundries also increased. 
  In exports, on the other hand, PS for Southeast Asia was 
favorable, but overall it leveled off, affected by the high yen. 
As a result, the total amount of shipments was at about the same 
level as the previous year for the four resins. Inventory is 
piling, up with regularly scheduled repairs to production 
facilities drawing close. 
  Production of ethylene, which is the basic raw material of 
petrochemicals, was 519,700 tons, an increase of 6 percent 
compared to the same month of the previous year.

<F P=106> [James Cotton Commentary: "Cold War Gains New Lease of Life"] </F>
  [Text] The United States, Japan and South Korea are now in 
agreement that the time has come to impose sanctions upon North 
Korea because of its failure to implement international 
inspections of its nuclear program. Yet few have asked what 
such sanctions would achieve, it being assumed that sooner or 
later North Korea would have to admit to its nuclear ambitions. 
  But if such an admission is not forthcoming, and if neither 
Russia nor China cooperate fully with Washington's policy, the 
US will have little real leverage, and North Korea will have 
succeeded in undermining the post-Cold War principle of the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
  The assumption behind much of the manoeuvring over the 
Korean 
crisis has been that in the right circumstances North Korea 
would assent to international inspections which would establish 
the true character of the country's nuclear program. 
  In the past year, following the breakdown in inspection 
which 
occurred in early 1993, it has further been assumed that such 
inspections would expose this program as having the purpose of 
producing nuclear weapons. 
  This fact being demonstrated to the international community, 
pressures and inducements would then be used to motivate North 
Korea to abandon this weapons program. Tensions in the 
peninsula would ease, the Washington-Seoul alliance would be 
vindicated, and the principle of the unacceptability of nuclear 
weapons proliferation would be established. 
  These assumptions have never been valid, and have now been 
exposed as flawed. There is little chance that North Korea 
would take any steps which would make available incontrovertible 
evidence that the country has a nuclear weapons program. All 
through this crisis, North Korean spokesmen have asserted that 
such a program does not exist. 
  North Korea has rejected the final appeal to make available 
its nuclear records, so the issue will again be debated by the 
United Nations Security Council. If a resolution is proposed 
which would impose sanctions against the regime, what policy 
will North Korea follow? 
  The most likely step North Korea would take would be to 
leave 
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] regime. For more 
than a year, the country has been on its own reckoning but not 
according to the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] in a 
position of "suspended withdrawal" with regard to the treaty. 
  Such a step is the sovereign right of all signatories of the 
NPT, though withdrawal must be according to a set procedure 
which includes a three-month period of notice. 
  Once outside the NPT, North Korea would undoubtedly suffer 
further recriminations and isolation. But UN action to levy 
sanctions or take other measures would only be legitimised if 
the country could be declared a common security danger to the 
general peace and safety of the world. 
  Is it credible to regard North Korea as such a danger? The 
claim that the country is a general threat by virtue of its 
development of nuclear weapons is a weak one. There are a 
number of states outside the NPT, including Pakistan, Israel and 
India, that have nuclear weapons programs more sophisticated 
than that possessed by North Korea. 
  North Korea has not been engaged in a war since 1953, and 
although its international behaviour leaves something to be 
desired, its recent record is no worse than (for example) Syria 
which is presently courted by Washington as an associate in the 
Middle East peace process. 
  With these considerations in mind, it is unlikely that China 
would cooperate in levying sanctions. Without active Chinese 
support sanctions would not work, as more than half of North 
Korea's trade is with China. 
  And it is always possible that China would act positively to 
veto any UN Security Council resolution on this issue. 
  Meanwhile, the Russian proposal to convene an international 
conference on the issue, rather than adopt sanctions, has 
complicated matters further. Ever since President Yeltsin's 
visit to Seoul in 1992 the Russian influence in North Korea has 
been very much reduced. Now, smarting from domestic criticism 
from the right to the effect that Moscow's foreign policy has 
been made in Washington, Russia seeks to revive a role in a 
region long of strategic concern. 
  This leaves the US in a difficult position. South Korea and 
Japan are prepared to act in concert with the US to pressure 
Pyongyang. Without cooperation from Beijing and Moscow, 
however, it is not clear what pressure will achieve beyond 
including further perceptions of isolation and embattlement in 
North Korea. 
  American actions have contributed to these difficulties. 
  Initially, it was said that North Korea had to surrender its 
nuclear capability, and unless it did so the military option 
would be considered. 
  Then the US Secretary of State lectured the Chinese 
Government on its human rights failures. And Pakistan was 
offered a nuclear deal whereby provided no further fissile 
material was produced and the capping of its nuclear program was 
internationally verified, the country would be allowed to 
acquire further US weaponry. 
  The first initiative undermined efforts to co-operate with 
China on the North Korea issue. The second must have signalled 
to Pyongyang that the US was prepared to refrain from too close 
a scrutiny of the past activities of nuclear proliferators 
provided that their behaviour improved in the future. 
  But by arguing that the International Atomic Energy Agency 
have free access to the nuclear fuel elements currently being 
replaced in the reactor at Yongbyon, the US is insisting that 
all of the past history of North Korea's program should be 
exposed. 
  Just at the time that it is possible to speak of the 
post-Cold War era in Europe, the Cold War alliance structure in 
North-East Asia has been given a new lease of life.

<F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>
  [Text] Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating is on his 
way to Jakarta this afternoon with his eyes firmly set on what 
he calls one of Australia's most important international 
relationships. The focus on the interests the two countries 
share in the Asia-Pacific means that the Indonesian media 
crackdown is well down on the Keating agenda. Mr. Keating is 
under pressure from some Australian lobby groups to take 
Indonesia to task after Jakarta last week closed the country's 
three leading weekly news magazines -- TEMPO, EDITOR, and DETIK. 
But the prime minister says he'll be using his informal talk 
with President Suharto tomorrow to discuss the APEC [Asia 
Pacific Economic Cooperation] Asia-Pacific leaders' summit in 
Jakarta in November. Mr. Keating told Graeme Dobell that the 
Suharto government's closure of its three leading news magazines 
was a backward step during a period of rapid change: 
  [Begin recording] [Keating] Indonesia is like many countries 
in the region; it's in a state of constant change where there 
are many imperatives starting to impact on the country: the 
growth imperative and all that brings with it for change, and 
diversity and plurality of opinion. I don't doubt that these 
are pressures which haven't been as evident in bygone days as 
they are now. For our part, Gareth Evans as foreign minister 
has made clear Australia's disappointment about the fact that 
these [word indistinct] have been changed. But again, from our 
point of view, I mean there are the same, similar things -- 
there is press control in China and we're still doing trade with 
China, there is a fairly tight control of the press in Malaysia 
and we are still doing trade with Malaysia. I think, you know, 
this relationship now has many links to it and it does give us 
the opportunity, I think, to, you know, maintain a working 
relationship despite some of these things which are 
disappointments to us. 
  [Dobell] Does it symbolize [words indistinct] to put on the 
brakes? Is it a step back from the policy of openness that 
President Suharto has been talking about? 
  [Keating] Well, I think it may be that we will witness in 
many countries similar to Indonesia -- such as Indonesia, 
similar to Indonesia -- that there'll be, you know, (?full) four 
steps forward and one back and four forward and one back and 
then I think we'll see a bit of this. But, there's also strong 
public opinion -- reactions -- about this, where there is any 
crimp on information, wherever it occurs in most places, and I 
understand this to be the case in Indonesia as well. 
  [Dobell] One of the comments from Jakarta has been from the 
head of Indonesia's largest Muslim organization, Abdulraham 
Wahid, who said that he thought you, as a friend, should speak 
to the president on this. Do you have a duty perhaps as a 
friend to speak to Suharto on this? 
  [Keating] Australia is not the international news and media 
plurality policeman. Now, there is a sort of view around that 
because we have a very free press we ought to be arguing for a 
press similar to ours wherever we go. Well, we are an open and 
plural country and that's part of our strength, and we're also 
very forthright. But, you know, I mean I could make my next 
visit to China. The first item on the agenda I'll put press 
freedom and plurality. We [words indistinct] first agenda item 
no one should choose. [End recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "PNG's Drift Towards Disaster"] </F>
  [Text] More and more, Papua New Guinea seems to be 
drifting towards disaster. 
  The Wingti Government's expansionist budget strategy, based 
on the expectation of an oil and mining boom, has left the 
country with almost no foreign reserves. 
  The mini-Budget, brought down in March by the new Finance 
Minister, Mr Masket Iangalio was supposed to start bringing the 
Government's finances back under control by cutting the 1994 
deficit from 7 per cent to just under 5 per cent of GDP. It 
accepted the reality of depressed oil prices, cutting spending 
and increasing taxes. 
  However, like last November's Budget, the mini-Budge was 
based on absurdly optimistic estimates of the cost of the war in 
Bougainville. Mr Iangalio's spending cuts have been almost 
completely offset by additional, unplanned spending in the 
province. 
  Economists are now expecting a budget deficit of between 5 
and 6 per cent of GDP. It will be the third year in a row that 
the deficit has exceeded 5 per cent of GDP. 
  Rising oil and mineral prices should come to PNG's aid over 
the next few years. However, the PNG Government seems 
determined to do all in its power to deter new mining investment. 
  The Minister for Mining and Petroleum, Mr John Kaputin, has 
just announced a moratorium on new mining projects while he 
sorts out a new mining policy. 
  This follows a series of damaging controversies in which the 
Government has acquired a 15 per cent equity in the Porgera 
mine, delayed the Lihir project by making contradictory 
agreements on ownership, and changed the mining laws to deprive 
CRA [expansion not known] of its Mt Kare tenement. At the same 
time, BHP [Broken Hill Proprietary] has been the subject of a $4 
billion suit over pollution from its Ok Tedi mine. 
  Mr Iangalio immediately contradicted Mr Kaputin's 
announcement of the moratorium. However, that just seems to 
confirm that the administration of PNG's mining policy will 
continue to be erratically driven by short-term political 
considerations. 
  And these problems overlay the long-standing structure 
problems of the PNG economy: urban wages that are five to six 
times higher than the country can afford; an oversized public 
sector; an overvalued exchange rate; a largely-neglected 
agricultural sector; and one of the lowest levels of spending on 
infrastructure in the Third World. 
  Despite the country's extraordinary mineral wealth and 
generous aid from Australia, the quality of life of the great 
majority of Papua New Guineans who live in the countryside is 
below that of comparable developing countries. Education 
standards are very low, with adult literacy and school 
participation rates below comparable developing countries. 
Health services are also inadequate in the country areas. 
Infant and maternal-mortality rates art very high. Life 
expectancy is five years below the average for middle-income 
countries. 
  The result has been the large-scale migration of people to 
the towns and a breakdown in law and order. 
  In an effort to keep people on the land, the Government has 
introduced price support schemes for the major export crops -- 
coffee, cocoa, palm oil, and copra. These schemes, which made 
an important contribution to the blow-out of spending last year, 
are highly inefficient because they encourage production of 
crops when farmers should be cutting back. They also put the 
Budget at considerable risk. 
  The question is what will it take to persuade PNG's leaders 
to adopt more responsible economic policies. 
  One option is to leave the country to the tender mercies of 
the IMF. However, there's no guarantee that PNG's leaders would 
learn from the experience. 
  What is certain, however, is that Australia will always be 
under international pressure to bail out PNG. It will be seen 
by everyone as our special responsibility. 
  Perhaps Australia can do more to avert disaster now. Its aid 
to PNG is largely determined by treaty, although it may still 
have some leverage. 
  Australia is switching from general budget assistance to 
program aid, which gives Canberra more say in the way the money 
is spent. This year, just over a quarter of our aid to PNG will 
be program aid. By 1996-97, the proportion of program aid will 
be up to 52 per cent. 
  What happens after that is a matter for negotiation although 
the broad agreement is that all aid will be program aid by about 
the end of the decade. Australia can be more or less generous, 
depending on the behaviour of the PNG Government. 
  While that may not seem to offer much leverage over Port 
Moresby's notoriously myopic politicians, it gives Australian 
ministers an opportunity to comment on the state of PNG economic 
management and potentially influence the bureaucracy, public 
opinion and the markets. It may strengthen the hand of those in 
the PNG Cabinet, like Mr Iangalio, who are trying to achieve 
reform. 
  We will get no thanks for the intervention, but we might 
save 
Papua New Guinea from a period of self-inflicted misery.

  [Text] President Suharto and Australian Prime Minister 
Paul Keating held two-hour private talks on bilateral ties and 
APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation] at Jakarta's Merdeka 
Palace this morning. Minister-State Secreatary Murdiono briefed 
reporters on the details of the meeting: 
  [Begin Murdiono recording] During the talks, the two leaders 
exchanged views on various issues, including bilateral, 
regional, and international events, as well as events related to 
APEC after the grouping's meeting in Seattle last year. Several 
points I can tell you are that the two leaders share the view 
that ties between Indonesia and Australia have progressed 
smoothly, while mutual understanding has also been enhanced 
since the two leaders met some time ago. We all know that Prime 
Minister Keating visited Indonesia a few months ago. 
  The two leaders also noted that bilateral trade ties have 
steadily increased and that there are more frequent exchanges of 
visits between the two countries' officials, both at the 
national and regional level. The president pointed out that in 
some Australian states, the Indonesian language has become the 
second language taught in schools. The two leaders also believe 
that relations between businessmen and private citizens should 
be further intensified because, geographically speaking, the two 
countries are indeed close neighbors which share similar views 
and objectives for the future, namely boosting cooperation for 
the progress of both countries. 
  The two leaders also discussed matters relating to APEC, as 
well as the APEC leaders' meeting on Blake Island. They noted 
that follow-up actions have been taken and these will be useful 
for preparations to hold the second APEC summit meeting 
scheduled in Indonesia in November. The Australian prime 
minister also expressed his desire to extend his assistance to 
make the upcoming APEC meeting successful. That is all I can 
tell you; thank you for your attention. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] On the Korean summit, you're 
familiar with the developments? The two heads of state 
concerned, the president of the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea and the Republic of Korea -- President Kim Il-song and 
President Kim Yong-sam, respectively -- have agreed to meet in 
Pyongyang late July after some preliminary conferences by 
subordinate officials. And I would like to see this as opening 
up a new era of regional stability in the Asia-Pacific region. 
I therefore convey our admiration for the two Korean leaders 
for showing statesmanship in pursuing the path of peace rather 
than the path of belligerent confrontation. You will recall that 
this has been our consistent policy at the height of the nuclear 
confrontation in the Korean peninsula, and even before. 
  Questions so far? 
  I also would like to inform everyone that I am satisfied 
with 
the conclusion of the first round of negotiations between the 
Philippines and Indonesia on the delimiting, or the

point out that this opens up some opportunities for us to have, 
perhaps, a fishing agreement and thereby eliminate previous 
difficulties and confrontations which have taken place in the 
absence of such agreements. [passage omitted]

member of the Australian Parliament consultative delegation that 
will soon visit Vietnam, in which it was said that the main 
purpose of the visit would be to examine the human rights issue. 
  Vietnam agreed to receive the Australian Parliament 
consultative delegation in the name of developing bilateral 
relations between the two countries on the basis of equality, 
respect for each other's sovereignty, and mutually beneficial 
cooperation. The purpose of the visit is to exchange views on 
issues of mutual concern, particularly measures to promote 
cooperation. Following several meetings, both sides clearly 
understood this. Any activities that are not in line with this 
agreement or that intervene in Vietnam's internal affairs would 
be inappropriate. They could undermine the visit and harm the 
cooperative relations between the two countries, which have been 
developing favorably.

<F P=106> [Article by Kazunori Ishiguro in the Point of Argument </F>
column: "Time To Review `Special Consideration Given to U.S.'"] 
  [Text] It is necessary to consider future Japan-U.S. trade 
friction in terms of the period beginning around the time of the 
"breakdown" of the Japan-U.S. summit meeting in February. 
  The problem is a U.S. trade policy that insists on 
establishing numerical targets (or results-oriented policy). 
  Through the Japan-U.S. Semiconductor Agreement, the United 
States strongly pressed Japan to increase its share of 
foreign-made (in actuality, American-made) semiconductors to 20 
percent, and somehow that target was achieved. 
  As a result, the United States has sought to apply this 
approach to all areas. Japan strongly opposed this, resulting in 
the "breakdown" of the summit talks. 
  After Japan said "no," it was perplexed about how to 
proceed. 
Perhaps this was because it was not used to saying no. In any 
event, a kind of "scapegoat hunt" began. 
  From the United States came the view that the bureaucrats 
were to blame, and in Japan there was a related trend. 
  While this was going on, Japan-U.S. friction over cellular 
phones, which had been smoldering since last summer, suddenly 
flared up. The United States began brandishing the U.S. Omnibus 
Trade Law's Super 301 clause (the so-called telecommunications 
clause). And in the end, on 12 March, like Pavlov's dog, Japan 
swallowed U.S. demands, bringing a "resolution" to the problem. 
  In this course of events, however, there are some important 
matters that are being half forgotten. First, Japanese 
bureaucrats are not the only ones who have been strongly opposed 
to a trade policy based on numerical targets. Last September, a 
group of Japanese and American economists, centered around an 
American, Professor Bagwati of Columbia University, issued to 
Japanese and U.S. leaders a letter strongly opposing a policy of 
managed trade. Then, this January, there was a declaration to 
the same effect from a subcommittee, to which I belong, of the 
Industrial Structure Council, the body that issues the "Unfair 
Trade Report." And subsequently, a similar declaration was 
issued by a group of Japanese economists, legal scholars and 
others. 
  It was in this context that the "breakdown" of the summit 
talks occurred. To the extent that the United States insisted on 
a trade policy based on numerical targets, the "breakdown" was a 
natural outcome and unavoidable. For Japan to have pliantly 
compromised would clearly have been contrary to the spirit of 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which is the 
same as the free trade philosophy of the World Trade 
Organization (WTO). 
  Here it is necessary to thoroughly consider the meaning of 
the "resolution" to the cellular phone friction. This friction 
arose directly from the contention that the investment plan of 
IDO, a private Japanese company, was inadequate for popularizing 
the Motorola type of cellular phone in Japan. In the evolution 
of this friction, Japan and the United States had signed an 
agreement in 1989 whose main purpose was to allocate additional 
frequencies for the sake of the Motorola-type phone (different 
from the existing NTT type). The United States now claimed that 
this agreement had been violated. 
  No matter how much you read this document, however, you'll 
find nothing written in it other than that the above-mentioned 
allocation of new frequencies must be based on: transparency, 
national treatment, equal market access (comparable market 
access), and non-discriminatory principles. 
  Based on the words "equal market access," the United States 
contended that, if the same market share as held by the NTT type 
of phone was not immediately secured for the Motorola type, it 
would be a violation of the 1989 agreement--a contention that 
was clearly unreasonable. 
  The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (the ministry 
that bore the brunt of the friction), through consultation with 
the other related ministries, solidified its policy of 
immediately bringing a case before GATT should the United States 
enact sanctions against Japan through Super 301. Fully employing 
the mass media, it also sought to remove the U.S. 
misunderstanding. "Please read the agreement calmly," it 
requested, in what was in actuality almost a scream of grief. 
  On 12 March, however, the two countries signed the 
document--the "resolution" of this friction. It states that the 
Japanese Government will take all possible measures to realize 
the quite unreasonable investment plan that IDO ultimately 
swallowed. Also, the Japanese Government acknowledged that this 
series of disputes was "related to" implementing the 1989 
agreement. That the agreement could not lead to such a 
conclusion, however, was the foundation on which everything had 
been predicated. 
  Thus, in the end, Japan not only swallowed U.S. demands for 
a 
trade policy based on numerical targets, but also made a strange 
promise again. Using this as "unshakable proof," the United 
States, at the resumption of the economic framework talks, may 
again try to force Japan to swallow a policy of "numerical 
targets." Should that happen, how will the new administration 
respond? It is high time to calmly consider how far the momentum 
of the irrational "special consideration given to the United 
States" can be allowed to go. 
  I strongly hope that zJapan will again take a stance firmly 
based on GATT principles. "The world" is now demanding more than 
ever that Japan take such a resolute stance. With that in mind, 
the significance of the 1994 "Unfair Trade Report," which will 
soon be released, should be recognized anew.

<F P=106> [Article by a "Japan-U.S. relations reporting team"; sixth </F>
in a series entitled "Japan and the United States -- the Picture 
Shakes": "Let's Get Them `To Compensate for Cold War' Efforts"] 
  Huge Current-Account Deficits 
  Over the period from late April to early May, there was 
turbulence in the money market with the United States' long-term 
interest rates rising sharply while the dollar fell. The United 
States moved fast, and a brake was put on the fall of the dollar 
by cooperating with Japan and Europe in making market 
intervention. The rise in the long-term interest rates stopped 
as well somehow, but it is said that all the senior officials of 
the U.S. Government, known as the "MIT (Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology) school," were pale during that period. 
  The MIT school means a group of people like Laura Tyson, 
chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) under the 
Office of President, and Blinder [name as published], former CEA 
member, who received their doctor of philosophy degrees from 
MIT, and Under Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summer, who 
earned his bachelor of arts degree at the same school. They are 
the people who think importantly of balancing market principles 
and government policies. For them, this was an opportunity to 
be reminded that the public uneasiness about the current-account 
deficits at the root of the market turbulence remains." 
  In the real economy of the United States, business 
performance is recovering, and the economy is back on the track 
of growing at a rate of more than 3 percent a year. To have 
this good trend continue for a long time, stability of interest 
rates is essential. But if the country wants to stabilize its 
interest rates, it has no other choice but to return to the 
basic question of "reducing the current-account deficits." 
<H5>  Passing Over Economic Burdens </H5>
  For instance, if we take a look at the contents of the 
current- account deficits, we can see that the reduction of 
government deficits, which is a major element, is not making 
progress as expected. Even in the area of family finances, the 
savings rate went down to a post-war low of 4.0 percent in 1993, 
and the condition of excessive consumption has not been 
remedied. There has been no improvement in the structural 
problem of upward economy meaning increased imports and thus 
increased current-account deficits. As a result, the policy 
line of "maintaining low-interest rates and achieving a high 
economic growth rate" is not functioning properly. The market 
has come to recognize these ills of the U.S. economy, and this 
was precisely the reason for the gloom of the MIT school people. 
  How seriously does the Clinton administration regard these 
ills? There is good material that is said to be "useful in 
making judgment on that question." It is testimony U.S. Trade 
Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor gave before the Senate 
Finance Committee shortly after his nomination as USTR was 
approved by Congress in January 1993. He said in that testimony: 
  -- In the post-war world, the top priority task for Western 
countries, including the United States, was to win the Cold War 
over the Eastern camp, which had the Soviet Union as its pillar. 
To do that, it was necessary to win not only in armaments, but 
also in the economic race. 
  -- To win an economic victory, the United States formed new 
international frameworks like the IMF and the GATT, and has 
opened up its market to other countries, thus helping Japan and 
Europe to reconstruct their countries. 
  -- But the U.S. economy started to stagnate clearly as the 
Vietnam war bogged down and the oil crisis hit it in the early 
1970s. The trade deficit started to grow steadily. In spite of 
the situation, the East-West Cold War at the time did not allow 
the United States to retreat toward giving priority to the 
economy. 
  -- What should have happened was for the United States to 
switch its policy toward giving priority to the economy in the 
Reagan era of the 1980s. But President Reagan chose the line of 
expanding arms instead, thus expanding the government deficits 
very rapidly. 
  -- Victory has been won in the Cold War by paying an 
enormous 
cost, but the U.S. economy has become a shambles. It has become 
no longer possible for the United States to serve as the world 
leader without any conditions. Unless the United States regains 
its economy and re-establishes its "economic security," it will 
not be able to guaratee the political and diplomatic safety of 
the world. 
  Pressure To `Pay Up' 
  This testimony shows that the United States has analyzed the 
causes for the current-account deficit problem, not from the 
perspective of the current market turbulence, but by looking 
back on the long span of time since World War II ended. 
Besides, as far as Japan and Europe are concerned, aside from 
the question of whether such a U.S. stand is correct or not, the 
testimony seems to be saying to them: "You should pay for the 
losses the United States had to suffer to secure security for 
the world." 
  Of course, the fragile U.S. economy is no small matter for 
Japan even when viewed from a short-term perspective. That is 
because its impact on the money market can be more sensitive 
than its real economy. The flip side of the coin of having a 
cheap dollar is the high yen, and the rise in the U.S. long-term 
interest rates puts upward pressure on the interest rates of 
Japan. An investment consulting executive officer of a major 
securities firm said, "If U.S. long-term interests rates go up 
to the 8 percent level, Japan's stock prices will collapse." 
  But such a short-term view is not enough to understand or 
explain all the intentions or agonies of the United States. If 
the United States has come up with its present policies on the 
basis of the roles it has played in the post-war period and on 
the fact that the Cold War has now ended, then it may be 
necessary for Japan to look at the thinking of "pay up," which 
lies behind it all.

<F P=106> [Tony Walker Commentary: "N. Korea Repeats Its Case To Our </F>
Man in Beijing"] 
  [Text] Australia's Ambassador in Beijing, Mr Michael 
Lightowler, received an unusual visitor last week in the person 
of North Korea's senior representative in the Chinese capital. 
  At the end of a lengthy restatement of North Korea's 
position 
on nuclear inspections -- that it opposes the International 
Atomic Energy Agency's "unreasonable" demands for access to its 
nuclear facilities -- Australian officials were none the wiser 
about the purpose of the visit. 
  They discerned nothing new in the official's remarks. No 
requests were made for Australia, the current IAEA 
[International Atomic Energy Agency] chair, to use its good 
offices on North Korea's behalf. 
  There was certainly no hint of a change in Pyongyang's tack, 
which threatens the worst international crisis since Saddam 
Husayn sent his legions into Kuwait in August 1990. 
  While that crisis risked the West's economic well-being and 
raised the ugly spectre of Iraqi domination of oil-rich Gulf 
States, the latest threat to international order is hardly less 
grave, and solutions are certainly more complex. 
  At this stage, prospects appear slim of an international 
consensus emerging in favour of all-encompassing sanctions such 
as those applied against Iraq. Agreement on limited economic 
penalties will also test American diplomacy. 
  China last week indicated that it was reluctant to support 
sanctions when a Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Beijing 
"did not favour the resort to means that might sharpen the 
confrontation". 
  However, in the past few days there has been a slightly 
sterner tone in China's public references to the crisis. 
  XINHUA, the official Chinese newsagency, reported that the 
IAEA was "running into obstacles" in determining whether 
weapons-grade material had been diverted. Previously, Chinese 
media had refrained from using words that might in any way be 
construed as perjorative by Pyongyang. But none of this can be 
interpreted as an indication that China is about to change tack. 
  Russia, too, is wavering. President Yeltsin told South 
Korea's President Kim last week that Moscow would not support 
sanctions until a Russian-proposed international conference on 
the issue was held. This would seem a recipe for prevarication. 
  Meantime, suspicions continue to harden into near certainty 
that North Korea has on two occasions (the first was in 1989) 
diverted weapons-grade plutonium for bomb-making. Western 
intelligence believes it built one and possibly two nuclear 
devices after the first diversion. 
  The latest would give it the capability to add up to half a 
dozen bombs to its existing arsenal, according to Western 
estimates. But numbers are hardly the most relevant issue. 
  With even one nuclear device and, just as important, the 
means to deliver it, Pyongyang is in a position to terrorise 
South Korea and blackmail other States in the region. 
  Without doubt, this is potentially, if not actually, the 
gravest foreign policy crisis of the Clinton presidency, and one 
for which, judging by Mr Clinton's performance as far as Haiti 
and the former Yugoslavia are concerned, he is ill-equipped. 
  The stakes could not be higher. Failure to curb North 
Korea's nuclear ambitions: 
  -- Risks the collapse of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty (NPT) which is due for renewal next year. 
  -- Threatens to destabilise further the already 
combustible Korean peninsula. 
  -- Risks setting off a nuclear arms race in north Asia 
with Japan, South Korea and Taiwan bidding for their own nuclear 
capabilities. 
  -- Raises the alarming prospect of Pyongyang exporting its 
nuclear know-how to mid-eastern States, including Iran, Syria 
and Libya. 
  So what should the international community do in the face of 
North Korean defiance? 
  The US, with the support of both the South Koreans and the 
Japanese, is moving towards proposing limited sanctions that 
would further isolate Pyongyang economically. But for sanctions 
to bite hard, China's agreement would be needed to shut off oil 
supplies for both North Korea's domestic use and, more 
importantly, for its military machine. 
  Similarly, without the cooperation of China and Russia, a 
sea 
and air blockade of North Korea, as proposed by some, is not 
feasible. 
  The danger for the Americans, and for Mr Clinton in 
particular, is that lack of international consensus will leave 
the Administration again looking ineffectual in the face of a 
rogue regime's defiance. 
  The unpalatable prospect for the West is that in the end it 
might be obliged to swallow the fact that North Korea has become 
the latest nuclear power and hope that Pyongyang, having 
achieved that position, would agree to "capping" arrangements to 
contain further development of its nuclear arsenal. 
  North Korea might, so thinking goes, endorse such a deal in 
return for Western undertakings to relieve its economic and 
diplomatic isolation. "Rewarding" North Korea for its 
recalcitrance would be a bitter solution. But, equally, the 
alternatives are extremely unappealing, such as the ultimate 
sanction -- war.

  [Text] Washington, June 29 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- The United 
States looks favourably at the prospect of forging a new defence 
partnership with Malaysia based on access to sophisticated 
technology, technology transfer, exchange of information and 
joint military exercises rather than maintaining its physical 
presence in the region. 
  Malaysian Defence Minister Najib Tun Abdul Razak said here 
Tuesday after a meeting with his U.S. counterpart, Defence 
Secretary William Perry, that he believed of a very good scope 
for U.S.-Malaysia defence relationship and expected it to grow 
stronger in the years to come based on the new realities of the 
region, particularly in Southeast Asia. 
  ...A stronger Malaysia and a stronger ASEAN means that we'll 
be in a better position to guarantee the security of not only 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries but the 
region as a whole. 
  As far as the Asia-Pacific region is concerned, America is 
still looking towards maintaining a strong presence in Japan and 
Korea. But as far as our region is concerned they're happy with 
the present arrangement...bearing in mind the U.S. budgetary 
constraints, he said on wrapping up his nine-day visit to the 
U.S. which has taken him to New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis 
and Washington. 
  Earlier, Najib was given a ceremonial welcome by American 
military service men at the Pentagon with a 19-gun salute, and a 
moving rendition of the Malaysian national anthem Negara Ku [My 
country] as well as the U.S' national anthem, The Star Spangled 
Banner by a U.S. army band.

  [Text] Dear Listeners: Ko Soe Win Nyo of the Democratic 
Voice of Burma's Manerplaw branch has dispatched a report on the 
assassination of Colonel Tun Yee, vice chairman and commander in 
chief of the Pa-o National Organization [PNO], which had 
previously reached a cease-fire agreement with the SLORC [State 
Law and Order Restoration Council]. 
  It has been learned that Colonel Tun Yee, vice chairman and 
commander in chief of the PNO, which reached a cease-fire 
agreement with the SLORC in December 1993, was assassinated by 
one of his followers. 
  The PNO is led by U Aung Kham Ti, and since the cease-fire 
SLORC has been gradually controlling and manipulating the group, 
said several members. SLORC has been seriously working to 
transform the PNO into a defense unit and to keep it under SLORC 
control. Col. Tun Yee, vice chairman and commander in chief, 
did not accept this idea. SLORC has ridded the obstacle, Col. 
Tun Yee, from its path and camouflaged the incident by saying he 
was killed because of an internal disagreement. It has been 
learned that he was assassinated at the Aung Su Pan Camp, one of 
the PNO's camps with 15 villages along Hopong-Loikaw Road. 
  Concerning this matter, SLORC said Col. Tun Yee was killed 
because of a business conflict among PNO members. Whatever 
SLORC says, PNO members certainly believe that their leader was 
killed by the ruling junta and there is a growing 
dissatisfaction against the SLORC within PNO units.

  [Text] According to a report, on the evening of 27 June 
600 Red Wa soldiers, armed by a Burmese Government force in 
Tachilek, attacked the (Pakae) camp which is located on (Pakae) 
hill about two km from (Huanam Mae Kham) village in Burma and 
about three km from Ban Thoetthai, Tambon Thoetthai, Mae Fa 
Luang Subdistrict, Thailand's Chiang Rai Province. The attack 
resulted in 20 Red Wa soldiers being killed and 32 wounded, 
while the Khun Sa force suffered 20 killed and seven wounded. 
The Khun Sa force, however, successfully defended its base 
after thirty minutes of fighting and seized several weapons from 
the attackers. 
  The clash was the first such incident after the signing of 
the peace accord in May by independent ethnic minority forces 
which oppose the Burmese Government. The Khun Sa force, 
however, does not have such an accord with the Burmese 
Government. The other ethnic minority groups hope that the Red 
Wa will keep its pledge to them. 
  On the same evening, a ceremony was held in Tachilek to 
welcome new recruits who will join seven battalions of the 55th 
Division under Major General Swu Tun, commander of the Eastern 
Military Command, which came from Rangoon and Toungoo. The new 
augmented force is likely to participate in renewed fighting in 
the area.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 30 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Japan's new 
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama will have to deal with the 
issue of market access which is a persistent problem to many of 
the country's trading partners, including Malaysia, Deputy Prime 
Minister Anwar Ibrahim, said here Thursday. 
  Japan's obvious lack of market access to exports from other 
countries coupled with the steep appreciation of the yen has led 
Malaysia, along with most of Japan's trading partners to incur 
deficits in their bilateral trade. 
  However, in the meantime, the deputy prime minister said, 
Malaysian exporters should strive to be more competitive in 
penetrating new markets while importers should look to other 
sources of supply for their inputs. 
  This would reduce the adverse effects on the yen which has 
appreciated markedly against the ringgit, Anwar said when 
responding to queries by newsmen as to what Malaysia was doing 
to address the trade deficit with Japan. 
  In January-February this year, Malaysia suffered a 
significant deficit in its trade with Japan of [Malaysian 
ringgit] RM3 billion (about US $1.2 billion), having imported 
RM5.6 billion (about US $2.24 billion) worth of goods and 
exported RM2.7 billion, (about US$1.08 billion) with the major 
imports being machinery. 
  The deficit has been further compounded by the escalation of 
the yen, by as much as 20 percent over the past two years. 
Currently, the ringgit's exchange rate is hovering at 2.6288 
from 2.0020/50 on June 30, 1992.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 29 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Libya 
welcomes any effort by any country or grouping, like the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), to arrange 
negotiations aimed at getting the United Nations Security 
Council to lift sanctions against the country. 
  The secretary for foreign affairs in the Libyan General 
People's Congress, Saad Mustafa Mujbar [name and title as 
received], said Wednesday his country commended Malaysia for 
reserving its stand on imposing wide sanctions against Libya. 
  The sanctions were imposed in April 1992 following Libya's 
refusal to hand over two of its citizens for trial in the United 
States in connection with the 1988 bombing of Pan America Flight 
103 over Lockerbie in Scotland in which 270 people were killed. 
  Mujbar, who leaves for home today after a four-day visit, 
told a press conference that Libya was ready to co-operate with 
the international community to reach the truth, but not to the 
extent of violating its laws and constitution. 
  A proposal by Scotland to have the two suspects tried in 
Scotland was rejected by the United States, Britain and France.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Fri. [24 June] -- DAP [Democratic 
Action Party] secretary-general Lim Kit Siang today urged the 
Cabinet to review the Home Ministry's ban on the Tamil biweekly 
newspaper THOOTHAN, following its publication of reports 
extremely embarrassing to MIC [Malaysian Indian Congress] 
president Datuk Sri S. Samy Vellu. 
  In its latest issue dated June 22, which could not hit the 
news-stands because of the June 21 ban, THOOTHAN reported that 
about 50 taxi permits meant for the Indian community had been 
"diverted" to a company. 
  In the last three months, THOOTHAN had published exclusive 
interviews with former Samy Vellu confidant and MIC public 
relations committee chairman V. Subramaniam Barat Maniam, who 
had confessed to being the main "co-ordinator" in the Maika 
Telekom shares issue. 
  Lim, in a statement, said the banning of THOOTHAN for 
exposing political and financial scandals would make a mockery 
of the fight against money politics. 
  "Apart from raising the fundamental issue of Press freedom, 
democracy and human rights, it also raises the question as to 
whether the Government is serious about fighting corruption in 
all forms."

  [Text] The Ministry of Tourism is in the process of holding 
discussions with an Australian consultancy for the 
implementation of the proposed U.S. $500 million comprehensive 
casino and international airport project at Sihanoukville. 
  Speaking to THE CAMBODIA TIMES, Under Secretary of State for 
Tourism, Chenda Sophea Sok said: "The Australian consultancy, 
Lewis &amp; Partners, are among those who have been holding 
discussions with the Ministry of Tourism." 
  "The chosen consultancy will have to draw up the terms of 
reference for the calling of international tenders, marketing 
and promotional aspects of the tenders worldwide and related 
aspects. 
  Lewis &amp; Partners have the knowledge relevant to the 
implementation of casinos and integrated casino-related 
commercial and tourism projects. However, they will have to 
rope in, as with other proponents, the relevant real expertise 
in casino operations," Chenda said. 
  He added that the successful consultancy will have to work 
with the Cambodian Development Council (CDC) and the Ministry of 
Tourism for the final preparations of the international tender. 
  "With the establishment of the CDC and the impending 
ratification of the Investment Law, the international tender for 
the casino and the airport project will have full transparency 
and professionalism." 
  Chenda said that the international standard airport to be 
built on the existing airstrip, about 18 kilometres from the 
town centre of Sihanoukville, will serve as the catalyst for 
growth and investments. 
  "The airport will offer operational synergy to investors and 
casino patrons will be ferried to the island casino, most 
probably located on Koh Puos island, just off the Sihanoukville 
navy base." 
  The entire project is expected to be completed by 1997. The 
key words and essentials which the Ministry of Tourism and the 
CDC will be looking for is financial capacity, expertise and 
professionalism. 
  THE CAMBODIA TIMES has learnt that the casino project at 
Sihanoukville will be the only one as this will be one of the 
terms of reference demanded by the proposed investors of the 
project. 
  As such there will not be any other casinos situated 
elsewhere in the nation, such as in Siem Reap and Koh Kong as 
initially expected. 
  Lewis &amp; Partners was established in 1986 as a small 
dynamic 
agency specialising in Brisbane commercial sites and related 
projects. 
  Currently, they have ventured into various aspects of real 
estate development, including the Gold Coast of Australia and 
various other international standard projects. 
  Chenda added that among the early interested parties for the 
casino and comprehensive tourism project at Sihanoukville were 
two large public-listed Malaysian companies, Pilecon Bhd and 
Genting Bhd. 
  Genting Bhd already operates the casino in Malaysia and also 
operates various other casino and other hotels worldwide. 
  "With the establishment of the CDC and the new Investment 
Law, the proposals submitted by the two Malaysian companies will 
be integrated into the international tender." 
  "The tenders are to be completed by year end and a 
memorandum 
of understanding with physical works targeted to commence in 
early 1995," Chenda added. 
  He added that the Royal Government had decided to initiate 
the comprehensive casino and airport project as the casino 
project alone will see the payment of "Up-Front Funds" to the 
Government. 
  These funds can then be used for other related 
infrastructural development projects, THE CAMBODIA TIMES has 
learnt. 
  Besides the casino, Chenda said that various proposals have 
also been received for quality seaside resort projects at 
Sihanoukville. 
  "These are currently under review and will be forwarded to 
the CDC for its comments soon after the proposals are made more 
concrete and transparent," he added. 
  The casino, airport and hotel are expected to contribute 
greatly towards the socio-economic growth of Sihanoukville and 
create numerous employment opportunities.

  [Text] Cambodia's current account shortfall for 1993 is 
estimated to stand at U.S. $124.1 million, an increase of U.S. 
$29.7 million from the previous year's deficit. 
  According to the National Bank of Cambodia's [NBC's] 
Economic 
and Statistics Review for March, the breakdown of the deficit 
balances are U.S. $195.7 million for goods, U.S. $36.1 million 
for services and U.S. $42.6 million for the income account. 
  The trade deficit in 1993 marked an increase of U.S. $16.8 
million over the 1992 deficit, attributable to an 8 per cent 
increase in imports offset by a 7 per cent increase in exports. 
  Imports were estimated at U.S. $479.3 million while exports 
stood at U.S. $283.6 million for 1993. Sixty four per cent of 
all exports were reported to be re-exports of imported goods to 
countries in the region while timber exports accounted for 29.8 
per cent of total exports and rubber for 5 per cent. 
  It is clear that Cambodia would benefit from preferential 
trading status with the U.S., which has yet to be granted. This 
would attract companies from the region to set up their 
labour-intensive operations here to take advantage of 
concessions not normally available in their own country. 
  For example some observers suggest that Thai textile firms 
might set up manufacturing operations here. 
  Currently, cloth and textiles amount to 16.3 per cent of 
total imports, thus adding to the burden of the trade deficit, 
which has to be improved, as increased exports of goods are a 
valuable source of much needed hard currency. 
  The Cambodia Investment Board, the operating arm of the 
dormant Cambodia Development Council, has identified increase of 
exports as the primary "objectives of national and economic 
importance." 
  The Cambodian Tobacco Company, to cite an example of a local 
firm, exports its products to South Vietnam, but cannot compete 
with the larger and more established foreign tobacco companies 
operating in the region, which are propped up by huge 
advertising budgets. 
  Imported cigarettes amounted to 13.5 per cent of total 
imports, according to NBC estimates. Foreign tobacco companies 
use offshore media services to market their products, although a 
joint venture between a Cambodian media company and Singaporean 
media consultancy firm will fork out some of the profits to the 
resident owners of the service. 
  Net travel services was put at U.S. $44.3 million, a 
decrease 
of 11 per cent from the previous year -- a result of the 
reduction in tourist arrivals for the first half of 1993 -- 
according to the NBC report. 
  Construction materials chalked up 5.7 per cent of total 
imports of goods. 
  In the services sector, the deficit was largely a result of 
imported construction services, standing at U.S. $57.3 million. 
  According to the NBC report, this was "principally payments 
for infrastructure repairs carried out by non-resident 
contractors. 
  A net surplus in current transfers helped offset the total 
deficit balance. The NBC estimates that the net surplus stands 
at U.S. $150.2 million, although it cautions that the figures 
are "estimates and that the accuracy and completeness of the 
information on which they are based is very variable." 
  Furthermore, for statistical purposes, all payments made to 
non-residents by donor agencies are considered as having first 
being paid to the government, which then on paper, disburses 
this to non-residents. Such an arrangement places all 
non-residents working with NGOs [nongovernmental organizations] 
and other international organisations as government employees. 
  These payments, mobilised as funds for the government in the 
first place, are included in the category of current transfers. 
  The economy is still highly leveraged by transactions 
"reflecting international aid donations to the Government of 
Cambodia in the form of goods, short-term technical assistance 
and project aid" as well as capital project aid, under a 
separate account, which when combined with current transfers, 
amounts to U.S. $325.7 millions for 1993.

  [Text] The Khmer Journalist Association (KJA) suspects that 
the death of Thu Chhammongkol, editor of ANTARAKUM newspaper, 
was accidental. [as published] 
  Pin Samkhon, KJA president, told THE CAMBODIA TIMES that the 
life of journalism is being threatened, but he did not unfold 
the source of elements that inflicted the accident on the late 
editor. 
  Mongkol was found unconscious on a city street beside his 
motorbike two weeks ago and was later rushed to a hospital where 
he died the following day. Medical reports said there was a 
single blow on the back of his head. 
  ANTARAKUM or "Intervention" has published stories regarding 
scandals between common people and corrupted elements in the 
government and articles concerning conflicts among journalistic 
organisations. 
  For instance, it intervened in the conflict between the 
newspapers MORNING NEWS and KAOH SANTEPHEAP till the two 
newspapers stopped criticising and denouncing each other. 
  ANTARAKUM seldom covers critical stories against government 
officials. Nevertheless, the newspaper's office once 
experienced handbomb attacks which caused injuries to some of 
its staff. 
  Minister of Information, Ieng Muli, told an editorial 
meeting 
recently that the latest results of investigation into the 
incident revealed the editor's death was caused by a traffic 
accident. 
  However, the minister was still suspicious of the move 
behind 
the accident. 
  Pin Samkhon said Sin Sen, Under-Secretary of State for 
National Security affirmed that he would try to find out the 
truth. 
  "Whenever, all information and results of investigation are 
collected, I will invite all journalists to a news conference 
and by then, you will know what happened to the late editor, 
said Sin Sen, who was well-known in the time of the State of 
Cambodia for his leadership in intelligence service.

  [Text] In the old building at the Bayon Telecommunications 
Centre, there are still a couple of signs up in Khmer and 
Russian but probably not for long. 
  The original Soviet Intersputnik dish now carries nothing 
except for occasional TV transmissions and Telstra OTC's 
expatriate technicians have nearly completed their job of 
setting up a brand new International Telecommunications Centre 
for Phnom Penh. 
  The Standard 'A' satellite earth station is already 
completed 
and the necessary transmission equipment should be ready in time 
for commissioning in September this year. 
  The relationship between the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications (MPTC) and Telstra goes back to 1990, when 
the Australian company first approached the Cambodians with a 
proposal to develop the telecommunications sector. 
  Since then, Telstra has invested over U.S. $16 million of 
its 
own money in the Cambodian project. Russell Stuart, Telstra's 
senior representative in the country explained that 
telecommunications is "a revenue-generating industry...which can 
develop by itself". 
  The present financial arrangement is that MPTC will receive 
100 per cent of the revenue from outgoing calls as well as 51 
per cent of the revenue from incoming calls. Telstra gets the 
leftover 49 per cent. 
  The Australians are evidently making a long-term investment. 
  This was confirmed by Minister of Posts and 
Telecommunications, So Khun, on a visit to the new centre 
recently. He anticipated his ministry's relationship with 
Telstra continuing into the next century and said he "very much 
appreciated" Telstra's co-operation. 
  At present, subscriber calls first go to the General Post 
Office Exchange and then via fibre optic cable to the Bayon 
centre which currently has direct links to only four countries 
-- Japan, Australia, Singapore and Thailand. 
  From September, Phnom Penh subscribers will be linked 
straight to the new centre's earth station which will provide 
access to more than 200 countries worldwide. 
  Telstra brought in its own workers to install the 
telecommunications equipment but is training 150 Cambodian MPTC 
staff to take over the operation of the centre.

  [Text] Gyula Horn, leader of the Hungarian Socialist Party, 
who is the most likely candidate for the post of future 
Hungarian prime minister, said that the next Budapest government 
will advocate cultural autonomy for national minorities in 
neighboring states. In cases where a Hungarian minority is in 
effect a majority, the Hungarian Socialist chairman proposes 
administrative autonomy. This does not mean, however, we will be 
seeking to entice Hungarian minorities in neighboring states to 
strive for territorial autonomy or even separation, Horn added.

Socialist Party [MSZP]. [passage omitted] 
  Gyorgy Janosi has said that the possibility exists for the

Several journalists asked about the coalition issue and Gyorgy 
Janosi is replying just now. He says that they are thinking in

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Petoe, chairman of the Alliance of Free </F>
Democrats, SZDSZ, by Eva Hortobagyi at SZDSZ headquarters in 
Budapest on 29 May -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Hortobagyi] Here is Ivan Petoe, chairman of the 
SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats], whom I have managed to 
hijack for a few words before the session of the executive body 
of party. [passage omitted] According to forecasts your party 
has 23 mandates in the individual constituencies. [passage 
omitted] What are your first impressions? [passage omitted] 
  [Petoe] We had two aims. [passage omitted] One of these was 
to repeat our 1990 result, in that we should come a strong 
second. [passage omitted] Our second aim was--we formulated this 
between the two rounds of the election--to prevent if possible 
the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] from gaining an absolute 
majority because we thought that it would be more advantageous 
if better conditions for a coalition government developed. It 
seems that the electorate did not adopt this advice of ours. It 
appears that the MSZP's absolute majority is certain--about 55 
percent, if I understand the forecast correctly. The electorate 
decided in favor of a one-party government. 
  This does not mean, naturally, that we will not negotiate 
with the MSZP. Our convention [kueldoett gyueles] will have the 
final word. [passage omitted] The convention will decide on the 
coalition question. We have already indicated between the two 
rounds of the election that the coalition conditions will be 
very different if the MSZP were to have an absolute majority 
from conditions if it were not to. [passage omitted] 
  [Hortobagyi] Is there any big winner or big loser in the 
SZDSZ? 
  [Petoe] [passage omitted] I do not think there was a big 
loser in the SZDSZ, taking everything as a whole, because the 
SZDSZ has delivered a good result as a team. We are satisfied 
with our achievement. [passage omitted] 
  According to forecasts, Gabor Fodor and Gabor Kuncze will 
win 
in their constituencies. My position appears to be the reverse. 
I am a loser, shall we say. If you like, I am a big loser.

<F P=106> [Interview with Imre Szekeres, executive deputy chairman of </F>
the Hungarian Socialist Party, by unidentified reporter in 
Budapest -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Reporter] [passage omitted] What is your 
reaction to the election results so far? 
  [Szekeres] Naturally, we are pleased that our deputies were 
so successful, for this expresses the trust of the voters and 
shows that they support not only the general policies of our 
party but also our candidates. 
  [Reporter] The result expected by the Alliance of Free 
Democrats [SZDSZ] -- that they would gain enough votes to 
counterbalance the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] -- did not 
come about. 
  [Szekeres] Yes, but I do not think this is an important 
issue 
now. Our stance is very clear: We said between the two rounds 
-- and we are saying it now -- that in Hungary a broad-based 
coalition government is needed and this does not depend on the 
percentage of votes obtained by any one party. There is an 
historic opportunity here for the country. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] When will the coalition talks begin? 
  [Szekeres] [passage omitted] Next week a preliminary 
decisionmaking process will start within the MSZP in light of 
the election results, which will end at the party's congress on 
Saturday. We will decide two things: One, we will have to name 
the parties which we envisage as participants in the coalition 
talks. Two, we have to name our prime ministerial candidate. 
  After this, the coalition talks between the parties can 
begin. Our goal is that the country should have a government as 
soon as possible; by the beginning of July the new government 
should be composed and voted in by parliament. 
  [Reporter] Would you specifically name some parties which 
could be counted as coalition partners? 
  [Szekeres] [passage omitted] I think the SZDSZ and the 
Federation of Young Democrats are the two political parties 
whose programs are compatible with ours. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Does the MSZP maintain that the winning party 
should name the prime minister? 
  [Szekeres] I think that logically this is what the situation 
dictates, and we will name our candidate at the coalition talks. 
However, the government's program has to be settled first at the 
talks. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with President Arpad Goncz by unidentified </F>
reporter at the Duna Palace in Budapest -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Reporter] As president of the Republic, what do 
you consider to be the next important thing from the country's 
point of view, the thing which you advise to the country? 
  [Goncz] That the country should have a stable and acceptable 
government. 
  [Reporter] The people have expressed their view quite 
radically and -- in both rounds of the elections -- quite 
massively, in terms of turnout. 
  [Goncz] The people deserve respect and honor for this. 
  [Reporter] However, after this, should the parties not be 
expected to effect the transition in a similarly radical and 
speedily manner? Will you ask the party leaders tomorrow to do 
this? 
  [Goncz] That goes without saying. The campaign, the election 
is over, now all parties must bear in mind the welfare of the 
country. 
  [Reporter] When do you plan to convene the National 
Assembly? 
  [Goncz] The National Assembly must be convened within 30 
days 
of the announcement of the election result, but I sincerely hope 
that I will be able to convene it as soon as possible. I cannot 
give a date. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, when can peace and calm be 
expected 
to prevail in the country again? 
  [Goncz] I do not feel that the country is in a state of war. 
I could hardly have conceived a more peaceful election. So, I 
believe that the state of calm will be reestablished soon -- the 
campaign is over. As to when the nation's peace of mind is to 
prevail, let me say that it will occur if the nation can draw a 
final account of all the phases of its history prior to 1918 and 
close that account. However, it might take a generation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of </F>
Young Democrats, Fidesz, by correspondent Attila Kert at the 
Fidesz election center -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Kert] Good evening. Fidesz Chairman Viktor 
Orban is sitting in front of me. [passage omitted] An hour ago 
Imre Szekeres, executive chairman of the MSZP [Hungarian 
Socialist Party], said quite definitely that the Fidesz could be 
regarded as a potential coalition partner. 
  [Orban recording] We received no official note of any kind 
about this. Regarding forming a coalition, the Fidesz National 
Executive will decide. My position is well known on this issue: 
I am not in favor of this cooperation. We will not enter into 
informal talks. [passage omitted] 
  [Kert] What about the future of the liberal cooperation? You 
said a few hours ago that it was on the brink of collapse. Can 
this cooperation go on? 
  [Orban] The first thing I have to say is that the 
cooperation 
of the liberal parties, on which the strategy of every liberal 
party was built during the election campaign, has failed. 
Everybody has done rather badly. Two out of the four parties 
did not even get in. We lagged behind expectations and the SZDSZ 
[Alliance of Free Democrats] obtained fewer seats than in 1990. 
Thus, on the basis of the voters' judgment, the whole idea of 
the liberal-center proved to be an unsuccessful idea. 
  As to what to do now, I cannot yet say. I feel that the key 
to the situation is in the hands of the SZDSZ, for they were the 
ones who left the possibility of cooperating with the MSZP open. 
It seems that they are willing to form a government together 
with the MSZP. 
  [Kert] What if the two parties find themselves in opposition 
to one another in parliament? 
  [Orban] The Fidesz National Executive will discuss this and 
decide on the matter. [passage omitted] 
  [Kert] Many people say that Fidesz, with its negative 
election campaign, contributed to the success of the MSZP. 
  [Orban] I do not agree with these opinions. We put two 
targets in front of us: One, to bring about a replacement of the 
government -- this was successful. Two, to prevent the comeback 
of the old (?guard)--this was not. [passage omitted] 
  [Kert] Finally, what sort of future do you expect for the 
Fidesz and what about your own role? 
  [Orban] We have to put the ranks in order. [passage omitted] 
I will be a parliamentary deputy and I would like to work for a 
bourgeois Hungary in parliament; I think there is a chance for 
this. I do not think that the fate of Fidesz is more difficult 
than in 1990. [passage omitted] 
  [Kert] Is it conceivable that the Fidesz will get back on 
its 
feet? 
  [Orban] Since we did not lie down, we will stand up. We will 
bow our head to the winners but we will not bend our knees. 
[passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Imre Szekeres, executive deputy chairman of </F>
the Hungarian Socialist Party, by unidentified correspondent on 
29 May; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Our subject for discussion now is 
foreign policy. If a country is small and, what is more, 
one-third of its nation [allamalkoto nemzetisegenek] lives 
beyond its borders, it must conduct a particularly active and 
sensitive foreign policy. Let us now see what the 
representatives of the parliamentary parties expect from the new 
government. Here are some recordings: 
  [Szekeres] I think the new government--provided that it is 
formed by the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party]--will have three 
simultaneous foreign policy tasks. First, to speed up Hungary's 
participation in European integration. Second, to settle our 
relations with neighboring countries. Third, and this is an 
issue that ranks equal to the first two, to represent the 
interests of the Hungarian minority living beyond the country's 
borders, including support for their efforts to achieve various 
types of autonomy. 
  I think that these three foreign policy goals are 
interdependent. In other words, neither can succeed without the 
other. I think this presupposes on the part of the new 
government a very serious and very firm and proactive foreign 
policy. 
  [Correspondent] What does the Balladur conference that took 
place earlier this week indicate? 
  [Szekeres] [passage omitted] It has become clear that in 
East 
Central Europe and in the Baltics, where such problems create 
serious tensions between countries and within countries, and 
unsolved situations, some kind of coordination process has 
started now. 
  We have no illusions. Such a process will be very long and 
will mean very complicated negotiations, but all opportunities 
must be exploited to permit Hungary and the Hungarian nation 
that lives inside and outside the borders to be able to digest 
at last the trauma of the Trianon Treaty, to find at last the 
modus vivendi in which the Hungarian nation, inside and outside 
the Hungarian border, can live its Hungarianness to the full and 
be able to find the balance that must necessarily come about 
between the majority nations and the Hungarian minority of the 
other countries. 
  [Correspondent] How will the MSZP address the Hungarian 
community [magyarsag]? 
  [Szekeres] In accordance with European norms, the new prime 
minister of the Hungarian Government will be the prime minister 
of 10.5 million Hungarians. However, at the same time, he will 
be a representative, in some form, of the other 3.5 million 
Hungarians living outside the borders. I would very much 
dislike it if the past four years repeated themselves and the 
Hungarian organizations beyond the borders were used as a 
backdrop. I would very much dislike it if the interests of 
Hungarians became a party political question, for this affects 
the whole of the nation. Therefore, every element of the issue, 
that is people acting in cultural life, in government or in the 
economy, have a role in this. We would like to coordinate and 
integrate this work. 
  [Correspondent] Will there be a need in the future for the 
office dealing with the matters of the Hungarians beyond the 
borders? 
  [Szekeres] We have not been working on concrete government 
drafts like this yet. However, I think that the cultivation of 
links -- cultural cooperation and economic links between the 
mother country and the minority Hungarians -- have to be 
integrated by all means. An agreement has to be reached about 
the structural forms of this. In my view, it is not the 
priority but rather the quality of this task that is important. 
  [Correspondent] Our viewers worry about the future of Duna 
Television. 
  [Szekeres] No decision has been made yet about television 
issues, naturally, but I think there is a need for a broadcast 
that can reach the Hungarians beyond the borders and if 
possible, the Hungarians spread across Europe. As to the form 
of editing and method of operation involved, this has to be 
settled with the profession.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian </F>
Socialist Party, by unidentified correspondent in Budapest -- 
live] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] In view of the easy way you were 
able to take the 40-degree centigrade heat at the news briefing, 
it is rather gratuituous for me to ask whether you, Mr. 
Chairman, are well? 
  [Horn] Thank you. I am as normal as any average man. In a 
few weeks this trophy [reference to the metal support-frame he 
wears around his neck and head as a result of a recent car 
crash] will be off my head early next week. In other words, the 
traces of the break are slowly disappearing. 
  [Correspondent] If I understood your words correctly, 
discussion about coalition negotiations, let alone ministerial 
posts, is meaningful only after the Hungarian Socialist Party 
[MSZP] congress, after joint coordinations. Nothing until then? 
  [Horn] [passage omitted] We convened the congress for 4 
June. 
We will decide then. [passage omitted] I think that it is most 
obvious that it is the party that came second in the elections, 
the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats], can be considered as a 
possible coalition partner. [passage omitted] I hope they take 
seriously the responsibility the election presented them. 
[passage omitted]. This country needs a viable parliament and 
government. 
  An MSZP-SZDSZ government alliance may mean it will not be 
too 
difficult to agree on the most important tasks and that the two 
parties' agreement with each other may open a path toward a 
wider alliance. Under this, which I think would be very good, a 
relationship should be shaped in the future or in the new 
government between the six parliamentary parties different from 
the current one. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Certainly your party has become the 
strongest 
party of the would-be coalition at this election. How do you 
wish to use this power? 
  [Horn] The most important thing is to put right the affairs 
of the country. [passage omitted] We have said the 
transformation can be executed in a different way from the 
present manner. In other words, we said it was possible to 
conduct a policy in which people are put in the focus. It is 
unacceptable for us that the transformation should be carried 
out in such a way that the great majority of people should lose 
out as a result. A burden-sharing in proportion to income must 
be created. [passage omitted] 
  People's lives must be made more secure, and I do not mean 
by 
this public safety only, but also job availability, education, 
and the assurance of all other aspects of existence. What we 
also need, shall we say, is a policy with a human face, which 
means also that we must solicit the views of a broad range of 
people in all essential questions. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] [passage omitted] Among the 2 million people 
who voted for the MSZP, many have recently lost their social 
status; that is, the middle stratum that makes a country strong 
and capable of progress. Can the MSZP offer something to them? 
  [Horn] I recently read an analysis of the kind of people who 
have voted for the MSZP. The widest support has come from those 
living on wages and salaries, the workers and peasants in the 
villages. There are also very many entrepreneurs. [passage 
omitted] Third, there is the middle stratum you mention, which 
is sliding down on the social scale: teachers, public employees, 
artists, and others. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Do you see a realistic chance for carrying 
out all the changes you envisage? 
  [Horn] If there was not a chance we would not start this 
task. This is why I started the news conference by quoting Franz 
Vrantizky, who called me to congratulate me and tell me the 
difficult part was just beginning. He is entirely right. For 
although it is a great pleasure to know the Socialist Party 
enjoys such huge support, it is also a great responsibility. 
[passage omitted] I think the greatest strength of the 
Socialist Party lies in its expertise. Thus people can have 
faith that the Socialist Party will start dealing with matters 
professionally. 
  [Correspondent] Have you got some sort of emergency aid 
package? 
  [Horn] We have got a package that has already been disclosed 
regarding social and employment policy, economic and social 
agreements. It is a short term action program to be completed 
within the year, in 1994. 
  [Correspondent] So rapid changes can be expected? 
  [Horn] Yes, yes. There are a lot of silly things in this 
country. Several laws and decrees were adopted, structures and 
practices evolved, and we protested against them to no avail. 
Being in an opposition role, of course, there was not much 
impact of our protest. [passage omitted] So many things can be 
changed without applying investments worth billions of forints, 
by way of which the life of people can be improved. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Correspondent] You said at the news conference that Hungary 
was in need of foreign help more than ever. What did you mean 
by this? 
  [Horn] It is quite understandable the activity of foreign 
capital came to a halt for the time being. This is quite 
natural, and this is not some sort of no-confidence in the 
outgoing government, but a kind of waiting. Well, there is an 
enormous need for foreign capital, but at the same time, 
internal laws also have to be adopted that will stipulate 
definite conditions regarding the activity of foreign capital; 
that is, it should not mean only the buying of markets, as it 
happened in many cases. 
  The other thing is that this country will need new money. 
Very serious amounts of money will be needed so that genuine 
investment activity can take place and to generate economic 
growth, even if of a modest rate. 
  Last but not least, this country is struggling with a huge 
debt. There is sufficient reserve in 1994 to fulfill this debt 
repayment obligation. But what will happen in 1995 and the 
ensuing years? Will all our money go on repayment of the 
interests and the instalments? For then we really will not have 
any internal reserves or internal resources for development. So 
all this has to be thought through. [passage omitted] 
  Thus a lot of things could be mobilized to put this country 
back on its feet. Our conviction is that without foreign help 
getting back on our feet cannot be done. 
  [Correspondent] The press wrote a lot about the fact that 
the 
MSZP did not quite manage to get rid of its image associating it 
with the former HSWP [Hungarian Socialist Workers Party]. How 
does the party relate to these old members? 
  [Horn] Look, I would very much like if in 1994, as a result 
of the elections, we would close this dwelling in the past. Not 
because we have nothing to say about the past, but because we 
want to deal with the future. [passage omitted] People judged 
that the policy of change cannot go on as it has done in the 
past four years; they want change. They considered that the 
Socialist Party can manage and lead this policy of transition 
better than the present government. It is possible they will 
put their faith into another party in 1998. [passage omitted] 
  We will work hard so that they should not be disappointed. 
Anyway, the nature of a left wing party worldwide is to work in 
the interest of the majority. So it is possible to deal with 
the past, but nobody's life will improve one iota in this tiny 
homeland. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] 
has won 22 parliamentary seats and come in fifth in the 
Hungarian parliamentary elections. KDNP Party Chairman Laszlo 
Surjan assesses the result and the future. 
  [Begin recording] [Surjan] [passage omitted] As we know, the 
transformation from a planned to a market economy and many other 
circumstances have brought very great disappointment because 
only very few people have attained a higher standard of living. 
In practice, the living standard of all citizens has declined. 
  Until now we have had a role in a coalition, a role we 
played 
as a partner of that coalition with moderate strength. Now we 
would like to participate in Hungarian public life in a much 
more marked manner and with a much better defined character but 
independently of others, relying on our own strength and our own 
ideas. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Does it mean that the KDNP 
cannot accept fully its participation in the bloc of 
pro-national forces which the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum] 
is trying to form? 
  [Surjan] The significance of a bloc of pro-national forces 
is 
yet to be thought through. I myself am afraid of this term. 
Naturally, we must think together, just as we have undertaken 
this -- we have even created serious tensions within the party 
-- by trying to help each other in the second round through 
withdrawing in favor of each other. Unfortunately, without 
result. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] is ready for 
coalition talks with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] but 
these talks will be much more difficult because the Socialists 
have gained an absolute majority in the Hungarian parliament. 
This was stated by party Chairman Ivan Petoe, who added that 
the coalition consultations could begin as early as next week. 
However, Peter Hack, another SZDSZ leader, described as 
doubtful the possibility of a coalition agreement after a 
Socialist Party victory of such magnitude. According to Hack, 
the electorate has unambiguously placed its trust in the hands 
of one party and the SZDSZ would not be able to play an emphatic 
coalition partner role if it were to participate in the 
government.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive interview" with Hungarian Socialist Party </F>
Chairman Gyula Horn by reporter Peter Gyuricza; place and date 
not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Gyuricza] Mr. Chairman, you have promised that 
a new policy has to prevail in Hungary from June. What does 
this mean in practice? 
  [Horn] This means, first and foremost, that the real 
problems 
of the people have to be dealt with. This means that the new 
parliament and the new government should not deal with masses of 
abstract ideological questions. This really means that all 
questions, without whose solution we cannot ease the people's 
fate and life, must be put on the agenda on the first day after 
the formation of the new government, if possible. There are a 
lot of questions of this kind. 
  [Gyuricza] Some examples? 
  [Horn] I mean, first of all, the social strata in the most 
difficult situation -- pensioners, families with many children, 
young career-starters; we have to ensure that people are housed 
and that in practice these young people can get a job. Just 
look at the catastrophic housing situation. The new government 
cannot avoid establishing a credit system, with state 
participation, for the construction of homes or for the 
acquisition of homes. This is no longer just another of the 
many promises being made, since the elections are behind us. 
  Concerning all this, I am convinced that we have to keep in 
mind -- since we could spend hours just listing all these 
necessary steps -- that people do not exist to implement a 
change of system; on the contrary, the change of system has to 
serve the people. There was some kind of misunderstanding here 
over the past months and years -- as though the change of system 
was regarded as an abstract aim. [passage omitted] 
  [Gyuricza] [passage omitted] Will the MSZP [Hungarian 
Socialist Party] be forced to form a coalition, or should we 
regard a coalition as a necessity? 
  [Horn] There is no necessity for a coalition because we have 
an adequate majority, but we do want a coalition. We would like 
to form a coalition. 
  [Gyuricza] At what price? 
  [Horn] Not at any price, obviously. [passage omitted] 
  [Gyuricza] Is it possible that you could be the object or 
the 
stake of the coalition talks? 
  [Horn] I do not think so. Why should that be? [passage 
omitted] 
  [Gyuricza] Before the elections you said you would not be 
short of coalition partners. What are you thinking of, or not 
thinking of, in addition to the Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ]? 
  [Horn] We also said that we are open about the Federation of 
Young Democrats [Fidesz]. Well, Fidesz got far poorer results 
than they expected. [passage omitted] I naturally think there 
are a lot of valuable people there. 
  We have asked the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] 
to get rid of its extremists. The election campaign showed that 
they have not managed to do this, or have not wanted to this. 
However, I do not think the KDNP would reject a coalition 
cooperation proposal if I offered it. 
  [Gyuricza] You have said that your first journey will be to 
Bonn. Why? 
  [Horn] On the one hand, because I consider Hungarian-German 
ties as being exceptionally important. On the other hand, I 
have personal links with the present German leaders -- including 
Chancellor Kohl and others -- and this will make it possible to 
conclude an agreement, or series of agreements, which would 
significantly ease the treatment of the acute and very serious 
illnesses of the Hungarian economy. [passage omitted] 
  I am not planning to hand them an invoice. We are not 
talking about some kind of repayment of debts, which has not 
been completed yet. However, it has to be considered that our 
country is in a very serious situation and that Hungarian-German 
relations could ease these difficulties.

  [Excerpts] After the results of the second round of the 
parliamentary elections, the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] 
is forced to give up the possibility of recommending a nominee 
for the post of prime minister to the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist 
Party], which finished first in the election. This was 
discussed, among other things, at the SZDSZ press briefing. 
Judit Laszlo reports from there. 
  [Laszlo] [passage omitted] Considering the chances for a 
coalition, party Chairman Ivan Petoe said that the SZDSZ did not 
view the distribution of ministries purely as a mathematical 
exercise. Were the MSZP-SZDSZ coalition to come into being, it 
would be the result of a historic compromise, Petoe said. 
[passage omitted] 
  The price of the compromise is that the would-be coalition 
should implement a liberal economic program but the SZDSZ would 
like to see the personnel guarantees for this too, Petoe said. 
He also stressed that the SZDSZ would be able to conduct 
coalition negotiations only with a united MSZP, because the 
SZDSZ does not wish to set itself up as a judge to decide over 
the issues of dispute that exist between the various wings of 
the MSZP. 
  An MSZP-SZDSZ coalition is inconceivable unless a compromise 
solution is arrived at in respect of the person of the prime 
minister. At the same time, the SZDSZ is not in a position to 
make recommendations for the person of the prime minister, it 
was said at the press briefing. [passage omitted]

Levente Suekoesd reports: 
  [Suekoesd] Spokeswoman Krisztina Szilagyi told our program 
that at the meeting of the KDNP executive committee today a 
decision was made to exclude the possibility of coalition with 
the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party]. The spokeswoman also said 
that at the meeting of the national executive to be held on 25 
June, the leadership would resign; it will operate as an acting 
body until the new leadership is elected.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula </F>
Horn and Gabor Kuncze, leader of the Alliance of Free Democrats, 
by correspondent Gabor Bankuti in the studio on 30 May -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Bankuti] [passage omitted] If I remember 
correctly, you were the first to suggest the idea of joining 
NATO? 
  [Horn] Yes, I said this at the beginning of 1990, taking 
Hungary's situation into consideration. For I am yet to be 
shown another state having such a large national minority living 
beyond its borders than Hungary. There are nearly 4 million 
people living in the vicinity beyond our borders and this has 
always been the source of some sort of tension. When we raise 
our voice to secure their rights, it inevitably creates tensions 
in bilateral state relations. 
  Therefore, it would have been good if NATO related to us a 
little bit differently than to the other neighboring countries, 
taking Hungary's special position into consideration. However, 
this is a question for NATO; it is their affair and they should 
have perhaps followed a slightly more circumspect policy toward 
us. 
  [Bankuti] But I think your views have not changed on this 
score. 
  [Horn] Not at all. I remain a believer in joining the 
Western European integration organizations. I wish to remind 
people that the predecessor of this government, of which I was 
also a member, submitted the bid for associate membership. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Bankuti] Your party says that the eastern markets have to 
be 
revived. However, these eastern markets have collapsed. 
  [Horn] [passage omitted] We can see that the western markets 
are rather limited for us, precisely because of the recession, 
which we talked about earlier. However, I consider that, for 
example, in the field of agriculture....[pauses] We can put 
agriculture back on its feet and we want to do this. If there 
is a national issue, than it is the issue of putting agriculture 
back on its feet. The market for our products from agriculture 
and the food industry can primarily be eastern Europe. 
  I agree that the method of payment for goods is the greatest 
difficulty in relation to the eastern markets. However, if need 
be, we have to adjust to the conditions. If need be, we have to 
create barter trade, product for product. It is not the most 
modern form but excuse me, we have to stay alive, what is more, 
we have to progress. [passage omitted] The task of a 
government is to create the fiscal and other conditions and 
structures to enable the progress of this kind of trade. So we 
cannot give up the eastern markets, which, nevertheless, does 
not mean the weakening of Hungary's relations with the western 
states in the least. 
  [Bankuti] [passage omitted] Let us now listen to our talks 
with Gabor Kuncze [leader of the Alliance of Free Democrats, 
SZDSZ]. [passage omitted] 
  [Kuncze] The current situation must not be conceived as if 
the opposition roundtable was now being reformed again, as if 
the opposition were again in a resolute confrontation with the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], should the MSZP form a 
government on its own. [passage omitted] 
  [Bankuti] Still, once upon a time you [the Alliance of Free 
Democrats] were in alliance with the other opposition parties, 
whereas now you think that this MSZP is different from that 
MSZP, or rather its predecessor the MSZMP [Hungarian Socialist 
Workers Party], with which the opposition roundtable negotiated. 
  [Kuncze] This MSZP is certainly not the MSZMP, it is 
different even in name, it refuses even to identify itself with 
the MSZMP past. The MSZP has been conducting its policy in 
parliament during the past four years and on the basis of all 
this one must not identify the MSZP with the earlier MSZMP. I 
agree with this. [passage omitted] 
  [Bankuti] [passage omitted] Is there full unity within the 
MSZP? 
  [Kuncze] [passage omitted] It is not my task to speak about 
the internal affairs of the MSZP and I would not like to do so. 
Obviously there are problems there because it is perhaps not by 
coincidence that the MSZP was unable to name a candidate for the 
post of prime minister. The question is whether it will be the 
ideas of Laszlo Bekesi and those around him that will prevail or 
the line of Gyula Horn and Sandor Nagy that will be followed. 
There is a great question mark as to what is happening to 
Matyas Szueroes and those around him. However, I consider this 
to be an MSZP internal affair and I am not sure that I have to 
deal with this. 
  However, one thing is certain: The SZDSZ -- should there be 
any coalition negotiations -- can conceive of such negotiations 
only on the basis of the MSZP's written economic program, a 
program that Laszlo Bekesi described as a liberal-minded 
economic program. From this point of view it is interesting 
that last week Sandor Nagy published a statement in which he 
addressed the issue of a coalition with the SZDSZ saying that it 
would be a very difficult one, because for a Socialist Party a 
liberal economic policy is unacceptable. [passage omitted] 
  [Bankuti] Would you like to comment on this? 
  [Horn] Well, I have to comment quite a lot. [passage 
omitted] 
As to what kind of trends exist within the MSZP, well let me 
tell you again, and please believe me: The MSZP has one economic 
program. This program was prepared by Laszlo Bekesi and this 
program was adopted by the MSZP congress. This program was 
adopted by the candidates of the party, Sandor Nagy included. 
As to how this program can be realized -- and let me tell you 
that many outsiders considered it to contain more liberal 
elements than the similar program of the SZDSZ -- this is an 
enormous question. Nobody has the panacea for solving the 
problems of the country. 
  So we have one program and it is time to stop this debate 
about which trend will be the winner. People usually say that I 
represent the so-called centrist line. I do not mind this 
description at all. However, I would rather say that I represent 
the line that unites the different views within the party and 
prevents the party's cart being tugged this way and that way, 
neither to the right nor to the left. I consider this very 
important. 
  Naturally, there are differences of opinion within the party 
that only proves that this is a big party. [passage omitted] 
If we manage to come to an agreement with the SZDSZ, I 
emphasize, the program adopted at our congress on 28 February 
1994 will be realized. [passage omitted] 
  What we promised during the election campaign is true: We 
want to improve the situation of the people and we want to start 
this as soon as tomorrow. No, we want to start today. We 
pledged our life and our political work to this.

  [Excerpts] Hungarian President Arpad Goncz received the 
leading representatives of the parties in the parliament 
building earlier today. 
  [Begin Goncz recording] [passage omitted] If I myself had to 
define what the electorate voted for or against I would say that 
the country had two desires. One of these is that the country 
itself should not break into two societies -- with a society of 
the poor people on the one hand and a society of those amassing 
immeasurable riches for themselves on the other. Parallel with 
this -- obviously not consciously -- is that we should not break 
into two parts, east and west Hungary. 
  As a result of the election the parties have several moral 
obligations. First, they should focus their energies to achieve 
an economic revival as much as possible and in accordance with a 
thorough plan. Neither the government nor parliament can 
fulfill this task on its own. In the interest of a common 
objective, a national consensus must be established -- as wide 
as possible -- for the fulfillment of this goal. In other 
words, in my judgment efforts should be made for establishing a 
coalition government, but naturally I cannot interfere in this, 
nor do I want to. [passage omitted] 
  I must add that I am convinced that the electorate of the 
country has helped bring to victory a future modern and European 
social democratic party. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] On election night Gyula Horn, chairman of the MSZP 
[Hungarian Socialist Party], gave several interviews in which he 
outlined the party's program. Now, however, he is speaking 
about foreign policy questions: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] You said that 
your first visit will take you to Bonn. Will the second one be 
to Brussels? A year ago you were not the first to raise the 
question of Hungary's NATO membership. 
  [Horn] Yes, but now, when referring to Brussels, I was 
thinking not of NATO but the European Union [EU]. It is very 
important -- and I supported the present government's intentions 
on this -- that Hungary's association treaty with the EU should 
really be amended. It must be improved, it must be improved in 
our favor. The way in which Brussels relates to Hungary and the 
other states in the east central Europe region is very important 
because I believe that the time for deeds has arrived. So there 
should not be just piles and piles of statements by the Twelve 
about the region; they should give more than they have been 
giving so far to help this region. 
  [Correspondent] We would like to improve relations with 
neighboring countries, but in past years we have seen that on 
the other side there is insufficient will to receive these 
attempts. How will the new government resolve this? 
  [Horn] Look, there are surely Funars [prominent Romanian 
nationalist mayor of Cluj-Napoca] elsewhere too, not only in 
Romania. [passage omitted] However, this must not be our point 
of departure. I believe that Hungary has no enemies either 
along its border or further away. On the contrary, it has 
partners, and if we can strengthen the partnership relationship, 
if we can build up their trust in our intentions -- and we have 
already said that we would like to bring about a historical 
reconciliation with our neighbors and a lot should be done to 
this end -- I am sure that they will receive our moves 
favorably. [end recording]

  [Text] According to Gyula Horn [chairman of the Hungarian 
Socialist Party -- MSZP], coalition talks should start as early 
as next week, providing both the MSZP and the SZDSZ [Alliance of 
Free Democrats] agree to cooperate. This was said by the MSZP 
chairman in Hungarian TV's "Napkelte" [Sunrise] program. 
  Speaking about relations with the unions, Horn said that if 
the new government fails to reach an agreement with the 
organizations representing the interests of those living on 
wages and salaries, there will be no social peace, and in that 
case no self-moderation by the principal protagonists in 
political and social life could be expected, despite the fact 
that this is overwhelmingly necessary. 
  If trade unions experience, as they have in the past four 
years, that agreements which they sign are subsequently kicked 
aside by the government, then whatever the composition of the 
new government, confrontation will inevitably arise between the 
unions and the government, Gyula Horn warned. He added that 
Sandor Nagy [chairman of the National Federation of Hungarian 
Trade Unions] also believes that an economic and social 
agreement should be reached as soon as possible. In the 
framework of the agreement they would handle the crisis in a way 
contrary to the method used by the previous government, which 
would permit an improvement for those living on wages and 
salaries.

  [Horn] No. A return to communism in Hungary is out of the 
question. The wheel of history cannot be reversed. Despite the 
great election victory, we in the Socialist Party want to rule 
in a coalition. 
  [BILD] Are you going to stop the privatization?

quickly as possible. Therefore my first foreign trip will be to 
Germany.

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish President Lech Walesa by Edith Heller </F>
in Warsaw; date not given: "The Poles Have Always Found a Way 
Out"] 
  [Text] [Heller] The news we get from Poland is very 
contradictory. On the one hand, Poland has the highest economic 
growth rate in Europe -- some people even speak about the future 
"European tiger." On the other hand, your successor in the 
"Solidarity" trade union, Krzaklewski, said recently that there 
have been as many as 774 strikes this year. Doesn't that prove 
that a large part of the population does not see any progress? 
  [Walesa] If you view Poland from the perspective of stable 
democracies, you may consider what is happening in our country 
as anarchy. But you cannot measure us by your standards. Prior 
to our revolution, we were all equally poor. Now we are 
building capitalism -- which has led to gross inequalities. The 
people do not strike because they are worse off than in the 
past, but because others are better off than they. The strikes 
are not protests against the reforms. They are protests for the 
reforms -- for more justice, more law, and more security. 
  [Heller] How large are the percentages of "winners" and 
"losers"? 
  [Walesa] I would say one-third of the people have already 
the same or even a better living standards than the people in 
the West. Another 30 percent live a bit better than they did 
four years ago. Approximately 20-30 percent are a bit worse off. 
These latter people live in small towns where the only factory 
was closed down and no new ones have been set up. 
  [Heller] Is the number of discontented people large enough 
to provoke serious social unrest? 
  [Walesa] A total of 20 percent discontented people would be 
a lot if they were concentrated in Warsaw or Gdansk. But these 
people are spread throughout the country. That is why a massive 
outbreak of dissatisfaction cannot be anticipated. 
  [Heller] However, the success is measurable. Last year, the 
gross domestic product increased by 4 percent, production and 
consumption by 8 percent each. Where do you see the cause of 
this success? 
  [Walesa] It was important for us to get rid of our 
handcuffs. 
  [Heller] That does not always work. Many reform states have 
made similar efforts. 
  [Walesa] There are cleverer and less-clever people. The 
Poles have always found a way out. 
  [Heller] However, regarding foreign investment, Poland is 
still lagging behind Hungary, which is much smaller. German and 
Austrian investors see more favorable conditions in the Czech 
Republic. What advantages do your neighbors offer? 
  [Walesa] Today they are better, but tomorrow, our system 
will at least be twice as effective. The Czech Republic has had 
good results with small changes. Take agriculture, for 
instance. We are about to really privatize everything. In the 
Czech Republic, they have not even started privatizing the 
agricultural sector. 
  The Czechs also proceeded differently with the privatization 
of industry. They distributed shares and vouchers in their 
companies. If I said that this is a "higher form of socialism," 
they would perhaps be offended -- but it actually was a sort of 
distribution system. That is why everything went relatively 
fast. What we are doing is try and find new individual owners 
for as many companies as possible -- and that takes longer. 
  [Heller] Don't you see a danger that privatization in Poland 
will be slowed down by the new left-wing government? 
  [Walesa] No. The change of government last fall has led the 
process a bit off course, but it will get back on the right 
track again. 
  [Heller] Do you think Poland will, in the foreseeable 
future, be accepted into the European Union and NATO? 
  [Walesa] The West should be more interested in our 
membership than we are, for the following simple reason: We are 
lagging 10 or even 20 years behind. We will catch up, whereas 
you will run the risk of falling behind, if you isolate yourself. 
  The West suffers from overproduction. We lack production 
capacities. That is why the West should have an interest in 
taking us in, in order to make money and fill the gaps. 
  You also draw superficial conclusions in connection with 
NATO. You say that we are afraid of Russia and therefore want to 
seek refuge with the West. However, that is not true. The 
Russians do not threaten us; they had us, and we did not do them 
good. If the Russians want to have someone, it is you, the West 
-- not us. 
  [Heller] If Poland is not threatened, could it not become 
a neutral state like Switzerland? 
  [Walesa] Poland is too large. Its central position between 
east and west, north and south plays a role in this respect. 
Poland cannot afford neutrality, nor will the world permit it 
to be neutral. 
  [Heller] One of the factors deciding on Poland's future is 
inner stability. We are having doubts in this respect. You 
fight against every government, and there is a permanent "war of 
the elites." 
  [Walesa] Do not forget that we do not yet have a ready 
system, we do not even have a new constitution! I provoke, in 
order to point out shortcomings. The point is not my person. I 
have assumed the task of leading my country in this difficult 
time, in order to build a new and modern Poland. A good system 
is created by way of discussion and debate. 
  [Heller] Why are you seeking a presidential system? Could a 
strong government, controlled by Parliament, and a merely 
"representative" president not serve Poland equally well? 
  [Walesa] Of course. But the difficulties regarding the 
reforms are like a storm at sea. In such a moment, there cannot 
be 10 captains on board. That is why we need a good helmsman 
with more options than in the past. 
  In addition, you will certainly also have heard that my 
popularity is declining. However, it is only declining because 
I am not efficient. I know what to do, but I cannot carry it 
out, because I do not have executive powers. The people tell me 
that I promised something but did not keep my word. All this 
will repeat itself with the next president. 
  [Heller] How do you feel as president? You complained the 
other day that you do not have enough time to fulfill your 
duties as husband. 
  [Walesa] In times of large changes and great reforms, it is, 
of course, a tough job. Once law and order and stability have 
been restored, one will like this office.

<F P=106> [Relayed by Warsaw TV Polonia Network in Polish; passages </F>
within quotation marks are recorded] 
  [Text] President Lech Walesa has called the information 
contained in Boris Yeltsin's recent book a misunderstanding. 
The Russian president says in this book that during his last 
visit to Poland he handed over to the Poles not only documents 
concerning the imposition of martial law, but also KGB files 
concerning Solidarity. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] In a book published in over 20 
countries over two weeks ago, the Russian president has written 
that in the documents that he passed on to Lech Walesa, Polish 
and Soviet Cheka officers spelled out the entire truth about 
Solidarity leaders: Sometimes it was frightening to read the 
documents; the KGB X-ray machine was so ruthless. I patted the 
file and said: Everything is here. Walesa went slightly pale, 
Boris Yeltsin says in his book. 
  The Sejm Constitutional Accountability Commission has asked 
the foreign affairs minister to obtain a copy of the book by the 
Russian president. 
  [Jerzy Wiatr, chairman of the Sejm commission] "We will see 
whether there is anything in Yeltsin's book that could be useful 
for the commission's work." 
  [Correspondent] Lech Walesa has given an assurance that he 
has not concealed any documents that were handed over to him by 
Boris Yeltsin. 
  [Walesa] "Most probably it is some misunderstanding, or 
there 
have been some leaks. I immediately passed on everything I had 
received. I think that the press had it earlier than the press 
spokesman. The documents were made available straight away." 
  [Correspondent] Vitaliy Pavlov, head of the KGB Warsaw 
station in the eighties, claims that the Russian president 
overdramatizes and excessively colors things that the KGB 
archives contained. 
  [Pavlov, in Russian with superimposed Polish translation] "I 
cannot imagine that any materials compromising Solidarity could 
have been included in the files handed over by Boris Yeltsin to 
Lech Walesa. They could have contained only our reports 
assessing the situation during the crisis in the eighties and 
reports by party apparatchicks who paid visits to Poland in 
those days." 
  [Correspondent, in Russian fading into Polish translation] 
"So, there are not any materials there that would not be known 
to the Ministry of Internal Affairs?" 
  [Pavlov] "I do not think so." 
  [Correspondent] Pavlov did not rule out, however, that the 
KGB center could have had in their possession some other 
materials obtained from the special services of other Communist 
countries, because such documents did not pass through his hands.

  [Text] Warsaw, 28 May -- Speaking today at the 3rd National 
Congress of the National Trade Union Alliance [OPZZ], Prime 
Minister Waldemar Pawlak described government activities as a 
long- range strategy of Poland's development. He added that 
Grzegorz Kolodko, the new deputy prime minister for economic 
affairs and finance minister, was a guarantor of this policy. 

    The prime minister said that concrete facts constituted the 
best information policy of his government, as opposed to paper 
facts such as conferences or press statements, which were past 
and gone very quickly. 
  In Pawlak's opinion, "protests are easier for the government 
to pass over, while matter-of-fact and serious negotiations are 
much more difficult." The prime minister stressed the role of 
the Tripartite Commission (government-employers-employees) in 
resolving disputes. He recalled that OPZZ deputies had 
contributed to the setting up of the commission. 
  Replying to censure of the government's indecision on the 
popiwek [excess wage tax], the prime minister admitted that his 
cabinet had been divided on the issue. "The issue of the popiwek 
has not been a matter of losing virginity, but a more complex 
one," the prime minister said, arguing that the new bill was not 
a "repetition of history." 
  In his speech, the prime minister also recalled decisions 
made by the government, including the third revalorization of 
old age and disability pensions this year, because -- as he put 
it -- we are not giving in to the atmosphere created by the 
media that we do not keep promises and have no program. The 
prime minister added that if economic processes developed in 
accordance with the government's expectations, there would be a 
further improvement in the situation of pensioners and public 
sector employees. 
  "I am glad that there will be no umbrella over our 
government; we shall have to be careful not to jump from the 
frying-pan into the fire," the prime minister said, commenting 
on an earlier statement by Ewa Spychalska, who announced that 
the OPZZ would not open a protective umbrella over this or any 
other government.

  [Text] Warsaw, 27 May -- According to the police, about 
10,000 Solidarity members and sympathizers assembled by 1330 
today in Warsaw's Pilsudski Square. However, new delegations 
arearriving constantly. At a press conference on Thursday, the 
organizers estimated that around 70,000 people will take part in 
the demonstration. 
  After a rally in Pilsudski Square, the demonstrators are to 
follow the Royal Route down to the office of the Council of 
Ministers. 
  The Solidarity demonstration is taking place under the 
slogan 
of the implementation of the union's eight demands, which 
include: abandonment of centralized wage controls, introduction 
of a 40-hour week, implementation of the enterprise pact, 
curtailment of energy price increases, and implementation of 
about 200 agreements signed between Solidarity and the 
government.

  [Text] Warsaw, 27 May -- Shortly after 1530, the head of 
Solidarity's national demonstration reached the office of the 
Council of Ministers in the center of Warsaw, as the last 
participants in the straggling march left Pilsudski Square. 
  The march was headed by a banner saying "Solidarity always 
in 
defense of your interests." The marchers chanted slogans, 
including: "Cimoszewicz must go," "SLD [Democratic Left 
Alliance] to Cuba," "An empty cell for Labor Minister Miller," 
and "Down with the commies." 
  In his speech at the rally preceding the march, Solidarity 
leader Marian Krzaklewski referred to the helicopter observing 
the preparations for the demonstration. He suggested that the 
government had already prepared a statement saying that the 
Solidarity demonstration had been a failure.

  [Text] Warsaw, 30 May -- According to Transport and 
Maritime Economic Minister Boguslaw Liberadzki "it is time to 
privatize our flagship carrier LOT." "We have 49 percent of its 
shares for sale," confirmed the minister, although he would not 
say to whom he wanted to sell the LOT shares. 
  "It does not have to be a strategic investor, nor does it 
have to be an airline company," noted Liberadzki. Asked by a 
PAP journalist whether American Airlines would be involved, the 
minister said LOT had concluded a strategic alliance with the 
American carrier and "that is enough for the moment." He added 
that during the latest conference of transport ministers in 
France he talked with the American secretary of transportation 
about "aviation and roads." 
  The minister denied that a two-year deadline for privatizing 
LOT (since its transformation into a State Treasury company) 
would expire in December this year, as "special legislation 
applies in this case." "First we have to establish the true 
value of LOT whose book value is 2.02 trillion zloty," he added.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Vladimir </F>
Mlynar; place and date not given: "With Vaclav Klaus About the 
Nation, Europe, and the Civic Democratic Party"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Mlynar] Two years ago, as 
you assumed the post of prime minister, you told RESPEKT that it 
is "too early to define Czech interests." How would you 
characterize Czech interests today? 
  [Klaus] If I recall correctly, I told you also that I am 
against essays that would force one to formulate elevated 
phrases while sitting in a closed study, and then attempt to 
squeeze reality into them. I would say again today that I 
cannot give you a simple definition of Czech interests. I would 
say: Take the last two volumes of my collected works, and you 
will find there what you are looking for in all its variety and 
scale. 
  The fundamental issue today is, I believe, to find our, to a 
certain degree lost, national identity, and not to immediately 
lose it again through entry into Europe. I keep telling our 
foreign guests that we do not want to dissolve in Europe like a 
piece of sugar in coffee. That is for me, at this time, the 
dominant issue, or if you wish, the Czech interest. 
<H5>  Eurorealist </H5>
  [Mlynar] What you say corresponds to your reputation of a 
Euroskeptic. That certainly is in many regards a prudential 
stand, nonetheless, there is a certain difference: if Norway, 
for instance -- which is firmly linked to the West and is a NATO 
member -- acts Euroskeptically, it does not risk anything. We 
are in danger, however, if we overdo the Euroskepticism, of 
another alternative: We could be left in the gray zone of 
"Inter-Europe," and in an even worse instance under a certain 
influence of the East. Do you see any other possibility for the 
Czech Republic but its integration into the European Union? 
  [Klaus] I am not aware of any other alternative, and, as a 
matter of fact, I also refuse the term Euroskepticism. 
Personally, I would rather subscribe to -- if labels are 
necessary -- to the term Eurorealism. I understand it as a 
stand that accepts the reality, attempts to live in it, and, at 
the same time, maximize the effect of it that we can enjoy. I 
disagree with the slogans currently fashionable in the West 
about the end of ideologies -- I do not believe that the 
discussions about the form of European integration are over. 
Far from it, we live in the process of constant redefinition of 
these concepts, and every change in Europe moves us somewhere 
else. Last year's failure of the European monetary system said 
something about the Maastricht vision of European currency, the 
Italian elections said something as they resulted in Foreign 
Minister Martino, who, as a conservative, cannot have the same 
opinion on the European integration as, for instance, the 
Belgian foreign minister. The European reality simply keeps 
changing. I take it into account, and react very sensitively so 
that this country benefits. 
  [Mlynar] Would it not be better for the Czech Republic to 
seek an alternative to entry into the European Union? A 
specific status similar to that of Switzerland has been 
mentioned occasionally in this context. 
  [Klaus] It has never been mentioned in my presence. 
Moreover, a specific status like that of Switzerland seems to 
me a bit too great an ambition. 
<H5>  The Unique Experience of Communism </H5>
  [Mlynar] How would you like the Czech Republic to look in 10 
years? 
  [Klaus] In 10 years the Czech Republic will be -- and I am 
not saying that this will not happen earlier -- a European 
country indistinguishable from those that have not experienced 
communism. I mean it politically, socially, and economically. 
That is my rather clear vision. 
  [Mlynar] You said recently that the "Western world of ideas 
is not exactly where" you would like it to be, and that the 
"Western European proclivity to the left will weigh on us." 
When you say that in 10 years we will be indistinguishable from 
our Western neighbors, is the "proclivity to the left" a part of 
it? 
  [Klaus] The Czech Republic has a chance -- within the 
historical period we are discussing -- to avoid this danger. We 
have experienced communism, and that makes us hypersensitive to 
certain things that the West does not feel so acutely. 
  [Mlynar] Nevertheless, when assessing the results of the 
Hungarian elections, you said that the reason for the victory of 
the left wing was that it has a feasible program, and that was 
more important for the voters than the experience of real 
communism. That certainly contradicts what you have just said 
now. 
  [Klaus] I would not say that there is a contradiction. I 
clearly differentiate in this context between the Czech and the 
Hungarian experiences. In Poland and Hungary they did not 
experience the 1960s as we did, nor did they experience the 
brutal destruction of all democratization processes. Thanks to 
this, a significant part of the Polish and Hungarian 
intelligentsia lived in the delusion of the possibility of 
revising the communist system from within. Moreover, a vast 
majority of my Polish friends and colleagues were not pushed to 
the edge of society in the 1970s and the 1980s as was the case 
in Czechoslovakia. During those two decades, they frequently 
sat down side by side with communist leaders in the incessant 
succession of reform groups. That led to Poland and Hungary 
having been more liberal in those 20 years than Czechoslovakia 
was at the time, but also to these people not keeping their 
distance from the communist regime. Therefore, even in the 
1970s and 1980s, the Polish and Hungarian economists were less 
radical than we were. I know it because I was in frequent 
contact with them. All this has been projected to a different 
view of the transformation process today, to the different 
political structures of the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary. 
<H5>  The Time for a Discussion About Joining the European Union </H5>
Is Only Coming 
  [Mlynar] As one of a few Czech politicians, you do not 
hesitate to use the word nation. What does this concept mean to 
you, and how does it agree with your liberal convictions? 
  [Klaus] You must concede that the liberal approach is not a 
limitless and false cosmopolitanism. Liberalism teaches that 
the point of departure is man, an individual, and that any human 
fusion should be based on immanent interests of man, and not on 
a doctrine imposed by force from without. In this respect, I 
believe that the term nation is a word of which we should not be 
ashamed. Although in the name of nation things happened in 
human history that were certainly not the best, I am convinced 
that many good things also happened in its name. Therefore I 
insist on the differentiation between the notions of nation and 
national, and the adjective nationalist. These are two 
completely different things. I claim that only large, and 
therefore indisputable, nations take the liberty of playing down 
the term national, and these nations are actually much more 
nationalist than we are. Those Czech intellectuals who put on 
cosmopolitan airs only think that talking about the nation is 
not good manners. 
  [Mlynar] Let us, in this context, go back to our joining the 
European structures. Why, do you think, are the consequences of 
such a step discussed so little? 
  [Klaus] The Czech public is only getting there, and that is 
in order. The discussions about the impact of joining the 
somewhat limiting European institutions still lie ahead of us, 
and I do not see any reason for getting to these discussions any 
faster. I am dealing with it almost incessantly because it 
interests me, but I do not believe that it is the main topic we 
must discuss today. The time must be ripe for it, just as it is 
now for the debate on the senate. To seriously discuss a topic 
means to read books about it, debate it with friends, and that 
cannot be speeded up. 
  [Mlynar] When do you think the time will be ripe for this 
debate? 
  [Klaus] I would say that in about two years this country 
will be ready to replace the slogan "return to Europe" with a 
discussion about what joining a certain institution means. 
<H5>  The Program for Every Day </H5>
  [Mlynar] For several months now, Josef Zieleniec, deputy 
chairman [of the Civic Democratic Party], has been talking about 
the need for preparing for the Civic Democratic Party a 
so-called program for every day that would formulate clearly and 
in detail the party policy on such matters as the housing 
market, education, health care privatization, and security. At 
the Civic Democratic Party congress in Koprivnice, you described 
this idea as nonsystemic. How do you feel about it today? 
  [Klaus] The idea of the program for every day died in 
principle. I declare with all responsibility that since the 
Koprivnice congress, I have not encountered anyone, anywhere, 
who would want to revive it. I believe that it was just a 
momentary idea. 
  I certainly do not have anything against the need for a 
constant rationalization of the political party program, but I 
do not feel it necessary to do this rationalization with a 
capital R precisely now. I take it as a permanent process, and 
if you read the articles that I write for LIDOVE NOVINY, for 
instance, you know that the Civic Democratic Party program 
theses are cerebrated there and expanded ad infinitum the way I 
see them. 
  [Mlynar] Your articles in LIDOVE NOVINY represent, however, 
the stand of the prime minister, or possibly of the Civic 
Democratic Party chairman, and not that of the party. 
  [Klaus] That is not the issue. It is a part of the 
permanent dialogue that we conduct incessantly and at all 
possible levels of the Civic Democratic Party. Right now, for 
instance, we are in the process of preparing the election 
program for the local elections and we hold broad discussions 
about its individual chapters -- that is the constant 
reflection, of which my articles are also a part. That is the 
reality. It seems to me that the debate in the media on the 
program for every day was somewhat exaggerated, that it was an 
attempt at finding some controversy within the Civic Democratic 
Party that does not exist. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with President Vaclav Havel by correspondent Eva </F>
Hulkova at the Lany presidential residence; date not given; from 
the "Conversations at Lany" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Hulkova] At a news conference in the Forum 
Hotel, which was attended by many journalists, you said that on 
principle the Czech side will not comment on the election 
contest in Slovakia. [passage omitted] 
  [Havel] A process of shaping views, political shaping is 
under way there. It is a new phase of shaping democracy in 
Slovakia. It is very important that we are aware of all this. 
  However, at the same time, we should be very careful when 
commenting on individual political entities. The fact that the 
standard norm among states is not to intervene in others' 
internal affairs is one reason for us to observe this. The 
other reason is that both sides, and especially the Slovak side, 
are still very sensitive. It is difficult to guess what 
intention, be it even a good intention, might produce opposite 
results--whether a statement in support of someone will not be 
used by someone else against the person in whose support the 
statement was made. The current situation in Slovakia, 
especially in the pre-election period, simply demands certain 
restraint, certain caution, and calls for work on specific 
issues. 
  At the same time, no scope should be given for turning any 
Czech step, or any step taken by a Slovak official concerning 
the Czech side, into something that causes an emotive playing of 
the so-called Czech card on the Slovak internal political scene. 
  I would like to add that my meeting with President Michal 
Kovac concentrated on the theme of spiritual, cultural 
coexistence. [passage omitted] 
  During my talks on coexistence I came across interesting 
phenomena. On one side Slovakia has achieved its own statehood 
and many citizens have begun to feel part of that community. 
Regardless of their previous support or lack of support for 
Slovakia's independence, nowadays they perceive Slovakia as 
their own state. They have begun to feel proud of their state. 
This of course is all right. However, at the same time, they 
seem to miss something they were used to, something as natural 
for them as breathing--that is the common Czech-Slovak spiritual 
dimension. [passage omitted] 
  An interesting thing is that this loss is paradoxically felt 
more intensively in Slovakia than in the Czech Lands--this a bit 
of a paradox given the fact that it was above all Slovakia that 
expressed the desire to have its own state. This situation is 
as it is because our relationship has always been a bit 
asymmetric, as if Slovakia was more used to receiving impulses 
from Bohemia than the Czech Lands receiving them from Slovakia. 
[passage omitted] 
  However, I think that it is also in our interest not to 
allow 
links to be severed that do not need to be, and whose severance 
will be damaging to us, in fact. [passage omitted] 
  [Hulkova] Let us take a look at one, I would say, highly 
contentious moment in your work, at least in terms of the 
reaction. You signed a document that put a definitive seal on 
the restitution of property to physical Jewish persons. It 
aroused a very lively array of rather negative reactions. So 
what do you think about it? 
  [Havel] [passage omitted] Citizens of Jewish belief or 
nationality had their property confiscated during the war by a 
law derived from the Nuremberg laws. In addition, other 
property was also seized, but this was usually done by executive 
means and such cases were more a minority. After the war, 
President Edvard Benes issued a decree from which there later 
stemmed legislation rectifying injustices concerning property. 
It is stated in the original decree that property must be 
returned to people persecuted because of their race, 
nationality, or politics. This amendment applies to restitution 
of property solely to those people who were persecuted for 
reasons of race. This is because on account of the Communist 
coup in 1948 it proved impossible to realize. Even though 
claims were laid, they were never finally met. 
  Objections to this law referred to the fact that the law 
applies only to people persecuted for reasons of race and not 
those others who were persecuted for reasons of nationality or 
politics. I would naturally also prefer it if the law applied 
to all groups of people referred to in the original Benes 
decree. It would be cleaner. Nevertheless, there is no reason 
why a law should not be ratified that refers to only one group 
of these people. The fact that it uses the expression that they 
were persecuted for racial reasons is entirely unavoidable 
because that is how this group was defined even in the original 
Benes decree, in spite of the fact that there were other groups 
in addition. If we wish to rectify this injustice, we must use 
this definition again. This group was by far the worst 
affected. The use of the word racial does not constitute 
introducing any kind of racial criteria into the law, but it is 
not possible to rectify injustice inflicted on somebody without 
using the same term, whereby that person was defined when the 
injustice was committed. In other words, there was no reason of 
principle nor any moral or constitutional reason for not 
ratifying such a law, the more so given that if I had not 
ratified it and returned it to parliament it is questionable 
whether it will ever have been passed a second time. 
  Let us go to a more general question now. As it is known, we 
do not have a Senate. One of the Senate's tasks is to monitor 
the work of the Chamber of Deputies and act as a safety net 
should some laws not be very good. [passage omitted] 
  Because we do not have a Senate, many expect the president 
to 
play the Senate's role, they expect the president will somehow 
improve the laws or propose various changes in the laws. 
  There are always some who frequently criticize the laws I 
sign. They reproach me for signing them. But this boils down to 
the fact that these people do not understand the essence of the 
right of veto. [passage omitted] 
  The president's task is not to veto laws just because he 
dislikes this or that in them. Although, in this particular law 
there are things I quite dislike, it is not a good enough reason 
for me to return the law. Thus, the president cannot be 
continually required to play the Senate's role. The parliament 
will have to make a decision whether or not we should have the 
Senate and on ways of electing the Senate. But it is impossible 
to have the Senate equipped with certain powers written in the 
Constitution, and yet to fail to form the Senate and, at the 
same time, to unwittingly expect that its powers should be 
executed by some other constitutional institution. 
  [Hulkova] Your claim that you are going to veto the laws 
only 
if they seriously fail to meet your ideas seems to me to be a 
bit of an excuse because the legislators in this country do not 
greatly differ from you and will not create something where 
there will be a chance of you absolutely disagreeing with it. I 
fear that (?given this context) you will never use the right of 
veto. 
  [Havel] I will use it. I have already done so on one 
occasion. Other situations when I will use it will undoubtedly 
arise. But to a certain extent these will always be exceptional 
situations. That is how I understand this Constitution and that 
is how things should be, I think. [passage omitted] 
  [Hulkova] Do you really think it is bad that since there is 
no Senate, you are expected to play a certain role that will 
temporarily replace the Senate, as it were? Is this such a bad 
situation? 
  [Havel] I think it is. The roles of individual 
constitutional institutions should be clearly defined, they 
should be indisputable, and should not be confused. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Hulkova] So we have returned to the topic of the Senate and 
I reckon we could launch another edition of Conversations from 
Lany. 
  [Havel] [passage omitted] There is one thing I would like to 
say about this topic, though. I think that to maintain the 
present state of affairs is untenable from the long-term 
viewpoint. This means that on the one hand, the Senate has been 
written into the Constitution, and yet we do not actually have 
one. There are yet other consequences of this state of affairs. 
At the time when the Chamber of Deputies is dissolved, it is 
the Senate that takes over its work. Since we do not have the 
Senate, it appears there is no one to take over the role of the 
parliament if it is dissolved and that is why the final clauses 
of our Constitution say that our Chamber of Deputies cannot be 
disbanded. 
  But this state of affairs is unthinkable in democracy. It 
means we lack one of the basic instruments for solving possible 
political crises. [passage omitted] 
  That is why I think that the present, very turbulent climate 
surrounding the issue of the Senate in political circles is a 
genuinely important factor for this country. At first glance it 
appears that citizens are not interested in it, that it does not 
concern them, and that they are not experiencing it as a burning 
issue of paramount importance. I absolutely understand it. But 
the consequences of it could very seriously affect society 
later. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prague -- President Vaclav Havel wants to stay in 
more frequent working contact with the government and, 
therefore, he will attend more of its meetings. "I have come to 
the conclusion that it will be useful for the two sides if I 
change slightly the method of my contacts with the government as 
a whole, with the individual ministers, and with the prime 
minister. I think that it is in the interest of our state's 
stability for these contacts to be matter- of-fact and 
frequent," said the president as he was leaving yesterday's 
cabinet session, which he attended for about 70 minutes. 
  The government expressed its agreement yesterday with the 
president's visit to Slovakia, which is scheduled for 26 May. 
"The government did not give me any tasks, but, of course, I 
will receive background materials from the Foreign Ministry as I 
do for all my foreign visits," said Havel in connection with his 
visit to Slovakia. 
  The government also agreed with the president's 
participation 
in the celebrations to be held at the beginning of June to mark 
the 50th anniversary of the allied landings in France.

"Czech Trade and the GATT Uruguay Round"] 
  [Text]The Czech Republic is a country with an 
economic potential that has always been and certainly also will 
be greater than the absorption ability of the domestic market. 
If we want to achieve an economic growth that makes use of 
production capacity to the utmost, the ability of our 
enterprises to gain access to other markets and export is of 
principal importance. At the same time, our economy is facing 
major restructuring and modernization, which means a demand for 
investment in quality technology, currently mostly from imports. 
The participation of the Czech economy in international trade 
is, however, of almost decisive significance for future economic 
growth. That is, above all, why we welcomed the conclusion to 
the GATT Uruguay Round. 
  The Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks certainly was 
the most universal negotiation process in the history of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). A total of 125 
countries, which are responsible for more than 90 percent of 
world trade, took part in the Uruguay Round. The much wider and 
more active participation of the developing countries and 
countries in transition from central planning to a market 
economy, which assumed very respectable undertakings in all 
spheres discussed, was a completely new phenomenon. 
<H5>  Results of Multilateral Talks </H5>
  The universal nature of the Uruguay Round is evidenced by 
the 
expansion of the previous framework of multilaterally regulated 
spheres of trade by new sectors of international trade -- e.g., 
services, intellectual property rights -- and those spheres of 
trade that for decades have remained outside the GATT system 
(agriculture, textiles). The uniqueness of the Uruguay Round 
lies in the fact that all the participating countries had to 
accept practically all its results in the form of a so-called 
single undertaking. In this the Uruguay Round differs 
fundamentally from all previous rounds of multilateral trade 
talks. The principle of a single undertaking was projected to 
an obligation on the part of all participants in the talks to 
contribute with their work to the general liberalization of 
world trade and concurrently subordinate the development of 
their trade political systems to the agreed regulations and 
discipline. 
  The results of the Uruguay Round can be divided into three 
basic planes. The first level is the achieved degree of 
liberalization of world trade resting on the average 40-percent 
reduction of the import duty on industrial goods, the transfer 
of all non-tariff obstacles implemented by agricultural products 
to customs and their subsequent reduction (together with the 
customs presently in effect) by 36 percent on average. At the 
same time, the predictability of the trade political systems 
increases, as most of the participants of the round took on the 
obligation not to raise import duties without discussion with 
the partners beforehand (the so-called consolidation). These 
reductions of customs protection do not, however, affect all 
industrial and agricultural spheres with the same intensity. In 
some traditionally sensitive sectors, like textiles and garment 
or footwear production, for instance, the degree of 
liberalization is lower than the overall average. 
  On the other hand, in many other sectors, the Round 
participants from the most advanced countries agreed on the 
complete removal of import duties or harmonization of them at a 
low level. They include construction, agricultural, and medical 
equipment, steel, beer, paper, toys, furniture, pharmaceuticals, 
and chemical products. With some other categories of goods, the 
liberalization undertaking was assumed by only a small number of 
the most advanced partners; that applies to scientific 
equipment, for instance, nonferrous metals, wood, electronics, 
fish products, and other types of goods. The customs reduction 
will be implemented gradually over a period of four to 10 years 
(by industrial products) and six years (by agricultural 
products). Hence, we will enjoy the effect of the 
liberalization already in the 1990s, and completely in the next 
century. 
  A part of the Uruguay Round is the General Agreement on 
Trade 
in Services (GATS), which, for the first time in the history of 
world trade, multilaterally defines the basic rules and 
responsibilities in the trade in services. In addition to the 
general principles similar to those applied to trade in goods 
(most-favored-nation clause, protective measures), the Round 
participants accepted initial obligations to open their markets 
and offer national treatment to foreign services and their 
suppliers. These obligations are included in the so-called 
national principal, and regulate the imports regime in the 
individual branches of services. 
  This section of the outcome of the Uruguay Round is 
apparently the most important one for the Czech exporters, 
because it gives them better access to markets. We are a 
country with important short-term comparative advantages, and 
that is why precisely the improved access to markets is 
beneficial to us. This is the basis for the claim that the 
Czech Republic is one of the countries that are in a position to 
benefit most from the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. 
  The second plane concerns the considerable reinforcement of 
the multilateral framework of the regulations for international 
trade that was obtained by perfecting the existing GATT text, by 
a revision and improvement of the existing specific conventions 
and agreements on antidumping, subsidies, protection, and many 
other spheres, and, last but not least, by expanding the GATT 
powers to new spheres of international trade (services, 
investment, intellectual property protection). 
  Czech businessmen are also well aware of instances when 
technical obstacles to trade, sanitary and phytosanitary 
regulations, customs and other procedures may be abused and lead 
to protectionist practices and a decline in exports of Czech 
goods. The objective of the agreed regulations is therefore to 
prevent a misuse of these measures for other purposes than those 
generally sanctioned. 
  The third level has to do with a breakthrough of an 
institutional character, which should result in the 
establishment of the third pillar of the Bretton Woods system -- 
in addition to the World Bank and IMF, the World Trade 
Organization (WTO). That organization will become the universal 
forum for solving all trade- policy problems, the legal 
regulation of which is enshrined in the outcome of the Uruguay 
Round. Thus, the WTO will replace the previous rounds of 
multilateral trade talks and will render this liberalization 
process a permanent phenomenon. 
  An integral part of the new institutional framework, one 
that 
will lead to its having greater legal power, will be the 
so-called integrated system of settling disputes. The integral 
role of the new system consists of the right of each member of 
the WTO to indicate any point of contention in the trade-policy 
practices of its partners that it believes to be in conflict 
with assumed obligations. The integrated system of settling 
disputes is a tool that makes it possible to better and more 
effectively protect the interests and rights of the smaller WTO 
members in particular. 
<H5>  The Ratification Process Will Not Be Simple </H5>
  The results of the Uruguay Round are not a panacea, and in 
themselves will not lead to the settlement of all problems of 
world trade. Nevertheless, the WTO can be considered a very 
promising guarantee of an effective removal or at least 
amelioration of the protectionist pressures and tendencies 
towards controlled trade and unilateral measures. In many 
areas, the fundamental objective was reached of launching the 
integration of certain sectors that have stood outside the GATT 
multilateral regulation framework so far. 
  In agriculture and textile trade, the parties to the General 
Agreement are only at the first stage on the road. The 
obligation to reduce domestic assistance and exports subsidies, 
for instance, will not a priori remove all the deformations 
resulting from the very existence of the subsidy policy, which 
often demonstrate themselves on world markets. This applies 
also to textiles, where the full integration and multilateral 
frameworks can in fact be expected only in 10 years. Hence, the 
next decade will still be "burdened" by the previous trade 
regulations. 
  In many countries, the signatures of ministers on the 
document in Marrakesh only start the ratification process, at 
the end of which, most of the participants of the Uruguay Round 
should become the founding members of the WTO. At this time, it 
is necessary that the governments of all participating countries 
submit the agreed results to their appropriate national 
authorities. It depends on the speed of the ratification 
procedures how long it will take before the results of the 
Uruguay Round take effect. The date frequently mentioned in 
this context is 1 May 1995. Only the Implementation Conference, 
however, which is to take place at the end of the year, will 
determine how feasible this date is. 
<H5>  Benefits for the Czech Republic </H5>
  The successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round must be seen 
as a mosaic of partial national assessments of this process. It 
is a demanding task to express the results of the Uruguay Round 
in numbers, one with set natural limits based on the restricted 
possibility of extrapolating the hitherto development and 
predicting the extent of the effect of the unprecedented opening 
of markets on the economic growth, trade, and employment, and 
the extent to which it will lead to necessary structural changes 
in the world economy. These observation apply doubly to the 
Czech Republic in its dynamic process of changes. 
  It can be expected that at the turn of the millennium, the 
improved access for the Czech exporters to foreign markets could 
lead to an additional growth in the Czech Republic's GDP of 1.5 
to 2 percent. This estimate is based on the model prepared by 
the OECD Secretariat, according to which the net global effect 
of the Uruguay Round for all its participants should amount to 
more that $270 billion. The real benefit resulting from 
improved access to foreign markets could mean, on the basis of 
the extrapolated contemporaneous data, an increase in Czech 
exports in 2005 of approximately 1.5 billion korunas (assuming 
the current exchange rate does not change). This data is based 
on the expectation by the GATT Secretariat of an approximately 
12-percent growth in international trade by the end of the 
aforementioned year 2005. 
  The weighted average of the customs burden for the Czech 
exporters of industrial goods will decline most in exports to 
New Zealand (by 57 percent), Canada (45 percent), and the United 
States (37 percent). The decline of the weighted average of the 
customs burden for the Czech integration partners (EU, EFTA, and 
CEFTA countries) is only a hypothetical quantity merely 
indicating the extent of the setback in the preferential margin 
that the Czechs obtained by the signature and gradual 
implementation of these agreements. After all, thanks to 
bilateral arrangements regarding the creation of free trade 
zones, the Czech reciprocal trade with the EU, EFTA, and other 
integration partners is, or soon will be, completely 
liberalized. The improved access to the market comes about also 
in many developing countries. 
  In the OECD member countries, which are the traditional 
target of Czech exports, the protection will be reduced most 
significantly by metals (62 percent), products made of wood and 
paper (57 percent), machines and equipment (approximately 50 
percent), and by chemical products (43 percent). A lower than 
average reduction of the custom tariffs will be recorded by 
transport equipment (22 percent), fish and fish products (21 
percent), and the least reduction will be introduced to textile, 
garment products, footwear, and leather (approximately 20 
percent). 
  In its turn, the Czech Republic will reduce its customs on 
industrial goods by 22 percent. It is necessary to emphasize in 
this context that the Czech import duty on industrial goods is 
already among the lowest in GATT, and therefore the Uruguay 
Round participants accepted a smaller reduction than the rate 
agreed. The rate of reduction of the Czech customs tariffs 
moves between 18 and 25 percent for most industrial goods. The 
Czech Republic also joined the liberalization initiatives in the 
sphere of chemical products, pharmaceuticals, fish and fish 
products. It spread the reduction over 10 years in the first 
two categories, and this also applies to the generally sensitive 
textile and garment products. 
  In agriculture, the achieved degree of liberalization will 
be 
reflected on Czech relations with all countries not excepting 
even the preferential partners. Moreover, the Czech negotiators 
obtained in bilateral talks a number of valuable concessions in 
such traditional or sensitive export commodities as malt, hops, 
and cheeses. On the other hand, the Czech Republic submitted a 
valuable list of concessions in agriculture, which puts it among 
the countries whose customs and trade-policy regime is 
considered predictable and transparent. In the process, 
however, the appropriate customs protection for the most 
sensitive agricultural products has been established. It can 
also be considered favorable that the assumed obligations 
regarding domestic subsidies and exports support do not require 
in the case of the Czech Republic any reduction of the subsidies 
provided in the past years. On the contrary, the resulting 
amounts offer sufficient room for the creation of a realistic 
agricultural policy. 
<H5>  The Problems of Minimum Work Standards </H5>
  The work agenda of the new World Trade Organization became a 
topic of lively discussions already during the Marrakesh talks. 
The most controversial issue apparently is the revival on the 
part of the United States and some EU countries of efforts to 
link the problems of the so-called working standard with the 
issues of multilateral trade policy. At first sight, the 
connection seems logical: In countries where it is possible 
from the political point of view goods can be manufactured and 
exported at a "disproportionately" low cost -- using convict and 
forced labor, child labor, longer than average hours, violating 
basic labor safety rules, low wages, or a combination of these. 
In fact, however, the logic is lacking. The problem of 
convict, forced, and child labor should be dealt with, above 
all, by other institutions (particularly the International Labor 
Organization) and only in some aspects might the WTO have to 
accept some steps within the framework of its agenda. We will 
reject attempts to include these problems in the WTO agenda in 
all other instances. For several decades now, for instance, 
experts have many times been trying to define various wage 
concepts: appropriate, fair, substandard, nonstandard, etc. 
None of these concepts has been accepted, or can be accepted, 
because each is open to abuse by an accusation of dumping. Most 
of these accusations are simply false for they are used against 
the countries where the cost of wages is lower because of the 
temporary comparative advantages (one reason is also that the 
population of these countries does not enjoy the excessively 
broad social advantages that are enjoyed in the advanced 
countries). The same argumentation applies to the length of 
working time, labor safety, etc. 
  The argumentation is, however, myopic also from the vantage 
point of the advanced countries. The imposition of minimum 
working standards on the developing countries will not reduce 
their comparative advantages (as competitors in the advanced 
countries hope) because the cost of wages is only a part of the 
total cost. For the same reason, employment in the importing 
countries will not increase, as is sometimes argued in the EU 
countries. Wages in the less advanced countries will remain low 
as long as these countries are poor, and there is not a supply 
surplus. The claim is hypocritical that the arguments on 
minimum working standards also have a humanitarian framework. 
On the contrary, the poorer and less advanced countries can 
gradually grow rich only if they gain access to the markets of 
the advanced countries and are able to export more. 
  It is apparent that the Czech exporters are potentially 
threatened by the abuse of the working standards in 
international trade. We admit that these are very broad and 
sensitive problems. Nevertheless, the Czech Republic will 
closely follow the progress of the discussion on these issues. 
In the creation of rules in new areas, the Czech Republic will 
take a firm stand against any conceivable abuse of these 
initiatives that would result in a reinforcement of the 
protectionist tendencies in international trade and an attempt 
at a reduction or even a removal of natural comparative 
advantages of the participants in international trade, including 
the Czech Republic. 
  For those active in international trade, the Uruguay Round 
has opened the gates of the next century. It has revealed, much 
more clearly than any of the previous ones, the possibilities of 
how the liberalization of trade in all its forms and spheres can 
contribute to the growth of the world economy. The generation 
of stricter and better rules, according to which international 
trade will develop, can already now be described with certainty 
as the greatest contribution for the Czech Republic, but also 
for other lesser Uruguay Round participants with a high degree 
of involvement in the world economy. Without the appropriate 
legal framework, even the best concessions in access to the 
market would soon lose a lot of their attractiveness and corrode 
under the pressure of often very refined protectionism. 
Therefore, we consider the improvement of the existing 
principles and regulations of the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade, and the emergence of the new World Trade Organization 
as favorable steps towards increasing the overall predictability 
of developments in the world economy and, at the same time, a 
significant guarantee for our own economic growth.

  [Text] The European Commission began another antidumping 
procedure against importers from the Czech Republic. This time 
the procedure concerns foundry pig iron. 
  Relevant bodies of the Czech Foreign Ministry have not yet 
received any official notification about the procedure. The 
Czech Republic's permanent mission at the European Union 
immediately protested against the Commission's one-sided 
approach, asked for information necessary to discuss specific 
trade instances, and said that the aim was to find a solution 
acceptable to both sides. 
  This is only the third instance of anti-dumping procedure 
against Czech importers since 1991. However, over the last 
two-months period this is the second instance following 
accusations levelled against Czech exporters of cement.

<F P=106> ["km"-signed report: "Experts See a Greater Risk in the </F>
Former USSR Than in Bosnia"] 
  [Text] If there is any external threat to the Czech 
Republic, then it is, above all, the developments in the former 
Soviet Union. The International Relations Institute experts, who 
prepared the documentation for the government concept of 
security policy, believe that even the present conflict in 
former Yugoslavia is less dangerous for the Czech Republic than 
the ethnic, political, and economic conflicts in the post-Soviet 
countries. 
  According to the document, which the government experts used 
when drafting the security concept, the most perilous disputes 
in Europe are the Polish-Russian, possibly Polish-Ukrainian, 
Polish- Lithuanian, and Russian-Baltic conflicts. 
  In the context of the war in former Yugoslavia, the Czech 
experts point out particularly the possibility of the 
penetration of militant Islamic fundamentalism into Europe. 
Another security hazard in Central Europe could be the 
nationalist attempts at revision of the borders and the 
so-called disputable territory -- Greater Germany, Greater 
Hungary.

  [Text] An aircraft carrying 90 members of the 92d infantry 
regiment of the French Army from Clermont-Ferrand landed at the 
Kladne airport near Ceske Budejovice this afternoon. Another 40 
French soldiers arrived at Boletice military training ground in 
Cesky Krumlov district shortly after midnight. Until 10 June 
they will be training in Boletice together with 120 members of 
the second company of the 23d Mechanized Battalion of the Czech 
Army, which is based in Strasice in Rokycany district. 
  This is the Czech Army's first major contact with the West 
within the context of the Partnership for Peace initiative, 
during the course of which soldiers of a NATO member country 
will be for the first time training with their own weapons on 
the Czech Republic's territory.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Antonin Baudys by Jiri </F>
Kouda; place and date not given: "If You Are Traveling, You Must 
Pay the Toll"] 
  [Excerpts] [Kouda] The prime minister signed the 
Partnership for Peace recently. In your opinion, this is merely 
the way to full membership in NATO. Is that opinion shared by 
all the coalition partners? 
  [Baudys] I admit that I have not encountered any other 
opinion among the other partners. 
  [Kouda] Does that not mean, however, taking responsibility 
-- to a certain extent -- for NATO even in possible situations 
when it is not in the Czech Republic's interest? 
  [Baudys] When you enter into a marriage with someone, you 
must know with whom you are entering into it, that is, whether 
this is a reliable person. Understandably, it does not only 
mean a number of advantages, but also a number of 
responsibilities and sui generis certain restrictions. It is 
impossible to be a fare-dodger on a train. Simply, if you are 
traveling, you must pay the toll. 
  [Kouda] Many opposition politicians are cautious about 
joining NATO, many are opposed to it. In this context, they 
often emphasize the role of the CSCE. Moreover, there is also 
Russia here with its negative position toward NATO expansion so 
that a new cordon sanitaire is not created around that power. 
  [Baudys] It is necessary to realize that the CSCE is a forum 
for negotiation. It is not an executive body that has executive 
powers and repressive elements. It is completely different from 
NATO or the Western European Union. Every responsible 
politician, and especially the defense or foreign minister, must 
do all he can to ensure that this country functions. We know 
that situations may arise that could exceed this country's 
defense capability. It is necessary to look for bodies of 
collective security. History leads to a certain general 
integration -- communication and technological -- and NATO is 
also one of the levels of integration. 
  [Kouda] And what is your view of a power like Russia? 
  [Baudys] Of course, Russia is not only a power, it is a 
superpower. That is one thing. The other is that each state 
must seek its own identity, a place where it belongs. This 
government team, which won the most support in the elections, 
has come up with a program according to which the Czech Republic 
is part of European and Western European civilization. It 
belongs to and acknowledges the values of the European Union; it 
acknowledges the values that NATO defends. As far as Russia is 
concerned, it is up to it alone where it stands and what it 
avows. 
  [Kouda] Would it not be appropriate, however, to confirm 
this orientation in a referendum? That is, by asking whether 
citizens want the Czech Republic to join NATO? 
  [Baudys] Several principles are being mixed up here. A 
referendum is normal in democracies of the kind found in 
Switzerland, where they are conducted even on a local level 
about something important. A referendum is a different way of 
pursuing democracy than is normal in our country. There is a 
historically well-established method here -- electing political 
parties. Each party produces a specific program and we as 
coalition parties have never made a secret of our attitude 
toward NATO. The voters accepted this, these parties were 
elected by the majority, this is part of the government's 
program, and parliament has approved this program. I see no 
reason to hold a referendum on this. I would ask, if not NATO 
or the Western European Union, then what? No opposition 
politician has been able to answer this question yet. No one 
has been able to propose an alternative that would make any 
sense. [passage omitted] 
  [Kouda] According to General Nekvasil, there should be 
33,000 professional soldiers in the Army. This number has now 
declined, however, and this situation is being reflected mainly 
among the posts of squad, platoon, and company commanders. How 
do you intend to deal with it? 
  [Baudys] The Army's transformation is oriented toward 
ensuring that it is compatible with other armies from advanced 
democratic states, mostly NATO members, by means of its ability, 
structure, and organization. Reducing the size of the Army is 
one thing, transferring from a division to a brigade system is 
another, and the method of command and management is something 
else again. Other things include the personnel issue, the 
education and training system in the Army, the whole principle 
of budgeting and planning, democratic management, and creating a 
comprehensive new and functioning logistical system. These are 
processes that were started in the middle of last year, 
processes that take place at a specific time and according to a 
timetable. In reply to your question: By significantly 
reducing the number of most senior officers and transferring 
them to command the lower-level units -- squads, companies, and 
so on. 
  [Kouda] Do you think that the officers will transfer to 
these posts? 
  [Baudys] The process will take some time. Of course, it 
will be difficult for a 50-year-old officer to command a platoon 
or a company. That is not the purpose. It will lead to natural 
waste in the Army; people will retire. A number of people no 
longer want to be in the Army, mainly for financial reasons. 
Dozens, however, are returning to it again. Filling the 
lower-level posts could not be done last year, for it was not 
clear which units would be abolished, whether people would get 
an apartment, and so on. Consequently, we could not offer them 
any prospects. Now this is under way, we have a concept, and 
only now are we recruiting for the Army. 
  [Kouda] The across-the-board screenings have, obviously, not 
fulfilled their purpose. 
  [Baudys] That was not understood properly. It was 
constantly pressed upon me that the screenings mean a sweeping 
purge. We needed to map out the situation, that is, who is who 
and take action against the most flagrant cases. I had 
anticipated that we would be able to take action against more of 
these cases; we simply did not succeed 100 percent, but 
fundamental changes are in progress. [passage omitted] 
  [Kouda] You have admitted that smallpox cultures were stored 
in the military hospital in Stresovice. How and when were the 
cultures destroyed and who bears, or will bear, the 
responsibility for storing them? 
  [Baudys] Those are problems that have been foisted upon us. 
So far, no investigation has shown that the Czech Army preserved 
anything that would be at variance with the law or at variance 
with international conventions. I had the viral cultures 
destroyed because it was apparent from the conclusion reached by 
the inter-departmental commission that there was no need to 
continue to store them. That entire issue has been unbelievably 
blown up and overdramatized. 
  [Kouda] As defense minister, you made the decision to 
destroy the smallpox virus. So, the Czech Army had preserved it 
for a certain period. 
  [Baudys] That was not at variance with any international 
convention, however. If I had not given the order for its 
destruction, nothing would have happened. It is also necessary 
to say that the issue here involves the variola minor and 
variola major forms of smallpox. The variola major was 
destroyed in 1975. What the Czech Army had was variola minor, 
which is less dangerous than variola major. A number of very 
dangerous viruses -- which you can purchase for a few dollars in 
any laboratory, however -- were preserved. The issue was blown 
out of proportion.

<F P=106> ["(kp)"-signed report: "Baudys Ordered the Screening of </F>
Soldiers With Slovak Relatives"] 
  [Text] Prague -- Defense Minister Antonin Baudys 
(Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party) wanted 
to verify the reliability of the people working in the Defense 
Ministry and the Czech Army who have family or other ties with 
foreign nationals, including Slovaks, according to RUDE PRAVO's 
information. On 10 November 1993, Baudys set the chief of the 
General Staff the task of guaranteeing the protection of 
official secrets within the Defense Ministry with reference to 
foreign nationals or foreign organizations operating in the 
Defense Ministry and the Czech Army. The order states 
literally: "It is necessary to assess the suitability of 
engaging in their current positions those persons employed or 
serving in the Defense Ministry who are acquainted with official 
secrets and who have family or other active ties with foreign 
nationals, including the Slovak Republic." In particular, the 
aforementioned suitability should have been assessed with regard 
to complying with the purpose of the stipulations contained in 
the Law on Protecting State Secrets and with the government's 
regulations on protecting economic and official secrets. The 
completion date was 31 December 1993. Apart from this, Baudys 
also set the following task: "In the interest of protecting the 
Defense Ministry's activity, it is necessary to notify Military 
Defense Intelligence of persons whose spouse is a foreign 
national or has permanent residence outside the Czech Republic 
or who has active ties with foreign nationals." 
  Five days later -- that is, on 15 November 1993 -- the 
defense minister issued new instructions in connection with this 
order, instructions that contain far more general and moderate 
formulations, but do not contain the two aforementioned passages.

<F P=106> [Report by Jiri Kubik: "The Privatization Ministry Has Paid </F>
Out Millions Wrongly"] 
  [Text] Prague -- According to Supreme Inspection Office 
[NKU] findings, the Ministry for the Administration and 
Privatization of National Property used money from the state 
budget and the state funds improvidently -- amounting to 71.7 
million korunas [Kc]. For example, according to the Inspection 
Office, it paid its U.S. advisers in a manner at variance with 
its regulations and, despite its directives, it paid bonuses to 
its staff. Embezzlement is not involved, however. 
  Zdenek Smelik, a member of the inspection unit that 
supervised the inspection at the Ministry, described these 
shortcomings as a failure to comply fully with the regulations 
and administrative obligations. On the other hand, Lubomir 
Netolicky, the head of the Ministry's Office, said that he 
considers the proceedings instituted by the NKU to be the 
mechanical application of generally binding legal regulations 
and the one-sided interpretation of the stipulations of certain 
laws. 
  The NKU report described as the biggest mistake the fact 
that 
the Ministry used more than Kc0.5 million from the National 
Property Fund. The fund's Presidium had transferred the money 
to the Privatization Ministry in the years 1991-93, despite the 
fact that the law does not permit such transactions. 
  According to the Inspection Office, the Ministry paid its 80 
staff a total of Kc700,000 in the form of personal bonuses from 
the funds that the government had allocated to Skalicky's 
ministry. "A personal bonus should be paid from this money to 
the 16 members of staff who are entrusted with the most 
demanding tasks, who compile and evaluate the materials, and who 
achieve excellent results," said Smelik. By using the money for 
a different purpose, the Ministry has violated the decree on 
managing resources from the state budget. Netolicky said, 
however, that the details about assigning the money for 16 
members of staff had been laid down only tentatively.

<F P=106> ["(km)"-signed report: "Viktorie Hradska Will Head the Arms </F>
Consortium as of June"] 
  [Text] Prague -- Viktorie Hradska, the former diplomat and 
leader of the defunct Liberal Democratic Party, will become the 
new director of the RDP Group arms consortium as of 1 June. She 
will take over the most senior post in this consortium, which 
affiliates more than 40 companies, from current Director Jan 
Vlcek. 
  The change in the company's management came about after 
Vlcek 
was criticized for the difficulties in communicating with the 
Defense Ministry, without which the RDP Group's arms plans will 
not succeed. 
  "I am resigning so that cooperation with the Army can be 
improved," admitted Vlcek. At the same time, however, he added 
that he will carry on as a member of the RDP Group shareholding 
company's board. 
  In 1992, Hradska was deputy chairwoman of the government's 
Committee for International Relations. She led the Liberal 
Democratic Party until March 1992. She then transferred with 
her wing of the party to the Civic Democratic Alliance. She was 
also recently a serious candidate for the post of ambassador to 
Hungary. According to representatives from the RDP Group, her 
qualification for the post of director is her ability to conduct 
negotiations.

  [Text] The Republic of Croatia has requested that the 
situation in the occupied territories of the Republic of Croatia 
be added to the agenda of the 49th session of the UN General 
Assembly on 13 September. This was disclosed by the Croatian 
permanent mission at the UN, which has submitted a formal 
request to this effect to UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali. The text of the request stresses that the efforts 
made by international mediators have so far produced no results 
that could be described as significant progress in implementing 
UN Security Council resolutions. By signing the Zagreb 
agreement Croatia has shown its readiness to resolve the problem 
of its occupied areas peacefully. But the Serb side -- by 
refusing to resume the talks -- is showing that it is not 
willing to accept the UN Security Council resolutions, while the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is continuing and speeding up the 
silent integration of these areas into its state system, the 
official request by the Croatian mission says.

  [Excerpt] At a news conference today, the parliamentary 
opposition presented its plans for the negotiations to be 
resumed with the ruling HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union] on 31 
May. Jasenka Dudic has the report. 
  [Dudic] We insist on the legality, democracy, and respect of 
the agreement, and the opposition will not back down on this 
because it believes that the legislative authorities must be an 
example in honoring those principles. However, the opposition 
is ready to make concessions, but it also has its own 
conditions. Drazen Budisa [chairman of the main opposition 
party, Croatian Social Liberal Party] had the following to say: 
  [Begin Budisa recording] We are ready to repeat the 
procedure 
in the Chamber of Counties from the point at which it was 
suspended. We are prepared to be flexible concerning 
appointments, but the repetition of the procedure in the Chamber 
of Counties would, of course, demand that everything revert to 
the initial situation in the Chamber of Deputies. The positive 
fact, which in a way indicates the HDZ's flexibility, is that 
they are also ready to pass a confidence vote in Mr. Mihanovic 
[new president of the Chamber of Deputies] in the Chamber of 
Deputies. [end recording] 
  [Dudic] The opposition believes that the HDZ will show 
flexibility in the future too, and that a solution will be 
found. Failing this, the opposition will resign from all its 
parliamentary posts. If the crisis continues, the opposition 
believes that early elections are becoming increasingly 
possible. The opposition stresses that, although it is ready, 
early elections are not its aim. It wants to solve the 
parliamentary crisis in line with the Constitution, the code of 
practice, and the agreement. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Mate Granic, deputy prime minister and </F>
foreign minister, by Ivan Sabic; place and date not given: "In 
Vienna the Croats Supported a Joint Position"] 
  [Text] Apart from being occupied with intraparty 
negotiations, which were mentioned in the first part of the 
interview (conducted yesterday), Dr. Mate Granic, deputy prime 
minister and foreign minister, has been involved in the 
negotiations on the reintegration of the UNPA's [UN Protected 
Areas] into the constitutional and legal system of the Republic 
of Croatia, and has been regularly present at the peace talks on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. This part of the interview is dedicated to 
these talks and the meetings connected to their 
organization. 
  [Sabic] You have recently met with Veljko Knezevic, head of 
the Office of the "FRY" [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] in 
Zagreb. What was discussed at the meeting? 
  [Granic] Although it was our first meeting, many things were 
discussed. I clearly presented the Croatian positions regarding 
the issues of reintegration of the UNPA's, putting an end to the 
crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the need for a global 
solution. On the other hand, I explained why at this moment my 
visiting Belgrade is out of the question. Namely, before I 
would do so, there should be certain results in the negotiations 
with the Serbs and in the negotiations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
and some specific signals regarding these processes should come 
from Belgrade, too. I told him that our wish was to achieve 
peace, a peaceful reintegration of he UNPA's, and 
good-neighborly relations in the future, but all this will 
depend on the processes I have mentioned. 
  [Sabic] Mr. Knezevic has nevertheless announced your visit 
to Belgrade several times. 
  [Granic] My visit to Belgrade was agreed upon at the meeting 
with Zeljko Simic, deputy prime minister of the "FRY," but 
certain preconditions should be met for that to happen. 
<H5>  Optimism in the West </H5>
  [Sabic] Last week you were in Geneva, where the meeting of 
foreign ministers of the United States, Russia, and five 
European Union countries was held. Was there any mention on the 
necessity of parallel resolving of the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the reintegration of the UNPA's in the 
contacts you had there? 
  [Granic] I discussed this with the U.S. State Secretary 
Warren Christopher, with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, 
and Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. 
  [Sabic] What are their positions regarding the issue? 
  [Granic] Silajdzic fully supports this position, and we 
could say we also have the support of the United States and 
Germany, although they believe that the resolution to the crisis 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina is a much greater problem than the 
reintegration of the UNPA's. 
  [Sabic] However, certain optimism has appeared in the West 
regarding this great problem. Alain Juppe has stated that the 
next meeting of the seven foreign ministers could be the new 
opportunity for a decision. 
  [Granic] Optimism is necessary after this dirty war. At 
present certain optimism can be recognized in the fact that 
there is good coordination between the United States, the 
European Union, Russia, and United Nations, the main 
international forces. The announcement at the Geneva meeting 
leads to the conclusion that a peaceful solution will be found. 
There has been mention of a cease- fire and an agreement, and 
certain compromise dimensions have been presented. There has 
not been enough emphasis on what the quality of the territory 
offered to the Federation will be, or on the guarantees and 
mechanisms concerning the implementation, but the positive thing 
is that the talks are expected to begin late next week. The 
U.S. side directly informed us about that. 
<H5>  Percentages for the Croat-Bosniak Federation </H5>
  [Sabic] These talks are considered secret to a certain 
extent; the public does not know much about them. 
  [Granic] This is up to the contact group that organizes the 
negotiations and the three sides that negotiate. 
  [Sabic] You have mentioned the quality of the territory for 
the Federation. However, the percentages are also questionable, 
as there is a difference between the Vienna agreement and the 
international community plan regarding the issue. 
  [Granic] The Vienna agreement on the external borders of the 
Federation was made on the basis of certain principles. First 
the principles were adopted, and only then the outer borders of 
the Federation, which, in compliance with these principles, 
include the territories in which the Croats and Bosniaks are the 
majority, which is 58 percent of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
territory. With this the negotiating position of the Federation 
was made. Naturally, the Serb side also has its own negotiating 
position: In the negotiations its starting point is the 
proposal that the Federation be given 43 percent of the 
territory. The international community has suggested that it be 
51 percent. 
  [Sabic] This is approximately the mean value. 
  [Granic] Yes. But it is important what the quality of the 
territory is, and if there are certain problematic areas about 
which it will not be possible to reach an agreement -- whether 
they will be under UN control until the issue is resolved 
through arbitration.... Naturally, only the Federation can 
negotiate that. In the negotiations the Federation 
representatives will be on one side, and on the other will be 
the representatives of the Serbs of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Sabic] It was agreed in Vienna that two cantons would be 
formed with equivalent authorities, which is a great and, we 
could add, unexpected compromise. However, there are opinions 
that these are not the best solutions, and that they will not be 
able to facilitate peace, the return of the refugees, and the 
return to normal life. What is your opinion? 
  [Granic] First it should be emphasized that the Croat 
people in Bosnia-Herzegovina have always supported the 
preserving of Bosnia-Herzegovina as an integral, but 
decentralized country. This is the continuity of Croat policies 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. On the other hand, it should be 
emphasized that the starting position of the Bosniaks was a 
unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina, the so-called civil state, that the 
Serbs wanted the division even before the war, and that in the 
war, with the help of the Yugoslav Army, they conquered about 70 
percent of the territory, while the international community did 
nothing effective to stop this. Now there are certain realities 
within which the Croats departed from their concept the least, 
which is evident in the fact that now a decentralized federation 
exists. The cantons in central Bosnia and the valley of the 
Neretva River are a compromise, as you have said, and there are 
no losers there. It is very important that there are no losers! 
  These two cantons, connected by a purely Croat canton, and 
leaning on the Republic of Croatia, are, with all the 
constitutional provisions, an additional guarantee of the 
equality of the Croat people in the federation. It is possible 
to understand the fear, and the opposition of those who thought 
that annexation to Croatia was the only solution. For them it 
is a great change to live in the federation and be confederally 
connected to Croatia, which will be specifically defined only 
when the agreement with the Serbs is finalized. However, we 
should bear in mind that this is a model supported both by the 
Croat public and the whole world. 
<H5>  Ljubic and Pandzic Cooperated </H5>
  [Sabic] What can be done to overcome the fear of the Croats 
who remain in these "parity" cantons? 
  [Granic] Their fears are realistic. We should therefore 
primarily consider how we can help the Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially those who had to leave their 
homes, how to return the refugees, help in the restoration.... 
It needs to be explained to the Croats there that Croatia will 
always be with them, that the Croatian corps in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will be protected by constitutional 
guarantees, and that they will have international support. I 
prefer explanations and help to conflicts. 
  [Sabic] Before the Vienna negotiations there was much talk 
about sabotaging the agreement; certain Bosniak officials were 
openly accusing the Croat side of obstructing its 
implementation. Was this mentioned in the talks with the Bosniak 
representatives? 
  [Granic] Fear and resistance of individuals exist on both 
sides. However, there is great decisiveness on both sides, and 
there is also something that is called the total Croatian 
interest, which can be actualized through the Washington 
agreement, and that is why we have been fighting for its 
implementation. We are therefore in contact with the Bosniak 
side; we discuss all the practical issues, and issues such as 
those concerning the degree of the liberalization of entering 
Croatia, entering Bosnia-Herzegovina through Croatia, the 
situation with the refugees, the refugee aid to Croatia.... 
  [Sabic] The ethnically mixed Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation 
was present at the Vienna talks. Ivo Komsic, Vlado Pandzic, and 
Mariofil Ljubic were in the delegation. What cooperation did 
you establish with them? Was the presence of Croats in the two 
delegations a sign of division in the Croat people in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina? 
  [Granic] Mr. Ljubic and Mr. Pandzic immediately went to the 
room in which the Croat delegation was, asking to be accepted as 
part of the Croat corps, and they were very constructive in the 
negotiation process. Naturally, the direct negotiations were 
conducted by the delegation consisting of gentlemen Zubak, 
Akmadzic, Buntic, and Markotic. As far as Mr. Komsic is 
concerned, he only attended the first plenary session, and we 
did not see him later. He also made some statements, saying that 
nothing would come out of the negotiations. 
  [Sabic] Judging by the recent appearances, one could say 
that the divisions between the Croat politicians in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina have been mitigated. The public appearances 
used to be much sharper.... 
  [Granic] There were absolutely no divisions in Vienna. The 
Croats supported a joint position. 
<H5>  Visit to Sarajevo -- a Question of Arrangement </H5>
  [Sabic] During his short visit in Zagreb, president of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency Alija Izetbegovic sent a short 
letter to President Tudjman, reminding him of the visit to 
Sarajevo he had promised he would make. Will the visit be 
announced soon? What is the nature of the difficulties that have 
caused the visit to be postponed? 
  [Granic] There are no political difficulties; both sides 
want this visit to happen. There are only technical 
difficulties, from the security ones to the question of time 
acceptable to both sides, with regard to the obligations of both 
presidents. This was discussed in the last talk with Mr. 
Silajdzic, but will not yet be released in public. 
  [Sabic] On that occasion you met with Mr. Izetbegovic. Did 
you achieve the same degree of coordination concerning topical 
issues as you had done with Mr. Silajdzic? 
  [Granic] When you compare that meeting with the Bonn 
negotiations, this is a completely different story. It was 
possible to discern a determination to implement the agreement, 
to cooperate with Croatia, have President Tudjman for a visit, 
and consider certain practical aspects of cooperation. All in 
all, it was a pleasant meeting. 
  [Sabic] Was there a difference in relation to the Serbs? 
Namely, it seems that the Croats are still in favor of an 
agreement and peaceful solution, while the Bosniak side, 
according to a recent statement by Mr. Izetbegovic, keep the 
military option open too. 
  [Granic] These differences are getting smaller and smaller. 
The Croats primarily support the peaceful option. However, they 
are asking for firm guarantees for the agreement and its 
implementation. If there is a difference, it is because the 
Bosniaks are much more endangered, as the Serbs have occupied a 
significant part of their territory. The positions toward the 
Serbs have become closer for another reason, and that is that 
the Bosniak side has begun to realize that the possibility of 
the Serbs entering the Federation under equal conditions is very 
small. The Croats understood that from the beginning. 
  [Sabic] Perhaps it would be better to say that the Bosniaks 
also understood it from the beginning, but could not accept it? 
  [Granic] Yes, you could put it that way too. As can be seen 
from the Geneva announcement, the world is at present talking 
about a loose union between the Croat-Bosniak federation and the 
Serb territory. This is a model through which the territorial 
integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina should be preserved, it is the 
reality of the present, and the Bosniak side is aware of this 
reality. 
<H5>  No Changing Borders With Neighbors </H5>
  [Sabic] Finally, could you tell us a few words about the 
relations between the Republic of Croatia and the neighboring 
countries, considering that, after the elections in Italy and 
Hungary, this is a very interesting topic? 
  [Granic] Despite the change of the party in power, we are 
not expecting any changes in the relations with Hungary. As far 
as Italy is concerned, some people from Fini's party have issued 
certain statements unacceptable to Croatia. However, they were 
followed by other statements among which the most important one 
was the one made by the Italian foreign minister -- it concerned 
the necessity of preserving the borders. We therefore hope that 
the Italian government will conduct the policy of 
good-neighborly relations. 
  [Sabic] Perhaps this is partly a result of certain 
suggestions the U.S. administration officials had given the new 
Italian government. 
  [Granic] Warren Christopher said very clearly that the 
United States firmly supported the position that the territorial 
integrity of the Republic of Croatia must not be questioned. 
This fact cannot be neglected.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Franjo Tudjman, president of the 
Republic of Croatia and supreme commander of the Armed Forces, 
promoted 11 Croatian Army officers to the rank of general. 
[passage omitted] Patriotic war decorations for the 1990-92 
period were also awarded at the ceremony. Zoltan Kabok reports: 
  [Kabok] Addressing the promoted officers and high-ranking 
officials on Statehood Day, Franjo Tudjman spoke about the past 
four years, the realization of the centuries-old dream of the 
Croatian people, and the creation and strengthening of the 
Croatian Army. Three-quarters of the homeland have been 
liberated so far, and one quarter is still occupied. It is our 
historic task to liberate every inch, Tudjman stressed. 
  [Begin Tudjman recording] Of course, this is the task of the 
whole of the Croatian nation, but primarily of the Croatian 
Armed Forces, the Croatian Army. We can fulfill that task only 
if we have --as so far--a united Croatian people, and if our 
authorities keep scoring successes in economic recovery and 
international affirmation of Croatia. [end recording] 
  [Kabok] The president of the republic and supreme commander 
of the Armed Forces also spoke about Croatia's international 
position and said that we had to be ready to help the Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to ensure their survival, and that we must 
secure the strategic borders of the Croatian state. [passage

  [Text] After the Serbs based in Bosnia launched a sudden 
attack on the wider area of Zupanja in the Republic of Croatia 
with nine destructive shells at 1125 this morning, a general 
alert was sounded in Zupanja. Around midday Slavonski Samac 
also came under attack. According to a report from the Croatian 
border police, the Bosnian Serbs fired around 15 fragmentation 
shells on Slavonski Samac. There have been no casualties in 
these attacks, but huge material damage was caused. 
  In another Serb attack on the area of Orasje and Samac [in 
Bosnia] several civilians were wounded and fresh material damage 
was caused. The Serbs attacked that area with 
surface-to-surface missiles that they fired exclusively on 
civilian targets and business facilities.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Franjo Tudjman at a ceremony marking </F>
the launch of the kuna, the new Croatian currency, at the 
National Bank of Croatia in Zagreb on 30 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] There can be no doubt that the introduction of the 
national currency is the final act on the thorny path to 
establishing the independent and sovereign Croatian state. As 
the governor said, in order to be able to pass such a decision, 
we had to create certain conditions -- political, economic, and 
international. 
  In the political sphere, we had to strengthen the democratic 
system in the Republic of Croatia. In the economy, we had to 
complete the reconstruction, the transformation of ownership, 
the restructuring of the socialist economy, of the socialist 
system into the free market. Of course, that task has not yet 
been completed but we have laid the foundations for it. We have 
made achievements in the stabilization program and in curbing 
inflation, despite unfavorable circumstances and despite the 
consequences of the war. The former governments -- of Greguric 
and Sarinic -- have contributed to it, and the government of 
Nikica Valentic added the final stroke, prompting the 
astonishment and admiration of the world and of economic 
experts. 
  In the international sphere we had to create conditions for 
Croatia to consolidate its position, for it to become not only 
internationally recognized, but also to win allies in the world 
both politically and economically. Today Croatia has such 
allies in the modern world. 
  These were the preconditions necessary for us to launch this 
final act of marking the national sovereignty of the Croatian 
people and of the Croatian state. 
  And as for the name: The Croatian nation is one of the 
oldest 
in Europe and it has the right to give its currency an original 
name. As academician Brozovic proved in his thesis, a long time 
ago, the mink [kuna] was a means of payment in the Croatian 
lands from Slavonia to Istria. The fur of the marten was a 
means of payment in other countries as well, but I do not know 
of any other country that attached the same significance to the 
mink as it had in Croatian history and [words indistinct]. 
Thus, the marten is on the historic coat-of-arms of the 
historic Croatian Kingdom of Slavonia. Therefore, we have the 
right to give our currency a different name, the one we have 
preserved in financial transactions since time immemorial. This 
is why we decided, in that respect as well -- we have survived 
as a peculiar, different national entity in Europe and in the 
world -- to appear in the world with a different name for our 
currency. 
  At all times and in all countries, the introduction of a 
national currency is of major significance in the moral, 
political, psychological, and economic sense. I am convinced 
that the introduction of our currency -- the kuna and lipa -- 
will have the same significance, that it will encourage our 
people -- from schoolchildren to the elderly -- to treat our 
currency in a more serious and economical way in business and in 
the state administration, so that it becomes the basis for 
faster economic and cultural development, the basis for our 
successful cooperation with the modern world because, I believe, 
it will retain convertibility owing to the results achieved. 
  The Croatian people deserve that. They have contributed, 
they have in fact achieved this in a political, economic and, 
unfortunately, military sense by defending their homeland from 
aggression. The Croatian people today have their own currency 
as a means for their future development. 
  As head of state, I would like to express the homeland's 
gratitude to all the people who have created the preconditions 
for the introduction of our currency and to all the people, 
technicians and artists, who were directly involved in creating 
the beautiful design of our currency. 
  Thank you, and let the historic path of our new Croatian 
currency be happy. [applause]

<F P=106> [Interview with Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the </F>
Democratic Left, SDL, and SDL Deputy Chairman Milan Ftacnik by 
Martin Krno; place and date not given: "Opening for the Heart of 
Europe"] 
  [Excerpt] Immediately after the return of the two-member 
Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] delegation from the United 
States, we asked SDL chairman Peter Weiss and SDL deputy 
chairman Milan Ftacnik to share with us their immediate 
impressions from their almost week- long talks with 
representatives of political and economic circles in Washington. 
  [Weiss] Our meetings with high-level U.S. politicians, who 
included George Mitchell, leader of the Democratic majority in 
the Senate, and Strobe Talbott, deputy secretary of state, were 
an opportunity to present the policy of the present Slovak 
Government, in which the SDL is the biggest coalition partner. 
The talks demonstrated growing interest in Slovakia, also on 
the part of foreign investors, following the change of 
government in our country. It has been confirmed once again 
that the SDL is an internationally recognized political party. 
U.S. politicians realize that Slovakia's further political 
future depends, to a decisive degree, on the SDL as the second 
strongest political force in the Slovak Republic and on the 
result that the left-wing coalition will achieve in the 
forthcoming elections. 
  [Krno] When the then prime minister returned from Washington 
last year, he declared in public several times that he could not 
enter into a coalition with Weiss' party because that would halt 
the influx of U.S. capital to Slovakia. Has the Americans' 
attitude toward the SDL changed? 
  [Weiss] If I wanted to be malicious, I would say something 
similar about the previous government. But I would rather stick 
to the facts. Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova's 
talks in the United States, with the IMF and the World Bank, 
clearly earned her the image of a competent economist who 
represents a certain personal guarantee of economic 
transformation in our country. U.S. politicians accept her 
view, which she expressed also at the meeting of an IMF 
commission, that transformation must be carried out in a way 
that is socially sustainable. Our discussions included, for 
example, talks with representatives of the Chemical Bank, the 
third largest U.S. bank, who are seriously interested in 
becoming involved in Slovakia. 
  [Ftacnik] The visit confirmed that the doors for the SDL in 
U.S. political and business circles are open. The former prime 
minister's fabrications of one year ago are turning out to have 
been false. 
  [Krno] Does the United States not fear that there might be a 
setback in our political development after the early elections 
to the National Council of the Slovak Republic? 
  [Weiss] It transpired from our talks that, after the new 
government assumed office, Slovakia has really joined the 
category of interesting countries. There can be no talk of our 
isolation. The views of U.S. politicians could be summed up in 
the statement of one of our interlocutors: "We realize that 
Slovakia is the heart of Europe. If it became sick, the serious 
question would arise what will become of the whole of Europe." 
  [Krno] How did you interpret during your talks the term 
socially sustainable reform? Where is the limit that the United 
States is ready to accept without accusing the government 
coalition of populism? 
  [Weiss] U.S. politicians regard as such a limit the 
endangerment of social peace and the creation of an explosive 
situation. No one in the United States wishes to see that 
because it is also in their vital interest that Central Europe 
be a stable region. They realize the complexity of 
transformation but they also realize that, if it is not carried 
out in a socially tolerable way, conditions will arise for the 
emergence of authoritarian, populist, and nationalist regimes. 
That is what they fear most of all. 
  [Ftacnik] The credibility of Slovakia in international 
business and financial circles has increased and there is hope 
and a chance that, when we lead our budget and economic policy 
in a reasonable direction and conduct it in a justifiable way, 
we may in a relatively short time obtain major foreign credits. 
This would help us tackle the debt inherited from the previous 
government, especially in the spheres of education, health 
services, and some other branches. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Integration into West European and trans-Atlantic 
structures, and the creation of conditions for full membership 
of Slovakia in NATO are the fundamental goals of our foreign 
policy, as formulated in the presentation document submitted by 
the Slovak delegation at the NATO headquarters in Brussels on 25 
May. As Slovak Defense Minister Pavol Kanis said in today's 
edition of the television discussion program "Kroky," we have 
thus become one of 16 countries to have signed the Partnership 
for Peace initiative. 
  In connection with bringing Slovakia into the security 
structures of Western Europe, Pavol Kanis stressed the 
inevitability of a reorganization of our Armed Forces. 
  Josef Prokes, the honorary chairman of the Slovak National 
Party, who is foreign minister in Meciar's shadow cabinet, 
pointed out that the European stability pact in itself was not 
dangerous but could be abused. Western Europe, according to 
him, has not solved the problem of minorities and yet expected 
East European countries to do so. 
  Foreign Minister Edvard Kukan observed that minority 
problems 
could be solved on an international level by means of the CSCE 
and on the Council of Europe level.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "U. Hewer: Two Largest Slovak Banks and Two </F>
Smaller Banks Are Having Problems"] 
  [Text] Bratislava -- The two largest Slovak banks and two 
smaller institutions are having problems as a result of 
irrecoverable loans and lack of experience. Ulrich Hewer, 
representative of the World Bank in Slovakia, told the REUTER 
agency that the problems affect Slovenska Statna Sporitelna 
[Slovak State Savings Bank] (SSSP), Vseobecna Uverova Banka 
[General Credit Bank] (VUB), Investicna a Rozvojova Banka 
[Investment and Development Bank] (IRB), and Konsolidacna Banka 
[Consolidation Bank] (KB). The SSSP with a capital of 2.1 
billion Slovak korunas [Sk] tops the ranking of 16 Slovak banks, 
the VUB with a capital of Sk2 billion is in second place and the 
largest creditor. The IRB is in fourth place and the KB in 11th 
place in terms of the size of their capital. 
  "We think that the SSSP is having problems. Over the last 
two years it extended a large number of unreasonable loans. We 
have discussed the issue with the Slovak National Bank (NBS) and 
agreed that a solution will have to be found." The World Bank 
expects the SSSP and the other banks to be placed under control 
before it helps the Slovak Republic restructure the banking 
system. "We are waiting for the results of an audit, which 
should be available by the end of this month. A mission of 
inquiry will come to Slovakia in mid-June 1994 and these talks 
will hopefully lead to a solution." 
  NBS representatives were not able to specify the size of the 
four banks' irrecoverable loans. They noted that in Slovakia no 
rules exist for rating risks. "We are in the initial stage of 
collecting information and the relevant documents." The 
"Memorandum" that the Slovak Government had prepared for the 
World Bank last fall noted that the SSSP did not have experience 
in lending money, even though it holds 90 percent of Slovak 
private deposits. "We are afraid lest its efforts to become a 
universal bank jeopardize its deposits." 
  "I fundamentally disagree with Ulrich Hewer's view," says KB 
Director General Jan Pichonsky. He assumes that Ulrich Hewer 
may have arrived at his conclusion on the basis of an audit for 
1993 that was carried out in the KB by the Deloitte &amp; Touche 
company. Last week it submitted to the KB the final report, in 
which it recommends to the management that the bank increase the 
reserves prescribed by law to almost 10 times their present 
level. Jan Pichonsky considers the recommendation incorrect 
because "it does not correspond to the state of the Slovak legal 
system and to the reality." 
  "The IRB denies Ulrich Hewer's assertion," says Vladimir 
Kovacik, IRB director general and member of the IRB Board of 
Directors. The IRB's positive situation is also documented by 
the 1993 auditors' report from the renowned British firm Ernst 
&amp; 
Young. 
  "We received the REUTER report at the time of the annual 
meeting of VUB shareholders, which approved the economic results 
for last year and a proposal for the division of profits. This 
proposal provides for the payment of dividends to shareholders 
at the amount of 10 percent of the shares' nominal value, that 
is, Sk100 per share. We were surprised by the formulations used 
by Ulrich Hewer from the World Bank and Peter Bajcik, the author 
of the REUTER report. We do not know the two gentlemen, who 
have neither visited the VUB nor have received any documentation 
from us," states a statement issued by VUB President Jozef 
Mudrik. "Our bank, as one of the successors to the Czechoslovak 
State Bank, has taken over some credits that had been extended 
under the command system of national economic management and the 
returnability of which is endangered. Over the past four years 
the VUB has increased the credit volume by only approximately 4 
percent, which demonstrates that it has been extending new loans 
on a very limited scale. Therefore, it could not be extending 
any new bad loans," Jozef Mudrik states. "Because of our 
awareness of the problem of the quality of banks' credit 
portfolio, we were one of the first banks in the then CSFR to 
have its economic results and the quality of its credit 
portfolio verified by the international firm of auditors Coopers 
&amp; Lybrant as early as 1991. We publish the results of these 
audits annually and send them to all our partner banks abroad. 
On the basis of these audits, the bank has been accepted by 
many foreign insurance companies and, on this basis, also by 
foreign partner banks, with which it is engaged in mutually 
beneficial partner relations," the VUB president's statement 
says in conclusion. 
  [Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak on 27 May on pages 1 
and 
2 carries a 700-word TA SR report on the REUTER report, and the 
Slovak banks' reactions to it, which includes the following 
additional passage on the NBS's reaction: "The NBS draws the 
attention of the population to the fact that deposits in the 
largest Slovak banks are guaranteed by the Slovak Republic and 
various conjectures about their safety are groundless. 
  ["Bad loans occur in every economy and are no exceptional 
phenomenon. Only the extent of these loans can be exceptional. 
The situation in Slovak commercial banks is no worse than in 
other transforming economies, in which loans had been allocated 
in the past on the basis of administrative decisions. The NBS, 
in cooperation with state bodies, is aware of this problem and 
is ready to deal with it, after the appropriate analyses are 
carried out. On no account will the solution affect depositors. 
  ["The NBS does not identify with the contents of the 
interview with a World Bank representative published by REUTER 
on 25 May and considers its overall tenor distorted. The NBS 
secures, in accordance with the law, the stability of the 
banking system, as is normal in all countries, and, in this 
process, it also holds talks with the World Bank and the IMF. 
The two institutions have not officially confirmed such an 
extent of the problem of bad assets as indicated by the REUTER 
interview. The NBS will consult on its contents with World Bank 
representatives in Washington."]

  [Excerpts] A cooperation agreement between the Interior 
Ministries of the Russian Federation and the Slovak Republic was 
signed in Moscow today by Ministers Viktor Yerin and Ladislav 
Pittner. [passage omitted] 
  Our correspondent Jan Smihula interviewed Ladislav Pittner 
shortly before the minister's departure from the Russian 
capital. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin recording] [Smihula] Mr. Minister, your talks with 
your Russian counterpart lasted 30 minutes longer than 
originally planned. Does this mean that some disagreements, 
problems have emerged? How do you assess today's talks? 
  [Pittner] Our talks lasted longer not because of 
disagreements, but because of discussing further spheres of 
cooperation on which agreements are being drafted by our experts 
for signing. Above all, this concerns the issue of police 
attaches who are to work in our two countries. A Russian police 
attache based in Bratislava will probably be accredited to also 
work in other countries of Central and Eastern Europe. 
Regarding our police attache, I was promised that he will be 
given opportunities to widen his activities to reach other 
former Soviet republics. 
  The other issue concerned archives and we received full 
support from the minister for gaining access to the archives to 
see, for instance, files on people taken against their will to 
Russia. [passage omitted] 
  We were also promised help in searching for one part of the 
President Jozef Tiso [World War II pro-Nazi leader] archive.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Stefan Prodev: "Undiplomatic and Insulting"] </F>
  [Text] I know that [U.S. Ambassador] Mr. Montgomery and 
[Russian Ambassador] Mr. Avdeyev will be insulted, but what can 
I do? I cannot ignore their meetings with Ahmed Dogan at the 
parliamentary office of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms 
[DPS]. The appearance of both ambassadors was so unexpected 
that even experienced parliamentarians such as Mr. Lyutfi began 
to stutter in their confusion in front of the journalists. The 
journalists, who know why, recalled a Latin American state and a 
Central Asian republic where, until recently, the ambassadors of 
the United States and Russia read the presidents' speeches. 
  The urgent visits of Mr. Montgomery and Mr. Avdeyev confused 
even further the already confused parliament. It became more 
than obvious that our man from Washington and our man from 
Moscow must tell the same person something very important. 
Moreover, the thing they had to tell him was so important that 
they had to tell it to him separately, in a provocative manner. 
First the journalists and then the deputies understood that the 
"invisible" Ahmed is one of the main "mailboxes" of certain 
foreign embassies in Bulgaria. It was not by an accident that, 
after the meetings, the DPS leader found himself in the focus of 
the political attention. Despite the fact that no one has 
precise quotations from the talks in the DPS office, it is 
certain that the two ambassadors utilized Dogan in order to 
obtain assurances or dividends from the last cabinet crisis. 
Unfortunately, the Turkish ambassador did not take place in the 
operational meetings, because then one would have seen even 
better the real essence of the "mailbox." 
  In this case we are concerned not so much with Dogan's 
discreet role, as by the open interference of the U.S. and 
Russian ambassadors in the game. We understand their desire to 
thoroughly comprehend the secrets of the Bulgarian puzzle, but 
nevertheless, a cabinet crisis is a purely Bulgarian affair, and 
every foreign interference, even through a straw man, cannot be 
accepted without alarm. This already is not an attempt to 
render a selfless help, but a most careless blow against our 
dignity as an independent state. What would have happened for 
example, if the Bulgarian ambassadors in Washington and Moscow 
would run to the Congress or the State Duma in order to learn 
their secrets at the time of an acute political clash? 
Undoubtedly, this would have been described as a scandal, and 
our officials would have parted with their diplomatic careers. 
Unfortunately, the American and the Russian are not threatened 
by such a fate. They not only feel themselves rather free under 
our conditions, but also demonstrate no sense of tact. 
Obviously, in their imperial awareness, the Bulgaria of today is 
a Balkan Haiti or a Balkan Ossetia, over whose destiny Russia 
and the United States have unlimited powers. I could be wrong, 
but the two ambassadors could hardly deny the fact that these 
scandalous meetings with Dogan under the roof of the parliament, 
at a critical moment for Bulgaria, contains certain colonial 
elements. 
  I am not writing these lines only as a journalist, but also 
as a deputy who was personally insulted by the two diplomats. 
This is so because their unexpected visits are political 
interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state in any 
normal language. The two gentlemen emerged the parliament at 
the most unsuitable moment, as if they wanted to assure us that 
without them Bulgaria cannot resolve its problems. This is not 
concern or diplomacy, but a real inference with our own will. I 
feel uncomfortable having to say this, but what else could I say 
to them? 
  Apparently, Mr. Montgomery and Mr. Avdeyev are not bothered 
by scandals, and therefore they create them themselves. This 
might be an accepted style of behavior in diplomacy, but in 
Bulgaria, where nerves have been strained by the situation, such 
behavior could only be damaging. It repels and insults, 
something that evokes concern. This is what the two diplomats 
should know when they attempt to directly influence our 
political reality. Despite its current drama, Bulgaria is 
neither Haiti nor Ossetia. It is not an enclave or a strip. It 
respects the strong ones, but it also demands respect from them. 
People such as Dogan, regardless of how convenient they are for 
various maneuvers, are not the real face of Bulgaria. They are 
only a complex particle of our national landscape, which does 
not fully express our interests. Therefore, it is irresponsible 
of anyone to turn them into an important factor. If the United 
States and Russia want to indicate a position on certain 
Bulgarian problems, they must seek a more authoritative 
"mailbox." Otherwise they could experience disappointments. 
After all, the "mailbox" could always be blamed and produce a 
confusing message. This is especially important in Bulgaria, 
which has experienced everything, including a 500-year Turkish 
yoke, but has never been a colony, and will never be one!

<F P=106> [Report by Varshava Maksimova] </F>
  [Text] Today Professor Krustyu Petkov, leader of the 
Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria [KNSB], 
met with the leadership of the Bulgarian Economic Chamber [BSK]. 
Both sides expressed the view that the present government has 
finally changed over to an antisocial stance. 
  After the meeting, Krustyu Petkov stated that since the 
Berov 
cabinet is illegitimate and it is impossible to conduct a 
serious dialogue with it, he will resort to an unusual approach 
for our country, namely, for the trade unions and employers to 
hold bilateral talks on topical problems. He said that tomorrow 
it is likely that the two sides -- the KNSB and BSK -- will sign 
a document in which they will call upon other social partners to 
join them. 
  This afternoon the KNSB Executive Committee held a session 
to 
discuss the draft project that the Council of Ministers has 
submitted for compensating incomes during the second quarter 
that, in his words, was like throwing dust in the eyes of the 
trade unions and the discontented population. 
  During the next few days, the KNSB will also discuss 
specific 
forms for applying trade union pressure, including boycotting 
the payment of bills for thermal and electric power, with the 
aim of unblocking the accord reached on income policy from the 
beginning of the year.

<F P=106> [Article by Boyan Marinov: "Nuclear Bosses Again Covered Up </F>
the Truth"] 
  [Excerpt] It was reported through the newspapers a few 
days ago that the No. 1 Reactor Unit at the Kozloduy Nuclear 
Power Plant was shut down because of a fault in one of the six 
cooling pumps. Kozloduy Plant Chief Dyanko Dobrev specified: 
"There is no danger of an accident; the unit could have 
continued operating, but we stopped it for reasons of greater 
security." According to Nikita Shervashidze, chief of the state 
department responsible for power supply [National Electricity 
Company], the fault could have been corrected very quickly, but 
the reactor had to be checked before reentering service. 
  Following an old tradition, the nuclear chiefs said little, 
but kept quiet about much more. In this case, they failed to 
divulge the truth about the danger of an accident after the 
reactor was shut down. 
  According to specialists, the situation that arose in the 
No. 
2 Unit is reminiscent of the dangerous incident in September 
1981 that REPORTER 7 wrote about in Issue No. 14 of 8 April 
1994. The difference is that the second time the emergency 
situation occurred, the reactor was shut down. 
  Following a suspected leak, the first cooling circuit was 
shut down to repair the vent of the No. 1 main circulating pump. 
While this repair was in progress, due to inadequate control on 
the part of the operating staff, a infraction occurred of the 
regulations related to the cooling of the nuclear fuel in the 
reactors' active zone. This led to a dangerous situation. The 
cooling water in the active zone boiled, negatively affecting 
the removal of heat, and this could have led to overheating and 
a risk of leakage from the heat-removing elements that contain 
nuclear fuel. 
  In figurative terms, the incident was like a electric kettle 
full of boiling water. If the kettle boils dry, it will burn 
out. This popular comparison is also correct regarding the 
so-called human factor. Operator error, or more specifically 
gross negligence and irresponsibility, again produced the 
critical situation. Specialists assume that the rise in the 
radiation level in the premises housing the first circuit make 
the dozing staff "wake up" and react to the situation. 
  Competent sources describe the incident as "a very serious 
emergency situation." It eloquently confirms once again that 
the nuclear plant has been left in a state of anarchy and poor 
control, as REPORTER 7 noted in its previous article. It seems 
that the maxim of "if you get away with it, that is all well and 
good," which seems to have been adopted almost as a rule by our 
nuclear managers, has been passed down the line and reached the 
junior staff of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant. [passage

  [Text] Mr. Khristodhoulos Tsalikis, ambassador of the 
Greek Republic in Tirana, was summoned to a meeting at the

  Mr. Tsalikis was also told that if the Greek side is not 
interested in misinforming its own public, as well as the

should contact the proper Albanian organs to be informed 
correctly. 
  Mr. Tsalikis was further told that the dissemination of 
false

Government causes one to think that they are an expression of a 
lack of will on the Greek side to overcome the present 
difficulties in relations between the two countries.

<F P=106> ["E.G."-initialed report: "Waves of Albanian </F>
Radio-Television Jammed"] 
  [Text] Dibra e Madhe [Debar], the historic city of the 
Diber region that remained under Serbia (today's Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]) in 1913, has 
for some years been watching the programs of Albanian 
Radio-Television [RTSh] via the television booster at Homesh, 
which sends out a signal to all Diber. 
  Albanian Television's many viewers in the city of Dibra e 
Madhe point out the fact that RTSh is being jammed. The jamming 
stations installed on the border with Albania many years ago are 
still being kept in action throughout RTSh's broadcasting time. 
  In the past, when barbed wire divided the two Dibers and 
during the "ideologic war" between Albania and Yugoslavia, 
television-jamming was part of the systems that ruled in both 
countries, although Skopje Television was never jammed in 
Peshkopi. Now, with freedom of the press and information, 
freedom of movement, and advancing democratic processes, the 
attitude and action of the Macedonian side in jamming RTSh is 
totally anachronistic and incomprehensible. 
  It is also impossible to understand why Macedonia is 
pursuing 
the old-style politics and practice of isolating the Albanians 
by jamming RTSh on purpose, at a time when Albania has opened 
all its doors and windows to Macedonia. Let us not go into the 
extremely cold response to the introduction of the Albanian 
press and literature in the Albanian regions of Macedonia. 
  Our government is aware of these problems, because they have 
been raised in public on other occasions. It is regrettable 
that, where they are concerned, it still pretends to be blind, 
deaf, and dumb.

<F P=106> [Report by Rezear Xhaxhiu from the Tirana Court] </F>
  [Text] The trial of the last 10 former leaders of 
communist Albania resumed today with explanations by defendants 
Simon Stefani and Hekuran Isai. For details on this hearing, 
let us follow our correspondent at the trial: 
  [Xhaxhiu] Today's hearing of the trial of 10 high 
functionaries of the Albanian communist state opened with 
explanations by the defendant Simon Stefani. The leadership of 
the Party of Labor of Albania [PPSh] is the only unfortunate 
leadership of all the Eastern communist countries to have such a 
destiny and experience prison, the former number one at the 
Interior Ministry stated in his explanations. The former 
Politburo member did not neglect giving a further 
philosophic-Marxist analysis of the political party system that 
prevailed for decades on end in Albania, stressing that the 
party decisions had to be carried out. I did not order the 
dragging of dead bodies on the border, I did not order the 
shooting of those who crossed the border, he said. Speaking 
about other sections of the indictment, the defendant Stefani 
rejected them and considered the indictment to be generally 
erroneous and premeditated. 
  After theorizing about the impossibility of economic 
equality 
in socialism, the defendant explained further the practices that 
he had found in place, the implementation of standing 
regulations, and the efforts he had made in changing the 
instructions on telephone checks and the opening of mail. 
  The trial continued later with explanations by defendant 
Hekuran Isai, the other former interior minister. In his two 
hours of explanations, Isai attacked the past and present left 
and right wings, assessed the progressives in the bosom of the 
Politburo, and considered the PPSh to be fatally broken in the 
face of the hurricane of democratic youth. The defendant Isai, 
too, did not fail to carry out an autopsy on the regime at the 
pinnacle of which he had existed for many successive years. 
  Citing [Albanian patriot] Noli and [Albanian statesman] 
Saidi, passing from Spartacus to Achilles, from Enver Hoxha to 
Poland's [Communist Prime Minister] Rakowski, from a Kosovar 
poet to the Spanish Gonzales, the defendant spoke at length 
about social systems, the former PPSh Central Committee, the 
functioning of the Secretariat, and the expenses of the red 
group, which according to Isai's arithmetic, resulted in only 1 
cent grabbed each year from the Albanian people. 
  The former deputy chairman of the infamous Eviction-Exile 
Commission did not accept his role on this Commission. The post 
of deputy chairman, he said, does not constitute an error, just 
as the 118 decisions approved by him on the eviction and exile 
of dozens of innocent families do not constitute errors. Isai 
challenged the indictment with global figures. 
  The same stance was maintained in the previous hearing by 
defendant Manush Myftiu, the chief of the Commission. According 
to the Association of Former Convicted and Political Prisoners, 
there approximately 60,000 persons were imprisoned or exiled 
during the communist regime. The same association confirms that 
about 700,000 were persecuted nationally during this period. 
Nevertheless, on behalf of the defendants Isai and Myftiu, two 
of the leading characters on this infamous Commission, no one 
could dare to raise his voice against the existence of this 
Dantesque commission.

<F P=106> [Report by Rezear Xhaxhiu] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] At 1500 the testimony of 
Ramiz Alia was heard in the Tirana Court's hall. In a long 
apology of about two hours, the defendant rejected the 
accusation by often attacking it and frequently claiming that it 
did not present any concrete facts and that it is completely 
political and extremely (?hectic). 
  Continuing with his explanations, the former first secretary 
of the Party of Labor of Albania [PPSh] explained several 
sections in the indictment, with which he is charged. I have 
not accepted and will never accept the idea that I have 
misappropriated and abused, Alia insisted, who is charged with 
the criminal act of misappropriating state property in 
conspiracy and that of abuse of position in conspiracy, defined 
in Articles 62/13 and 106 of the Penal Code. 
  Defense Counsel Kleanthi Koci spoke in defense of his 
client. 
Koci denounced the grave violations that, as he said, were 
inflicted on his client. Counsel Koci, former chairman of the 
High Court of Appeals at Alia's time, stated that these 
violations are based on not knowing the constitution and having 
a low professional level. 
  No, rejoined Neshat Fana, the prosecutor. It is Alia himself 
who tried to give political coloring to his speech. The charges 
against the defendant are not based on when he was president, 
but for the time when he was party chairman. The prosecutor 
continued to say that the denouncements of hundreds of families 
of those convicted have been entered in the investigation file. 
They request that the defendant be convicted as a criminal, as 
the one who initiated ideas on the isolation and 
depersonalization of the people, massive evictions, murders on 
the border, as a continuer of [Enver] Hoxha's deeds, etc. The 
indictment does not charge the defendant with such claims, but 
accuses him of personal errors while he was at the head of a 
political party. The people conducted a political trial, as 
Alia is trying to represent today's hearing, against him in 
February 1991 and March 1992. 
  After the prosecutor's speech, Defendant Alia replied again, 
considering the speech of the prosecutor as a subterfuge against 
him. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] The report on the trial of former 
Albanian President Ramiz Alia and nine high-level party and 
state communist functionaries has just been finished. Marash 
Mirashi reports: 
  [Mirashi] Today's hearing opened with a request by Chairman 
Celiku for silence, due to the extreme heat and the large number 
of correspondents in the courtroom. It could be said that this 
is also a moral trial being conducted against the former party 
state. 
  [Begin former Interior Minister Simon Stefani recording] We 
should in no way forget that the Party of Labor [PPSh] at that 
time was not only a political organization, or rather the only 
party in power, but it was in fact a state party that performed 
state functions. [end recording] 
  [Begin former Interior Minister Hekuran Isai recording] We 
were a party state. The party decisions had a state power that 
was obligatory for the state and for society. The role of party 
state relied on the constitutional law. That is how it was. 
[end recording] 
  The defendants -- Simon Stefani, Hekuran Isai, and Ramiz 
Alia 
-- explained the indictment against them at today's hearing. It 
should be stressed that the defendants categorically negated 
everything as if they were inhabitants of an unexplored planet 
and not the main characters of an unprecedented dictatorship. 
  While most of the trial proceedings were being conducted in 
the hall, the shivering victims were in other halls of the 
Tirana Court testifying to correspondents [passage omitted 
including indistinct recorded passages]: 
  In his deposition, Stefani negated the charges, stating that 
his entire activity was in conformity with the law. According 
to him, nothing makes him responsible -- not the abuse of 
official position, the murders on the border, or his 
contribution to drafting the platform on state security. 
  While the evidence points to Stefani for the assassinations 
of a number of citizens on the southern border, he declared at 
the trial that he had not given any order. However, a telegram 
states the contrary. This is a political trial, he said. 
  Prosecutor Thana defended the indictment by building on 
authentic facts. Chairman Celiku then read the text of the 
telegram, which placed Simon Stefani in a very serious position. 
The defendant said that no one dared to oppose the Politburo. 
Chairman Celiku then asked him to recall several names of 
Politburo members during his time. Stefani named some 10 
Politburo members, dead and alive, including himself. 
  Chairman Celiku later requested some explanations from 
Hekuran Isai. He gave an extremely long speech of a theoretical 
character, which, at times, was mixed with a typical communist 
irony. He also admitted nothing. He said that the indictment 
is political. Meanwhile, the defendant, in general, expressed 
himself against the class struggle. I expressed my convictions 
against the class struggle even when I was interior minister, he 
said. I have never acted against the law. I have always 
applied decisions by the PPSh accurately. 
  The defense counsel of Isai proceeded to say that his client 
should be thanked for his tolerance and soothing of the 
dictatorship. 
  The chairman of the judicial body and the prosecutor asked 
Isai to explain the exiles and evictions. The defendant said 
that, while he was deputy chairman of this commission, he 
approved only 112 such decisions. 
  The explanations by Alia, though at an hour of hot and muggy 
weather, were received with interest by the media. The former 
head of state declared himself to be a political prisoner and, 
consequently, innocent. The former president claimed no 
responsibility. On the contrary, he claimed several merits. 
The indictment does not blame me in a legal way, Alia said. I 
did not participate in a conspiracy and I did not abuse my 
position. I have not approved the movement against religion 
alone in the Politburo, but together with the others, after we 
were convinced in the youth's movement against the religious 
cult. 
  The defense counsel claimed Alia to be innocent. We cannot 
judge on a former head of state. 
  Meanwhile, Chairman Celiku and Prosecutor Thana told him 
that 
we are not judging and charging Alia as a former president but 
on the basis of stored charges. The next hearing begins at 0900 
tomorrow.

  [Text] [Announcer] The trial of former Albania's last 
communist president and nine former state and party communist 
functionaries continued proceedings today. Marash Mirashi: 
  [Mirashi] At the beginning of today's hearing, Chairman 
Celiku requested explanations concerning the indictment from 
defendant Aranit Cela. In a very long speech in which slogans 
were not absent, the former prosecutor general, chairman of the 
High Court of Appeals, and deputy chairman of the Exile-Eviction 
Commission for half a century, presented himself to be innocent. 
  Defendant Cela is charged with abuse of position resulting 
in 
violation of the fundamental freedoms and rights of citizens and 
illegal arrests as a result of the application of the State 
Security platform approved by the Politburo of the Party of 
Labor. He is charged with a large number of illegal exiles. 
  Defendant Aranit Cela is also accused of illegal convictions 
regarding exiles and evictions, exiles that go back as far as 45 
years. What is worthy of stressing is the fact that Cela 
committed exiles and evictions without a court's decision, 
without declaring the persons guilty. Defendant Cela himself 
declared that they had also exiled persons that represented only 
a potential social danger, such as the case of innocent persons 
pursued or surveyed by the State Security. In this framework, 
we have carried out exiles en masse of the inhabitants of border 
areas under the pretext that they, one day, could cross the 
border, Cela said. 
  According to the prosecutor, defendant Aranit Cela 
approached 
the evidence of the indictment. 
  Prosecutor Fana said that in the judicial language, social 
danger is a sack for everybody. 
  The same charges fell on former prosecutor general Rrapi 
Mino. Among the monotonous rhythms of an oblong speech, the 
heat, and the claims of innocence by defendant Mino, the 
reporters, through a complete indifference, almost emptied the 
hall. 
  Defendant Rrapi Mino stated that he had never violated the 
law. After several questions by Chairman Celiku, the answers of 
the defendant Mino proved to be very disoriented. 
  With his intrusion based on charges, Prosecutor Fana, in a 
very correct way, presented facts and arguments of the committed 
murders. The counsels for the defense followed the tune of their 
clients. At this, today's hearing closed. The next session 
opens at 0900 tomorrow.

  [Text] Our editorial office has received a declaration by 
the Romanian Government on the launching of the process for the 
stability pact in Europe. The document reads as follows: 
  The proceedings of the inaugural conference on the stability 
pact in Europe concluded in Paris on 27 May 1994. Thirty-nine 
states and five international organizations adopted a political 
document whereby they reasserted their pledge to make a 
contribution to the efforts aimed at ensuring peace in Europe by 
promoting and expanding relations of cooperation and 
good-neighborliness. Teodor Melescanu, minister of state and 
minister of foreign affairs, headed the Romanian delegation at 
the conference of initiating a stability pact in Europe. 
  The Romanian Government reasserts its support for the basic 
goals of the stability pact in Europe, the first initiative of 
foreign policy and joint security of the European Union. The 
draft initiated by France and promoted by the European Union is 
part and parcel of the actions aimed at preparing the 
integration of the Eastern and Central European states that 
today enjoy the status of associate members of the European 
Union in the European and Euro- Atlantic structures. Romania's 
participation in the stability pact, the act of signing the 
Partnership for Peace, and the status of associate partner in 
the Western European Union are important steps to ensure our 
country's integration in European and Euro-Atlantic structures. 
  The endorsement of the initial declaration is the result of 
the joint efforts of the states that are members of the European 
Union, associated states -- including Romania -- and of the 
other countries interested in European stability. Romania has 
participated in a constructive manner and embarked on the 
process of defining the orientations of this initiative, that 
has a pragmatic character of preventive diplomacy. 
  Romania's Government displayed its political will to 
contribute to the success of this initiative by continuing 
negotiations on the conclusion of bilateral treaties with its 
neighbors, by including in the pact those treaties that have 
been concluded so far and by organizing certain meetings that 
are specific to the process of the pact regarding the rights of 
people who belong to ethnic minorities and the improvement of 
transportation and communication infrastructure. The future 
pact of stability in Europe is based on the principles generally 
accepted by the United States, the CSCE, and the Council of 
Europe. 
  Romania's Government learned with satisfaction that this 
ample project promoted by the European Union is aimed at putting 
value on the already established institutions and mechanisms, 
and the CSCE institutions first of all. Romania's Government 
believes that the endorsement of the Paris Declaration will give 
an impetus to the continuation of negotiations on the conclusion 
of basic treaties with neighboring countries, taking into 
account the principles expressed in the initial document of the 
pact. Romania's Government believes that stability in Europe is 
directly determined by the success of the transition processes 
in the eastern and central parts of the continent. Therefore, 
it believes that direct support granted to the process of reform 
in the countries whose economies are in the middle of transition 
must be one of the major lines of action of various European 
structures. This will also lead to the creation of the 
necessary conditions for integration into the European Union. 
The whole process, by emphasizing its economic dimension, can 
lead to the consolidation of European stability, of prosperity 
of all states in our region, and to the creation of the 
appropriate conditions for practicing the rights and fundamental 
liberties of each citizen.

  [Text] Sarajevo, May 30 (AFP) -- The constituent assembly 
of the new Croat-Moslem federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina on 
Monday approved Kresimir Zubak, a Croat, as its president for 
the next six months. His appointment was counterbalanced with 
the naming of Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic, a Moslem, to 
the same office in the new federation. 
  Zubak, who has been the Croat leader since January when he 
replaced the extreme nationalist Mate Boban, is untainted by 
charges of ethnic cleansing against Moslems. A moderate, he was 
chosen by Zagreb to put some order into Croat affairs in 
Hercegovina and to make peace with the Moslems. Haris Silajdzic, 
Bosnia's current prime minister, was nominated premier of the 
new federal government. Croats will occupy six of the 17 
ministerial posts: defence, finance, justice, trade, health and 
one minister with no portfolio. 
  The new federal institutions will not replace the existing 
ones of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, whose president 
remains Alija Izetbegovic, as long as peace negotations with the 
Bosnian Serbs continue. 
  The federation agreement was negotiated in March and April 
in 
Bonn, Vienna and Washington under the auspices of special U.S. 
envoy for ex-Yugoslavia Charles Redman. The new federation is to 
consist of cantons with a high degree of autonomy over 
decisionmaking.

<F P=106> [Speech by Kresimir Zubak, president of the </F>
Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, at the session of the Constituent 
Assembly of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation in Sarajevo on 31 
May -- live] 
  [Text] [Zubak] Ladies and gentlemen, deputies of the 
Constituent Assembly of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, 
esteemed guests, (?members of the) Presidency. As tacit laws, 
that is, good traditions require, I have taken the floor to 
thank you for your trust, and to express -- as is usual in such 
circumstances -- a few thoughts on our current situation and the 
assignments that are before us. We, Croats and Bosniak-Muslims, 
as constituent nations -- including other citizens -- have 
decided to reconstruct Bosnia-Herzegovina into a state entity -- 
the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- based on the absolute 
equality of our peoples, and have given the third, the Serbian 
people, the chance to join us, so that we can build it [the 
Federation] -- observing the highest standard of human rights 
and liberties -- into a democratic community with the highest 
standards known to civilization. Before establishing this, I 
would venture to say ideal, community, as our mutual political 
goal, we have today taken a significant step forward. Many 
[such steps] shall follow, which, due to the still fresh wounds 
inflicted by our sensless conflicts, will always put to the test 
our will and readiness to attain the goal that we have set 
ourselves. Owing to this, we need to remind ourselves 
constantly that, due to our inability to recognize in our 
differences our mutual interests and goals, we have used the 
language of arms instead of using the language of mutual 
deference and tolerance in an attempt to accommodate these 
differences. The most tragic thing is that, even though we are 
all victims, irresponsible individuals and groups -- [words 
indistinct] means and methods -- that could have easily led to 
our identification with the aggressor [who attacked] our 
peoples. We have, thank God, transcended this situation. I 
have stressed this because I am convinced that we have matured 
through this painful experince, and that the second sentence of 
our Constitution -- the rejection of the violence of war -- will 
be a lasting element in our mutual relations. All our problems, 
all conflicts of interest, have to be solved through political 
means in the institutions of the Federation in accordance with 
the procedures and ways established by the Constitution and the 
regulations that we shall adopt. 
  Our peoples are political partners that need to coordinate 
their rights, interests, and needs, at the same time fully 
respecting the right [passage indistinct]. [Words indistinct] 
established our mutual goal and determined the way to achieving 
it, we must in advance be aware that we shall sometimes meet 
with deadlocks on this way. This is normal and commonplace in 
all democratic countries and we must be prepared for such 
situations. Once this happens to us, we should not give in to 
doubts about one another. Instead of riding a wave of 
enthusiasm, we must be sober and patient in building our 
relations, taking into acount [word indistinct], and we need to 
see the community in which we have lived together for centuries 
and in which we must continue living, as a state entity in which 
our differences will be established. [sentence as heard] The 
fervor of brotherhood and unity has unfortunately led us to 
violence. Therefore, in place of fervor, which is the mother of 
both [word indistinct] and imporovizations, I am more inclined 
toward a gradual and patient building of the foundations and the 
framework of our community, because the transitional period is 
-- at least, this is the way I see it -- a period during which 
we need to lay the foundations of our state community. 
Immediately and from this moment on, we must think about mutual 
forgiveness. Ladies and gentlemen, you have electd as president 
of the Federation a man who has never had aspirations to do any 
work involving politics. By (?following) my conscience, I have, 
from the beginning, joined the just, defensive war of my people, 
at the same time attempting to contribute to the affirmation of 
its rights and [word indistinct]. At the same time, I have never 
believed that any rights and interests could or should be 
greater than the rights and interests of the other peoples with 
whom we live in our mutual homeland of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
During this transitional period -- owing more to circumstances 
than my wish -- I have to perform the duties that are of a 
higher political (?nature). I do not know how good a solution 
this is, that a political amateur should be assuming such 
significant duties, particularly since I am trying to coordinate 
my thoughts, words, and deeds, which people claim is not a 
desirable quality in political spheres. To many this may sound 
stereotypical, cordial, and therefore not entirely convincing, 
but I do not know any other way of saying this; you can rest 
assured that I will carry out the duties of president of the 
Federation in the transitional period in accordance with the 
adopted Constitution -- conscientiously and responsibly -- and 
in the interest of our peoples and citizens. Thank you.

<F P=106> [Speech by Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of </F>
Bosnia-Herzegovina, addressing participants in the constituent 
assembly of the B-H Federation in Sarajevo on 30 May -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed deputies, today's session of the 
Constituent Assembly of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
aimed at reaching decisions of great importance for the 
implementation of the constitutional provisions concerning 
executive organs of the federation, the territorial organization 
of the cantons, and other important issues concerning the 
setting up of the system of state organization [words 
indistinct] regarding the adoption of these decisions we are 
running a bit behind the schedule envisaged by the draft 
provisions of the federal constitution. However, we live and 
work under conditions of war, which makes it very difficult 
indeed to solve numerous, very sensitive issues within a short 
period of time, within 30 days or so, and at the same time deal 
with many other issues imposed on us by the incidents of war. 
  Although lately there has been an abundance of events that 
(?pretended) to be that, to be not only important, but also 
historic, there is no doubt that the Washington Agreement and 
the adopted Federation Constitution will find their place among 
these events. In brief, it is in fact these events that mark a 
qualitatively new stage characterized by essentially different 
relations and a much faster pace of development. It is very 
important that we preserve and further develop this new 
qualitatively new component, and at the same time step up the 
dynamics of the process that has begun. 
  The Washington Agreement and the adoption of the Federation 
Constitution represent an exceptionally important breakthrough 
in unblocking relations caused by the aggression. First of all 
there is a shift in the balance of power in the political and 
military spheres, which had significantly shifted to the 
advantage of the aggressor prior to the conclusion of the 
Washington Agreement. 
  The setting up of the Federation has facilitated the 
consolidation of relations between Bosniaks and Croats and the 
unified stand toward aggressive Serbian nationalism. This in 
turn facilitates a strategic change in relations not only in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina but also further afield in the region. At 
this moment this is the only real way to effectively oppose the 
idea of the creation of a great Serbia. This orientation has 
already yielded some results. 
  There were, however, some risks that the process to 
implement 
the Washington Agreement would be blocked. The Vienna Agreement 
had removed that danger and instead of a new blockade, we now 
have an open path to implement the federal Constitution and 
realize the entire political project deriving from the 
Washington Agreement. 
  Proceeding from the standpoints of the Constituent Assembly, 
we have reached concurrence on several very important issues, 
proposals that will enable the assembly to adopt decisions 
needed to definitely realize [word indistinct] the Federation in 
actual life. First, we have agreed on the national composition 
of the incumbents to the federation's executive branch. These 
proposals are already known and there is no need for me to 
repeat them here. The proposals are based on provisions of the 
Federation Constitution and the provisions of the Constitutional 
Law on Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  We bore in mind the fact that in the transitional period, 
within constitutionally determined rights and duties, the 
constitutional organs of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
the organs of the Federation will function simultaneously. 
However, the national composition of the federal incumbents is 
not the only important issue. At this moment it is extremely 
important that the people who are to carry out these duties are 
firmly, sincerely, and personally committed to the consistent 
implementation of the Washington Agreement. Their readiness to 
work resolutely on the implementation of the constitutional 
setup of the Federation as a whole is especially important. 
  It is not redundant to stress that every person proposed 
for these posts from one nation must be acceptable to the other 
nation. Incumbents for federal posts will however not perform 
their duties only for the nation from which they come. They are 
state officials who have constitutional rights, duties, and 
responsibilities toward all peoples and all citizens. It is 
therefore important that they are people who enjoy widespread 
trust. 
  When we were creating conditions for the effective 
implementation of the Constitution of the Federation we also 
(?adopted) proposals for the territorial organization of the 
cantons. This is a very important and sensitive issue. It took 
a considerable amount of patience, effort, and understanding to 
find acceptable solutions. It is in fact this issue that has 
demonstrated that the concept of federation does not lead toward 
rifts and divisions, but that it is opening up opportunities for 
the reintegration of people and regions, respecting at the same 
time the principles of national equality and the rights of the 
Bosniaks and Croats to exercise the constitutional status of 
constituent nations in all parts of the federation. 
  Regarding the Central Bosnian and the Neretva Cantons, one 
should particularly stress that the proposed solutions are such 
that it is in fact these two cantons that, instead of being 
battlefields, can represent the backbone of the Federation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is one of those solutions that is 
strengthening mutual trust among Bosniaks and Croats and 
pointing to the readiness to set up the Federation and develop 
it as a real expression of common, long-term, and vital 
interests of the two peoples. 
  The issue of the territory of the Federation as whole is 
directly connected to the territorial organization of the 
cantons. Full agreement has also been reached on this issue. 
The territory of the Federation is defined according to the 
constitutional principle that the Federation will be set up in 
those areas of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina in which the 
Bosniaks and Croats constitute a majority of the population. 
The territories of the areas defined in this way encompass 55 
percent of the total territory of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Sarajevo region, which makes up another 
3 percent of the republic, is treated in a special way. In the 
transitional period this region would be placed under the 
administrative supervision of the international community and 
the United Nations. 
  According to the map established by the Vienna Agreement, 
there are 2,844,000 people living on the territory of the 
Federation, according to data from 1991. Of these, the Bosniaks 
make up 52.07 percent, the Croats 24.11 percent, the Serbs 16.93 
percent, and members of other nations make up approximately 7 
percent. In relation to the total number of the Bosniaks in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, 77.81 percent of the members of this nation 
are living on the territory of the Federation. Of the total 
number of the Bosnia- Herzegovina Croats, 90.12 percent of them 
live on the territory of the Federation. Of the total number of 
Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 35.25 percent live 
on the territory of the Federation. 
  Of course, one cannot see from the statistical data on 
ethnic 
composition all the components important for the survival and 
functioning of the territorial integrity of the federation. 
However, the analysis of other elements shows that the territory 
of the Federation satisfies the most vital political, economic, 
defense, and other parameters necessary for the realistic 
functioning of the Federation. 
  I would like to stress in particular that the aim of 
creating 
the Federation is not to establish some kind of exclusive space 
for Bosniaks and Croats. On the contrary, I think that this is 
only an important step in the search for a just and lasting 
political solution that will bring peace back to this region, 
and that will enable members of all nations to live free in all 
parts of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and enjoy full 
national equality and all human rights and freedoms. 
  It is in fact for these reasons that our invitation is 
permanently open to the members of the Serbian nation to accept 
the federal concept on the same principles that apply to the 
Bosniaks and the Croats. This is (?fair) proposal that 
represents a reasonable and acceptable alternative to the war 
options. The members of the Serbian nation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina have every reason to react positively to this 
proposal. 
  Esteemed deputies, the decisions that the parliament is 
supposed to adopt today have great importance in the context of 
the peace process that is again gaining pace and intensity with 
the initiatives of the United States, Russia, and the European 
Union. The realization of the Washington and Vienna Agreements 
has already considerably contributed to the removal of the 
imposed notion about three warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
A few day ago, at the meeting with the contact group in France, 
we were formally and essentially one side, a side that 
(?impressed) with its arguments and with constructive proposals 
aimed at achieving a peaceful and just political solution. 
  The implementation of the Constitution of the Federation at 
all levels, and (?organization), will contribute to the further 
strengthening of such [words indistinct]. Of course, one should 
not have any illusions that everything will go smoothly. Before 
us is lies the important political duty of reestablishing mutual 
trust with words and deeds, especially in the regions where past 
events have had serious consequences. For the sake of truth and 
political reality, one should say that there are forces in whose 
interest it is to obstruct and even openly prevent these 
positive efforts. It is our duty to prevent and eliminate these 
extremists, because their existence and activities only serve 
the aggressor and weaken our position. 
  Further (?consolidation) of the situation and relations in 
the Federation in our view means above all a step closer to 
peace. However, if the war option continues to be imposed on us, 
then this is a precondition for our successful resistance 
against aggression. 
  Esteemed Deputies, before this parliament are proposals on 
which it must decide with much prudence, tolerance, and 
political responsibility. By adopting the Constitution of the 
Federation and supporting the Washington Agreement, this 
assembly has already demonstrated these qualities. I believe 
that the executive bodies that will be elected and appointed at 
this session will have the same attitudes toward their future 
duties. This particularly refers to the peace process; the 
strengthening of the defense forces for the struggle against the 
aggressor; the speedy establishment of other entities envisaged 
by the federal constitution, at all levels; the further 
consolidation of the situation on the territory controlled by 
the legislative branch; the creation of conditions for the 
survival of the population in areas particularly affected by the 
war; and especially the care for refugees and displaced persons, 
that is, the creation of conditions for their soonest return to 
the places and homes that they had to leave. 
  I appeal to you to contribute with your decisions to the 
even 
more resolute and successful realization of these principles 
that are of vital importance for every individual, every family, 
and all peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Thank you. [applause]

<F P=106> [Speech by Ejup Ganic, vice president of the </F>
Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, at the session of the Constituent 
Assembly of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation in Sarajevo on 31 
May -- live] 
  [Text] High house, esteemed deputies and representatives! 
I thank you for the trust you have shown in me. 
  My vision of the federation of the Bosniak and the Croatian 
peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina has always been a positive one. 
For me, beside other things, the federation means the 
inescapable and as rapid as possible closure of all trenches 
between the forces of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] and the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. The federation means the opening of all 
communications for free passage of goods, people, and capital. 
The federation means the return of each exiled person to his 
own home. The federation means directing our armed forces and 
all other antifascists forces against the Serbian fascism if a 
just peace cannot be achieved through negotiations. The 
federation means the reanimation of the transportation and 
economic backbone, from Brcko to Neum and from Capljina to the 
Usora River. The federation is the best guarantee for the 
preservation of the internationally recognized borders of our 
country. The establishment of the federation is the biggest 
strategical defeat of the Serbian fascism. This is a Stalingrad 
of the idea of Greater Serbia. 
  The federation means the normalization of all relations 
between our country and the Republic of Croatia and their joint 
international economic cooperation with a great number of 
countries who are Bosnia's friends. The federation is a joint 
historic interest and, let us be frank, also a marriage of 
convenience. Marriages that are based on joint interests, as 
experience shows us, are stable, long-lasting, serious, and 
prosperous. 
  Gentlemen, deputies and representatives! I feel the need to 
also issue a message to the part of the Serbian peoples who 
stood for the Serbian fascism, that is, to the so-called 
Karadzic's Serbs. My message to them is: Condemn the crimes, 
return whatever is not yours, and join the federation. Learn to 
respect human rights, organize your cantons to suit the norms of 
the civilized world if you want to be a part of it. Do not plan 
on bringing up your children on foreign soil, in foreign homes, 
on foreign property. Those who base their future on seized 
property do not have a future. [applause] For this reason, the 
leaders of the czarist Serbian Democratic Council are, en masse, 
buying villas for their children in Cyprus. Remember that any 
type of fascism has always been defeated. This was my message. 
  Gentlemen, deputies and representatives! Wars, sorrows, 
fires, occupations, [word indistinct], and horrors of all sorts 
have ravaged this suffering country of Bosnia. However, Bosnia 
has always survived and, as they say, defiant with dreams, it 
has always resurrected more beautiful and proud than before. On 
us, gathered in this hall, the resurrection of Bosnia greatly 
depends. 
  Finally, I would say something entirely personal, with your 
permission. Whenever I am entrusted with a responsible and 
difficult task, I remember my deceased mother and father who 
taught me to do any job thoroughly and finish it. Thank you! 
[applause]

  [Excerpts] Novi Sad, 29 May (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Srpska republic, spoke in Novi Sad today in the 
capacity of president of the Serb Democratic Party of Serb 
lands. He said that the Serb side would not condition the talks 
on the end of hostilities on the lifting of the sanctions 
against the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. 
  We would like to see peace, even for four months, in order 
to 
save the lives of many young Serb and Muslim men, said Karadzic 
at a news conference. 
  We will not set any conditions for the talks on the end of 
hostilities, but the conference cannot start until the Serb side 
is guaranteed an equal status, which implies that something 
should be done about the sanctions and that the pressure and 
threats of the international community should cease, stressed 
Karadzic. These are the minimum conditions that should show 
whether the international community wants peace or not. 
  Karadzic said that some circles in the United States would 
prefer the sanctions to peace and that some circles in the 
United States maintain "pro-Iranian positions" waging this war 
via a mediator. 
  We believe that the talks about percentages of Bosnian 
territory should be abandoned because they do not reflect the 
structure and quality of these territories. We could accept 49 
percent of former Bosnia-Herzegovina's territory, but in that 
case they [Bosnian Croats and Muslims] should give us Tuzla and 
Sarajevo, said Karadzic. 
  Given that two states are being created in former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, one must take into account the fact that 
they should be capable of functioning with enough resources, a 
good infrastructure and communications, believes Karadzic. 
  We are prepared in this respect to honor the rights of 
Croats 
and Muslims and those of their federation, but we demand the 
same in return -- that our borders can be defended in case we 
become enemies again, and that our territories are compact, 
stressed Karadzic. [passage omitted] 
  It is quite clear, said Karadzic, that the international 
community accepted the fact that the Srpska republic already 
existed in former Bosnia-Herzegovina's territory and that it 
will be recognized, while the remaining territory will be one 
state -- a federation of Muslims and Croats -- or possibly two 
states if the federation fails. 
  In Karadzic's opinion, this is the greatest achievement of 
the four-month political struggle of the Serb people and he 
believes that it would have been better both for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and for The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia to have remained in Yugoslavia. If the international 
community fails to stop the Muslim offensive, the Serb army 
will, at a given moment, launch a counteroffensive, warned 
Karadzic. 
  If our enemies decide that the conflict should be resolved 
by 
military means they must realize that they will get as many 
territories as they succeed in taking -- which means almost 
nothing. If however, they opt for a political solution then we 
Serbs will have to cede some of the territory, but in this case 
the war must stop at once, said Karadzic categorically.

  [Text] The Croatian National Council of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
at today's meeting again expressed its full support for the 
Washington Agreement, the Vienna talks, and the Constitution 
passed by the Federal Assembly. 
  The Croatian National Council does not see the federation as 
a transitional phase that threatens to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina 
in recognition of the results of the genocide, but as a 
departing point for the preservation of territorial integrity 
and the sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina within internationally 
recognized borders. In this sense, the Croatian National Council 
categorically rejects any kind of negotiations about a corridor 
through the Bosnian Sava Basin because this fundamentally 
undermines the federation and the integrity of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Croatian National Council is also opposed to the 
division 
of the territory at the ratio of 51 to 49 because in this way 
the greater parts of the Bosnian Sava Basin, Bosnian Krajina, 
the Jajce region, and others where the Croatian and the Bosniak 
majority had existed would be lost to Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Croatian National Council of Bosnia-Herzegovina [word 
indistinct] deputies of the Croatian and Bosniak peoples, to -- 
keeping in mind their political and historic responsibility 
before their own people -- deny their voice to the solutions 
that would run contrary to the Croatian National Council's 
abovementioned stance or the results of the 1990 and 1992 
elections, which bind them to the preservation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on the basis of equality of the three 
constituent peoples.

  [Excerpt] The chamber of deputies of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna at its session in Mostar today endorsed the 
Washington and Vienna Agreements, assessing them as being a 
historical necessity, but also as being an acceptable solution 
for the Croat nation. The deputies concluded that by their 
consistent implementation, and through the confederation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia, equal rights and 
survival of the Croat nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina are being 
secured. Zdenko Vranjes has a report on other conclusions 
reached by the chamber of deputies of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna: 
  [Begin Vranjes recording] In addition to its support for the 
Vienna negotiations, following a day-long discussion, the 
chamber of deputies instructed the deputies of this chamber who 
are to be present at the constitutive assembly session of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina federation in Sarajevo on Monday [30 May], to 
vote only for the election of the president and the vice 
president of the federation in line with the Vienna Agreement, 
while other decisions on the agenda should be voted for only if 
they are in accordance with the adopted constitution of the 
federation. 
  This conclusion was endorsed in order to postpone the 
adoption of a law on the federal government, because deputies 
who took part in the discussion said that the draft law was not 
completely coordinated with the adopted constitution. 
Therefore, the deputies were advised to discuss the draft law 
at the constitutive assembly session on Monday and return it to 
be further coordinated with the constitution. 
  Even though the agenda of the constitutive assembly session 
on Monday does not include the decisionmaking on the final 
cantonal set-up of the federation, the chamber of deputies, in 
addition to its positive assessment of this part of the Vienna 
Agreement, instructed the deputies, when making a decision on 
this issue, to take into consideration all constructive 
proposals, opinions, and suggestions of the Croat people voiced 
at the session today. 
  The chamber of deputies endorsed a stand of the leadership 
of 
the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia-Herzegovina that was 
presented in the discussion today that scope and opportunities 
still existed for making alterations to the agreed maps of 
cantons. 
  All these conclusions, even though read out, were not 
formally endorsed because Mostar was left without electricity 
this evening and the session was wound up for that reason. 
  Before that, the chamber of deputies positively assessed the 
work of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government so far, as it was 
said, given the conditions under which it has been working. 
  The deputies decided that the Defense Ministry and the main 
HVO [Croatian Defense Council] headquarters should begin 
demobilization, advising the government to invest more effort 
into the reconstruction of the economy. [passage omitted] [end 
recording]

  [Text] Zagreb, May 29 (AFP) -- The self-declared Bosnian 
Croat parliament has given qualified backing to an accord 
providing for a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia, the Croatian 
news agency HINA said Sunday [29 May]. 
  At a meeting Saturday in the southern Bosnian city of 
Mostar, 
the parliament endorsed the federation plan as an "historic 
necessity" dictated by "internal and foreign policy realities." 
But it made its backing subject to the Croats in Bosnia being 
afforded equal rights and the federation being liked in a 
confederation with Croatia. Croatian Defence Minister Gojko 
Susak, who attended the assembly's debate, said "without a 
confederation, there can be no federation." 
  The meeting came ahead of a session in Sarajevo on Monday of 
a constituent assembly to elect a Croat president, a Moslem 
vice-president and a Moslem prime minister for the federation in 
accordance with an agreement reached May 11 in Vienna. 
  Under the latest international peace plan for Bosnia, the 
federation is to cover 51 percent of Bosnian territory. The 
Moslems and Croats have said they want 58 percent. The Bosnian 
Serbs currently hold 70 percent. The Vienna accord foresees the 
creation of four Moslem, two Croat and two mixed cantons. The 
mixed areas in central and southern regions of the country will 
be jointly administered, but this has upset local Croats, 
especially in Mostar. Croat inhabitants complain the canton 
including Mostar includes the Catholic pilgrimage site of 
Medjugorje. 
  Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has said Mostar should 
underline its Croat identity. "Mostar should be the home of the 
main Croat institutions. It should have a Croat university, a 
Croat theatre, a Croat fotball club." The Croats also want to 
keep their Croatian currency, the kuna, in Bosnia as added 
evidence of their ethnic identity. The federation accord 
provides for a Bosnian federation currency under central 
government control.

  [Text] Following the completion of the work of the Main 
Committee of the Party of Democratic Action [SDA], Party 
Chairman Alija Izetbegovic made the following statement for 
public information media: 
  [Begin Izetbegovic recording] A session of the SDA Main 
Committee has just ended. There were 124 people in attendance, 
who were not only members of the Main Committee; there were a 
number of deputies to the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly, a session 
of which will be held on 30 May. There was also a number 
of...[pauses] They are [word indistinct] members of the 
proclamation (?of the 40); that is the proclamation that was 
issued on 27 March 1990 in the same room where today's session 
was held. 
  The Main Committee was convened at this time for two 
reasons: 
First, to mark four years of work of the party whose founding 
assembly was held precisely four years ago, on 26 May 1990. 
Second, to prepare our stances for the upcoming session of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly which is to begin on Monday. 
Regarding the first issue--marking the anniversary--as you can 
see, there have been no celebrations. We do not believe it is 
appropriate to have celebrations at this time. Everything ended 
in [words indistinct] to put it in that way, and [word 
indistinct] for those missing and killed. Killed soldiers and 
[words indistinct]. Regarding the other issue, preparations for 
the assembly, I can say that our attention was focused on three 
topics: First, the Vienna negotiations that have just concluded, 
then talks in the south of France, in Talloires, and finally our 
candidates for the post in the future federation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. This coincides with the agenda for the 
Assembly session. 
  Speaking about the Vienna Agreement, support was given to 
the 
conclusions reached in Vienna. [Words indistinct] pessimists 
who thought that it would be impossible to implement the 
(?Washington) and Vienna Agreements have been proved wrong. A 
big step has been made toward solving some of the delicate 
issues, primarily the maps of the cantons that were the main 
problem, and the problem of sharing the positions in the 
federation. Hence, congratulations to the delegation, the three 
people who went to Vienna--Silajdzic, Ganic, and Bicakcic--on 
the work they did in Vienna and in the French town of Talloires. 
  As is known, this second meeting in France dealt with 
relations with the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina, practically with 
the external borders of the future federation (?within a 
unitary) Bosnia-Herzegovina. We can say, this is the conclusion 
of the Main Committee, that the meeting achieved what was 
expected. The meeting was not part of the negotiations, 
but--let me say--it was a mutual testing ground. Our people 
went there without [words indistinct], and I think that they 
came back better informed [words indistinct]. 
  Finally, speaking about candidates, I put forward a 
proposal, 
which was accepted, that our candidates for the two key 
positions in the future federation--vice president and prime 
minister--be Ejup Ganic for the position of vice president and 
Haris Silajdzic for the position of prime minister. 
  Finally, I can say that today [words indistinct] my personal 
impression is that is was very useful. That was an open (?point 
of the agenda) during which members of the Main Committee who 
came from Germany, Croatia, and all parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
could put forward their impressions about the situation among 
our people in Germany, which some people call 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's big canton because there are about 200,000 
to 300,000 of our people there. We heard very interesting 
comments about our [word indistinct] there and about the work of 
the party. Many topics were addressed and discussed in that 
context. This is all I can tell you for the time being. [end

  [Text] The offers conveyed to us by the members of the 
contact group that concerned the territorial division were not 
meant to impose a solution, but to merely mediate. This is what 
Momcilo Krajisnik, chairman of the peoples' assembly of the 
Srpska republic, stated for the SRNA news agency after the talks 
with the contact group for former Bosnia-Herzegovina in the 
French town of Talloires. 
  According to him, during this meeting the Serbian 
negotiating 
team pointed at the harmful effects of the provision that 
stipulates the territorial division of 51 against 49 percent and 
emphasized that this cannot be discussed in advance. We believe 
that percentages, without taking into account the quantity and 
the quality of territories, mean nothing. The members of the 
contact group acknowledged this with understanding, Krajisnik 
pointed out. He added that nothing qualitative and new has been 
accomplished regarding the finding of a solution to the crisis. 
  It is also characteristic of this meeting, Krajisnik 
specified, that the members of the contact group wanted to hear 
new ideas and proposals of the Serbian side to convey them to 
the governments of their countries. We have pointed at the 
problems that we have been encountering lately and the Croatian 
and Muslim side not being willing to accept the end of 
hostilities, which definitely increases tensions on the 
territory of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Krajisnik emphasized 
and added: 
  We are encouraged by the fact that the contact group has 
acknowledged our view that the most important task is to end 
hostilities. The group has promised to mediate for as quick as 
possible establishment of peace with the Muslims and the Croats. 
  In the opinion of the chairman of the assembly of the Srpska 
republic, the meeting in Talloires can under no circumstance be 
called negotiations, bearing in mind the platform of the 
peoples' assembly of the Srpska republic according to which 
there can be no continuation of the talks until the Serbian side 
has received an equal treatment and the sanctions have been 
lifted. 
  We will need to invest many more efforts as there is a 
difficult battle ahead of us before the final solution. The 
differences in opinions are great and, with some of their 
radical statements, the Muslims are making the achievement of 
the final agreement more remote, Krajisnik said after the talks 
in Talloires, SRNA reports.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 27 May (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, 
president of the Srpska republic's national assembly, said that 
the participants in the Talloires meeting examined the positions 
and stands of the sides in the Bosnian conflict and noted the 
problems, that opinions were exchanged, and that "the complete 
material will nevertheless, be reviewed at the conference on 
former Yugoslavia, also attended by cochairmen Owen and 
Stoltenberg." 
  Summing up the two-day talks in Talloires at this evening's 
news conference for domestic reporters, Krajisnik also said: "We 
specifically discussed western and eastern Bosnia and the 
Posavina issue, and we elaborated on the vital importance of 
these regions for the Serb population in Bosnia." 
  "The fact that the Muslims want to acquire huge chunks of 
western Bosnia and the entire Posavina region remains a bone of 
contention. They want to include the Sanski Most, Prijedor, 
Kljuc, Doboj, Brcko, Zvornik, and Visegrad areas in the 
so-called gray zone that will be undefined and whose status will 
be resolved sometime in the future," Krajisnik said, and added: 
"We objected that sheer quantity meant nothing and that 1 
percent of Tuzla or Sarajevo was worth more than 3 percent of 
some other territory. There were no definitive conclusions, so 
the Contact Group will have a hard time finding adequate 
solutions," he believes. 
  Krajisnik believes that the most important effect of the 
negotiations was produced by the Contact Group's genuine desire 
to broker a lasting cessation of hostilities, although he voiced 
his skepticism regarding the finding of a political solution by 
the present participants represented in the Contact Group. 
  "We were informed that the Muslim delegation was rejecting 
all offers, demanding a large percentage of the territory, and 
constantly laying claims to the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
which only makes chances for a peaceful resolution more remote," 
Krajisnik said. 
  "We clearly said and explained that we had vital interests 
in 
the regions of eastern Bosnia, Posavina, and parts of Sarajevo 
and I think that our position was fully appreciated, so I could 
say that the Talloires meeting was successful, because we also 
had a series of individual meetings with members of the Contact 
Group," Krajisnik said. 
  "The Contact Group members did not bring a map to the 
meeting, so we worked on territorial issues in segments, 
although the Muslim demands were perfectly clear to us. I do 
not know whether any solutions will be imposed, but we 
unambiguously made it known that we will not accept any imposed 
solutions. It should be determined in the case of disputed 
territories whose interests are greater in relation to the 
disputed territory," Krajisnik said, stressing that no pressure 
had been exerted on the Serb delegation this time. 
  The Srpska republic's national assembly president underlined 
that the Serb delegation had informed the Contact group about 
the current Muslim offensive, emphasizing that the Muslim side 
was warned that the Serbs will defend themselves and respond to 
attacks by launching counteroffensives, but the lasting 
orientation of the Bosnian Serbs was the establishment of a 
cessation of hostilities. 
  "The international community, however, is not unanimous in 
the desire to stop the conflict in former Bosnia-Herzegovina," 
Krajisnik said. ``They forced themselves into adopting a 
unified stand, but this has already proved to be a sham because 
certain important factors are not in favor of the peace option, 
although there are countries strongly advocating an end to the 
war. The Muslims are exploiting this, they are behaving 
arrogantly, completely unrealistically, and they are resorting 
to blackmail as if the entire international community was on 
their side. 
  "My impression is that the Muslims do not want the war to 
end, which could certainly result in an escalation of the 
conflict," Momcilo Krajisnik concluded at this evening's news 
conference for domestic reporters.

  [Text] Sarajevo, May 31 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb forces seized 
back control of a cannon that was under UN supervision in the 
exclusion zone around Sarajevo "in violation" of the NATO 
ultimatum, a UN military spokesman said Tuesday. The 105-mm. 
artillery gun was at a site where heavy weapons had been rounded 
up in Krivoglavci, in a Serb-controlled zone northwest of 
Sarajevo, said Major Rob Annink, spokesman for the UN Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR). The site was a designated "weapon collection 
point" within the 20 kilometer (12-miles) exclusion zone for 
heavy arms imposed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
around the capital, he said. 
  UNPROFOR "immediately" contacted the Bosnian Serb military 
headquarters in Lukavica, a southwestern Sarajevo suburb, which 
said the cannon had been taken Monday at "the initiative of a 
local commander," according to the major. The Serb command said 
they would investigate the incident. A UN forces patrol noticed 
the weapon was missing early Monday evening. "It's a violation 
of the ultimatum" ordered by NATO to neutralize the Sarajevo 
zone under threat of air strikes. He also said that UNPROFOR was 
trying to consolidate the number of weapon collection points to 
facilitate monitoring. 
  In another incident, Serb forces Tuesday were holding five 
people including a UN employee they detained around midday 
Monday at a Serb checkpoint at Kasindolska on the road to 
Sarajevo airport, the major said. He said UNPROFOR was 
negotiating to try to obtain their release, identifying the 
other four as a local employee of the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR), and three local people with "a press card." 
  The situation was unchanged in the rest of the country, with 
fighting continuing in the Travnik region in western Bosnia 
where the mainly Moslem Bosnian army was trying to take control 
of a strategic Serb-held hill overlooking the city, the Vlasic 
plateau. "We have reports of fierce artillery fighting in the 
area of Donji Vakuf and Prusac," southest of Travnik, the 
spokesman said. Annink said there were also reports of eight 
shots from Serb tanks in the area of the strategic Brcko 
corridor against the village of Brka, a Bosnian Moslem position 
to the south. The Serbs are trying to gain control of the 
corridor, barely three kilometers (1.5 miles) wide at its 
narrowest point, to link territories they have won in Croatia 
and northwestern Bosnia with their conquests in eastern Bosnia 
right up to Serbia. Fighting was also reported in Mostar in the 
south. 
  On Monday, UNPROFOR said the UN-controlled Tuzla airport in 
the northeast was shelled as Serb forces counter-attacked in 
northern Bosnia in a bid to halt a push westwards by the 
Moslem-dominated Bosnian army. In Gorazde, southeast of the 
capital, UN workers are still facing "restrictions" of their 
freedom of movement in certain areas inside the 20-kilometer 
exclusion zone around the city. Shots were fired at a team of 
UN engineers there without anyone getting hurt, but the source 
of the fire could not be determined, the spokesman said. A UNHCR 
spokesman said no aid convoy had yet managed to reach the 
southern part of the Moslem enclave at Bihac in the west since 
May 17.

  [Text] Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina, May 30 (AFP) -- Bosnia's 
Tuzla-Dubrave airport, which is under UN protection, came under 
heavy shelling Monday [30 May], a United Nations Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) officer said. 
  "We're being shelled, we're on red alert and everyone is in 
the shelters," the duty officer at the airport, some 20 
kilometres (12 miles) south-east of the town of Tuzla, told AFP 
by telephone. 
  The attack began a litle before 2.00 P.M. (1230 GMT), the 
schedule time of arrival for one of two daily UNPROFOR flights 
into the airport.

  [Text] Sarajevo, May 30 (AFP) -- The UN-controlled Tuzla 
airport came under heavy shellfire Monday as the UN reported 
Serb forces counter-attacking in north-central Bosnia in a bid 
to halt a push westwards by the Moslem-dominated Bosnian army. A 
spokesman for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) contacted by 
telephone said the airport was hit twice by large calibre 
shells, though there were no reports of casualties or damage. 
"We're being shelled, we're on red alert and everyone is in the 
shelters," the duty officer at the airport, some 20 kilometres 
(12 miles) southeast of Tuzla, in northeastern Bosnia, told AFP 
by telephone. 
  Although UNPROFOR did not say which side was responsible for 
the attack, a military source told AFP: "The Serbs said Monday 
[30 May] morning that they could not guarantee safety at the 
airport today." Meanwhile, in a statement issued in Zagreb, UN 
special envoy Yasushi Akashi condemned the "raising of military 
tension" in the area of the Posavina corridor, a strip of 
Serb-controlled territory running across northern Bosnia. 
  Exchanges of fire at the end of last week appeared to have 
originated from Serb-controlled areas south and southeast of the 
Orasje pocket, UNPROFOR said. Bosnian Croat and Bosnian 
government forces then replied by shelling Brcko, which was 
already the target of shelling between 10 and 23 May, it went 
on. The targetting of civilian sectors is "a crime under 
international law and must cease," Akashi warned. 
  Some 30 kilometres (20 miles) east of Tuzla, the Serbs have 
launched a major offensive, Colonel Ekrem Avdic, spokesman for 
the Bosnian Army Second Corps, said. In the north-central region 
around Tesanj and Teslic, Serb forces are trying to regain 
ground lost during a Bosnian army offensive south-west of 
Tesanj, UNPROFOR's Sarajevo spokesman Major Rob Annink said. 
Over the past week, the Bosnian army captured all the heights 
overlooking the Serb-controlled town of Teslic, Annink said. 
The Serbs began "retaliating with artillery on civilian areas" 
on Sunday [29 May], he added. Annink said government commanders 
had concentrated troops in the region over the past weeks in 
preparation for an offensive. Their objective appeared to be to 
take over the Vlasic plateau which dominates Travnik in order 
"to control the road to Donji Vakuf and probably move downwards" 
to the south, he said. Serb forces were also counter-attacking 
about 80 kilometres (50 miles) south of the region, around Turbe 
and Travnik, Annink said. 
  General Rasim Delic, commander in chief of Bosnian armed 
forces, told a local daily recently that he thought conditions 
were ripe for liberating seven towns, including Teslic and Donji 
Vakuf. In north-eastern Bosnia, the Serbs are "using artillery 
and tanks," with the probable objective of cutting the road to 
Teocak, said Avdic, who was speaking in Tuzla. Teocak, a village 
devasted by the fighting, is at the extreme north of the "Sapna 
finger," a sector controlled by the Bosnians which commands 
access to the Posavina corridor. 
  Control of the Posavina corridor, barely three kilometres 
wide at its narrowest point, allows the Serbs, via the town of 
Brcko, to link the territories they have won in Croatia and 
northwestern Bosnia with their conquests in eastern Bosnia right 
up to Serbia. "The enemy is concentrating troops in the region 
of Posavina. We think they are going to try something because 
they don't want a political agreement," Avdic said. Akashi last 
week called the Bosnian government and Serb sides to peace talks 
Thursday and Friday in Geneva.

  [Text] Since 0430 Gradacac has been [word indistinct] 
explosions [words indistinct] and Barice. From all directions 
and all types of arms the aggressor has been literally showering 
the defense lines and the settlements on the free territory. It 
is hard to distinguish and enumerate all the chetnik strongholds 
from which mortars, tanks, guns, and howitzers are [word

  From Gornje Krecane 82-mm and 120-mm mortars and two tanks 
are attacking toward Novalici, while 155-mm howitzers fired more 
than 20 grenades at the town center. These attacks are still 
under way. 
  There is no peace in Pozarike, Begov Konak, [word 
indistinct], and Jukici. The positions of our defenders are 
under constant attacks from antiaircraft machine guns, 
antiaircraft guns, mortars, and all types of infantry arms. 
(?The newly arrived) forces of the Serbian aggressor [words 
indistinct] their tasks, however, they do not dare to attack 
with infantry. Demonstration of power with the artillery 
attacks on civilian targets is characteristic of the criminals 
of the Karadzic's army. 
  At the time of sending this report, battles on the access 
roads to Gradacac continue. The enemy has so far fired more than 
400 projectiles and the day that is dawning is bringing new 
uncertainties that are probably characteristic only for this 
battlefield. For the time being we hold no information on 
possible casualties and injured. The lines are firm and stable.

<F P=106> [Report by Rahija Mesic from the Press Center of the 7th </F>
Army Corps] 
  [Text] [words indistinct] tanks, the Chetniks in this 
region are also using chemical agents in order to lessen the 
combat strength of our units. After they had used chemical 
agents several times, they launched infantry attacks, which, as 
in the past, were futile and unsuccessful. Unable to realize 
their intentions, the Chetniks shelled civilian facilities 
according to their old scenario, though not as intensively as in 
the past few days. 
  The aggressor has used all the available weapons in the 
offensive on our defense lines. Fresh forces are coming from 
the so-called Yugoslavia. This is evident from the mobilization 
calls sent via the aggressor's media. The media reports that 
brothers from Nis will help (?these) Serbs in liberating Serbian 
territories. To what extent the aggressor considers important 
the regions of Bugojno, Turbe, and Vlasic is evident from the 
fact that it has issued mobilization calls to women. The 
Serbian media is devoting most space to appeals for blood 
donors. This is the best illustration of the losses that the 
Golden Lilies of the 7th Corps of the Army of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina have inflicted on them.

  [Text] New York, May 27 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslem 
offensive operations in central and northern Bosnia have 
triggered clashes with the Serbs in the areas of Maglaj, Olovo 
and Gradacac, U.N. spokesman for peacekeeping operations Fred 
Eckhard said at a regular press briefing on Friday. 
  There is fighting also around Bihac in the west, where Serb 
forces are supposed to be attacking, Eckhard went on to say. 
  He explained that talks were still in progress on the 
withdrawal of Bosnian Serbs from the exclusion zone around 
Gorazde in the southeast, but so far without any concrete 
results. He noted there was no deadline or ultimatum for the 
withdrawal. 
  Earlier this year, Moslem forces had mounted a strong 
offensive from Gorazde, which should have been demilitarized a 
year ago together with five other U.N.-designated safe areas in 
Bosnia. When the offensive was on the verge of collapse, the 
international community stepped in and ordered air strikes 
against the Serbs. 
  Bosnian Moslem ambassador to the United Nations Muhamed 
Sacirbej has written to the U.N. Security Council, accusing 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali of putting an equation 
mark between the Bosnian Moslems and Serbs. 
  Sacirbej took exception to Butrus-Ghali's blaming both the 
Serbs and the Moslems for failing to honour their undertakings 
in connection with the safe area of Gorazde, and called for 
bombing the Serbs who he said understand only the language of 
threats and force. 
  Sacirbej explained that the cease-fire agreement for 
Gorazde, 
reached in Belgrade in mid-April by Bosnian Serb President 
Radovan Karadzic and the U.N. secretary-general's special envoy 
Yasushi Akashi, was not binding on the Moslem side which had not 
taken part in the talks.

  [Text] Bijeljina, 27 May (TANJUG) -- It has been learned 
from the press center of the eastern Bosnian corps of the army 
of the Srpska republic that Muslim forces launched an all-out 
offensive on Mt. Majevica this morning. 
  From the direction of Drijenca, Humci, Nahvioci, Brnik, 
Vrazici, and Teocak, Muslim forces launched an artillery attack 
on Serb positions and civilian targets in Priboj, Vukosavci, and 
Lopare. A tank attack was launched around 0900 and about 100 
shells were fired on these targets. A school, a church, and a 
farm in Priboj were attacked by Muslim forces and two civilians 
were wounded. 
  At around 1000, Muslim forces supported by heavy artillery 
launched an all-out infantry attack on Banj Brdo, Stolice, 
Piperi, and Spasojevici. The Serb defense forces energetically 
repelled the completely unprovoked attack and inflicted huge 
losses upon the enemy. 
  Being unable to launch an infantry breakthrough, in the 
early 
afternoon the Muslim forces started shelling Banj Brdo, Stolice, 
and civilian targets around Lopare. 
  The defense lines have not changed and there have been no 
casualties among the Serb fighters.

  [Text] The heaviest fighting in former Bosnia-Herzegovina 
in the past 24 hours was on the Donji Vakuf [Srbobran] front 
where Muslim forces are trying to break through the defense 
lines of the Srpska republic. Slavisa Zabic reports: 
  [Zabic] The strongest offensive of the Bugojno Muslims so 
far 
has been going on for three days now. Hundreds of shells of all 
calibers have hit villages around Srbobran and the city itself, 
in which civilian targets came under fire today. Very strong 
and exceptionally well armed Muslim forces, accompanied by -- as 
Serb military sources report -- many foreign mercenaries 
yesterday captured Serb villages on the Goles plateau on Mount 
Komar and razed them to the ground. Today however, the Serb 
fighters are repelling the assaults by Izetbegovic's extremists, 
the most powerful so far on the Srbobran battlefield. Both 
sides have many dead and wounded in the fighting which is 
gaining impetus hour by hour. 
  In addition to Srbobran, the final aim of the Muslim 
offensive on this part of the battlefield of the Srpska republic 
is Jajce. This is why a fresh regrouping of the enemy forces 
was observed today on roads west of Bugojno.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Members of the Council of Bosnian 
Posavina, deputies from that area, and members of the Croat 
National Council of Bosnian Posavina had a meeting in Sarajevo 
today. Army General Rasim Delic, commander of the supreme 
command headquarters of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, spoke about 
the current military (situation) in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
Bosnian Posavina. Mladen Bosnjak has a report. 
  [Bosnjak] As Rifad (Semulabegovic), president of the Council 
of Bosnian Posavina, said in an introductory speech, the aim of 
the meeting of people from Posavina is to adopt conclusions on 
the eve of tomorrow's session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
assembly. They want to define the relationship of the 
federation's assembly with Posavina. [passage omitted] 
  At the beginning of his speech, Army General Rasim Delic 
stressed that the balance of military power in Posavina is such 
that the aggressor, although technically incomparably superior, 
cannot do much to change the front lines. Regardless of the 
possibility of winning, Bosnia-Herzegovina Army units will not 
launch attacks on the technically superior aggressor and 
sacrifice its' people. However, they will use any opportunity to 
capture territory that is strategically very important for the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. He gave examples of having captured 
the strategically important locations such as Vijenac on Mt. 
Ozren and some locations on Mt. Vlasic. Speaking about the 
military aspect of severing the corridor near Brcko, Mr. Delic 
said: 
  [Begin Delic recording] The army headquarters has made an 
official statement, I hope that our political bodies will uphold 
it, that if the Security Council discusses the protected area it 
will only speak about the protected zone of the free territory 
of Brcko, not of Serb-held Brcko. To protect Brcko is to protect 
the occupation. The deployment of the observers on the Serb side 
is a trap for us because they will monitor our activities. They 
wanted to ensure that if we start attacking, then we will be 
accused. [passage indistinct] 
  Yesterday I had specific talks with Croat General Petkovic 
to 
see what interest the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] has to take 
part in [word indistinct] Bosnian Posavina. Bosnian Posavina 
does not belong only to the Muslims or the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army. 
  In the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army there are Muslims as well as 
people of other nationalities. We must find common ground.

  [Excerpts] Subotica, 28 May (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the republic of Srpska and of the Serb Democratic 
Party [SDS], speaking in Subotica today said that the leadership 
of the Srpska republic will not sign any documents unless the 
abolition of the unfair sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro 
was given a priority treatment. 
  Karadzic was speaking at the founding assembly of the SDS 
Municipal Committee in Subotica today. Bogoljub Zelen was 
elected the committee's first chairman. The founding assembly 
was attended by Velibor Ostojic, chairman of the SDS Executive 
Committee, and numerous guests from town in Vojvodina where 
branches of this party already exist. [passage omitted] 
  Speaking about the republic of Srpska and the current 
situation, Karadzic said that during the coming talks "part of 
the territories will have to be ceded, but either the Srpska 
Assembly or the people at a referendum will decide which ones 
and how many." When the war is over the Serb people will have 
the least reasons to feel ashamed. Many crimes they did not 
commit have been attributed to them. Everyone knows who 
committed them and when and which units were involved, said 
Karadzic who spent three and a half hours in a packed hall of 
the Open University replying to numerous questions about the 
organization of a future state and the ties between the republic 
of Srpska and Serbia.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 30 (TANJUG) -- The inflation has for 
three months been nearly at zero in Yugoslavia 
(Serbia/Montenegro), which in 1993 set the world record with its 
annual inflation rate of 116 trillion per cent. The inflation 
rate in May was 0.3 per cent down from April, Mirjana Rankovic, 
deputy general manager of the Federal Bureau of Statistics said 
on Monday. This has primarily resulted from a further decline of 
retail prices of manufactured goods. Prices of agricultural 
produce have increased 20.5 per cent and those of services 1.8 
per cent, she said. In the past month most of the prices have 
been stable or have slightly declined, but the statistics has, 
nevertheless, registered an increase in prices of some products. 
There has been a record-high increase of the price of carrots -- 
88 per cent -- and apples -- 69 per cent. This is a seasonal 
price increase and its stabilization is expected with a better 
supply of these goods in markets in the weeks to come, Rankovic 
said. The retail prices dropped 6.7 per cent in May and 0.4 per 
cent in April. The living costs were 0.9 per cent down on April, 
although the food costs, which largely influence them, increased 
3.6 per cent. However, this was counterbalanced by a 4.2 per 
cent decline in the prices of clothes and manufactured goods. 
  Rankovic did not want to make any estimates regarding the 
inflation rate in the months to come, but she confirmed that the 
weekly monitoring of prices showed that food prices are 
stabilizing and that there is a further decline in the prices of 
manufactured goods. In late January, when the record-high 
inflation rate of 313 per cent per month was registered, the 
Yugoslav Government began the implementation of the programme of 
monetary reconstruction and economic recovery. The new economic 
measures have curbed the growth of price and recovered 
production, which was on the verge of a breakdown because of the 
international sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia in late May 1992.

  [Text] Podgorica, 16 May 1994 -- Owing to a project made 
possible by the OTE, the Greek Telecommunications Organization, 
Montenegro and Yugoslavia will not remain a desert island in the 
"sea" of international telecommunications. A part of the $3.5 
million equipment for digital radio-relay connections, which had 
been bought by Montenegro from the Italian company 
"Alcatel-Teletra" before the sanctions were introduced, will be 
delivered to Montenegro via Greece. Beginning from September 
1996, Montenegro should have an underwater connection from Bar, 
through Durres and Corfu, to the whole world. 
  This is the result of the agreement achieved in Salonika and 
Athens between the Yugoslav and Montenegrin PTT and the 
representatives of the Greek telecommunication service. In 
Salonika, Vucic Cagorovic, the Yugoslav PTT general manager, 
Milorad Jaksic, the Serbian PTT general manager, and Jusuf 
Fetahovic, the Montenegrin PTT general manager, concluded the 
work of expert groups from both countries. 
  There followed a meeting of expert groups in Athens, led by 
Jusuf Fetahovic and Petros Labron, the OTE general manager, in 
which the agreement was reached that Montenegro should be 
included in every project for optic cables planned for the 
Adriatic. 
  Experts consider that the $30 million investment in the 
radio-relay and optic cables project will be the most profitable 
investment in Montenegro. Therefore it is considered that this 
historic endeavor will be fervently supported by the Montenegrin 
Government, especially if we know that both Montenegro and the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would profit from it because this 
would enable them to become linked to the international 
communication network. Otherwise they would not only be cut off 
from the world and deprived of the possibility of following 
scientific achievements in this field, but they would also lose 
an important income in hard currency. 
  Taking into consideration all parameters, this will be the 
most profitable ecological and tourist undertaking in the 
ecological state of Montenegro [as published].

  [Text] Belgrade, 31 May (TANJUG) -- Special Russian envoy 
Vitaliy Churkin, who arrived in Belgrade this morning on a new 
peace mission, met Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. 
  It has not been officially announced what they discussed, 
but 
it is known that Churkin's mission is linked with the upcoming 
meeting on the crisis in former [as received] Bosnia-Herzegovina 
on 2 and 3 June in Geneva, convened by UN special envoy Yasushi 
Akashi. 
  TANJUG has learned from reliable sources that after the 
talks 
with Milosevic, Churkin will have meetings with the leaders of 
the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] and the Srpska republic. 
  President Milan Martic and Prime Minister Borislav Mikelic, 
who are heading the RSK delegation, will hold talks with Churkin 
in the Russian Embassy on the resumption of the talks with 
Croatia. 
  Churkin arrived in Belgrade from Zagreb where he obviously 
did not conclude his mission because, as AFP reports, he will 
return to the Croatian capital this evening to hold talks with 
President Franjo Tudjman.

<F P=106> [Report by Zoran Glisovic from Kragujevac] </F>
  [Text] In reply to the question they were asked by the 
host of today's "Hallmark of Time" program on Kragujevac Radio, 
leaders of several parliamentary opposition parties 
categorically said that the unification of opposition parties is 
out of the question. 
  Vojislav Seselj said that such a thing is impossible as the 
Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO] and the Serbian Radical Party 
[SRS] have a different approach to the solutions to the national 
issue. According to Seselj, [SPO leader] Vuk Draskovic and he 
have only met in order to agree on a joint approach against [FRY 
Assembly Citizens Chamber Chairman] Radoman Bozovic. In this 
connection, Seselj expressed the hope that Slobodan Milosevic 
will make a step forward and replace Bozovic and threatened that 
if he does not do so, Milosevic himself may be [words 
indistinct]. Immediately afterwards, Seselj said that the 
Radicals do not like violence, but that they also do not like to 
be harassed by others. Considering what he claimed to be a 
parliamentary impasse, Seselj said that there is a possibility 
of holding elections at the federal level by the end of the year. 
  The SPO's Milan Komnenic was most direct in his reply to the 
question on unification, saying that the SPO and the SRS are not 
so much as getting closer to one another and having any joint 
approaches, let alone anything else. He added that what was 
involved was the SPO proffering protection to a parliamentary 
party, in this case the SRS, which was denied a democratic 
expression. The fact that the leaders of these parties, until 
yesterday fierce opponents, have met, does not have to mean love. 
  The Democratic Party, as Zoran Djindjic said, does not 
support any unification among opposition parties as they all 
have different programs. We, for instance, are critical of the 
U.S. policy toward Yugoslavia, he pointed out, and some others 
flirt with it. As regards the walking out of or boycotting 
assembly sessions, the Democratic Party does not accept that 
because, Djindjic pointed out, we have not been elected not to 
attend assembly debates, but, on the contrary, to fight for our 
stands and for changing things to the better.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Prompted by the statements of 
the Bulgarian foreign minister and the increasing presence of 
articles in certain media in Bulgaria, the Federal Government 
reviewed the position of the Bulgarian minority in the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]. It was concluded that an official 
document of the FRY Government should be prepared and submitted 
to the Human Rights Commission in Geneva. It was stressed at 
the session that 25,000 Bulgarians, mainly living in 
Dimitrovgrad and Bosilegrad, enjoy all the individual and 
collective rights that are stipulated by our Constitution and 
the highest international standards. The only children's 
magazine that is published in the language of an ethnic minority 
and that is financed by the federal state is a magazine in the 
Bulgarian language. Two-thirds of the deputies in the 
Dimitrovgrad communal assembly are Bulgarian. This is how Prime 
Minister Kontic assessed the broaching of the issue of the 
Bulgarian minority in the FRY: 
  [Begin Kontic recording] Turning attention away from the 
problem, that is, [words indistinct] both individual and 
collective rights of ethnic minorities in Bulgaria -- which is a 
well-known problem in Bulgaria -- and focusing it on the rights 
of the Bulgarian minority in neighboring countries. This is a 
well- known method of drawing the attention of one's public to 
some other issue. Secondly, we believe that this is actually 
part of a scenario drawn up by certain outside factors, and part 
of an additional and planned pressure on the FRY aimed at 
achieving the greatest possible destabilization before the 
decisive negotiations regarding the Srpska republic and the 
republic of Serbian Krajina, so that optimal results are 
achieved for the other side. [end recording]

  [Text] Goran Percevic, vice president of the Socialist 
Party of Serbia [SPS], in a statement for Belgrade Radio 
maintains that the sanctions against the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia [FRY] that were imposed two years ago had the goal of 
destroying Serbia economically and thwarting its policy of aid 
and solidarity with the struggle of the Serbian people in the 
republic of Srpska and the republic of Serbian Krajina. Two 
years later, we can say that Serbia and the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia have managed to withstand this terrible pressure -- 
that is, that the sanctions have not accomplished their goal -- 
said Percevic, and added that Serbia had had a dignified 
response to this attempt at economic destruction. I believe 
that this latest economic program that is being implemented in 
Serbia represents an economic response to the attempt at 
economic genocide over our country and people, said SPS Vice 
President Goran Percevic, in a statement for Radio Belgrade on 
the second anniversary of the sanctions.

<F P=106> [Article by Vesna Kostic and Aleksandra Bilanovic: "The </F>
Rigging of Life"] 
  [Excerpt] "We cannot be under blockade. Perhaps in 
a thousand years (the embargo could have some effect). But a 
few years? That is nothing." 
  -- Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia 
  "1.2 million children are starving in the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia." 
  -- Vlada Curguz, chairman of the Commission for Cooperation 
with UNICEF 
  The balance of the United Nations' two-year sanctions 
against 
Serbia and Montenegro is suspended between these two recent 
statements. The leadership and the policy has not changed, 
while the price was paid -- generally patiently and voluntarily 
-- by the population. 
  It is doubtful that the citizens are aware of this, because 
according to Dragan Popadic, professor of social psychology, 
"the sanctions affect the tissue of society in the same way 
radiation does: At first glance nothing seems to be changing 
and life goes on as usual. Like some irradiated organism, 
society becomes gravely ill without noticing it due to the still 
existing facade that things are functioning normally." 
  On the second anniversary of an unheard-of international 
isolation of a country, the Yugoslavs can conclude that, 
according to calculations of the Center for Development and 
Economic Policy of the Federal Ministry for Science and 
Development, they have lost some $45.117 billion. Zarko Katic, 
minister of transportation in Serbia, claims that this economic 
branch alone lost some $10 billion. The social product has been 
halved. This calculation does not include the other expenses 
caused by the blocked financial assets and property (20 sea and 
43 river vessels, and six aircraft, whose value exceeds $600 
million), and the loss of capital caused by the conversion of 
property into consumption. If the sanctions stay in place until 
2011 -- the Center assesses -- the cost of the blockade could 
mount to $147.334 billion. No one has yet calculated what will 
happen after a thousand years. 
  Infant mortality has climbed to 21.7 percent in 1992, while 
mortality among diabetics has doubled. Every other child in 
Belgrade is anemic; out of every 100 children hospitalized in 
1989, 1.45 died, while last year this number climbed to 2.07. 
In the first year of the embargo, mortality among old people 
increased from 501 percent in comparison to the distant 1986. 
The number of murders in the same period rose by 49 percent, 
and suicides by 22.8 percent. With an unemployment rate of 40 
percent among the able, working population, Yugoslavia tops the 
international charts. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Pristina, 28 May (TANJUG) -- The Serbian Internal 
Affairs Ministry has detained representatives of the "Kosovo 
Illegal Chamber of Commerce" who unlawfully tried to set up a 
"Kosovo Chamber of Commerce." 
  As a meeting of the "executive committee" of this illegal 
organization was due to start the police stormed the premises, 
prevented the meeting from taking place and arrested Ismailj 
Kastrati and Sulejman Ahmetaj, the "president" and "secretary" 
of this Albanian "chamber", together with 11 "committee" 
members. The first two were detained while the others were 
released after interrogation. 
  Reporting on this incident, the newspaper BUJKU said that 
the 
police acted correctly. The paper also recalls the statements 
by Serbian officials saying they will not tolerate any 
organization of parallel power in Kosmet. 
  BUJKU admits that the Serbian authorities granted licenses 
to 
14,000 private enterprises whose owners were mostly ethnic 
Albanians, but they cannot accept their being organized outside 
official institutions. 
  The Chamber of Commerce of Kosovo and Metohija does exist in 
Pristina. It represents the interests of all economic subjects 
regardless of their nationality. Ethnic Albanians are also 
members, and some of their private entrepreneurs are even using 
the premises that they leased from the Chamber. 
  However, the political group rallied round Ibrahim Rugova is 
trying to establish the parallel forms of power and thus prove 
that Kosovo is outside Serbia and that it is allegedly "a 
separate independent state."

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula </F>
Horn by Tibor J. Keri; place and date not given: "We Do Not 
Need Redeemers"] 
  [Text] [Keri] What do you expect from your party's 
extraordinary congress on 4 June? Apart from you, does anyone 
else have a chance to be nominated as candidate for the position 
of prime minister? 
  [Horn] The congress must decide about the possible coalition 
partners of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and also about 
the person who will be the party's candidate for the position of 
prime minister. Naturally, if the congress asks me to play this 
role, I will accept it. As for other possible candidates, I do 
not know of anyone, I do not have information about this; we 
will see how things develop. 
  [Keri] In your view, how long will the coalition talks last 
and when can a new government be formed? 
  [Horn] It is difficult to predict this, but I think that the 
coalition talks can end within one or a maximum of 
one-and-a-half months, and a new government can be formed by 
mid-July at the latest. 
  [Keri] Do you think it is wrong that the names of certain 
figures were made public prematurely as members of the new 
government? 
  [Horn] No. I think that we need a government of experts and 
I would welcome both Ferenc Glatz and Kalman Kulcsar in the next 
government. Of course, this does not yet mean any commitment 
but the aforementioned people are not MSZP members; on the other 
hand, they are experts of European reknown in their fields. I 
think that such viewpoints will also emerge at the coalition 
talks. 
  [Keri] Have you already asked the aforementioned persons 
whether they would accept a ministerial position? 
  [Horn] We have not held any committing talks but, naturally, 
I asked them whether they would accept such a role in the next 
government. After all, this still depends on many things.... 
  [Keri] What if the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] agrees 
after all to form a coalition with the MSZP but they do not 
accept you as prime minister? 
  [Horn] I do not think that the SZDSZ will come up with such 
a condition; the SZDSZ is much cleverer than that. Not to 
mention the fact that, today, most people in the SZDSZ 
leadership regard Balint Magyar's declarations as hasty. If 
they come up with any similar condition, this might hinder or 
even foil the formation of a coalition. I must add that the 
issue is not primarily about myself. It is rather about the fact 
that coalition talks that start with preconditions do not augur 
well. 
  [Keri] How much chance do you give to an MSZP-SZDSZ 
coalition? 
  [Horn] I see very big chances for this. Of course, there is 
no 100-percent guarantee for anything, but it seems that both 
parties have a strong willingness for coalition cooperation. 
  [Keri] Do you completely exclude the possibility of a 
coalition with the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP]? 
  [Horn] At the end of February, we said that we do not 
exclude the possiblity of a coalition with a KDNP free of 
extremism, because we judge quite a few things similarly. 
However, the campaign experience shows that the KDNP did not 
quite succeed in changing its style. They used a rather 
extremist tone, and this did not prove to be profitable for them. 
  [Keri] The new government is also facing tough and unpopular 
decisions. Do you think that you will lose the support of our 
society in a short time and the events of 1990 will repeat 
themselves, namely you will lose the local government elections? 
  [Horn] I do not fear that, because the new government will 
represent a totally different style than the current one. By 
this I mean that the new government will conduct an open policy 
and will not sign any secret agreement. We will sincerely 
present Hungary's real situation to the public, the "heritage" 
we received, and the very difficult tasks awaiting solution, 
tasks the new government will have to confront. On the other 
hand, the government will continue the social dialogue 
successfully used by the MSZP in the past four years. Contrary 
to the current government, we do not want to have confrontations 
with various strata of our society; instead, we will endeavor to 
come to an agreement with them. This could be one of the 
guarantees for a long-term activity of the new government. The 
other guarantee is that every government decision should be 
based on the view that the government is acting in the interest 
of a large majority of our society. Of course, all this cannot 
bring a spectacular improvement overnight. Most probably a 
considerable amount of time must pass for the people also to 
feel the changes in their everyday life. I can confidently say 
that, no matter how bad our situation is, it is not hopeless. 
We can stabilize the situation while definitely improving the 
situation of those mostly in need. However, we can only achieve 
considerable improvement in one or two years. 
  [Keri] According to [departing prime minister] Peter Boross, 
it is useless to prepare any inventory, because you are quite 
aware of Hungary's situation. 
  [Horn] I highly respect Mr. Boross for really doing 
everything in his power for the benefit of smooth elections, and 
I hope the same will apply to the second round. But Mr. Boross 
promised to present Hungary's real situation to the public. I 
do not see that the government did this. The government still 
has to prepare the bill and show the commitments it accepted and 
the commitments it will leave for its successor. Mr. Boross is 
giving evasive answers. I would really like him to think things 
over: He would also benefit from adequate relations between the 
government and the opposition in the next parliament. 
  [Keri] Mr. Boross also said that he would like to hold a 
detailed conversation with his successor on what mistakes the 
new government should avoid and what values it should preserve. 
If you become the prime minister, what will you expect from 
this conversation? 
  [Horn] I am open to any dialogue. Obviously, a departing 
prime minister can give very serious and wise advice to the new 
government. It is another matter to what extent the new prime 
minister can use this advice, because it is possible that things 
that Peter Boross finds very useful are regarded as nonessential 
things by us. Not accidentally, we would like to have a 
different policy and style from the one carried out by the 
current government. However, we would welcome a regular 
dialogue between Peter Boross and the other future opposition 
leaders and the future government parties. 
  [Keri] What attitude would you regard as desirable in the 
new parliament? 
  [Horn] I find it extremely important to ask the opinion of 
the opposition when preparing the laws, as well as the efforts 
for coming to an agreement. Even if the MSZP and the SZDSZ got 
a two-thirds majority in parliament, we would still endeavor to 
hold coordinating talks with the opposition by considering 
Hungary's interests. For example, clarifying the authority and 
jurisdiction of the president of the republic could be such an 
issue. I must point out that this would not mean any 
limitation. Something else: The opposition is also interested 
in legislating a good media law as soon as possible. I very 
much hope that, in line with their promises, they will play a 
really constructive opposition role. 
  [Keri] What is your opinion about the claim that an 
MSZP-SZDSZ two-thirds majority would carry the danger of a 
parliamentary dictatorship? 
  [Horn] A dictatorship would emerge if laws threatening 
democracy were legislated. I do not think, and I even find it 
an irresponsible and empty talk, that anyone presumes that the 
MSZP or the SZDSZ has such intentions. It is useless to 
threaten people with such things. 
  [Keri] In connection with this, what is your opinion about 
Matyas Szuros' recent declaration that Hungary would also 
benefit if the MSZP did not win too much? 
  [Horn] I find this ridiculous, because I cannot explain the 
meaning of "winning too much" [tulnyer]. What should one 
understand by this? If the MSZP achieved results close to an 
absolute majority, it could assert its views more successfully 
than with smaller results. Therefore, I would very much like 
Matyas Szuros to stop making such declarations. 
  [Keri] In connection with Miklos Nemeth, you said that 
people who struggled for the election results do not like it if 
someone joins the finished house.... 
  [Horn] I am glad you asked this question because the answer 
appears in print and this can be interpreted much more exactly 
than the spoken statement. By ready-made situation I meant that 
the MSZP achieved a considerable election result without Miklos 
Nemeth. The ready-made situation does not mean that Hungary is 
in some kind of a rosy state. Regarding Miklos Nemeth, in 
January we offered him the possibility to return to Hungarian 
political life. He was unable to accept this, but we did not 
rebuke him for this; we understood him. When it became clear 
that there is a debate regarding the person to be nominated as 
our candidate for the position of prime minister, one could hear 
voices saying that Miklos Nemeth will come and this will solve 
all the dilemmas. He will not be able to solve this because 
there are no redeemers. Hungary needs very tough and hard 
working people, rather than redeemers. One who has not lived 
through the struggles of past years is not really aware of 
Hungary's real situation, because this could not be sensed 
clearly either in London or Paris. I stress, however, that we 
would very much welcome Miklos Nemeth's future return to 
Hungarian political life because we are talking here about a 
valuable person. But this is not an issue for us today. 
  [Keri] Do you find it necessary to change the current 
government structure? 
  [Horn] By all means, but I would caution the new government 
not to start some kind of a radical reorganization. In my view, 
we definitely need an efficient economic cabinet and its head 
should have full authority. It was an impossible situation that 
four finance ministers replaced each other in the past four 
years and that economic ministers were constantly forced to 
confront each other and often forced to play against each other. 
Such a situation only harms the country. In addition, I am 
against any kind of amalgamation. I find it more important to 
eliminate quite a few offices. Compensations should end next 
year, and so should the Compensation Office. The National 
Information Office is absolutely useless and I do not know 
whether it is necessary to have an office for ethnic Hungarians 
living beyond our borders (although I can be convinced with 
proper arguments) because, in my opinion, the Foreign Ministry 
can carry out these tasks. In my view, managing the 
privatization affairs should be settled and the National 
Property Agency [AVU] and the State Trust Fund Ltd [AV Rt] 
should be amalgamated. In other words, we need a streamlined 
state administration by all means. 
  [Keri] Can you envisage the restoration of the position of 
deputy prime minister? 
  [Horn] I do not see much sense in this, although I am open 
to any argument. However, I do not find it a positive thing 
when a new government reorganizes everything. 
  [Keri] What is your opinion about Peter Boross' 
declaration that, according to Western European practice, the 
largest opposition party should fill the position of parliament 
chairman? An example of this was in 1990 when Arpad Goncz 
became chairman of the parliament and then president of the 
Republic. 
  [Horn] This is a very nice statement; interestingly enough, 
it is formulated when the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] is 
forced into the opposition. Arpad Goncz was chairman of the 
parliament for a very short time, until he was elected president 
of the Republic, and this was part of the MDF-SZDSZ pact. I do 
not find it necessary at all that the opposition should provide 
the chairman of the National Assembly. In my opinion, one of 
the parties that received the largest support should provide the 
chairman of the National Assembly. As for Peter Boross' 
statement, there are indeed countries where the representative 
of the opposition fills the position of parliament chairman. 
However, in neighboring Austria, for example, the deputy 
chairman of the ruling Social Democratic Party fills the 
position of parliament chairman. So, one does not have to go 
too far to refute this statement about the "Western European" 
practice.

<F P=106> [Interview with Imre Szekeres, executive deputy chairman of </F>
the Hungarian Socialist Party, by Henrik Hammang; place and date 
not given: "There Is No Overwinning Involved Here"] 
  [Text] The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] won the 1994 
elections with a landslide victory and obtained more than half 
of the parliamentary mandates. After the elections, MSZP Deputy 
Executive Chairman Imre Szekeres gave us an interview about the 
party's election successes and short-term concepts. 
  [Hammang] In view of the results, in your opinion, has the 
MSZP overwon itself or it has simply carried its best form? 
  [Szekeres] It is very difficult to answer this question. We 
repeatedly said that it is difficult to determine the concept of 
overwinning [tulgyozes]. If the voters thought to vote for the 
MSZP or its individual candidate, naturally this is a great 
pleasure for us and, in my opinion, the 270,000 extra votes 
compared to the first round of elections and the total of close 
to 2 million votes show a serious confidence in the MSZP. This 
support shows that everything that we thought about the country, 
the tasks, and the people's needs in the past four years was 
right. 
  [Hammang] After the first round, the public thought that 
only the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] was capable of 
forcing the MSZP back regarding the individual candidates and 
thus creating a proper balance in the next parliament. As shown 
by the results, the SZDSZ failed to achieve this. On the 
contrary: The well-known SZDSZ candidates failed to obtain a 
single mandate in Budapest, for example; only the MSZP and the 
Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] were able to do that. In your 
opinion, what is the reason behind this? 
  [Szekeres] I think that they put the question wrongly and 
also answered it wrongly. The MSZP behaved very politely 
between the two rounds and argued very calmly that the 
opposition should represent the balance against a government 
coalition, but this is not needed within a government. Given 
the results, the citizens also thought so. The results of the 
second round clearly proved that no negative campaign whatsoever 
leads to results in Hungary. If the SZDSZ had formulated its 
campaign differently -- saying that it knew the situation better 
or that its candidates were better than the candidates of other 
parties -- they would have achieved better results. 
  [Hammang] At its upcoming congress on 4 June, the MSZP will 
determine the party's candidate for the position of prime 
minister. Will the coalition talks start already this week, or 
will you only be preparing them until the upcoming MSZP congress? 
  [Szekeres] Our plan is unchanged: The congress will decide 
on the two major issues on 4 June. The two issues are: With 
which parties we should start coalition talks, and who should be 
the MSZP's candidate for the position of prime minister? This 
agenda will not change and I think every party needs to evaluate 
the election results and to consider the situation. 
  [Hammang] It has been said that, regarding the coalition 
possibilities, you are open to every democratic party. However, 
it has also been said that, along with the most probable 
partner, the SZDSZ, the MSZP only considers parties that did not 
compromise themselves with their participation in the losing 
coalition. In addition, in view of the considerable differences 
between the ideas of the MSZP and the Independent Smallholders 
Party [FKGP], only the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] 
remains as a possible coalition party among the six parties. 
  [Szekeres] We must consider several things in this respect. 
One of them is the need to find out which party program can be 
adjusted to the MSZP concepts. It is also an important factor 
to find out who thought in terms of different government policy 
than the one prevailing so far. In this respect, we can 
consider the SZDSZ and the Fidesz. I would regard this as a 
starting point. Theoretically, we cannot exclude the cooperation 
of all the three political poles in a government either. 
Cooperation with the Christian Democratic People's Party 
[KDNP], the only force to be considered in this respect, is only 
possible after the necessary political changes. Naturally, all 
these are only theoretical possibilities. 
  In the course of coalition talks, it is essential that the 
composition of Hungary's next government should not be 
determined by party or individual interests. The people have 
lost their patience and the current situation is quite 
difficult, so it is very important to create a stable government 
that is able to function. 
  [Hammang] We learned that several SZDSZ leaders think that, 
given the 54-percent parliamentary majority of the MSZP, there 
is no longer need for a coalition. 
  [Szekeres] The best thing for the SZDSZ is also to wait for 
the coalition talks and then decide on possible cooperation. 
All the more so because the SZDSZ is also obliged by the 
elections in a certain respect, at least in the sense that the 
SZDSZ was speaking about a different government in the past 
years and, in their view, they have an adequate program for 
this. All this could be implemented in a coalition government. 
This 54-percent magic totally contradicts the elementary logic 
of an attitude toward a consensus. I say that we should sit 
down and talk, and then think about each other's percentage. 
  [Hammang] At his late-night news conference, MSZP Chairman 
Gyula Horn said that the MSZP will be able to solve the problems 
and will take short-term measures that will lead to improvement. 
Are there really possibilities for this? 
  [Szekeres] It is very important that Gyula Horn made these 
promises after the elections, rather than before the elections; 
in other words, the citizens did not vote for the MSZP because 
of these promises. Gyula Horn and those who are engaged in 
politics in a responsible way in Hungary think that changes must 
be made in the people's situation. There are things that do not 
cost money and nevertheless can lead to considerable changes, 
like the style or the government's attitude toward the people. 
In addition, some ideas can also be implemented under the 
current financial conditions. Naturally, issues that imply 
considerable expenses can only be solved in the long term.

<F P=106> [Interview with Michael Zantovsky, Czech ambassador to the </F>
United States, by Kveta Subrtova; place and date not given: "The 
Czech Republic's Presence in the American Market Should Be 
Stronger"] 
  [Text] [Subrtova] The post-November Czechoslovakia, and 
then also the Czech Republic, enjoyed relatively high political 
and economic respect in the United States. How successful has 
the Czech Republic been in preserving its good reputation now, 
when the attention of the United States in Europe is focused 
more on the southeast and east? 
  [Zantovsky] Political and economic respect cannot be 
measured by the number of newspaper headlines or public 
statements. Serious international problems and crises attract 
most of the attention, but our country has been spared them, 
fortunately. The continuing political respect -- which was best 
expressed by President Clinton's visit to Prague in January this 
year -- as well as the continuing economic interest -- 
documented by that fact that more than half of all foreign 
investments in the Czech economy in 1993 came precisely from the 
United States -- show that our mutual relations have maintained 
a constantly high level, which is without precedent in our 
modern history. The Czech Republic has the reputation of being 
a stable, reliable, and economically very promising partner. 
  The United States is still interested in our market, access 
to our market, and investments. A mission from the government 
agency for foreign private investments, OPIC, will arrive in 
Prague in June, bringing with it several dozen interested 
American entrepreneurs. We only have to look at the activity of 
the U.S. Embassy commercial section, foreign services of the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture, or the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 
in the Czech Republic, to see that the United States does not 
underestimate its access to our market. 
  [Subrtova] There is no doubt about the fact that President 
Bill Clinton's visit to Prague in January was important for 
American-Czech relations. Is there any specific evidence yet 
that the impetus that this visit could, and should have brought 
for the development of relations between our two countries in 
the political, cultural, and, particularly, the economic sphere 
is being implemented? 
  [Zantovsky] The start of the Partnership For Peace project 
-- which all the participating countries in the Prague summit 
and a number of other countries have joined -- was the main 
result of President Clinton's visit to Prague. Now, the program 
is in the stage of preparation, while presentation documents are 
being handed over. These documents will determine the specific 
modalities of the participation of individual countries. It is 
important that we have succeeded, for the time being, in 
preserving the principle of the equality of all countries 
participating in the program. By granting special status to any 
country, the program would be downgraded. 
  The conference in the fall on free trade between the United 
States and the countries of central and Eastern Europe will be 
the result of the impetus in the economic sphere. In this 
connection, we can observe a revival of American interest in the 
idea of a free trade zone between the United States and the 
CEFTA [Central European Free Trade Association] countries. I 
believe our American partners will be able to prepare a program 
for the conference that could result in a larger opening of the 
market to our products and build on the steps that the U.S. 
Government took at the beginning of the nineties. The Czech 
Republic may have acquired a permanent most-favored-nation 
clause, but there are still quantity restrictions on some of our 
commodities, for instance, in the form of quotas on the import 
of our cheese or textiles. One of the positive steps could be 
the preservation, or even a further extension of the system of 
customs preferences for our products. 
  [Subrtova] Today, Czech diplomatic missions in the world 
largely supplant the role of commercial and economic 
"reconnaissance" [vysadek]. What is the activity of the embassy 
whose head you are? 
  [Zantovsky] Along with the center of the Czech Republic's 
economic activity being transferred to the sphere of private 
enterprise, the role of embassies in this sphere is also being 
changed. We see our role particularly in transmitting high 
quality economic and commercial information in both directions, 
and in promoting the potential of our economy and our economic 
results, not only in Washington, but all over the United States' 
territory. 
  [Subrtova] What problems are you encountering in this 
activity, and what success, if any, have you achieved? How 
could our domestic (Czech) economic sphere help you in this 
respect? Moreover, what can you offer, or what advice can you 
give to our businessmen, bankers, and entrepreneurs? 
  [Zantovsky] I dare hope that we, too, deserve some credit 
for the continuing interest of American businesses in investing 
in the Czech Republic, and for the successful course of 
negotiations on certain larger-scale economic projects. We are 
paying primary attention to the economic sphere. Our monthly 
bulletin, CZECH THE NEWS, which is now in the second year of 
publication, also plays a positive role in that respect. Since 
January 1994, our bulletin has been available also in electronic 
form on the Internet network. We organize a number of events, 
lectures, and seminars regarding these problems. At present, we 
are preparing a lecture on privatization to be delivered by R. 
Sabela, deputy minister of industry and trade, a seminar with 
our representatives in the International Monetary Fund and the 
World Bank, and we are cooperating in the preparation of a 
seminar on the development of tourism in the Czech Republic, in 
which Economy Minister K. Dyba should participate. 
  We would also welcome it if we managed to organize this 
year a publicity trip for Minister of Industry and Trade Dlouhy 
to several places in the United States, a trip that would focus 
on business and investments, like the one to Canada recently. 
America is not just Washington and New York; it is also the 
midwest, Texas, California, and other states. In all those 
places there are potential opportunities for expanding our 
economic relations. Whenever possible, I try to help develop 
these relations when personally visiting various regions in the 
United States. 
  In comparison with some comparable European countries, we 
feel that the presence of the Czech Republic should be stronger 
on such a large market as the American one. It would help us 
very much if the concept for the pro-export policy were 
completed and included provisions for providing company service, 
searching for partners, and furnishing information on their 
credibility, etc. Our representative office should not engage 
in this activity, but other entities should, such as the 
Economic Chamber or the Association of Industry. The 
Association of Industry should set up UNIDO offices, where Czech 
investment specialists are active, also in Washington, apart 
from Europe and Tokyo. A possibility has arisen to open a 
CZECHINVEST branch in California. It would be very beneficial 
if a Czech tourist center could be independently active here. I 
believe it is important for the further development of economic 
activity also to expand -- following the example of other 
countries -- our diplomatic presence on the territory of such a 
vast country as the United States. The opening of the Consulate 
General in Los Angeles, which is being prepared, and our efforts 
to establish honorary consulates in a number of the states are 
related to this. The forthcoming opening of the Czech Center in 
New York plays an important role here. 
  Our national agencies and businesses help us most by 
providing us with high quality information on the macroeconomic 
situation, and also on entrepreneurial and business 
opportunities on the microeconomic level. We would like to 
receive more information and more often. 
  Regarding providing advice, I will be more cautious. It is 
easy to give advice where other peoples' money is involved. If 
I may give advice, then I would say that it is very important to 
adopt in business and other negotiations something that they 
call here "follow through" [previous two words published in 
English], which means, approximately, "carry matters to 
completion." This is commonplace here. Any letter or fax, or 
telephone call that is not answered for a long time, reduces the 
probability of a successful result. It is equally important to 
remember that in American business ethics an oral agreement has 
practically the same weight as a written one, and is considered 
binding by both parties. I dare say that, if local demands on 
speed, promptness, and meeting obligations are met, Americans 
are the most reliable partners in the world. 
  Independence and initiative are additional prerequisites for 
a business success in the United States. Sometimes, I have the 
feeling that it is the absence of these qualities that prevents 
us from making better use of the great prospects in the sphere 
of small and medium-size enterprises. A number of U.S. 
manufacturers would be interested in manufacturing their 
products, or parts of them, with incomparably lower costs in our 
country and would welcome offers from our side. Within our 
possibilities, we try to transmit even this information. 
However, this is a task, above all, for non- government 
economic and commercial representative offices. 
  [Subrtova] What is your personal experience regarding the 
possibility of equitable cooperation between a small Central 
European country and the only world superpower today? 
  [Zantovsky] I, myself, am of small stature, but I have never 
had difficulty in cooperating with people who are 15 inches 
taller. In cooperation between two countries, size is not of 
primary importance, either. The important thing is whether one 
country has something to offer the other. We have so much to 
offer that, despite all the work I have to do, I can still find 
moments in which I can be proud of being a Czech.

  [Text] Moscow, May 30 (TANJUG) -- Russia's special envoy 
and Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin is in Zagreb at the 
start of a new mission aimed at settling the conflict in former 
Yugoslavia. As announced in Moscow, Churkin is to meet with 
members of the Croatian leadership in Zagreb on Monday to 
discuss the implementation of a Russia-brokered agreement on a 
cessation of hostilities between Croatia and the Republic of 
Serb Krajina. They are also expected to discuss the situation 
in war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina and other issues regarding the 
settling of the conflict in former Yugoslavia. 
  On Tuesday, Churkin is expected to leave for Belgrade, where 
he will meet with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to 
discuss the finding of a settlement for the Bosnian conflict. 
  Churkin is in Zagreb and Belgrade on the eve of a meeting 
scheduled for June 2-3 by U.N. special envoy for former 
Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi. The Russian envoy wants to check 
once again Belgrade's and Zagreb's stands on the Bosnian crisis. 
Over the past few days Churkin has on several occasions 
criticized the Bosnian Moslems for their attacks on Serb 
positions in Bosnia. 
  A ranking official at the Russian Foreign Ministry told the 
Russian Interfax agency on Monday that special importance was 
being attached to Churkin's current mission because it comes 
after the failure of the meeting between the international 
"contact group" for Bosnia-Herzegovina and the representatives 
of Bosnia's three warring sides. 
  The official said the declaration released at the Geneva 
meeting of the foreign ministers of the European Union, the 
United States and Russia on the territorial division of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina according to which the Bosnian Serbs should 
get 49 per cent and the Croat-Moslem federation 51 per cent of 
the territory of that former Yugoslav republic -- was still 
effective. 
  Russian sources claim that such a proportion will most 
probably be accepted both by the Croat and the Moslem side, but 
the main problem will be the "quality" of the territories. 
  The Serbs, who are now holding 70 per cent of the territory 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, are willing to give up a certain 
percentage provided that they do not lose anything of "quality".

  [Text] The political movements of the Hungarian community 
in Slovakia, after many earlier conflicts and disputes, are, 
according to the signs, striving for more intensive cooperation. 
Ildiko Nagy reports from Bratislava. 
  [Nagy] At its session yesterday, the National Council of 
Coexistence authorized the movement's executive body to begin 
discussions, with the involvement of the Hungarian Christian 
Democratic Movement [MKDH] and the Hungarian Civic Party [MOS], 
about setting up a close triple coalition. 
  Although the delegates took tacit cognizance of the fact 
that 
discussions are to be pursued with the MKDH, the current 
coalition partner, they are of the view that the close unity of 
Slovakia's Hungarian community will in future be rendered 
possible by their union. However, on account of the criticisms 
connected with it, they are presuming that it cannot be 
developed at the moment, and that is why discussions have to be 
started about the establishment of a triple coalition. 
  According to Coexistence, the two partners -- that is the 
MKDH and the MOS -- must undertake a commitment to form a joint 
deputies' group in parliament, to put forward a joint candidate 
for the local government elections in October, to create a joint 
local-government and foreign affairs council, and in the future 
to take a united stand on forums abroad.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Lyuben Berov by Irena </F>
Marinova at the Bulgarian National Assembly on 26 May: "No One 
Envies Me for the Role I Perform"] 
  [Text] On 26 May Prime Minister Berov was constantly 
besieged by TRUD reporters. The interview with him began in the 
parliament at noon, when the prime minister arrived for his 
meetings with the parliamentary factions, and continued, rather 
indelicately, when Professor Berov was on his way to or from the 
lavatory. When the prime minister heard the results of the 
vote, he answered the questions of our reporter first. 
<H5>  Before the Vote </H5>
  [Marinova] Mr. Prime Minister, why did you decide to ask for 
a vote of confidence on the basis of the government's program 
until September 1994, and not on a specific matter or on the 
cabinet's comprehensive policy? 
  [Berov] Why? The vote is on the cabinet's comprehensive 
policy. 
  [Marinova] What do you mean? The request for a confidence 
vote that was submitted today by Veselin Blagoev, chief 
secretary of the Council of Ministers, stresses that it is 
related to the program. 
  [Berov] Well, yes. This is our present comprehensive 
policy. What is so strange about it? 
  [Marinova] It is strange because you selected precisely this 
alternative, while the Constitution offers two additional 
alternatives. 
  [Berov] I think that this is the most prudent one. 
  [Marinova] What are your arguments? 
  [Berov] Oh, come on. What arguments do you want. (laughs) 
The argument is that we want to form an efficient government 
that will be limited in its term of office and tasks. The 
program we submitted represents the limited character of our 
tasks. 
  [Marinova] Would you like to head a caretaker cabinet? 
  [Berov] Ah, this does not depend on me only. It is not the 
executive power that forms a caretaker cabinet. 
  [Marinova] How long do you give the cabinet you head? 
  [Berov] You must ask the parliament. 
  [Marinova] Well, I am asking you, and I am interested in 
your forecast. 
  [Berov] For the time being, we are talking about the period 
until September. 
  [Marinova] Am I to understand that you are sure of the 
confidence vote? 
  [Berov] I think so, although we could also not receive it. 
It is up to parliament. 
  [Marinova] Do you refuse to resign because of an inner 
conviction or because of someone's pressure, and if so, who is 
this someone? 
  [Berov] No, this depends on me. I have said this 100 times, 
and I have said it to you too. I hope you understand. 
  [Marinova] Nevertheless, would you resign? 
  [Berov] No, there is no reason for that. 
  [Marinova] The impression emerges that deputies and 
parliamentary factions advise you to not resign. 
  [Berov] No, no. I say that if someone wants to foil this 
government, he must admit this. I stressed "if," and I was very 
clear and brief. 
  [Marinova] How could you explain a failure to sign the 
framework agreement? 
  [Berov] I would explain it by the unwillingness of the 
people to sign. 
  [Marinova] Whom do you see as the future prime minister? 
  [Berov] I do not determine this. If I was a king, I would 
have appointed prime ministers, but I am not one. 
  [Marinova] What did you discuss with the Bulgarian Socialist 
Party [BSP]? 
  [Berov] We discussed the program we submitted. 
  [Marinova] Did the Socialists say that they will support the 
government program until September? 
  [Berov] No, we did not talk about this. Their parliamentary 
faction must decide this. 
  [Marinova] But you said that you talked about the program? 
  [Berov] Discussing the merits of the program's elements is 
one thing and the support of the parliamentary faction is 
another. 
  [Marinova] Did you discuss structural and personnel changes 
in the cabinet with the BSP? 
  [Berov] No, their parliamentary faction will convene in two 
to three hours. 
  [Marinova] How could you explain the fact that a 
substantial part of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] will 
support you? 
  [Berov] Why do you ask me and not them? Let us see first if 
this happens. 
  [Marinova] I am sure that you will get your vote of 
confidence. 
  [Berov] I understand this, but I can answer your question 
only after the vote. 
  [Marinova] Have you been disappointed only by Ivan Pushkarov 
because of the double standards he demonstrated? 
  [Berov] Yes, deeply. 
  [Marinova] Who else? 
  [Berov] No one. Simply, this is the man with whom I talked 
at the Boyana residence, and who then said "I never saw him." 
(crosses himself) 
  [Marinova] Are you disappointed by the BSP? They also 
changed their position. 
  [Berov] No one else said "I never saw him." 
<H5>  After the Vote </H5>
  [Marinova] Prof. Berov, how do you explain the support of 
those 125 deputies? Did they do it because of you and your 
cabinet, or because they do not want to part with their 
parliamentary seats, since they know that they have no chance in 
the next parliament? 
  [Berov] I do not know. You must ask them. 
  [Marinova] (The time is 2010, and the first to greet the 
prime minister is Ahmed Dogan, leader of the Movement for Rights 
and Freedoms -- DPS). Are you sure that Mr. Ahmed Dogan was 
sincere in his greetings? 
  [Berov] I do not know. You must ask him. 
  [Marinova] Which politician do you think will be sincere in 
his greetings? 
  [Berov] I do not know. So far he was the only one to greet 
me. If you were the second I could say eventually that you were 
more sincere. 
  [Marinova] Could you repeat today the words of the ancient 
military leader "veni, vidi, vici" [I came, I saw, I conquered]? 
  [Berov] No. First of all I am not an ancient military 
leader. I even think that no one envies me for this role that I 
was entrusted with. 
  [Marinova] Do you not feel yourself to be a winner? 
  [Berov] No. It is not important how a man feels who has 
been entrusted with the task to steer the vessel out of the 
waves. 
  [Marinova] On whom do you rely? 
  [Berov] I do not rely on anything. 
  [Marinova] Were you ready to resign? 
  [Berov] Of course. If parliament would have voted 
negatively. 
  [Marinova] Will you make personnel changes in the cabinet? 
Should we expect structural changes? 
  [Berov] There are at least certain minimal changes that must 
be effected. Then there is a person who resigned. 
  [Marinova] Will the resignation of [Deputy Prime Minister] 
Karabashev be the only change? 
  [Berov] No. [Justice Minister] Kornazhev must also go. 
Actually, he has already been replaced. Thus, at least two 
people must go, and perhaps even more. 
  [Marinova] Will the agreement on the foreign debt save the 
cabinet? 
  [Berov] No. I even think that this is not the most crucial 
factor. (Turns to the journalists around him) Do not push! 
  [Marinova] If not the agreement on the foreign debt, then 
what saved you this time? 
  [Berov] I cannot tell you, because I do not know who voted 
for me. 
  [Marinova] I am asking you about the reasons, not about the 
personalities. 
  [Berov] I cannot answer this. 
  [Marinova] Thank you, Prof. Berov.

<F P=106> [Fa.Bax. report: "`Omonia Activists Involved in Espionage'"] </F>
  [Text] Tirana -- Six local leaders of Omonia, recently 
arrested in a lightning strike of the Albanian police, have now 
been accused of espionage. Theodori Bezhani, Irakli Sirma, and 
Kosta Qirja from Gjirokaster; Vangjel Paparisto from Sarande; 
and Panajot Marto and Kosta Cavo, resident in Delvine, are now 
being held in prison on the serious charge of "maintaining links 
with the Greek secret services." Some time ago, they had all 
faced the preliminary charges of illegally carrying weapons and 
of anticonstitutional activities. Following further 
investigations, the Tirana Procurator's Office has now declared 
its opinion on the six arrested members of the Greek minority. 
Those arrested are almost all leaders of local organizations of 
Omonia, or people well-known for their activities in the Greek 
minority areas. 
  The news, since confirmed by the Tirana Procurator's Office, 
came only one day after the news conference of the leadership of 
the Greek minority organization, at which Omonia Chairman Sotir 
Qirjazati had one again asked for the highest Albanian state 
authorities to intervene to free the six persons under arrest, 
and had reemphasized their innocence. The Omonia leadership 
also repeated the demands they submitted about one year ago, 
including for "an increase in local self-government." Among the 
most important demands put forward by Omonia are the right to 
Greek-language broadcasting and the right to use two official 
languages and two national symbols. 
  All these developments take place at a time when there is an 
evident increase in diplomatic efforts to improve relations 
between the two states, which have passed through a chilly 
period following last month's serious terrorist incident near 
the village of Peshkepi. Meanwhile, following their first 
meeting in Zurich, the two foreign ministers, Serreqi and 
Papulias, have agreed to meet in Tirana in order to discuss the 
problems still existing between the two countries. Albanian 
President Sali Berisha himself reemphasized his readiness to 
assist the good progress of these relations. Replying to a Greek 
journalist's question on 19 May, Berisha said, "I agree to visit 
Athens, of course, if they invite me."

  [Text] Zagreb, May 28 (AFP) -- UN envoy Yasushi Akashi has 
invited the warring parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina to negotiate a 
comprehensive cessation of hostilities at a meeting in Geneva 
next week, the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] announced Saturday 
[28 May]. The co-chairmen of the peace conference on the former 
Yugoslavia, Lord Owen of the European Union and Thorvald 
Stoltenberg of the United Nations, as well as U.S. special envoy 
Charles Redman and his Russian counterpart Vitaliy Churkin, were 
also invited, an UNPROFOR statement said. Akashi will be 
accompanied at the Geneva meeting, to be held Thursday and 
Friday [2-3 June], by UNPROFOR commander for ex-Yugoslavia 
Lieutenant-General Bertrand de Lapresle, and the UNPROFOR 
commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Lieutenant-General Sir Michael 
Rose, the statement added. 
  Akashi, in letters sent to Bosnian President Alija 
Izetbegovic and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic on Friday, 
"drew attention to the presidential statement adopted by the UN 
Security Council on 25 May 1994 in which the Council reaffirmed 
the urgent need for a comprehensive cessation of hostilities 
throughout the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina." 
  Next week's meeting aims to build on Akashi's May 21 
initiative "putting forward a framework for an immediate 
cessation of hostilities between the parties, including 
provision for the disengagement of forces and the 
interpositioning of UNPROFOR troops between the forces." 
  The announcement comes after France hosted two-day talks 
between the so-called contact group on Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the 
European Union, Russia and the United States -- and Bosnian 
Croats, Moslems and Serbs Wednesday and Thursday in the Alpine 
hideaway of Talloires, not far from Geneva. The session reached 
no apparent agreement, but another round was scheduled in the 
French resort town on June 6 and 7. The contact group 
negotiators tried in vain to get the factions to agree to a 
four-month ceasefire and to accept a European plan for partition 
that would give 51 percent of territory to a Croat-Moslem 
federation and 49 percent to the Serbs.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item; by Borislav Lalic] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, May 27 (TANJUG) -- The United States for 
the first time on Thursday forced itself to admit that all 
Bosnian warring sides were responsible for the war in the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  U.S. State Department spokesman Mike McCurry on Thursday 
said 
that the U.S. Government did not single out anyone as 
responsible for the setback in the Bosnian peace talks. 
Washington has, on all earlier occasions, laid the blame for the 
Bosnian civil war on the Serbs, increasingly often referring to 
them as the aggressors. It is probably premature to interpret 
McCurry's statement as an about-face in Washington's policy 
towards the Bosnian conflict and it the way it can be resolved. 
However, Washington has come up with new signals and a change 
of tone. 
  This can also be concluded from Wednesday's statement by 
U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, who said that the United States would 
not unilaterally exempt the Bosnian Moslems from the U.N. arms 
sales embargo, imposed in 1991 on all of the former Yugoslavia. 
  This came as a cold shower for Bosnian Moslem leader Alija 
Izetbegovic, who, in an interview to the WASHINGTON POST, has 
said that the Moslems would beat the Serbs, if not by knocking 
them out, then by scoring points. This the more so since 
Izetbegovic made the statement on the eve of the opening of the 
Talloires peace talks on Bosnia. 
  McCurry's statement also implied the State Department's turn 
about, as he resolutely dismissed speculations that the U.S. 
would support the Moslem-Croat federation's demand to be given 
58 per cent of Bosnian territory. 
  McCurry argued that Izetbegovic was familiar with the U.S. 
position on the territorial division of Bosnia-Herzegovina based 
on the European Union [EU] plan, which envisages 49 per cent of 
the territory for the Bosnian Serbs and 51 for the Moslem-Croat 
federation. 
  Washington has thus stressed its commitment to the E.U. 
peace 
plan in seeking a political solution to the Bosnian crisis. 
  What is the most important is that the U.S. has turned 
towards Europe's realistic orientation, which should imply that 
a peaceful settlement will be sought in negotiations rather in 
NATO military actions. 
  Washington's volte face could also imply that the 
belligerence of the Bosnian Moslems might subside. 
  However, it is a different matter altogether if Washington's 
new frame of mind would be enough for peace to prevail.

  [Text] After the talks with President Tudjman in Zagreb 
this afternoon, Russian special envoy Vitaliy Churkin looked 
more than satisfied when he met reporters. According to him, 
important agreements have been reached. 
  [Churkin, in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian 
translation] "I had two main tasks today. First, to make sure 
that all sides are ready for the very important meeting in 
Geneva on Thursday. Second, I was trying to find a way out of 
the deadlock in the talks on economic cooperation between Zagreb 
and Knin." 
  [Announcer] Churkin expects that all negotiating parties 
will 
turn up in Geneva, for -- as he puts it -- the negotiators have 
an obligation to the world community. 
  [Churkin] "On the second subject, I have an impression that 
the deadlock in the economic talks has been resolved. I am 
encouraged that we will soon see the beginning of the talks on 
economic cooperation, which will immediately come up with 
concrete economic measures, which will in turn enable further 
important steps to normalize relations between Zagreb and Knin." 
  [Announcer] Although Churkin announced further talks, the 
question of the venue and the date for the talks still remains 
open. 
  [Churkin] "I am not in a position at this point to make an 
announcement, but I believe that a venue will be found to their 
mutual satisfaction. As I said, the most important thing is 
that the deadlock has been resolved." 
  [Announcer] Churkin expects a great deal from the Geneva 
talks. He believes that the world community is at this point 
offering the greatest chances for peace, and it is up to the 
negotiators to accept it. To use his full influence on all 
parties in the Geneva negotiations, he is to travel to Sarajevo 
tomorrow for talks with Alija Izetbegovic and Kresimir Zubak.

  [Text] Zagreb, May 31 (AFP) -- Serbs from the 
self-proclaimed republic of Krajina in Croatia Tuesday [31 May] 
blocked UN aid convoys destined for the north-west Bosnian 
pocket of Bihac, the spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees, Peter Kessler, said. The Krajina Serbs have for the 
past two weeks held up convoys destined for the south of the 
Bihac pocket, which is controlled by the mainly-Moslem Bosnian 
government army. On Tuesday they extended the ban to convoys 
going to Velika Kladusa, headquarters of the maverick Moslem 
leader Fikret Abdic whose forces are fighting the Bosnian army. 
  Until the latest move, convoys for Velika Kladusa could 
leave 
Krajina without authorisation. "The Serbs now want us to provide 
authorisation for every convoy, one week in advance, from Knin," 
the headquarters of the Krajina Serbs, Kessler said. An 
estimated 230,000 people living in Bihac, surrounded by Krajina 
and Bosnian Serbs, depend on the UN delivering around 2,900 
tonnes of food per month.

  [Text] The Croatian delegation was one of the most active 
at the nonaligned conference. This is demonstrated by the 
numerous bilateral talks -- with Cyprus, Malta, China, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Italy, Greece, Angola, Tunisia, Kenya, Costa 
Rica, Venezuela, and Morocco. 
  [Begin Foreign Minister Granic recording -- not introduced 
by 
announcer nor identified by screen caption] I have used my time 
in Cairo to hold a number of bilateral talks with countries from 
Europe, Africa, and Latin America primarily about the peaceful 
reintegration of UN Protected Areas [UNPA's] into Croatia's 
legal system. 
  As has been announced, Croatia will demand that the UN 
General Assembly discuss an additional item at its session in 
September -- the UNPA's and the problems of their reintegration. 
We received firm support on this from many countries and a high 
degree of understanding from all countries for Croatia's just 
demands. 
  I also discussed the establishment of diplomatic relations 
with Angola and Kenya. I had very important talks with the 
heads of the Greek and Italian delegations, where we discussed 
problems between Italy and Croatia which must be resolved in a 
good-neighborly manner, without any tension. Italy reiterated 
its position on the inviolability of borders. I believe that 
the prime ministers and foreign ministers will meet during the 
conference of the Central European Initiative in Trieste in 
mid-July. 
  As regards Greece, we expect that as the country currently 
chairing the European Union [EU], in the next few days it will 
reply to Croatia's demand to have talks with the EU on economic 
cooperation and on joining the PHARE program. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman by Mirko </F>
Galic, newly appointed director of Croatian television, at the 
Presidential palace in Zagreb on 28 May; prerecorded questions 
posed by various political personalities -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Galic] The topic of our conversation with 
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman is what is happening in 
Croatia and what will happen in the future. Good afternoon, Mr. 
President. 
  [Tudjman] Good afternoon, Mr. Galic. Let me first 
congratulate you on the appointment to the very responsible 
position of director of Croatian TV. 
  [Galic] Thank you and welcome to the Croatian TV program, in 
which our viewers and political party representatives will ask 
you questions. The first question is prompted by the events 
themselves. This year, Statehood Day coincided with a crisis in 
the Croatian parliament, which has not been solved and which 
will, in a way, be dormant during the celebrations. Could you 
tell us -- so far you have not voiced your opinion either as the 
party leader or the head of state -- whether the assembly will 
start a session with all deputies, and whether the crisis and 
the blocking of the parliament will be overcome immediately 
after the Statehood Day holiday? 
  [Tudjman] You see, I think that the crisis has already been 
overcome because those who wanted to cause a parliamentary and 
constitutional crisis did not succeed. They did not manage to 
cause a rift in the majority party. Seeing that this failed, 
there was no crisis on the scale the scenario-makers wanted. 
  You said that I had not voiced my opinion. That is not 
entirely true because before the sessions of both chambers of 
the assembly I invited party leaders -- both of the HDZ 
[Croatian Independent Democrats] and the opposition parties -- 
and asked them -- in state interests -- to solve the crisis 
created by the defection of the presidents of the two chambers 
and the creation of the new party. I pointed out to them that 
the stability of the democratic system was in the interest of 
the Croatian state. It was precisely with the stability of its 
democratic system that Croatia has gained confidence of the 
important international players, but the world also needs a 
stable Croatia. [sentence as heard] Considering the 
circumstances in which we live and the tasks that the Croatian 
state is facing, in dealing with all issues we should bare in 
mind this demand by both the Croatian people and the world. 
  I told our most influential politicians that it would be in 
the interest that the crisis which arose -- not the one they 
wanted to create -- be overcome. I think that a positive 
solution has been reached. Not only because the majority party 
has retained its majority in both chambers, so the parliamentary 
system can continue to function, but also because the division 
inside the opposition party failed. There are rifts in all 
parties, but the opposition parties have now adopted a more 
reasonable approach, not only to the problems of solving the 
parliamentary crisis, but also to the whole of the state policy. 
Consequently, I believe that after Statehood Day that crisis 
will be solved formally as well. 
  [Galic] You tried -- this is why you summoned all party 
leaders -- to reach a certain accord on some important issues of 
Croatia's political system and political activities. Is that 
one of the guidelines of your political activity, especially now 
when Croatia must have, one the one hand, stability, and on the 
other social and political unity in the country? 
  [Tudjman] These have been my commitments and my policy, not 
only now but since we started creating democratic Croatia. We 
need the highest possible accord, since we are still facing the 
occupation of certain areas of Croatia. But we also need a 
stable government and stability in the parliament. 
  We should not forget that the fact that we have had a 
majority government and an accord on all important issues was a 
precondition for our victories. We should therefore not give up 
on that and not forget that it was precisely due to our firm and 
stable democratic system that we could have achieved all the 
successes in relation to the aggression, the economy and the 
international acceptance of Croatia as an important factor not 
only in solving the crisis on the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia, but also as one of the most important factors in 
creating a new international order in this part of southeastern 
Europe. 
  [Galic] There have been a lot of suggestions about what 
could 
happen if the parliamentary crisis is not solved, if the ruling 
party becomes a minority -- which has not happened -- if the 
opposition continues with its demands -- which also seems not to 
have happened. Still, generally speaking, theoretically, as the 
party leader and head of state you have two ways of exerting 
influence on the crisis. One, you can influence your party. 
Two, you have the constitutional power to suspend the 
parliament and call elections in the event of a huge crisis. 
Have you ever considered doing that because that has been 
speculated on in the public? Under what conditions would you 
possibly agree to that or do it yourself? 
  [Tudjman] You see, there is an old saying in Zagreb: What 
would be if it would be. I would not like to speculate on this. 
  In any event, I would make a decision in the interest of 
Croatian democracy, the free democratic Croatia, the Croatian 
state. If the rift had succeeded, naturally, we would have 
tried to solve the stability of the future government within the 
parliament. Failing that, it is certain that I would use my 
constitutional power and address the nation to explain to them 
the problems and causes of the parliamentary crisis, what tasks 
Croatia faces and what we must do. 
  I had faith in the Croatian people since the first 
parliamentary elections in 1990. We held elections in 1992 and 
in 1993 when we did not have to, but we wanted to strengthen the 
democratic system and prove to the world that we are a country 
that wants to get out of the old socialist, communist system as 
soon as possible. I had faith in our people then, and I would 
have it now. I also believe that if that situation had arisen 
-- if we had to go, if I had had to take other steps -- we would 
have come out of it democratically strengthened, not weakened. 
  Let us have a look at the world. In parliaments where there 
is not one majority party, but different parties and different 
ideological approaches, where there are coalition governments -- 
in many countries, from the Baltics to the Black Sea and the 
Adriatic the communists are coming back to power or there are 
coalition governments -- they are helpless in solving not only 
political, but also economic problems. Precisely because we 
have had a stable government and a majority in the parliament, 
we have managed to achieve all the successes we have achieved. 
  I have said this once before. For me as the president of the 
republic, it would be simpler if I did not interfere in 
inter-party relations. However, I state with all responsibility 
that if we did not have the majority party, we would not have 
been able to pursue this policy and achieve political and 
economic successes, both internally and on the international 
scene. This is why I invited the party leaders and asked them 
to solve this crisis so that we could address our main problems 
as soon as possible. 
  [Galic] We will now hear the first opinions. We have 
recorded many questions by citizens and political party leaders. 
We will now hear the first opinions and questions by party 
leaders in connection with the current crisis in the parliament. 
  [Mira Ljubic-Lorger, of Dalmatian Action] It is sad and 
almost tragic that after two years as a deputy in the Croatian 
Assembly, this is the first time that I can ask the president of 
the state a question. However, here is my question: Mr. 
President, do you not think that it is high time you stopped 
thinking what else we could take away from Croatia, but that we 
-- headed by yourself -- started thinking what we could give or 
give back to Croatia? In my opinion, we should give it 
primarily freedom, democracy, and tolerance. 
  [Tudjman] Mrs Lorger, I will answer your question by 
repeating part of it. It is sad that you ask such a question. 
If we have given anything to Croatia in the past four years, 
then we have given it freedom and democracy, despite the war of 
aggression against Croatia and despite the fact that they wanted 
to prevent the creation of the independent Croatian state. 
  We have not achieved everything that we wanted because this 
is a continuing process, but in the opinion of objective outside 
observers -- some not even favorably inclined to Croatia -- in 
many areas we have achieved more than many other former 
socialist and communist countries have done. 
  [Galic] The second question is by your former party 
colleague 
Slavko Degoricija. 
  [Slavko Degoricija, of Croatian Independent Democrats] Mr. 
President, can you use your influence to reduce the stubborness 
of some Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] negotiators in dealing 
with the current parliamentary crisis? Can you also use your 
influence to calm the media war and stop the spreading of false 
information and petty swindles until we overcome the crisis? 
  [Tudjman] It has been shown before that I really can 
influence the decisions and behavior of representatives and 
deputies of the majority party, and not only theirs. Still, we 
should admit that it was the majority party that -- in the 
interest of Croatia -- displayed flexibility and goodwill during 
the negotiations to overcome the staged parliamentary crisis as 
soon as possible. It did this in order to remove all objective 
reasons which might lead to the worsening of Croatia's position, 
the aggravation of internal problems and problems on the 
international scene, to the obstructing of the liberation of the 
occupied areas of Croatia, and to the clipping of Croatia's 
potential to exert an effective influence on solving the crisis 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which the world expects us to do. 
  Concerning the media war, neither I nor the majority party 
have a considerable influence on the work of any paper, daily or 
weekly. Many objective foreign observers -- not only from the 
media, but also from diplomacy -- say not only that there is 
enough democracy in Croatia in that respect, but that there is 
in fact too much anarchy, which is incompatible with better 
cultural relations in the civilized world. 
  [Galic] Here is the third question in this section: 
  [Ivan Jakovcic, of the Istrian Democratic Party -- IDS] Mr. 
President, do you intend to have any influence on the attitude 
of the state leadership to Istria, taking into account the 
stands of Istrian citizens who -- as we all know -- voted in a 
referendum in favor of the program of the Istrian Democratic 
Assembly? 
  [Tudjman] It goes without saying that I as the head of state 
will do everything in my power to see that the will of Croatian 
citizens is respected, but at the same time I will do everything 
in my power to ensure -- especially in the case of Istria -- the 
implementation of the Croatian state policy. As we have 
witnessed in the past, Istria was occupied by fascists, the 
Croatian people in Istria suffered enormous losses in the war 
against fascism and in fighting to join the Croatian motherland. 
Since you mentioned the last elections, we must not ignore the 
fact that the program of the IDS certainly had its positive 
points which ensured that the IDS obtained a majority, but at 
the same time that it supported the interests of those factions 
or tendencies which could threaten the survival of Istria within 
Croatia. With its ideas about a transregional Istria, about the 
demilitarization of Istria -- against the background of 
ever-present irredentist and neofascist factions which have 
recently emerged in Istria, Rijeka and Dalmatia -- the Croatian 
policy must take measures to protect Croatian interests as a 
whole, i.e. to protect its territorial integrity. The Croatian 
policy will of course protect every county and especially 
Istria, because of its historic background and the 
confrontations we are witnessing today. 
  [Galic] The second topical issue -- which gives rise to a 
question -- and about which there is no need to consult either 
political party leaders or the citizens, is the introduction of 
the kuna as the Croatian national currency. All opinion polls 
showed that there was hardly a single voice against it, everyone 
was satisfied or even proud that Croatia was getting its own 
currency. There were only questions about its name -- whether it 
should have been kuna or kruna or perhaps even krona. They say, 
Mr. President, that you had a decisive influence on the name of 
our currency. What do you think about these objections? Are 
they well founded or not? 
  [Tudjman] Perhaps my influence was decisive. I am not 
denying it and I am also not shirking the responsibility for 
this. Initially we decided to have a kruna [crown] instead of 
the politically and economically compromised dinar. But after a 
discussion we decided that -- since other countries in Europe, 
the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden, Finland, Iceland use a 
crown as their currency -- we agreed to call the Croatian 
currency in the independent democratic Croatian state by the 
name which existed in history. Kuna [marten] has been a means 
of payment in Croatia since long ago -- its existence has been 
recorded since the 11th century, 1018. The marten features on 
the coat of arms as the main symbol of the Croatian kingdom of 
Slavonia which was once synonymous with the entire Croatia. Why 
shouldn't we therefore accept this distinctive name which is a 
special feature of Croatia and which shows that Croatia had its 
own currency from Istria to Cres, the currency also used in some 
other countries, in Russia and somewhere in the west. So why 
not kuna, when it had already existed as a means of payment. 
There were attempts to introduce kuna after the creation of the 
Croatian province [banovina] in 1939, but it was opposed by both 
Yugo-unitarists and Yugo-integralists in both Zagreb and 
Belgrade. The fact that the kuna was introduced in the NDH 
[Independent State of Croatia -- Nazi puppet state] and suffered 
the fate of the NDH and the Axis is not the reason for not using 
it now, because Germany had the mark, France the franc and Italy 
the lira and none of these countries have changed their national 
currencies. 
  [Galic] Are you not afraid that in the west, in the 
countries which have not always been favorably inclined to 
Croatia, that there can be interpretations which could harm 
Croatia? 
  [Tudjman] As you can see, in serious circles in the west 
there are no objections. There is some opposition on the part 
of some individuals who have never accepted the reality of the 
free, sovereign Croatia. It is very interesting that in Croatia 
itself there is no opposition. Only two or three people dared 
express this publicly, as opposed to, I believe, 98 percent of 
the Croatian people. 
  [Galic] Do you think that the introduction of the kuna could 
hamper agreements and the negotiations with the Serbs, the Serbs 
who do not accept the Croatian state? Will that be an 
additional reason for them to say: The Croatian kuna will not 
find its way into Serbian pockets? 
  [Tudjman] Serbs in Croatia must understand one thing: They 
are a minority here, and they must recognize Croatia as their 
homeland. They can take an equal part in it -- Croatia will 
guarantee them this -- but they cannot, as they did in the past, 
impose solutions on state policy and, least of all, on the name 
of the Croatian national currency. 
  [Galic] Mr. President, you personally advocated 
rapprochement, negotiations, and the normalization of 
Croatian-Serbian relations, both in Croatia and between the 
Republic of Croatia and Serbia or Yugoslavia. 
  [Tudjman] Yes, I have been advocating that for a long time. 
I have written about this subject as well, and even today I 
believe that the normalization of Croatian-Serbian relations is 
necessary in order to solve the problem of the occupied areas of 
Croatia and to create preconditions for the normal life of the 
Serb ethnic community in Croatia. The normalization of 
relations between Croatia and Serbia on the basis of mutual 
recognition is also necessary. That is in the interests of both 
Croatia and Serbia, and that is an important prerequisite for 
creating a new international order in southeast Europe. Without 
that there can be no lasting peace, and if this untenable 
situation remains -- and it cannot remain forever -- it would be 
detrimental for both Croatia and Serbia. 
  In my books -- in "The National Issue in Europe" and in "The 
Wastelands of Historic Reality" -- I have given examples. The 
Scandinavian countries fought each other for centuries until the 
beginning of this century, until 1905 when they finally 
recognized each other, and the Scandinavian peninsula is today 
the model of friendly relations of the Scandinavian countries 
and of the respect for differences between ethnic and national 
minorities in certain countries. It is also the model of 
democracy -- we could perhaps agree -- in the most perfect 
sense. About 20 years ago I expressed the hope that once we 
would see -- I used this particular word -- the Scandinavization 
of the Balkans. No future can be built on mutual hatred between 
Serbs and Croats and on the wish to exterminate one another. 
Besides, there is the philosophy that nations and people start 
acting wisely when they use up all possible [sentence unfinished 
as heard]. 
  In that context I also gave the example of Germany and 
France. There are no two other nations in Europe which fought so 
many wars as Germany and France in the last century and this 
one. The relations between Germany and France are nowadays such 
that these two European powers are the backbone for the creation 
of the European Union [EU]; the EU in which no European nation 
will be created, but a Europe which will be a homeland to all 
peoples and all states. 
  Consequently, I believe that reason will win and that 
Croatian-Serbian relations will be normalized. It would be good 
if this happened without another war. 
  [Galic] In order to introduce Scandinavia-like relations in 
the territory of the former Yugoslavia, and for relations 
between Croatia and Serbia one day to resemble the relations 
between Germany and France, both sides should aspire toward 
that. It does not seem that the Serb side, the negotiators from 
Knin, truly wish to bring the process of normalization to an 
end. Some people want to know -- and I will ask you, Mr. 
President -- whether Croatia is perhaps giving in too much, and 
not obtaining in return what it is giving, or what it is 
prepared to give. 
  [Tudjman] First of all, let me say whether Croatia is giving 
in too much. The problem could be reduced to the question of 
why we accepted the UN-protected areas at all. 
  We accepted the peace forces at the end of 1991 when we 
wanted to get out of the war in which one-third of the Croatian 
territory was occupied, and in which that territory was 
destroyed like Vukovar and Gospic, Dubrovnik, and Konavle. At 
that time we did not have our army, forces, or friends in the 
world who would help us continue the war and prevent the rest of 
Croatia from being completely destroyed -- Osijek, Sisak, 
Zagreb, Zadar, Sibenik, Split, Rijeka, Varazdin and so on. 
Therefore, at that moment and under those circumstances, 
because of the objective balance of power in the territory of 
the former Yugoslavia and in the world, we agreed that the peace 
forces should be deployed in those occupied areas. 
  However, the basis was that these areas are Croatian areas, 
and that only the status of the Serb population in Croatia needs 
to be solved. Therefore, that was the reason for doing it, and 
some people have forgotten why it happened. It is not that the 
Croatian policy was lenient, but the objective circumstances 
forced us to do that. 
  After that, things developed the way they did. In talks with 
Serbian leaders, including [Serbian President] Milosevic and 
[former FRY President] Cosic, we aimed at creating preconditions 
for what we have already discussed -- the historic necessity to 
overcome all differences between Serbs and Croats. 
  Our explanation was that it should be clear that both Croats 
and Serbs in the South-Slav union, in the former monarchist and 
then socialist Yugoslavia had their own intentions -- and not 
all of those intentions were idealistic. It was with the help 
of the Yugoslav idea that the Croats wanted to rule Serbia, 
counting on being more civilized and more progressive. They 
failed to do that, but the Serbs used the Yugoslav idea to 
impose their hegemony. On the other hand, the Serbs did not 
manage to destroy the Croatian nation or establish a permanent 
rule over Croatia either through the idea of a Greater Serbia or 
a Yugoslav idea -- which they turned into a means of their rule. 
Therefore, conclusions should be drawn and the problem of 
normalizing relations tackled. 
  In my talks with the Serb leaders, both Cosic and Milosevic 
agreed that it was necessary and in the interests of both 
nations to normalize relations. It was along these lines that 
we opened representative offices in Zagreb and Belgrade. 
However, the Serbian representatives -- who Belgrade said would 
pursue the policy of normalizing relations -- have recently gone 
to extremes and spoken of Krajina as a separate state, which is 
a stupidity. Croatia will never agree to that, and the world 
will never accept that because the world has nowhere given 
minorities the right to self-determination. 
  The initial Serb theory was that if the Croatian nation had 
the right to self-determination and if they could proclaim their 
independent, sovereign state, then the Serbs had the same right. 
Yes, but there is a small difference. The Serbs are in the 
Croatian state, on Croatian territory which has never been part 
of Serbia. They are a minority here and, under international 
provisions on which the international order is based, minorities 
do not have the right to self-determination, while nations have 
that right. 
  Currently the relations are quite tense, but they are linked 
to solving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In any event, now 
we will see. If the Serb representatives from Knin to Baranja 
fail to accept the gradual normalization, if they continue to 
oppose Security Council resolutions guaranteeing Croatia's 
territorial integrity, Croatia will not be willing to extend the 
UN mandate and it will have to use all means to reintegrate the 
occupied areas of Croatia into its constitutional and legal 
system. 
  [Galic] Judging by some recent moves by the Croatian 
authorities, it seems that, as you have said, Croatia wants to 
bring to a head the issue of extending the mandate to the UN 
peace forces because it is obvious that further extension will 
create the situation commonly referred to in the world as the 
Cyprus-style situation, that is, a division which could be 
permanent. Croatia will not accept that. Do you feel there is 
a danger that the world would want to, or might recognize that 
Cyprus-style formula in Croatia? How will Croatia react to that? 
  [Tudjman] It would be possible to find in the world, and 
even 
in official circles in some countries, people who would be in 
favor of applying the Cyprus-style model to Croatia because they 
do not accept an independent Croatia and because of the pressure 
exerted on Croatia. However, what is important is that nowadays 
Croatia has Security Council resolutions and that we have clear 
statements by the most influential international players -- from 
the main world superpower United States to the EU, and even to 
Russia -- on recognition of Croatia's borders, and that the 
Serbian problem needs to be solved within Croatian borders. 
  Therefore, if in the current circumstances, refusing to 
allow 
the application of the Cyprus-style solution to Croatia, as you 
said, we must take, then, we can count on, and I hope that the 
world will understand that such a situation can no longer be 
tolerated, and that we will have on our side not only the 
world's democratic public opinion, but also the important 
international players [sentence as heard]. 
  [Galic] As you will see from the questions Croatian citizens 
are asking you, the Croatian public wants to know about that 
problem. [Unidentified Croatian Army soldier] Mr. President, 
as a Croatian soldier, I would like to know when we will have 
internationally recognized borders for our Croatia. 
  [Tudjman] I would be happy if I could give a date. But, as I 
said before in response to earlier questions, we are determined 
to start the process of implementing Security Council 
resolutions. Specifically, the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] 
should start implementing Resolution 769 on the control of the 
borders, and Resolution 871 on the gradual reintegration of the 
occupied areas of Croatia should start being implemented. If 
this does not happen, it is certain that, relying not only on 
250,000 refugees from those areas, but also on the whole of the 
Croatian nation -- and nowadays we also have the army which is 
ready to fulfill its tasks -- we will have to start the process 
of liberating the occupied areas. 
  [Galic] Another Croatian soldier wanted to know the same 
thing. 
  [Second unidentified Croatian soldier] Four years ago the 
Croatian banner unfurled in Zagreb. Can you promise us that it 
will unfurl in Knin before Christmas? 
  [Tudjman] I hope so. Besides, I have promised that to some 
Croatian people who were born in Knin and who remember that 
after the Second World War Croats accounted for half the 
population of Knin; now there is not a single one. I also 
promised Croatian basketball players that I would invite them 
for dinner in Knin. I hope I have fulfilled all my promises so 
far. The question is when it will happen. That does not depend 
entirely on me, but I am convinced that I will fulfill that 
promise of mine as well, and that the Croatian banner will fly 
on the fortress of Knin, on Zvonimir's royal city. 
  [Galic] One more question please. 
  [Josip Ivankovic, poet] How many more poems about Vukovar 
will I still have to write? I have said that I will write the 
lyrics for every record of the Zlatni Dukati band until Vukovar 
is free. 
  [Tudjman] Yes, Vukovar is a symbol of Croatian resistance, 
of 
the Croatian struggle to establish the independent Croatian 
state. Vukovar is a symbol of the untamed aspiration of the 
Croatian people to be their own masters, the masters of every 
inch of the Croatian land. It is absolutely certain that there 
can be no dilemmas about our return to Vukovar. We are to sing 
and fight until that day. 
  [Galic] Croatian politicians, representatives of political 
parties, are also interested in the Croatian-Serbian relations 
-- as we will see in the next two questions. 
  [Milan Djukic, of Serbian People's Party] President Tudjman 
often sends messages to the Serbian people in Croatia offering 
hospitality. Isn't this a proof that Serbs are foreigners in 
their own homeland and isn't this a support for those forces in 
Croatia who wish to divide Serbs into loyal and disloyal? My 
question is -- does President Tudjman, as the president of all 
his citizens, really think that in this way he can reintegrate 
the UN-protected areas into Croatia by peaceful political means 
and at the same time secure lasting peace and good 
Croatian-Serbian relations in this region? 
  [Tudjman] You see, Mr. Djukic, you and I have already talked 
about it, and I have said it publicly, both on official 
occasions and unofficially: The problem of Serbs in Croatia is 
very complex because in former Yugoslavia, both the kingdom and 
the socialist Yugoslavia, Serbs had a fully privileged status in 
everything, a ruling status; and not just in former Yugoslavia, 
since Hungary also used Serbs to support their rule and impose 
hegemony over Croatia. There is a saying which is historically 
and politically true: Knin ruled Croatia, its finances and its 
police, and also other things. With the establishment of the 
independent democratic Croatia, all this had to change. Right 
from the beginning, though, we held -- on the basis of our 
democratic orientation and on the basis of our knowledge -- that 
a lasting peace cannot be created amid the dissatisfaction of 
the majority of people. We offered Serbs all civic and 
national-ethnic rights. I personally sent for Professor 
Raskovic [former leader of Serb Krajina] to have talks with him 
and tell him -- let's agree on what you Serbs in Croatia really 
want -- because Raskovic was at the time a representative of the 
civic Serbian party as most Serbs in Croatia did not recognize 
those Serbian representatives who belonged to the League of 
Communists or who were members of the Croatian parliament. I 
said -- if you as the true representatives of the Knin Serbs do 
not recognize them, then you should put forward your proposals. 
Let's organize our relations in a democratic and correct way. 
You know what happened instead. The Serbs accepted the arms 
forced upon them by the Yugo-communist army. They have been 
provided with arms in those areas which Belgrade wanted to 
include in greater Serbia and in which Belgrade wanted to 
involve the Serbs in a struggle against the democratic 
authorities. This is the problem here, and not the lack of 
willingness on the part of the Croatian Democratic Union to 
grant the Serbs in Croatia all the rights they are entitled to. 
  And something else: The Serbs have become the tools with 
which to bring down the democratic authorities in Croatia, and 
to threaten the recently won freedom. And for conquering 
Croatian areas to -- as they had indicated in their maps -- the 
Virovitica-Karlovac-Karlobag line. The Croatian democratic 
authorities treated the Serbs in Croatia in an extremely 
tolerant and democratic way. The Serbs remained at the Croatian 
university, their representatives remained in the government and 
the parliament. Admittedly, the relations changed within the 
police. Instead of 70 percent, the Serbs now make up some 7 
percent of the police force, according to the latest figures, in 
particular in the most sensitive departments. This was changed 
[laughs]. But the Serbs in Croatia were given conditions for 
normal life. 
  And let us remind ourselves, when wars break out between 
countries and nations we see -- for example when the war was 
declared between the United Nations and Japan all ethnic 
Japanese were detained in special reception centers, or should I 
call them camps, their property was taken away from them. And 
they could clearly not threaten the American authorities and the 
American state to any significant extent, as it was the case in 
the armed rebellion of the Serbs in Croatia. We are still 
discovering explosive and weapons dumps, left here in Croatia by 
both military and civilian secret services which masterminded 
the action to bring down the Croatian authorities, in which the 
Serbs in Croatia were involved. 
  Therefore, the Croatian side should not be seen as guilty 
for eveything. The Croatian side is the least guilty of all and 
the Serbs must understand that. The Serbs must aspire toward 
the attitude expressed by [scientist Nikola] Tesla: He is a 
Serb, but Croatia is his homeland; he respects it and he will 
have all the rights guaranteed. The Serbs will have more 
representatives from Knin and elsewhere, as nowadays they 
already have representatives in the parliament, the Croatian 
Government, the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court and so 
on. This is something for which conditons should be created on 
both sides. 
  The lies to the Serbian population should stop. Two big 
deceptions: One that this independent, democratic Croatia is the 
continuation of the NDH, and the other that at least 600,000 to 
700,000 were executed in Jasenovac in the NDH. As you know, 
greater Serbian imperialists and hegemonists who cannot accept 
any form of Croatian identity have set that figure as high as 
1.5 million. 
  Let me tell you, Mr. Djukic and the Serbian public, during 
the Second World War altogether 597,000 people died on all the 
fronts in the whole of Yugoslavia. This includes ustashas, home 
guards, chetniks, Germans, Muslims, Slovenes, and Macedonians -- 
597,000, and this is already a huge figure. Why should they now 
build their policy toward the independent democratic Croatia on 
this and deceive ignorant Serbs from Knin to Baranja by saying 
that they cannot live with Croatia because the Croats killed at 
least 600,000 to 700,000 people in Jasenovac alone. This is 
something that should be settled once and forever. 
  There should be new foundations for life which the 
democratic 
world wants today and which, as I have just said, have been 
achieved on the Scandinavian peninsula where a Swede in Finland 
or Norway enjoys the same rights as all other citizens. We are 
ready for that. Besides, you have proofs for that as well as 
those from Zagreb University who are spreading such lies and are 
partly contributing to solving the problem of Serbs in Croatia 
in a political and democratic way [sentence as heard]. 
  [Galic] There is another question on the same issue. 
  [Ivica Vrkic, of Croatian People's Party] Mr. President, 
what 
do you think about the proposal I put forward to Prime Minister 
Velentic that a new round of talks with the Serbs be held in 
Mostar? We would thus make a concession to the Serbs -- to hold 
talks on the territory of a third country -- and at the same 
time, Croatian state interests would not be harmed because the 
talks would be held in a town which is a symbol of the struggle 
for the survival of Croats outside Croatia, and which is also 
under the international protection of the EU. 
  [Tudjman] Your idea is quite interesting. However, the talks 
with Serbs in Croatia will not be held anywhere outside Croatian 
state territory. 
  [Galic] One of the most difficult and most complex problems 
of the Croatian state today is the large number of its refugees 
who still cannot go back to their homes which are destroyed, 
occupied, or confiscated. People we have talked to and polls we 
have conducted show that impatience is rising and that the 
Croatian authorities will probably have to deal with that 
impatience more often in the near future. 
  [Tudjman] I fully understand the dissatisfaction of the 
Croatian people driven out from the occupied areas. After all, 
speaking about them, we must bear in mind that they are not only 
refugees, but also witnesses of the sacrifices they and their 
families suffered in those areas. They were witnesses, they 
watched members of their families killed, evicted from their 
centuries-old family homes, humiliated. Those people are full 
of wrath and hatred, and we have had to invest huge efforts to 
placate them and convince them that we will ensure their return, 
even to destroyed homes; that we will help them restore their 
family life, rebuild their villages, and not only Croatian ones 
because Hungarians, Czechs, Slovaks, and Ruthenians have also 
been driven out. Their dissatifaction is justified. Their 
demands and our promise to ensure their return have been delayed 
too long. 
  Therefore we are currently at the stage when we will take 
steps to ensure their return with the help of the international 
community, and -- as I said -- if we fail to obtain effective 
assistance from the international community in doing that, it is 
certain that the 250,000 refugees and the whole of the Croatian 
people will stand up with the Croatian army to liberate those 
areas and enable those people to return to their villages and 
destroyed towns -- Vukovar and Dubrovnik -- and live normal 
lives. 
  [Galic] The following questions raised by our refugee 
citizens illustrate this best: 
  [Unidentified refugee] I want to know, since we cannot 
return 
-- whether we can ever return is a major question, well, if we 
cannot return I want to know what kind of plans the president 
has for us refugees. There is a large number of us. Does he 
plan to resettle us, for example, in some Serb villages, so to 
speak, I mean the houses abandoned by the Serbs who lived there? 
Does he plan to put us up there? Does he plan to secure some 
accomodation for us anywhere? Homes and jobs, that is what we 
need. 
  [Tudjman] We have to create conditions for your return. 
Until then, we have so far been doing our best to give you the 
best possible accomodation in line with our conditions. We 
opened all our hotels. It is a perfectly certain fact that it 
is not normal, namely, that our refugees have difficult housing 
problems while somewhere there are abandoned houses. 
  It is important nevertheless that we direct all our efforts 
and political activity and that we carry out concrete 
preparations so you can return to your homes. Until then you 
might find a job through local authorities and your own 
initiative and you can feel the same way in your Croatia as you 
do in your homeland. Consequently, you have a right not only to 
life but to education and development. Precisely because you 
were driven out of Croatian territories. 
  Rest assured that we will succeed in this. This is the 
entire Croatian people's task, not only in the homeland but in 
the diaspora, too. 
  [Galic] Let us hear another question. 
  [Second unidentified refugee] My first question, the most 
important question for all of us from Vukovar is about the 
missing. What about them? When are we going eventually to hear 
true reports? All we hear is rumors. 
  [Tudjman] Dear madam, you see, in addition to the 7,000 
people who have been registered as dead, Croatian soldiers and 
civilians fighting the Yugoslav communist aggression and then 
the Serbian aggression. First, we had a list of 14,000 missing 
people. This number of missing people has been gradually 
reduced through our efforts and negotiations with the Serbs on 
the release of Croatian prisoners. We have now ended up with a 
list of 7,000 missing people. Unfortunately, today we have to 
conclude that it is likely that most of these victims of the 
aggression and bestiality of the chetnik hordes who attacked 
Croatia, there is a slim chance that a large proportion of these 
7,000 missing are still alive. 
  However, in keeping with international norms and the Red 
Cross principles, it is not possible yet to establish what has 
happened to individuals. In any case, this testifies to the 
fact that the Croatian people have suffered a great deal, not 
only the fighters, soldiers who defended, who in fact had 
emerged from civilians as fighters for Croatia's defense. The 
Croatian people as a whole have made great sacrifices in its 
struggle against the Yugo-communist and Serbian aggression. 
This is yet another reason why we must as soon as possible 
solve this problem of missing people in particular, we must as 
soon as possible finalize negotiations and solve the problem of 
occupied territories. Only at that point it will be possible to 
reveal the whole truth. 
  [Galic] Another question please. 
  [Third unidentified refugee] Mr. President, we young people 
from Vukovar want to return as soon as possible to Vukovar. We 
do not want to wait any longer for anything. We want to have 
our own homes. If you have some solution, please tell us. We 
cannot go on like this any longer. 
  [[Tudjman] I was in Vukovar in late August 1991, at a time 
when it was no longer possible to enter Vukovar in a normal way. 
I had to take country roads so I could visit those who were 
still defending Vukovar. I will return to Vukovar with you. 
  [Galic] The last question on this issue. 
  [Branko Pek, secretary of the Refugee Association] Mr. 
President, you and other party leaders have often been promising 
that refugees will soon return to their homes. Having patiently 
waited for three years, the refugees are embittered with both 
Croatian state policies and the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
as their promises have not materialized. In those eastern parts 
of Croatia an exodus took place at an even earlier stage and 
those people never returned. Is there any danger of the same 
happening to the Croat refugees? 
  [Tudjman] I have, by and large, already given you my answer 
to this question. We can indeed feel dissatisfaction with the 
UNPROFOR. The UNPROFOR has not carried out its major duties. 
But this is not a case of the UNPROFOR, as it is, not wanting 
to do so. We have to be objctive towards members of UNPROFOR 
units. Understandably, the UNPROFOR has various ways of 
relating to our problems, to the Croatian people and the Serbian 
population. What is essential, though, is this -- the UNPROFOR 
has carried out one of the key tasks. When we agreed to, and 
when the United Nations sent its protection forces, this put an 
end to the war between Serbia-Yugoslavia and Croatia. Likewise, 
thanks to the UNPROFOR we secured the withdrawal of the Serb 
army, the Yugoslav Army from the Dubrovnik area and Prevlaka. 
This was not only a result of our armed operation, which was 
the most important element, but of diplomatic activity, too, 
including the involvement of the peace force. 
  These are some things that the UNPROFOR should be given 
credit for, so to speak. However, the UNPROFOR has not managed 
to disarm, the UNPROFOR in its capacity as a peace force was in 
fact not tasked with disarming Serbian paramilitary formations. 
On arrival the UNPROFOR was tasked with keeping the peace. The 
Serbs opposed this. Not only did they oppose the disarmament of 
their paramilitary formations but they carried on with ethnic 
cleansing. 
  As far as we know, since the UNPROFOR's arrival about 650 
Croatian people have been killed in the UNPROFOR-protected 
areas. They have been killed by the Serbian occupation 
authorities in these areas. 
  [Galic] Do we know how many people have been driven out of 
these areas over this period? 
  [Tudjman] In this period, I do not know the exact figure, 
but 
Croatian people have been constantly driven out. From this 
point of view we cannot understandably be satisfied with the 
UNPROFOR. To this effect we have demanded that the UN Security 
Council give wider authority to the peace force and, 
consequently, the power to exercise this authority. 
  So far these efforts of ours have not been successful. In 
the course of these efforts we have nevertheless secured 
resolutions such as those on guaranteed borders, on the need for 
a gradual reincorporation of these areas into Croatia. We are 
now in a period when, in order to solve the refugee question and 
not only the refugee question but because of its entire national 
and state life, because of the restoration of communications etc 
-- Croatia will have to take steps to enable refugees to return 
and to reincorporate these areas either with the help of the 
peace force and the international community or on its own. 
Today, the world will have more understanding for these 
justified demands from Croatia. 
  [Galic] The next major topic to discuss on the occasion of 
Croatian Statehood Day is Bosnia, the situation there,and 
Croatian policy on Bosnia. After the Washington agreement and 
the supplementary agreement in Vienna were reached, the roots of 
the Croat-Muslim confrontation seem to have been eliminated and 
Croat-Muslim relations have reached a new phase, a phase of 
great cooperation, where conditions are to be created for 
co-existence within Bosnia-Herzgovina, a federation of Croats 
and Muslims, and, to a certain extent, coexistence with Croatia, 
in the confederation. 
  Do you, Mr. President, believe that, after what has been 
achieved at the diplomatic level, conditions have been created 
to eliminate the Croat-Muslim confrontation, if not forever then 
for a considerable period of time? 
  [Tudjman] Everything you said is true. The problem of 
Croat-Muslim relations and [pauses], if you look at it as a 
whole, the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina is objectively the most 
complicated problem in the world today, for the very reason that 
three nations are confronting each other, and not only three 
specific nations but also three civilizations. The state [of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina] was, when it was created and later 
throughout its history, not only an area of competition on an 
ethnic basis between the Serbs and Croats, but also an area 
where Muslims existed first as a separate religious and later 
ethnic community and where attempts were made to create a 
Greater Serbia by including the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 
where attempts were also made by certain fundamentalist circles 
from abroad to create a base in Bosnia-Herzegovina for an 
extreme fundamentalist policy in the center of Europe. 
  [Galic] Was this realistic? Was it possible? 
  [Tudjman] As was proven in real life -- it was not possible, 
but the danger, the tendency was there. As we are speaking 
about this, it would be difficult to understand that the world 
as it is and a disunited Europe could allow Serb aggression of 
the kind we saw -- if it had not been for the world fearing this 
danger that you have just asked about. There have been even 
some specific studies about this, both in the east and in the 
west. Some Muslim leaders, despite saying that they were 
fighting for a secular state, have given statements to the 
effect that they will create a state in Bosnia governed by 
Islamic laws, whether others like it or not. You know that this 
is also a civilizational problem of today's world, that the 
largest number of Islamic states want to have normal coexistence 
with other civilizations, but that there are also those who call 
for a jihad, a holy war to destroy other civilizations. 
  But, let us get back to concrete things. The Croatian policy 
from the beginning wanted to protect the Croatian identity as a 
whole in Bosnia-Herzegovina. As you know the Croatian identity 
is most compact in western Herzegovina, but it is also present 
in central Bosnia, Sarajevo, and in Bosnian Posavina, in the 
whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina, or in its largest part. This is 
why we accepted, and not only accepted but also instigated -- I 
personally did, the first proposals on a system of cantons, then 
on the resolution of the crisis based on the division of Bosnia 
into provinces. Understandably, we helped the formation of the 
Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna when the republic of Srpska was 
practically already a separate entity, and when the Muslim 
leadership also accepted the idea of the creation of a separate 
Muslim republic. 
  As you know, that agreement with the Serbs was signed and 
made public. Naturally, by pursuing such a policy and helping 
the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, through the Croat republic of 
Herzeg-Bosna, we managed to prevent the whole of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina from falling into the hands of a greater 
Serbia, and then to defend the Croatian areas even in central 
Bosnia. 
  There have been proposals that we can annex western 
Herzegovina to Croatia immdiately, which I rejected, because I 
considered the Croatian areas as a whole, especially the threats 
to the Croats in central Bosnia. 
  With such a policy we did not passively accept, but we 
brought about the Washington agreement [as heard]. We did not 
have to be forced to sign it, regardless of the fact that some 
individuals, even in Croatia, do not understand that. As I 
said, the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina is truly complex, and 
some people even in Croatia speak about a unitary humanitarian 
Bosnia. Some would like to annex only a part of Bosnia, and so 
on. However, in our policy Croatian national and strategic 
interests coincided with the interests of the Western world. 
The understanding that the Muslims can survive only in an 
alliance with the Croats also prevailed among the Muslims, in 
the Muslim leadership. That was the basis of the agreement. 
  [Galic] Do these agreements and the principles of the 
agreements from Washington and Vienna guarantee the realization 
and protection of Croatian national interests and Croatian state 
interests? 
  [Tudjman] Absolutely. Why? Because on the basis of the 
constitution and the constitutional principles of the 
federation, it is the first time that the Croatian people in the 
federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is in fact -- judging by 
the signed agreements and the opinion of international law 
experts; there is a document signed by American Professor Dr 
(Boyle) analyzing the whole agreement over 26 pages and in 121 
articles and proving that the federation, and especially the 
confederation, are ensuring an absolutely equal status for 
Croatia [sentence as heard]. 
  Therefore, the Croatian national entity -- both here in 
Croatia and in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- should always remember the 
heritage which speaks about and warns that the Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina have always been in a subjugated position. 
They were first under Serb hegemony when they were pushed into 
the background and eliminated even physically from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. And, recently, they have been under Muslim 
hegemony. 
  Therefore, the Croats must understand that the constitution 
on the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation grants them an equal 
position, and that they can no longer be placed in an unequal, 
subjugated position because of the equality there, and 
especially because of the confederation. 
  After all, neither the Croats in the Croat republic of 
Herzeg-Bosna nor we here would accept the agreement, the 
proposal by the United States and the important European 
players, if it had not been for the link between the federation 
and the confederation. That confederal relation between the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and Croatia guarantees that the 
Croats there can be completely equal, and that they will be 
responsible for governing Bosnia-Herzegovina in the direction of 
the interests of today's democratic world and for linking 
Bosnia-Herzegovina with western civilization through Croatia, 
despite some extremist trends. 
  [Galic] Some uncertainty and even fear is present among the 
Croats over the issue of what will happen to Croats in the mixed 
cantons, the cantons which have been declared mixed but have a 
Croatian majority. Medjugorje is a certain example where such 
concerns are present, Medjugorje which is to be part of a mixed 
canton. 
  [Tudjman] First of all, full equality is also guaranteed in 
mixed cantons. In those municipalities of the mixed cantons 
where the Croats are in the majority -- no Muslim or any other 
authority can be imposed, or any symbols etc. This very example 
of Medjugorje being in a mixed Mostar-Neretva canton shows that 
this canton, because of Medjugorje, will be more likely to be 
known as more Croat rather than as more Muslim, for the whole 
world knows of Medjugorje. I was myself surprised by how many 
people came to Medjugorje even in the war conditions, from as 
far as America, Canada, and Indonesia. This example shows that 
this canton will not be less Croat than it is Bosniak-Muslim. 
  [Galic] What will actually happen with Bosnia? Some people 
think, and a lot has been said about it in public, that there is 
some secret, or I do not know what kind of agreement, between 
you and Mr. Milosevic on the division of Bosnia and that 
everything else is just a game. Many have denied this, and many 
have spoken about it. I would like you to answer this question 
-- is there any truth about the alleged agreement on Bosnia with 
Mr. Milosevic? 
  [Tudjman] There has been no agreement with Milosevic or 
anyone else. Except for an agreement with [Bosnian President] 
Izetbegovic [laughs]. At the time when it was being said that 
the Bosnian crisis should be resolved through a union of three 
republics, I signed an agreement with Izetbegovic, now I can say 
a secret agreement, on cooperation between the Croat and Muslim 
republics within the union, and on a confederation between these 
two and Croatia. This was even signed. There has been no 
agreement with Milosevic, either written or verbal. I did have 
talks first with Milosevic and then, a few days later, with 
Izetbegovic, and then all three of us met. This was before the 
war flared up in Bosnia, when Yugoslavia had disintegrated and 
Bosnia was on the agenda. My view was: Gentlemen, let us try to 
prevent a war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for this war will have have 
even more terrible consequences than in Croatia. I said then: 
There are two possibilities to resolve the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
crisis. One is the confederal solution which would satisfy all 
three nations, the other one is the division. There is no third 
option. So, let us try a politically acceptable solution for 
all three nations. There is no ideal solution in such 
complicated conditions. This was the gist of my talks with 
Milosevic, my talks with Izetbegovic, and the talks between all 
three in Split. And there is nothing else to add. 
  And where are we today? We were in a position to create a 
union of three republics. Let us be completely open: The 
prevailing opinion among the most responsible circles of the 
world politics was that the creation of three separate republics 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina would not suitable. In some future the 
republic of Srpska would probably join Serbia, and the Croat one 
would join Croatia, and a separate Muslim one would remain, as 
we have mentioned a few minutes ago. 
  A proposal was then made, acceptable to us -- since it 
resolved the problem of Croats in general and the strategic 
interests of the Croatian state -- to create the Bosniak-Croat 
federation. And now the question of borders remains. As you 
have seen, at the latest ministerial meeting the world did not 
accept the 58:42 division. The position of the European 
ministers and Secretary of State Mr. Christopher is that the 
divison should be 51:49. In my opinion such a division should 
be executed and the republic of Srpska should then remain in 
some loose union with the federation, as a transitional solution. 
  In my opinion a solution will be found at some kind of a new 
Berlin congress. In a letter to President Clinton after he took 
office, I said that the United States should take over the 
leading role, since the European countries were not united as 
regards this, that an agreement in Bosnia-Herzegovina would not 
be easily reached, and that international circles would have to 
make a decision to even, if it needed be, impose peace -- to 
prevent a war which could in this area assume a proportion of a 
war between civilizations. Not only a third world war, but -- 
bearing in mind constant involvement of some radical, Bolshevik 
or Orthodox circles, on Serbia's side and a manifestly open 
desire by some Islamic circles to get involved on the Muslim 
side. Croatia has been and remains in favor of finding a 
political solution as soon as possible, to achieve peace and 
create conditions for a stable future international system in 
this area. 
  [Galic] Would Bosnia within this concept remain in its 
pre-war borders? 
  [Tudjman] Now, a solution is being sought along these lines 
but everyone is saying that this is a transitional solution. 
  [Galic] It seems that the Washington agreement, which was 
after all signed under U.S. patronage or under considerable U.S. 
influence, has resulted in relations between Croatia and the 
United States being elevated to a level they never reached 
before. It was you who was talking about special relations, 
about partnership between the United States and Croatia. Does 
this U.S. background, this U.S. support for Croatia, regarding 
both Bosnia and Croatia in particular, determine in a way the 
character of Croatia's foreign policy, of the Croatian state and 
its international status? Is the United States our main ally or 
partner in the world? 
  [Tudjman] Well, I think, yes. In other words, by pursuing 
this policy of ours, a principled policy from the point of view 
of protecting Croatian interests, and by bearing in mind 
international circumstances, we won not only the sympathy of the 
United States as the world's main power but also its friendship, 
something that is our greatest success. The Washington 
agreement crowned this policy. The United States indeed regards 
Croatia as a key factor in the implementation of this policy. 
Yesterday, I received not only President Clinton's 
congratulations on statehood day but also his separate letter 
about their wish to carry on with our mutual efforts to solve 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. 
  At the same time on the other end of the world there is a 
country such as China, the world's superpower with the largest 
population. We are also developing economic and cultural 
relations in the spirit of friendship. Our policy has created 
allies and friends in Europe too, not just among those who are 
traditionally inclined toward us but who demonstrated a great 
deal of misunderstanding as regards our complicated position, 
our involvement, so to speak, in Bosnia-Herzegovina.... 
  [Galic, interrupting] Are you referring to Germany? 
  [Tudjman] Yes, Germany among others. Even Germany was 
eventually convinced by my peace initiative of 1 November last 
year and particularly by my meeting with the Muslim leadership 
in Bonn, i.e. in St. Petersburg, when it was revealed what we 
were offering and when there were no grounds any longer for 
casting suspicion on this Croatian policy which had been 
continuously of such a nature, which wanted peace and 
cooperation with the Muslims and offered solutions. 
  Hence, I would say yes to your question, yes we maintain 
friendly relations with the United States in all spheres, not 
only regarding the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina but in the 
economic sphere, the political sphere and all other spheres. 
But we also have friends and allies, precisely thanks to our 
principled character. You know how the Vatican supported us. 
The Washington agreement enabled us to create conditions for 
the development of friendly economic relations with Islamic 
countries. 
  Consequently, in recent days Croatia has achieved indeed, 
your colleague, our ambassador Hido Biscevic in Ankara has sent 
a letter to me saying that there is a document that Turkish 
President Demirel, he is a statesman of great experience, has 
said that the world is witnessing, with surprising satisfaction 
and even admiration, how Croatia has been managing to win 
friends and that its policy has contributed to some prospects 
for a solution to this complex crisis [sentence as heard]. 
  [Galic] One of the party leaders will ask you a question 
about the relations between Croatia and the other former 
superpower. 
  [Boris Kandare, of Croatian Party of Rights] I would like to 
ask you what influence the Russian Federation and its policies 
will have on future political events in the Republic of Croatia 
and in Bosnia-Herzegovina and how you personally intend to 
resolve this burning issue? 
  [Tudjman] This is a good question. Russia, whether the 
Russia of Peter The Great, Ivan The Terrible, Stalin or Yeltsin, 
remains an Euro-Asian power which will have permanent influence 
in the world and even in this part of the Balkans -- although I 
do not consider Croatia a Balkan state, but a state of southeast 
Europe. 
  Russia's presence here is felt through Serbia and through 
its influence over the Orthodox population of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and Croatia. The recent changes in Russia showed that the 
Russian policy is felt to such an extent that other 
international circles, Europe and the United States, have to 
acknowledge it. 
  I can say with satisfaction that the official Russian policy 
has played a positive role in the attempts to resolve the crisis 
in the former Yugoslavia and the Serb question in Croatia. It 
was in my presence in Belgrade that a Russian representative 
proposed to Milosevic to recognize Croatia. The Russian 
ambassador to Zagreb has been to Knin and has said that the 
Serbs in Croatia have to resolve their relations with the 
Croatian authorities within Croatia. The influence of the 
official Russian policy is now positive. But, on the other 
hand, there are some extreme circles in Russia, both from old 
Bolshevik ranks and from radical Orthodox ones, who have 
supported and continue to support Serbia's imperialist policy. 
Yet, it is to be expected that Russia will continue with its 
positive policy. But also -- Russia's positive democratic 
position remains in the context of Russia's desire to secure its 
sphere of influence in this part of the world. 
  As far as we in Croatia are concerned, we have to 
acknowledge the positive role Russia has played in attempts to 
resolve the problems in the former Yugoslavia. We also have 
very intensive economic relations with Russia. As a country 
which wants to have friendly relations with all countries in the 
world we should try to develop our economic and cultural 
relations with Russia as much as possible. Despite its desire 
to have Serbia in its sphere of interest Russia will want to 
have good relations not only within the Orthodox world, but also 
with what used to be called the western Slavs. 
  All in all, we have to be not only pragmatic, but we must 
also remember that cultural links between the Croatian and 
Russian people existed [a long time ago] and that understanding 
for the Croatian problem is reflected in the attempts by Russian 
diplomats to support a right solution. 
  [Galic] You said Croatia is not a Balkan country and this 
will certainly be accepted by everyone. Croatia is a European 
country. How will the process of Croatia's integration into 
European organizations and systems -- political, cultural, 
economic, etc -- develop by the end of this year? Is it 
realistic that the Council of Europe is the first step? Is 
Croatia determined to fight for full European status? 
  [Tudjman] Absolutely. After the Washington agreement not 
only the Germans but also U.S. representatives explicitly said 
that Croatia has been accepted as a constituent part of the 
western world, western Europe. But we must be realistic here. 
Regardless of changes of government, some lasting components 
remain within European countries, which would like -- as they 
wanted to preserve Yugoslavia -- to create some new regional 
alliances. For this reason some did not want to have Croatia as 
it is. Until 1991 they did not want to have Croatia at all -- 
and some very influential circles wanted Croatia to be defeated. 
When we managed to survive they worked on producing changes in 
Croatia which would take Croatia into some new regional 
alliances in the former Yugoslavia. 
  Because of the spheres of influence, not only between Russia 
and Europe and Russia, Europe, and the United States, but also 
within Europe -- you [Galic], as a man who lived in Paris for a 
long time, know very well that there is significant difference 
between Paris, London, Bonn, and Rome...[Tudjman pauses] Croatia 
is absolutely on its way to the EU. Not only is it on its way 
but, as I have mentioned, Croatia is an important factor in the 
creation of an international order which will guarantee that no 
new twists will happen in this turbulent area. 
  [Galic] A country like Croatia, which is neither in a state 
of peace nor war, must use up a great proportion of its 
potential on financing its refugees, organizing its armed 
forces. At the same time its economic potential is not fully 
utilized. This certainly creates many social problems, some of 
which you will see reflected in our citizens' questions. 
  [Unidentified pensioner from Osijek] Mr. Tudjman, would you 
and your wife be able to survive on a pension of 750,000 
[Croatian dinars] if your household bills totalled 450,000 
[dinars]? 
  [Tudjman] Dear madam, this is too little. We cannot be 
satisfied with this. We must and will do everything to increase 
our incomes, our salaries. Then again, let us be realistic, let 
us be proud, both you and I and all Croatian citizens of having 
weathered all of this, everything we have weathered. In Croatia 
no one went hungry. There has been no shortage of fuel in 
Croatia. There has been no shortage of anything in these 
wartime circumstances. 
  Your [pension] and my salary are still better than in any 
former socialist country with the exception of the Czech 
Republic and perhaps Slovenia which is far above....[Tudjman 
pauses] Consequently, in these changes which were brought about, 
which we had to survive, understandably, we had to weather all 
kinds of things, particularly what Mirko [Galic] has just said, 
that we had to create an army under unfavorable circumstances. 
War in every country, in a country such as Croatia in 
particular, because it was occupied as a whole in the beginning 
and than one-third was ruined. [sentence as heard] It is a 
miracle that we have managed even in this economic sphere to 
avert starvation and poverty. As soon as we get out of the war, 
and even now we are already increasing salaries. 
  Private enterprises, private initiatives are being launched. 
The tourist trade is being restored, and so on. We are heading 
for higher living standards. One thing is essential, though. 
Today we have our Croatian authorities who have no other task 
but to take care of the well-being of Croatian citizens. In 
other words, we have now created a situation in which your and 
my toil and effort and that of the Croatian people is no longer 
drained down the Sava and the Danube to God knows where. 
Croatian people can find jobs where they could not before -- in 
the Croatian Army, the Croatian diplomatic service. Now, our 
destiny, our future, the issue of what kind of salaries we will 
have and what kind of culture and science, is in our hands. 
Rest assured that we are doing our best to get the most capable 
Croatian people involved in resolving these problems. 
  [Unidentified refugee] Refugees find it extremely hard to 
find a job. They would like to work. 
  [Tudjman] A job? I am puzzled, I am puzzled indeed to learn 
that refugees who want to work -- every refugee should want to 
work -- cannot find a job. In Croatia we are already facing a 
shortage of labor, a shortage not only in construction companies 
but in the tourist industry, too. Consequently, in this 
context, there are problems which we ourselves, the Croats, are 
responsible for. This is what we have to overcome. 
  So far I have only heard of obstacles facing those who want 
to return from abroad. I have had to intervene in a huge number 
of cases to enable people from the diaspora to take part in the 
privatization process, to buy these former socialist facilities 
that belong to no one, and to help them in finding jobs. In two 
cases the returnees went back to Australia and Canada after 
having experienced a cold welcome here. It was my intervention 
that brought them back. Let this be known. 
  I have only heard of such cases in which people from abroad 
face obstacles to finding jobs. Understandably, there are also 
positive cases. I know of some hundred young people from the 
diaspora who are not only employed in their own companies but 
who have found jobs after returning from abroad. One of thes 
people is a man who was born in Argentina. He works now for the 
Privatization Fund. 
  I have not, however, heard so far that you refugees are 
facing obstacles. On this occasion I appeal to all Croatian 
people in business life and the administration to give Croatian 
refugees, above all, a chance to find a job. People will find 
this burden of refugee existence less painful if they work, if 
they are occupied, if they know that they are useful rather than 
being a burden. Consequently, this is our shared issue. 
  Dear madam, not all things in Croatia are as they should be. 
This is not only a matter of political revival, of the 
implementation of the economic revival we have achieved. We 
must also bring about a moral revival, a moral restoration so to 
speak, so that we can create the preconditions for Croatia's 
integrity. For, in its history, this Croatia has never been a 
unified state. There are still regional tendencies. There is 
still mistrust, say between Dalmatians and Slavonians, or 
between Herzegovinians and Istrians, and so on. Consequently, 
we must overcome these regional features within the Croatian 
national entity that we have inherited from the past as soon as 
possible. Regional allegiances most certainly have an influence 
on whether someone gets a job or not. 
  I, for one, have intervened on a great many occasions. I do 
everything so we can achieve a state of harmony among the 
Croatian people that is demanded at this historic juncture. We 
have just established the Croatian state. It should be 
consolidated. Its stability in international terms will depend 
on this as well as on its stability in terms of finding the best 
solutions for all internal problems. There are problems in 
every country, in every society. Particularly so in our 
newly-created state because of, as I mentioned, leaving the 
Yugoslav and socialist hell. 
  [Galic] There is another similar question. 
  [Unidentified female soldier] Mr. President, has Croatia 
come 
to the point where a Croatian soldier who has been in service 
since 1991 is living on 360,000 [Croatian dinars] a month? That 
is a shame! 
  [Tudjman] I do not know your case precisely. If you are 
referring to a soldier who is capable of working and who is 
willing to work, then 360,000 is less than a living wage and 
society, our state, should find a solution for him to have a 
wage which we can guarantee. Our average wage is about 300 
[German] marks, and in many firms as much as 500, 600, 700 and 
even over 1,000 marks is paid. Therefore, it depends on 
resourcefulness, and sometimes, if someone is not capable of 
solving his problems, our social services should help him. In 
this particular case, if we are really talking about a soldier, 
I simply do not understand it. 
  [Galic] Political parties are also interested in social 
policy. You will see that party leaders are asking about the 
social situation in our country, our society. 
  [Mato Arlovic, Social-Democratic Party] What will be done to 
improve the social, financial, and equal status of workers and 
pensioners? Which measures should we take to improve the 
standards of living of a man, a worker, and his family -- at 
least to ensure respect for human dignity and the dignity of the 
family? This is my question. I believe that if the 
fragmentation of society continues, it will -- and it has 
already started doing so -- slowly start affecting the unity of 
all citizens, which could have serious implications on the 
security of the state. 
  [Tudjman] Of course, it is a task of the authorities to deal 
effectively with all social problems. However, in that respect 
we are limited by circumstances. As long as we have to earmark 
the main part of the budget for the creation of an armed force, 
an army; as long as we have to support an army three times 
larger than we would normally need; as long as we have to invest 
money in the establishing of our diplomatic service, which is 
not cheap either; briefly, as long as we do not come out of the 
isolation in which we have been so far, the possibilities of the 
state authorities are limited. 
  However, there has always been and there will always be the 
fragmentation of society. The state authorities should exert a 
positive influence, but that problem should certainly not be 
addressed by socialist and self-management phraseology and by 
giving promises and granting rights without a realistic basis. 
If we opted for a free market, we should respect the laws of 
the free market, including resourcefulness or the lack of it. 
Of course, some will become rich, some will go bankrupt. We 
cannot avoid that, especially during the period of [ownership] 
transformation. 
  But, I agree that precisely for these reasons the state 
authorities have a greater responsibility to alleviate the 
position of those in society who are most at risk -- pensioners 
and others -- in order to enable them to live a normal life and 
to create conditions for all classes, all segments of the 
Croatian people for the first time to take part in the 
rebuilding of their homeland. 
  [Galic] Mr. Pankretic will ask you a question in his own 
way. 
  [Josip Pankretic, Croatian Peasants' Party] Since you have 
appropriated land from the conglomerates as state land, the land 
has been abandoned. None of the state-owned land along the road 
from Sesvete to Vrbovec has been sown with corn, and it was not 
sown last year either. People in the villages wonder why the 
state does not sow corn when we do. That causes problems for us 
because my peasants do not sow either. Seeing that you own that 
land, would you please say something about that? 
  [Tudjman] Dear Pankretic, you cannot help acting as if you 
are in an electoral campaign. First of all, we have not 
appropriated any land for the state, but we have been looking 
for ways of privatizing former socialist large farms without 
threatening production. 
  I visited Romania recently where they took rash steps and 
reduced production by 50 percent, and the people were hungry, so 
they had to return the land. Therefore, we, the state, have not 
appropriated the land, but we tried to keep up production, and 
at the same time to privatize the farms. 
  I can give you the same answer as before: We have had such 
success that there has been no hunger, but I am sure that we can 
do more for villages. I know very well that the Croatian people 
have survived because of village life and the peasants. 
Conditions should be created for the farmers not to leave 
villages, but to stay there. We should create conditions, as in 
Denmark for example, for the farmer to be lord of his land. 
  [Galic] Many people will say that a huge, maybe the 
greatest, 
treasure of Croatia is its people, very resourceful people. Are 
they well deployed, appointed to the right positions? A party 
leader will ask you that. 
  [Jozo Rados, Croatian Social-Liberal Party] With all due 
respect to the political experience of the president of the 
republic, but stressing that his experiences stem from the 
communist system -- both as a brain behind it and a dissident 
against it -- and acknowledging that he is a scientist, I 
personally believe that the human resources of the Republic of 
Croatia should be deployed in a better way. I know how 
difficult and strenuous it is to create and govern a state. 
But, there are opinions in the public that many mistakes made 
by Croatian policy came about because the large volume of work 
and many tasks have been too much for the strength of one man. 
I would like to hear the president's opinion on these thoughts. 
  [Galic] Mr. President of the Republic? 
  [Tudjman] It seems that Mr. Rados is speaking here as a 
party 
representative. I affirm that Croatian policy has made no 
strategic mistakes either in politics or in the economy, either 
internally or in the international sphere. On the contrary, 
causing surprise, admiration, and bafflement on the part of some 
people, it has made achievements precisely because it had a 
leadership, it knew what it wanted, and it mobilized all the 
intellectual potential -- regardless of party affiliation -- to 
solve both political and economic problems. 
  One of the most complex tasks was the creation of the 
Croatian Army. From what, and against which odds did we create 
it? We managed to defend ourselves and create a force to which 
the enemy will have to give serious consideration. Look at 
Croatian diplomacy, look at those people. They are professors, 
scientists, doctors of sciences, people who have contributed to 
the victory of Croatian state policy and who are respected in 
the world. In the economy, where are those economic experts who 
have been left out? 
  So, we have achieved much, thanks primarily to a good 
personnel policy. Of course, more can and must be done, but we 
must create a climate in the whole of Croatia's public life in 
which there will be a clear difference between state interests 
on the one hand and party political -- let me not say petty 
political -- interests on the other hand. Speaking about 
Croatian state interests, no party differences should be seen in 
the activities on the international sphere. In the 
international sphere we should be united in defending the 
Croatian state and Croatian state interests. That means giving 
support to those who people voted for and entrusted their 
confidence in, and, I dare say, those who have justified that 
confidence and brought Croatia to the point where internally it 
has one of the most stable systems compared to other former 
socialist countries, and in international relations it has been 
recognized and has won the friendship of the most important 
international players. [passage omitted]

  [Text] After the session of the Constituent Assembly of 
the Federation, the Assembly of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina began work this afternoon. The agenda 
included several points, which were discussed by the deputies. 
The first point on the agenda was the determination of the 
guidelines for the continuation of negotiations and the 
nomination of the delegation for the negotiations in Geneva and 
France. Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, spoke about that. After that the deputies 
held a discussion behind closed doors at which they adopted the 
guidelines for the continuation of the negotiations. They 
endorsed the stands presented by Alija Izetbegovic, president of 
the Presidency, when he address the deputies. 
  [Begin Izetbegovic recording] Esteemed deputies, dear 
guests, we face two sets of negotiations. The first set of 
negotiations refers to the establishment of a general cease-fire 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina and are scheduled to take place the day 
after tomorrow, on Thursday [2 June]. These negotiations were 
called by Mr. Akashi. 
  The other negotiations are the continuation of the 
negotiations held in Talloires on the constitutional 
organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the further refining of the 
constitution, that is, the negotiations with Serbian side. In 
other words, they are determining the external borders of the 
federation. Therefore, there are these two meetings that are 
different in content, but are mutually closely connected. 
  Regarding the meeting that should be held the day after 
tomorrow -- as you can see, I have put this in conditional form 
of should be held, because we have made our participation in 
these talks conditional on the withdrawal of Karadzic's Serbs 
from the exclusion zone in Gorazde. [sentence as heard] We have 
been repeating this demand since we received the invitation. 
This has already lasted six or seven days. They have not 
withdrawn to this date. [words indistinct] We will wait. If 
they withdraw in the (?meantime), we will go to these 
negotiations and discuss a cease-fire throughout 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, or the end of hostilities, as they say. So, 
the condition is the withdrawal. This is the condition for our 
participation in these negotiations. If this condition is not 
met I propose that we do not go to these negotiations. If the 
withdrawal does take place, we will go. We should then present 
the following stands: 
  First of all, we are talking about a temporary cease-fire. 
Akashi has proposed that this cease-fire last four months. We 
think, I think that this period is too long and that our 
delegation should demand not a cease-fire of four months but of 
four weeks. Why? Because, whether this was Mr. Akashi's 
intention or not, but Karadzic's Serbs energetically support 
this proposal, this cease-fire could obviously turn into the 
freezing of the lines. The agenda envisages, first, the 
separation of forces, second, the arrival and interpositioning 
of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] between the warring sides, as 
is written there. All this indicates a danger and smells a bit 
of the freezing of the lines. In the situation when some 70 
percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina is occupied, we, of course, cannot 
accept the freezing of the lines. We have very bad experience, 
the world has very bad experience with the situation in Cyprus 
where the temporary cease-fire has lasted 30 years. The line 
there has virtually become the state line. 
  Of course, it would be in the interest of Karadzic's Serbs 
to 
maintain and (?prolong) even more the state of occupation. 
Therefore, if these negotiations take place, our delegation 
should primarily demand the shortening of the cease-fire period. 
Another thing, we should carefully think what to do with the 
interpositioning of UNPROFOR. 
  I think that we should start with about a four-week 
cease-fire. We could accept a six to eight week cease-fire at 
the maximum. After four months we would face, we would be on the 
verge of the winter period and, of course, fighting for the 
liberation of the occupied parts would be very difficult in such 
conditions. 
  Regarding the other negotiations, the negotiations in 
Talloires, the negotiation on refining the constitutional 
organization, the reorganization of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
agreement with the Serbian side, or, if you want, the 
determination of the external borders of the federation, I think 
that there are many ideas, and the discussion will probably 
produce even more ideas, but I would like to stress that our 
delegation should have two starting points, two bases that it 
needs to defend in these negotiations. The first is the 
preservation of the integrity of the state in every possible 
way, the preservation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state within 
internationally recognized borders. The second is what we could 
describe as everyone being his own master. This means that the 
map of the federation as envisaged in Vienna should be defended. 
In doing so, the additional provision could, of course, be as 
follows: Give the freedom to the delegation, proceeding from 
that map, to reach a certain agreement with the Serbian side. 
The delegation should be given the opportunity to be flexible 
in the talks. It should be given the opportunity, space to 
negotiate. There are various ideas here, such as the one on the 
gray zones, on [word indistinct] zone in the areas on which the 
agreement could (?not) be reached. The gray zones would have a 
special regime in them. They would be demilitarized and under 
UNPROFOR control. They would thus facilitate the realization of 
one of our important interests, if not the most important 
interest, namely that our army be deployed in these regions, or 
at least that the population return there. 
  As regards the delegation, I think that the composition of 
the delegation in both cases should be the same. I propose that 
the delegation consist of six members. Here is my proposal: 
  These should be Ganic, Zubak, Silajdzic, (?Bicakci), 
Akmadzic, and Lazovic. The delegation would be the same but, in 
the talks on the cease-fire, the delegation would be led by 
Professor Ganic, together with Mr. Zubak. The delegation in 
Talloires, in the negotiations with the Serbian side, the 
delegation would be led by Dr. Silajdzic together with Dr. 
Zubak. The delegation at the talks on cease-fire would also 
include two generals, Mr. Delic and Mr. Roso. This is my 
proposal. [end recording] 
  This is all on today's session of the Assembly of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The session will continue tomorrow at 1000.

  [Text] Zagreb, May 31 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb forces shelled 
Tuzla airport in northeastern Bosnia a few minutes after a UN 
relief plane landed there Tuesday [31 May], UN Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR] officials said here. UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi 
immediately condemned the attack and said he had protested to 
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic over the incident, which comes 
ahead of peace talks scheduled in Geneva Thursday. The 
aircraft, an Ilyushin-76 arriving from Split in Croatia, took 
off again without unloading after nine shells landed in the 
close vicinity of the airport within a 20-minute period. There 
were no casualties. 
  One of the shells landed 20 metres (yards) away from the 
emergency services' base, and another 200 metres (yards) from 
the airport's control tower, an UNPROFOR statement said. A 
radar system operated by a Jordanian contingent attached to the 
UN Nordic Battalion revealed that the shells were fired from 
Bosnian Serb position 16 kilometers (10 miles) southeast of the 
airport, the statement added. 
  "Mr. Akashi said that such deliberate targeting of UNPROFOR, 
only a few days before scheduled talks in Geneva on a general 
ceasefire agreement in Bosnia and Herzegovina, was regrettable," 
it said. "Mr. Akashi has expressed his deep concern regarding 
this incident to Dr. Karadzic." 
  Tuzla airport was targeted by Serb artillery Monday 
afternoon 
when two shells were fired at it. Previous to that there had 
been no bombardments since May 17.

  [Excerpt] While the military observers of the United 
Nations are trying to keep their promise given in the Sarajevo 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] headquarters that they will 
convince the chetnik forces not to fire (?133) mm guns and the 
M-46 and M-48, which are popularly known in the aggressor army 
as chetnik nightingales, from the village of (?Gaj) inside the 
20 km exclusion zone, the chetniks from (?Hadzici) on the other 
side have been attacking at irregular time intervals the lines 
of the fighters of the Army of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on the southern sector of the Hadzici front 
with 120mm and 80mm mortars all day today. 
  As we have learned from the command of the 9th Hill Brigade, 
19 mortar shells landed on the positions of our fighters this 
afternoon alone. They were fired from Zunovaca, which is also 
inside the 20 km exclusion zone. The village of Loste was not 
spared shelling either. It was hit by five shells. [passage

  [Excerpt] Attacks on the free territory of Gradacac have 
lasted all day, since early this morning. The projectiles from 
all types of weapons are showering the positions of our fighters 
and the central part of the free territory. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Three tanks and numerous 
mortars, guns, howitzers from all the well-known chetnik 
strongholds took part in the attack today. After two infantry 
attacks had been successfully repelled, with the enemy suffering 
major losses, artillery continued to attack the town and the 
entire front. These attacks are mainly indiscriminate, nervous, 
and without a particular aim. Stunned by yet another defeat, 
the Serbo-fascists have been pounding the town all afternoon.

<F P=106> [Sead Turkovic report from the Information Service of the </F>
1st Army Corps] 
  [Excerpt] The Sarajevo region has been relatively quiet 
today. The aggressor is sporadically targeting the lines of 
defense with small arms. A mortar shell fired from the chetnik 
position exploded in Zagorska Ulica. The same happened in 
Dobrinja and Vrbanja Most. 
  The situation on the Ilijas front is again flaring up. After 
a brief lull, the chetnik artillery at Krnjaca, [word 
indistinct], Medojevici, and [words indistinct] became active 
with full force. From these positions, the regions of Mosevicko 
Brdo, (?Poret), and Milovac were hit with several hundred 
artillery projectiles of various caliber from different 
artillery pieces. At the same time, the aggressor also fired 
over 500 projectiles on Vrhove, Visicko Brdo, and Borovo Brdo 
from Nobozice, Kamenicke Stjene, and Dubine. The latest reports 
from this front indicate that the chetniks are continuing 
deploying new artillery pieces and bringing fresh forces, 
because in their four attempts to penetrate our defense 
positions at Taracin Dol they suffered considerable losses and 
were pushed back to their initial positions [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 1 June carries in its 
regular 7-minute newscast two reports on the combat situation on 
the Brcko and Gracanica fronts. 
  Brcko correspondent Hamid Deronjic reports that "the Serbian 
aggressor's provocations that characterized the day [31 May] on 
the Brcko front intensified during the night. In the evening 
hours, the chetniks used 62 and 80-mm mortars, Tromblon 
grenades, and infantry weapons to pound the Brcko defense 
positions. On several occasions, the chetniks from (?Lipe) 
opened fierce fire at the central part of the defense. At 2115, 
the enemy used a hill gun to shell the wider area of Bajici but 
to no avail. The first morning hours on the Brcko front are 
marked by the Serbian aggressor's small arms' provocations, 
which are particularly pronounced in the region of Djukici. The 
defenders are not responding." 
  Izudin Durakovic, the correspondent from Gracanica, 
recapitulates the situation on the front in the past 24 hours 
and adds that "the shelling from howitzers, tanks, and Bofors 
from [name indistinct] and Besanj continued in the evening 
hours. Enemy vehicles were on the move throughout the day, 
bringing in fresh forces and hardware. In the 117th Lukavac 
Brigade theater of operations, the chetniks used a Broving and 
anti-aircraft guns to shell Malinjak. The night was more quiet 
than usual for this part of the front."

  [Text] During a routine check of a UN Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR] vehicle at the Kasindol Street checkpoint, civilian 
and military police of the Serbian Republic discovered a group 
of people that are strongly suspected of smuggling on behalf of 
the current authorities in Sarajevo. 
  Among the detainees is also an UNPROFOR member. The 
detainees were carrying a large amount of foreign currency, and 
it has been established that the suspects were charged with 
purchasing equipment for the army and the police of the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and that they had set off for the airport 
with this intention, from where they were supposed to fly to 
Zagreb. As the incumbent offices have reported, six people have 
been arrested and detained in prison, among them (Angelo 
Andrea), an Italian citizen who was in charge of the liaison 
with correspondents in the UNPROFOR civilian sector. 
  The search has established that Savcinovic, Cakovic, and 
Kujic all possessed UN press cards, while, as he claims, he had 
the card of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees from the 
Muslim government because he was in charge of control of 
humanitarian cargo in Frankfurt. [sentence as heard] A letter 
was also found on Halilovic, which claims that Operation 
Parachute will be stopped in a month. An investigation is under 
way.

  [Text] The Croatian dinar together with the German mark has 
today remained a means of payment in Herceg-Bosna. The kuna and 
the [smaller denomination] lipa have not yet arrived in the 
markets and shops. However, the withdrawal of the Croatian 
dinar from circulation has started at the financial transactions 
bureau. All those with accounts with the bureau are paying 
their last deposits in Croatian dinars and are drawing cash in 
kunas. This is why it is so busy at the bureau's main Mostar 
branch. 
  While citizens are curiously comparing the new currency note 
with that of the German mark, and some even with the old kuna, 
it has to be said that from tomorrow they will be able to change 
dinars for kunas in business banks. The exchange will be 
possible until 5 June and the Croatian dinar will finally be 
withdrawn from circulation on 30 June, according to the 
Herceg-Bosna government's decision. Also according to the 
government's decision, the German mark and the U.S. dollar will 
be official means of payment, together with the kuna.

  [Text] Zvornik, May 31 (TANJUG) -- The massive mobilization 
of civilians for the Muslim forces is underway in the territory 
of the U.N.-designated safe area of Tuzla in northeastern 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, TANJUG learned from Bosnian Serb military 
sources on Tuesday [31 May]. Muslim military authorities are 
again forcibly mobilizing Serbs, escorting them under armed 
guard to mobilization sites, says the Bosnian Serb army 
statement which warns that representatives of the United Nations 
Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) and foreign reporters in Tuzla are 
not reacting to these activities. 
  All six Muslim safe areas in the former Yugoslav republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina should have been demilitarized in spring last 
year. Meanwhile, Muslims continue artillery attacks on Serb 
villages and army positions on Tuesday, Bosnian Serb military 
sources have said. Muslims are firing at Serb villages and 
positions in the area of Doboj in the north and in the area of 
Sokolac, Han Pijesak, Vlasenica, Sekovici and Zvornik in the 
east, the statement says. 
  In the area of Mt. Ozren, the Bosnian Serb army has thwarted 
an attempt by a Muslim terrorist-scouting group to infiltrate 
the area, says the statement. In the area of Velika Kladusa in 
western Bosnia, forces loyal to Muslim fundamentalist leader 
Alija Izetbegovic are building up their hardware and rallying 
terrorist groups in the area of Velika Kladusa, preparing a 
decisive attack on this town which is the center of the newly 
proclaimed Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia, the local 
Muslim radio in Velika Kladusa said on Tuesday. 
  Muslims in western Bosnia-Herzegovina, who were against the 
war-mongering policy of Izetbegovic, proclaimed autonomy in 
September last year, distancing themselves from the decisions of 
Sarajevo's Bosnian Muslim leadership. Heavy inter-Muslim 
conflicts have been underway in western Bosnia since that time, 
because Izetbegovic sent his army to stifle the new autonomy 
`using all available means.'

<F P=106> [Report by Z.L.: "Kolodziejczyk Is Like a Raindrop"] </F>
  [Text] "We do not really like the concept proposed by NATO, 
which stresses the precedence of Poland's economic integration 
with the West and envisions the road via the West European Union 
and only then rapprochement with NATO as the first step. We 
recently talked about this openly in Brussels," we were told by 
National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk, who along with 
Aleksander Luczak, deputy prime minister and national education 
minister, signed at the National Education Ministry [MEN] 
yesterday an agreement on interministerial cooperation. 
  According to Kolodziejczyk, military integration with 
Western 
Europe must take place simultaneously with economic integration, 
and it should be even more rapid. The minister said that he is 
determined to force this stand and be as consistent as "a 
raindrop that is persistently eroding a hole in a rock." The 
Atlantic Cooperation Council should give some thought to the 
most recent proposals by Russian Defense Minister Grachev 
concerning the extension of CSCE activities; however, work on 
such concepts should not be a mechanism blocking the processes 
of integration of some countries with proven systems in the West 
European security. 
  National Defense Committee [KOK] Secretary Jerzy Milewski, 
who took part in the meeting in MEN, said yesterday that most 
probably next week KOK would hold a session, which was announced 
at the last meeting of the government. One of the issues to be 
discussed at the session is, among other topics, the 
controversial issue of the position of the head of the General 
Staff. The national defense minister is of the opinion that 
even in a short transition period -- for a year or two -- the 
issue should be regulated, before it is finally decided in the 
Constitution. This view is shared by Milewski. "Today the 
situation is still unsteady; everything depends on the current 
opinion of the president or the members of the government," he 
claims. 
  According to the first deputy minister of national defense, 
on the basis of the Small Constitution it is not possible to 
take any radical steps aimed at clearing any doubts concerning 
the issue of subordinating the General Staff head. Therefore, a 
compensatory balance will be unavoidable. "The minister bears 
constitutional responsibility for the ministry that he is in 
charge of, including the Army, and these prerogatives cannot be 
changed for the time being. Political agreement between the 
Belveder and the coalition concerning the inviolability of the 
Small Constitution is in force," says Milewski. "The president 
is also responsible for the Armed Forces because he is the 
commander in chief. The fact that the president appoints the 
General Staff head after consulting the minister -- not at his 
request -- leads us to conclude that the legislator wanted to 
guarantee the president `direct transmission' [as published] to 
the Armed Forces, not merely as general supervision through the 
minister." Milewski believes that during a calm, rational 
debate, after the "issue is positioned" properly, it will be 
possible to reconcile all the stands, and satisfy the needs of 
both the Belvedere and the government. Political conclusions 
might be included, for example, in an interim law on the office 
of the minister of national defense and the office of the head 
of the General Staff.

"`Solidarity' Is Weakened, OPZZ Will Not Act Against the 
Government"] 
  [Text] After the weekend, which was dominated by trade 
unions -- "Solidarity" ["S"] staged a demonstration and the 
All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ] held its Third Congress 
-- the government can be satisfied. As a result of the protest, 
which began in February, "S" has become considerably weaker. In 
OPZZ Ewa Spychalska is the top dog, and it has become clear that 
the union will neither leave the Democratic Left Alliance nor 
organize any protests against the present government. 
  The demonstration of "S" was attended by... 
<H5>  Fewer Unionists </H5>
  ...than had been announced by the union's leaders. "All of 
Poland will go there," they said; during the demonstration they 
stated that there certainly are as many of them as there were in 
the February rally. At that time 27,000 persons participated in 
the demonstration; on 27 May there were fewer persons. 
  It seemed that after the strikes, which were not so great, 
not "nationwide," not so "general," after the lost battles with 
the government, "S" would like to attract as many persons as 
possible to the demonstration heading for the premises of the 
Office of the Council of Ministers; it seemed that it would want 
to do that to show its strength and to shake its fist at the 
government -- for the last time before the second stage of the 
protest action. This is not what actually happened, though. 
One can claim, of course, that it is not "S" itself that is to 
blame for what went wrong -- because for example, the General 
Directorate of the Polish State Railroads made the consequences 
of the strike of the railroads workers easier to endure for the 
people. It is also possible that, as Krzaklewski says, "if 
there had been a strike fund in every enterprise, every second 
company would have stopped work"; it is possible that to blame 
are "the people with portfolios, travelling all over the country 
and putting out strikes with pay raises"; it is also possible 
that work forces and the trade union itself are simply 
responsible and know which enterprises can go on strike, for how 
long, and when. One thing that is certain is that the leaders... 
<H5>  Were Saying More Than Was Actually Happening. </H5>
  They discredited themselves and their actions by referring 
to 
short breaks in work, rallies, and collections of money for the 
strike fund as "nationwide and general" actions. 
  "They should not have come here all the way from Gdansk and 
have said at rallies: We will force the authorities to pay for 
the strike," said one mining activist. Lignite mines extracted 
this pay "from the throats of the authorities," and so did zinc 
and lead mines, probably resorting to threats, because they 
suspected that the "S" leadership is too weak and the 
authorities of the Republic of Poland are too strong. 
  Hard coal miners agreed to join the strike, but supported 
only the demands of their own branch -- they did not back the 
slogan "a million for the bottom, a half million for the top." 
It seemed that when they get what they want and achieve 
political success, they will resign themselves to the lack of 
pay for the strike. On the other hand, the government has 
always paid and this was promised by the "top" of "S." There 
was no fund, no support; the promises turned out to be empty. 
Therefore, miners, just as many other enterprises in Poland, 
felt deceived by their own people. They were not numerously 
represented at the demonstration -- only the representatives of 
several mines participated in it. There were fewer people 
because... 
<H5>  Since January They Had Already Become Tired </H5>
  ...of the action, which was constantly being discussed. 
Those who did come, however, were more determined and more than 
ever had their gaze fixed on the chairman, who "folded up the 
umbrella," cut the union off from parties, politicians, and the 
president. 
  In the meantime, there are rumors that Silesia -- the main 
force of the union -- is getting ready to have certain things 
explained. Less than fifty percent of all mines took part in the 
strike. The present heads of the regions and of the mining 
secretariat at first implemented the decisions of the National 
Committee; however, toward the end of the action they showed 
impatience. All the other mines are said to sympathize with the 
former authorities; therefore, in the present strikes strength 
in bargaining about the region's stand was shown. 
  The second stage of the "S" protest action consisted of 
"legal interventions" in all establishments; the union started 
this stage weaker than it was before the strikes; it found 
itself helplessly asking the question: What should be done next? 
  Let us now analyze... 
<H5>  What Happened at Third OPZZ Congress. </H5>
  It is worth recalling that last year Ewa Spychalska gave the 
government from three to six months to begin implementing the 
election program. OPZZ stressed the necessity for full 
valorization of disability and retirement pensions, as well as 
the annulment of the enterprise tax on above-normative pays 
[popiwek]. Next the union voted for the budget on condition 
that it was amended. After the Third Congress practically 
nothing changed within OPZZ. Ewa Spychalska easily maintained 
and consolidated her leading position. Generally, OPZZ does not 
want to leave the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] or protest 
government activities -- it wants to negotiate. This is the most 
important issue. For those who carefully followed the course of 
the congress sessions, the rest of the decisions remains in the 
sphere of rhetoric (at the congress unequivocal declarations 
were made that "OPZZ will not be an umbrella for any 
government," and that unionists would demand full valorization 
of retirement and disability pensions, and oppose the new 
enterprise tax on above-normative pays and insufficient 
expenditure on the budget sphere). Both before and after the 
congress... 
<H5>  The Government Was Not Overly Concerned </H5>
  ...about the demands and declarations. There is no 
valorization; the government wants the new enterprise tax on 
above-normative pays to stay (even though Prime Minister Pawlak 
once again did not make a clear statement on that). Deputy 
Prime Minister Kolodko told the unionists that the amendment of 
the budget is now neither possible nor necessary. If there is 
such a possibility, the changes will be only minimal. 
  In addition, Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and 
finance minister, (in his speech, which was very good) 
provocatively asked the unionists for advice: 
  Should the taxes, raised in 1994, be decreased, with all the 
consequences for the budget sphere? Should they be maintained 
at the present level? Or should they be further increased? 
  This statement caused consternation in the conference hall: 
It was clear that the unionists of the industry and the 
unionists of the "budget sphere" are aware of two different 
answers. Taking advantage of the situation, the deputy prime 
minister asked whether it would be a good idea to limit the time 
of work and the salaries in regions that are particularly 
threatened by unemployment, and to employ more people there. 
"Because this is what solidarity is about." There was no 
answer. Kolodko promised that, if the budget is amended, he 
would ask unionists who should be given the additional several 
billions of zlotys (he knew that the line of the people whose 
interests the congress participants represented would be long 
and that the interests would be conflicting). 
  There was no discussion with the deputy prime minister, nor 
were there any statements of dissatisfaction. 
<H5>  Following the Old Custom... </H5>
  ...the participants started to clap their hands. The same 
was done after the speeches of other officials, even though they 
mostly complimented OPZZ. After the guests left, the 
participants of the congress, again following the old custom, 
adopted several resolutions demanding many things from the 
government. Assurances were given that OPZZ would also be able 
to stage a strike and that it would not serve as an umbrella. 
The decision was made to form an union circle within SLD 
(incidentally, all the time during the conflict with Stanislaw 
Wisniewski, who was forming his own faction, Chairwoman 
Spychalska claimed that such a circle had existed for a long 
time). 
  Thus, the course of the congress does not suggest that OPZZ 
will make any changes in the policy that it has been carrying 
out thus far.

  [Text] Czestochowa, 30 May -- The government will not hold 
bilateral talks with any trade union, Leszek Miller, labor and 
social policy minister, announced at a news conference in 
Czestochowa today. 
  According to Miller, the aim of Solidarity is not to hold 
negotiations on their demands, for which the best place would be 
a the tripartite commission, but to bring about negotiations 
solely between the government and Solidarity. The demonstration 
in Warsaw on 27 May was held in order to achieve this, among 
other things. 
  "The government will not conduct any bilateral talks with 
trade unions. First, there exists a third party, namely 
employers. Second, the government cannot conduct separate 
negotiations on similar demands with a different trade union 
confederation on each occasion. Taking into account the number 
of trade union confederations, the government would do nothing 
but negotiate and would not have time to implement anything," 
the labor minister said.

<F P=106> [Report by P.W.R.: "Coalition Has a `Strategy for Poland'"] </F>
  [Text] The government of the coalition of the Democratic 
Left Alliance and the Polish Peasant Party has worked out a 
"Strategy for Poland." It is a plan which, according to Deputy 
Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko, can result in an increase of 
the GDP by as much as 22 percent within four years. The real 
consumption is supposed to increase by more than 10 percent, as 
is the number of work places. The plan is to be discussed at the 
next session of the Council of Ministers. Next week it is to be 
debated in the Sejm. The deputy prime minister also stated that 
"today there is neither a possibility nor a necessity" for 
amending the budget. The deputy prime minister announced all 
this at the Third Congress of the All-Polish Trade Union 
Agreement and received a thunderous ovation. 
<H5>  What the Plan Contains </H5>
  According to Kolodko, the new government plan includes all 
Poles, even though this does not mean that everyone will be 
happy. He added that it is the human being, not the money, that 
is the central point of the new strategy. 
  The plan envisions a processes of deregulation, 
decentralization, denationalization, and lessening the 
participation of the state in the economic life, said Kolodko. 
  The strategy for Poland consists of a key program whose 
theses put the main emphasis on the following: Lowering the 
social costs of reforms, creating a strategic concept (rapid 
economic development, systemic and economic stabilization, 
improvement of living conditions for the people). These theses 
are broken down into 10 main programs: 
  1. Shaping of modern work relations and regulation of 
remuneration.2. Reform of the system of social 
insurances.3. Combating unemployment.4. Development of 
rural areas.5. Investment in human capital.6. 
Improvement of the efficiency of the management of state-owned 
property; ownership transformations.7. Development and 
reform of the financial sector.8. A medium-term financial 
strategy.9. Security of the economic exchange and absorption 
of the gray market.10. Competitiveness of the Polish economy 
in foreign markets. 
  These programs are then divided into more specific and 
detailed programs; the ideas of previous governments were also 
taken advantage of in the preparation of these programs. 
  The deputy prime minister explained that everyone will be 
able to benefit from the reform of the social insurances; 
however, this will be possible only after "more than ten years." 
He gave assurances that "the government will carry out a policy 
as a result of which unemployment will be dropping." He 
promised that "in the long run, investment in human capital 
(education, science, culture, health protection) is looked upon 
by the government as one of the springboards of development; it 
wants the share of the budget expenditure for these four areas 
to increase." He stated that the economic sectors will be 
treated equally and that the areas of state-owned property will 
be separated. According to him, the inflow of foreign capital 
is to be treated as an instrument for improving the Polish 
economy. 
  The strategy for Poland proposes a solution, whereby in the 
regions that are particularly threatened by unemployment the 
time of work should be shortened: more people would have jobs, 
but naturally the salaries would have to be smaller. 
<H5>  What the Plan Will Yield </H5>
  According to Kolodko, the "Strategy for Poland" will result 
in an increase in the GDP "perhaps even" by as much as 22 
percent within four years. It is also to be expected that real 
consumption will increase by more than ten percent; this 
increase should not omit any social groups. It will create new 
work places; the strategy will also result in economic and 
systemic stabilization. 
  "The coalition government proposes a strategy for Poland. It 
is our option which the people will or will not accept. We do 
not claim that there are no other options; however, we do claim 
that this one is the best." 
  Kolodko called the strategy for Poland "the result of four 
trends": social listening ("we are listening to what the people 
are saying"), economic professionalism ("we will only promise 
solutions that are possible to implement, because this coalition 
will give such promises as were given by some of the previous 
governments"), pragmatism, and conciliation ("we are proposing a 
program that all Poles can reach agreement over"). 
<H5>  Revision of Budget Not Very Likely </H5>
  The deputy prime minister said that there is no additional 
money in the budget, although he conceded that receipts are a 
little higher than expected. 
  "A revision of the budget will be made this year, if there 
is 
such a possibility and necessity. Today there is neither such a 
possibility nor necessity. If such a possibility appears, the 
shifts will be minimal. I will ask trade unions for advice as 
to how these several trillion zlotys, if they appear, should be 
spent."

<F P=106> [Report by Adam Uklanski from Frankfurt am Main: "Commercial </F>
Banks Are Listening; Polish Proposals Described as `Fair and 
Realistic'"] 
  [Text] On Monday, a freeze of the trade in Polish 
debt will take place. Private banks which are members of the 
London Club should decide on a formula for the debt reduction by 
29 June. The first presentation of the Polish proposals took 
place in Frankfurt am Main, with the participation of 
representatives of German, Swiss, and Austrian banks. 
  The final date for the signing of an agreement between the 
Government of the Republic of Poland and the London Club, was 
announced as well -- it will take place in Warsaw on 13 
September, followed by individual agreements with each of the 
500 commercial banks which are Poland's creditors. Krzysztof 
Krowacki, the government plenipotentiary in negotiations with 
the London Club, has announced that work on creating legislative 
opportunities for investing bonds in Polish companies subject to 
privatization, should be finalized at the beginning of next 
year. By signing the agreement -- Krowacki added -- the banks 
are making an investment in Poland, but they will also benefit 
from Poland becoming a permanent element of the European 
economy. This is not irrelevant to the banks concerned because 
the new business will compensate very significantly for what 
they had lost in connection with the debt reduction. 
  Ernst-Moritz Lipp of Dresdner Bank who is heading the 
negotiations of the London Club's working group stressed that 
unlike agreements on debt reduction with Latin American 
countries, the agreement with Poland sets no upper limits and 
the choice of the way of debt reduction is completely 
unrestricted. In Krowacki's assessment, there is a danger, 
theoretically speaking: If choosing the "buy back" [preceding 
two words in English] formula means that 20 percent of the 
entire debt would have to be bought back (about $2.5 billion), 
then that would be the upper limit of Poland's repayment 
capabilities. However, so much attention should not be directed 
at cash because in the unanimous view of the bankers present at 
the meeting, bonds are "more attractive." Krowacki announced 
that Warsaw will buy "collaterals" [preceding word in English] 
in the form of U.S. State Department bonds, which will 
constitute a guarantee of the Polish Government's repayment 
capability and which should increase the credibility of the 
operations for exchanging credit bills of exchange in return for 
parity and discount bonds; the operation is scheduled to begin 
31 October.

<F P=106> [Report by Marek Jaslan and "Kraj": "Guests From IMF Are </F>
Coming; There Are Big Chances for Concluding an Agreement"] 
  [Text] Marcus Rodlauer, IMF's representative to 
Poland, assesses positively the principles of the government's 
economic policies for 1994-97, as well as the National Bank of 
Poland's [NBP] monetary policies. But a lack of salary controls 
in state-owned enterprises is cause for concern for Rodlauer. 
According to him, this creates a danger of a price rise. 
  An IMF mission is coming to Poland tonight on a two-week 
visit. It will be headed by Michael Deppler, a deputy director 
at IMF's European Department. The IMF representatives will be 
conducting talks at the individual ministries. The goal of the 
talks is to become familiar with the current economic situation 
in Poland and also with the government's economic principles for 
the future. This is to lead to the signing of another agreement 
between Poland and the IMF. There is a chance that this might 
take place as early as August. Such a view is expressed among 
others by Marcus Rodlauer, IMF's representative to Poland. 
  One of the items on the agenda for the IMF mission will be 
to 
become familiar in detail with the economic program that was 
recently presented by Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister 
and finance minister. According to Marcus Rodlauer, the 
assumptions made in the program -- that is a rise in the GDP by 
22 percent by 1997, and also a single-digit inflation figure in 
the same year -- look quite realistic. 
  While assessing Poland's current economic situation, 
Rodlauer 
told ZYCIE WARSZAWY that Poland is one of the few European 
countries with this kind of economic growth rate. "That is why 
one must assess the government's economic policies positively," 
Rodlauer added. But there are still a number of problems that 
the government will have to overcome, like the high inflation 
rate, agricultural issues, or state-owned enterprises. 
  Salary policies are one of the most important issues to be 
discussed by the IMF mission. Over the recent months, salaries 
in state-owned enterprises were rising fast. Therefore, the IMF 
experts will try to find out how the government intends to 
control salaries over the next few months and over the long 
term. According to Rodlauer, ignoring the problem may cause 
danger to the economy. A high, uncontrolled rise in salaries, 
may bring about a lower rate of economic growth, and may also 
become the reason for a price jump. 
  Rodlauer has high praise of NBP's monetary policies. In his 
view, the policies were consistent and cautious over the last 
few months while the reduction in the denomination of the zloty 
[elimination of the four last zeros] which is being planned for 
the beginning of next year, should contribute to an increased 
trust put in the currency.

<F P=106> [Report by "J.S.": "European Transportation Market -- A </F>
Door Left Ajar"] 
  [Text] The countries of the European Communities 
deliberately protect their own carriers. Practically anyone can 
enter our country, and without paying attention to legal 
provisions -- said Transportation and Maritime Economy Minister 
Boguslaw Liberadzki. 
  According to the minister, the countries of the European 
Union [EU] should express a political will -- followed by 
practical steps -- aimed at eliminating any form of 
discrimination of carriers from Central and East Europe. 
  Transportation is regarded as a major source of revenue for 
the budgets of Western countries and that is why it is well 
organized while shipping companies have excellent canvassing 
networks at their disposal. Foreign TIR [International Road 
Transport] cars which bring merchandise into Poland, also carry 
goods on their way back in 85 percent of the cases, which makes 
the entire operation cost-effective. Our drivers on the other 
hand, carry just air on their way back, as a general rule. A 
small number of strong shipping companies has assured a 
dominating position for themselves in the European market. They 
themselves set prices which they all adhere to, while leaving a 
small space for small, local carriers. The Western shipping 
market is protected -- among other things -- by EU legal 
requirements concerning shipping companies' financial resources 
-- which are different than our legal provisions -- and by high 
technical standards concerning the vehicles' construction and 
equipment. 
  We cannot agree to this kind of terms. We stressed these 
issues strongly during a European Conference of Transportation 
Ministers in Annecy, France which took place in the last days of 
May -- said the chief of our ministry. During the conference, 
the Polish representatives supported an initiative aimed at a 
gradual liberalization of legal provisions concerning 
international transportation. We need a few years to adapt to 
those provisions.

<F P=106> [Report by Renata Wrobel: "Public Opinion Research Institute </F>
for RZECZPOSPOLITA; The Left Goes Up, Peasants Go Down"] 
  [Text] The most surprising result of the latest opinion 
poll on Sejm election preferences is the low position of the 
Polish Peasant Party [PSL], which received merely 12 percent of 
the "votes." This is half as much as the score of the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] (a considerable improvement of 
its position in comparison with April), and only a little higher 
than the result of the Freedom Union [UW]. The rating of the 
latter is much lower than might be expected if we simply added 
former supporters of the Democratic Union [UD] to the supporters 
of the Liberal-Democratic Congress [KLD]. The center right is 
hardly making up for the losses that it incurred in last year's 
elections. The poll was carried out at the request of 
RZECZPOSPOLITA by the Public Opinion Research Institute [PBS] in 
Sopot in mid-May. 
<H5>  Disillusioned Peasants </H5>
  After gaining favorable (24-25 percent) ratings at the end 
of 
last year, the support for SLD has been at the level of 20 
percent since January; in May, however, it "went up" quite 
noticeably. The increase in the electoral popularity of the 
left coincided with a decrease in the number of supporters of 
the other government coalition member -- PSL. The decrease in 
its popularity had been continuing for several months then; 
however, since January it has plummeted by as many as 5 
percentage points. 
  The opinion has become quite popular that PSL is in a 
luxurious situation in comparison with other Polish political 
parties, because it has an exceptionally stable and faithful 
electorate, which consists first of all of peasants and 
inhabitants of rural areas. As this opinion poll suggests, 
however, this may turn out to be only an illusion. The 
disillusionment of the peasants toward PSL is quite clear; the 
popularity of PSL in this group is obviously decreasing. 
  Figures speak for themselves. As recently as December and 
January, 59 percent of peasants would have voted for PSL; in 
March -- 52 percent; in April -- 46 percent; and in May -- only 
38 percent. Every fifth peasant would now prefer to back SLD, 
every eighth -- Polish Peasant Party--Peasant Accord [PSL--PL]. 
Among the persons who supported PSL in the September elections, 
nearly 60 percent of the respondents would make the same 
decision today; however, almost one in five would now back SLD. 
PSL also ceased to be the most popular party among the 
inhabitants of rural areas: it can count on the support of 21 
percent of the representatives of this group, whereas SLD can 
count on 24 percent. 
  In the electoral "local" polls, the rating of PSL is still 
quite good. This may mean that many voters separate the party's 
policy on the state level from the moves made by popular local 
activists. 
<H5>  Two Plus Two Does Not Necessarily Make Four </H5>
  Those who thought that the merger of UD and KLD would 
immediately ensure the new party at least a 20-percent support, 
as it was suggested by the last ratings of UD and KLD, can speak 
about disappointment. The result achieved by UW is much poorer. 
Some voters most certainly did not accept the merger; others 
are waiting for programmatic and tactical corrections; still 
others are simply not very familiar with the name. For the time 
being the hopes of the leaders of the new party are not coming 
true: The leaders are hoping that their party will attract 
persons from outside UD and KLD, even though it must be admitted 
that the number of former voters of the Non-Party Bloc in 
Support of Reforms [BBWR] who now declare support for UW has 
slightly increased. 
  In accordance with earlier guesses, the UW is a 
particularly popular party among the youngest respondents, 
well-educated persons, persons with good incomes, persons in 
high posts, school and university students, as well as 
inhabitants of big towns and cities. Most of the September 
supporters of UD (63 percent) and KLD (67 percent) are ready to 
vote for the new party. An interesting thing is that persons 
working "on their own" do not really burn to support UW, which 
is contrary to the image built up by the KLD circles. They more 
readily declare support for the Labor Union [UP] or SLD, and 
equally readily for BBWR and the Confederation for an 
Independent Poland [KPN] (private entrepreneurs are a group 
characterized by probably the most diversified party 
preferences). 
<H5>  Dissatisfied Head for SLD </H5>
  Talking about electorates. It is worth noticing a certain 
process that can be observed among the voters of SLD. The 
grouping is losing supporters with higher education (at the end 
of last year it would have received the support of 35 percent of 
the representatives of this group; now -- only 24 percent) and 
persons in high posts (34 percent and 20 percent respectively). 
The party is becoming increasingly popular among voters with 
elementary education, manual workers, especially unskilled 
workers, persons with the lowest incomes, as well as senior 
citizens and disability pensioners -- that is, part of the 
classical "dissatisfied electorate." 
<H5>  The Center of the Table More Stable </H5>
  The popularity fluctuations are far smaller outside the 
first 
three positions. For the last several months UP has regularly 
achieved the level of 8 to 10 percent of the "votes"; BBWR and 
KPN -- from 4 to 5 percent each; and the Union for Real Politics 
is slowly joining this group. The exception is "Solidarity" 
["S"] the rating of which noticeably increased in May. 
Incidentally, its rating has improved four times since the 
period immediately following the parliamentary elections. Only 
the next poll will show whether this increase, probably caused 
by the latest "offensive" of the union, will be lasting. "S" is 
now particularly attractive for voters with vocational 
education, with an income ranging between one million and one 
and a half million zlotys a month per capita, and for unskilled 
workers. 
  The greatest losers in the September elections -- the 
parties 
of the center right -- are regaining their influence rather 
slowly. The five groupings that were taken into account in our 
poll (the Center Accord, Christian-National Union -- ZChN, PL, 
UPR, and Movement for the Republic) jointly receive 14 percent 
of the "votes," whereas right after the elections, in November 
last year, the result was 12 percent. However, the relation 
between such simple addition and the actual influence of a party 
that is formed as a result of a possible merger is shown by the 
example of UW. 
  Materials used in the report include opinion polls conducted 
every month by PBS for RZECZPOSPOLITA; the last one was carried 
out on 14 and 15 May (a 1,010-person representative sample of 
adult inhabitants of the country).

  [Text] As you have been informed in our newscasts, Safet 
Zhulali, defense minister of the Republic of Albania, took part 
in the annual meeting of defense ministers of NATO and the 
countries of the Partnership for Peace [PFP]. 
  In his speech at this meeting, Minister Zhulali said that 
the 
Republic of Albania attaches special importance to cooperation 
with NATO. He said that the support and signing of the PFP at 
the highest level by President Berisha is a further element in 
the framework of cooperation, thus granting a possibility to 
prepare the Albanian Army on the road of accomplishing one of 
the most important goals in Albania's foreign policy, that of 
membership with full rights in the Alliance. 
  Underlining the situation in the region for a permanent 
solution to the problem of Bosnia and for a practical and 
preventive stance by the international community so as not to 
allow the spread of conflict to Kosova and beyond, he expressed 
the readiness of the Albanian democratic government to fulfill 
the obligations that derive from its presence in the cooperation 
process with NAKSI [expansion unknown] and PFP, as well as the 
determination of the Republic of Albania to be a factor of peace 
and stability in the region and Europe.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of </F>
Kosovo, by Elida Bucpapaj in Tirana; date not given: "The 
National Cause Is Very Tangible"] 
  [Text] [Bucpapaj] At the end of the international 
conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina, Warren Christopher announced 
that "the question of Kosova is being examined as part of the 
efforts to prevent the conflict spreading." Is this not very 
little, or does it conceal a subtext? 
  [Rugova] It is not little, because you are aware of the 
stance of the United States, declared by President Bush and 
subsequently by President Clinton and his administration, that 
it will not allow a conflict in Kosova or Serbian aggression in 
Kosova. I was personally pleased that this statement was also 
made on the occasion of the conference and before the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina contact group. As Mr. Christopher said, the 
problem of Kosova is, of course, the focus of 
conflict-prevention meansures, and it is important that it was 
mentioned in this situation, because I also sent a letter to the 
contact group recently, urging them to consider the issue of 
Kosova. These are, therefore, matters that should develop and 
should be watched, but I repeat again that it is of ultimate 
importance that the issue of Kosova was mentioned here too. 
  [Bucpapaj] Mr. Rugova, I believe that your Gandhi-ism is now 
well understood after a 26-month-long massacre in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. What may the future show us? 
  [Rugova] Indeed, there has been understanding for what I 
call a peaceful movement, which some others call Gandhian, 
others political, and so forth. It is a good thing that it has 
met with international understanding. Of course, this has 
yielded its own results. The cause of Kosova has been affirmed, 
as has the Albanian cause. Albania's opening and involvement in 
international institutions have also been very important. As 
for the future, in the situation in Kosova today, we can 
continue to not respond to provocations, because it is in the 
Serbian interest to start a conflict, after which we do not know 
what would happen. You see the case of Bosnia. The war started 
easily, but is difficult to stop. It is therefore very hard and 
unpromising for the Albanians, but the organization we have 
achieved and our parallel systems and institutions have enabled 
us to survive and to resist, of course with optimism that the 
issue of Kosova will be solved. However, this will be a process 
of talks and negotiations. I can say that I expect a better 
future, but we must work. In politics, I favor tangible action, 
every day building a little something, so that step by step we 
create elbow-room under that savage occupation in which we find 
ourselves. 
  [Bucpapaj] Mr. Rugova, do you think that Britain has 
abandoned its traditionalist policy after Douglas Hogg's visit 
to Kosova? 
  [Rugova] Following the contacts we have had with Mr. Hogg, 
his visit to Albania two years ago, our meeting in London last 
December, and his recent visit to Prishtina, I can say his visit 
was very important as a significant gesture. It was not merely 
symbolic that he came to Kosova, because he visited all the 
centers, the capital cities, of the former Yugoslavia. I can 
say that Britain has shown great understanding of the Albanian 
cause and the issue of Kosova. Britain, as you know, is very 
well aware of the Albanian problem and the problem of Kosova. 
One hundred years ago, even at the time of the League of 
Prizren, Britain had very clear ideas about the unification of 
the Albanian territories; however, at that time, we were very 
weak diplomatically and politically. Today, Mr. Hogg said that 
we was interested in finding some solution for Kosova and in the 
start of some sort of dialogue and discussion. This was indeed 
his main aim, like that of many European countries that are 
interested in mediating and assisting. His presence in 
Prishtina was therefore important. 
  [Bucpapaj] Mr. Rugova, the 26-month-massacre in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina openly shows indifference at the highest 
international level. But, on the basis of the results of the 
Geneva Conference, with regard to territorial relations, what is 
your prognosis for the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Rugova] It remains to be seen whether or not 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will remain the same state as it was when it 
was recognized, whether it will be partitioned according to the 
Bosniak-Croatian agreement on a federation and later a 
confederation, or whether this process of internal unification 
and further confederation will continue. Indeed I think that the 
international community is making efforts to stop the war once 
and for all and then see -- but, as we see, it is very 
difficult. We can say that now that the war has begun it is 
difficult for the world to involve itself and, of course, states 
are wary of entering into a conflict whose end is unknown. The 
question is now whether Bosnia- Herzegovina will be divided or 
will remain, and whether the international community and the 
United Nations will remain true to their principles regarding 
countries or various territories they have agreed to protect. I 
also see this as a long process. 
  [Bucpapaj] In the light of history, mentioning here the 
League of Prizren in 1878, 1912, 1945, and so forth, Albania has 
had many historic opportunities, lost opportunities. Now, 
thanks to democratic processes, do we have a new historic 
opportunity? 
  [Rugova] If we look at matters so simply, we might consider 
these, from the perspective of today, as lost opportunities, but 
I mentioned earlier the League of Prizren and the years 1912, 
1913, 1919, and 1945. It is a fact that today we are in a very 
different situation, I mean regarding Albanian potential. 
Kosova, even though occupied, has intellectual potential. The 
Albanians are no longer 80 percent illiterate as they used to be 
throughout the Albanian lands. However, today, we are also 
more-or-less handicapped because we have been invaded and 
subjugated; Albania has been isolated for 50 years and has been 
economically backward, i.e., with many problems, without 
contacts and friends. Friends are very important. However, in 
the last few years Albania has also revived and has opened up 
and become stronger. We in Kosova have asserted ourselves as an 
international entity, and so on, step by step. We must first 
create sympathy, then friends, and there is the chance today for 
a comprehensive Albanian policy. We possess diplomacy, which, 
although young, we are attempting to turn into an Albanian 
diplomacy. It is important to be organized and to have a 
thoroughly democratic orientation, because it seems to us that 
the word democracy has become a slogan for us. We must 
therefore preserve the democratic mechanisms that operate in 
Albanian society in Albania, in Kosova under the present 
circumstances, and in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM], because democratic mechanisms ensure that 
the cause advances in an organized fashion. Today, we must draw 
lessons from what we may call these past opportunities, although 
they have their own place in history. Even the League of Prizren 
created an international precedent and raised demands; the 
Albanian problem was put forward for the first time, as the 
Ottoman Empire began to fall apart. In 1912 and 1913, we 
remained as a movement. It is another matter that we were not 
prepared and had no historical experience, but now let us draw 
lessons and not allow such situations to repeat themselves. Let 
us also take 1945, when territories were divided and redivided, 
what was Yugoslavia was federalized, and the borders between 
Italy and the former Yugoslavia were changed. In this sense, we 
must draw lessons. Even in the efforts we are making today, we 
must do something for the future. As a generation, this burden 
has fallen to us, as in 1945, 1913, 1918, and 1986. We have an 
advantage and must use this opportunity to the utmost. There 
are therefore many opportunities for cooperation between these 
democratic mechanisms in Kosova and Albania. Of course, the 
economic revival coming to Albania is a very important factor. 
Even in Kosova, under these conditions of occupation, people 
are making ends meet; there is an economy, and there is human 
solidarity. Similarly, let us use the diaspora for our common 
good and organize it. In all events, it is an opportunity. Now 
I do not want it to remain a mere opportunity, and let us keep 
it open. 
  [Bucpapaj] Even after Mandela's victory in South Africa, a 
typically colonial apartheid system like that in Kosova exists 
in the middle of Europe. Will a limit be reached here? 
[sentence as published] 
  [Rugova] This is happening. This apartheid is continuing and 
being strengthened in Kosova. Of course, it will have limits 
and I hope that it will not persist like in South Africa. This 
is not a racial apartheid, because both we Albanians and the 
Slavs are Europeans. However, it is an ethnic racism, and we 
see tragedy in Bosnia, Croatia, and also in Kosova, where there 
is emigration because of repression. We are working to ensure 
that it does not last long, and it is important today that 
international attention is focused on this apartheid and 
discrimination in Kosova and has called it by its true name. 
  [Bucpapaj] Mr. Rugova, your frequent presence in Tirana 
suggests the coordination of viewpoints and options with the 
policy of Tirana. Can you add something here? 
  [Rugova] Perhaps this is not the first time, but it is the 
first time in 50 years, if not since 1918, that we have begun to 
work together in the political sphere. This is very important. 
As you know, since 1918, and indeed since 1912 and 1913 when 
Kosova was invaded, under Montenegro, Serbia, and the former 
Yugoslavia we have unfortunately never had positive cooperation 
with the mother country. Even the war ended without any 
cooperation, if we look at matters as events. Now we have 
managed to create this cooperation. President Berisha, myself, 
and the Albanians in Macedonia now act. It is extremely 
important that we should meet and contact each other. Of 
course, in the last few years, I have passed through here almost 
every month, because that is the way I travel for security 
reasons. Sometimes I joke that Tirana Airport is the safest in 
the Balkans, but there is another side to this. It means I 
travel on Albanian soil. However, it is very important today 
that we see each other, meet, and create a comprehensive 
Albanian policy. It is good fortune that President Berisha, the 
Albanian Government, the parliament and the people support 
Kosova. There is understanding, and this is guarantee enough. 
We must continue in this direction. 
  [Bucpapaj] Mr. Rugova, do you place any hopes in the results 
that will emerge from the census of the Albanian population in 
Macedonia? 
  [Rugova] The problem of elections is still being discussed. 
I do not know if any decision has been made to announce this 
census, which was to be held in June. It would be a good thing, 
and I have spoken with Albanian political parties and groups in 
Macedonia about this, to be organized, for the Albanian deputies 
who are in power, and the Albanian ministers too, to make 
preparations to ensure that there is as little rigging as 
possible, as little speculation as possible, and for the real 
figures to emerge. I have asked for, and we are working for, 
the best possible preparations, whether this census is to be 
held in June or in the autumn, because it is a census to be held 
under international supervision and on this census will depend 
the involvement of the Albanians in the institutional structures 
of the Macedonian state as an ethnic and Albanian community on 
its own territory. We must, therefore, be serious. 
  [Bucpapaj] Mr. Rugova, what advice would you give this 
pluralist and multiparty newspaper in Albania in this tragic 
situation that has overtaken the Balkans? 
  [Rugova] Since we are all in this maelstrom, I pray to God 
that we will emerge from this situation as easily as possible, 
because wars today, as we see in Bosnia, are tragic. The 
weaponry is not equal, and it is not an equal struggle. As I 
said earlier, we have found ourselves in a very serious 
situation and must be careful in everything. As for Albania, I 
think that the results of the last two or three are very great. 
We must all understand that we too, beyond the current borders, 
are concerned and watch Albania in admiration for every effort 
it is making. I think that a sound basis has been created, and 
that good democratic, institutional, and economic foundations 
have been laid. Every month in the last two years, I have 
noticed changes, economic revival, and willpower among people. 
Of course, we cannot expect changes within one or two years, 
but sound foundations are being laid. Albania and all Albanians 
have now accepted pluralism. Here we must find paths of 
coordination, harmonization, and agreement. Of course, if we 
mention the government's position we must realize that these are 
elections for a four-year or eight-year mandate. The political 
parties, groups, and associations must make efforts to prove 
themselves, not to bring down so-and-so or to back so-and-so. 
They must prove themselves, always within that mighty structure 
we call the national cause, which I do not wish to remain a 
slogan, a romantic phrase, or a piece of socialist romanticism, 
but something tangible. The national cause is very tangible, 
and we must see each other, meet each other, and travel, 
breaking down these borders and within them building an Albanian 
society wherever we are. We must therefore find an 
understanding, despite the difficulties, and I again say, not as 
a slogan, that we must work continually. Understanding is the 
basis of national interests. Among ourselves, we are all of one 
blood, one people. However, like a family, we must find 
understanding; otherwise we cannot get on. This is also the 
basis of democracy and the basis of society, but I believe that 
we are successfully taking the first step.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kujtim Ymeri, member of the Management </F>
Council of Albanian Radio-Television, by Ilir Keko in Tirana; 
date not given: "Albanian Radio-Television Is Politically 
Partial and Not Independent"] 
  [Text] [Keko] It has now been some time ago since 
numerous remarks appeared in the press regarding our national 
Radio-Television's position and role. Do you think these 
remarks are fair? 
  [Ymeri] Unfortunately, the activities of RTSh [Albanian 
Radio-Television] deserve most of the remarks, not only those of 
the press, but also those of our political and cultural 
personalities and of international bodies or their 
representatives. 
  [Keko] How would you, briefly, summarize some of RTSh's 
shortcomings? 
  [Ymeri] A shortage and distortion of information, the 
barring of alternative opinions, and an open political stance. 
  [Keko] Let us take the issue of information.... 
  [Ymeri] It is very difficult, if not impossible, to learn 
from radio and television information programs what is going on 
in Albania. In these programs you can find virtually all the 
meetings of our president, our prime minister, and other 
ministers; you can learn that a minor thief or ordinary murderer 
has been caught, you hear every single declaration of the 
Democratic Party [PD] and its offshoots, you can follow rosy 
reports on Albanian existence, but serious events of our 
political, economic, and social life are either passed over in 
silence or viewed according to the official version. I do not 
know a single case of our television having taken the lead with 
its own information or any example of professionalism having 
prompted a RTSh journalist to refute official communiques with 
actual facts. 
  [Keko] Do you think it is a matter of a lack of 
professionalism? 
  [Ymeri] No. I think that in spite of the massive purges 
that have occurred among the RTSh journalists, there are still 
many capable journalists left who like their profession and know 
it well. The same thing can be said about the newcomers. You 
can of course come across incompetent journalists, uncultured 
ones, some of whom are running important departments. But it is 
not here that the root of the evil lies. In the final analysis, 
one can blurt out the truth. The principal reason for this 
situation is that RTSh's activities are subject to strict 
political censorship. 
  [Keko] You spoke about RTSh's political stance and the 
exclusion of alternative opinions.... 
  [Ymeri] ...which are not only an infringement of the law, 
but also a violation of the basics of a democratic state. It is 
a known fact that RTSh's microphones and cameras are closed to 
any kind of criticism of the state or to any alternative way of 
thinking about politics, economy, and international relations. 
They are closed to the opposition and forbidden for prominent 
figures of our culture, even to august and respected 
international bodies, if they give vent to "heretical" opinions. 
  The RTSh has, on the one hand, undertaken, in an 
illegitimate 
way, to "denounce" all the activities of the opposition forces, 
but on the other hand, it never acknowledges their legitimate 
right to express their own opinions. 
  The European Parliament endorsed a special resolution on 
Albania underscoring the violation of basic human rights and the 
freedom of the press, but the RTSh kept silent for a time, 
pronouncing itself only after governmental bodies reacted by 
putting together their response to the resolution in a 
remarkably primitive style. Let us compare this fact with the 
ridiculous hullabaloo that we heard about a survey carried out 
by Euro-Barometer. 
  Here is another example: Let us remember Professor Rexhep 
Qosja's criticism of the policy of our government and president. 
The RTSh did not publicize a single article by R. Qosja, whereas 
it was quick to broadcast, with gleeful alacrity, our 
president's reaction to his criticism. We can therefore safely 
affirm that our "national" RTSh has declared a total embargo on 
Professor Rexhep Qosja ever since. 
  Still another example: Several months ago, the doors of the 
RTSh were open to Mr. Kalakula, who was one of the PD's top 
leaders. Nobody even ventured to censure his fascist-type 
declaration made in parliament. However, these ever-growing 
contradictions with the PD sufficed to make him a target of 
smear statements and accusations, broadcast by the RTSh. 
Personally speaking, I do not feel the least sympathy for 
Kalakula's political viewpoints. Nevertheless I cannot help 
admitting that he should have been given the right to respond to 
those attacks. 
  [Keko] What then should be, according to you, the RTSH's 
role in Albanian political life? 
  [Ymeri] As an impartial institution, the RTSH cannot remain 
outside politics, neither can we ask for such a thing. The RTSH 
must, however, be an objective mirror of our political life, 
reflecting the stands of different political forces, both for 
and against the government, without ever undertaking to play the 
role of a referee in the competition among political parties. 
  In reality, however, just the opposite is happening, a 
typical example being the way how they went about the "Nano 
affair." It remains a fact that the RTSH went out of its way to 
keep Nano's trial hush-hush, and those who were looking forward 
to following this event with interest were disillusioned. If 
"smothering" Fatos Nano's declaration was, technically speaking, 
an easy thing to do, the pains taken to back up the indictment 
and the judicial bench were really heroic. I can imagine the 
fatigue of editing, making "cuts" and "patchwork" phrases in 
order to concoct a chronicle that was the fruit of betraying 
one's profession, civil honor, and dignity. 
  It seems to me, however, that we are asking too much from 
such department heads and journalists, who never dared to rise 
up and voice their support for their colleagues sacked by the 
RTSh, for their fellow-professionals who were put in prison. 
Besides, they did not utter a word in support of one of their 
colleagues who was beaten up by the bodyguards of some 
government dignitary. It, therefore, comes as no surprise that 
one of the these maltreated journalists puts together servile 
commentaries on Fatos Nano's trial. Under such circumstances, 
there is simply no room to speak of human dignity, let alone 
professionalism! 
  [Keko] Who is running the RTSH, according to your opinion: 
the president, the government, the PD, or someone else? 
  [Ymeri] I do not see any essential difference within this 
trio. Their policy is the same, their goals also. It is 
natural to think that the branch that has got most weight in his 
trio is the one that decides. One thing is clear; when you see 
the RTSh's teams running after the PD leaders escorted by a 
suite of ministers, and following their every step, when you see 
press conferences and reports on visits concocted on no criteria 
whatsoever, it becomes evident that the RTSh has been relegated 
to the position of a private taxi: Aside from the fact that, in 
this particular case, it is the state that pays for the petrol. 
  [Keko] What would you say about the Management Council's 
role? 
  [Ymeri] The Management Council has almost been converted 
into a formal rubber stamp. Its rare meetings are postponed 
indefinitely, especially in moments of political "crises." All 
important issues are resolved outside this council and more 
often than not its members are confronted with a fait accompli. 
The same thing happened with the dismissal of the RTSh's 
employees. Naturally, we, I and other of my colleagues, voiced 
our concern and objections at our council's meetings, but the 
result was such as you can see for yourself today. 
  [Keko] Do you think the RTSh is heading for a new cycle of 
single-party propaganda? 
  [Ymeri] A tendency toward control, circumscription, and 
censorship is becoming more and more evident. We can compare 
the present with the past, but not the monist [single-party 
rule] period. In this respect, the fact should be mentioned 
that, as far as economy is concerned, the state compares the 
present situation with that of 1992, whereas when it comes to 
democratic freedom and rights it makes comparisons with 1989. 
Let us now compare the RTSh of 1991 with today's RTSh. There 
is no doubt that, even though we were just coming out of a 
period of single-party rule, the degree of freedom of speech and 
information we enjoyed at that time was higher than today. 
Thus, ever since, we have been heading for restrictions on the 
freedom of information and the expression of opinions. The RTSh 
is on the verge of being converted into an entirely party and 
government instrument. I believe and hope however that this 
will not happen. I am even certain that the RTSh will soon take 
the place it deserves in our country's political life and 
national culture. 
  [Keko] Do you base your belief on the prospect of a 
forthcoming political change? 
  [Ymeri] Not only on this. It is everybody's feeling that 
the number of those who have remained disillusioned by the new 
situation, who are tired of trials and discrimination, of 
demagogy, and unprincipled political life, is growing rapidly. 
This will, of course, lead to political changes, which will 
create a new climate in the state-owned RTSh's activities. I 
entertain this belief, relying also on a number, by no means 
small, of journalists of this institution, who, regardless of 
their convictions, have their own viewpoints, which differ a lot 
from those of the RTSh's present leaders and controllers. I 
hope that the changes in the RTSh's activities will precede the 
political change you were speaking about. Professional 
journalists always have a lucid and incisive intuition, enabling 
them to properly distinguish the requirements of the time. 
  [Keko] Now a question about the RTSh's satellite program: 
Word reaches us that this programme is threatened with closure 
and that the RTSh has run up a debt of $600,000 because of 
satellite transmissions. Is it so, or what is the truth? 
  [Ymeri] As far as I know, the problem is not so dramatic. 
At least at the Management Council's meeting, where this 
problem was discussed, it was not treated in such tones. It is 
true that there are financial difficulties. Here I want to 
explain that, according to the contract concluded between the 
RTSh and the Radio-Television of Kosova, the transmission 
expenses would be borne by the latter and not by the RTSh. As 
our Kosovar colleagues explain, these financial difficulties 
have emerged as a result of the fact that the bank accounts in 
the countries where the Kosovar emigrants are living have been 
delayed. It has been impossible therefore to collect their 
financial contributions to the desired degree. There is no 
doubt that the closure of this program would be regretful, and I 
hope this handicap will be overcome. I would like however to 
add in this respect that improvements in the RTSh's programs 
will certainly boost the interest of the Albanians living 
outside our state borders. Here I have in mind what I already 
mentioned above: If there is discontent about the RTSh in 
Albania, it cannot happen otherwise in the diaspora or elsewhere.

<F P=106> ["km"-signed report: "Experts Believe the Presence of the </F>
United States in Europe Is Necessary"] 
  [Text] Prague -- Experts from the Institute for 
International Relations claim that the only security guarantee 
for the Eastern European countries is the presence of the United 
States in Europe and partnership. If, for any reason, the 
influence of the United States abated, the entire Europe would 
be, according to them, in a security vacuum, and only the 
Western European Union led by Germany could assume the 
initiative. Diplomats and military experts believe, however, 
that this organization is not a sufficient counter force to the 
military power of Russia. 
  Moreover, the German concept of European security might lead 
to the transformation of the region of Central and Eastern 
Europe to the sphere of economic, cultural, and eventually also 
political influence of the FRG. 
  Nevertheless, the experts, who prepared the documentation 
for 
the government analysis of the security situation, expect that 
the security of Europe will continue to be guaranteed, above 
all, by the North Atlantic Alliance. The security system in 
Europe will be, according to them, with the highest probability 
connected with the U.S. concept of the European and world 
security. 
  The analysis allows for only a marginal probability that the 
world could again become bipolar. This could occur only if the 
democratic development in Russia slowed down or turned around 
and, at the same time, NATO could not be transformed. "The 
security of Central European countries would thus become for the 
North Atlantic Alliance, from the point of its own security 
interest, irrelevant," the experts claim. The possibility that 
the development in Europe could be significantly affected by the 
power aspirations of Russia is, according to them, not likely. 
  Another of the not very likely alternatives mentioned in the 
analysis could occur if the great powers -- the United States, 
Germany, Great Britain, and Russia -- agreed on a system of 
balance of power and interests on the European continent. Under 
these circumstances, the small countries would be eliminated 
from the decision-making process, and their future would depend 
on the situation worldwide.

  [Excerpts] [Stahlavsky] [passage omitted] Regarding our 
relations with Russia. You have met Andrey Vavilov, first deputy 
finance minister of the Russian Federation. How happy are you 
with the attitude of our former big brother to the debt owed to 
our small country, particularly as this debt is not negligible, 
if we take into consideration the size of our country. Is there 
not a danger that by having our debt repaid we will get 
ourselves into a new form of dependence on Russia? 
  [Klaus] Somebody keeps going on about this. I must be really 
arrogant, as everybody says, because since 15 May I have 
repeatedly said that any sort of dependence on Russia is 
completely out of the question. No one would dream of it. I do 
not know where this idea has come from. We are simply trying to 
get something back for our debts; this is our only aim. We have 
no other conditions and Russia does not attach any. I think 
this is really a fabrication by some politicians, perhaps Mr. 
Daniel Kroupa or someone. [passage omitted] 
  Russia has enormous debts, and not only to us. Its total 
debt is a hundred times bigger than what it owes to the Czech 
Republic. It must repay it at some point. We cannot have any 
illusions that Russia would repay us earlier than the rest of 
the world -- we are not the center of the world. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec by Milos </F>
Sklenka; place and date not given: "Supporting Export Is Part of 
Diplomacy, but the State Cannot Conduct Trade on Behalf of 
Enterprises"] 
  [Text] [Sklenka] After the former Federal Ministry of 
Foreign Trade had been abolished, jurisdiction over the control 
of foreign trade was divided between several sectors, one of 
which is the Foreign Ministry today. Setting aside the fact 
that foreign partners very often do not know whom to address, do 
you not think that the control over this vital sector of the 
national economy has lost some of its operational effectiveness 
and efficiency? 
  [Zieleniec] I resolutely reject the use of the term "control 
of foreign trade," since the conditions for the functioning of 
the entire economy, and foreign trade as a part thereof, have to 
be created in cooperation among many ministries. Specifically, 
foreign policy creates general prerequisites for the development 
of trade, it opens political opportunities, and sees to it that 
our entrepreneurs are not discriminated abroad, and so forth. 
  This, however, has nothing to do with the control of foreign 
trade. The control of foreign trade is exactly what we had here 
in Czechoslovakia under communism. The fact that we have got 
rid of it shows how far we have progressed in economic and 
institutional reforms. If we want our foreign trade to become 
an organic part of our economic life -- which is based on 
private initiative -- then we have to create equal conditions 
for both foreign and domestic trade. 
  [Sklenka] I do not want to argue about little words, but a 
number of post-communist countries, and also industrially 
advanced countries, have, within the framework of their state 
administration, certain bodies for controlling foreign trade at 
their disposal, such as ministries of external economic 
relations. 
  [Zieleniec] A ministry of external economic relations is 
something other than the Ministry of Foreign Trade. In the 
Czech Republic, too, it ensues from the law on power-sharing 
that the Foreign Ministry has within its jurisdiction, among 
other things, the coordination of external economic relations. 
It is a question of how the state administration is organized, 
whether it establishes an independent body for this purpose, or 
not. 
  It is also true that many countries have a different opinion 
on this matter, above all, other postcommunist countries that 
had ministries of foreign trade in the past. In most cases, 
they have kept them. If we look at them more carefully, 
however, for instance, at Poland -- which even has the Central 
Planning Commission -- we will see that the institutional 
structure in these countries is directly connected, to a certain 
extent, with the state of reforms there. 
  [Sklenka] Let us return to the direct connection between 
trade and diplomacy. Without doubt, foreign trade is an 
inseparable part of foreign service. How does the Foreign 
Ministry want, in this connection, to support Czech exports and 
open new markets to our exporters? 
  [Zieleniec] The role of diplomacy is immensely important in 
that respect. First, it is necessary for the foreign service to 
exactly monitor the political and macroeconomic situation in 
other countries, and be able to point to the opportunities that 
exist for the expansion of Czech trade on the markets there. At 
the same time, it is necessary to secure an efficient 
information channel so that required information might get, as 
fast as possible, to the hands of not only the state 
administration bodies, but, above all, to our entrepreneurial 
public. Either directly, or through the Economic Chamber, the 
Union of Industry and Transportation, stock market, or other 
institutions. 
  I consider the propagation of the Czech Republic abroad to 
be 
no less important in the work of the foreign service. This not 
only applies to general information, but also to specific 
business opportunities, conditions for investors, legislative 
regulations for conducting business on the Czech market, and 
establishing joint firms. 
  [Sklenka] Much has been said about the fact that, apart from 
the representative offices, this function will be secured by the 
so-called Czech Centers in the future. 
  [Zieleniec] Yes, these organizations, founded by the Foreign 
Ministry, will function on semi-commercial basis. It signifies 
a certain transformation of our former cultural centers into 
information and commercial centers. Their task will be to 
provide not only general information about investment 
opportunities in the Czech Republic and about the export and 
import conditions, but, on the basis of demands by specific 
entrepreneurial entities, also to organize industrial 
expositions, secure public relations, and mediate marketing 
studies for state institutions, as well as for private 
entrepreneurs. 
  [Sklenka] The Czech Centers, if the entire project is 
implemented as planned, are certainly an appropriate step on the 
way to a more specific definition of the Czech proexport policy. 
Up to now, we have had such centers, de facto, only in former 
socialist countries, and not the capitals of industrially 
advanced countries that are centers of world trade. In view of 
the fact that our export is mostly oriented toward the West, we 
need them precisely there. 
  [Zieleniec] Of course, under socialism we had centers in 
Sofia, but not in New York, in Warsaw but not in Paris, we had 
them in Budapest, but not in London. This is why we are trying 
intensively to remedy this situation, without abolishing the 
existing network. Due to the fact that the centers are being 
established on the basis of intergovernmental treaties, they 
enjoy certain advantages abroad, advantages that a regularly 
registered firm does not enjoy there. The Czech Republic is a 
small industrial country that is dependent on wide contacts with 
the world. Our open foreign policy and liberal trade policy 
correspond to this. 
  [Sklenka] Despite the fact that our trade policy is 
liberal, many people believe that it is not proexport enough. 
Czech exports may have grown by more than 18 percent last year, 
nevertheless, their structure has only slightly improved and 
still remains on the level of a developing country. In exports 
to the OECD countries, machines and equipment represent only 
some 22 percent of the overall volume. What does the government 
want to do about this? 
  [Zieleniec] Within the framework of support to export, the 
state furnishes the entrepreneurial sphere with very important 
public goods [verejny statek], which is the koruna's proexport 
exchange rate. This precisely was, and still is, the engine of 
the enormous boom in Czech exports. It is a great advantage 
that the state deliberately tries to maintain our foreign trade 
as a dynamic element in the development of the Czech economy. 
  [Sklenka] However, the koruna's proexport exchange rate has 
fallen by about one-third during past three years, and is still 
falling, which is a proof that this comparative advantage is 
only of short duration. Do you not think that the state should 
do something more for restructuring exports [komoditni 
reorientace] and making exports "healthier?" 
  [Zieleniec] Yes, proexport tools such as the insurance of 
exports, long-term export loans at competitive interest rates, 
etc., we mentioned very frequently, but, today, we have 
institutions for this purpose. Apart from the functioning 
insurance company EGAP, Ceska Exportni Banka [Czech Export Bank] 
has been established recently. The state does for our 
entrepreneurs everything possible that is in its power, since 
proexport policy is an inseparable part of its economic policy 
and foreign policy, but the state cannot directly conduct 
business on behalf of enterprises. If it did, then it could 
also draft plans for them, for example. We had this here 
before, but it did not prove to be good. 
  Nevertheless, this does not mean that the state will not 
engage in business in certain specific cases. For instance, if 
the export of large investment units is involved, in which the 
state is interested, the state may help not only politically, 
but also directly -- financially, for example. This is the 
genuine essence of the mechanism of support to foreign trade 
that our government is pushing for. This is precisely the 
proexport regime that we consider to be the most economic.

<F P=106> [Report by Jaroslav Kmenta: "The Experts Reject Neutrality"] </F>
  [Text] Prague -- Army experts believe that the security of 
the state can only be guaranteed by membership in the North 
Atlantic Alliance and by incorporation into the Western European 
Union [WEU]. 
  The analysis conducted by the Institute for International 
Relations -- which will form the basis for the government's 
security policy concept -- absolutely discounts the possibility 
of the republic becoming a neutral country or of it relying 
solely on its own forces and resources for its defense. The 
experts also reject involvement in a defensive system made up 
only of Central European states. 
  The advantage of joining just the WEU is, according to 
diplomats, the possibility of reacting to situations that 
concern only Europe. Despite this, they give priority to 
incorporation into NATO, because it -- as opposed to the WEU -- 
offers a defense system with a functioning military structure. 
  According to the experts, neutrality is no longer 
significant. "Following the cessation of the bipolar world, 
there is no one here to be neutral against," said one of the 
military officials. Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec has 
previously rejected neutrality. He described it as a dangerous 
snare. Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has said the same thing. He 
rejected neutrality as a hollow concept belonging to the realm 
of third ways leading nowhere. 
  It is apparent from the aforementioned document -- for which 
various institutions are now drafting comments -- that the 
republic does not consider anyone to be an enemy a priori and 
that it has no territorial or other political claims against any 
state.

<F P=106> [Report by "TA SR, il": "Giving Finishing Touches to the </F>
Balladur Plan"] 
  [Excerpts] Paris -- A two-day conference on the Stability 
Pact opened in the UNESCO Palace in Paris yesterday. It is 
attended by ministers of foreign affairs from 42 European 
countries, the United States, and Canada. The Slovak Republic 
is represented by Minister of Foreign Affairs Eduard Kukan. 
[passage omitted] 
  In his address, Minister of Foreign Affairs Eduard Kukan 
noted the political readiness of the Slovak Republic to 
contribute to the implementation of the Stability Pact by 
specific steps and by its foreign policy in general. The 
completion of the transformation of the countries of Central and 
Eastern Europe is a longer-term process, which can only take 
place in a peaceful democratic international political 
environment. The Slovak Republic finds this environment in the 
European political, economic, and security structures. He 
stressed that we consider the Stability Pact to be an important 
contribution to European cooperation that supports a further 
improvement in international relations, particularly by 
intensifying and harmonizing cooperation among neighbors. We 
are confident that the Stability Pact project, which we regard 
as one of the means of drawing closer toward European Union 
membership, will contribute to strengthening European security 
and stability.

<F P=106> [Interview with Olga Prascakova, chairwoman of the Slovak </F>
Green Party Preparatory Committee, by Eva Zelenayova; place and 
date not given: "The Greens Lean Toward National Forces"] 
  [Text] [Zelenayova] The Green Party in Slovakia yesterday 
formed a coalition with left-oriented parties. We know that 
this coalition was a reason for a large part of members to leave 
the Green Party. Could this not be avoided? 
  [Prascakova] No. We consider the Party of the Democratic 
Left [SDL] to be the heir of the Communist Party of Slovakia, 
which bears maximum responsibility for the devastation of the 
country and morals. Also, it is inadmissible, for reasons of 
principle, for Greens to enter into a coalition with any 
political party. 
  [Zelenayova] Does that mean that you are preparing the 
registration of a new Green party? Is that desirable? 
  [Prascakova] We have already applied for registration. It 
is common throughout the world for two Green parties to exist 
alongside each other. Usually, they are divided into 
fundamentalists and realists. 
  [Zelenayova] Do you think that you will gain enough members? 
  [Prascakova] Entire district organizations and groups are 
declaring their allegiance to us. Only 14 out of 29 districts 
attended the last meeting of the Coalition Committee where the 
vote on entering a coalition with the SDL was to be taken. 
Apparently, the remaining 15 district organizations were 
opposed to this coalition. 
  [Zelenayova] Will your new Slovak Green Party go into the 
elections on its own? 
  [Prascakova] Originally, we did not want to join forces with 
anyone. But as the party's polarization has already been 
provoked, we will lean toward the nationally oriented parties 
and movements. 
  [Zelenayova] But [SDL Chairman] Peter Weiss has called the 
left-wing coalition a patriotic one. 
  [Prascakova] We are not convinced about that. It is through 
the SDL's fault that the political situation is now under the 
control of parties of the Hungarian ethnic minority. Some 
officials of the Green Party in Slovakia, too, are favorably 
disposed toward the demands formulated in the Komarno appeal 
[issued by representatives of the Hungarian minority on 8 
January 1994]. 
  [Zelenayova] Are you not afraid that Greens will stop taking 
an interest in Green policies? 
  [Prascakova] Not at all. We are actually creating an 
alternative for voters who subscribe to the Green philosophy but 
do not want to vote for the left-wing bloc and [an alternative] 
for that part of our members who want to work for the 
environment but are leaving the party because of its coalition 
with the SDL. We will strive to enlist new members, whereby we 
will increase the number of people who take an interest in the 
Green philosophy.

<F P=106> ["From the appeal" issued by organizers of the Surany </F>
meetings of Slovaks from southern Slovakia and addressed to the 
chairman and deputies of the National Council of the Slovak 
Republic: "We Propose a Referendum!"] 
  [Text] The organizers of the, by now six, Surany meetings 
of Slovaks from southern Slovakia (Eva Garajova, Zdenka 
Anettova, Andrej Strycek, and Stanislav Bajanik) have addressed 
an appeal to the chairman and deputies of the National Council 
of the Slovak Republic [NRSR]. It states: 
  ``The agenda of the 32d NRSR meeting includes two important 
items -- the so-called bill on bilingual signs and the so-called 
bill on [birth and marriage] registers. We draw attention to 
the fact that these laws constitute only another partial 
solution to the entire language problem. Leaving aside the 
initiatives of the Slovak Heritage Foundation, there have been 
six meetings of representatives of Slovaks from southern 
Slovakia at Surany devoted to this issue. At these meetings 
they repeatedly warned that the social, civic, and also 
political situation in southern Slovakia continues to pose a 
permanent threat to the language and ethnic sovereignty of 
Slovaks in their own state. Approximately 500,000 citizens of 
Hungarian nationality, but more than 1.2 million Slovaks, live 
on the territory of southern Slovakia, leaving aside members of 
other nationalities and ethnic groups. Therefore, it would be 
democratic if not only political parties, but all citizens 
living in the region, made decisions on its major problems. We 
recognize the language rights of all our fellow citizens. 
However, we cannot accept rights going beyond the framework of 
established European norms. Their realization in our conditions 
would jeopardize the standing of members of the Slovak nation. 
Moreover, a return to names and designations [of communities] 
from the time of pre-1918 Hungary and from the history of 
Horthyite Hungary is inadmissible. We cannot accept the 
disappearance from the Slovak south of names and designations 
after Slovak national figures. 
  ``Entries in [birth and marriage] registers in the language 
of the minority clash with the codified standard of the state 
language. Interference with this standard is inadmissible in all 
advanced countries. 
  "We appeal to you to postpone the planned partial solutions 
and to deal with the language problem comprehensively, in a 
separate NRSR law on the protection of the state language and in 
a law on the status of ethnic minorities. In those two laws, 
the problem of designating place names should be tackled 
exclusively by means of transcription of the official name into 
the minority language. Should the NRSR fail to accept this 
proposal, we consider it necessary that this sensitive and 
serious problem be dealt with democratically -- by means of a 
referendum." 
  Eva Garajova, Andrej Strycek, and Stanislav Bajanik 
yesterday 
personally visited NRSR Chairman Ivan Gasparovic in this matter.

  [Text] Miklos Duray, chairman of the Coexistence Movement, 
only considers the current form of the European stability 
agreement acceptable if certain national minority interests can 
be included in it. In an interview to the [Bratislava] UJ SZO 
on 25 May, Duray said: "Through its legitimate representatives, 
the Hungarian community wishes to participate in drawing up the 
agreement. We reject all such steps that would exclude our 
direct participation.... There are two alternatives. One is 
that we become part of bilateral talks and, in this case, 
naturally, we accept the mediating role of a third party. As a 
second solution, we consider it more important and necessary to 
create a system of agreements within the given country, in our 
case between the Hungarian minority and the government," Duray 
said.

    [Editorial Report] Bratislava SME in Slovak on 27 May on 
pages 1 and 2 carries a 1,000-word "bog, jam"-signed report on 
the 26 May meeting of the National Council of the Slovak 
Republic [NRSR], most of which was taken up by the debate on a 
no-confidence motion in Milan Janicina, minister for the 
administration and privatization of national property, which had 
been initiated by opposition deputies. According to the SME 
report, "in a secret ballot, NRSR deputies decided not to 
express no-confidence in Minister Milan Janicina. Of the 144 
ballots cast, 139 were valid. A total of 71 deputies voted in 
favor of the vote of no-confidence being passed, 65 deputies 
were against, and 3 abstained. A total of 76 votes would have 
been necessary for the vote of no-confidence to be passed." 
  On the same day, on page 2, Bratislava SME in Slovak carries 
a 400-word interview with Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of 
the Democratic Left [SDL], by Maria Hluchanova entitled "We 
Simply Harmonized Coalition Views." As the interviewer points 
out, the fact that 71 deputies were in favor of Janicina's 
dismissal "raised doubts in the NRSR lobbies about the SDL 
deputies' support for Milan Janicina in the secret ballot." She 
therefore asks Weiss "to confirm or deny conjectures that part 
of the SDL Club of Deputies had voted for Janicina's dismissal." 
  Weiss replies: "All kinds of things can be heard in 
parliamentary lobbies, including that the dismissal was 
supported by a part of Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement, 
Coexistence, and centrist deputies. The voting was secret and 
engaging in speculation is pointless. It has never been 
customary in our Club of Deputies to look one's colleagues over 
the shoulder. The SDL Club of Deputies decided to vote against 
Milan Janicina's dismissal." Weiss emphasizes that "the SDL is 
interested in the coalition working and in all debates about 
privatization being conducted on an expert level and not on an 
ideological level." He also confirms that coalition talks were 
held prior to the vote on Minister Janicina, at which the 
coalition partners "harmonized coalition views" on the issue. 
  Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 27 May on page 2, 
under the headline "Cracks in Coalition?," carries a series of 
brief interviews with representatives of coalition parties, 
totalling 350- words, on their voting on Minister Janicina. The 
interviews are preceded by the following introduction: "The 
outcome of the secret ballot on trust in Minister Milan Janicina 
(National Democratic Party) revealed that some coalition 
deputies had supported the opposition's call for his dismissal. 
In this context, we asked coalition partners whether this 
problem would be taken up by the Coalition Council and whether 
they can rule out that their own deputies had supported the 
no-confidence vote in the minister of privatization." In their 
brief replies, all interviewees voice the conviction that their 
own deputies had not violated the agreement to support Janicina. 
They agree, however, that it would be pointless to raise this 
issue within the framework of the coalition because it is 
impossible to ascertain how individual deputies had actually 
voted.

<F P=106> [Lecture by Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova </F>
delivered at a meeting of the "HOSPODARSKE NOVINY Club" in 
Bratislava on 13 March: "Possibilities of the Slovak Economy"] 
  [Text] The macroeconomic policy of the government until the 
end of 1994 is determined by the goals to achieve zero economic 
growth, a 4-percent state budget deficit, and an inflation rate 
of 10-13 percent, and to keep the rate of unemployment under 17 
percent, to maintain foreign currency reserves, to consolidate 
the internal convertibility of the Slovak koruna, and to 
maintain a balanced balance of payments. Based on an analysis of 
the 1993 results of the economy, the goals for 1994 are 
exceedingly demanding and their attainment is associated with a 
number of risks. Which of these risks are most serious and what 
possibilities do we have to limit or eliminate them? 
<H5>  Risk of Failure To Achieve Zero Economic Growth </H5>
  The factors of this risk are on the side of demand (low 
domestic household demand underpinned by purchasing power, low 
demand of the government and entrepreneurial sector, low 
external demand), but far greater, in my opinion, are the risks 
on the side of supply. They dwell, in particular, in the 
inadequate reaction, differentiated according to sectors, to the 
long-term transformation changes, short-term cyclical changes, 
and other changes in the economic environment. What are the 
causes of the entrepreneurial sector's inadequate reaction? The 
conduct of an entrepreneurial entity depends primarily on the 
internal interest structure and mechanisms of the realization of 
differentiated interests therein, according to the 
characteristics of the entrepreneurial environment [sentence as 
published]. 
  The most radical intervention in the internal interest 
structure is a change in proprietary relations. The structure 
of proprietary relations determines, to a decisive extent, the 
interest structure but the interest structure is also 
influenced, to a large degree, by the mechanisms of the 
realization of interests of various interest groups. Let us 
cite the example of one of the most complex interest structures 
-- the interest structure that comes about in a company that has 
gone through the process of coupon privatization and in which 
the state has retained a certain stake. This structure 
comprises the interests of the management, the interests of 
individual small shareholders, the interests of investment 
funds, the interests of the National Property Fund of the Slovak 
Republic, the interests of employees (those who do not 
constitute the management), the interests of creditors (in the 
event of indebted companies), and, possibly, also the interests 
of an individual large owner (such as a foreign investor, for 
example). The mechanisms of the realization of the interests of 
individual interest groups are still only taking shape and are 
imperfect, as are the mechanisms of solving conflicts between 
diverse interests. Moreover, the existing mechanisms are being 
applied in an environment that deforms their effect. For 
example, the low effectiveness of the law on bankruptcy and 
settlement is not caused only by some of the law's shortcomings. 
The introduction of arbitration proceedings is often being 
criticized. This stipulation is contained also in the U.S. 
bankruptcy law, where, however, it has been introduced in the 
interest of creditors who are insufficiently prepared, or 
afraid, to bear the risks arising from bankruptcy proceedings. 
The risk of the failure to achieve zero economic growth can be 
limited, on the side of supply, by a micro-economic policy of 
the state that will establish suitable conditions for more 
adequate reactions of the entrepreneurial sphere. The main 
focus of the state's micro- economic policy in the 
transformation period is, undoubtedly, a change in proprietary 
relations. However, it must not be confined to that but must 
also center on eliminating various deformations of the 
environment such as, for example, its monopolization, and the 
like. 
  In all the transforming economies, this environment is 
characterized, among other things, by the so-called "trap of 
tough budgetary restrictions." It is a consequence of the 
unfavorable combination of several factors: the rapid transition 
from a soft budget policy toward tough budgetary restrictions, 
companies' inadequate structural adaptation, and soft or 
ineffectual legislative conditions. A result of these factors 
is drastic growth of inter-company credit indebtedness and an 
alarming deterioration of the commercial banks' portfolio. A 
solution to the consequences of the "trap of tough budgetary 
restrictions" will be effective in the long term only when we 
succeed in eliminating its causes. It is therefore exceedingly 
important that various approaches to solving intercompany debts 
and so-called bad debts be coupled with the part of 
transformation policy that establishes conditions for a change 
in the conduct of the entrepreneurial sector. Once these 
prerequisites are met, it will be possible, as the next step, to 
release on a larger scale domestic and foreign credit resources 
so as to boost investment demand. The sooner we succeed in 
setting these processes into motion, the smaller will be the 
risk of failure to achieve zero economic growth. 

<H5>    Risk of Failure To Meet Budget Deficit Target </H5>
  This risk has been fairly thoroughly analyzed and measures 
designed to limit or eliminate it are in an advanced stage of 
preparations. A part of these measures is of fiscal nature 
(tax-related measures, for example), the other part has, in 
addition to fiscal effects, also more fundamental transformation 
effects. The tax-related measures are to raise state budget 
revenues but, on the other hand, they also entail some 
additional risks. There is the risk that the resultant price 
increases will reduce demand and there exist social or political 
risks. The drop in demand could lower the mechanically 
estimated impact of tax adjustments on budget revenues and raise 
demands for additional budget resources. The lowering of social 
risks, for example, could raise demands on additional social 
payments (welfare payments and the like). It is evident that 
the tax adjustments aimed at eliminating the risks of budget 
management must be carried out so that their positive effects 
outweigh their potential negative effects. 
  Measures that, in addition to fiscal effects, have 
transformation effects, too, include the lowering of subsidies 
of the prices of electricity, gas, and heat for households. 
Maintaining these prices deep below the level of costs does not 
encourage energy conservation and, at the same time, it deforms 
criteria for the allocation of investments in individual sectors 
of the economy. The liberalization of the prices of energy for 
households is therefore an important transformation step. 
  On the other hand, it requires that: 
  a) steps be taken to prevent monopoly price rises (by 
introducing regulation of natural monopolies), 
  b) steps be taken to limit the impact on households in 
general (by promoting energy conservation programs) and on 
socially weak groups in particular (by means of various schemes 
of protecting the socially weakest strata). 
<H5>  Sociopolitical Risks </H5>
  The fifth consecutive year of economic decline, and the 
resulting continuing decline of employment, growth of the cost 
of living, growth in the number of long-term unemployed, growing 
number of households whose income is in the range of 1 to 1.5 
times the subsistence minimum, and so forth, poses the growing 
risk that transformation will become socially unsustainable. 
The fact that these processes are in their fifth consecutive 
year (with a certain alleviation in the second half of 1992) is 
particularly serious. It means that the mitigating effect of 
the relatively good starting social standard of households in 
1989 is being exhausted. Major risks dwell in: 
  a) the growth of the socially weaker strata at the expense 
of 
the middle class, 
  b) the growing regional differentiation of the social 
situation, 
  c) the impossibility of tackling some needs of the 
population 
(such as housing needs) from their own resources, in a situation 
when other resources not available. 
  The mounting social difficulties create a fertile soil for 
political forces proposing extreme or populist solutions. The 
enforcement of such solutions in the actual economic sphere 
would, however, further aggravate the risks of the Slovak 
economy. 
  There is no doubt that alleviating the risks in the economic 
sphere -- that is, in particular, the risk of failure to achieve 
zero economic growth, the risk of higher-than-projected 
inflation, and so forth -- is the basic prerequisite for 
addressing the sociopolitical risks. On the other hand, it will 
also be necessary to take steps in the social sphere that will 
alleviate social tension and maintain social peace. Without 
maintaining social peace, it is impossible to create by 
democratic means prerequisites for the Slovak economy to become, 
within an acceptable time frame, a modern and efficient economy 
integrated into the European and global economic structures. 
  The endeavor to maintain social peace makes it necessary to 
spread the social costs of transformation over a longer period 
of time. This means that some partial transformation measures 
with serious social repercussions must be administered in doses, 
without, however, being postponed. It is becoming apparent 
that, without administration in doses, as it were, costs of the 
social safety net can soar and trigger additional risks (for 
example, sharply increase the budget risk). A hopeless 
situation then comes about. 
  The estimates of the costs of transformation are often being 
compared with the costs of reconstructing the war-ravaged West 
European economy [after 1945]. The transforming states cannot 
reckon with any new Marshall Plan. Foreign aid represents only 
a small fraction of their needs. The magnitude of the costs, 
and the social inevitability of spreading them over a period of 
time, make it necessary to acquire foreign credit resources. It 
is of extraordinary importance under what terms these resources 
are extended and on what they are spent. 
  It is the duty of government policy to ensure that the terms 
under which resources are acquired, and the methods of their 
use, be as favorable as possible for the Slovak economy. 
  That is why it will be necessary, in the course of 1994, to 
address the risks of the Slovak economy and to demand the 
implementation of an economic policy, the aims of which are not 
easy to reconcile: maintaining macroeconomic stability at an 
adequate level and ensuring that the economic decline does not 
continue. The conditions in which the Slovak economy finds 
itself in the year 1994 make this task even more demanding.

  [Text] Prime Minister Dr. Janez Drnovsek said for our 
radio and television station that he had accepted the 
resignation offered by Interior Minister Ivo Bizjak. In reply 
to a question by Bojan Veselinovic, Drnovsek said that if it 
were not for the well-known Klagenfurt incident, Bizjak still 
would have been minister. Dr. Janez Drnovsek also said: 
  [Begin recording] [Drnovsek] I have decided to accept the 
resignation of Minister Bizjak. I believe that by offering his 
resignation Minister Bizjak has acted in a principled and 
correct manner and that I must act likewise and accept his 
resignation. I believe that this will facilitate and safeguard 
consolidation within the Interior Ministry. 
  [Veselinovic] Would you have decided to replace Minister 
Bizjak even if the Klagenfurt incident had not happened? 
  [Drnovsek] I believe that the direct reason for this 
replacement is the Klagenfurt incident, that this is a question 
of objective responsibility just as was the case with [former 
Defense] Minister Jansa. [end recording] 
  [Veselinovic] When asked whether he had proposed to Minister 
Bizjak that he replace Vinko Beznik, head of the special police 
troops, and Mitja Klavora, head of the Crime Department, even 
before the Klagenfurt robbery, Drnovsek replied: not directly, 
even though he had proposed, on the basis of the debate over the 
government report on the Depala Vas incident, that Bizjak take 
adequate measures within the ministry, including personnel 
measures. 
  [Begin recording] [Veselinovic] Therefore, if the personnel 
changes had been carried out and there had been no Klagenfurt 
incident, hypothetically speaking Ivo Bizjak would have still 
been the interior minister? 
  [Drnovsek] That is so. [end recording] 
  [Veselinovic] In the next few days Drnovsek will send a 
proposal for the new interior minister to the State Chamber, 
which will merely be informed of the acceptance of Bizjak's 
resignation. Drnovsek did not comment on the names of the two 
candidates known for far, for new interior minister. He only 
said that he will decide in the next few days when, in 
accordance with the coalition agreement, the Christian Democrats 
will propose a candidate who will also have to be acceptable for 
him as the prime minister. [end recording]

  [Text] Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek in an interview for 
REUTERS explained the government views about a recent 
Slovene-Italian conflict. He gave his assurance that our 
country intends to persist in its views regarding its heritage 
from World War II and expressed belief that the European Union 
will support us in this. He warned that, if Italy continues to 
exert pressure upon our country in the future, Slovenia will 
demand compensation for the time of occupation by Fascist Italy 
and protection for approximately 100,000 Slovenes in Italy. He 
did not ascribe any major significance to a recent Italian move, 
when at the Conference on Stability in Europe Slovenia was cut 
from the list of countries that are potential EU members at the 
insistence of the Rome authorities.

  [Text] As is known, President Milan Kucan is scheduled to 
depart for a visit to Zagreb at the beginning of next week. It 
is supposed to be an unofficial visit even though Croatia has 
tried, with the statements of its ambassador in Ljubljana, 
Miljenko Zagar, to portray it as official talks between 
Presidents Kucan and Tudjman. 
  We have learned unofficially that in a letter to Prime 
Minister Dr. Janez Drnovsek President Kucan warned that it would 
be good if all offices responsible for Slovene foreign policy 
were to reexamine the purpose of his visit to Zagreb together 
with the government. In mid-May, after President Kucan received 
the invitation from Zagreb, the Slovene foreign minister was 
still in favor of the visit. However, since then circumstances 
have changed. In the letter to Drnovsek, Kucan warned that 
since October 1992, when he and Croatian President Tudjman last 
met, there have been no meetings at presidential level. Despite 
this, the question arises as to what the scope of Kucan's visit 
to Zagreb could be, since the latest events have shown a lack of 
any sign of mutual desire to resolve outstanding problems 
between the two countries through consensus. 
  In his letter, Kucan cited the example of Secovlje and the 
construction of a border crossing there in spite of the protest 
by Prime Minister Drnovsek to Croatian Prime Minister Valentic. 
A decision about the visit will be known in the next few days 
when the government's official position becomes known. 
  President Kucan and Prime Minister Drnovsek discussed this 
subject this afternoon.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 31 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslavia will this 
week submit a request to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
once again to extend the deadline for the regulation of 
Yugoslavia's status with the IMF until mid-December, Zarko 
Trbojevic, chief advisor to the governor of the National Bank of 
Yugoslavia, told TANJUG on Tuesday [31 May]. The deadline was 
extended last December until June 14, 1994. Trbojevic said that 
an IMF Board of Directors decision of December 14, 1992, said 
that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has ceased to 
exist and is thus no longer an IMF member. He said this was the 
first such decision of the board ever to occur since the 
founding of the IMF. 
  Under the IMF decision, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's 
share in the succession of the former Yugoslavia's assets and 
liabilities with the fund amounts to 36.52 per cent. All former 
Yugoslavia's successors were given one month (expiring on 
January 14, 1993) officially to agree or disagree with their 
respective shares in former Yugoslavia's assets and liabilities 
in the IMF. 
  Yugoslavia notified the IMF that it accepts its share, 
bearing in mind that this amount could not be permanent because 
the share of each IMF member-country should reflect its real 
economic power. The IMF said that Yugoslavia's status would be 
regulated if Yugoslavia settled its share of outstanding debts, 
passed a law on accepting obligations ensuing from the IMF 
Constitution, and if the IMF gave a positive assessment of 
Yugoslavia's liability to fullfil its obligations under the U.N. 
sanctions. All things considered, Yugoslavia has urged the IMF 
Board of Directors to extend the deadline for meeting these 
conditions, which the IMF did both in June and December 1993. 
  The Yugoslav Government has said that its top priority task 
is to maintain and reactivate its cooperation with the IMF and 
the World Bank.

  [Text] Tivat, Yugoslavia, May 31 (TANJUG) -- The Yugoslav 
naval command has prepared and performed a several-day tactical 
exercise with the use of live ammunition, the information 
service of the Yugoslav Army General Staff said on Tuesday [31 
May]. The exercise was carried out within the realisation of 
the tasks of this year's combat training aimed at checking the 
combat and operational-tactical readiness and degree of training 
of the Yugoslav naval command and its units in the defence of 
the Yugoslav part of the Adriatic coast. Tested were the 
organisation and performance of the anti-combat defence of the 
Yugoslav part of the coast in case of an aggression on 
Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro), with the support of the military 
air force and anti-aircraft defence, it was said. 
  Acccording to its contents and dynamism, the exercise 
represents one of the most complex forms of testing the degree 
of combat readiness of navy units for fighting targets at sea, 
land or in the air. At the end of the exercise, the navy 
performed shooting exercises with torpedoes, artillery and 
anti-submarine ammunition. The final part of the exercise was 
watched by the Yugoslav president and the president of the 
Supreme Defence Council, Zoran Lilic, Montenegrin President and 
member of the Supreme Defence Council, Momir Bulatovic, the 
Yugoslav Army chief of general staff, Colonel General Momcilo 
Perisic and the commanders of the Yugoslav army strategic 
groups. Lilic, Bulatovic and Gen. Perisic agreed that the 
degree of training of the fleet and coastal defence was high, as 
well as their readiness to successfully deal with all kinds of 
threats to Yugoslavia's territorial integrity and sovereignty.

<F P=106> [Report by Snezana Rodic; Churkin speaks in English with </F>
superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation -- recorded] 
  [Text] Shortly before his departure from Belgrade, Vitaliy 
Churkin was once again received by Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic. The talks were attended by Milan Martic, president 
of the republic of Serbian Krajina, and Borislav Mikelic, prime 
minister of the republic of Serbian Krajina. Churkin also met 
delegations of the republic of Serbian Krajina and the republic 
of Srpska today. Here is a report by Snezana Rodic on how 
today's talks were held and how they were assessed: 
  [Rodic] How would you briefly assess the second round of 
talks with President Milosevic? 
  [Churkin] We were summarizing the overall talks we held 
today and I think that the Serbian side is serious and that it 
is seriously going to attend the Geneva meeting with a view to 
agreeing on the cessation of hostilities. They are preparing 
themselves for the second round of negotiations with the contact 
group. This will take place soon. I think that all this was 
worthwhile. We in Moscow are planning a very busy month of June 
as regards the matters that will have to be done urgently. 
  [Rodic] Did you talk about sanctions with President 
Milosevic? 
  [Churkin] If I had not mentioned them, he would have 
mentioned them to me. This issue is usually mentioned at our 
talks. 
  [Rodic] (?Would) you say something more about that? 
  [Churkin] We have this position that I think is a very good 
one. It is included in the ministerial communique. Therefore, a 
solution to the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina will lead to the 
suspension of sanctions. I think that this is an encouragement 
to the Serbian side to reach a solution. 
  [Rodic] In the Russian Embassy in Belgrade, Vitaliy Churkin 
first met a delegation of the Republic of Serbian Krajina which 
included Milan Martic and Borislav Mikelic. They discussed the 
continuation of negotiations with Croatia. It was pointed out 
that the Republic of Serbian Krajina is an equal partner and 
that it has respected the peace agreement on cease-fire, 
something which was also confirmed by UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces]. The main problem is where the peace negotiations are 
to be held. 
  [Martic] Our stand is that this should be a neutral venue, 
outside the territory of either Croatia or Krajina, although 
Croatia insisted that the venue be exclusively in Croatia or 
Krajina, thereby prejudging the political solution that Krajina 
is within Croatia and wanting somehow to reduce this to its 
internal problem. We are still insisting that this should be a 
neutral place. It can be a Russian embassy in any foreign 
country. However, we still remain open for negotiations, but of 
course should hold consultations within our ranks, that is, in 
the parliament and the government. 
  [Rodic] Churkin then had talks with a delegation of the 
Serbian Republic, Dr. Nikola Koljevic and Momcilo Krajisnik. 
This was a consultative talk on the eve of the Geneva 
negotiations that have been convened by Yasushi Akashi. The 
Serbian side pointed out that a new Croatian-Muslim federation 
must not turn into an anti-Serb coalition. 
  [Krajisnik] (?I) informed Mr. Churkin that our negotiating 
team will go to the meeting to conclude an agreement on the 
cessation of hostilities and that we are going to take part in 
the next meeting of the contact group. 
  We have also discussed certain (?disputable) issues. Maps 
are always (?disputable) issues. There has been no special 
progress. Muslim proposals presented to us are already known. 
This is east Bosnia, western Bosnia, they are all questions 
demanding great attention and effort in order to reach the final 
solution. 
  [Koljevic in English with superimposed translation into 
Serbo-Croatian] We think that the cessation of hostilities is 
by far the most important thing. We are prepared to discuss 
territories. We do not think that percentages are a good 
approach to the beginning, but we are ready to discuss 
territories, albeit with arguments about the maps -- quality, 
infrastructure, communications are much more important things 
than percentages. 
  [Churkin] I am encouraged that my talks with Mr. Martic were 
very useful. I think that everything is moving forward, toward 
the beginning of the talks about economic matters, so I expect 
that before too long we shall find a way to begin these talks 
about economic normalization between Knin and Zagreb, that is, 
about the second stage of their difficult road toward a 
normalization of relations. I also had useful talks with Mr. 
Krajisnik and Mr. Koljevic. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Koljevic told us half an 
hour ago that one should talk about the quality of territories. 
Would one have to redefine the 49-51 percent relation? 
  [Churkin] No, that will stay. They have to talk about these 
details within the framework of the concept approved by foreign 
ministers of the key countries. This was not a frivolous 
decision, but one based on the months of very long discussions 
and talks between all sides. They will have to stick to that 
concept.

  [Text] Podgorica, May 31 (TANJUG) -- It has been officially 
estimated that the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro has sustained 
a loss of over five billion dollars over the past two years of 
the international blockade. Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo 
Djukanovic has said that this is the rough estimate of both 
direct and indirect losses caused by the sanctions. He added, 
however, that there were also losses which cannot be measured by 
statistical figures. 
  According to the federal government, the international 
blockade has over the past two years inflicted on the Yugoslav 
economy a direct loss of 35 billion dollars, which, together 
with those caused indirectly, amount to 100 billion dollars. On 
May 30, 1992, the U.N. Security Council introduced draconic 
economic sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
(Serbia/Montenegro) because of its alleged involvement in the 
civil war among Moslems, Serbs and Croats in neighbouring 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Most Montenegrin firms are operating at 
intervals and below their rated capacities. It is estimated 
that one-third of the total 130,000-strong workforce has been 
laid off with token pay due to the slashed production rate. 
  Montenegro's most vital and profitable industries, such as 
tourism, maritime economy, iron and steel industry and 
non-ferrous metal industry, have been severely crippled by the 
international blockade. Montenegro's fleet, which formerly 
accounted for about 20 per cent of the annual foreign currency 
revenues and for about five per cent of the total revenues, has 
found itself on the verge of collapse. The fleet's 37 ships, 
with 977,000-tonne cargo capacity, is blocked in harbours 
throughout the world, for which Yugoslavia has to pay a lay-over 
tax amounting to over 50 million dollars a year. 
  The sanctions have especially aggravated the humanitarian 
situation in the republic, as the impoverished economy bears the 
brunt of providing not only for its 615,000 citizens but also 
for more than 50,000 refugees in Montenegro. Over the past two 
years, Montenegro has on several occasions urged the U.N. 
Sanctions Committee to approve exports of alumina, which would 
enable the purchase of necessary foodstuffs and medicines, but 
none of the requests have so far been approved.

<F P=106> ["B.A.P."-signed interview with Ivan Peto, chairman of the </F>
Alliance of Free Democrats; place and date not given: "Eternal 
Second?"] 
  [Text] The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] cannot 
initiate coalition steps, and no signal has yet arrived from the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Peto told 
us when we asked him about his party's election results and 
coalition possibilities. 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] The SZDSZ finished in second place in both 
free elections so far. In the last issue of MAGYAR NARANCS 
[HUNGARIAN ORANGE], socialist political scientist Mihaly Bihari 
drew the conclusion that no liberal party can win in Hungary. 
Is there any truth in this? 
  [Peto] I could refute this if the SZDSZ won the elections, 
but I think this was not the first mistake of Mihaly Bihari. It 
is not fortunate to come up with such an eternal judgment that a 
party always finishes second, because it generally does not 
happen so. 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] Some people assume that the SZDSZ is 
hesitating to form a coalition because this way an 
MSZP-Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] government alliance could 
emerge and these two parties will soon lose value and then the 
SZDSZ will remain the only marketable political force. 
  [Peto] I have not yet heard about this assumption. On such 
a basis, one could also consider the possibility of an MSZP- 
Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP] coalition. 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] on the eve of the elections, [trade union 
chief] Sandor Nagy said that his party thinks in terms of a 
coalition anyway. If the SZDSZ is not willing to form such a 
coalition, they will form an alliance with another party. 
  [Peto] Apart from the SZDSZ and the MSZP, there are still 
four other parliamentary parties. They can also think of the 
Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], the Christian Democratic 
People's Party [KDNP], and the FKGP. I do not want to deal with 
every possibility separately. 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] In view of the election results, the first 
half of the runners ends with the MDF. The other three parties 
are lagging far behind the front runners. 
  [Peto] The MSZP does not need to form an alliance with a big 
party; they can form a coalition with any small party if any of 
these parties is willing. 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] The head of the MSZP list already declared 
that they are thinking in terms of a coalition anyway. However, 
there is not yet a relevant answer from the head of the SZDSZ 
list. 
  [Peto] I said to this that if a party does not have a 
parliamentary majority, we consider it to be necessary; if it 
has a parliamentary majority, we consider it to be possible. I 
have nothing to say in addition to this. There is not yet any 
coalition offer whatsoever at the moment; only the intention for 
a coalition has been declared so far. No one called upon us 
with a coalition offer. We cannot initiate anything with our 
17-18 percent. 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] Peter Hack said in one of the dailies that he 
would not take the SZDSZ into a coalition in this political 
situation. 
  [Peto] He was correct in declaring this. 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] Does that mean that Ivan Peto also thinks so? 
  [Peto] As the SZDSZ chairman, I think that I should not 
treat the public with my own private opinions. Of course, I 
have my own private opinion, but the party should form its 
opinion. I said that in the case of an absolute majority, the 
chances of a coalition are much smaller -- at least on our part 
-- than in case there were not such an absolute majority. 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] However, you did not exclude the possibility 
of a government coalition with the MSZP. 
  [Peto] Nor did Peter Hack. He said that, on his part, he 
would not support such a proposal.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky by Pal </F>
Lederer and Gyula L. Ortutay; place and date not given: "I Am 
One of the Star Witnesses"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [NEPSZABADSAG] Rumors spread 
months ago about a closed meeting in which you said that, 
regardless of the election results, the Foreign Ministry will 
essentially remain in the hands of the Hungarian Democratic 
Forum [MDF]. Do you confirm these rumors? If so, on what did 
you base your opinion then? 
  [Jeszenszky] This happened about six to nine months ago, and 
it was hardly a secret, because NEPSZABADSAG also mentioned it 
after a few days. I said then that no one should think that the 
future election results were clear and the MDF can be discarded. 
I am still convinced that, six months ago, no one could 
responsibly predict the present results. I counted on a more 
balanced result at the elections, with good chances for the MDF 
also to retain the Foreign Ministry. Naturally, this no longer 
seems probable. My prediction was that, with a few percent 
difference, the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], the Alliance 
of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], the Federation of Young Democrats 
[Fidesz], and the MDF would largely fare equally. If this had 
actually taken place, the MDF would have been justified in 
demanding the Foreign Ministry because foreign policy has been 
one of the strong points of the party, thanks to Jozsef Antall's 
strategic thinking and to the activity carried out here. 
[passage omitted] 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] According to recent news, at the request of 
the Czech Government, the Institute of International Relations 
in Prague prepared a report on potential dangers and included 
here its concepts regarding Greater Hungary. 
  [Jeszenszky] And Greater Germany too.... 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] Was this report timed for the Balladur 
conference in Paris? 
  [Jeszenszky] I cannot tell whether the timing was accidental 
or deliberate. I have not yet heard about this institute. As 
for the aforementioned formulation, it is rather propagandistic; 
so far, we have only been able to hear about Greater Hungary 
programs from Romania. This term is not even used in Hungary; 
in professional circles, we use mostly the term "historical." I 
do not think that one can find a program from recent years which 
includes the creation of Greater Hungary. My answer to this is 
that Greater Europe is the goal in Hungary's program. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] In your opinion, has the Hungarian Foreign 
Ministry done everything in its power to reduce the lack of 
confidence prevailing in the neighboring countries? 
  [Jeszenszky] One can always find faults. Obviously, it is 
impossible to fulfill every expectation. At the same time, I 
have a good conscience about the last five years of the foreign 
policy thinking of the present Hungarian Government. I know 
what we said and what we did. We are talking about a consistent 
line. Today, I regard the same things as necessary as in 1989. 
I know that opinions have been voiced lately, particularly in 
the election campaign, according to which the Hungarian 
Government has contributed to this lack of confidence with its 
statements and other things. I think one could not have done 
more for building confidence. As early as at the beginning of 
my office, I wanted to visit these countries, and I managed to 
call on Belgrade, Zagreb, Prague, Bratislava, and naturally 
Vienna in the first ten weeks. My visit to Bucharest would also 
have taken place much earlier, if some events in the Romanian 
Parliament had not occurred. 
  Irrespective of my meetings, the rapprochement of nations 
along the Danube has always been my great desire. We signed 
basic treaties with three states where the situation of ethnic 
Hungarians has been settled through parliamentary legislation, 
namely with Ukraine, Croatia, and Slovenia. The 
Slovenian-Hungarian agreement on minority rights is an example, 
and we are ready to sign such an agreement with any of our 
neighbors, and this would be a good incentive for the basic 
treaty. We have offered this to all our neighbors. These are 
the facts; the rest is only interpretation. [passage omitted] 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] What do you regard as your major personal 
failure and success in your position as foreign minister? 
  [Jeszenszky] I am sorry that we did not succeed in creating 
harmonious relations with all our neighbors, but I do not have 
to regard this as my personal failure, because this did not 
depend on my personal attitude or on that of the government. I 
am dissatisfied with our contacts with the society, and this 
equally refers to foreign policy and the government in general. 
For example, in 1992, I had the opportunity to speak in detail 
about Hungary's foreign policy problems and the foreign policy 
issues of this area on Japanese television. There are very few 
programs in the Hungarian Television in which one can explain in 
detail what is happening in foreign politics. As for our 
successes, I would mention the peace partnership with NATO and 
the fact that Hungarian diplomacy did a lot for the content of 
this partnership to improve compared with the original ideas. I 
find it extremely important that we signed treaties with 
Gorbachev, Yeltsin, and Kravchuk on the same day on 6 December 
1991, and with the EC ten days later. These are mostly results 
of common thoughts and common action, but Hungarian diplomacy 
played a considerable role in making many people and many 
countries have a good impression about Hungary. We succeeded in 
bringing a lot of excellent people into the Hungarian diplomacy, 
and we succeeded in developing a ministry that functions well. 
Perhaps this is what I regard as our major achievement.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sandor Nagy, chairman of the National </F>
Federation of Trade Unions in Hungary, by Peter Csala; place and 
date not given: "Sandor Nagy Has No Ministerial Ambitions"] 
  [Text] Setting the electronic points at Celldomolk was 
only a small action for Sandor Nagy, chairman of the National 
Federation of Trade Unions in Hungary [MSZOSZ]. Nagy met 
railway workers during his visit to Vas County. It remains a 
big question for him, too, whether it will be just as easy for 
him in his capacity of parliamentary deputy of the governing 
party to put the engine of trade unions on its tracks. We asked 
him about his views on the future of the trade unions that will 
become a parliamentary factor after the elections. 
  [Nagy] The role of the trade unions will definitely change 
in the coming four years. If for no other reason then because 
the current government is trying to keep the MSZOSZ in 
quarantine, with the occasional support of the liberal 
opposition. Our struggle against this often distracted us from 
our essential duties. Our proposals were rejected and the 
government treated us as enemies. We will not have to face this 
when the government is led by the Hungarian Socialist Party 
[MSZP]. I expect that we will be seen as important partners. 
  [Csala] In order to be seen as partners, do the trade unions 
definitely have to sit in Parliament, as deputies of precisely 
the governing party? 
  [Nagy] I do not think that this issue is as important as is 
presented by the press nowadays. The deputies will indeed have 
to decide about their attitude. When the MSZP made the 
agreement with us, it could not have wanted us to deny our 
identity and it did not. Therefore, naturally, we will also 
represent the interests of employees in Parliament and we will 
not basically change our views. It is important that we take the 
requests and demands of employees into Parliament instead of 
explaining and mediating the government's measures to our 
members. This is not what they expect from us. 
  [Csala] How can this be made consistent with the discipline 
in the parliamentary group? 
  [Nagy] I cannot say anything about this at the moment 
because I do not know what discipline in the parliamentary group 
will mean for the MSZP. We will probably have conflicts but we 
would like these to remain manageable and possible to solve. 
  [Csala] At the moment, you are chairman of the MSZOSZ, 
leader of the local social insurance administration board for 
pensions, and future parliamentary deputy. Are these not too 
much together? 
  [Magy] The law prescribes that I have to resign my position 
at the social insurance administration board within 30 days 
after receiving my mandate. I will do this. However, in my 
view, the chairmanship of the trade unions does not clash with 
being a parliamentary deputy. There are other examples of this 
in Europe. 
  [Csala] Would you perhaps accept a governmental function or 
a ministerial position? 
  [Nagy] I did not think of this even when I decided to run in 
the elections. As a matter of fact, one does not have to be a 
parliamentary deputy to become a government member. At the 
moment, I do not have such ambitions. 
  [Csala] What possibilities can you see to solve the problems 
of social insurance? 
  [Nagy] Short and long-term proposals will have to be drawn 
up in both areas. However, it is important for the two systems 
of social insurance to be completely separated both 
organizationally and financially by the end of the year. Health 
insurance is impossible to finance in its current form and, 
because of the links, it is a burden on the pension insurance 
system. Together, the two insurance funds struggle with a 150 
billion forints deficit, therefore, we have to begin to collect 
the debts owed to us as soon as possible and to have the state 
assets handed over to the insurance boards immediately. 
  [Csala] What are your views on the coalition possibilities? 
What would be the attitude of the MSZOSZ in case of a balanced 
coalition between the MSZP and the Alliance of Free Democrats? 
  [Nagy] I believe that a coalition led by a strong MSZP will 
emerge. It would lead to many senseless conflicts between the 
government and the trade unions if the liberal economic program 
was implemented. I trust that this will not happen and this is 
why I ask everyone to go to vote on Sunday [29 May] and not to 
let themselves be influenced in their decision.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "The Horn Government Is Coming"] </F>
  [Text] The Socialists have won a landslide victory that 
exceeds all expectations and, as a whole, they obtained more 
than half of the parliamentary mandates. The trend of the first 
round of elections continued and even became stronger in the 
second round: Down with the ruling coalition parties and no to 
the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] too; one should vote 
for the Socialists, or for the Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ]! The only question now is whether the new government 
will be a one-pattern one, or are there parties that will accept 
the Socialists' coalition offer. If the SZDSZ, which came in 
second with 20 percent of the mandates, accepts the role of 
coalition partner even with such a percentage, the new 
government will have a majority of more than 70 percent in 
parliament. This means that this government will have a free 
hand in governing and, in the sense of the constitutional law, 
it can do whatever it wants. The weightless opposition will 
actually have nothing to say in managing Hungary's affairs. If 
the SZDSZ does not accept the coalition, most probably the Horn 
government will have an unstable parliamentary majority but, 
compared with the previous parliamentary cycle, this government 
will face a much more divided opposition. 
  The MSZP election victory is the success of the policy the 
party has conducted in the past four years and in the election 
campaign, as well as the consequence of the voters' deep 
disappointment in the government led by the Hungarian Democratic 
Forum [MDF]. The Socialists succeeded in convincing one-third 
of the voters that the MSZP not only represents a real 
alternative to the conservative forces, but it is also able to 
replace them. The Socialists' message was clear: They accept 
government responsibility, they endeavor to come to an agreement 
rather than confrontation, they have a modernization plan that 
can be implemented, and they represent a real governing force 
with their professionalism and political experience. Their 
electoral alliance with the largest trade union bloc, namely the 
National Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions [MSZOSZ], also 
brought them many votes. In addition, with Gyula Horn, the MSZP 
presented a front man who was facing the often base attacks 
directed at him while increasing the popularity of his party and 
of himself (and probably his car accident also played a role in 
this), and this also attracted many hesitant voters to the 
Socialists. One can predict with certainty that, having the 
majority in parliament, the MSZP congress will nominate Gyula 
Horn for the position of prime minister and will probably make a 
coalition offer to the SZDSZ. The MSZP is aware of the fact 
that the number of its parliamentary mandates is considerably 
larger than the social representation of one-third of Hungary's 
voters who supported the party, and inviting the SZDSZ into a 
coalition might effectively increase the political and mass 
support of the government; and there is urgent need for this, 
given Hungary's current situation. 
  However, this will put the SZDSZ in a serious dilemma. 
Although the SZDSZ fared well in the campaign finish, it failed 
to repeat its previous result of 91 mandates in 1990. The 
rhetoric it used in the period between the two rounds of the 
present elections did not seem to work, namely that people 
should vote for the SZDSZ because this is the only party capable 
of counterbalancing the numerical superiority of the MSZP within 
the government and it is the only party whose candidate for the 
position of prime minister, namely Gabor Kuncze, could represent 
an alternative to Gyula Horn. The SZDSZ has to decide: It will 
either become a fifth wheel on the socialists' cart or it will 
get into opposition and will try to exercise pressure from 
outside. It is worth pondering about what erodes the party and 
its support more: accepting government responsibility from a 
relatively weak position or remaining outside. However, it is 
also questionable whether the SZDSZ is able to bear another four 
years of opposition and whether it can be regarded as a 
governing force at all. 
  Whatever the outcome -- either a one-pattern government or a 
coalition -- the winners will not have time to celebrate.

<F P=106> [Article by Istvan Schlett: "Migrating Voters -- Who </F>
Decided and on What?"] 
  [Text] As I write this article, it cannot yet be known 
what the results of the coalition talks between the Hungarian 
Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ] will be -- we might have to wait days for this. 
However, it is certain that a government change will take 
place: The hitherto determining government party will go into 
opposition and the MSZP, which has so far been in opposition 
will come to government -- alone or with a coalition partner. 
  "What happened here?" Analysts and politicians are asking 
this and will be doing so for a long time. Although -- 
presumably -- the majority of society is more interested in the 
question "what will happen," it is not at all insignificant to 
give a correct answer to the first question. The practical 
answer to the second question depends to a large extent on 
whether the politicians -- winners and losers alike -- draw the 
right conclusions from the final results of the elections. 
  In my view, it is a big mistake to say that the "people" -- 
although it is probably more precise to say that the majority of 
electors -- made its decision in an ideological war, namely that 
it chose the left wing or socialism, perhaps liberalism, as 
opposed to the right wing, the national group, conservatism, or 
Christianity. At most, half of the electors can be characterized 
by these ideological definitions. With suitable generosity, the 
30 percent who voted for the losers can be listed among these, 
and some 10 percent each from the camps of the winners, people 
who supported their parties even in bad times. 
  However, the change of government was decided by the other 
50 
percent. They decided it in such a way that they did not 
concurrently become socialists or left-wing liberals, rather, 
they had simply had enough of the failures -- or what was seen 
as such -- of the government, the deteriorating living standards 
-- or what was perceived as such -- and politicians spending 
their time on debates that are uninteresting for them. These 
citizens were not interested in either rational or emotional 
explanations: reference to the "forty years" or the past in the 
reprisal forces, the national or the Christian slogans. 
  Is this due to the people being wise, as it is said by those 
who, even months ago, scared people with the right-wing 
extremists' coming to power, assuming that it is possible to 
deceive them with national demagogy, anti-Semitism, and other 
wild ideas. Or is it because they are stupid, stupefied, and 
can be misled, as is resentfully believed by some of the current 
losers who used to be talk loudly about the people's wisdom. 
  I very much doubt that the "people" are able to change their 
character and abilities so quickly. Something else must be the 
reason. 
  I suspect practical considerations behind the decision. The 
past four years have not met their expectations. However, if I 
think about the results of public opinion polls, I can also say 
that at least one side of their decision was made in the few 
months following the change of the regime. However, at that 
time -- let us remember -- their wishes were projected into the 
Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]. It is a different 
matter why this party did not manage to keep its sympathizers 
and why they have moved on, searching for an alternative to the 
government -- it is the Fidesz that will first have to find the 
answer to this. 
  What is important for me now is that about half of the 
electors did not choose between the alternative world views or 
the political alternatives, they did not join any political 
camps. Whether this is wise or stupid behavior, it should be 
discussed by the politicians and intellectuals divided according 
to trends -- or I could say, the camps. However, politicians -- 
if they wish to be successful -- have to face facts whether they 
are winners or losers. The reason is that it is not certain that 
the migration has ended: It is possible that it will very soon 
-- perhaps again within months -- be restarted. 
  This is the nature of practical decisions linked to 
situations. Precisely because ideological or value affiliations 
play little role in these decisions, they are not linked to 
traditions and not even to personal trust in the leaders chosen 
by the people themselves. The correctness of the decision is 
measured by the results: If they do not prove forthcoming then 
the decision can be changed without hesitation. 
  Therefore, it would be a mistake to believe that the 
electors 
have finally or at least lastingly found their places in the 
political camps. In this sense, the process of the development 
of party affiliations has not ended. Therefore, the most we can 
say is that the parties that see themselves on the left have won 
because the electors voted on them, but it would be very risky 
to say that these electors are on the left. It is not at all 
certain that the future governmental activities determined by 
the goals and scope of the winning party (or parties) coincide 
with the desires of the "migrating voters," and if they do not, 
whether this party (or parties) can bind these people to 
themselves. It is possible -- in fact, likely -- that even if 
these people do place themselves on the right to left or 
socialist-liberal to conservative scale, or on any ideological 
or world view scale, then this is not identical with the notions 
the parties themselves have. 
  Naturally, we have no reason to assume that the process of 
developing party affiliations will not progress -- after all, 
about half of the electors have managed to find their places in 
four years and they are indeed linked to various parties on the 
basis of interests, sentiments, trust, and even values, and not 
only promises. It would be more difficult for them to change 
their affiliations, the spectacular success or failure of their 
parties would be needed for their "enlightenment" on the road to 
Damascus. Their number might even increase. However, it is 
difficult to imagine that ideological motives would be needed 
for the majority of the very practically thinking 50 percent to 
do this. Another version seems to be more credible: If 
experience justifies their choice, then confidence is formed, 
and binding to the party, its value system, and ideology also 
emerge. And then traditions, political families, and stable 
voting camps are also formed. 
  If I am correct then this has only happened to a certain 
extent up to now. The new government and the politicians who 
come to power will have to be aware of this. What kind of 
decisions they make in the knowledge of this is precisely where 
their great responsibility lies. Decisions whose single aim is 
to keep the mass support -- which might cost the country dearly 
-- or decisions that are demanded by the country's best interest 
according to the circumstances, their best abilities, and 
conscience. Now, to be consciously naive, I add that the 
opposition also has a responsibility. It might happen in such a 
way that it would be very easy to take revenge. However, they 
will have to assess the value and cost of things. 
  I do not believe that a new era is beginning with the change 
of government. However, when something new begins, optimism is 
compulsory. Therefore, I hope that the majority of our 
politicians have learned something from the experience of the 
past four years -- wherever they were or will be in parliament 
-- and at least they will not make the same mistakes too often.

<F P=106> [Second of two installments of interview with President Ion </F>
Iliescu by Jean Mirot of the French daily LE FIGARO; place and 
date not given: "Romania -- An Open Country"] 
  [Text] [Mirot] We have not heard you talk too much about 
the tragedy of Yugoslavia, one of your closest neighbors. Your 
foreign minister was reminding me of a smart saying: "Romania's 
only sure neighbor is the Black Sea." What are your feelings 
about this Yugoslav drama, an issue on which I believe you are 
more on the side of the Serbs than of the others? 
  [Iliescu] We are "pro-Yugoslavs." Talking about our 
neighbors, we could say that, throughout history, Romania's best 
neighbors were the Serbs and Yugoslavs, regardless of the type 
of state that existed on their territory. We have never fought 
against each other throughout history. On the contrary, we have 
been on the same side of the barricade. We suffered the same 
foreign occupations, that is the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian 
occupations, and fought the same two world wars. There has 
always been a feeling of solidarity and mutual sympathy that 
dominated in our relations. From this point of view, we have 
regarded all this process that is currently taking place in 
Yugoslavia as a tragedy, a tragedy of a heroic people. During 
World War II, there were feelings of respect for the Serbs, for 
the Yugoslavs. They had the most important resistance movement 
in Europe against German occupation. They resisted the 
Stalinist pressure in the fifties and enjoyed great prestige. 
  It is appalling for us to see that after those historical 
events that consolidated their unity, this form of state is 
collapsing in the most tragic possible way. I have often 
visited Yugoslavia. In the seventies there were already 
problems, mainly in the economic and social areas. There were 
economic differences and discrepancies between the north, that 
is Slovenia and Croatia, and the south. There was a difference 
of one to six in the proportion of national product between the 
population in Montenegro and Slovenia for example. There were 
even certain disputes in this respect. I was in Montenegro in 
the seventies when there were discussions about the investments 
of Slovene capital, regarded as a means to exploit manpower 
through Slovene capital. The Slovenes in turn were asking 
themselves why should they export their capital to 
less-developed republics, that is, why export the surplus 
capital achieved by them, and so on and so forth. This was the 
period in which Kardelj (Edvard Kardelj, Broz Tito's closest 
associate] sought, with the help of certain amendments to the 
Constitution, to establish a federal fund for the assistance of 
less-developed republics. This means that, as early as that 
period, there were problems and friction that were probably 
triggered by economic problems. 
  What is currently happening in Bosnia is mainly a religious 
conflict, because, generally speaking -- although in a different 
manner -- the Croats and Serbs basically speak the same 
language. I believe that they belong to one and the same nation 
that was separated by history. There were hundreds of years of 
Austro-Hungarian occupation for some of them and Ottoman 
occupation for others. The Croats became Catholics while the 
Serbs remained Orthodox. The Croats are using the Latin 
alphabet, while the Serbs use the Cyrillic alphabet, but in any 
event, they understand each other very well. 
  In Bosnia, there are the Muslims. What does it mean -- 
Muslims? It does not mean Turks, because they are also Serbs or 
Croats who converted to Islam. They had a Constitution of the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, based on the consensus of the 
three ethnic groups. The referendum was based on the principle 
of majority, which was contradicting the constitutional 
principle of the republic, since that was based on the principle 
of consensus. Then, the Bosnian conflict emerged. Before 1990, 
the Croats and Slovenes advanced a proposal to turn the 
federation into a confederation. Maybe that would have been a 
political solution to avoid this breach. But I believe that all 
sides showed a rigid attitude toward these political problems 
that triggered the conflict. It is a pity, because, as I have 
previously said, we are talking about a nation with a quite 
troubled history, and there is a human tragedy taking place 
there. Therefore, we are in favor of all possible solutions 
that would facilitate the accord between the interested sides in 
Yugoslavia. 
  [Mirot] Do you view the economic embargo as an effective 
method of reestablishing peace? As you know, you are suspected 
of violating the embargo on the Danube River. 
  [Iliescu] I know that, and this is not true. There is a 
permanent Western European Union commission that is cooperating 
with us. We endorsed a decision of the United Nations, and as 
far as it is concerned, we showed a correct attitude in 
implementing it. If some incidents have taken place, this can 
happen anywhere. However, from the viewpoint of the state, we 
have taken all possible measures and there is international 
cooperation in supervising and making sure that these measures 
are respected. 
  But, talking about the embargo, I do not believe that it is 
an efficient measure, as practice has demonstrated, just as 
military measures are not sufficient to solve disputes and 
conflicts. On the hand, military conflicts have worsened the 
climate and reduced the potential for dialogue, because other 
aspects appear that make it even less possible to hold dialogue 
after military conflicts. Therefore, I believe that the only 
possible, acceptable, and effective method is to make all 
possible efforts to facilitate communication, ensure dialogue, 
and search for political solutions. 
  [Mirot] After the example of Yugoslavia, the Hungarian 
minority in Romania seems to be complaining about the violation 
of their rights. Is there a risk that at one point "a 
Milosevic" might gather all the Hungarians who live here in 
Romania under the same banner? 
  [Iliescu] We are constantly prepared. We have held talks 
and carried out certain comparative studies regarding the rights 
of minorities in Romania, especially the rights of Hungarians 
and the rights of minorities in Hungary and in any other 
European countries. I do not believe that in the whole of Europe 
there is another country where the ethnic minorities enjoy all 
those rights that the Hungarians currently enjoy in Romania. 
And we can approach all aspects of this issue. The Hungarians 
represent 7 percent of Romania's population, that is, they 
number 1.7 million people. The majority of them live in 
Transylvania, but also in other regions, and there are over 
30,000 Hungarians in Bucharest. 
  [Mirot] And the majority of these 1.7 million are Serbs. 
  [Iliescu] Serbs? 
  [Mirot] Yes. 
  [Iliescu] No. Hungarians. Most of them are living in 
Transylvania. The Serbs are something else. There are other 
nationalities in Romania, who represent 3 percent. We have 
representative of the small groups of ethnic minorities in our 
parliament. We have stipulated in our Constitution that all 
national minorities will be represented in parliament regardless 
of the direct results of the elections. Thus, the 
representation of all minorities in parliament is ensured. 
There are small groups of minorities such as Italians, and even 
they have their representative in parliament. The same can be 
said of Armenians, Greeks, and others. However, the Hungarians 
represent the largest group, thus they have 39 representatives 
in parliament, I mean senators and deputies. They have 
representatives in all municipality, town, and regional councils 
in areas where they live in a larger number. There are only two 
counties where the Hungarians represent the majority of the 
population. And this majority is represented in councils that 
function in these areas. They have education in their mother 
tongue at all levels, starting with elementary school and ending 
with university. They have their press, radio stations, 
television, and every possibility to assert themselves in all 
areas. 
  You will find nothing like that in Hungary. Their reply to 
this is that you will not find such a large minority in their 
country like the Hungarians in Romania. But this is not an 
issue of numbers, but of principle. They made a big fuss about 
the law on their minorities, but no ethnic minority has a 
representative in their parliament and their parliament rejected 
this idea. There is no school where the teaching is in the 
mother tongue of ethnic minorities. All minorities in Hungary 
study their mother tongue as a foreign language, while they play 
the champions on the issue of minorities' rights. 
  From a psychological viewpoint I can understand the attitude 
of the Hungarians. This is a remnant, a vestige of imperial 
nostalgia and all countries that had empires before have the 
same manner. You can see the attitude of the present Russia 
toward all republics that have become independent states. They 
regard the rights of Russians as a fundamental problem. This 
was also the case with the French, with their departments 
oversees, wasn't it? 
  [Mirot] Certainly. 
  [Iliescu] This was the case with the British when they lost 
their empire. Thus, it is natural that the Hungarians have the 
same feelings and this is the core of sensitivity on both sides. 
  The Romanians are one of the oldest nations in Europe. We 
have lived here for thousands of years. When the Roman empire 
started expanding, they found here an organized state of the 
Dacians, our ancestors. For years on end, our ancestors had 
commercial and economic relations with the Greeks and they had 
an organized state. When the Hungarians came to Europe and when 
the Germanic and Slav tribes came to Europe, they found the 
Romanians in their place. Transylvania was the political center 
of the former Dacian state and during the Roman colonization it 
was the political center of the Roman colony, that is Roman 
Dacia. 
  Throughout history, even in the statistics compiled by 
Hungarians or Austrians, the majority population in Transylvania 
was Romanian, but the feudal law included this principle of 
"unio trium nationum" which meant that on the political plane 
the Romanians were not recognized as citizens but as serfs and 
the only ones who had the right to be represented in the 
Transylvanian Diet were Hungarians, Germans, and Secklers. 
There were different statutes for them. This was quite a long 
period in history when Transylvania was an autonomous 
principality. There was a period when Transylvania was 
subordinated to Vienna and there was also a short period of 67 
years when it was subordinated to Budapest. In all these 
periods of time, only the Germans, Hungarians, and Secklers -- 
these last ones are a people of Hungarian origin, but an older 
one that was settled on the boundary of the empire; today they 
form the majority population in two counties in Romania -- thus 
only these three nations had the right to be represented in the 
Diet, but not the Romanians. Thus, you can understand the 
feelings of the Romanians, who fought for centuries on end for 
their national liberation. In 1918, after World War I, when the 
Austro-Hungarian empire collapsed, the national Romanian state 
was established. That was the moment of the liberation of 
Romanians, of self-determination, and of union with the other 
historical provinces that were formerly, that is in the last 
century, liberated from the Turkish domination and Bessarabia 
from the Russian domination. For the first time, a united state 
of Romanians was established. Therefore, on the one hand, there 
are these feelings of the Romanians toward those who wish to 
contest this historic reality, but, on the other hand, we 
understand the Hungarians, too. They were the dominant nation 
-- although they were the minority -- and suddenly became a 
national minority. It is certainly a feeling that we can 
understand. However, we should also understand.... 
  [Mirot] On the other hand, we have learned that in 
Moldova, which was part of Romania, a referendum took place and 
those who wished the unification with Romania -- which is a 
natural feeling -- were defeated. Do you believe that one day 
this unification with Moldova will be achieved? 
  [Iliescu] Today, the problem of unification of the two 
states is not a topical issue because it is a more complicated 
problem. This territory was for the first time occupied by 
Russian in 1812, when Turkey was making preparations for the 
campaign against Napoleon. At that time, Russia was waging a 
six-year war with Turkey. It halted the war with Turkey. This 
was a period when Turkish diplomacy was quite weak and the 
Russians, without winning, succeeded in obtaining a territory 
from the Turks, namely Bessarabia. That was half of the 
historical province of Moldova. Bessarabia became a Russian 
"province" for 100 years, until World War I. After World War I, 
Bessarabia was integrated into the Romanian sate. In 1940, 
through the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, the Soviets not only 
occupied "tsarist" Bessarabia -- a territory occupied by the 
tsars -- but also occupied another territory, namely North 
Bucovina, which has never belonged to Russia. Before World War 
I, this was a land occupied by Austria for 150 years. It was 
included in the Austrian Empire, but it did not belong to 
Russia. However, they occupied this land, claiming that it was a 
sort of "compensation" for the 20 years of occupation of 
Bessarabia by Romania. There was also an interesting event. In 
1965, in North Bucovina, there was a movement of the Romanians 
who said: The 20 years have passed, we should return to 
Romania. There was a certain motion and I was in Suceava 
[northeastern Romania] near the border and I was told that there 
were many families with relations on the two sides of the border 
and those families said: Our people say that it is high time 
for the return of our land. But certainly, when the Russians 
occupy a land, they never withdraw. 
  They did something else, something that the Tsarist regime 
had never done before. They divided the land into three parts: 
They incorporated the southern and northern parts in Ukraine -- 
this was carried out by Stalin and Khrushchev who was first 
party secretary in Ukraine -- and they also attached a 
territory, the Dniester, which did not belong to Romania. but 
which was also created by Stalin in 1942, as an "autonomous 
republic" of Moldova, probably having the idea of annexing the 
other part of Moldova, too, that is, Bessarabia. Then, they 
created a situation that is more complex today, when we can no 
longer talks about a whole land. The Republic of Moldova was 
proclaimed on the territory of the Soviet Republic of Moldova. 
This includes only a part of the territory occupied by the 
Soviets and, before then, for one century by the Russians, and 
another territory, that is, Dniester. There is a movement of 
Russians there who claim that if Moldova unites with Romania, 
they want guarantees that they are going to stay outside 
Romania's borders. This is the Dniester conflict. Thus, from 
this point of view, the situation in Moldova is quite sensitive, 
with pro-Russian movements and with the quite-complex feelings 
of the Romanians who live there and represent the majority of 
the population; 65 percent of the population are Romanians. 
However, there is also the problem of the other territories. 
  We have always approached these problems in a realistic 
manner. We believe that in politics one should take into 
consideration current historical realities. Otherwise, there 
will be no peace in Europe, because there are innumerable border 
problems such as the problem of Germans in Koenigsberg and the 
other territories, the Poles with their border problems, and 
even the French and the Hungarians and all the others have such 
problems. Therefore, one should take into consideration the 
current realities, with the current borders, and we believe that 
the only criteria to be considered are the post-war 
understandings, treaties, the Helsinki documents, and the Paris 
Charter. Thus, we recognized the independent Moldovan state. 
We regard it as the second Romanian state, but only history can 
tell what will be the fate of this state. There is no need to 
create new tension now. This is not in Moldova's interest, it 
is not in the interest of the Romanian state, and of peace in 
general to stir this issue. One should take realities into 
consideration. We will have to support the development of 
direct relations and this is already a gain. Previously, during 
the rule of the Soviet Union, we could have no direct relations 
with Chisinau and with that region. All problems had to be 
discussed with Moscow. But today we have another situation, 
because we can have direct contact and human contact. We do 
have this possibility now. We believe that the only solution is 
to take concrete steps and develop economic, cultural, 
spiritual, scientific, and human relations and to establish an 
unhampered system of communication. 
  [Mirot] I have a last question, so that I do not take up too 
much of your time. Bucharest used to be called the "little 
Paris"; you speak excellent French, and it is true that we, the 
French, feel somehow at home here. I hope that this feeling 
will be mutual when you are in Paris. However, we are a little 
worried about the Francophony and the strong offensive of the 
English language. Your generation speaks French excellently, 
however, under the Ceausescu regime, obviously there was a lapse 
in the use of the French language. What do you do currently to 
relaunch Francophony? 
  [Iliescu] First of all, I would like to stress a few 
fundamental ideas. Regardless of the political orientation, 
political groups, or personal orientations, I believe that there 
is a unanimous feeling among Romanians as far as relations with 
France and the attitude toward France are concerned. This is 
not only a sentimental issue. This is connected with our Latin 
origin -- because we are situated on the eastern side of the 
Latin world and we are also an island of Latinity in a Slav 
world -- but also because throughout history we have had direct 
connections with France and all Romanians could feel the support 
granted by France as decisive in certain tragic moments or 
decisive moments for our country. 
  On the one hand, France discharged a spiritual influence in 
the past because it was at the forefront of modern changes in 
Europe -- the French revolution and the enlightened ideas of the 
French realism -- and many Romanian intellectuals were educated 
in France. During the 1848 revolutionary movement, there was a 
direct link between the French and Romanian revolutionary 
movements. Our struggle for national assertion and for national 
independence were constantly supported by France. During World 
War I, the time when the Romanian united national state was 
established, the political support granted by France was 
decisive -- Trianon was a decisive moment for us from this point 
of view -- and, as a result of it, all these historical ties 
created a general feeling in all Romanians for France, feelings 
of sympathy and solidarity throughout history with France. 
Therefore, the establishment of privileged relations with France 
have always been a constant and dominant part of our foreign 
policy. This is also a constant feature of our current foreign 
policy as well. 
  However, we have a certain feeling of apprehension regarding 
the official position towards an interest of some circles in 
France to sustain and support the political wish of Romanians. 
This feeling of apprehension is also caused by the fact that 
even the French mass media sometimes expresses attitudes that 
are not always friendly toward the processes that are currently 
taking place in Romanian society. If you wish, I can tell you 
that, in a way, the Romanians expect France to play a role 
toward Romania that is similar to the role played by West 
Germany toward East Germany. Maybe, in this case, the ties are 
less strong. In case of Germany we are talking about a 
completely united community, but we would like France to show 
the same feelings. 
  Certainly, we are not denying the constant support that 
France granted to Romania after the revolution -- immediately 
after and throughout this period -- in European institutions 
such as the Council of Europe and the European Union. We have 
greatly appreciated this support. Our relations are generally 
good but, since you started discussing this subject, I would 
like to use this opportunity to tell you that the Romanians 
expect a more open attitude. I cannot deny that we feel 
France's friendly attitude toward us, but we would like to see a 
greater interest, mainly coming from business circles. We are 
in the middle of a very dynamic period of economic development 
and Francophony is not only a sentimental issue. If it is not 
supported with fundamental relations, through economic activity, 
it might suffer, even if we take into consideration the current 
feelings and the feelings that we will always nurture for France. 
  [Mirot] We hope that your official trip to France.... 
  [Iliescu] I hope too. Even if the Germans are busy with the 
territories in the east, are much more dynamic. They make less 
noise and less fuss, but are very efficient and active. The 
Italians are more active, too. They have political difficulties 
but, as businessmen, they are more dynamic than the French. 
  [Mirot] This is true. You are right. You are criticizing 
us in the mass media for the attitude that we show for Romania, 
maybe also for a certain worsening of the situation, which is no 
doubt connected with the revolution. The French mass media 
showed some reticence when reporting about your country, but we 
can assure you that we continue to love Romania. 
  [Iliescu] I think that the French can understand better now 
the "miners incursions" [in Bucharest in 1990]. 
  [Mirot] Absolutely. 
  [Iliescu] I do not believe that there can be anybody who 
believes that young people's movements are manipulated by the 
presidents of the republic. 
  [Mirot] Absolutely not. 
  [Iliescu] But as far as the "miners incursions" are 
concerned, the French mass media took over the slogans that were 
disseminated in our country. 
  [Mirot] Mr. President, thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Genka Markova: "They Embraced Disgrace"] </F>
  [Text] The government received a vote of confidence. Long 
live the parliament! 
  Today, now, this very moment, there is no glory for the 
Bulgarian politicians. 
  Long live the disgrace! 
  Some 125 people's representatives opted for the disgrace! 
They opted for prolonging the country's agony, hoping that, 
thus, they can prolong their own agony at least until the fall. 
At least this is how things look now. After exhausting 
haggling and consultations it became clear that the ugly and 
cynical trading ostensibly related to the fate of the cabinet is 
actually a life and death struggle for the parliament's fate. 
  During the last, tumultuous, parliamentary-political week, 
the people saw the naked truth about their politicians. It 
became pitilessly clear that the moral value of the Bulgarian 
deputy is catastrophically low. Against every political, human, 
and medical logic, the talks related to reshuffling the cabinet 
will begin again. 
  This is the situation, people! 
  A few days before their disgraceful spectacle, a deputy said 
that it is not the cabinet that is wrong, but the people who 
sent such deputies to the parliament. Actually, this specific 
deputy also was a prime minister and the sweet pleasures of his 
tenure are still fresh in our memory. 
  The petty, secret, and tactical games until the last moment 
yesterday night, and even during the voting itself, exceeded the 
elementary norms of political moral. Cynicism replaced the oath 
of the Bulgarian deputies that they will be led in all their 
actions by the interests of the people. Is there anything 
common between the cabinet's policy, the implementation of the 
economic reforms, and the interests of the people? There is no 
need to answer this question. 
  The agony of our state has continued for several months 
already and new complications are yet to appear. The parliament 
decided to hide behind the government by giving it its vote of 
confidence for the future, despite the fact that the government 
has done nothing in the past. 
  The Bulgarians are traditionally generous toward their inept 
politicians. Thank God, however, that they have not lost their 
memory!

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov by </F>
Georgi Kardanov in Sofia on 26 May: "Current Political 
Situation Should Not Affect Subordination in the Army"] 
  [Text] Despite the heavy parliamentary program connected 
with debating the vote of confidence requested by Professor 
Berov and the tension surrounding some government ministers, 
before the secret ballot began, Defense Minister Valentin 
Aleksandrov found time to grant a brief interview to a BULGARSKA 
ARMIYA reporter. 
  [Kardanov] Mr. Minister, if the government obtains a vote of 
confidence, what will be the first matter that Minister Valentin 
Aleksandrov will address? 
  [Aleksandrov] Along with these demands for the government to 
resign and these numerous votes of confidence that have been 
moved, a considerable number of problems have accumulated that 
require solutions, so how can one decide which of them is the 
most pressing? I have the feeling that some officers seem to 
have forgotten that the most important thing in the army today 
is to obey the orders of one's superiors. Regardless of the 
current political situation, this subordination, as well as 
order and discipline, must be strictly observed in the army and 
the armed forces, otherwise we will have no army. During this 
severe political crisis, it is clear that an extreme 
psychological load is placed on the troops, which is especially 
harmful for subordination. 
  [Kardanov] Certain parliamentary forces and political 
circles have supported the view that your demand for certain 
high-ranking officers to be retired has created tension in the 
army. What is your counterargument? 
  [Aleksandrov] Look here, the General Staff has carefully 
drafted a plan that completely conforms with my views, so that 
the dismissal of the officers concerned is completely within the 
order of things, and it will take place in the fall. I do not 
see any grounds for tension as a result of this fact, or at 
least cannot not accept the force of these grounds, even in the 
event that the Defense and Armed Forces Act is not passed, and I 
personally cannot undertake to affirm that parliament will 
indeed pass it. 
  [Kardanov] You mentioned the words "in the event that the 
Defense and the Armed Forces Act is not passed...." Prime 
Minister Lyuben Berov's short-term program envisages passing the 
law before the end of June, yet yesterday Ahmed Dogan, chairman 
of the parliamentary group of the Rights and Freedoms Movement, 
told a reporter that one should not be too hasty to pass the 
law, that it is a very extensive piece of legislation, so that 
there is hardly likely to be time to pass it. What is the true 
situation? 
  [Aleksandrov] I cannot say which is best, but in any case 
the The Defense and the Armed Forces Act should be carefully 
examined from all angles. It is better for us to continue to 
work with the existing law to give time to precisely formulate 
the new legislative material. I do not want to commit myself to 
making a personal assessment of the bill that has been 
submitted, because I am the proposer. In any case, we cannot 
influence the politicians and legislators regarding their 
priorities. On the other hand, this issue has begun to be 
interpreted too much on a personal level, and for this reason I 
prefer to make no comment. 
  [Kardanov] The National Security Commission is doing 
everything possible to speed up the ordering of all the 
amendments and proposals connected with the defense and armed 
forces bill, so they can be passed on to the Legislative 
Commission and reach the parliament voting stage more quickly. 
  [Aleksandrov] Yes, it is true that the National Security 
Commission is well advanced with preparing all the passages of 
the bill, but nevertheless one should not be in too much of a 
hurry, so as to avoid having to pass a new law in a year or two. 
  [Kardanov] Minister Aleksandrov, even if the defense and 
armed forces bill, which is supposed to provide the legislative 
basis for the democratic reform in the Armed Forces, is delayed, 
at least the Law on the Consultative Council on National 
Security was passed. Are you satisfied with the work of this 
supreme body, which is supposed to coordinate the efforts of all 
the country's institutions that are concerned with national 
security? 
  [Aleksandrov] Yes, I have twice attended sessions of the 
council and I can say that both times they debated important 
issues of national security that had a positive effect. This 
gives me good reason to hope that it will also continue to do 
useful and constructive work in the future.

<F P=106> ["Resolution of Supreme Council of Bulgarian Socialist Party </F>
and Socialist Deputies," adopted at the Bulgarian Socialist 
Party Supreme Council plenum held in Sofia on 21 May] 
  [Text] The joint meeting of the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist 
Party] Supreme Council and the Socialist deputies held in Sofia 
on 21 May, after analyzing the deepening political crisis 
comprehensively, resolved as follows: 
  1. The BSP Supreme Council and Socialist deputies authorize 
the BSP parliamentary group to reach a decision on supporting or 
rejecting the vote of confidence that the prime minister has 
requested, depending on whether acceptable proposals are made on 
changing the government's membership and policies. If no such 
proposals are made, there will be no grounds for supporting the 
government. In such an event, the only solution will be to hold 
free democratic elections as soon as possible. 
  Our position is dictated by our conclusion that, with its 
present membership and activities, the government does not enjoy 
the degree of trust needed to resolve the real and grave 
problems facing Bulgaria today. 
  2. The BSP is ready immediately to join bilateral and 
multilateral talks under the aegis of the prime minister. The 
purpose of these talks would be to try to revise the 
unacceptable points in the Council of Ministers's program of 18 
May and provide legislative guarantees for carrying out the most 
important tasks included in this program. 
  3. The BSP proposes including the following commitments in a 
framework agreement: 
  -- The Council of Ministers should compensate the 
population's incomes, which have fallen drastically as a result 
of the price shocks in March and April 1994; it should repeal 
the section of Council of Ministers Decree No. 77 that froze the 
pay of employees in the state-financed sphere; and it should 
immediately reactivate the work of the National Council for 
Trilateral Cooperation. 
  -- The parliamentary groups that support the government 
should pass the following legislation: in June 1994, the 
changes in the Privatization Act and privatization programs; in 
July, the Law on Defense and the Armed Forces; and, before the 
end of the summer session, the necessary laws on holding free 
democratic elections, as well as continuing work on the bills on 
protective bankruptcy and insolvency. 
  4. The BSP considers that the initiative that the president 
of the Republic of Bulgaria took on 20 May 1994 can be discussed 
when the constitutional need arises, within the framework of the 
mandates held by the parliamentary groups for forming a new 
government. The BSP reaffirms its determination not to 
participate in any attempts to form within the term of the 
present parliament a new government along the lines of political 
confrontation, revanchism, or restoration of the old regime. 
  5. The BSP reaffirms its unchanged position that Bulgaria's 
main problems can only be solved by constructive political 
dialogue. At the final stage of concluding the agreement on the 
foreign debt, any government must win broad parliamentary 
consensus, based on an analysis of the internal and external 
resources for financing the debt and the country's ability to 
bear the burden. 
  6. The BSP Supreme Council and Parliamentary Union for 
Social Democracy [PSSD] confirm the mandate given to the BSP 
Executive Bureau and the PSSD leadership to analyze the 
situation, define the position of the BSP, and conduct 
negotiations.

    [Editorial Report] Sofia Khorizont Radio Network in 
Bulgarian at 0758 GMT on 27 May begins a live relay of the 
morning session of the National Assembly in Sofia, where Indian 
President Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma is scheduled to address 
deputies. 
  At 0801 a correspondent reports that Dr. Sharma's arrival 
seems to have been delayed, and proceeds to summarize the 
proceedings of the preceding ministers' question time session. 
He says that Prime Minister Berov answered a Union of 
Democratic Forces (SDS) question on the government's financial 
policy, following which an SDS vote of censure was defeated. 
After this, Industry Minister Rumen Bikov answered a question 
on the Neftokhim Oil Refinery. 
  At 0810 GMT the correspondent announces the arrival of Dr. 
Sharma. National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov formally 
introduces Dr. Sharma and invites him to speak. 
  Dr. Sharma begins his speech in his native language, with a 
simultaneous Bulgarian translation read out by the 
correspondent. After a formal expression of thanks, he reviews 
the development of the young Indian democracy, praising the key 
contribution of Nehru, and quoting his words: "Democracy is not 
merely a political and economic matter, but something linked 
with reason. It includes the maximum equality of opportunity 
for all people in political and economic respects; and it 
includes liberty for the individual to develop his best 
qualities." He notes that this year is the 30th anniversary of 
the death of "the outstanding world leader" Jawaharlal Nehru, 
"who provided an invaluable contribution to the cause of 
parliamentary democracy," whose spirit "is present today in the 
life of the institutions and processes of democracy in India," 
and "whose contribution is of immense importance for the 
dynamics of politics throughout the world." 
  At 0821 GMT he offers India's warm greetings and good wishes 
to the Bulgarian parliament, "democratically elected as the 
result of the first multiparty elections in your country." He 
reminds the deputies: "You represent the will of your people." 
  Dr. Sharma then reviews the historical development of 
"spirit 
of democracy in India." He notes that "the Buddha's legacy and 
testament" "influenced the establishment of pluralism and 
harmony." This and the ancient Vedic teachings are "key 
concepts" that lie behind present-day political life in India. 
Further to this, Dr. Sharma notes, "respect for the law is a 
permanent feature" of our spirit. "In our society, the law is 
historically identified with the truth, and not merely as a 
mechanism for ensuring law and order." He reviews the 
development of basic elements of parliamentary democracy in 
ancient India, including "the establishment and functioning of a 
representative assembly,... quorums, open voting, and secret 
ballots." He says "this created a lasting tradition of 
democratic mechanisms," and notes the important role of the 
traditional rural councils in India. 
  Further, Dr. Sharma notes that "these democratic traditions 
and values substantially influenced the main features of our 
liberation movement," based on the campaign launched by Mahatma 
Gandhi in the name of "human liberty, dignity, and nonviolence." 
He emphasizes the peaceful and nonviolent nature of the 
independence struggle. 
  The Indian president goes on to declare that "parliamentary 
democracy is the political system that most suits the cultural 
character and political aspirations of India." He notes that 
"elections are a key aspect of the democratic process," and that 
almost 280 million voted in the last Indian parliamentary 
elections. However, Dr. Sharma says, "democracy is not only a 
matter of elections." He points out that "true democracy is a 
synthesis of the rights and obligations of the individual and 
the state," that "democratic politics personify the principles 
of consistency and change that are so important for the life of 
a nation," and that "discipline and restraint are decisive 
elements that determine whether a democratic system develops or 
disintegrates." He says that "democratic consensus and national 
development can only exist when peace and understanding are 
present," and that the equality of all citizens before the law 
is also an important component. 
  At 0832 he refers to the recent visits of the chairman of 
the 
lower house of the Indian parliament to Bulgaria, and of 
National Assembly Chairman Yordanov to India with a 
parliamentary delegation. He hopes that these fruitful 
parliamentary contacts will continue and develop, promoting 
cooperation and mutual understanding. Dr. Sharma ends his 
formal speech at 0835. 
  National Assembly Speaker Yordanov thanks Dr. Sharma for his 
exposition of the principles governing democracy as developed in 
India. He assures the Indian president "that your visit to the 
Republic of Bulgaria really opens a new page in the relations 
between our two countries," and then declares a 10-minute 
recess. The relay ends at 0838.

  [Text] On 31 May Oleg Lobov, chief secretary of the 
Russian Federation Security Council, and the deputy ministers 
and experts accompanying him had a meeting with Prime Minister 
Lyuben Berov. 
  Mr. Lobov conveyed the cordial greetings of Russian 
President 
Yeltsin and Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. Both think that full 
Bulgarian-Russian relations must be restored in all spheres -- 
defense, transportation, economy, culture, health protection, 
and so forth -- as soon as possible, Mr. Lobov told the 
Bulgarian prime minister. After the meeting at the Council of 
Ministers a protocol was signed on the talks that were conducted 
between the Bulgarian and Russian delegations. 
  Oleg Lobov, chief secretary of the Russian Federation 
Security Council, and Deputy Prime Minister Evgeniy Matinchev, 
chairman of the Interdepartmental Council on Issues of 
Military-Industrial Complex, initialed an agreement on 
establishing a Bulgarian-Russian Intergovernmental Commission on 
Cooperation in the Defense Industry. 
  Regarding the issue of the Russian debts to Bulgaria, Lobov 
said his country insists on paying the debt with spare parts and 
equipment for the Bulgarian Army, as already agreed. He 
expressed his hope that trade between the two countries, which 
according to Russian statistics increased 30 percent in 1993, 
could increase even more during the current year. Lobov views 
with favor the possibility of Bulgaria becoming a distributor of 
Russian gas in the Balkans.

  [Text] We have just received a statement from the 
president's office: Republic of Croatia President Franjo 
Tudjman received a delegation of the Croat republic of 
Herzeg-Bosna in the presidential palace today. The delegation 
was headed by Prime Minister Jadranko Prlic. They talked about 
the further implementation of the Washington agreement. The 
delegation stressed that the power supply system and 
telecommunications should be restored as soon as possible across 
the entire federation and that they should be linked to the 
Republic of Croatia. They also stressed the need for the return 
of refugees and displaced people within the federation, in line 
with the Washington agreement. 
  Expressing support for the delegation in its efforts to 
normalize the situation as soon as possible and introduce new 
relations on the basis of the Washington agreement, President 
Tudjman suggested that individual Croatian counties [words 
indistinct] help in concrete terms in restoring some Croatian 
[word indistinct] in the federation's ruined areas. 
  President Tudjman launched an initiative for establishing a 
separate Croatian committee which will [word indistinct] trust 
and develop relations between the Croatian and the Bosniak 
people within the federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 
confederation with the Republic of Croatia in the economic 
sphere, and in education, health care, culture, and all

<F P=106> [Speakers identified by caption; passages within quotation </F>
marks are recorded; relayed by Warsaw TV Polonia Network] 
  [Excerpts] Journalists from the British television company 
Channel 4 claim that 16 containers loaded with arms were 
exported to Iraq from the Lucznik plant in Radom in February. 
The management of the plant denies that this shipment ever took 
place. The Central Engineering Board has given assurances that 
it had never granted permission for any shipment to Iraq. 
  [Reporter] British journalists say they received information 
about the Polish shipment of arms to Iraq from very reliable 
sources which they cannot disclose. 
  [Chris Mitchell, Channel 4 journalist, in English with 
superimposed Polish translation] "We got the information at the 
beginning of the year. We were told that 16 gray, unmarked 
containers would leave the Lucznik plant in Radom. We were told 
that they depart for the Black Sea coast, to Varna, and we were 
told they would be shipped onto Akaba via Cyprus." 
  [Reporter] Journalists saw only eight containers leaving the 
plant but they think some could have been sent earlier. They 
have not seen their contents but they think the very fact that 
sewing machines are being sent to the Middle East in unmarked 
containers confirms their suspicions. 
  [Mitchell] "But what was very striking was that the 
information we had received corresponded to what we saw later 
and to what Mr. Szwonder told us." 
  [Reporter] The former Lucznik manager and presently the 
Democratic Left Alliance senator has told GAZETA WYBORCZA daily 
that he only spoke to British journalists about legal exports of 
arms to Yemen. The current management of the plant also denies 
the British journalists' accusations. 
  [Bronislaw Kilian, Lucznik manager] "This event which is 
supposedly described by the British television program has not 
taken place. It is some kind of mistake and in my opinion yet 
another provocation." 
  [Reporter] "Provocation by whom?" 
  [Kilian] "Well, certainly not by our side." 
  [Reporter] "By whom do you think?" 
  [Kilian] "Well, it is in someone's interest." 
  [Reporter] Polish authorities which supervise the arms trade 
think the story told by the British journalists is not specific 
enough. [passage omitted] The British journalists' program 
will most probably be screened on Channel 4 tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Vaclav Havel by Premysl Svora; </F>
place and date not given: "Our Relations Will Never Be Standard 
Ones"] 
  [Text] Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel arrives 
today on a one-day working visit to the Slovak Republic. Apart 
from holding talks with his Slovak counterpart, Michal Kovac, he 
will also meet Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik, representatives 
from nongovernment organizations, and a group of intellectuals. 
He will visit the Society for Foreign Policy and, in the 
evening, he will attend a theater performance of Cyrano de 
Bergerac. Prior to his visit, Vaclav Havel granted an interview 
to our daily. 
  [Svora] Mr. President, the Czech Republic is of late 
becoming ever more distinct from the other postcommunist 
countries. What do you think of this? Not so long ago, you 
said that the term postcommunist country should no longer be 
used.... 
  [Havel] First of all, I would like to emphasize that, in the 
statement you quoted, I was not insisting that the Czech 
Republic be described differently from the other countries 
convulsed by communism. This term should not be applied to any 
of these countries. Of course, it depends on what we mean by 
the term postcommunist country. I had in mind the period in 
which communism had been overthrown, but in which not all of the 
state's democratic and political structures had yet been 
established. I meant that the aforementioned term should be 
applied to this transitional period. If we perceive this word in 
this way, then the time has come for us to stop using it. Free 
elections have been held in all of these countries, political 
parties have been formed, and democratic mechanisms have begun 
to function normally. If, however, by the term postcommunist 
country we mean countries in which there has been communism at 
some time, then we may be described as postcommunist countries 
for the next 100 years. 
  [Svora] All the same, the Czech Republic has -- in a certain 
way -- become singled out from the transforming countries by its 
economic results in particular.... 
  [Havel] It is perhaps true that the macroeconomic indicators 
are better in the Czech Republic than in other states. There 
are various reasons for this. First and foremost, the Czech 
lands have always been industrially more developed. This, 
however, is not the only reason. It has also asserted rapid 
economic transformation. The fact that the Czech Republic is 
better off from an economic point of view should not have any 
political consequences. I think that the principle of 
solidarity should apply in the Central European region. 
  [Svora] Like Presidents Kovac and Walesa, you have indicated 
more than once that you do not want to be merely an inactive 
observer of political development. However, your activities 
often meet with a lack of understanding on the part of the other 
elements of power. How do you perceive the role of a president 
in our geopolitical region? 
  [Havel] It ensues incontrovertibly from the constitutional 
division of power in the state that each [element] enjoys a 
differently enshrined form of jurisdiction and a different type 
of legitimacy. This has its advantages. For example, when 
there is a change in the government, the president comes to the 
forefront and represents the continuity of power and so on. 
There is a certain tension between prime ministers and 
presidents in all countries, not just in ours. However, it is 
perceived much more sensitively in view of the long absence of a 
democratic system. The same thing holds true for all 
presidents, however; they should not fulfill merely a ceremonial 
function. In this case, the question would arise whether the 
function of president could not be carried out concurrently, for 
example, by the prime minister. 
  [Svora] The aforementioned triumvirate of presidents is also 
linked by something else: They are in office more or less 
without those with whom they had cooperated closely in the past. 
Which of your former friends do you still have left? 
  [Havel] I am a conservative person. If someone is my 
friend, then he remains a friend for life. It just so happens 
with my friends from dissent that sometimes they are involved 
more in political life, sometimes less. I meet with some often 
and with others seldom; sometimes our views are similar, other 
times they are not so similar. However, this should not -- and 
does not -- alter the fact that we are still friends. Despite 
the fact that I have little time, I meet with all sorts of 
people, including my old friends. Every two weeks, I organize a 
meeting with various personalities in the presidential Amalia 
residence. Around 300 different people have already taken part 
in them. 
  [Svora] You once said in an interview for the former SMENA 
that you do not want to be a president-grave digger. Despite 
this, you were the last Czechoslovak president. With the 
passage of time, what is your assessment of the breakup of 
Czechoslovakia? 
  [Havel] For many citizens in the Czech Republic, and also in 
Slovakia, the breakup of the Federation came as a real blow. 
They were used to a homeland that had a different dimension, 
not only geographically, but also culturally and historically. 
And, all of a sudden, this homeland diminished in size. 
However, thanks to the decent way in which the breakup took 
place, people have come to terms with it relatively well. 
  I resigned from my post as federal president for various 
reasons. One of them was that I did not want to stand in the 
way of a development that I saw as irreversible. And I had to. 
Undoubtedly, I would have been faced with the task of signing 
the official law on breaking up the state. How could a 
president who had sworn his oath of office on the Czechoslovak 
Constitution sign this law? It seemed to me that I would make 
the situation easier for everyone if I resigned. 
  [Svora] The number of voices calling for standardized 
Czech-Slovak relations is increasing in the Czech Republic. In 
principle, apparently, there cannot be any difference between 
Australia, Portugal, and Slovakia.... 
  [Havel] I believe that order makes friends. We are two 
states and we must have the basic attributes of statehood. We 
have our ambassador in your country and you have your ambassador 
in our country, we have a demarcated border, we have customs 
officers, and so on. It is necessary to have these basic 
attributes of statehood. This does not mean, however, that if we 
have standard requirements, we also have to have standard 
relations. We will always be linked to such an extent by our 
common history and similar language that our mutual relations 
will never be standard ones. 
  [Svora] What do you expect from today's visit to Slovakia? 
  [Havel] I am looking forward to my talks with President 
Kovac. I am curious about his interpretation of the current 
political situation in Slovakia prior to the early parliamentary 
elections. I expect not only a further exchange of views on 
various topics, but perhaps also an agreement on certain 
standpoints and initiatives.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian </F>
Democratic Movement, KDH, by Alena Melicharkova; place and date 
not given: "Everyone Is Condemned To Pursue Right-Wing Policies"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Melicharkova] The left has 
been victorious in several postcommunist countries, including 
Poland and Hungary. Some political scientists expect a similar 
development also in our country. They even say that, in a 
certain way, those election results demonstrate distrust of 
changes and the market system. What if the left actually wins 
in Slovakia? 
  [Carnogursky] As a democrat I respect, and will respect, the 
legitimate results of democratic elections. Should the voters 
really vote more in favor of the left, let them have a left-wing 
government. The Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] would still 
stick to its right-wing positions, to the socially oriented 
market economy. But let us look at some factors from the past. 
Before the last elections, the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia [HZDS] was promising an economic policy geared toward 
development that would be completely different from the 
federally applied reform. Three months after the elections, 
when the late Professor Koctuch returned from the United States, 
from talks with the IMF, the HZDS immediately changed its entire 
economic concept and acknowledged that right-wing economic 
policy was the only option. That is why, deep within, I chuckle 
when you ask me what will happen if left-wing parties win. Even 
if this happened, it would be only a question of time before 
they realized that they must pursue right-wing policies. After 
all, even [Party of the Democratic Left Chairman] Peter Weiss 
said in a newspaper interview about a year ago that the economic 
policy of the Party of the Democratic Left was to the right of 
the HZDS's economic policy. And, mind you, that was after 
Professor Koctuch's return from the United States. 
  [Melicharkova] Is the formation of a coalition government 
composed in the same way as the present government possible 
after the elections, in your opinion? 
  [Carnogursky] The present term of office is also a trial 
period whether such a coalition can continue even after the 
elections. It seems, for the time being, that it might.

  [Text] Cairo, May 31 (TANJUG) -- A nonaligned ministerial 
conference will open in Cairo on Tuesday and for the first time 
since the foundation of the [Nonaligned] Movement [NAM] it will 
not be attended by officials from Yugoslavia, one of its 
founders and the host of its first summit. This is the result 
of an arbitrary behaviour of the host of the conference, Egypt, 
whose Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa had decided "not to allow 
Serbia" to participate in the meeting for two reasons: because 
he does not recognize the right of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia to succession and because of what he described as 
"Belgrade's involvement in Bosnia and Croatia." 
  Instead of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Egypt invited 
to the conference Moslem officials from the former Yugoslav 
republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as those from Croatia 
and Slovenia. Officials from Greece, Bulgaria and many 
countries of the former Soviet Union and some West European 
countries will be present as guests or observers. The agenda of 
the conference, to be opened by Egyptian President Husni 
Mubarak, will include the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
conflicts in Rwanda, Cambodia and Yemen, the Movement's future 
in the light of the new world order and economic problems of the 
member-countries.

  [Text] At a news conference today, the Fatherland Party of 
Labor and George Ganchev expressed regret that Professor Berov 
had been readmitted to the government hospital. On hearing 
this, the Government Press Center was not slow to react, 
describing such reports as false. It added that Prof. Berov had 
three official meetings in the government offices today: with 
the Japanese and Argentine ambassadors, and with a Russian 
Government delegation.

  [Text] Prague, May 29 (CTK) -- Industry and Trade Minister 
Vladimir Dlouhy today told CTK that Chilean General Augusto 
Pinochet was considered in his country a "standard 
representative of certain circles" and if he came to the Czech 
Republic to negotiate trade deals he would not to take a stand 
on his visit. "That is the prerogative of other bodies in this 
country," Dlouhy said. 
  He emphasized that he had neither been briefed on Pinochet's 
visit beforehand nor asked to meet or negotiate with him. He 
said, however, he did not rule out the possibility of his 
ministry, as the license administration, being asked to agree to 
arms exports -- but to Chile, not General Pinochet, he stressed. 
  If Pinochet concluded the deals planned, according to valid 
Czech law the ministry would certainly take a position on it, 
Dlouhy said, adding that the ministry's position would not be 
absolutely dependent on whether it was Pinochet or someone else 
who negotiated the deals. 
  What is important is not that it is Pinochet who is leading 
the Chilean delegation but that the delegation will come to buy 
Czech weapons, Dlouhy said. If Pinochet comes as an official 
representative of the Chilean Armed Forces then some contract 
would probably be agreed upon and the possible exports of 
armaments would have to be approved by the license 
administration, Dlouhy said. 
  Consideration will be given to whether Chile is among 
countries to which the Czech Republic wants to limit arms 
exports to or not. "Chile is today a democratic country and I 
would therefore expect that the stand would be positive if the 
final user of weapons is clear. But I cannot say beforehand," 
he added.

  [Text] Prague, May 30 (CTK) -- Armored vehicles are 
expected to be the main commodity in which the Chilean 
delegation headed by former dictator Augusto Pinochet will be 
interested during its forthcoming visit to the Czech Republic, 
CTK learnt today from well-informed diplomatic sources. 
  According to the latest information, Pinochet should arrive 
at Prague's Ruzyne Airport from Amsterdam after 3:00 P.M. today. 
The place in which he will stay in Prague remains unclear. The 
Chilean Embassy, which is one of the possibilities, refused to 
give any information to CTK. A bigger part of the Chilean 
mission will stay in the Inter-Continental Hotel, it seems. 
  According to unofficial information, Pinochet, now the 
supreme commander of the Chilean Army ground force, is expected 
to stay in Prague until June 4. In the course of his private 
visit he is scheduled to visit the IDET '94 international 
exhibition of military equipment in Brno, south Moravia, and 
visit several places outside Prague, the diplomatic source 
revealed.

  [Text] Prague May 30 (CTK) -- In connection with the 
announced visit of Chilean Ground Forces Chief Commander Augusto 
Pinochet, President Vaclav Havel believes that it would benefit 
Czech-Chilean relations if they were developed by figures 
respected in the democratic world, Havel's spokesman Ladislav 
Spacek told CTK today. 
  "The president is convinced that the democratic system in 
Chile is lasting and stable. But it would benefit bilateral 
relations between the Czech Republic and Chile if they were 
developed by personalities who are accepted in the democratic 
world without reservations," Spacek said. He said the 
Presidential Office had today received letters from journalists 
addressed to Havel and denouncing Pinochet's visit. Spacek said 
that Havel already spoke critically of the forthcoming visit at 
a press conference in Bratislava last Thursday [26 May]. 
  "The visit does not have an official character and neither 
the president nor his office has been informed of it in advance. 
The Czech Republic is opening its border to all people having 
valid travel documents. The president only takes note of the 
visit," Spacek said.

  [Text] Prague May 30 (CTK) -- Former Chilean President 
Augusto Pinochet should not have been granted an entry visa to 
the Czech Republic, Interior Minister Jan Ruml told Czech 
Television today. A Chilean military delegation arrived today 
in Prague to negotiate arms deals with the Omnipol company, but 
the arrival of Chilean Ground Forces Chief Commander Augusto 
Pinochet has not been confirmed although it had been notified. 
  "However, if he got it and is here, I will not draw any 
conclusion as interior minister," Ruml added. The Interior 
Ministry will not provide protection to Pinochet because his 
visit is private and the Foreign Ministry has not asked for it, 
Ruml said.

  [Text] Prague May 30 (CTK) -- "Murderer, where are our 
brothers?" reads the banner unfolded today by Jan Chladek and 
Marek Mamon outside the Chilean Embassy. A Chilean military 
delegation arrived today in Prague, but the arrival of Chilean 
Ground Forces Chief Commander Augusto Pinochet has not been 
confirmed although it had been notified. 
  Chladek said that Pinochet's visit had a special meaning for 
him. He said he was born in Chile to a Czech father and Chilean 
mother whose family had suffered a great deal under Pinochet's 
regime, losing several of its members. After a calm 
intervention by the Czech Police, the demonstrators removed the 
banner.

  [Text] Prague May 30 (CTK) -- Indignation at the arrival 
of former Chilean President and current Ground Forces Chief 
Commander Augusto Pinochet's visit was expressed by 
representatives of several civic initiatives today. They 
established the Czech Republic's committee of the European 
Campaign Against Racism, Nationalism, Xenophobia and 
Intolerance, the committee's press release said. 
  Pinochet is responsible for "thousands of ruined lives," 
said 
the press release, signed by representatives of the Movement for 
Civic Freedoms and Tolerance, European Human Rights Foundation 
and other human rights organisations.

  [Text] Prague May 31 (CTK) -- The arms trading company 
Omnipol has opened negotiations with the Chilean military 
delegation headed by the former dictator Augusto Pinochet, 
currently chief of Chilean ground forces, Antonin Tomecek from 
the Omnipol Secretariat told CTK today. Pinochet left the Forum 
hotel, where he is staying, this morning shortly before 8:00 
a.m. [0600 GMT]. The negotiations at which leading Omnipol 
representatives are present are taking place outside Prague, 
Tomecek said. 
  Chilean Ambassador to Prague Rolando Byrgin Stein said he 
and 
Pinochet met when Pinochet arrived in Prague yesterday. Stein 
said it was unlikely that they would meet again before Pinochet 
leaves Prague, adding that he had no information about 
Pinochet's schedule.

  [Text] Prague May 31 (CTK) -- The Czech Army does not as 
yet have any official contacts with Chile as regards possible 
cooperation, Defence Minister Antonin Baudys told CTK today. He 
said that with its security in mind, the Czech Republic had to 
cooperate not only with its neighbours, but with countries where 
possible cooperation was of both a military and industrial 
nature, such as Israel, China and other countries. 
  The Czech Defence Ministry had as yet not even considered 
the 
thought of possible cooperation with Chile, he said, adding that 
it was not planning to meet with former dictator Augusto 
Pinochet, now head of the Chilean ground forces, who arrived in 
Prague yesterday. Baudys stressed that the visit was private. 
Baudys was unable to say if the Czech Republic had exported any 
arms to Chile since 1989.

  [Text] Prague, May 26 (CTK) -- Price dumping is 
unacceptable to the Czech Government, and to accuse the Czech 
Republic of such a thing is absurd, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus 
said after yesterday's cabinet meeting, in connection with the 
anti-dumping procedures initiated by the European Union against 
nine Czech cement producers. The whole affair is an example of 
what is bad in trade relations between the European Union and 
the Czech Republic, Klaus said. 
  Trade barriers are a problem for the Czech Republic, which 
would welcome the abolition of duties before 2001, the deadline 
set by the association agreement, he continued. The 
anti-dumping procedures were initiated on March 28 against 
Slovak and Polish as well as Czech producers. The European 
Commission, at the request of the German Association of Cement 
Producers, opened an investigation similar to a trial, in which 
the accused are represented by lawyers.

  [Text] Prague May 30 (CTK) -- Czech Deputy Foreign 
Minister Alexandr Vondra and Chairman of the German Bundestag's 
Foreign Committee Hans Stercken met today to discuss European 
framework to Czech-German relations. 
  The valid Czech-German treaty, which forms the basis of 
mutual relations, certainly does not settle everything, but 
supposes that many questions felt by some people as a burden, 
will be solved or "dissolved" in the European framework, Vondra 
said. He stressed that the word "Sudeten German" had not been 
pronounced at all during the one-hour meeting. 
  As for the compensation of the Czech victims of the Nazi 
regime, Vondra said that any dramatic progress in the issue 
could be hardly expected in 1994, the year described in Germany 
as a "superelection" one. 
  He said he believed it was necessary to cultivate 
Czech-German relations and strive for progress feasible and 
acceptable on both sides. Some steps taken recently by the 
Czech Foreign Ministry and those envisaged by the government are 
aimed to support these tasks, Vondra added. As an example he 
gave the humanitarian gesture (financial support) towards the 
Czech citizens affected by the Nazi occupation, which can a 
little bit ease the "artificially raised tension". 
  "It is only necessary that Czech-German relations are good, 
and that nobody expects what cannot be expected in the nearest 
future, and that the relations are not somehow impaired due to 
the excessive and sometimes also unfeasible expectations," 
Vondra stated. 
  Stercken said the Czech Republic should have a clear idea of 
what it could do to ensure its interests, including those in 
relation to the European Union (EU). He said he accepted it 
with understanding that the Czech Government had not yet applied 
for EU membership, as everybody knew that the time would come 
when the Czech Republic would meet conditions for admission. 
  He would be glad, he said, if Germany became the fourth 
country to ratify the agreement on the Czech Republic's 
association with the EU. Bundestag should do so in the nearest 
future. Stercken said he favoured "gradual association".

  [Text] Prague, May 27 (CTK) -- An agreement to facilitate 
customs clearance in the road, railway, and water transport 
between the Czech Republic and Germany has still not been 
concluded due to the German demand that Czech border communities 
bear their pre-war Sudeten German names in the agreement as well 
as the Czech ones, Miroslav Karnik from the Customs General 
Directorate, confirmed to CTK today. 
  RUDE PRAVO, the left-orientated Czech daily, reported today 
that the fact that the Germans did not want to recognize 
agreements concluded between the former Czechoslovakia and East 
Germany was another problem preventing an agreement from being 
signed. 
  Once these things were clarified and the agreement is signed 
it would be no problem for a Czech expert commission to agree 
with the Germans on everything that should be done to simplify 
customs clearance on the joint border, the paper wrote. 
  Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik said on Thursday [26 May] 
that 
the absence of the agreement was the main cause of the 
kilometers- long lines of lorries forming daily at border 
crossings. He described the German demand that Czech villages 
also bear German names as a key obstacle hampering the 
conclusion of the agreement.

  [Text] Prague May 31 (CTK) -- Russia will pay off $3.5 
billion in debt to the Czech Republic by 2003, Czech Deputy 
Finance Minister Vladimir Rudlovcak told reporters today. He 
said it was agreed last night in a meeting with visiting Russian 
First Deputy Finance Minister Andrey Vavilov. An agreement on 
the debt settlement is expected to be signed within three weeks 
after the Czech Government discussion, Rudlovcak said. 
  In agreement with the methods of the Paris Club of 
creditors, 
both sides agreed on the postponement of payments of the main 
part of the debt worth $1.8 billion until 1999 with regular 
half-year payments until 2003. The payment of the government 
credit at a value of $1.3 billion, the second major part of the 
debt, will begin in 1996, Rudlovcak said. 
  Money owed to Czech enterprises amounting to $330 million 
and 
another $32 million related to the 1991 trade will be paid off 
in a form of goods in the period of 1994 to 1995, Rudlovcak 
said. He said the Czech side was interested in paying these 
sums through oil and natural gas supplies, but Russia opposed to 
it. However, it pledged to send in goods worth $50 million in 
the "foreseeable future" to cover part of these amounts, 
Rudlovcak added. 
  If the $362 million were not paid off by goods until 1995 
the 
two sides agreed on annual up to $70 million payments in 1996 
and 1997, Rudlovcak said. 
  He did not rule out the possibility of capitalisation of 
part 
of the debt, but said that no specific agreement had as yet been 
concluded in this respect. The debt capitalisation would lead 
to more intensive contacts between Russian and Czech 
enterprises, which is desirable, Rudlovcak said.

  [Excerpts] Kozlany, West Bohemia, May 29 (CTK) -- The Benes 
Decrees, ordering the expulsion of the Sudeten German population 
after World War Two, can on no account be revised, President 
Vaclav Havel said here today. The political position of the 
Czech Republic on the question was completely clear, he told 
journalists in the village where Edvard Benes, Czechoslovak 
president in 1935-38 and 1945-48, was born 110 years ago 
yesterday. Revising the decrees would mean revising the entire 
post-war situation, he said. "The decrees were a reflection of 
the time," and their study is a matter for historians, he said. 
  In a speech today to mark the annivesary of the birth of 
this 
key figure in Czechoslovak history, Havel said Benes's merits, 
"though overshadowed by his dilemmas, defeats and problematic 
acts, are unquestionable". 
  "He was a great man who made a worthy contribution to our 
state; he was a figure whom history at times placed before great 
dilemmas," he said. Coming to terms with Benes's acts meant 
coming to terms with the cruelties of history, he said. [passage 
omitted] 
  The 110th anniversary of Benes's birth is being celebrated 
in 
a time when his life's work can be analysed and evaluated 
"freely, objectively (and) publicly," Havel said. His life "not 
only dramatically reflects the fate of the Czech nation, but 
also exposes some of the fundamental and urgent questions of our 
modern existence as a state and the basic dilemmas of politics," 
Havel said. 
  Havel also laid flowers at the bust of Edvard Benes and the 
memorial plaque at his house of birth, and opened an exhibition 
of Benes's life in the village school. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prague, May 25 (CTK) -- At its meeting today, the 
Czech Government approved a bill on the Czech security services 
and a bill on the activity of the Security and Information 
Service (BIS) and on the position and obligations of its 
members. Both bills were drafted on the basis of the principles 
which were thoroughly discussed by parliament. 
  Premier Vaclav Klaus told journalists after the meeting that 
the bill on security services defines the basic framework of 
their activity and basic forms of coordination between them and 
additionally states the way the services are to be made 
accountable. In this sense it is an umbrella law of global 
nature and serves as a basis for another law on the BIS, Klaus 
said. 
  He confirmed that the government had agreed with a proposal 
by its Legislative Council that BIS installations are guarded by 
policemen and not by counter-intelligence members. 
  Klaus described as a considerable positive shift the fact 
that, apart from general control, the new law would make 
security services less accountable to parliament and more to the 
government. To entrust a security service with a task was 
basically a matter of the government and president, with the 
president entrusting security services with tasks through the 
government, Klaus said.

  [Text] Prague, May 26 (CTK) -- The main government 
coalition party, the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), supports the 
strict application of the lustration law and believes that any 
doubts about its violation should be checked, ODS Deputy 
Chairman Jiri Vlach said at a press conference today. 
  He was reacting to claims that the lustration (screening) 
law 
had been violated in the case of two high-ranking officers of 
the Czech Army. The allegation was made by an ODS member of 
parliament Tomas Fejfar, deputy chairman of the Parliamentary 
Defense and Security Committee on the Nova television station on 
May 24. He said Defense Minister Antonin Baudys had admitted 
the fact to him. 
  The newspaper RUDE PRAVO then speculated the following day 
the men in question were Karel Pezl, former Czech Army chief of 
staff and now military adviser to Baudys, and Colonel Rostislav 
Kotil who commands the South Sector of the UNPROFOR [United 
Nations Protection Force] peace keeping unit in Croatia. 
  Vlach said today that Fejfar's claims should be properly 
investigated. 
  Baudys told reporters today that both Pezl and Kotil met all 
the requirements of the lustration law as stipulated in Interior 
Ministry documents. 
  Under the Lustration Law of October 1991 persons who held 
senior posts in the Communist Party, the paramilitary militia or 
the StB [State Security] secret police in the former regime are 
debarred from holding state functions for five years. 
  Colonel Kotil told CTK today that he was considering suing 
those who reported he had received a positive lustration 
certificate (proving his collaboration).

  [Text] Prague May 30 (CTK) -- The difference in the number 
of inhabitants per constituency for senatorial elections must 
not exceed 15 percent, the government coalition parties' 
commission agreed today, Josef Jezek (independent) told CTK. 
Jezek is working in the commission as observer. He said the 
commission accepted the original proposal from the Interior 
Ministry because new division would take long. 
  The elections to the Senate, the not-yet established upper 
chamber of the Czech parliament, will take place probably in the 
autumn, along with local elections. The commission will now 
have to define a mechanism according to which the order of 
individual constituencies will be determined, Jezek said. 
  The order of constituencies, to be stated in a supplement to 
the law on parliamentary elections, will be decisive in 
determining in which constituencies the senator will be elected 
for two, four or six years in the first senatorial election. 
The Senate is to have 81 deputies, one third of which will be 
alternated every two years. 
  Jezek said the final version of the list would be known 
tomorrow, the first day of the 19th session of the Chamber of 
Deputies of the parliament, which will deal with the bill on 
parliamentary elections. 
  The bill sent to the chamber by Premier Vaclav Klaus (Civic 
Democratic Party, ODS) provides for a change in constituencies 
if the number of inhabitants of a constituency increases or 
decreases by 27 percent above or below the average number per 
mandate. 
  In discussions on the authenticity of the bill some 
deputies, 
including coalition ones, pointed out that the document approved 
originally by the government mentioned a 15 percent difference 
which better corresponds to the equal right to vote as embedded 
in the Constitution.

  [Text] Budapest, 31 May (MTI) -- Chairman of the Hungarian 
Socialist Party (MSZP) Gyula Horn on Tuesday [31 May] confirmed 
that his party -- which won an overall majority of 54.1 percent 
in the Hungarian parliamentary elections -- seeks to form a 
coalition government, as it believes the new government should 
reflect the will of the people. 
  Speaking on the breakfast television program "Nap TV" this 
morning, Horn said the Socialists consider the Alliance of Free 
Democrats (SZDSZ) -- which is the second largest party in the 
new Parliament, with 18.1 percent of the vote -- as their most 
likely coalition partner, as the SZDSZ's economic manifesto is 
closest to that of the socialists. 
  Horn added: "Yes, we do want a coalition. However, if this 
does not come about, if there is no partner for this, or if the 
chosen partner is afraid to accept the responsibility of 
coalition governing -- as this does not merely imply velvet 
ministerial chairs, but a very strong responsibility as well, 
and the Free Democrats are just as familiar with the country's 
situation as we are -- then we shall utilize the confidence 
conferred on us by the voters. We received an absolute majority 
from the voters. If there is no other way, then the Hungarian 
Socialist Party will form a government on its own. We would 
like to avoid this, but if there is no other way then we cannot 
let the voters down, we cannot hand back the confidence given 
us." 
  The Socialists will decided on the possible party or parties 
with which they shall begin coalition talks at their special 
congress this Saturday. The Free Democrats are to decide about 
participation in coalition talks at their special delegate 
assembly this Sunday [5 June]. 
  Horn said that for their part, the Socialists could begin 
coalition talks with the Free Democrats as early as next Monday 
[6 June], in order to conclude these talks by the end of June 
and for the new government to be formed as soon as possible, as 
it faces urgent, monumental tasks.

  [Text] Budapest, May 29 (MTI) -- Hungarian Prime Minister 
Peter Boross said that in spite of all the difficulties and 
uncertainties, the organizing of the Hungarian parliamentary 
elections proceeded far better than the European standard. The 
prime minister made the remark on Sunday evening, during his 
visit to the National Election Centre. 
  Attending the session of the National Election Committee, 
Boross expressed satisfaction that the work of the Interior 
Ministry, which he formerly headed, played a decisive role. In 
his view, the country was characterized by a moderate 
tranquility during the elections. 
  Leaving the session, the prime minister answered questions 
from journalists. He said that although he regards it as 
unpleasant, he would not be overly disappointed if his party 
does indeed win only 34 mandates, as was indicated by the public 
opinion poll issued in the evening hours. For him the true 
disappointment was the first round (in which the Hungarian 
Socialist Party won 32.96 per cent of the votes cast for party 
lists, while the senior party of the current government 
coalition, the Hungarian Democratic Forum, received 11.73 per 
cent.) 
  In answer to a question on how effective a small-sized 
opposition can be in Parliament, Boross said that everything 
will depend on the readiness shown by the winning party. Up to 
now, many promises have been made which express a desire to keep 
in contact with the opposition.

  [Text] Budapest, 30 May (MTI) -- "The Hungarian Democratic 
Forum (MDF) must admit that it has suffered a defeat in the 1994 
parliamentary elections," MDF Chairman Lajos Fur told a news 
conference tonight. "Although the defeat was bigger than 
expected, the MDF cannot be wiped out of Hungary's political map 
because it was supported by 600,000 voters," he said. "The Forum 
prepares for its new role as a constructive opposition, keeping 
the interests of the country and the entire Hungarian people in 
view and unwilling to make a surrender of its principles and 
ideals," the MDF chairman said. Fur expressed the conviction 
that his party would return to power in four years. Prime 
Minister and MDF Deputy Chairman Peter Boross congratulated the 
MSZP and its chairman Gyula Horn. "Although it is not yet clear 
what kind of government will be formed, I think the chance of a 
governing coalition is smaller than it was before the second 
round," Boross said. "The victorious party faces four difficult 
years because it must come up to the expectations which brought 
a victory for it," he said. "The MDF should accept the outcome 
of the elections, and draw the conclusions," Boross said.

  [Text] Budapest, 30 May (MTI) -- The Monday [30 May] 
edition of every Hungarian national daily gave extensive 
coverage to the second round of parliamentary elections on 
Sunday [29 May], reporting that the Hungarian Socialist Party 
(MSZP) won an absolute majority in the new Parliament (54.15 
percent of mandates according to unofficial results), with the 
Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) in second place with 18.13 
percent. 
  The newspapers note that the ruling Hungarian Democratic 
Forum (MDF), with merely 9.59 percent of seats, will be now in 
opposition. 
  Commentators give much attention to chances for Socialists 
and Free Democrats forming a coalition, which would ensure them 
a two- thirds majority. Several papers quote leading Socialist 
politicians as saying that the MSZP plans a coalition government 
and regards the Free Democrats as its natural ally. 
  NEPSZABADSAG says that large voter turnout at the elections 
indicated the stability of Hungary's democratic system. 
  That so many voters placed their confidence in the Hungarian 
Socialist Party (MSZP) and the Alliance of Free Democrats 
(SZDSZ) is also important as a clear signal that the tasks lying 
ahead for Hungary can only be accomplished by a government with 
broad mass support. Therefore, what the decisive majority of 
the politicking public wants today can be expressed by one word: 
coalition, says the newspaper. 
  "The unavoidable economic measures can only be taken on a 
very strong political basis. If it is missing, the government 
will seek support to the detriment of rational economic 
management, which would harm the country. The new government 
stands to have a historic, and in all probability one-off, 
chance, which must not end in disappointment. This is also a 
common interest of all parliamentary parties," the commentator 
of NEPSZABADSAG writes. 
  While considering big voter participation an important 
indication of citizens" commitment to democratic elections, the 
daily UJ MAGYARORSZAG is pessimistic about the possible 
implications of a sweeping Socialist win. 
  "Initial unofficial returns showing an excessive Socialist 
victory are disheartening not because of the defeat of 
Christian- conservative forces, but because they foreshadow the 
comeback of the one-party system. It is to be feared that the 
brain trust of the Alliance of Free Democrats will be reluctant 
to enter into a coalition, in which it would have weak 
positions, and it may also happen - according to established 
Eastern European custom - that the Socialist Party will not look 
for partners at all. But this may elicit the SZDSZ's 
resistance, and a really democratic Socialist party will no 
longer be capable of stable government, since one or two 
deputies may as well vote against their own party, and the thin 
majority, shrinking from time to time, will create a new 
political situation. It is also possible that new elections 
will have to be called, which would be a tragedy. We are all in 
the hands of the Socialists. We all are controlling the 
Socialists. As long as we are allowed to do so," reads a 
commentary in UJ MAGYARORSZAG.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 31 -- Poland will endeavour to further 
normalise financial and credit relations with Japan, which 
Poland believes, will activate economic and trade contacts 
between the two countries, Minister for Foreign Economic 
Relations Leslaw Podkanski said Tuesday opening the 15th session 
of economic committees Poland-Japan and Japan-Poland. 
  Addressing representatives of leading industries, trade 
companies and banks of the two countries Podkanski said that 
without a broader opening of Japanese and other foreign markets 
to Polish products and without a larger inflow of foreign 
capital "the final success of Polish reforms may become 
doubtful." 
  The Polish Government will continue to create the best 
possible conditions for the development of foreign trade and 
investments, Podkanski said adding that "stabilisation and 
harmonious economic development in Poland and in this region is 
our priority both in the political, economic and social plane." 
  Japanese Ambassador to Poland Nagao Hyodo said that since 
1990 trade turnover between the two countries have been 
decreasing. Out of 13,000 foreign investments in Poland there 
is only 19 Japanese ones. According to Hyodo, 1994 will see a 
beginning of a new phase of cooperation between Poland and Japan. 
  He recalled the statement of the Japanese minister of 
international trade and industry on the Japanese Government's 
readiness to unblock government guarantees for short-term trade 
and long-term investment credits for Poland, presented at the 
Warsaw east-west conference in May. 
  Makoto Kikegawa, head of the Japanese association for trade 
with Russia and Central and Eastern Europe, claims that the 
decrease of Japanese exports to Poland is due to a diminishing 
demand for consumer goods in Poland, the Polish tariffs, and a 
drop of competitiveness of Japanese goods. 
  According to Japanese experts, a decrease of competitiveness 
of Polish goods and the economic recession in Japan are 
responsible for a drop in Polish exports to Japan.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 26 -- The Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(MSZ) has drawn up four programmes intended to give economic 
support to the implementation of the Polish eastern policy. 
Another two are being prepared, the MSZ told newsmen on 
Thursday. The programmes called "Wokulski," "Partners," 
"Transit," "Contact," "Market," and "Democracy" will be 
implemented and coordinated by a council for eastern policy, 
which is to be established soon. 
  The "Wokulski" project will promote Polish exporters. "We 
want to provide equal opportunities to Polish and western 
investors backed up by investment insuring companies," MSZ 
official Jerzy Kowalczyk said. 
  "Partners" will promote creating equity ties between Poland 
and its eastern neighbours. The project also provides for 
establishing a data bank of investment information and an 
assistance fund supporting Polish businessmen. 
  Under the "Transit" programme, Poland will be able to use 
its 
geographical position by opening duty-free zones, providing 
banking services and acting as intermediary in business with the 
east. 
  "Contact" has been designed to support contacts between 
people at all levels, including the signing of visa-free 
traffic, readmission, border crossing development, the youth 
exchange and the promotion of polish culture in the east. 
  Some of the projects have already been discussed by Polish 
and Russian foreign affairs ministers, Andrzej Olechowski and 
Andrey Kozyrev and according to Jakub Wolasiewicz, director of 
the Ministry's Europa II Department, "ninety per cent of the 
proposals have been accepted" by Kozyrev.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 29 -- The third congress of the 
All-Poland Alliance of Trade-Unions (OPZZ) which ended on Sunday 
re-elected Ewa Spychalska the OPZZ chairwoman for a four-year 
term. During a three-day debate the congress stressed the need 
to be independent and define its place in the coalition of 
groupings forming the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD). One of 
the seventeen resolutions adopted by the third congress 
recommended that the union deputies circle be set up within the 
SLD caucus. 
  Spychalska said in her address that the union is not going 
to 
"unfold any umbrella over any government." Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak, who was the congress guest on Saturday said, 
commenting Spychalska's statement, that "I am glad the 
government will not be under the umbrella, we will have to be 
careful so that we are not out of the frying pan into the fire." 
  He added that the government will be fulfilling the 
coalition 
promises and another revaluation of pensions and retirement 
benefits will be carried out in June. 
  Another congress guest Grzegorz Kolodko, the deputy PM 
[prime 
minister] and finance minister presented the government-prepared 
plan of Poland's long-term development, entitled "The Strategy 
for Poland." Kolodko said that when implemented, the programme 
may bring about a 22 per cent growth of gross national product 
(GNP) within four years and a 15 per cent growth of consumption 
in real terms. 
  Commenting on Ewa Spychalska's statement that "the OPZZ does 
not have any obligations to the Social Democracy of the Republic 
of Poland (SDRP), Aleksander Kwasniewski, the SDRP leader said 
that none of his statements about the OPZZ suggested unilateral 
obligations of the alliance towards the SDRP. "We have mutual 
obligations because we participated in the (September 19) 
elections together," Kwasniewski argued. 
  In adopted resolutions, the congress delegates demanded a 
100 
per cent revaluation of pensions and retirement benefits, based 
on the average wages' growth. They also demanded that 
government take immediate measures aimed at solving the crisis 
in housing construction. 
  The congress protested against "the hitherto passive policy" 
of the government in fighting unemployment. 
  Spychalska told newsmen after the conclusion of the congress 
that the OPZZ authorities are considering whether to sign 
contracts with political parties in order to be able to withdraw 
union deputies from parliamentary work as their union activities 
are restricted closely as if they were "in a corset". 
  Spychalska also stressed the need to strengthen the trade 
union movement in the private sector. 
  Alfred Miodowicz, the first OPZZ chairman has been chosen 
head of the committee for the preparation of the celebrations 
marking the tenth anniversary of the organisation's activity.

  [Text] Bratislava May 30 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Jozef 
Moravcik said today he expected the Hungarian socialists of 
Gyula Horn, who have won the parliamentary elections, to pursue 
a pragmatic policy, which could produce a relatively quick 
settlement of pending problems between Bratislava and Budapest. 
Moravcik met Horn during his visit to Bratislava before the 
elections. 
  Nevertheless Moravcik, who was optimistic about chances of a 
Slovak-Hungarian dialogue when he came to power in mid-March, 
said he did not expect a basic inter-state treaty to be 
concluded before the parliamentary elections which will end his 
cabinet's term. Early elections are to be held on September 30 
and October 1. 
  "It cannot be expected that the whole process of 
preparation, 
conclusion, signing and ratification of the basic treaty of good 
neighbourly relations could be managed within such a short time 
span. This is technically entirely ruled out, but we can take 
important steps to this effect," Moravcik said. 
  Bratislava hopes the treaty will confirm the existing border 
between Slovakia and Hungary, which were set by international 
conferences following World War One and which have been 
challenged by certain forces in Hungary. 
  Budapest on the other hand hopes for an extension of the 
rights of the Hungarian ethnic minority in Slovakia. Some 
560,000 ethnic Hungarians live Slovakia, constituting about 11 
percent of its total population. 
  The two countries are also facing other pending problems, 
such as the a dispute over the Gabcikovo hydroproject on the 
Danube, discords over the temporary division of the Danube 
waters, non-existence of a readmission agreement and the opening 
of new border crossings which Slovakia conditions by the 
conclusion of the readmission agreement.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 27 (CTK) -- In passing today a law 
enabling ethnic minorities to use Christian names and surnames 
in their original form, the Slovak parliament met one of the 
main demands by the Hungarian minority and the Council of Europe. 
  Seventy-two deputies of the 124 present voted in favor of 
the 
law, 48 were against it, two abstained from the vote and two did 
not vote. Immediately after the passage of the law, deputies 
from the opposition Slovak National Party (SNS) walked out of 
parliament for a symbolic five minutes, in protest against the 
decision. 
  "Although the law does not exactly correspond to our wishes, 
it is in line with them," Arpad Duka Zolyomi, a deputy from the 
ethnic Hungarian Egyutteles movement, told CTK. He welcomed the 
fact that from now on Hungarian women would be allowed to use 
their surnames without the "Slovak" suffix of -ova, and 
Christian names registered in their Slovak forms may be 
rewritten into Hungarian, for example Bela instead of Vojtech. 
  Chairman of the SNS group of deputies Miloslav Kona said 
that 
it was an advantage of Slav languages to be able to clearly 
indicate a feminine surname. "Now I register the effort to wipe 
out this advantage. It is unacceptable," Kona said. "I do not 
think anybody is disqualified for using his (her) surname in 
line with Slovak language rules," he added.

  [Text] Bratislava May 30 (CTK) -- Criticism of the Slovak 
Government by Miklos Duray, one of the Hungarian minority 
leaders, was today rejected by chairman of the Democratic Left 
Party (SDL) Deputies' Club, Milan Ftacnik. 
  "(Ex-Premier Vladimir) Meciar and Duray need each other," 
Ftacnik said, commenting on the Egyutteles chairman's accusation 
this weekend that Jozef Moravcik's government was not fulfilling 
its promises towards the Hungarian parties. The SDL is part of 
the coalition government. 
  Ftacnik denied the "endless speculations about the existence 
of secret agreements" with Hungarian parties which the present 
cabinet had allegedly concluded in return for a promise of 
support from these parties. 
  The undertakings which the Moravcik government made when it 
arose were part of its manifesto, and were being fulfilled, 
Ftacnik said. Proof of this was the passing of the law on 
personal names last week by the Slovak Parliament (which allows 
Hungarians to register their names in the Hungarian form and not 
to use the ending -ova for womens' surnames) and the fact that 
on Wednesday [1 June] the "signpost law" on the bilingual names 
of towns and villages is to be passed. Other issues which the 
coalition government had promised to solve by the end of its 
temporary term were being worked on, Ftacnik said. 
  However, at the weekend Duray had accused the government of 
hesitation over the promised approval of the European charter of 
local autonomies and minority languages. 
  Ftacnik countered today that the government had only 
undertaken to create conditions for the future implementation of 
these norms. "The agreement did not read 'approve' but 'create 
conditions for'. It is unreasonable to tie a future government 
to models with which it would not necessarily agree," he said. 
  On another demand of the Hungarian minority leaders, that a 
law be passed on the transfer of property with no known 
restituent into the ownership of the community, Ftacnik 
commented that it was "at first sight sympathetic and 
democratic," but that there could be no debate on it without the 
consequences of such a law first being analysed.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 26 (CTK) -- At today's meeting with 
Slovak President Michal Kovac, Czech President Vaclav Havel 
pointed out the restrained Czech attitude to Slovak politics, 
Havel told journalists. 
  "It would be unwise if the Czech card is played during the 
coming election campaign," he said, referring to allegations of 
Slovak federalism. 
  In the Czech Republic or Slovakia there are no serious 
forces 
wishing for the restoration of Czechoslovakia, Kovac said. 
  The validity of Benes decrees has not been questioned in 
Slovakia, he said. 
  Havel said he was glad Slovakia had joined the border 
regime. 
Border procedures are time-consuming and facilities are on a 
lower level than on the borders with other neighboring 
countries, Kovac said, adding that more finance and better 
administration are needed. "The (Czech and Slovak) Governments 
are aware of the painful situation and will have to resolve it 
promptly," Kovac said. Kovac and Havel are to meet next in 
Prague after the Slovak elections.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 27 (CTK) -- Resuming arms production 
to a "sensible" extent in enterprises affected by conversion to 
civilian production, where "good capacities and possibilities" 
exist, can be seen as useful, Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik said 
today. 
  "Conversion as we were doing it was bad," Moravcik said at a 
briefing after a meeting in Detva of directors of state-owned 
enterprises, bankers and business owners in the central Slovak 
region of Detva. However, he went on, the government has not 
enough money for converting arms manufacturing to civilian 
production to the necessary extent. 
  "We want to release certain funds within several months, but 
this will not be enough to cover all requirements," Moravcik 
added. A possible early resumption of arms manufacturing could 
provide additional funds for speeding up the conversion process, 
he said. 
  The government is currently working out the principles of 
privatization policy in the armament sector, which are to be 
ready by the end of June, said Moravcik. He added that in his 
opinion this sector can be revived through privatization and the 
transfer to private ownership, while maintaining reasonable 
state participation.

  [Text] Zvolen, Central Slovakia (CTK) -- The restrictive 
fiscal policies of the current Slovak Government are necessary 
to ensure a macroeconomic stability which will provide a solid 
basis for future economic development, Slovak Premier Jozef 
Moravcik said today while meeting with administrative officials 
of the Zvolen district. 
  Moravcik indicated that the prerequisites for development 
were a stable budget and a state budget deficit of around four 
percent through increased consumption and value-added taxes. 
  In connection with restrictive policies the government must 
also provide stimulus for development, primarily in the 
construction industry, said Moravcik. Statistics for the first 
quarter show a revival of production, but a drop in investment. 
The government is lacking funds with which to stimulate 
industry because it was forced to transfer them to a judiciary 
system which could neither afford telephones nor essentials for 
its prisoners. 
  Privatization currently offers the only source of funds for 
the government, said Moravcik. Major changes in the 
privatization process will have to be made in order to ensure 
economic development, he said. 
  Reduced budgets for agriculture and defense are unavoidable 
in order to cover budget outlays of eight billion crowns which 
were imprudently planned by the previous government. Moravcik 
indicated that any deepening of the state budget deficit was 
unacceptable, because it would mean "jettisoning good relations 
with international institutions". 
  The premier fears that an unfavorable international 
evaluation would threaten loan negotiations and a deficit would 
spur the growth of inflation. Reduced expenditures and more 
active privatization appear to Moravcik as the most viable 
development path.

  [Text] Bratislava May 30 (CTK) -- Most Slovaks (around 21 
percent) would vote for former Premier Vladimir Meciar's HZDS 
(Movement for a Democratic Slovakia), a poll conducted by the 
independent Focus agency in May revealed. 
  Then HZDS is followed by the Democratic Left Party (SDL) 
with 
12 percent, the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) with 7 
percent, Slovak Workers' Party (SSD, 7 percent) and Premier 
Jozef Moravcik's Democratic Union of Slovakia (DEUS, 6 percent). 
  The rest of the parties would not cross the five-percent 
barrier necessary for entering the parliament. 
  These results somewhat differ from those obtained by the 
Slovak Statistical Office, according to which the HZDS would 
receive 27 percent, the SDL 16 percent, the KDH 11 percent, the 
SSD three percent and the DEUS five percent.

programs for colonization of Kosova, Serbian authorities warned 
that they will give 200 construction sites to the Serbian 
settlers in the Istog commune. The settlers are mainly refugees 
who have fled from Bosnia or Croatia. The sites will be 
delivered in Istog, Dubrave, Muzhevine, Gjurakoc, Banje, and 
other areas. 
  On the other side, the Albanians in the Istog commune has 
been given no construction sites.

  [Text] "The Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi feels 
that the Greek embargo against Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] is irrational and that, as a man 
who puts the economy in the forefront, he can simply not accept 
this as a form of communication with another country," 
Macedonia's Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski emphasized at 
yesterday's press conference, following his visit to Italy. 
Crvenkovski emphasized that Berlusconi had promised that at the 
next EU meeting on Corfu, he would express the Italian stance in 
relation to the Greek embargo, in front of the Greek government 
representatives. 
  The Macedonian Prime Minister expressed satisfaction with 
what Macedonia displayed on a cultural plan within the framework 
of the manifestation "Macedonia in the Honor of St. Cyril," but 
also on a political plan, after the realized contacts with the 
high-ranking officials of Italy and Vatican. 
  Branko Crvenkovski underlined that a particular emphasis in 
the talks was placed on Italy's economic participation in 
Macedonian and the East-West project, which, together with its 
sub-projects, such as the gas line and the traffic route, offers 
possibilities for a joint appearance of construction workers 
from both countries on the Albanian market.
