  [Text] Budapest, 28 June (MTI) -- At its founding session 
on Tuesday [28 June], Hungary's new Parliament elected Dr. 
Zoltan Gal of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) as speaker, 
with a vote of 337 to 16. 
  The deputy speakers, who were also elected by secret ballot, 
are to be Maria Korodi of the Alliance of Free Democrats 
(SZDSZ), Agnes Maczo Nagy of the Independent Smallholders Party 
(FKGP), and Laszlo Salamon of the Hungarian Democratic Forum 
(MDF). 
  Zoltan Gal was born in Budapest on December 10, 1944. He 
received his degree in law at the Budapest University of Arts

Academy in 1981. 
  From 1964 to 1970 he was a member of the trade-union

between 1964 and 1989. He joined the MSZP in 1989 and was 
elected to the party's National Presidium in November 1990. 
  At the first free elections in 1990, Gal entered Parliament

  Agnes Maczo Nagy was born on June 30, 1960. After graduating 
from the law faculty of Budapest University of Arts and 
Sciences, she was a bank administrator, and later, a village

  [Text] Budapest, 27 June, 1994 (MTI-ECONEWS) -- Hungary's 
soon-to-be-established coalition government has declared that it 
must seek new ways of tackling Hungary's economic problems. 
  According to the section of the Coalition Agreement dealing 
with the economy, the continuing dramatic deterioration of the 
country's balance of payment makes it of vital importance that 
the new government avert a general economic collapse, at the 
same time ensuring that Hungary does not fall behind. 
  The Coalition Agreement was approved by congresses of both 
the Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ] at the weekend. 
  The section on economic policy concludes that Hungary faces 
a 
deep crisis, characterized by declining domestic production and 
declining foreign trade, unemployment, a budget deficit, a 
slowing of investment, and a deterioration in competitiveness. 
Although domestic supply is better than in the past, it is 
still insufficient, it says. 
  The fact that the previous government undertook many more 
domestic and foreign obligations than would have been justified 
by the budget situation gives the new government even less room 
for maneuver than originally thought, while the precise extent 
of the obligations is still to be fully established. 
  The first priority will be to publicize a thorough general 
economic inventory, in order that both the government and the 
public may clearly see the situation and realize that there is 
no chance of quick economic growth. 
  A significant amount of purchasing power has appeared in the 
market as a result of campaign-related economic measures, the 
inflationary effect of which can already be felt, the document 
says. 
  The main purpose of the new government's economic policy is 
to establish a market economy dominated by private ownership, 
which would pave the way for economic growth, while at the same 
time bringing down unemployment. This can only be achieved by 
reducing the budget deficit and controlling inflation. 
  The economic policy document gives a detailed discription of 
measures to be taken in order to reorganize the state budget, to 
develop the institutions of market economy, to consolidate and 
privatise banks and state-owned companies, to improve the 
employment situation and industrial performance, to establish a 
general economic foreign strategy, to improve infrastructure and 
enviromental protection, and to prepare for the 1996 EXPO.

  [Text] Budapest, 27 June (MTI-ECONEWS) -- According to the 
Socialist-Free Democrat Coalition Agreement, steps to reform 
public finances must be included in the central budget in 1995. 
  According to the section of the agreement dealing with 
public 
finances, the most important elements of the reform will be the 
itemized investigation of state expenditure, the establishment 
of a central budget that is not based on figures of previous 
years, and cuts in state expenditure. 
  A long-term financing strategy of state debts must be set up 
and the large number of separate state financial funds and 
foundations must be reduced, with some of them to be integrated 
into the central budget. 
  The document plans a law on non-profit activity and on 
public 
procurement as well as the reorganization of the pension and 
health insurance system. 
  The aim of the incoming coalition is to reduce central tax 
payments and to rise local tax payments in the long run. This 
however is feasible only when the economy grows. 
  Steps must be taken towards the establishment of the 
single-tier value added tax [VAT] system with the compensation 
for those in need. VAT refunds on house building must also be 
re-introduced, the agreement says. 
  Consumer taxes must be adjusted to inflation, the supervison 
of levy payment must be strengthened and tax evasion must be 
punished. 
  Investment preferences must be standardized, personal income 
and company taxation must also be included in the 
standardization. According to the agreement, preferences must be 
given to portfolio investments with share purchase. Minimum 
taxation must be abolished. Withholding tax on deposit 
interests must be cut back to zero, and tax after securities 
must be reduced to a minimum in order to decrease interest 
margin, the document says. 
  On the basis of the agreement, a lump-sum tax will be 
imposed 
on small businesses, which can than be controlled more easily. 
The issue of company taxation must be revised, and its amount 
may be reduced in the future in case of economic growth. 
  Regarding personal income taxation, the agreement urges a 
more fair allocation of tax burdens among families, and 
income-related taxation must be introduced in the field of 
pension and other social benefits. It will enable taxpayers to 
use a part of their personal income tax on various public, 
non-political purposes. 
  With the adjustment of duty tariffs to European standards, 
market defensive measures approved by GATT and the European 
Union must be implemented. 
  Another aim of the agreement is to reduce local government 
dependence on the central budget and with this, to decrease 
central re-allocation. As a first step, local authorities will 
be allocated at least 35 percent of the personal income tax 
revenue, instead of the current 30 percent.

  [Text] Opole, June 27 -- Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 
declined on Monday to answer the question on reasons behind the 
dismissals of two deputy finance ministers Henryk Chmielak and 
Wojciech Misiag. "I received the motion on the matter from 
(Finance) Minister (Grzegorz) Kolodko and it is him who should 
be asked," the prime minister told a press conference during his 
visit to Opole province. He added that the two dismissed deputy 
ministers would be able to continue their work in the public 
administration on other important posts, maybe in the economic 
sector. 
  Asked to comment on the decision of the Union of Labour (UP) 
to be in opposition to the present government, Pawlak said this 
changes nothing in parliament. "Every party has its own 
strategy. If the UP had wanted the government to carry out a 
more leftist programme, it should not have withdrawn, but got 
engaged," Waldemar Pawlak observed. The UP accused the ruling 
coalition of shifting its policy towards the right. 
  The prime minister also met on Monday with members of the 
Polish Peasant Party (PSL) in Opole. Pawlak, who is PSL leader, 
asserted the PSL activists that the "Strategy for Poland" 
economic programme for the years 1994-1997 ensures the revival 
of the countryside and its development. 
  The premier did not, however, reveal details of his own 
strategy for the agriculture due to the presence of journalists. 
"The conversation is being controlled. I will speak in general 
then. Our strategy means being present and participate in 
changes in all fields," he said. 
  Earlier in the day, the prime minister opened the Opole 
provincial telecommunications centre. Its inauguration ended 
the first stage of modernising telecommunications network in the 
province carried out under a government contract with the South 
Korean Samsung firm. 
  The contract worth 50 million dollars will make it possible 
to launch 150,000 telephone numbers, in the first two months - 
100,000 numbers. At the moment, the Opole region has the 
smallest number of telephone subscribers. 
  The opening ceremony was also attended by Communications 
Minister Andrzej Zielinski and Korean Ambassador to Poland Chong 
Kae-ok. 
  Also on Monday, Waldemar Pawlak promised governmental 
support 
for building the "South" refinery-petrochemical complex in 
Kedzierzyn- Kozle, Opole province. The talks on this topic with 
foreign contracting parties will start on Tuesday.

  [Text] Budapest, 29 Jun (MTI) -- The July 1993 law on the 
rights of ethnic and national minorities enables Hungary's 
twelve national minorities and its Gypsy community to enter 
their candidates in the local government elections to be held 
this autumn. 
  Of the 10.3 million in Hungary, approximately one million 
people belong to an ethnic or national minority group. The law 
covers those groups which have lived for a minimum of one 
century in Hungary, and have at least 1,000 citizens declaring 
themselves members of a particular minority. 
  Under the law, national and ethnic minorities in Hungary may 
set up their own local bodies of self-administration in 
villages, towns and the districts of Budapest, as well as a 
national body of self- administration, whose members are to be 
elected from local representatives. 
  The size and scope of authority of a local minority 
administration depends on the proportion of minority 
representatives in its locality. If over half of the members in 
a local administration represent a minority, it can be turned 
entirely into a minority government. If at least 30 percent of 
the local representatives come from a minority group, they can 
form their own minority government within the local one, with 
limited authority. If minority representatives make up less than 
30 percent of a local government, the minority government has to 
be elected separately, at the request of at least 100 citizens 
in villages, and of 500 citizens in towns. 
  Minority local administrations may decide on issues that 
directly affect them, and on the allocation of educational and 
cultural subsidies. Their consent is needed for the appointment 
of leaders for local minority institutions. They may start 
businesses, call tenders, grant scholarships, and summon the 
competent authorities in cases affecting minorities. 
  The law also provides for minorities without representatives 
to elect a local minority spokesperson. 
  The local elections due this autumn will be the first to 
include minorities, whose national self-administration body is 
expected to be established before the end of the year. This 
body will make independent decisions on setting up and running 
educational and cultural institutions, and the scheduling of 
minority programmes on radio and television. It will 
participate in the professional supervision of minority 
education and assess legal measures that affect minorities. 
  An ombudsman is expected to be elected in 1994, to represent 
the interests of minorities in Parliament. 
  Of the 12 national minorities, only eight can realize their 
right of self-administration, due to the low density of their 
population in certain localities. Those obtaining this right 
are the Greek, Croatian, German, Romanian, Ruthenian, Serbian, 
Slovak and Slovenian minorities. 
  Of the 600 Hungarian settlements with an option for 
establishing some form of local government for minorities, 200 
wish to set up their own bodies. (In Hungary, there are 3,100 
settlements.) The 220,000-strong German minority, living in over 
400 settlements, intends to form 130 representative bodies; the 
110,000-strong Slovak minority in only 20-30 of the 105 they 
live in; the 70-90,000-strong Croatian community in 10-20 of 
their 50 settlements; the 25-40,000-strong Romanian community in 
5-10 settlements out of their 30-35; the 5,000-strong Serb 
minority in all of its six settlements; the 5,000-strong 
Slovenian population in every one of its seven villages; the 
3,000-strong Ruthenian minority in one or two out of their ten; 
while the 3-5,000-strong Greek community, which is scattered, 
has only one village with enough citizens to form a local body. 
  (All data included in the article were taken from the latest 
assessments of national minority alliances.)

  [Text] Warsaw, June 27 -- Industry Minister Marek Pol 
announced on Monday that he will meet with both Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak and leader of the Union of Labour [UP] Ryszard 
Bugaj later in the week. "I realise that I may have to choose: 
Either remain a minister, or a member of the party," said Pol. 
When asked if one can be a member of an opposition 
parliamentary caucus and a minister at the same time, Pol 
replied: "It is virtually impossible." 
  Pol recalled that he voted against the decision of his party 
to join the opposition to the government coalition and that he 
does not represent any specific political grouping in the 
ministry, but finds himself there due to his experience and 
qualifications. 
  The National Council of the Union of Labour decided on 
Sunday 
to switch over to the ranks of the opposition. The direct cause 
behind the decision was, according to Union of Labour leaders, 
the "Strategy for Poland" economic policy presented by Deputy 
Prime Minister and Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko which in 
their opinion signals a shift to the right in the government's 
policy.

  [Text] Szczecin, June 25 -- The "Solidarity-80" trade union 
split Saturday when the third national congress of the union 
elected Andrzej Dolniak new chairman of "Solidarity-80" National 
Commission. Before the election leader of "Solidarity-80" 
Marian Jurczyk walked out of the congress along with a group of 
several dozen activists connected with him to protest, as he put 
it, against undemocratic solutions of problems, unjustified 
attacks and demands of measures that are not consistent with the 
trade union's statutes. 
  The delegates who did not walk out with Jurczyk resolved 
that 
they constitute a majority and have the right to continue the 
debates. They recalled the National Commission, chaired by 
Jurczyk, and elected the new one with Dolniak as chairman. They 
decided also to move the seat of the "Solidarity-80" authorities 
to Warsaw. 
  Jurczyk, not complying with these decisions, on his part 
announced that the second part of the congress will be held in 
Olsztyn. The congress debating in Swinoujscie, Szczecin 
Province, on Friday and Saturday was to specify new goals of the 
trade union and amend its statutes. From the very beginning it 
was held in the atmosphere of heated disputes.

  [Text] Warsaw, June 28 -- The Freedom Union (UW) has 
forwarded Michal Boni, former labour minister in the Jan 
Krzysztof Bielecki government, as its candidate for the 
president of Warsaw, it was announced on Tuesday. 
  The Warsaw chapter of the Social-Democracy of the Republic 
of 
Poland (SDRP) declared its willingness for talks, but did not 
take a stand on Boni's candidature. The coalition of the 
Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and the Polish Peasant Party 
(PSL) has won 29 out of 85 seats in the Warsaw Council. 
  The SDRP will decide about the UW candidature after it 
learns 
the answer for its conditions presented in the talks the party 
is conducting now. If they are not met, the SDRP threatens it 
will boycott the election of the president of Warsaw who is 
chosen in the presence of at least two thirds of councillors. 
  Warsaw SDRP said that the number of seats won in the local 
government elections obliges the SLD-PSL coaliton to care for 
the city. The party wants to have one third of seats in the 
Warsaw local government assembly. 
  Leader of the Warsaw chapter of the SDRP Andrzej Zelazowski 
said that his party is conducting unofficial talks with 
representatives of other political groups except the right-wing 
parties about eventual coalitions in local government.

  [Text] Warsaw, June 28 -- The Foreign Ministry is 
supporting the fast ratification of the concordat between the 
Vatican and the Republic of Poland, a department director at the 
ministry Janusz Stanczyk said at a press conference organized in 
Warsaw Tuesday before the first reading of the draft 
ratification law to take place in the Sejm on June 30. 
  Stanczyk recalled Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski's 
speech in the Sejm in May on Polish foreign policy, in which the 
minister favoured the fast ratification of the concordat since 
otherwise "Polish relations with the Holy See would enter a 
difficult stage." Stanczyk refused to comment on whether the 
rejection of the concordat by the Sejm would result in the 
recalling of the Polish ambassador to the Vatican. 
  Asked whether it will be possible to negotiate another 
concordat if the present one is rejected Stanczyk said that such 
a possibility exists in legal terms but one cannot be sure if 
the Holy See would be interested in "repeating the uncertain 
procedure". 
  According to Stanczak the government is of the opinion that 
there is no incompatibility between the concordat and the 
constitution so the motion of the Democratic Left Alliance to 
postpone the ratification debate until the new constitution is 
signed is not justified.

  [Text] Warsaw, June 23--Poland and Romania are natural 
partners with similar strategic goals and common security 
interests, Romanian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister 
Teodor Melescanu told a press conference in Warsaw on Friday. 
According to him, both countries may cooperate in economy, 
tourism, communications and on third markets. 
  Speaking about his two-day visit to Poland, Melescanu said 
that it aimed to develop cooperation between the two countries, 
especially between the Polish and Romanian parliaments. He said 
that the Romanian president will visit Poland this autumn. 
Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak has also been invited to 
visit Romania but the date has not been fixed yet. 
  During his visit Melescanu has presented some concrete 
proposals how to boost mutual cooperation. He talked about the 
reconstruction of an old railway route connecting the two 
countries and setting up a Polish-Romanian tourist enterprise. 
Melescanu thinks that such projects could be supported by the 
European Union. 
  Speaking about Romanian debt to Poland now amounting to 50 
million transfer roubles, the Romanian minister said that his 
country will pay it off. He also hoped that any delays will not 
hamper economic cooperation of the two countries which are of 
similar size and which have similar problems. 
  In the morning, the Romanian guest laid flowers at the grave 
of Jozef Beck, Poland's pre-war foreign minister who died during 
the Second World War in Romania.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 24/06/1994 -- While labelling 
the opposition's no-confidence motion as "ungrounded and 
unfair", the president of the Greater Romania Party (PRM) 
Corneliu Vadim Tudor defined the opposition as "a pitiful brake 
against the progress of the Romanian society, a ferment of 
national discord." The definition goes on with describing the 
opposition as "a much too burdensome moral and financial luxury 
for this country." 
  PRM reproaches the presidency, the government and the 
prosecutor general the failure to bring before court the 
dignitaries who in 1990-1992 "plundered the country and now take 
shelter in the clamorous choir of the contentious opposition."

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 27/06/1994 -- "Mr. Nicolae 
Vacaroiu, the prime minister of the Romanian Government, for 
which the opposition has prepared a censure motion due for 
debate today, enjoys our party's confidence, support and 
backing," said Marius Eugen Opran, vice-president of the 
Agrarian Democratic Party of Romania (PDAR), which previously 
was on the government's side but now has associated with the 
opposition on the motion in question. The statement was made in 
an interview for the daily VOCEA ROMANIEI. 
  The PDAR official made a point of saying that, contrary to 
information carried by ADEVARUL and EVENIMENTUL ZILEI, at the 
talks the PDAR delegation had late last week with President 
Iliescu the agrarians defended their own censure motion, which 
partly coincides with that of the opposition, but, agreeing that 
the objective difficulties of the transition period left their 
mark on the general economic standard of this country, insisted 
that the society needed moral and professional purification, not 
only at the top, but also among the next lower ranks. And as a 
possible solution to take this country out of the crisis PDAR 
suggested that Premier Vacaroiu extended in parliament the 
resignation of the present cabinet and then be commissioned to 
form a new government. 
  While stressing that in PDAR's view "Mr. Nicolae Vacaroiu 
represents the best choice for the office of prime minister," 
the agrarian vice-president demands that the premier be allowed 
to select his team by himself, starting of course, from a 
"political grid", and further, each minister have the liberty to 
choose his own second echelon. 
  While in agreement with the opposition on economic matters, 
agriculture mainly, the PDAR does not share the latter's 
determination to impeach the president of the republic, and 
finds "their motivation inconclusive and ungrounded."

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 28/6/1994 -- The Agrarian 
Democratic Party of Romania [PDAR], whose representation in 
Romania's Parliament is ensured by only five parliamentarians, 
has decided to withdraw its support given so far to the ruling 
Party of Social Democracy, told a news conference PDAR leader 
Victor Surdu, on 28 June. 
  Also, he said the Agrarian parliamentarians "will take 
advantage" of the debate of the opposition's no-confidence 
motion in order to present their stand on their own, while 
shunning certain "opinions" of the opposition. The PDAR leader 
said that the no-confidence motion promoted by the Democratic 
Convention ignored certain achievements of the ruling party. 
The PDAR will back it though.

motion against the Vacaroiu Cabinet laid by the Democratic 
Agrarian Party of Romania [PDAR] is "a very big error," said 
Adrian Nastase, executive president of the ruling Party of 
Social Democracy [PDSR], at a press conference on Tuesday [28 
June]. 
  The PSDR leader said that the PDAR Leader Victor Surdu was 
attempting "to draw the electorate of his party onto a certain 
zone in order to justify the PDAR shift to opposition." Anyway, 
the ruling PSDR will treat the PDAR "as an opposition party with 
all the consequences resulting thereof," said Adrian Nastase.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Strategic Affairs Secretary (SAE) Mario 
Cesar Flores on 26 May proposed the resurrection of old security 
and intelligence services -- such as the DSI (Security and 
Intelligence Division) and ASI (Security and Intelligence 
Advisory Office) -- within nonmilitary ministries for the 
purpose of fighting corruption. Flores believes the 
resurrection of these services must be studied carefully so as 
to prevent a recurrence of what happened during the military 
government, that is, the establishment of virtual parallel 
governments within the respective ministries. "It is a good 
preventive measure to have internal intelligence services within 
ministries. Care must be taken, however, to prevent them from 
becoming virtual parallel governments as they did in the past," 
Flores said during a lecture he gave at a seminar entitled: 
Intelligence Activities Within a Democratic State, which is 
being sponsored by the Chamber of Deputies National Defense 
Committee. 
  Flores also proposed the creation of intelligence agencies 
that would temporarily operate abroad -- whenever the need 
arises for obtaining confidential information in other 
countries. Flores said: "Brazil used to have agencies abroad. 
At present, it has none." 
  Upon noting that Brazilian diplomats may obtain public 
information such as that published by the press, Flores noted 
that diplomats should not act as secret agents. He said: 
"Diplomats may supply routine information. But there are cases 
in which diplomats should not get involved because if they are 
caught carrying out secret, illegal activities they end up being 
expelled from the host country." 
  In his lecture, Flores stated that it will be incumbent upon 
the new president to organize the Brazilian intelligence 
service. He said: "In its administrative reform, the future 
government will probably promote a central intelligence 
organization that will be conceived as part of the package of 
organizations answering to the president." In his opinion, the 
new government will have to create a national defense council, 
which will consist of representatives from the Justice Ministry, 
the Foreign Ministry, the Armed Forces General Staff (EMFA), the 
Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the SAE. Flores believes the 
council will be primarily charged with reestablishing 
intelligence activities consistent with a democratic system.

  [Text] Havana, 29 May (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina said pressure and force are not the mechanisms 
to use to leave the country, referring to the more than 100 
Cuban nationals who forced their way into the residence of the 
Belgian ambassador in this capital. 
  Moments before his departure for Cairo, Egypt, Robaina said 
the island's government is holding talks with the Belgian 
Government to find a solution to Saturday's incident but said 
Cuba's position will be the same one it has always maintained. 
  In this regard, Robaina said they must leave the residence, 
because forcing one's way into diplomatic missions "is not the 
way to leave the country, and, therefore, it is up to the 
Belgian authorities, who are aware of the positions we have 
maintained in this regard, to take the proper steps." 
  [Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish at 0101 GMT on 29 May 
transmits an 80-word report, datelined Havana, citing Belgian 
Ambassador Paul Vermeirsch, who today told PRENSA LATINA that 
"he has no comment whatsoever on the forcible entry into his 
residence by a group of people whose objectives had not been 
announced." Vermeirsh added that "any report on today's 
incident in that diplomatic mission would be conveyed by the his 
country's Foreign Ministry in Brussels, the Belgian capital."]

  [Text] Havana, 30 May (PL) -- The Cuban and Belgian 
Governments have concurred on the illegality of the violent 
entrance to the residence of the Belgian ambassador in this 
capital by a group of people on 28 May. 
  Serafin Rodriguez, chief of the Cuban Foreign Relations 
Ministry European Affairs Department, today told PRENSA LATINA 
that this conclusion was reached during the negotiations held by 
the two parties to resolve the situation triggered by those who 
illegally entered the house. 
  Over 100 people have been inside the residence for more than 
40 hours. They are attempting to pressure Belgian diplomats to 
request their departure from the country. 
  Today, Paul Vermkirsch, leader of the Belgian delegation in 
Cuba, who has refused to give statements to the media, went to 
the Foreign Ministry and met with officials from the European 
Affairs Department and from other Foreign Ministry departments. 
  PRENSA LATINA has discovered that in addition to ratifying 
the Cuban position of refusing to accept the use of force 
against foreign delegations in Cuba as a means to leave the 
country, the purpose of the meetings was to reach a common 
position on the illegality of the move. 
  Meanwhile, it was also agreed that once they leave the 
residence, those who want to travel to Belgium, or any other 
nation, must start the official procedures to obtain visas. 
  Rodriguez explained that the Foreign Ministry advised the 
Belgian ambassador that it will not refuse to help the Belgian 
legation acquire supplies needed to take care of the unexpected 
guests. 
  Meanwhile, residents of the Havana neighborhood of Miramar, 
where the Belgian ambassador's residence is located, told PRENSA 
LATINA that early this morning, one person who was inside the 
residence decided to leave and went home without being 
intimidated by local authorities. 
  A discreet police surveillance is under way in the area 
without interrupting the normal movement of vehicles and people, 
as well as the presence of journalists and news photographers in 
the area.

  [Text] Mexico City, 29 May (PL) -- Members of the Mexican 
Let's Go for Cuba solidarity group today held a rally in front 
of the U.S. embassy in Mexico City to protest the U.S. blockade 
against that Caribbean nation. 
  The demonstration, which coincided with U.S. Democratic 
Representative Robert Torricelli's visit to Chiapas, was 
intended to demand the lifting of the more than 30-year-old U.S. 
restrictions against the island which harm the Cuban people. 
  Spokesmen for the solidarity organization reported the 
"interventionist nature" of Torricelli's presence in the 
country, which is intended to harm traditional relations between 
Mexico and Cuba. 
  In this regard, they urged the Mexican Government not to 
forget the traditional policy of friendship that has been 
maintained with the Caribbean nation for years and they stressed 
that "to struggle for Cuba is to struggle for Mexico." 
  Several of the demonstrators protested Torricelli's attitude 
of meddling in Mexico's domestic affairs. Torricelli stated 
recently that with the signing of NAFTA, the United States 
acquired not only the right, but also "the responsibility" of 
evaluating what occurs in Mexico. 
  In a communique released this Sunday, the solidarity group 
also rejected the so-called "Cuban Democracy Act" of 1992 
because the group considers this document to be contrary to 
international law. 
  In this regard, Jose Carrillo, coordinator of the 
organization, told PRENSA LATINA that as part of the strategy of 
support for Cuba, they have presented to the Mexican Congress a 
petition with 13,000 signatures asking for the sale of petroleum 
to Cuba under preferential terms. 
  We also seek, Carrillo added, negotiations to refine Mexican 
crude in Cuban installations because it is a transaction that 
would benefit both countries. 
  Slogans such as "Jump if you are not a Yankee" and jeers 
against Torricelli characterized the rally, which ended with the 
symbolic burning of the law sponsored by the U.S. 
representative. The rally was watched by several U.S. embassy 
officials who refrained from going outside the diplomatic 
mission.

  [Text] Havana, 20 May (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina said that the hemispheric summit convened by 
Washington is a maneuver to discredit, take away authority from, 
and overshadow the results of the Ibero-American forums. 
  Robaina, who yesterday departed for the foreign ministers 
meeting of the nonaligned nations in Cairo, Egypt, indicated 
that the manner in which the Miami summit has been orchestrated 
speaks for itself on what its true goals are. 
  He noted: "That meeting seeks to overshadow what 
Ibero-America has been doing." 
  He criticized the fact that the United States -- the nation 
that has convened the hemispheric forum -- did not consult with 
the nations of the area when it came time to establish the 
summit's topics of discussion, the date, and the site where it 
is to be held. 
  Robaina also considered it negative to "want to talk about 
Cuba when we were specifically excluded, and because of the fact 
the summit is being held in Miami," where the most aggressive 
and right-wing sectors of the Cuban immigrants reside. 
  When questioned about whether Cuba would attend the meeting 
if it were included among the participants, he said "we have no 
fear of attending any forum we are invited to, even in Miami." 
  He explained that Cuba is not seeking an invitation and even 
if it were on the list of participants of that summit, it would 
question the manner in which the summit was convened, and the 
date and the site chosen for the summit. 
  With regard to the IV Ibero-American Summit to be held from 
14-15 June in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, he said that this 
summit's objectives could turn into a true forum for debate and 
economic integration. 
  In terms of the nonaligned nations' meeting, he said that 
Cuba was interested in strengthening this movement "to gain a 
voice and authority that will allow us to debate on the 
international level." 
  When questioned about the goal of his visit to the State of 
Qatar, he said that it was due to an invitation by his colleague 
who had visited Cuba some months ago. Robaina mentioned his 
intention to inaugurate a diplomatic mission in that country.

<F P=106> [By Frank Gonzalez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 26 May (PL) -- Cuban Vice Foreign Minister 
Jorge Bolanos today said his country will attend the 4th 
Ibero-American Summit in order to make that forum a path toward 
integration, especially toward Latin American integration. 
  In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Bolanos explained the 
island's position toward the basic issues that will be discussed 
at the conference on 14 and 15 June in Cartagena de Indias, 
Colombia. He pointed out that Cuba does not have expectations 
that differ from those of previous summits and that Cuba's 
efforts are focused on making this conference a forum to 
introduce formulas and to implement policies and measures to 
achieve Ibero-American integration, especially Latin American 
integration. 
  As he commented on other issues, the deputy foreign minister 
predicted that this important summit will reject the U.S. 
blockade against the island, whose delegation will also seize 
the opportunity to make bilateral contacts with other chiefs of 
state and foreign ministers. 
  Bolanos stressed the importance of the Ibero-American 
summits, which are held, he maintained, without permission from 
anyone, based upon a community that shares cultural roots, 
traditions, interests, and history. He also criticized the 
so-called hemispheric summit, which is promoted by the United 
States and which will be held in December in Miami, because it 
is excluding Cuba. 
  The Cuban official pointed out that the summit has dubious 
origins and objectives, because it is displaying an anti-Cuban 
profile, taking into account the deliberate omission of Cuba, 
the selection of Miami as its theater, and the appointment of a 
U.S. official of Cuban ancestry to make the pertinent 
preparations. 
  He emphasized that it is worth noting that these types of 
exclusive meetings are still being organized at the end of the 
20th century, as we are talking about the end of the Cold War 
and as we are seeing tokens of worldwide compromises and harmony 
at the conferences. 
  Deputy Minister Bolanos also reported the existence of a 
concluding resolution from the 4th Ibero-American Summit. Many 
governments are currently reviewing this resolution. He said he 
will do everything possible for such a document to reflect the 
Ibero-American reality. 
  He added that he is thinking about the living conditions of 
about 210 to 220 million people from the region, people to whom 
we cannot talk about development without social justice, because 
they are living beneath the poverty line.

  [Text] Havana, 27 May (PL) -- Cuban Vice Foreign Minister 
Jorge Bolanos today said the Fourth Ibero-American Summit to be 
held in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, in June, will be more 
dynamic and fluid and less protocol-oriented. 
  In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Bolanos viewed as very 
positive the concept of the summit's program, which will provide 
more room for conversations and debates among the participating 
chiefs of state. 
  He indicated that, in addition to the presidential speeches, 
among the meeting innovations will be a panel chaired by three 
Latin American personalities, whose identities have yet to be 
announced, but who will discuss topics dealing with the flow of 
investments, integration, and the way to finance regional social 
changes. 
  Asked about the importance of the Ibero-American forums, he 
argued that it lies in the desire to meet at Ibero-America's own 
initiative and without an extraterritorial mandate to discuss 
the region's problems and the way to resolve them within a 
spirit of concerted effort, cooperation, and integration. 
  He emphasized that the participation of a socialist Cuba in 
the main meeting of the Ibero-American family reaffirms the 
principle for which Latin America has struggled so much, which 
is respect for the sovereignty of peoples. 
  In this regard, he added that the island's participation 
means a rejection of the policy of exclusion that this nation 
has been a victim of in the past 30 years and that it is a sign 
of the strength of the Cuban process, even in very difficult 
moments and adverse international conditions. 
  In these summits, he added, our country has spoken not only 
for itself, but for the region, defending such concepts as 
development with social justice and the fact that these forums 
cannot ignore the millions of Latin Americans who live in 
conditions below the poverty line. 
  In conclusion, he said the documents of the presidential 
conference must be a reflection of all Latin America not only of 
a part of this geographic region.

  [Text] Washington, 27 May (PL) -- A spectacular judicial 
process could begin today against the U.S. State Department if a 
suit filed to stop the U.S. Government from again denying visas 
to Cuban artists and intellectuals goes through. 
  The suit was filed in November 1993 at the Federal Court in 
San Francisco, California, by the organization Encounter of the 
Popular Song [Encuentro del Canto Popular] in response to the 
government's refusal to grant visas to three members of the 
Cuban musical group Mezcla. 
  According to Bill Martinez, a lawyer and director of the 
organization Latin Action [Accion Latina] that sponsors these 
annual song festivals in San Francisco, the judicial process 
could establish a favorable precedent that will keep President 
William Clinton's government from denying visas to Cuban artists 
and intellectuals. 
  However, this will all depend on whether the judge today 
accepts as valid the viewpoint presented by the State Department 
that has asked for the annulment of the process. "Then, all 
will be finished," Jim Mayock, a member of Encounter of the 
Popular Song, said. 
  "Anyway, we do not know how he (the judge) will react. We 
know that this will be difficult because President Clinton 
handles, at his discretion, the matter of visas for Cubans," 
Mayock added. 
  The Mezcla group musicians had received the approval of the 
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service for their visas, but 
at the last minute, the State Department overruled the approval, 
basing its refusal on Presidential Resolution No. 5377. 
  "This is an arbitrary and inconsistent way of acting... The 
State Department abusively interprets the resolution that was 
implemented in 1985 and which restricts the approval of visas 
for Cubans," Martinez said. 
  The presidential resolution was signed during a period of 
one 
of the worst state of relations between Washington and Havana, 
when former President Ronald Reagan declared that all Cubans are 
government officials and as such were not eligible for visas to 
enter the United States. 
  In March 1994, President Clinton's government denied visas 
to 
two Cuban ballet dancers who had been invited to the Oscar 
presentation in Hollywood. 
  Cuban intellectuals and clergymen invited by Yale 
University, 
as well as Daniel Diaz Torres, a Cuban actor, were also denied 
visas to enter the United States recently.

  [Text] Havana, 28 May (PL) -- An article by Cuban Division 
General Jesus Bermudez Cutino, published today in GRANMA, terms 
a fiction the plans that a U.S. national security directive 
established to save the country's leaders in the event of a 
nuclear war. 
  Bermudez' article, titled "March Over Ashes," refers to the 
so-called Doomsday Project, a product of the Cold War that still 
exists. The project allocates $8 billion to protect the lives 
of high-ranking U.S. leaders in case of a nuclear conflict that 
would practically eliminate all traces of life in the world. 
  The plan involves large columns of armored vehicles crossing 
U.S. territory to avoid Soviet nuclear warheads, establishing 
communications via satellite, and being the only survivors on 
Earth, ruling the world that would reportedly remain, it adds. 
  The plan also includes the creation of several hundred 
special operations commandos to protect the aforementioned 
columns, "which would march with their valuable cargo of leaders 
and `daddy's boys' over the ashes of the very same people who 
had made such a miracle possible with their ingenuous 
contributions," it adds. 
  Later, the article says that, despite the supposed end of 
the 
Cold War, most of this fictitious and diabolical structure still 
prevails, although THE NEW YORK TIMES said it has been canceled. 
  Bermudez said this should become a reality so the resources 
can be used to mitigate the hardships that paradoxically are 
still on the rise in the richest country of the world -- where 
unemployment, social abandonment, vice, and mendicancy increase 
along with economic growth.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive article" by Fausto Triana: "Vietnam-United </F>
States: Life After the Embargo"] 
  [Text] Hanoi -- It was like the touch of a magic wand. On 
3 February, President Bill Clinton put an end to two decades of 
political and trade embargoes against Vietnam. From that moment 
on, the Indochinese country faced a new truth: Washington's 
pressure had been, in effect, devastating. 
  It seemed like a dream, while others saw it as a mere 
formality. Since the beginning of a profound process of economic 
reforms in 1986, the Hanoi government had showed prowess and an 
uncanny ability to maintain the breathing room necessary for its 
survival. 
  Three months after the lifting of Washington's restrictions, 
a spectacular flood of political and trade delegations has been 
arriving weekly to court the so-called "virgin of Southeast 
Asia." 
  It is the end of the international isolation to which 
Vietnam 
was subjected because it dared defeat the United States 
militarily. The Indochinese nation is the best example of this. 
  Suddenly, the business sector is stampeding to conquer a new 
market of 71 million inhabitants with oil, gas, and a wide range 
of natural resources. Businessmen from places such as Taiwan, 
Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and France have made 
advance reservations in anticipation of this moment. 
  It cannot be denied the Vietnamese economic boom went a long 
way by itself without any international help, although it was 
prevented from acquiring high-technology while brushing aside 
the ashes of war. 
  Hanoi's authorities, faithful to the Asian tradition of 
patience, are not acting hastily, and they are not particularly 
anxious. Therefore, some find their cautious reaction to the 
lifting of the blockade to be surprising. 
  Concerning this issue, Le Mai, deputy foreign minister in 
charge of negotiations with Washington in recent years, says the 
Vietnamese people suffered enough during the war against the 
United States. 
  This is, of course, a step forward, which should be followed 
up with the full normalization of relations, but it also serves 
to display the serious damage caused by the United States with 
its economic and trade blockade policy during 20 years, Le Mai 
said. 
  Putting resentment aside, the North American invasion -- now 
employing the weapons of trade -- has encountered a predictable 
reality: Those who were here in defiance of the embargo have 
better knowledge of the market and, now with the White House's 
consent, have quickly strengthened their positions. 
  There is enough room for everyone, however. Vietnam -- the 
third-ranked rice exporter in the world, the fourth-ranked oil 
producer in Asia, and a nation with a single digit inflation 
rate and 7 percent average growth over the past three years -- 
urgently needs to improve its infrastructure. 
  Dr. Nguyen Mai, vice president of the State Committee for 
Cooperation and Inmvestments (CECI), told PRENSA LATINA there 
will be no preferential treatment for any nation. He said: 
Logically, an atmosphere of mutual trust is created as a result 
of the work experience, but our goal is to license projects to 
real specialists. We want to introduce specialists who possess a 
high level of training and technology into our country based on 
mutual benefit. 
  Advisers of the U.S. Business and Assistance Council in 
Asia recently visited Hanoi and estimated that during the next 
two years, U.S. investments in Vietnam could reach $2.6 billion. 
  The trend is moving toward reaching agreements and obtaining 
licenses in fields such as oil, gas, telecommunications, 
industrial generators, transportation, road building, computers, 
and consumer goods, says Maureen Flanagan, honorary chairman of 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Asia. In her opinion, her 
country's investments will jump to $8 billion within five years, 
at which time she expects fluid trade. 
  Noted local economist Le Dang Doang, however, warned that as 
long as Vietnam does not receive most favored nation (MFN) 
status in trade with the United States, the possibilities of 
purchasing U.S. goods are limited. 
  A reduction of tariffs is imperative to position our 
products 
in the United States and to have the cash to compete with China 
or Thailand, two countries awarded MFN status, Doang pointed out. 
  Right now we would like to purchase Boeing airplanes, but if 
we sell textiles to the United States, it would be at a very low 
price. At any rate, we will have to wait for the normalization 
of relations, he added. 
  The first important agreement between Hanoi and the United 
States, following the end of the embargo, was reached two months 
ago. Vietnam will export 100,000 tons of rice to the United 
States. 
  Influential media such as NEWSWEEK, THE NEW YORK TIMES, and 
the CNN television network have predicted that liaison offices 
will soon open in Hanoi and Washington, and it is almost certain 
that embassies will be opened in mid-1995. 
  Diplomats residing in the Vietnamese capital generally agree 
with this assessment, although they foresee certain obstacles on 
the road to reestablishing bilateral ties. 
  The resolution of the MIA-POW issue has advanced notably in 
the wake of close cooperation between Pentagon experts and 
Vietnam's Defense Ministry. Even though there are more than 
2,000 MIA-POW's and 300,000 Vietnamese files, the search for the 
remains of the missing is becoming increasingly successful. 
  The avalanche of U.S. tourists has become noticeable since 
the beginning of 1994. The majority of these tourists will help 
to definitely heal the wounds of the conflict, but certain other 
people have tried to spoil this atmosphere, a Foreign Ministry 
official who asked to remain anonymous stressed. The human 
rights issue is going to play the main role in this effort, and, 
in terms of this issue, Vietnam has answered the United States 
the same way some of her Asian neighbors have replied. 
"Discussions on the issue must be based on mutual respect, 
independence, sovereignty, and in keeping with the cultural 
traditions of each country." 
  Today, life in Vietnam, if not completely untroubled, is 
entering a stage of accelerated growth in what was once the 
Cinderella of Southeast Asia. If conclusions can be reached, 
here are two: The U.S. embargo was devastating, but the 
persistence and valor of the Vietnamese people have won the 
other war -- the economic war.

  [Text] Havana, 27 May (PL) -- U.S. activists will 
participate in a demonstration in front of the White House and 
the Congress in Washington to support an anti-blockade bill 
proposed by Representative Charles Rangel, PRENSA LATINA learned 
today. 
  The demonstration, which will include more than 4,000 
people, 
will be staged on 9 June, Raymundo del Toro, of the 
Cuban-American Peace Committee, reported by telephone from New 
Jersey. 
  Del Toro told this agency that they expect the participation 
of clergymen, friends of Cuba, and Cubans residing in this 
country, who will also send letters to the Capitol and call the 
White House to demand an end to the economic measures. 
  The participants, he added, will pay for their own 
transportation to Washington to support Rangel's bill, which has 
been debated in several committees of the House of 
Representatives since 17 March as a free trade initiative. 
  The fate of Rangel's initiative, which is supported by more 
than 30 congressmen, is expected to be known by 9 June, Del Toro 
pointed out. 
  The demonstration, he said, is promoted by various 
organizations such as the Cuban Information Project, the 
so-called International Peace for Cuba [Internacional Paz para 
Cuba], the Pastors for Peace Motorcade, the House of the 
Americas, and the Cuban American Committee of Washington, among 
others. 
  In the United States there are currently more than 62 
organizations affiliated with a national network of solidarity 
with Cuba, which has organized several actions to oppose the 
blockade that has cost the island $40 billion since 1962. 
  The growing movement of solidarity with Cuba has resulted in 
three motorcades carrying humanitarian aid, construction 
brigades, and actions to defy a ban on travel to Cuba by U.S. 
citizens, among other activities.

  [Text] Havana, 30 May (PL) -- Upon his arrival here today, 
Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban parliament, highlighted 
the British policy of continuing and developing ties with Cuba 
and of disagreement with the U.S. blockade on the island. 
  After concluding a five-day visit of the United Kingdom, 
upon 
invitation by the British Interparliamentary Union, Alarcon 
maintained that in debates in the House of Commons, conservative 
and government representatives as well, expressed their will to 
increase bilateral relations between Cuba and the United Kingdom. 
  He also referred to the British disagreement on the blockade 
on Cuba when announcing the visit of British Commerce Minister 
Patrick Mcloughlin [title and name as received] in September. 
Alarcon met in London with Betty Boothroyd, speaker of the 
House of Commons, among other officials. 
  Alarcon headed a delegation made up of Osvaldo Martines, 
president of the parliament's Economic Commission, Deputy Lidia 
Tablada, director of the National Center for Agricultural 
Health, and Ramon Cepero, secretary general of the Health 
Workers' Union.

Colombia, Jesus Martinez, affirmed today that Colombia is 
engaged in an international opening process and that in this 
context it is giving important consideration to its relations 
with Cuba. 
  The Cuban diplomat told PRENSA LATINA that Cuba's ties with 
Colombia, renewed in October 1993, are very positive and 
intense, especially in the cultural, commercial, and 
bilateral-cooperation fields. 
  He explained that the two sides have the will to strengthen 
relations and that his country also gives priority to its 
relations with Colombia. 
  When asked about the celebration of the fourth 
Ibero-American 
summit in the Colombian city of Cartagena de Indias on 14 and 15 
June, the ambassador said that the Colombian authorities view 
that summit as the most important international meeting of the 
past few years. 
  Ambassador Martinez said that the fact that there were no 
high level meetings before the summit is very positive for this 
fourth Ibero-American summit. 
  He said that this Colombian initiative was viewed positively 
by the Ibero-American family. He noted that the idea is aimed 
at making possible more intense discussions among the chiefs of 
state in the context of the summit. 
  Regarding violence in Colombian streets, the ambassador said 
that the local Colombian authorities have said they will adopt 
strict security measures to prevent incidents that would mar the 
image the government wants to enhance. 
  He noted: That country is interested in demonstrating that 
violence and drug trafficking are not Colombia's most 
outstanding features, that since the adoption of the new 
Constitution there is a new Colombia, very different from what 
it was in the past. 
  The ambassador added: Colombia has always worked intensively 
in the framework of international organizations, but it is 
evident that during the government of President Cesar Gaviria 
there has been a will to intensify those efforts. 
  In the ambassador's opinion, the celebration of elections in 
Colombia this weekend will have no negative effect on the course 
of the presidential summit, which has been held in Mexico, 
Spain, and Brazil in the past.

  [Text] Havana, 18 May (PL) -- The visit of Gloria, the 
Colombian flagship, will serve to reaffirm, even further, the 
ties of friendship and brotherhood between Cuba and Colombia. 
This was said today here by Captain Eduardo A. Otero, the 
vessel's commander. 
  The Gloria was met today at the Cuban Revolutionary Navy 
(MRG) pier by Captain Martin Jodar, representative of that 
institution's chief and of its chief of staff, and by Ricardo 
Santamaria, Colombian ambassador to Cuba. 
  Otero told a group of reporters who were visiting the 
sailing 
vessel that he was pleased by the warm reception he was given 
upon his arrival in this capital and noted that this presence 
here will serve for the crew and the cadets to learn about the 
island's reality. 
  I am very enthusiastic because during my first visit to Cuba 
in 1976 in this same vessel, I travelled as an officer aboard 
and today as ship commander. This will allow me to contribute 
to the strengthening of the relations between our two nations, 
he stressed. 
  Otero and the officers who accompanied him were received by 
Rear Admiral Pedro Perez Betancourt, MRG chief. Perez 
Betancourt expressed Army General Raul Castro's, chief of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces, satisfaction with the arrival of 
Colombian Navy training vessel. 
  The vessel, a 23-sail brigantine, will remain at the Havana 
pier until 21 May when it will depart for Norfolk, Virginia, the 
United States. 
  The Gloria, which has been the Colombian Navy's flagship for 
25 years, embarks annually on tours while it serves as a school 
for the Colombian naval cadets. Among its goals are the 
development of the cadets' and officers' love for the sea, the 
naval mystique, as well as dedication to those values, the 
members of the crew pointed out to PRENSA LATINA. 
  Moreover, the Gloria's mission is to serve as a goodwill 
ambassador that takes to all the world's ports of call 
Colombia's friendly facet, through its floating expositions and 
through the conduct of each crew member, the same sources added. 
  The 40 officers, 73 cadets, and 13 civilians embarked on the 
tour will engage in a program of simultaneous visits to Havana's 
historical center -- patrimony of humanity -- the museum of the 
revolution, a naval academy, and the biotechnical institute. 
They will also hold conversations with young Cuban cadets with 
whom they will exchange experiences and academic knowledge as 
well as on the life in their respective nations. 
  The Colombian Navy flagship is also scheduled to visit the 
United States, France, Portugal, the UK, Germany, and Spain in 
1994.

  [Text] Havana, 28 May (PL) -- Cali and Santa Clara, 
important cities in Colombia and Cuba, signed a protocol to make 
them sister cities as a contribution to the intensification of 
the bilateral cooperation that is taking place between both 
countries. 
  The information was revealed today during a modest ceremony 
to bid farewell to the Cuban delegation that will leave for 
Colombia tomorrow to implement the agreement to link the capital 
of Valle del Cauca Department and the city located in the 
central part of the island. 
  The Cubans will also participate in the sessions of the 
world 
meeting of mayors of healthy cities convened by Colombia, which 
will be attended by some 100 mayors from various countries of 
the world between 1 and 4 June. 
  The purpose of the meeting will be to exchange experiences 
regarding primary health care. The invitation sent to Cuba is 
based on the progress attained by the country in that field. 
  The Cuban delegation includes Humberto Rodriguez Gonzalez, 
president of the People's Government (mayor) of Santa Clara, and 
Jose Luis Garcia, rector of the Central University of Las 
Villas, both deputies and members of the Central Committee of 
the Cuban Communist Party (PCC). Another member of the 
delegation traveling to Cali is Marcelino Rodriguez Tejeda, 
director of the important mechanical industry plant in Santa 
Clara and also a member of the PCC Central Committee. 
  Colombian ambassador to Cuba, Ricardo Santamaria, who was 
present at the ceremony, said the movement to twin the cities of 
both countries will contribute to the intensification of 
bilateral cooperation in the areas of trade, economy, and 
culture. 
  Santamaria said one of the fundamental objectives is the 
mutual learning of the productive, cultural, and social 
activities of both cities. He added that, later on, a Cali 
delegation will visit Santa Clara, which will facilitate the 
identification of areas of cooperation. 
  Through this symbolism of city twinning, there are great 
efforts made to strengthen bilateral relations because the 
future visits of Cali officials to Cuba will include a 
delegation of businessmen interested in specific projects. 
  The diplomat also talked about the important increase in the 
balance of trade between the two countries during the last four 
months as recognized in the latest report by the Colombian 
foreign trade authorities. He also recognized the work done by 
Jesus Martinez Beato, the Cuban ambassador in Santa Fe de Bogota. 
  Moreover, Rodriguez Gonzalez said this direct exchange will 
facilitate the strengthening of the Latin American integration 
movement. He mentioned the bilateral cooperation possibilities 
to which the industrial potential that exists in Santa Clara can 
also contribute. 
  University rector Garcia Cuevas talked about the recognized 
level of the institutions of higher learning in Valle del Cauca 
Department and predicted the achievement of a higher qualitative 
level in the exchanges that have already taken place with El 
Valle University and other institutions. 
  The movement to twin the cities of Cuba and Colombia began 
with the twinning of Santiago de Cuba and Cartagena. It will 
continue with the one between Cali and Santa Clara, and there 
are plans to continue with the twinning of Barranquilla and 
Matanzas. 
  Likewise there is an interest in twinning Cienfuegos and 
Medellin, Varadero and Santa Marta, the island of San Andres 
with the western Isle of Youth in Cuba.

<F P=106> [Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish at 2311 GMT on 26 May </F>
transmits a service message killing this item] 
  [Text] Caracas, 26 May (PL) -- Former Venezuelan President 
Carlos Andres Perez was expelled today by the Democratic Action 
Party (AD) in what is considered a blow more severe for the 
former president than his own incarceration. 
  The National Directorate Council (CDN) of the social 
democratic organization of which Perez is one of the founding 
leaders made the decision in a meeting that began with violent 
incidents in which one participant was injured. 
  The party organization, comprised of 289 members and 
delegates, thus ratified a statement issued and adopted by the 
National Executive Council [CEN] on 19 May, a day after Perez' 
incarceration. He is charged with misappropriation and 
embezzlement of secret funds in 1989. 
  In statements to the media prior to the session, the former 
president, one of AD's founding leaders, attributed his 
expulsion to a minority of party leaders and asserted: "No one 
will be able to expel me from AD members' hearts." 
  When the forum began, a group comprised primarily of young 
leaders who support the former president angrily protested the 
exclusion of one of their members from the list of CDN 
participants. This resulted in a squabble during which chairs 
were thrown. 
  The proposal was presented by Secretary General Luis Alfaro 
Ucero, who controls the party machinery, and it was opposed by 
the members of the so-called renewal groups within the 
organization, led by former presidential candidate Claudio 
Fermin. 
  Spokesmen of that faction insist that the rank and file do 
not support the measure, adding that this goes beyond the "Perez 
case" because Alfaro Ucero's actions are directed against 
Fermin's plans to run for secretary general. This would pave 
the way within the organization for leaders shaped by the former 
president. These people demand that the party's internal 
elections, scheduled for November, be held immediately.

  [Text] Havana, 27 May (PL) -- At the end of two days of 
talks that also included the topics of trade and economic 
cooperation, Cuba and Spain signed today an Agreement for the 
Protection of Reciprocal Investments. 
  Ernesto Melendez, Cuban minister of Economic Cooperation and 
Foreign Investment [title as received], and Apolonio Ruiz 
Ligero, Spanish secretary of state for Commerce and Tourism, 
signed the document and the records of the 4th Meeting of the 
Mixed Cuban-Spanish Commission in the presence of Vice President 
Carlos Lage and Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas. 
  Following speeches in which Melendez and Ruiz voiced great 
satisfaction about the results of the negotiations, the Spanish 
secretary of state told the press that Spain maintains a line of 
credit granted to Cuba in the amount of $40 million. 
  Apolonio Ruiz said he trusts that trade with Cuba will 
increase as a result of the agreements that have been signed and 
the Cuban Government's measures that promote an increase in 
internal demands through tourism and the people having an access 
to convertible currency. He added that trade between the two 
countries will also increase in the long run through an increase 
in Cuban domestic production. 
  Bilateral exchange declined in 1993 to $290 million, but the 
high-ranking Spanish official hopes it will increase this year. 
The 5th Meeting of the Mixed Cuban-Spanish Commission will be 
held in Madrid in 1995.

<F P=106> [By Silvio Mendiandua] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 27 May (PL) -- The most noteworthy results 
of a visit by Ecuadoran deputies that ended today were the 
pledge to increase solidarity with Cuba and the prospect of 
broadening exchange of experiences. 
  The multiparty delegation that was in Cuba between 22 and 27 
May was headed by Professor Juan Jose Castelo, president of the 
education, culture, and sports commission of the single-chamber 
parliament, and made up by Secretary Abdon Monroe Palacio, 
Gilberto Vaca, Osvaldo Coronel, and Magaly Robalino. 
  Castelo, who spoke on behalf of the South American deputies 
in an interview with Jaime Crombet, acting president of the 
National Assembly of the People's Government (Parliament), 
expressed his satisfaction at the fruitful exchanges with their 
Cuban colleagues. 
  The visitors, aside from seeing the National Assembly and 
other official departments, visited hospitals, institutions for 
infants, and educational, scientific, and cultural centers. 
They spoke to directors and workers. 
  During a two-hour conversation with Crombet, the deputies 
expressed their admiration for the Cuban people's efforts to 
overcome the severe economic difficulties following the collapse 
of the European Socialist Bloc -- Cuba's historic ally -- and in 
the face of Washington's increased economic blockade. 
  Castelo underscored that this struggle is carried out 
without 
impairing Cuban independence and sovereignty, or without 
affecting achievements in health, education, and social 
security, which deserve support and solidarity. 
  Castelo, as president of an important commission comprising 
10 percent of the total number of Ecuadoran parliament deputies, 
spoke about Ecuador's interest in participating in the Pedagogia 
95 congress that will be held in Havana in February 1995. 
  Castelo also believes that the fluid dialogue that began 
should continue together with broadening the parliamentary 
visitor exchange program so that both countries can take 
advantage of their experiences for the benefit of their 
political and economic processes. 
  In reply to PRENSA LATINA, Castelo, in his role as national 
leader of the Democratic People's Movement (MPD), disclosed that 
this force, the number one leftist force, will promote electoral 
unity in order to win the 1996 elections and multiply solidarity 
with the Cuban revolutionary process.

<F P=106> ["Cuba Is Interested in Increased Italian Investments, </F>
Trade, and Tourism" -- PRENSA LATINA headline] 
  [Text] Rome, 25 May (PL) -- Cuba's new ambassador to Italy, 
Mario Rodriguez, affirmed today in this capital that his country 
is interested in increased Italian investments, commerce, and 
tourism. 
  During a news conference on the occasion of presenting his 
credentials to Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, the Cuban 
diplomat said that his mission is to make known and to earn 
respect for the situation in his fatherland through a ready 
dialogue with the local authorities. 
  Commenting on his meeting with the Italian president, 
Rodriguez said that he was pleasantly impressed by the attention 
Scalfaro pays to and the knowledge he has of Cuba and Latin 
America. 
  In explaining the absence of conflicts in bilateral 
relations 
between the two countries, the ambassador said that annually 
Cuba receives 70,000 tourists from Italy, the island's fourth 
most important source of tourists, after Canada, Mexico, and 
Spain. 
  Regarding investments, Rodriguez explained that one of every 
10 Cubans is either a technician or a professional, something 
that represents a guarantee to any nation, and that investors 
have legal guarantees that they can export their profits. 
  Cuba is heading for an economy capable of allowing the 
island 
to see through a political project that has been obstructed for 
35 years by a relentless U.S. economic blockade. 
  It is absurd to see, he said, how at the end of the century 
and after the occurrence of many international changes that 
produced political, geopolitical, and economic mutations, the 
embargo not only is being maintained, it is also being 
encouraged. 
  Until his designation as ambassador to Italy, Mario 
Rodriguez 
was vice minister of foreign relations and before that, from 
1986 to 1990, he headed the Cuban diplomatic mission in Prague.

  [Text] Geneva, 25 May (PL) -- Cuba today described as 
unacceptable the link being sought here between the UN Security 
Council and the Human Rights Commission, indicating that it is 
up to the Rwandan people to find a solution to the dramatic 
conflict. 
  The Cuban position was expressed by Ambassador Jose Perez 
Novoa, who explained that his country will not break the 
consensus for a special session on the Rwandan situation to 
adopt a resolution whose concepts Cuba rejects. 
  For Cuba, it is extremely essential that there be a 
cease-fire, a dialogue and negotiation among all the parties, 
support for the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and its 
member states, as well as the full application of the peace 
agreements signed in Arusha, Tanzania, in 1993. 
  The Cuban Government, the diplomat stressed, believes that 
the Rwandan people are the ones who must find a solution to this 
dramatic and unfortunate conflict. 
  If the Rwandan parties do not decide to end the 
confrontation 
and seek a negotiated solution to their common problems and 
differences, Perez Novoa said, we will be sad witnesses of the 
continuation of hostilities, as has been occurring in other 
conflicts addressed in special sessions by this same commission. 
  Without mentioning it, he referred to the situation of 
former 
Yugoslavia, which was discussed in two special sessions of the 
Human Rights Commission in 1992. 
  In his opinion, the text that was presented created a new 
dilemma for the participants: approving it to declare themselves 
against extremely grave violations of human rights would mean 
acceptance of the imposition of concepts that distort the 
functions and mandates conferred by the UN Charter to its 
various bodies. 
  This, he stressed, sets a totally negative precedent for the 
functioning of the bodies of the UN system. 
  However, he added, by rejecting them, one would turn one's 
back and remain silent about so dramatic a situation which 
affects the rights and lives of thousands of human beings. 
  Without a doubt, we cannot refrain from expressing an 
opinion 
on the Rwandan events, but neither can we endorse concepts that 
Cuba has systematically opposed and that some countries are 
trying to impose by taking advantage of such serious situations, 
the ambassador added. 
  He stated that the linkage that is being sought by the 
Security Council is totally unacceptable, as is the inclusion of 
concepts relative to preventive diplomacy and the eventual 
establishment of an international tribunal, which in addition, 
he said, is under discussion. 
  In tacit reference to the situation in the former 
Yugoslavia, 
he indicated that it is not a matter of using the same 
prescription for different illnesses. Prescriptions which, in 
addition, he said, have been unsuccessful in the cases in which 
they have been applied. [sentence as received] 
  Considering the seriousness of the events in Rwanda and the 
feelings of the African peoples, Cuba did not hinder the 
approval of the resolution, even though it contained concepts 
that Cuba believes to be unacceptable and which, if submitted to 
a vote, it would have expressed opposition to.

  [Text] Havana, 28 May (PL) -- The Cuban Office of the 
Prosecutor General has opened files on more than 150 people, 
whose possession of wealth is believed to have come about 
illegally. This is being done in accordance with the recently 
implemented decree-law 149. 
  PRENSA LATINA learned from sources at the Office of the 
Prosecutor General that these proceedings were initiated after 
more than 60 homes and 200 vehicles, including cars, trucks, and 
motorcycles, as well as vehicle spare parts and accessories, 
were seized. 
  Similar action was taken with many motors, household 
appliances, clothing, machinery, accessories, raw materials, 
plastic products, tanks containing fuel, tanks filled with 
oxygen and acetylene, and exorbitant amounts of grain and animal 
feed. 
  Meanwhile, GRANMA reported that factory, store, small 
business, and restaurant administrators, as well as farmers, 
mechanics, and electricians are among those who have acquired 
wealth illegally. The article adds that large sums of money, in 
cash and in bank accounts, were also seized from these people. 
  One of the biggest files belongs to a resident of the 
western 
Pinar del Rio Province, who will have to prove legal ownership 
of two cars, two motorcycles, two rice mills, one corn mill, and 
a large number of spare parts and accessories, as well as a 
large amount of oxygen and acetylene. This individual was 
hoarding many pieces of fake jewelry, more than 250,000 pesos 
(the same as $250,000 at the official exchange rate) in bank 
accounts and cash, motors, and food. 
  In all these cases, including those in which it is obvious 
that illegal activities were committed, those involved will be 
given time to prove that the goods were acquired legally. If 
the accused cannot prove this, the file will be sent to the 
State Committee for Finance and the State Committee for Prices 
to decide whether or not the goods will be seized. 
  This operation against the so-called hoarders is being 
conducted in response to requests made by the people during the 
more than 80,000 meetings at places of work, in accordance with 
an agreement approved by the parliament and with the decree-law 
passed by the government.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Ricardo Alarcon, president of the </F>
National Assembly of the People's Government, by PRENSA LATINA 
correspondent Javier Rodriguez; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Havana -- An extensive conversation with Ricardo 
Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the People's 
Government [ANPP] (parliament) of Cuba, gives us the opportunity 
to look into the reality of the operations at this unique 
organization, which plays an ever more important role in the 
country's day-to-day political life. 
  The issue can be stated simply: How does the island's 
congressional apparatus work? Apart from the formal tasks an 
entity such as this must carry out, it has other special 
characteristics, as a consequence of the political system the 
Cubans have adopted. 
  Addressing this issue inspired both interviewee and 
interviewer, especially when one takes into account that 
Alarcon, who expresses himself with ease, has an accumulation of 
experience as a diplomat, a negotiator for his country in 
difficult international situations, and a representative at the 
United Nations. 
  He is now one of the main players in what could be called 
the 
modernization and recognition of the special role the Caribbean 
nation's legislative body plays in such an exceptional moment in 
its history. On this, Alarcon outlined the following 
conclusions: 
  In a modern world and for the first time, only socialism can 
offer us the opportunity of executing and examining how to 
exercise the authority of the people, within the characteristics 
of a more complex society. 
  He adds: 
  The only way to do this is to develop a system, with new 
formulas every day -- an infinite multiplication of the 
parliament -- in an effort to enhance the relevance of direct 
democracy. 
  In referring to the ideas of a celebrated Austrian author, 
Alarcon cites the theory of making society a part of the 
legislative body, as an effective way of involving every citizen 
of a nation in the decisionmaking processes, which concern 
precisely them. 
  The way to reach this essential level of participation is to 
expand the assembly's activity through collective and continuous 
discussion, everywhere, and not by annulling it. There is, he 
adds, very recent proof of this theory in the parliaments of the 
workplace. These assemblies studied the viability of the latest 
measures taken to cleanse the economy. 
  More than 80,000 meetings at an equal number of workplaces 
across the nation took place during the last few months in Cuba. 
Workers in the areas of production and services, as well as the 
members of student, peasant, and women's associations, discussed 
the current national economic situation. 
  Alarcon explains that the national, provincial, and 
municipal 
deputies participated in these meetings. This allowed them to 
come to the extraordinary session of the ANPP with an impressive 
amount of information about the people's opinions regarding such 
important issues. 
  The deputies came to the assembly after having spent many 
more hours examining the issues in question than any other 
deputy on the face of the earth has ever dedicated to any issue. 
Furthermore, millions of people participated in the meetings 
and debated something that in other countries is never brought 
before the people at all. 
  For our interviewee the key to this whole matter is to 
develop this concept of democracy. This, in the end, will make 
the people true participants; a subject of society and not just 
a passive object, who is only invited to participate in the 
process every once in a while to put a ballot in a ballot box. 
  In one part of the conversation, Alarcon pauses and 
strongly criticizes the so-called Western representative 
democracies, which he described as true democratic fiction, 
removed from the people's interests. 
  The tendency among the population of the countries with that 
system is electoral shyness characterized by not voting because 
it increasingly makes less sense to do so. You can count on the 
fingers of one hand the times an elected candidate meets with 
those who voted for him so as to be held accountable before 
them, he said. 
  Regarding his country, Alarcon said it has the possibility 
of 
playing out a true democratic ideal in a society based on human 
solidarity and equality, improving the mechanisms for the 
effective participation of its citizens. 
  It is impossible to gather all 11 million Cubans at the same 
time, but it is possible to do it throughout a process, a 
difficult mechanism, which requires a dose of creativity and 
originality. The process preceded the decisions made by our 
assembly regarding the strengthening of the national finances. 
  The method used to implement these types of things is 
already 
being practiced in the ANPP's daily work, in its various 
entities, including the permanent commissions, and Alarcon 
explains it by listing specific examples. 
  As for the education budget problem, the education 
commission 
did not limit itself to giving its opinions and to approving the 
proposals made by the corresponding ministry, but practically 
visited all schools in the country, closely observing existing 
problems and providing solutions to them. 
  The services commission paid special attention to matters 
related to the tourism industry, which is being completely 
expanded in the country, and to self-employment, including 
existing regulations and their observance. 
  The defense commission did its work based on the observance 
of the guidelines of the struggle against crime, currently of 
great interest to the entire population, as well as based on the 
implementation of Revolutionary Armed Forces Ministry 
instructions for the decrease of budget expenditures on the 
military. 
  The supervision of the food program, in a programmed and 
continuous manner, is also part of the work of the parliamentary 
commission members, who review the situation during visits to 
production centers and participate in the analysis made by the 
Agriculture Ministry. 
  Another important example is that of the legal and 
constitutional affairs commission, which is currently working on 
the discussion of a citizenship law, for which it is collecting 
opinions, not only among the appropriate organizations but even 
with representatives of Cubans living abroad. 
  The work carried out by the commissions has an interesting 
ingredient since they were created because each one of the 
commissions has representatives of all Cuban provinces, which 
gives a national vision to the statements and agreements 
submitted to the ANPP plenum. 
  An important part of the current work has to do with the 
process initiated on the control and supervision on the use of 
the national budget at the various levels, the results of which 
have been a series of ideas and initiatives aimed at reducing 
expenditures and increasing state revenues. 
  According to Alarcon, this activity must contribute to the 
strengthening of the country's finances and the elimination of 
the budget deficit, an effort carried out with a dose of 
creativity by the municipal and provincial assemblies of the 
People's Government. 
  The representativeness claimed by other systems is only 
fictitious, and we hope that in Cuba, we can increasingly 
develop the exercise of a true and direct democracy, the ANPP 
president concluded.

  [Text] Havana, 27 May (PL) -- The second council of the 
Cuban Tourism Ministry is meeting today at the Convention Palace 
in this capital to examine projects for this summer, Tourism 
Minister Osmany Cienfuegos told PRENSA LATINA. 
  All activities of this recently created ministry are under 
discussion, added Cienfuegos, who is also deputy chief of 
government. He underscored the holding of this meeting days 
after the conclusion of Cuba '94, the 15th International Tourism 
Convention, at the Varadero Beach Resort. 
  Cuba wants to boost the so-called smokeless industry and 
plans to attract 1 million visitors in 1995. 
  The names of new Cuban tourism businesses were presented 
only 
a week ago at Varadero. These businesses include three hotel 
chains, namely the Gran Caribe, Horizonte Hotels, and Islazul, 
and also the Marina Puertosol. 
  The meeting of the tourism ministry council involved 
managers 
and presidents of the main tourism institutions and companies 
that are preparing to assume the challenge of competing in a 
world market, in which Cuba has a strong appeal, in the opinion 
of the meeting participants.

  [Text] Havana, 26 May (PL) -- The Cuban weekly GRANMA 
INTERNATIONAL will be published in German for distribution in 
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and The Netherlands to inform 
tourists from those countries who visit the island, the 
newspaper's directors announced here today. 
  GRANMA INTERNATIONAL editorial director Gabriel Molina said, 
at a ceremony during which Edition Zero in German was presented, 
that the event was a day for celebration because a dream has 
come true after four years of hard work. 
  GRANMA's first issue of its monthly edition to 
German-speaking European countries is dedicated to Cuba's 
struggle to maintain its sovereignty and the achievements of its 
revolution despite the disappearance of the Socialist Bloc and 
the intensification of Washington's blockade. 
  Molina noted that the German edition of GRANMA 
INTERNATIONAL, 
the first Latin American publication in that language, will at 
first be issued monthly. Once it is consolidated, it will 
become a weekly publication as are the Spanish, English, French, 
and Portuguese editions. 
  GRANMA was initially published in three foreign languages on 
15 February 1966, later in Portuguese, and now in German. 
  It now it circulates in 76 countries. For the past two years 
it has been printed in Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil. The 
German edition will be printed in Luxembourg so that it will 
reach readers faster. 
  Including the copies printed in various countries, GRANMA's 
publishes over 70,000 copies.

  [Text] Havana, 30 May (PL) -- The president of the 
Federation of University Students [FEU], Otto Rivero, confirmed 
today that the approximately 8,000 students who will graduate 
this year from Cuba's universities have job guarantees despite 
Cuba's adverse economic situation. 
  Rivero said the conclusion of the school year is less than 
45 
days away and already 7,000 graduating university seniors have 
been informed where they will have a job. There are ongoing 
talks with authorities to determine where the rest will work. 
Rivero said a great effort is being made to guarantee jobs for 
all graduating students. 
  Cuba is enduring severe economic difficulties following the 
loss of its main foreign markets as a result of the 
disappearance of the socialist camp in Europe and of the Soviet 
Union and as a result also of the tightened economic blockade 
imposed on Cuba by the United States more than three decades ago.

  [Text] Havana, 28 May (PL) -- The National Directorate of 
the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR), the 
largest people's organization in Cuba, today called on the 
population to support the measures adopted to cleanse the 
national economy and increase surveillance against crime. 
  Sixto Batista Santana, national CDR coordinator, called on 
CDR members to contribute to achieving an understanding for and 
to support the measures, so as to overcome the economic 
difficulties that have appeared following the collapse of the 
socialist bloc and the worsening of Washington's blockade. 
  The main leader of the CDR, created 33 years ago, presided 
over the second meeting of the CDR National Directorate in which 
surveillance by CDR members in every block of the country was 
analyzed as an important factor to prevent crime, according to a 
wire item reported today by the National Information Agency. 
  At the meeting, it was agreed to recognize the work of 
prominent CDR members in performing their tasks and the mission 
of explaining to the population the new financial provisions, 
the source indicated. The Council of State decreed an increase 
in the price of some products, such as cigarettes, beer, rum, 
and such services as electricity and urban transportation, as 
well as general payment for water service. 
  During the semester from October 1993 to March of this year, 
CDR members from all over the country contributed 243,068 
voluntary blood donations, donated over 11 million crystal 
containers, 8,000 tons of paper and carton, and 2,587 tons of 
aluminum, in a contribution they make each year to public health 
and the national economy.

<F P=106> [By Walfredo Angulo] </F>
  [Excerpts] Havana, 28 May (PL) -- Only 72 hours before the 
beginning of the hurricane season in Cuba, an exercise called 
Meteor 94 has begun throughout the country aimed at implementing 
the various mechanisms needed to confront the forces of nature 
that could hit the island. 
  It is believed that hundreds of thousands of people 
throughout the island will participate in this exercise, which 
is based on the UN plan to prevent catastrophes. [passage 
omitted] 
  The goal of this exercise is to prepare the people and civil 
defense organizations for floods, earthquakes, heavy rains, and 
hurricanes. During the Meteor 94 exercise, the islanders will 
pretend to be bracing for and confronting a very big hurricane. 
  The Cuban specialists have justified this exercise with 
numbers. In the past 200 years, the island has been hit by 90 
hurricanes that have resulted in many dead and wounded and heavy 
material damage. [passage omitted] 
  During the exercise the people will pretend to be bracing 
for 
a hurricane that has been baptized "Claudy." This hurricane 
will follow the same trajectory followed by "Gilbert," a 
hurricane that hit Cuba, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, 
Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula 
in 1988. [passage omitted] 
  Meteor 94 is designed to alert people to this type of 
catastrophe and update civil defense mechanisms, as well as to 
establish the role of the media in such a situation. The goal 
is to create a safer world as the year 2000 approaches.

  [Text] Havana, 27 May (PL) -- Brigades of workers from 
various Cuban state agencies engaged today in arduous relief 
operations in Guantanamo and Santiago de Cuba after heavy rains 
caused considerable damage in these eastern provinces. 
  Both Guantanamo and Santiago de Cuba suffered considerable 
damage in such areas as agriculture, housing, roads, 
communications, and electric power generation because of the 
excess water and mudslides. The latter were the result of 
torrential rains that lasted several days. 
  According to reports by a special ministerial commission 
assigned by the government to promote the resumption of services 
and to assist the victims, Guantanamo has been the hardest-hit 
of the two provinces. 
  In Guantanamo, the roads suffered considerable damage, with 
some 3,000 km of highways and roads affected. As for the 
installations that supply potable water to the population, 
several aqueducts were destroyed and another 12 are presenting 
problems. 
  Over 100,000 people currently lack a regular water supply 
and 
this prompted, together with urgent efforts to reestablish it, 
the Health Ministry to decree a special epidemic prevention 
program and to increase the allowance of medicines and personal 
hygiene articles to people. 
  As for Santiago de Cuba, the work focused mainly on facing 
flood-related losses in nearly 1,500 hectares of sugarcane 
plantations, and facilitating the resumption of the sugarcane 
harvest, already in its last phase. 
  Efforts have also targeted thousands of hectares of 
vegetable 
crops, which were totally or partially flooded because of the 
heavy rains, hundreds of kilometers of roads destroyed, and 
nearly 5,000 houses wrecked.

  [Text] Havana, 28 May (PL) -- A final assessment by Civil 
Defense today indicated that more than 40,000 square km were 
damaged by the recent rains and floods in Cuba's eastern 
provinces. 
  The irregular weather situation from 18 to 25 May caused 
most 
of the damage in Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and Camaguey 
Provinces. Civil Defense reported the total or partial 
destruction of 4,370 houses and damage to another 38,720. 
  A total of 9,000 km of roads and highways, 20 railroad 
bridges, and 18 others located on interurban roads were damaged 
by the waters of overflowed rivers and dams. Approximately 
4,500 square km of fields, mostly planted with sugarcane, rice, 
tubers, and vegetables were flooded. 
  More than 250,000 people were affected, 38,600 of whom were 
evacuated from their homes. Approximately 172,450 farm animals 
were also evacuated. A significant number of dams, microdams, 
aqueducts, and electricity and telephone services were also 
damaged. 
  Civil Defense said that at this time all sectors of the 
economy are analyzing the secondary damages caused by the 
rainfall, although without halting the intense recovery activity 
under the direction of a ministerial commission created for this 
purpose.

  [Text] Havana, 25 May (PL) -- Santiago de Cuba will play 
host to solar and aeolian energy enthusiasts, who will attend an 
international workshop from 20 to 22 June. The meeting is 
sponsored by the Eurosolar organization, UNESCO, and other 
organizations. 
  The workshop was organized by the Cuban Ministry of Science, 
Technology, and the Environment [as received]. Almost 100 
foreign specialists -- mostly Argentines, Mexicans, and Italians 
-- will attend the workshop. The same number of Cuban 
specialists will also attend. 
  Jose M. Oriol, an engineer and president of the organizing 
committee, told PRENSA LATINA that the meeting will include 
conferences and seminars by renowned personalities, such as 
Enrico Turrini, the vice president of the Eurosolar group. 
Turrini will speak about the environment, independence, and 
democracy. 
  Besides the investigative presentations, there will be 
several symposiums and round tables on photo voltage power, 
converting solar energy into heat, solar energy, the 
environment, and solar and aeolian energy architecture; there 
will also be a technological exhibit. 
  Cuba is looking at alternate energy sources to address the 
acute energy crisis it is currently experiencing, after the 
disappearance of the USSR, which was once its main supplier of 
fuel oil. 
  A world conference on biomass energy generation, 
development, 
and the environment will be held in Havana in January of 1995. 
Eurosolar, UNESCO, and the Latin American Energy Organization 
(OLADE), among other organizations interested in promoting 
sustainable energy generation, will sponsor this gathering as 
well.

<F P=106> [Report on 30 May Communique issued by the Zapatist National </F>
Liberation Army General Command on the end of consultations to 
discuss the proposal to reach a peace agreement in Chiapas, by 
reporter Juan Carlos Santoyo and unidentified announcer; from 
the "ACIR Radio News" Newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Santoyo] Pepe, good afternoon to you and the 
audience. I have the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] 
communique in my hands. I will read its six basic points: 
  Brothers of the EZLN's Clandestine Indian Revolutionary 
Committee-General Command, we are contacting you to state the 
following: 
  1. The EZLN has already ended the consultations in all the 
towns that supported it by holding assemblies in the many towns, 
ejidos, rural slums, and hamlets that support and sympathize 
with the EZLN's just cause. Zapatist men, women, children, and 
elders analyzed and discussed the 32 proposals made by the 
federal government and the 34 demands made by the San Cristobal 
Zapatist group. 
  2. The men, women, children, and elders who, in 1993, voted 
to start the war and all those who have joined the EZLN taught 
the country a lesson in liberty and freedom by exercising their 
right to freely choose the EZLN. 
  3. The EZLN also received opinions and comments by all other 
Mexican social sectors. We will take into account the wisdom 
expressed by the suggestions made by our brothers, Indians, 
peasants, workers, students, teachers, housewives, 
nongovernmental organizations, Mexicans living abroad, 
intellectuals, and honest artists. 
  4. As of 31 May 1994, the EZLN is in a state of permanent 
assembly to start counting votes, to analyze the opinions 
received, and to give a reply as the supreme leadership of the 
EZLN's military and civilian forces. 
  5. All access to territories under EZLN control will be 
closed to the national and international media while the 
counting and analyses is in process. The results will be 
released through a communique issued by the supreme leadership. 
  6. The date and place to hold a news conference to inform 
Mexico and the world of EZLN decisions will be given in due time. 
  As usual, Subcommander Marcos signed this communique from 
somewhere in the mountains of the Mexican southeastern region. 
  Thus, the EZLN takes a major step regarding a consultation 
that was expected to reach a prompt conclusion. We have also 
received reports indicating that Manuel Camacho Solis, 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, might be 
arriving in San Cristobal de las Casas in the coming hours. 
Camacho Solis is expected to issue a communique on the Chiapas 
situation, and especially, to give details of a program he 
discussed with legislators two weeks ago during a meeting. This 
program, which was called aggressive, seeks to provide answers 
to all doubts and demands expressed by the EZLN in regard to the 
San Cristobal agreements. Thus far, this is the situation here 
in San Cristobal de las Casas and gradually, a second dialogue 
seems to be closer to becoming a reality. Many, however, are 
convinced that a second dialogue could not take place very soon, 
but the two conflicting parties are expected to give a concrete 
answer on the steps to follow regarding this peace and 
reconciliation talk. 
  [Announcer] Is this EZLN communique addressed to a specific 
person? 
  [Santoyo] No. It is addressed to the Mexican people, peoples 
and governments worldwide, and the national and the 
international media. It is not addressed to anyone in 
particular. 
  [Announcer] Reports from San Cristobal de las Casas indicate 
that complaints have been made that, precisely, the EZLN has 
been telling the international media that, there are planes and 
helicopters flying over EZLN-controlled territory, just 136 days 
away from the date when this activity will be banned. 
  [Santoyo] That is true. There is a second communique in this 
regard that has been addressed to SEMANARIO NACIONAL, PROCESO, 
LA JORNADA, EL FINANCIERO, and EL TIEMPO. In this communique, 
Subcommander Marcos, the signer, makes a traditional report of 
their current situation in the jungle. Marcos does indicate 
that following the 15 May event, helicopters have been spotted 
in addition to planes. Cooks complain that there will not be 
enough pots if they decide to land at the same time. Marcos 
includes in this communique -- a very long one, some seven pages 
-- a sort of poetic report of everything they are currently 
experiencing in the Lacandon jungle. He basically says that the 
consultations are over. The communique also includes a part 
addressed directly to the Party of the Democratic Revolution 
[PRD]. This part constitutes a long point and refers to the PRD 
saying a few days ago that more people have died within the PRD 
because of political strife than within the EZLN. Marcos notes 
in this communique that, even if they are right on the fact that 
more people could have died, what is truly significant is that 
currently in this Chiapas location, efforts are being 
implemented to make these peace and reconciliation negotiations 
benefit all Indian and peasant peoples nationwide. 
  Marcos adds that as it is true that people have died, so it 
is that there is sacrifice and bloodshed involved in every 
struggle. They do not say, however, that currently, it is hard 
for the country to assume this sacrifice. There is also another 
section of the communique that says criticism is always welcome 
from pontiff to pontificate. Finally, they will be able to 
accuse us of being untimely; ignoring the correlation between 
forces; practicing political miscalculation; lacking [word 
indistinct] to watch the debate live; lacking subscriptions to 
major newspapers and magazines to learn about post-debate 
evaluations; being unkind and rude; suffering from mountain 
sickness; not recognizing possible allies; being sectarian, 
intransigent, and ill-tempered. We can be accused of 
everything, but not of being consistent. All we have done is 
place a trigger [gatillo] on hope, this communique concludes. 
This communique answers all the criticisms raised within the PRD 
regarding the famous visit made by PRD presidential candidate 
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano. On this occasion, he received 
very blunt criticism from the EZLN, and specifically, from 
Subcommander Marcos. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
correspondent Jacobo Zabludovsky; Peres in English with 
superimposed translation into Spanish; from the "24 Hours" 
newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Zabludovsky] Good evening, Mr. Peres. Thank you 
for granting us this interview. 
  [Peres] Thank you. 
  [Zabludovsky] Mr. Peres, Israel and Mexico have had 
diplomatic relations since 1952. What is the current state of 
these relations? 
  [Peres] Between Mexico and Israel? 
  [Zabludovsky] Yes, please. 
  [Peres] Well, first of all, Mexico has changed considerably. 
It is not the same Mexico since I last visited. I think Mexico 
is in the middle of a change and in the future it will undergo 
greater change. Soon, we will see great economic, social, and 
other changes in Mexico. I have a lot of admiration for all 
that Mexico has achieved and is achieving. 
  Israel has also changed. We went through many wars; we won 
them and now we are waging the greatest war of all, which is the 
war for peace. I am sure that we will win this war as well. 
  We would like to establish cooperation with Mexico in four 
different areas. In the economic area, we would like to have a 
parallel agreement between Mexico and Israel like the one that 
exists between the United States of America and Israel. Second, 
we would like to avoid double taxation. Third, we would like to 
establish scientific and technological cooperation between 
Mexico and Israel. Fourth, and most important from my 
viewpoint, is the need to strengthen our cultural exchanges. 
Mexico, like the rest of Latin America, is a great continent 
for literature, art, painting, and sculpture. In Israel, 
culture is a priority. I think we should bring our respective 
countries' authors and the readers together to have a cultural 
exchange and not only political and economic exchanges. 
  [Zabludovsky] Can you tell us about relations between Israel 
and the Vatican? 
  [Peres] That is really something sensational. For the past 
1,994 years, our relations with the Catholic world have had 
their ups and downs, more downs than ups. For the first time, 
we have reached an understanding that was formulized by the 
Vatican and Israel. In January of this year, we signed an 
agreement to exchange ambassadors. The signing of the agreement 
was done in Jerusalem. It is a dramatic, historic, and 
religious change between two important religions. This is the 
result of a diplomatic event that happens once every 2,000 years 
and I am very glad that it happened this year. I am looking 
forward to a new understanding for tolerance between the 
Christian world and the Jewish world. I have had the pleasure 
to invite the Pope to visit Israel and I understand that he will 
do it in the near future. He told me that the Lord extended his 
life so that he would be able to visit Israel, Jerusalem, and 
the Holy Land. 
  [Zabludovsky] Mr. Peres, you have been one of those who made 
many efforts to attain peace with the PLO. What is currently 
happening in the Middle East? 
  [Peres] I think the Middle East will change like the rest of 
the world. There is a new wind blowing all over the place. 
What is happening today is that the real political strengths 
are neither the political parties, nor the traditional armies, 
nor the influential super powers. The most important force is 
this camera because people, young and old, are waking up every 
morning and seeing what is happening in the world. They ask 
themselves: Why is it that in other countries people can move 
around freely, have a better life, and behave in a civilized 
matter? They ask themselves: What is wrong with our country? 
  For example, I believe that what brought down communism was 
not an army, invasion, or party. What brought communism down 
was information of what was happening in the world. The silver 
curtain became stronger than the iron curtain. The government 
could no longer lie to the people. The same is happening in the 
Middle East. Whatever you see today is what happened yesterday. 
Tomorrow, and perhaps even today, young people, Arab, 
Palestinians, Israeli, Christian, Muslim, and Jew, will try to 
compare their lives with the lives of others and ask: Why 
should we have wars? Why should we waste hundreds of millions 
of dollars on weapons? Why should we support a dictatorship? 
Dictatorships in our days have become so expensive that only 
the rich countries can have dictatorships. The poor people are 
no longer willing to pay for the craziness and egomania of 
dictators. I deeply and sincerely believe that in the near 
future, the next generation will prefer peace, freedom, and 
science. That is the future. 
  [Zabludovsky] What is the future of Jerusalem? 
  [Peres] Jerusalem is politically closed and religiously 
open. 
Throughout history, Jerusalem has never been the capital of Arab 
life. On the other hand, in Jewish life, we have never had 
another capital but Jerusalem. Jerusalem is not only the 
capital of our prayers, but the capital of our existence. So we 
are not going to divide Jerusalem; we are not going to turn 
Jerusalem into a Berlin; we are not going to divide Jerusalem 
and build a wall. It will remain united as the capital of 
Israel. But while politically it is closed, religiously it will 
remain open. Every believer, Christian, Muslim, Jewish, who 
wishes to come and pray to God in his language, in his 
tradition, in his church, mosque, or synagogue, will have the 
right and the opportunity to do so. It will be our 
responsibility to secure his free coming, to secure his free 
worship, to respect his own faith and his own heritage and 
tradition. 
  [Zabludovsky] Were you pleased with the explanation Mr. 
'Arafat gave to the call to a Holy War for Jerusalem? 
  [Peres] No. 'Arafat is using the language of yesterday. It 
is old and dangerous. But when it comes to policies, he made a 
change. So when I judge 'Arafat by his words I feel very bad; 
but when I judge 'Arafat by his decisions, I feel that we must 
continue and provide peace for Palestinians and Israelis. 
  [Zabludovsky] Do you trust 'Arafat? 
  [Peres] Do I talk to him? Oh, my God, day and night. You 
know, in the Middle East you shake hands during the day and you 
negotiate at night. I have forgotten what a morning is like 
because usually the negotiations begin late at night and go 
through the night. There have been many long nights, some of 
them extremely complicated and difficult. 
  [Zabludovsky] Will Israel withdraw its support for Arab 
autonomy? 
  [Peres] I am sorry, I did not get the question. 
  [Zabludovsky] Could Israel suddenly back out of the 
Palestinian autonomy issue? 
  [Peres] Who? 
  [Zabludovsky] Israel. 
  [Peres] No. We made up our minds. In many ways we are 
negotiating with ourselves more than with the Palestinians. The 
reason why we are negotiating -- and we are on the giving side 
and not on the receiving side -- is because we do not want to 
become, or remain, a dominating nation. Jewish history is 4,000 
years old. Never in our lives did we control, govern, or 
dominate other people. The people who tried to dominate us have 
disappeared from history. We do not want to dominate the 
Palestinian people or Palestinian life. We would like to see 
the Palestinians elect their leaders, nominate their judges, 
appoint their police, have the right economy, raise their 
standards of living, and become good neighbors. They will be 
our neighbors and Israel will be their neighbor and neither of 
the two should attempt to impose their will on the other. 
  [Zabludovsky] Can a similar agreement be reached with Syria 
on the Golan Heights? 
  [Peres] It is possible, but, for the time being, President 
al-Asad has not opened up. He is speaking about normalizing 
relations with Israel, but how can he normalize relations with 
Israel if he is not willing to normalize negotiations with 
Israel? We cannot conduct negotiations in a narrow channel full 
of microphones. We negotiate and there is no progress. We 
believe that if al-Asad wants peace then he must do it as it is 
being done at the end of the 20th century. These negotiations 
must be open, conducted at political level and highly 
professional. These negotiations must be conducted with the 
knowledge of the people. The parties meeting in private must do 
so with the knowledge of the people because it is not a 
negotiation between leaders but between peoples. Today, 
everyone is a diplomat and everyone is a judge. We would like 
to see the Israeli people convinced that Mr. al-Asad means 
business. He wants something from us that is tangible, a 
mountain. We want something from him that is not tangible, 
peace. Now peace must be as clear as the mountain is. 
  [Zabludovsky] Mr. Peres, do you think it is possible for 
Israel to live in peace with its neighbors? 
  [Peres] Yes, Israel could and would live in peace with its 
neighbors if the neighbors do likewise. All the things that are 
important today in the lives of the people cannot be attained 
through war. Whatever war can achieve is no longer important. 
In the past 10 years, the Middle East spent a trillion dollars 
in weapons. This money was taken away from the mouths of the 
children; it was taken from their schools and their future. We 
do not have the right to continue doing this. With half that 
money, we would have been able to dramatically change the Middle 
East. I believe more and more Arabs are beginning to see this. 
  [Zabludovsky] Thank you Mr. Peres. 
  [Peres] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report By Rosie Watson Vasquez from the "ACIR Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres met today for 
30 minutes with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari at Los Pinos 
official residence. Peres came with some proposals that are 
already being studied so they can be implemented without delay. 
Those proposals include seeking a commercial agreement -- and 
this is perhaps the most important proposal -- similar to the 
one that has been in effect for some years between Israel and 
the United States. 
  Israel is setting its sights on Mexico because, Peres said, 
it is a nation that seeks markets and opportunities. During 
this private meeting, President Salinas de Gortari and Foreign 
Minister Peres also discussed ways to prevent double taxation 
which is hurting commercial exchange, to seek (?joint 
investments) for development and research in the field of 
science and technology, and to promote cultural exchange. On 
this latter point, it has been suggested that each country 
should select 10 works of literature, translate them into the 
other country's language, and publish them. 
  They also talked about the new structure that must govern 
the 
United Nations now that the division between communism and 
democracy, north and south, no longer exists, so the Third World 
countries can join the First World, Peres said. Following his 
private meeting with the Mexican president, the Israeli foreign 
minister hosted a news conference where he said the 21st century 
is full of perils and nations have to block the path of 
dictators, new wars, and the proliferation of nuclear weapons 
because we do not have much time left. This is the time, 
according to Peres, to buy a ticket for revolution and to 
understand revolution means change. He added, it is a time to be 
either spectators or actors. He felt Mexico had already 
purchased its front row ticket. 
  The Israeli official admitted that change has made the world 
more democratic and that the topic of protecting the ecology and 
living a free life go hand in hand. One advantage to all this 
is the movement of information, which travels in the sky as if 
it were air. Television, for example, is much stronger than the 
iron curtain of the communist system. 
  [Begin Peres recording; superimposed translation into 
Spanish 
in progress] ...this revolution. In all nations, Mexico is 
obviously one of those cases; this is a question of deciding 
whether to purchase a ticket, whether one is going to enter the 
next century in sitting a theater seat or as a participant or an 
actor. Changes in the world are as follows: first, the sources 
of wealth and power are now of an intellectual and not material 
nature. Everything depends on education, science, technology and 
no longer on the wealth of oil or gold mines. Before, oil 
constituted 80 percent of Mexican exports and industrial 
products were 20 percent. That relation has been reversed. [end 
recording] 
  Shim'on Peres arrived at Los Pinos and his movements around 
the city are conducted under tight security measures. A black 
Lincoln with him aboard leads five other cars with his personal 
bodyguards who issue orders in Hebrew, the official language of 
Israel. He has a stern and dry expression, but when he talks he 
becomes another person. He speaks in poetry. He said, for 
instance, that the task of our generation is to eliminate the 
desert from the earth, salt from the water, and violence from 
the people. That is how we will have a happy world. 
  He feels that despite the dangers looming over us there 
never 
can be another Hitler. To conclude, upon leaving Los Pinos, 
Salinas de Gortari informed Peres he would be traveling to 
Jerusalem next year. If the visit materializes, Salinas de 
Gortari would be going as a tourist since he would no longer be 
president, according to the electoral timetable. 
  [Station anchorwoman] Peres will conduct private activities 
in our country, right? 
  [Watson] That is right. He will remain here a few hours and 
then leave. He is on a tour of different Latin American 
countries.

  [Text] Mexico City, 28 May (NOTIMEX) -- Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres said the United States is the head of an 
overall moral operation for peace, stability, liberty, and 
security. 
  At the end of a 48-hour visit to Mexico, the diplomat stated 
there is currently no country that can replace the United States 
in its position before the world. "The United States is not the 
world's gendarme; it is the head of an overall moral operation 
for peace, stability, liberty, and security. It is not a matter 
of having a policeman; instead, it is a highly responsible 
country," he said. 
  Peres and Mexican Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello reported 
the 
acceptance of five Israeli proposals, which include negotiating 
a free trade agreement, avoiding double taxes, carrying out 
cultural exchange, and modifying Mexico's position at the United 
Nations. 
  The Mexican diplomat explained that Israel proposed 
negotiating the bilateral free trade agreement based on the 
agreement it has with the United States and said that this issue 
must be analyzed. 
  The Mexican diplomat said it will be necessary to get the 
text of the U.S.-Israel free trade agreement prior to the 
negotiations so the document can be studied by the Mexican trade 
secretariat to learn what commitments, rights, and obligations 
it entails. After adding that the next step will be to determine 
whether those issues are compatible with Mexican laws, Tello 
said there is certainly a willingness to negotiate the trade 
agreement. 
  The Mexican foreign secretary said the second point proposed 
by Peres to Mexico was to sign a treaty which prevents double 
taxes between the two countries. Work on this treaty is well 
ahead of schedule and is about to conclude; and all they will 
have to do is set the date for signing the document. 
  Tello indicated that another proposal is to sign an 
agreement 
to create a double fund that encourages research and development 
in various sectors, which shall be determined by the two nations. 
  The fourth point in Peres' proposal, he indicated, was to 
adopt specific measures to give an additional boost to cultural 
exchange, and the fifth point refers to the request that Mexico 
modify its position at the United Nations on environment issues.

<F P=106> [Report by Angel Hernandez] </F>
  [Text] Attorney General Humberto Benitez Trevino has begun 
to totally restructure the Federal Judicial Police (PJF) and he 
has ordered the "special groups" and the General Operations 
Coordinating Office to be dismantled. In addition, Benitez 
Trevino is reviewing the relationship of this corps with other 
agencies in an effort to make it more efficient and to prevent 
illegal actions. 
  Five commanders have been discharged and the files of the 
PJF's approximately 2,000 agents, all of whom will undergo drug 
testing, will be carefully reviewed. If evidence of irregular 
or criminal conduct is established, they will be discharged and 
legal action will be taken against them. 
  These actions are being viewed as a response to remarks by 
former Attorney General Diego Valades Rios, who has claimed that 
whenever PJF agents are discharged it is because they have drug 
abuse problems or are connected with drug traffickers. The PGR 
[Attorney General's Office], meanwhile, indicated that the 
measures correspond to the need to have a single command in the 
PJF. 
  Regarding the dismantling of the so-called "special groups," 
the PGR said this action was prompted by "special group" 
investigations that fell outside the Judicial Police General 
Directorate's jurisdiction and proved detrimental to citizens. 
  Commenting on the elimination of the General Operations 
Coordinating Office, which violated PGR regulations, was 
allegedly conducting investigations and had command over the PJF 
agents. [sentence as published] In light of this, Commanders 
Juventino Sanchez Gaytan, Agustin Montiel Lopez, Saul 
Salvatierra Garcia, Carlos Venegas Contreras, and Luis Alberto 
Zetina Suarez were discharged. 
  Meanwhile, Attorney General Benitez Trevino has also ordered 
a rigorous review of the condition and status of the 
approximately 2,000 PJF agents nationwide and evaluations of 
their individual performances in an effort to detect "bad" 
agents. If this review turns up evidence of any agent being 
involved in irregularities or illegal actions, appropriate 
administrative measures will be adopted and legal action will be 
taken. 
  A review of personnel will also be conducted to detect 
"reliable" or "commissoned" individuals, who are also known as 
"godmothers" -- people who do not belong to the PJF but perform 
actions in support of the police corps. Those who have usurped 
powers, as well as the commanders and agents who have helped 
them do so, will be prosecuted.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Today, Attorney General Humberto Benitez Trevino 
said the Federal Judicial Police [PJF] has only one command and 
this will prevent corruption. Mr. Benitez Trevino made this 
statement as he replied to charges by some Catholic Church 
leaders who claim that agents in the PGR [Attorney General's 
Office] are involved in drug trafficking. 
  [Begin Benitez recording] Beginning yesterday, there is only 
one command in the PJF. This is the start of the reorganization 
of the police. [end recording] 
  Interviewed at the end of the first Ibero-American Congress 
on Copyrights, he said the entry of government employees into 
the PGR has been limited. 
  [Begin Benitez recording] The only way to obtain employment 
in the PJF, professional police service, or the PGR will be, 
solely and exclusively, through the Professional Training 
Institute. [end recording] 
  He reiterated that in the fight against corruption, no one 
is 
above the law. Benitez also admitted that crime has increased 5 
percent in the Federal District over the past four months.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the elections scheduled for 
21 August. 
  In Mexico City, officials from eight of the nine political 
parties have signed an Agreement for Electoral Transparency and 
Fairness. In the agreement, the parties committed to taking 
necessary steps to ensure that all stages of the electoral 
process are carried out within a framework of harmony, mutual 
respect, transparency, security, trust, and credibility. The 
director of the National Action Party (PAN) in Mexico City said: 
"Public funds should not be channeled to any political party." 
(Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 20 May 
94) 
  Federal District Mayor Manuel Aguilera Gomez has told the 
leaders of the eight political parties who signed the Agreement 
for Electoral Transparency and Fairness that Mexico City will 
not be held "hostage" to conflict caused by political 
differences among the various parties. Aguilera Gomez said: "If 
we want to live in peace, we must adopt a policy of inclusion, 
not exclusion." (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 10 May 94 pp 
1, 11) 
  The Chamber of Deputies has elected six new advisers who 
will 
form part of the Federal Electoral Institute's General Council 
in the upcoming 21 August elections. All of the advisers meet 
the legal requirement of not having belonged to or led any 
political party over the past three years. The main duty of 
these advisers will be to oversee the election's transparency 
and honesty. (Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in 
Spanish 1300 GMT 25 May 94) 
  PAN candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos claims that ever 
since the 11 May debate, attempts to tarnish his image have 
increased. "I have been accused of being an attorney for drug 
traffickers, a member of Opus Dei, and a member of secret 
organizations," Fernandez said. He said there is an attempt to 
undermine his platform in which he places his trust for 
democracy's victory in Mexico. (Mexico City Canal 13 Television 
Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 25 May 94) 
  PAN candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos has spoken out in 
favor of modifying the Federal Labor Law in an effort to 
modernize it without taking back gains made in the area of 
workers rights. He also said there is an urgent need to 
democratize labor unions. He said: "For the sake of protecting 
the workers, we must seek measures that protect jobs and create 
structures that do not hinder the hiring of workers. We know 
that many times false protectionism only leads to unemployment." 
(Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 26 May 94) 
  After a four-hour meeting, members of the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party's (PRD) National Executive Commission 
decided to accept a debate with Carlos Almaga, director of the 
National Voter Registration Office. The PRD will be represented 
by Samuel del Villar, and it was decided that the debate would 
last 53 minutes instead of 45, as had originally been proposed. 
The debate will take place at Federal Electoral Institute 
Headquarters. PRD leader Porfirio Munoz Ledo said: "Del Villar 
has a knowledge of the issues -- legal as well as technical 
knowledge -- and, therefore, we hope he can demonstrate what is 
evident: the fact that enormous errors exist in the electoral 
register." (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 
26 May 94)

<F P=106> [From the "Sunday Supplemental NTV" newscast] </F>
  [Text] It has been reported in a press release that a group 
of people illegally entered the residence of His Excellency Paul 
Vermeirsch, the Belgian ambassador to Cuba, on the morning of 28 
May in an attempt to push for their departure from Cuba. 
  This new incident is another consequence of the calls to 
illegality made by counterrevolutionary stations broadcasting 
from Miami and, basically, the result of the restrictive 
policies implemented by U.S. immigration authorities who 
continue to block legal procedures for people wanting to 
emigrate to the United States. 
  These people resort to illegal and even violent means to 
depart the country after repeatedly failing to obtain visas. 
The revolutionary government, which does not obstruct those who 
comply with the legal procedures for departing Cuba, has 
reiterated, on several occasions, its commitment to not allowing 
the use of illegal break-ins into diplomatic missions in Cuba as 
a mean of leaving the country.

  [Text] There was an attempted hijacking of a fishing vessel 
in Guantanamo Bay at 0910 on 27 May. The courageous action of 
the boat captain and Interior Ministry guards thwarted the 
hijacking, conducted by five individuals who work at that 
fishing facility. An Interior Ministry soldier was shot and 
injured by the hijackers, who were trying to leave Cuba 
illegally via the Yankee naval base. The hijackers tried to 
reach open seas once their initial plan failed. Two of the 
hijackers have been arrested, while the search for the other 
three continues.

  [Text] Havana, 27 May (EFE) -- The Ministry of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces has reported that a soldier was 
wounded on 27 May when he thwarted an attempt to steal a vessel 
in Guantanamo Bay, eastern Cuba, by five persons who planned to 
leave the country through the U.S. military base located there. 
These people tried to steal a fishing boat but the reaction of 
the owner and the guards thwarted their effort, the source added. 
  In the action, a soldier was wounded "by shots fired by one 
of the attackers," who were trying to illegally leave the 
country via the U.S. military installation. A police report 
stated that the attackers jumped into the sea and so far two of 
them have been arrested and the other three are still at large. 
  On 17 April, Raul Castro, defense minister and second in 
Cuba's political hierarchy, admitted that tranquillity prevailed 
on both sides of the border last year and so far this year. 
"Our determination is to continue doing our part to maintain 
this climate," he added. Castro said that this is the reason 
why all sorts of measures will continue to be applied "to 
frustrate the crazy attempts of those who plan to leave the 
country by this means." He recalled that this is a "highly 
mined" area, and thus, escape attempts are not only "crazy but 
an act of provocation against the country's security."

  [Text] Havana, 30 May (NOTIMEX) -- The Cuban Government 
announced tonight that it will postpone the increase in the 
price of fuel that was to become effective on Wednesday, as 
established in an official agreement. 
  According to a communique released by the Finance and Prices 
Ministry [name of ministry as received], the decision was made 
because private automobile owners still have gasoline ration 
cards that were distributed months ago. 
  The government decided that "during June, prices and sale 
conditions for such ration cards will be the same as those that 
were in effect prior" to the 20 May official agreement, the 
communique noted. The Finance and Price Ministry, however, did 
not indicate if the price increase will go in effect in July or 
at a later date. 
  Private automobile owners have restricted access to gasoline 
through ration cards that are distributed by gasoline 
distributors periodically. Up to 1991, consumers received cards 
that allowed them to purchase up to 230 liters of gasoline each 
quarter. The quota has dropped progressively since then however. 
Ration cards for 20 liters were distributed in April and ration 
cards for this month were for a similar quantity. 
  Premium gasoline will rise from 38 cents to 1.20 pesos per 
liter and regular gasoline will go from 28 cents to 1 peso. A 
Cuban peso is equivalent to one dollar but the local currency is 
exchanged at a rate of 100 pesos per dollar at the black market. 
  In addition to gasoline, the government approved increases 
for the prices of cigarettes and rum, as well as all 
transportation fares.

  [Text] The PRC Foreign Ministry has demanded that all U.S. 
sanctions imposed on that country be lifted. The demand was 
made after the United States renewed its most-favored-nation 
trading status with the PRC. The Foreign Ministry underscored 
in a declaration issued in the Chinese capital after Washington 
announced its decision that the renovation will create favorable 
conditions for strengthening and expanding bilateral economic 
and trade relations. Before the Clinton administration's 
announcement on trade with the PRC, U.S. businessmen had warned 
that interrupting trade relations would cost U.S. consumers more 
than $10 billion. Diplomatic sources in Beijing do not rule out 
that the existing ties could be reinforced by a visit by U.S. 
President Clinton to Beijing sometime this year.

<F P=106> ["Our Opinion" commentary by Orlando Contreras] </F>
  [Text] I would like to read one of today's AFP reports 
before commenting or analyzing: 
  Washington, AFP -- Thursday, President Bill Clinton 
announced 
the renewal of most-favored-nation trading status to the PRC, 
although some sanctions against Beijing were upheld, primarily 
the ban on importing weapons and ammunition. The U.S. leader 
stressed that he had opted to separate the issue of granting 
commercial benefits to the PRC from Washington's previously 
stipulated conditions on the PRC's respect for human rights. 
  As you know, the United States has appointed itself the 
human 
rights judge, except, of course, within its own borders. They 
sanction, however, in accordance with their own judgment, 
whoever does or does not respect human rights everywhere else in 
the world. The world is certainly full of travesties and of 
governments which commit brutal crimes, but Washington does not 
say a word as long as these governments or countries are U.S. 
clients. Something similar occurs with dozens of spurious 
elections on several continents. 
  The PRC Government has strongly and categorically rejected 
the accusations Washington has dared to make regarding human 
rights in the PRC. The PRC's arguments have not convinced the 
U.S. Government. In other words, Clinton and his administration 
believe deep down, above all, that human rights violations do 
exist. I repeat: This is according to the exclusive viewpoint of 
the United States. Clinton, however, decided to maintain the 
commercial benefits, yet another example of double standards of 
that pharisaical type of U.S. policies not grounded on 
principles but on the most coarse and pragmatic of arrangements. 
  On the other hand, the final resolution of the Uruguay Round 
of GATT, as you may remember, called for trade incentives and 
not for protectionism or blockades. Nor did it authorize any 
government to unilaterally make itself into a judge of human 
rights and trade, especially when that government uses the noble 
cause of human rights as a grotesque instrument of its policies 
and for its own benefit. Judges with double standards pervert 
justice.

<F P=106> ["Our America" commentary by Manolo Ortega] </F>
  [Text] The meeting between the six Central American 
presidents and U.S. Vice President Albert Gore has resulted in 
nothing more than disillusion. The Central American presidents 
were disappointed with the so-called Tegucigalpa minisummit 
because Gore rejected any links between their countries and 
NAFTA in the short-, mid-, or long-term. It is true that the 
presidents had extremely high expectations for this meeting, and 
with good reason. To join in an agreement of this nature has 
enormous significance for a region still suffering the effects 
of a 10-year war and ever-increasing poverty levels. 
  Although the United States promised to open its markets to 
textile imports from Central America, this will only happen 
after each Central American country complies with a number of 
requirements and conditions imposed by the United States. These 
conditions include approving a series of labor laws, creating 
laws to protect intellectual property rights and copyrights, 
establishing regulations to protect the environment, and 
complying with NAFTA's rules of origin governing the textile 
sector. 
  The foreign debt, a paramount issue that determines whether 
Central American countries are able to advance economically and 
which precludes the region from undertaking sustainable 
development because of all of the resources it consumes, was not 
discussed at the Tegucigalpa minisummit. We must recall that 
Central America and the Caribbean had accumulated a $37-billion 
foreign debt by the end of 1993. For countries like Nicaragua 
and El Salvador, the foreign debt is an extremely onerous burden 
because these nations have so many economic, political, and 
social problems resulting from their prolonged wars. 
  Leading Central American newspapers have criticized the 
presidential meeting and stress that Vice President Gore did not 
make any clear references to topics of enormous regional 
interest, such as the fight against poverty and the 
often-mentioned regional incorporation into NAFTA. Although 
Hondurans did take advantage of Vice President Gore's visit to 
display posters across the conference hall eloquently asking for 
the withdrawal of U.S. soldiers from their territory, Gore did 
not seem to care at all. Many analysts have agreed that this 
meeting tried to exalt the virtues of the so- called hemispheric 
summit that will be hosted by President Clinton and which seeks 
to become a panacea for this part of the world. The 
presidential summit that will be held in Miami in December has 
been revived by President Clinton precisely at a time when the 
defense and recovery strategies proposed at the various 
Ibero-American summits are now in the process of being 
consolidated. 
  It appears that the Miami meeting is aimed at chastising 
countries looking for a social model different from that of the 
United States, and it seems the session is also designed to 
remind the region that the only country that can convene 
meetings of this nature is the powerful North American nation. 
The hemispheric summit may end up being as disappointing as the 
Tegucigalpa minisummit, where the U.S. Vice President simply 
voiced some promises, all of which were tied to demands that are 
nearly impossible to meet. 
  Central America, a region with a population of 30 million 
and 
still burdened by social injustice and military predominance, 
urgently needs specific development projects, rather than 
promises. In this sense, the visit by the U.S. Vice President 
was fruitless.

<F P=106> [News conference by President Fidel Castro with participants </F>
in the 15th International Tourism Convention in Varadero on 20 
May -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Castro] [passage indistinct] What is better? To 
have them speak first? 
  [Unidentified speaker] Commander, I suggest that you answer 
some of their questions. 
  [Castro] This is like arriving to take a test without having 
studied the subject. 
  [Unidentified speaker] Professors do not have to study the 
subject. 
  [Castro] That is so for professors, but I have been a 
student 
all my life and have always felt like a student whenever I have 
been before an audience. 
  [Unidentified speaker] Commander, I am from Argentina's 
Tele-C News... 
  [Castro, interrupting] Yes, but the question from Argentina 
was left unfinished. [laughter] 
  [Unidentified speaker] I am always on the way. Commander... 
  [Castro, interrupting] Let me stand. I cannot see who is 
speaking. [applause] 
  [Unidentified speaker] Commander, I wanted to ask for the 
[words indistinct] of Argentina: What role do you believe 
tourism plays for Cuba at this historic junction? 
  [Castro] I believe that for everyone [words indistinct]. I 
hope it will play a special role and must say sincerely that we 
are prioritizing it while maintaining other sectors, despite 
everything bad and good tourism is said to bring. I say, as 
some say, because we do not know anything about it. We are now 
beginning to learn. In general, I must stress that I have seen 
good things. I do not know if tourism is categorized as very 
good, outstanding, good, regular, fair, or bad. I have yet to 
see the bad tourism category. Rather, I have seen tourists 
falling into the outstanding and good categories. 
  Anything that helps the economy today is enormously 
important 
to Cuba. This is one of the most influential sectors. This 
sector has maintained a growth rate of a little over 30 percent 
annually. Our future success will depend heavily on our ability 
to work and, particularly, on our ability to attain your 
cooperation worldwide. 
  I believe we have the potential. I believe we have great 
tourism potential and an educated people. We have a highly 
developed spirit of hospitality, as well as the will to do 
things right. 
  However, I will answer your question specifically by saying 
that tourism occupies one of the topmost places at this historic 
junction in the country's life and finances. 
  [Unidentified speaker] Thank you. 
  [BBC correspondent Rose Hays, in English with 
passage-by-passage translation into Spanish] I have been at the 
Varadero convention for a week now. There have been many 
debates on tourism industry profits. It is said that right now 
it has probably reached a phase where tourism profits are 
surpassing sugar industry profits. It has been predicted that 
the tourism industry will surpass sugar as Cuba's main source of 
revenue. Do you agree? 
  [Castro] Yes, at least that is our hope. We hope the tourism 
industry will overcome the sugar industry. I have been 
pondering this. The large-scale sugar industry and tourism seem 
to be two difficult things to reconcile. We have almost 11 
million people and a little over 110,000 square kilometers of 
land. I believe we can do both things right. We have hundreds 
of kilometers of beach and thousands of kilometers of coast, 
some of it nestled between the sea and the mountains. In other 
words, we have great tourism potential. However, we still have 
great sugar potential. 
  Other industries certainly tend to surpass the sugar 
industry 
in modern times. For example, Puerto Rico produced 1 million 
tons of sugar about 30 years ago yet does not produce enough 
sugar today to satisfy national demand. Many sugar fields were 
used to grow other crops, to meet urban growth demands, or to 
establish industrial parks. Above all, the sugar industry is 
very difficult and entails extremely hard work. 
  The introduction of slavery in the Caribbean was followed 
by the development of the sugar industry in the tropical heat. 
It is such hard work that the native population was practically 
unable to do it. This is what gave rise to the macabre idea of 
enslaving Africans to make them work in the fields here, in the 
tropics, because they were better suited to that hard work in 
sugarcane, as well coffee, although coffee is not as hard. 
Sugarcane was the hardest crop because the harvesting and 
weeding had to be done by hand. However, the sugarcane harvest 
demands great effort even if you improve working and living 
conditions. Also, it has a cyclic nature. It does not guarantee 
year-long jobs for everyone. This results in a large emigration 
of the labor force from the sugar fields to other activities. 
  Slavery was allegedly abolished at the turn of the century, 
yet tens of thousands of Caribbean people emigrated from 
Jamaica, Haiti, and other Caribbean islands following the great 
boom the sugar industry experienced after the U.S. intervention, 
when hundreds of millions of dollars -- which had a greater 
value then -- were invested to develop the sugar industry. A 
new form of slavery ensued because the Jamaicans and Haitians 
who came to Cuba to work in the sugarcane lived under similarly 
harsh conditions. It is very hard work. 
  I have noticed that sugar production declines as tourism 
develops in the Caribbean islands. The work force transfers to 
tourism. There are islands of every size, from 400 square 
kilometers to 1,000 square kilometers and every other size in 
between. I have noticed the incompatibility of these 
industries. Boosting the tourism industry has resulted in a 
decline of the sugar industry in those countries. 
  Cuba should be able to maintain a highly vital sugar 
industry 
through mechanization and chemical resources once we are again 
under normal conditions and given the available land area, 
population, machinery, herbicides, and automation processes at 
sugar mills. This is what we plan to do. However, there is a 
sugar mill nearby which is about empty of personnel. Almost 
every worker is here, in Varadero. Tourism work is not as hard 
and is more appealing than agriculture and sugarcane. Yet, I 
believe we have a large enough population to maintain both 
industries. However, tourism's potential, keeping in mind that 
we have thousands of kilometers of virgin beaches, is much 
higher than the sugar industry's potential. 
  If we fully develop our tourism potential, undoubtedly, 
apart 
from other factors, the tourism industry will render much higher 
revenues to Cuba than the sugar industry, even if this 
incompatibility did not exist between both sectors. In 
addition, the tourism market is growing much more than the sugar 
market. I have yet to hear anyone say that sunshine makes you 
fat. [laughter] 
  Unfortunately, people are going around saying that sugar is 
fattening and all those kinds of things, all those calumnies 
against sugar. [laughter] 
  However, tourism is healthy and has great prestige. It seems 
that tourism is the faster growing industry in the world. I 
have heard many people say this. 
  [Unidentified speaker] Once again, for Argentina: Regarding 
the U.S. blockade, is the Clinton administration as severe as 
previous administrations? 
  [Castro] I would have to ask you to define severity. 
  [Unidentified speaker] Argentina is well aware of the U.S. 
position, which is not fair to the Cuban people. This is why I 
ask the question. You raised this issue last year, when I had 
the opportunity to meet you and the Council of State. I would 
like to know your thoughts on this today. 
  [Castro] I could say that Clinton maintains the same 
severity, because he maintains the blockade, the Torricelli Law, 
everything. However, he does so in a softer manner and with less 
threatening and less bellicose words. But the severity of U.S. 
policy toward Cuba has not changed. It remains the same. 
  [Rene Capriles, correspondent for Brazil's ECO RIO 
magazine] Commander, I had the pleasure of hearing you at the 
Rio summit. Your address was the most applauded, even by 
President Bush, which was a surprise, as you might remember. 
  You just came from a conference on island-states and 
biodiversity. Biodiversity plays an important role worldwide 
when it comes to genetic patents, on which Cuba has broad 
experience. What are Cuba's prospects in this regard, 
considering tourism, island-states, and the creation of the 
Caribbean common market in the future? 
  [Castro] The analysis of environmental problems was good at 
the Barbados meeting. Both the environment and sustainable 
development were discussed. We noticed in Rio that 
island-states are highly anxious about this. I noticed that 
many countries are highly anxious about the prospects that 
global...[pauses] changes in weather patterns and the greenhouse 
effect. Changes in weather patterns mean more droughts, more 
intense hurricanes, and other climate phenomena which are 
generally disastrous for those small nations. 
  While a hurricane in Florida damages a very small portion of 
the territory, a hurricane on St. Vincent or on any other small 
Caribbean island -- such as St. Lucia or Jamaica -- covers 100 
percent of the island's territory and can destroy everything. 
The rest of the nation can help Florida repair the hurricane 
damage. Islands face territorial limitations and serious 
communication problems. A man from Santiago de Cuba was 
complaining because there are no direct flights between Mexico 
and Santiago de Cuba. Yet, there are no flights between many 
Carribean islands. There are no flight routes. Sea 
transportation is also very difficult. These countries 
experience diverse difficulties for their development. 
  They are affected the most, environmentally speaking. Many 
of those islands, particularly those in the Pacific, would 
disappear if the water were to rise four meters. It would be a 
global disaster because it would affect every port's 
infrastructure. However, certain countries would disappear 
altogether. Certain countries, such as Bangladesh, with a 
population of over 100 million people, would disappear almost 
completely, despite being one of the most densely populated 
countries. 
  Of course, this explains the high anxiety experienced by 
these states and why it was decided at the Rio summit to hold an 
international conference of small island-states. There was an 
increased awareness of the problem in Barbados, more of an 
awareness than in Rio. However, the Rio summit and the efforts 
of the nongovernmental organizations were extremely significant 
in creating an awareness of this problem. I dare affirm 90 
percent of the governments of the world were not aware of 
ecological problems. 
  This was the first time that dozens of heads of state had a 
chance to think about these problems and were compelled to think 
about them. The representatives of the most industrialized 
nations also had to speak and explain things in Rio. 
Consumerist societies are the main culprits of the destructive 
phenomena that has ravished the environment in past decades. 
They consume an overwhelming majority of energy and fossil fuel 
and have poisoned the rivers, lakes, and seas the most. They 
have poisoned the air, have created acid rain, and have 
increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. They are creating 
serious, real problems, including extremely serious problems 
with weather pattern changes. 
  This awareness is somewhat late. Certain damages are already 
irreversible. The amounts of fluorocarbons released have 
damaged the ozone layer and will continue to do so for a long 
time. We must ask ourselves if there is still time to reverse 
this trend. However, since we cannot afford to be pessimistic, 
the least we can do is fight hard to increase awareness so that 
measures are adopted as soon as possible to solve these problems. 
  You might remember from Rio that the U.S. Government 
objected 
and put up the most resistance to the accords. It was 
practically isolated. I must add that this is not the case with 
the current administration. This administration is more 
concerned with environmental issues. The U.S. vice president 
has a book out on the environment. I believe he is quite 
committed to environmental issues. The United States, the 
number one consumer of energy and natural resources, is called 
upon to play a very important role here. 
  This is why any change in the U.S. Government's position 
must seen as positive. This had not taken place yet at the time 
of the Rio summit but was hinted at in the U.S. representative's 
address in Rio and noticed again during the Barbados conference. 
  We must fight harder and harder and harder if we want to 
avoid the catastrophe of incalculable magnitude toward which we 
are heading right now. This is an issue that can be discussed 
at length. A great many variables enter into play because the 
development of various countries can differ so greatly. I 
pointed out in Barbados that Bangladesh's per capita income is 
$220, while Switzerland's is $34,000. [Words indistinct] 1 
billion tons of carbon is consumed. How much more do the 
Chinese people need to attain a gross income 10 times higher? 
India has similar problems. These are very complex, acute 
problems. How will global resources be distributed? How will 
development be apportioned? Will we just decide to leave 
developing nations as they are while developed nations continue 
to develop? 
  Mankind must exert great effort and revise certain theories. 
I hinted at this in my 15-minute address on the problems of 
inequitable worldwide development. What does the future hold 
for a society that can only survive by growing and can only grow 
by depleting the world's natural resources? That question has 
no answer. They are condemned to grow. This is why when one 
speaks of sustainable development, no one knows what one is 
talking about. We ought to speak of societies that can sustain 
themselves or that can survive as they are by recycling and 
reducing levels of carbon dioxide and other polluting gases and 
not by continuing to deplete natural resources. 
  Neoliberalism is in vogue today. However, we are not talking 
politics here, nor do we want to discuss politics. Yet, it is 
in fashion. Neoliberalism is based on the concept of continuous 
growth to prevent a disaster. However, continuous growth will 
result in a bigger disaster. We must focus primarily on the 
growth of those countries further behind, the poorest nations. 
We must do a better job distributing the world's natural 
resources. We must distribute the world's wealth better and 
more equally. Otherwise, the problems will not be solved. Yet, 
we cannot discuss this further here nor turn this into a 
conference on extremely complex philosophical issues. We risk 
missing the mark regarding tourism. 
  [Faustino Castilla, director of Spain's VIAJE Y TOURISMO 
magazine] How can capitalist and socialist views coexist in the 
tourism industry? Unfortunately, I remember what the Cuban 
tourism industry had to endure in the '50s. That was not like 
tourism today but was tourism, nevertheless. How can both 
doctrines coexist today? 
  I would also like to present to you an example of Habanera, 
a 
typically Cuban-Spanish form of music that symbolizes 
Cuban-Spanish unity. [applause] 
  [Castro] He asks: How can the two views coexist? That of 
tourism and what else? Within tourism? You refer to joint 
investments, right? 
  Unfortunately, I do not have Karl Marx, Frederick Engels, or 
Vladimir Ilich Lenin by my side to help me answer your question. 
Yet, I believe, referring even to the founders of socialism, 
Lenin for example, at the time of the famous Bolshevik 
revolution, had even considered the idea of establishing 
capitalism under the control of the proletariat. Lenin's 
original idea was to establish socialism in that country, which 
was one of the most industrially backward, a country besieged 
and blockaded. Lenin finally came up with the idea of 
developing capitalism in Russia, not under the control of 
capitalists but under the control of workers. There were other 
ideas among the political leaders of that era: The 
impossibility of establishing socialism in only one country. 
This was discussed extensively. 
  We must add that among the CPSU's founding concepts was the 
idea that the revolution was going to take place simultaneously 
in every industrialized nation. History has still not proven 
that that was wrong. Although, I will keep my opinion regarding 
what has happened in those countries, there is no doubt that 
building socialism in one single country, entirely surrounded by 
industrialized capitalist countries [words indistinct]. Their 
accomplishments were, in my opinion, truly extraordinary. They 
will be praised someday once this contemporary period is over. 
They conceived with a highly dialectic sense and flexibility 
how to build socialism. 
  We have not relinquished the idea of building socialism. 
We have not relinquished our goals. We are simply adapting to 
our current reality and acknowledging that under such 
exceptional circumstances, following the collapse of the 
socialist bloc and the disappearance of the USSR, our goals 
cannot be the building of socialism but the defense of the 
fatherland, the revolution, and accomplishments of socialism. 
  The development of any country requires capital, technology, 
and markets which we do not have at this time. These are far 
from ideal conditions. We are no longer dealing with building 
socialism in a single country but on a tiny island lost 
somewhere in the Caribbean, lost geographically but not 
politically. 
  Tourism provided the first opportunity to create joint 
associations and to introduce foreign capital in Cuba. We need 
all three things -- capital, technology, and markets -- to 
develop tourism in Cuba. We did not hesitate on the need to 
promote its development. We have been talking about tourism, 
which is a very typical example. There are many other fields 
where the same is happening or could be happening, like the oil 
sector. 
  We will never exploit the oil beneath the Varadero 
peninsula. 
We do not want to...[pauses] A well had already been drilled 
nearby, but we closed it. Estimates have been made on the 
amount of fuel underground, but Varadero's tourism development 
and oil extraction are incompatible. Developing Varadero's 
tourism will yield much more than the extraction of the oil 
underneath it. 
  There are diverse positive indicators regarding the presence 
of oil. However, we need seismological research with advanced 
technology, well-drilling, and capital investment. We do not 
have the capital or the technology to exploit these resources. 
How could we do this if not by associating with foreign 
companies and capital? It would not be socialist but stupid to 
turn a blind eye to this reality. Nothing would be accomplished 
if we did that. We would be left stranded, would fail to 
fulfill the goal of defending the fatherland, the revolution, 
and the accomplishments of socialism. I have given two examples. 
  As we set off down this path -- free of dogma, armed with 
flexibility, and keeping clearly in mind our goals and the means 
to attain them -- we have been making this overture, which 
continues to expand. I believe our goals and the means being 
used to attain them are perfectly in keeping with one another. 
The goals we are seeking are perfectly in keeping with the 
means we are using to achieve them. 
  To tell the truth, it is very important that there be trust. 
We have taken great pains to ensure that we have created trust 
among those who invest in Cuba and are giving investors 
advantages they do not get in many other parts of the world so 
as to make investing here truly attractive. 
  [Words indistinct] show that those first experiences were 
successful. We must calculate how much the capital yields in 
each European country. How much in Italy? How much in 
Switzerland? How much in France? How much must be paid in 
rent? How much does capital invested in Costa Brava, Spain, 
yield? How much in the Canary Islands? We must find ways to 
make capital yield more in Cuba than it does in Costa Brava, the 
Canary Islands, or any other country. 
  All in all, it is a competition. I believe that we are in a 
position to compete and that Cuba has some advantages. As the 
managers of this hotel can attest, cooperation between the 
population and the investors is high because we have persuaded 
the population of the need to take these steps, these measures, 
and to make these investments. 
  I want to stress to you that our people are socialist. 
Harbor no doubts: Our people cannot return to capitalism. 
However, they understand perfectly well all the measures we are 
taking in this sphere and that the associations with capitalist 
companies are in response to the reality of today's world. 
Thus, we have growing ties with multinationals. We do. This 
is a reality and a power in today's world. No one in today's 
world can do without multinationals, because their power 
continues to increase. They have more power, even more than 
governments. The power of governments is declining and that of 
multinationals increasing. We are surrounded by capitalists in 
this world. 
  We are told in geography class that an island is a piece of 
land surrounded by water on all sides. If someone were to ask 
us at present to define socialism in Cuba, the answer would be: 
A noble, courageous, heroic effort surrounded by capitalism on 
all sides. [laughter] 
  We cannot ignore capitalism any more than we can ignore the 
sea around us. Besides -- and this was pointed out by Marx -- 
capitalism has made significant contributions to mankind's 
economic development, such as technological and scientific 
contributions and a great development of the productive forces. 
We could add other things that were unknown at Marx's time: 
management capability, [words indistinct], use of computers in 
administration and management. We could add many other 
contributions capitalism has made to mankind. 
  Also, it would be stupid of me not to make use of any useful 
experience capitalism can contribute. This is how we see what 
we are doing, without relinquishing our principles, goals, or 
ideals. I believe Cuba is not the only country doing this. The 
Chinese people are doing it and have been doing it much longer 
than we. The Vietnamese people are doing it and have had very 
significant successes. However, history will have the last 
word. New paths are always strewn with obstacles, problems, and 
difficulties. Our intelligence and wisdom should help us 
overcome all these difficulties. 
  There are many other difficulties. There are difficulties 
that are not political, ideological, or philosophical in nature. 
Other difficulties could be of a moral nature. 
  I was explaining to the comrades and have at times explained 
to the Cuban people that we cannot afford to be pure within a 
glass case. Purity is not as praiseworthy if one is alone, 
isolated, unpolluted, free of contact with any virus, germ, or 
bacteria. Virtue blooms in the struggle against vice. These 
methods or things we are introducing might bring with them 
certain vices, yet this can serve to develop our virtue. 
  Many have questioned the influence tourism might have upon 
the minds of our people, upon their basic traits. These matters 
have come up. However, experience is teaching us that we can 
develop our country perfectly well. Cuba's ties, culture, and 
contact with the world are growing. We will be all the more 
pure if we are able to preserve our virtues amid the 
contamination certain things might bring with them. I believe 
we will do so in this effort we are making. It will be, above 
all, a test. 
  I once used a metaphor but later had to recant because it 
was 
wrong. I said that virtue could not be preserved in a cloister, 
a convent. Several nuns immediately wrote me and told me the 
remark was unfair. I agreed with them and no longer speak of 
cloisters or convents. I speak of ivory towers. [laughter, 
applause] 
  [Unidentified speaker] [Words indistinct] 
  [Castro] From what magazine? 
  [Unidentified speaker] (SUARA), a magazine with a 
circulation 
of over 300,000 and [words indistinct]. I will not ask any 
questions because my questions were answered by the minister. I 
asked if Cuba was ready to welcome tourists and so on. As you 
have said... 
  [Castro, interrupting] What did he answer? Yes? 
  [Unidentified speaker] Yes. 
  [Castro] He lied to your readers. [laughter] 
  Did he say we were ready or learning? 
  [Unidentified speaker] No, no. This is my first trip to 
Cuba. I want to take this opportunity to do something very 
personal or my daughter will never forgive me: I must tell you 
that she admires you greatly. She is 15 years old, and we have 
explained to her that Cuba is the only socialist country left in 
the world. She asked me to tell you that she is at your service 
for whatever you might need and that you can always count on her 
help. [applause] 
  She has written many letters to you that remain on her desk. 
I have explained to her that it is not easy to reach you. 
However, I will not leave Cuba without asking you to please 
sign this for her and to take our picture. Otherwise, she would 
never forgive me. I am sorry, but this is my only chance. I 
hope the others will forgive me. [applause] 
  [Castro] I will take a chance and honor your request, 
although I can foresee about 350 more like them...[pause] 
  Those noble feelings of solidarity encourage us along, in 
this struggle. Our struggle is not easy. Not everyone 
understands it. I have wanted to talk about it. The fact that 
there are so many good and noble people in the world fills us 
with energy and is an extraordinary boost to continuing to 
struggle, resist, and triumph. Thank you very much. [applause] 
  [(Pablo Amalce), Spanish national radio editor and deputy 
director of VIAJEROS magazine's Cuba section] [Words indistinct] 
in the world, the matter of image as regards tourism. A 
country's image is vital. You know that it is oversimplified 
sometimes. There is also the pitfall of putting forth an image 
currently being used by several other countries, resulting in a 
failure to present the unique characteristics of a destination. 
  What do you -- the president of the Republic of Cuba, a 
great 
communicator, and someone who knows how to rouse and motivate 
diverse audiences well -- think Cuba's tourism image ought to be? 
  [Castro] I do not know what a communicator is. That is a 
technical term used nowadays regarding television, radio, and 
other such resources. I have always relied on the same thing: 
speaking very frankly and trying to explain things as I see 
them. If I do not understand something, I do not attempt to 
explain it. I have endured enough of that in school already. I 
had teachers who explained things in the books that they did not 
understand, could not understand either. 
  First, we could say that Cuba presents the image of a 
beautiful country. It has the natural, physical conditions. 
Columbus first took notice of this. It is a proven fact that 
when he arrived in Cuba, he said it was the most beautiful land 
human eyes had ever seen. I do not know if Columbus ever said 
this to a woman, but it is a fact that he said it about Cuba. 
We have an image as a country of extreme natural beauty. 
However, its people are more important than the land. Cuba's 
image is that of an hospitable, warm, generous, fraternal 
nation. We want the image of a morally and physically healthy 
nation. We want the image of an organized country, the image of 
a country which protects the environment, the air, the water, 
with pure waters, pure air, a welcoming climate. Of course, we 
are a tropical country. Many visitors come from frigid places, 
particularly in winter. They come to escape the snow and cold 
weather or the like. 
  We do not want to be seen as a country with gambling or 
drugs 
or prostitution. We have the image of a country with a high 
level of culture and capability [words indistinct] and pleasant 
the stay of our visitors. We want to educate the people on this 
profession of hospitality so that services can attain levels 
equal or superior to those found in any other country. We want 
a tourism of the people. Everyone wants the tourists to pay more 
money for greater luxury. Of course, we will have some services 
that will also serve those who can afford higher prices. 
However, we also want tourism to be a source of knowledge, 
contact, and brotherly ties among the peoples. 
  We also want the world to see Cuba as an honest country, a 
moral country. This is highly cherished by us because we know 
that in the world such qualities are not abundant. Finally, I 
will borrow from the Bible and Adam and Eve, who are said to 
have been very happy in Eden: We want the world to see Cuba as 
a terrestrial paradise. [applause] 
  [Ed Caprice, director of Berlin's Tropicana tourist company] 
Mr. President, it is not always easy for a small tour operator 
who is not under the German tourism conglomerates' control to 
bring tourism to Cuba. However, I do not want to dwell on the 
difficulties but on the happy moments. One such occasion took 
place recently, when a group of over 40 people came to Santiago 
de Cuba. All of their misgivings were cleared up by the time 
they returned to Berlin. Some of them asked before departing 
Berlin: Can we really travel to Cuba, given the current 
difficulties in supplying the population? However, they were 
all very happy and taken by the tropical beauty, the hospitality 
you mentioned, the revolutionary spirit of the Cuban people 
[words indistinct]. The oldest in the group -- an 84-year-old 
man -- said that the trip to Cuba was the happiest time in his 
entire life. 
  Mr. President, I would like you to accept the catalog we 
have 
put together for Cuba with all our love. Thank you, very much. 
[applause] 
  [Unidentified speaker] Commander Fidel, I have come from 
Bolivia with a friend who works in an enterprise. First, I want 
to express Bolivia's love and admiration for your efforts on the 
Cuban people's survival and freedom and for being an example of 
independence to all Latin American leaders. I do not want to 
leave Cuba without firmly shaking your hand as a symbol of the 
struggle against the economic blockade endured by Cuba and its 
people. [applause] 
  [Emilio Galdez, sales director of Grupo Sol in Cuba] I do 
not 
have any questions because I already have my answers after 
living in Cuba for three and a half years; I received them on a 
daily basis from the honest efforts of the Cuban people and the 
efforts which I have witnessed at all levels day to day in the 
tourism sector, as well as in the society. I ask that you 
continue your struggle and your efforts, which in the last three 
and a half years have yielded results and successes. I ask that 
you continue to set the example which other countries were, 
perhaps, not virtuous enough to adopt. 
  I refer to positive and negative things which have been 
attained in tourism. For example, in my country -- Spain -- we 
have had many successes, but we must lament not having been 
successful in other things and even failures. We have 
experienced a crisis from which we are now recovering. We will 
have to make investments to regain the levels of years ago. 
  Keeping these things in mind, I ask of you to continue this 
path to attain what I believe everyone augurs for this beautiful 
country, which has all the right conditions to fulfill its 
goals. My cooperation with Cuba does not end, but my stay does 
in two months. I must follow orders. My boss has asked me, and 
I agree. I must return to Majorca. 
  However, during my stay in Cuba I have had the great luck of 
working with and making friends not easily found in other 
countries, wholehearted friends, true friends to the end. I 
have had the luck of meeting my wife and having a daughter -- 
Daria Lucia -- in this beautiful country. She is 44 days old 
today. Therefore, my wish is that very soon and before she can 
talk, but when she can understand me I will be able to tell her 
that Cuba has overcome the very difficult special period because 
it truly deserves it. 
  Finally, it is also my wish -- I have asked many friends at 
work to help me with this -- to take a photo of you with me and 
my wife and daughter. 
  Dear friends, I ask you to continue working together and 
more 
united and strong each day for the good and future of tourism in 
Cuba! Viva Cuba! Viva Fidel! Viva the Revolution! [applause, 
pause] 
  [Castro] I have been told that you have made a great effort 
and that it is time to conclude this meeting. I believe you 
have other things scheduled, including a closing ceremony. Is 
that right? When? At nine? I imagine you have to go to your 
rooms and do things. I believe I have tired you enough. 
  It has been a great pleasure to come to this meeting. We 
have heard very friendly words and intelligent and interesting 
questions. We have also experienced moving moments, such as the 
case of the comrade who spoke just now and introduced his wife 
and daughter. We have seen a great example of the ties and 
relations that can be established among the peoples through 
tourism. He asked us to continue along this path. I can affirm 
that we will and that we will never betray the trust of those 
who believed in us. [applause] 
  Our word and commitments are sacred. In no [words 
indistinct] of law, or any canon by Osmany, because we have the 
canon of honor, seriousness, the given word which will always 
prevail. We follow principles of honesty and good faith. We 
follow principles of optimism, and that will always prevail. 
  We only began a short while back and can already see certain 
results. I believe we can speak of a future, given the efforts 
we are conducting. You cannot imagine with what difficulties we 
began to build those renowned causeways. This has helped us 
gain access to marvelous beaches, as marvelous as this Varadero 
beach, in other places around Cuba. We will continue working in 
this manner, with efforts and sacrifice. We cannot nor do we 
deny that we are working under hard and difficult conditions. 
  This is why words such as the ones we have heard today are 
so encouraging; the words of the lady who spoke about her 
daughter and the faith and trust she has in Cuba; the words, the 
words by the Bolivian gentleman; those by the German gentleman. 
I mentioned this because he relayed a message from an 
84-year-old man who said his stay had been the happiest days of 
his life; 84 is a considerable age. Those of us who are a 
little younger felt it. [laughter] 
  An 84-year-old man has experienced practically the entire 
century. He lived through World Wars I and II and has 
experienced calamities of every kind, hard and good moments in 
his life. The fact that he felt the happiest here is 
encouraging and honors us. 
  I will try to maintain that tradition and set this example 
for as long as I can. I am sorry not everyone is here, but this 
hall can only accommodate so many. 
  As you can see, we have a brand new minister. [applause] 
  Perhaps I am getting ahead of myself and prompted your 
generous applause. He has yet to earn that applause. What I 
should have said is that we have a brand new ministry. We must 
find out if we have a brilliant minister. [applause] 
  This has to be seen. However, we have the greatest hope that 
he will prove so. [applause] 
  In any case, another will have to if he does not prove so. 
[laughter] 
  What is clear is that we need a good ministry and an even 
better minister. He has many ideas and initiatives that have 
been warmly welcomed and endorsed. I hope that this will help 
accelerate the development of tourism in Cuba, which will 
continue to have the support of our people, government, and 
everyone. 
  I want to add: Our people did not understand tourism at 
first. It was necessary to conduct an educational campaign so 
that our people, who had been brought up in the strictest ivory 
tower puritanism, would understand the need for tourism, its 
portended dangers, what tourism would represent, etc. 
  I assure you that that struggle is being amply won and that 
the people's enthusiasm and happiness is immediately recognized 
anywhere in Cuba today where a new tourist project is announced. 
  We have had to do difficult things to reconcile certain 
issues. The people had a hard time understanding the dollar 
decriminalization issue, which is why we have had to explain 
every step. We normally explain things to the people. We do 
not want things to appear by decree but by persuading the 
population. We had to explain our own difficulties, the excess 
of currency we have and which any tourist or tour operator 
understands readily, the approximate value of a peso, a dollar, 
a pound. This required taking measures to correct the national 
financial imbalance. However, these measures were not taken by 
decree or accord of the Council of Ministers but were discussed 
at the National Assembly of the People's Government. They were 
discussed at every workplace with millions of workers. A 
consensus was reached before measures were taken. 
  We sometimes have difficult tasks. You see this everywhere. 
However, I believe the essential key is to persuade the people 
and to attain a consensus among the population for every step 
taken. This is how our population came to understand the need 
for tourism and understands it more and more each day. They 
understood the need for the highly touted decriminalization of 
dollars and all that. 
  Our people were brought up in deeply rooted egalitarism, and 
anytime anything gave the appearance of privilege it upset them. 
For example, if someone has a wealthy relative abroad who sends 
things the others did not have, that is still a certain 
privilege. Our population had a very deep sense of equality. We 
have explained to them that this is necessary, that it helps the 
national economy, that it helps those who do not have wealthy 
relatives abroad and that somehow what is received makes its way 
back to them. That is the argument we used to persuade our 
people. I am happy to see how they have come to understand and 
to support tourism. 
  I must also add that I am pleased, very pleased to have had 
the opportunity to meet outstanding people such as you. 
  Thank you, very much. [applause]

  [Text] As of 26 May, the Havana Public Prosecutor's Office 
has carried out joint operations with combined Interior Ministry 
forces in five municipalities against 28 people identified as 
being involved in the criminal actions contemplated in 
Decree-Law 149 of the Council of State. 
  The operation against the so-called hoarders ranged from 
raids on homes to arrests as necessary. The preliminary seizure 
of goods included freezing bank accounts totaling 270,000 pesos 
and confiscating $540, 15 automobiles, seven motorcycles of 
diverse makes, three trucks, 500 animals, and 57 different 
pieces of jewelry. The seizures also included several 
properties, machines, tools, raw materials, fuel, and other 
items. The authorities are currently investigating the origin 
and suppliers of these items as well as conducting other related 
police and judicial procedures. 
  During the fourth special session of the People's Government 
in Havana, this station learned that legal action has been taken 
against 100 cases of illegal sale and purchase of automobiles as 
well as 100 cases on housing, which range from the illegal sale 
and purchase of houses to fraudulent swaps. 
  Glenda Azoy, member of the provincial bureau of the Cuban 
Communist Party in Havana, told reporters that this is not just 
another temporary police program but a continuous offensive 
against illegal actions and lack of respect for the law. We 
will be strict and just in all cases, she said, but the measures 
provided for by Decree-Law 149 are here to stay to benefit the 
law and the interests of the Revolution.

  [Text] Today, Cuba and Spain signed a bilateral agreement 
on promoting and protecting investments in Havana in the 
presence of Politburo member Carlos Lage and other high ranking 
Spanish and Cuban officials. 
  Cuban and Spanish experts at the fourth Spanish-Cuban joint 
commission for economic cooperation concluded two days of 
intense work by signing a bilateral agreement on promoting and 
protecting investments. The future of economic and financial 
relations between Cuba and Spain, one of the island's main 
trading partners, was discussed after the agreement was signed 
by Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, Spanish secretary of state for foreign 
trade, and Ernesto Melendez, Cuban foreign investment and 
economic cooperation minister: 
  [Begin recording] [Ruiz] This agreement is most important. 
We 
would call this an agreement of the new generation since it 
provides confidence and judicial security and a proper setting 
for investors. Of course, pioneering investors arrive before 
the agreements themselves. But I believe the signing of this 
agreement is extremely important for those pioneers and those 
that may follow. We have already established similar agreements 
with other Latin American countries, and it was important that 
we sign such an agreement with Cuba. I believe we can present 
this to our respective economic sectors as a big step. 
  [Melendez] We were able to examine an important area in our 
economic and trade relations. This agreement is the final 
result of that examination. I would even say that the document 
reaffirms the friendship and political willingness of the two 
governments to maintain, strengthen, and expand our relations. 
We have discussed trade and financial relations, and we have 
underscored the importance of seeking ways to strengthen our 
relations. [end recording]

protection of investments. He said Cuba has signed similar 
documents with Italy and Switzerland and that another is being 
negotiated with Great Britain. Spain is Cuba's most important 
trade partner. Spanish firms participate in one out of every 
four economic associations created with foreign capital on the 
island.

  [Text] Havana, 27 May (NOTIMEX) -- Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, 
Spanish secretary of state for foreign trade, disclosed here 
today that Spain proposed Cuba step up the pace of the economic 
reforms aimed at reorganizing the island's economy. 
  In a brief news conference, Ruiz said he met with Vice 
President Carlos Lage and other members of the Cuban economic 
cabinet, who explained the difficulties in accelerating these 
changes. In any case, Ruiz added, Spain perceives that the 
measures adopted by the Cuban Government, such as the 
legalization of the possession of foreign currency and the 
increases in prices and fees, are not isolated and form part of 
a comprehensive package. 
  Ruiz lamented the drop in Cuba's capacity to export to Spain 
as a result of the current economic crisis and indicated that if 
the supply of Cuban merchandise increases, Madrid would be able 
to increase its purchases. According to sources close to the 
Spanish delegation, bilateral trade amounted to approximately 
$290 million in both directions. 
  On Friday, Cuba and Spain expressed their interest in 
extending their economic cooperation to areas other than tourism 
by signing an agreement for the mutual promotion and protection 
of investments. "This new generation agreement is very 
important because it establishes confidence, legal security, and 
an adequate framework for investors," Ruiz Ligero said after 
signing the agreement at the end of two days of talks. 
  Ruiz also signed with Ernesto Melendez, Cuban minister for 
foreign investment and economic cooperation, the final document 
of the fourth meeting of the joint intergovernmental commission, 
which held sessions in Havana. The two officials highlighted 
the "simple, brief, smooth, and easy" way that the negotiations 
took place, indicating that they reaffirmed Havana and Madrid's 
political resolve to strengthen economic and financial ties. 
  "We have given ourselves the challenge of making sure that 
in 
the medium term, these relations will be good and that we will 
be able to lay the foundations for greater cooperation in the 
future," Ruiz stressed. He arrived in Havana on Wednesday. 
"The negotiations were very simple and we can present our 
economic sectors with substantial progress," the high-ranking 
Spanish official said. He also met here with Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina and other officials. 
  "The increasing way that the Spanish entrepreneur is in our 
market and in tourism investments bodes well for our work 
prospects. We are very pleased with the results of the talks," 
Melendez said. Sources of the Cuban delegation told NOTIMEX 
that "one of the basic conclusions is that investments are a 
fundamental element for the development of relations and 
everything possible must be done to increase them."

  [Text] A delegation headed by Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina has departed for the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] 
ministerial summit in Cairo. Robaina explained the goals of the 
summit, Cuba's position, and his visit to Qatar before departing: 
  [Begin Robaina recording] The goals are not far from the 
aspirations Cuba has always defended regarding the NAM. Since 
Cuba became a member, it has always called for strengthening the 
Movement and its authority in representing the poor of the Earth 
and those who do not have enough resources to allow their 
peoples to live the way they deserve and to attain a voice and 
authority that can be heard in the international arena. 
  These main goals that unite us are to strengthen the NAM and 
to turn the NAM into a strong force at the United Nations and 
other international forums and discussions. I believe in 
turning the NAM into a truly integrated force, not only in terms 
of North-South cooperation but also in terms of South-North 
cooperation. Why not South-South cooperation? All these things 
are part of the very broad agenda which we will discuss in Cairo. 
  I will visit Qatar at the invitation of that country's 
foreign minister, who, as you know, visited Cuba a few months 
ago. The main goal of this trip is to open our diplomatic 
mission in Qatar. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Rey Rodriguez from the NTV newscast] </F>
  [Text] As part of the Cuban Foreign Ministry's diplomatic 
offensive, a delegation headed by Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina has departed for the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] 
ministerial summit in Cairo. One of the summit's main goals is 
to strengthen South-South cooperation as well as to draft 
guidelines for the Movement's future. This was pointed out by 
Robaina during a news conference. He also discussed other 
important issues, such as the forthcoming Ibero-American summit: 
  [Begin recording] [Robaina] Three main issues dealing with 
economic aspects and Latin American integration will be 
discussed. In all likelihood, Cartagena will be a forum to 
reaffirm the willingness of the Ibero-American peoples and where 
Cuba will undoubtedly have to speak of the motives behind the 
call to a hemispheric summit in Miami which excludes Cuba. It 
is important to discuss our view on this maneuver in Cartagena. 
  Regarding the blockade, no one has the least doubt that 
given 
what was accomplished in Bahia...[pauses] I believe other things 
happened after the Bahia summit. There was a strong resolution 
of support at the United Nations, and there is an ever 
increasing commitment among many countries, peoples, and 
governments. 
  [Rodriguez] Minister, what is Cuba's position on the 
hemispheric summit? Do you believe it is an alternative to the 
Ibero-American summits? 
  [Robaina] I would say that, rather than an alternative, it 
is 
undoubtedly a maneuver to discredit, diminish the authority, and 
overshadow the results of the Ibero-American summits. I also 
believe that if the regional superpower really meant to meet 
with every country in the region, it would have given more 
consideration to events, time, and place. In my opinion, the 
manner in which this has been organized speaks by itself of the 
[words indistinct] what we have been doing with Ibero-America. 
If we are not included, they still want to discuss Cuba which 
has been singled out and toward that end selected Miami. 
  [Rodriguez] If Cuba were to be invited to the hemispheric 
summit in Miami, would Cuba attend? 
  [Robaina] Rather than my opinion, it is the belief of the 
country's leadership -- the president himself has said it -- 
that we are not afraid to attend any forum we are invited to no 
matter where, even Miami. Cuba does not seek an invitation. 
Even if Cuba had been invited to that summit, it would have 
questioned the manner in which the summit was called, without 
considering the participant countries' opinions. Cuba is 
willing to go, however, and explain its project of truth and 
work anywhere our presence is requested. [end recording]

  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina met several 
officials in Cairo early this morning, including Zimbabwean 
Foreign Minister Nathan Shamuyarira, Vietnamese Foreign Minister 
Nguyen Manh Cam, and Arab League Secretary General Issmat 'Abd 
al-Majid. 
  Upon arriving in Cairo last night, Robaina emphasized that 
although times are not the same as 40 years ago, the Nonaligned 
Movement [NAM] maintains its importance. Robaina pointed out 
that NAM members have the right to be heard in the concert of 
nations since the organization encompasses more than two-thirds 
of mankind. He added that this right can be justified today more 
than ever due to increasing international instability, the 
emergence of a militarily and politically unilateral world, and 
the concentration of economic power in the countries of the 
North. 
  Robaina said: This is more than enough reason to attend a 
meeting such as this, with the interest of not only establishing 
positions but also putting things into motion. The meetings for 
experts, who will discuss the topics to be covered by the 
foreign ministers beginning tomorrow, began this morning.

  [Text] The Cuban Government does not see any speedy chance 
of improving relations with the United States. Isabel Allende, 
acting foreign minister of Cuba, says there has been no progress 
in relations, even during President Clinton's era. Allende is 
critical of the United States for politicizing Cuban 
immigration, saying that Cuba has launched a program seeking to 
expand Cuba's foreign political relations. Antti Halinen met 
the acting Cuban foreign minister in Havana. 
  [Halinen] No progress can be seen in the relations between 
the United States and Cuba, says acting Foreign Minister Isabel 
Allende very curtly. We waited to see what the Clinton 
administration would do, but reality remains precisely the same, 
only the political form is slightly softer, Allende says. She 
refers to Clinton's recent meeting with some Cubans of Miami at 
which the president promised to continue the trade and economic 
embargo against Cuba. Progress has not been made in other 
sectors either, even though Cuba has announced that it is 
prepared to normalize its relations with the United States. But 
if one wants to normalize relations, one cannot, of course, 
maintain a trade embargo, Allende points out. 
  Allende accuses the United States of manipulating and 
politicizing Cuba's emigrant and refugee affairs, which has not 
happened to any other Latin American country. On the basis of 
the treaty of 1984, the United States could grant as many as 
20,000 visas to Cubans a year. According to Allende, just over 
1,000 Cubans were granted a visa last year. Allende says the 
United States is using the matter to its political advantage. 
Visa applications are rejected, but at the same time the 
country receives all those who have left Cuba illegally. The 
Haitians' boats are turned back, but Cuban ferry people are 
granted a residence permit immediately. In Allende's view, much 
is spoken and written about these Cubans in Europe too, unlike 
for instance the Mexicans, the so-called wet backs, who seek to 
enter the United States illegally. The name wet back comes from 
the fact that when crossing the border river, the Mexicans get 
wet. 
  According to acting Foreign Minister Allende, the Cuban 
Government is prepared to improve relations between Cubans, but 
it presupposes one thing from its interlocutors: Opposition to 
the U.S. anti-Cuban policy and recognition of Cuba's 
sovereignty. At a recent meeting in Havana, some tangible 
results were achieved but it is still difficult to get close, 
Allende admits. 
  She cites an example. A Cuban lawyer, who attended the 
meeting, a U.S. citizen and member of the Democratic Party, at 
the final meeting thanked Fidel Castro for the conference and 
kissed him on the cheek. Back home in Miami, abuse and murder 
threats awaited the lawyer and her children, and the lawyer's 
car was smashed to pieces. 
  [Announcer] The acting Cuban Foreign Minister Isabel Allende 
is not the famous Chilean writer, nor is she the daughter of the 
former president of Chile, with whom she is often confused on 
account of her name.

  [Text] Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly 
of the People's Government, ANPP, has concluded a visit to the 
UK at the invitation of the British group of the 
Interparliamentary Union. In London, Alarcon met with numerous 
British parliamentarians on Cuba's current situation and on the 
particularities of its government system. Alarcon met Betty 
Boothroyd, president of the House of Commons, among other 
figures. 
  Alarcon began his visit to the UK on 23 May as head of a 
delegation that included Osvaldo Martinez, president of the ANPP 
Economic Commission, and Lidia Tablada, director of the National 
Center for Agricultural-Livestock Hygiene. The Cuban delegation 
led by Ricardo Alarcon also met UK authorities, including (David 
Hitchcock), the state minister of the Foreign Office. It was 
decided at the meeting that the British Government would send an 
official delegation to Cuba, to be led by (Patrick Glovlin), 
state minister for trade and technology and a participant of the 
meetings with Alarcon in London. 
  The Cuban parliamentary delegation also met British 
businessmen interested in maintaining and strengthening trade 
relations with Cuba. Coinciding with Alarcon's visit, Basic 
Industry Minister Marcos Portal was also in London and held 
several meetings with British businessmen.

<F P=106> [From the "Morning Information Review" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Army General Raul Castro, minister of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], has said unscrupulous 
individuals will not be allowed to divert and make use of the 
material results of the toil of selfless workers who comprise 
the Youth Labor Army [EJT]. Castro presided over the final event 
organized by the FAR General Staff for the EJT's Havana 
division, which was created nine months ago. 
  After analyzing the work done by the EJT, Gen. Castro 
praised 
these forces doing farm work in Havana, describing them as the 
pride of the country. In a brief statement during the final 
meeting, he supported a profound restructuring of the Ministry 
of Agriculture, which he said is the cause of inefficiency in 
state farms. Bureaucracy, he stressed, destroyed state 
agriculture. On this matter, he had words of praise for current 
Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan and added that he is certain 
Jordan will successfully carry out the task of bringing more 
products to the market. The EJT is a group within the FAR 
devoted to work in the agricultural and livestock sector, and 
since its founding 21 years ago [as heard] has became the most 
productive of the entire country. 
  [Editorial note: Mexico City NOTIMEX at 1840 GMT on 26 May 
carries a report citing the remarks by Gen. Raul Castro, as 
reported by Cuban daily GRANMA. Castro is cited as urging the 
EJT members to implement "new formulas" to eliminate 
shortcomings, negligence, red tape, and theft. He is also cited 
as saying that enforcement measures will implemented "within the 
law."]

  [Text] Havana, 24 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the Cuban Foreign 
Ministry favorably reacted to an official U.S. report 
acknowledging the struggle the Havana Government has been waging 
against drug trafficking. Miguel Alfonso, a Cuban Foreign 
Ministry spokesman, referring to the U.S. State Department 
report issued last week, told the media: "It is belated, but we 
welcome it." 
  The spokesman said the Foreign Ministry does not yet have 
any 
official analysis of the document, which is being analyzed by 
the Directorate of Multilateral Affairs. Alfonso announced, 
though, that this "recognition" of Cuba's official policy for 
the control of drug trafficking "is somewhat belated." 
  The U.S. State Department report pointed out "efforts the 
Cuban Government has made to prevent drug trafficking in its 
territorial waters and air space." The document also praised 
the steps the Caribbean nation has taken in this direction and 
noted that Cuban authorities have reinforced their antidrug 
trafficking struggle. The Cuban spokesman stated: "Our 
government's policy on the struggle against drug trafficking is 
long-lived."

  [Text] Hector Rosada Granados, president of the Guatemalan 
Government's Peace Commission, said on 25 May that the outcome 
of the recently concluded round of negotiations cannot be called 
negative, and that if an agreement was not reached or signed, it 
is only because the topic is a very complex one. 
  In a statement made at La Aurora International Airport upon 
his return from Mexico City, Rosada explained that the parties 
believed it was necessary to discuss the topic further, because 
it involves a situation that must be analyzed thoroughly. 
  Rosada added that the discussion of the topic will conclude 
the week of 30 May since the parties have agreed to meet again 
for two more days. The dates and location have not been 
disclosed since they are still awaiting the summoning of UN 
Moderator Jean Arnault. 
  As for the reason the negotiation was stalled, Rosada 
refused 
to comment because since the talks are not over he could not 
make a public statement in this regard. However, Rosada did not 
deny that the reason for the delay in the talks might be linked 
to the Army high command stating that they plan to have command 
posts in the region of Ixcan, Quiche. 
  Regarding an increase in military activity by the Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity, Rosada indicated that it 
contradicts the goal of negotiating a peace agreement. Rosada 
noted that it is not logical to sit at a negotiation table while 
engaging in violent actions. 
  This belligerent conduct will compel the state to take 
similar actions to counter the aggression. Any such actions by 
the government will be justifiable and impending because it is 
part of the government's constitutional mandate, Rosada 
concluded.

  [Text] The National Guatemalan Revolutionary Unity [URNG] 
yesterday blamed the Guatemalan Government's "lack of goodwill" 
for the failure of the round of negotiations that concluded in 
Puebla, Mexico, yesterday. 
  Miguel Sandoval, member of the URNG's diplomatic team, 
criticized the government delegation for "trying to evade the 
negotiation, rejecting the civilian society's position, and 
refusing to discuss in Oslo immediately the creation of a Truth 
Commission." 
  In a communique transmitted to this newspaper, the CERIGUA 
News Agency quotes Sandoval and describes as "tense" the meeting 
that closed yesterday without agreements and in which the Army, 
the government, and the rebels held contradictory positions on 
the displaced population subject. According to CERIGUA, another 
point of disagreement was the government's intention to center 
the discussion on a cease-fire, which contradicts the already 
signed agreements, rather than the proposals of the sectors 
involved, proposals outlined in a Civilian Sectors Assembly 
document.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 26 May (ACAN-EFE) -- The Honduran Armed 
Forces will continue to implement a plan to gradually reduce its 
military units due to "the lack of economic resources," Defense 
Minister General Reynaldo Andino Flores announced today. 
  The Army will dismantle artillery, armored cavalry, and 
infantry units due to lack of operating budget, based on a plan 
drafted in 1989. The Armed Forces eliminated a battalion of 
territorial forces and an artillery brigade in 1992, "and we are 
going to continue with the reductions due to the current crisis 
in the country," Andino said without giving specific numbers. 
  The armored battalion, which has approximately 50 British 
and 
Israeli-made tanks and armored vehicles will be part of a single 
military unit to be installed at the Nicaraguan border, in the 
southern part of the country. A communications battalion 
currently stationed near Tegucigalpa will be merged with an 
infantry unit in the eastern part of the country. The Honduran 
Armed Forces are made up of approximately 24,000 soldiers, 
including at least 6,000 policemen. 
  Gen. Andino said the gradual reduction plan began five years 
ago. The military budget totals 270 million lempiras (a little 
over $37 million) and according to Gen. Luis Alonso Discua, 
commander in chief of the Armed Forces, it has been reduced 10 
percent more. 
  During the eighties, the Army received approximately $500 
million in U.S. military aid. The United States also armed the 
Nicaraguan "contras" in an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the 
Nicaraguan Sandinist Government from eastern Honduras. U.S. 
military aid, however, was drastically reduced in the nineties 
and currently amounts to less than $1.5 million.

<F P=106> [Report by Carlos Mauricio Flores] </F>
  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- National Congress deputies yesterday 
approved a resolution permitting the Banco Central de Honduras 
[BCH] to auction off exchange as a means of stabilizing the 
lempira. The resolution compels assembly plants to sell to 
authorized exchange brokers the dollars needed for financing 
costs and operational expenses. 
  The Finance Ministry forwarded this proposal to Congress on 
Wednesday. The proposal suggests amending Article 1 of the Law 
on the Entry of U.S. Dollars From Exports because in the past 
few weeks there has been a tendency toward a rapid depreciation 
of the national currency caused mainly by speculation. 
  The congressional session was attended by BCH President Hugo 
Noe Pino, who briefed the deputies on the purpose of the measure 
and the BCH's reasons for it. U.S. dollars have been exchanged 
on the black market in several industrial zones, thus 
contributing to speculation's harmful effects. 
  Pino said the aggregate value of the assembly plants 
fluctuates between $70 million and $100 million. When 
corporations need lempiras, they have been exchanging some of 
this amount on the black market rather than through registered 
brokers. 
  It was reported that the changes are aimed at eliminating 
legal obstacles so that if necessary the BCH can auction U.S. 
dollars for as long as deemed advisable to try and stabilize the 
lempira, a mechanism that has been used in other countries with 
satisfactory results. 
  Article 1 used to forbid the BCH to auction U.S. dollars. 
But the amendment permits use of this instrument of monetary 
policy. 
  The amended article states: Foreign exchange from exports is 
a national economic property. Persons or legal entities that 
export goods must report to the BCH in advance every export, the 
amount, value, and destination of the goods to be exported, the 
probable date of the export, and the type of currency in which 
payment will be received. 
  "Export of goods originating in free zones, industrial zones 
of processing for export, retail exports, and those made by 
assembly plants according to the regulation of this law shall be 
excepted. Nevertheless, the foreign exchange transacted by 
persons or legal entities in free zones or industrial processing 
zones, including operators and assembly plants, to defray costs 
or expenses in local currency, will have to comply with BCH 
instructions." 
  At the outset, Carlos Kattan, National Party deputy for 
Cortes Department, who almost never attends congressional 
sessions, opposed a proposal to exchange foreign currency 
through brokers, who would then report to the BCH. Arguing for 
his position, Kattan said this procedure scares away investors 
because it could be regarded as state interventionism. 
  The motion was ultimately withdrawn. Congress President 
Carlos Flores Facusse said that this measure will help stabilize 
local currency.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 26 May (NOTIMEX) -- Honduras will 
officially join the Nonaligned Movement (NAM) on 30 May, Foreign 
Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar confirmed today. In remarks to 
NOTIMEX, Paz explained that Honduras was not allowed into the 
NAM during the past decade, when the country served as a base of 
operations for the Nicaraguan contras who were fighting the 
Sandinist regime. The official indicated that the nonaligned 
countries agreed to let Honduras join its ranks in the wake of 
the inauguration of President Carlos Roberto Reina, who is 
regarded as a leader of social democratic ideas and defender of 
human rights. 
  Paz, who will be the first Honduran foreign minister to 
participate in a meeting of that organization, said that he will 
attend the NAM conference with an "optimistic" attitude and that 
the conference will be held from 30 May to 6 June in Cairo, 
Egypt. 
  He added that he will attend the meeting with confidence 
that 
the new realities ruling the world will provide just and 
equitable participation to the Third World countries in that 
international movement.

<F P=106> [Report by Alfonso Malespin Jiron] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal has confirmed that the 
United States has asked the Nicaraguan Government to allow the 
entry of some of the thousands of Haitians who are fleeing the 
reign of terror in their country. The minister explained that 
the U.S. State Department made the same request of all Central 
American countries. 
  "We have received a note asking us to welcome Haitians. The 
request is being studied," he said, while explaining that 
Nicaragua is a country with too many problems relating to 
poverty and social instability. 
  Ramiro Gurdian, the president of the Higher Council of 
Private Enterprise (COSEP), astonished upon learning of the 
offer, asked: "What are we to do with them?" 
  Gurdian said he believes the Haitians are fleeing their 
country in search of work and in order to escape the insecure 
situation in which they live. 
  Gurdian expressed his assurance that "there are no 
incentives 
in Nicaragua. Perhaps the U.S. Government could finance 
projects in exchange for our accepting them. We do not really 
know what is behind all this." 
  The business leader concluded by saying that "it would be a 
problem for them to come into the country, because we have no 
sources for jobs." Nevertheless, the foreign minister announced 
that the Clinton administration's petition is being studied by 
President Violeta Chamorro. 
  Vilma Nunez, director of the Nicaraguan Human Rights Center 
(Cenidh), said that by accepting the Haitian refugees "from a 
humanitarian standpoint, Nicaragua would regain its status as a 
sanctuary nation." 
  But Nunez added that "from a realistic standpoint, the 
country is in no condition to accept the refugees, unless they 
bring their own bread." 
  "I do not think it would do any good to send refugees to a 
country that lacks the appropriate conditions, where they would 
be cast aside, humiliated, and discriminated against, and where 
they would go hungry," Nunez argued. 
  Attorney Alejandro Bravo contended that "if I were a Haitian 
I would not set sail for Nicaragua. It would be going from bad 
to worse." 
  He added that the U.S. Government looks upon Haitians as 
scum 
because they speak no English, they are black, and they are 
unskilled. Therefore, their logic is that "there is nothing 
better than to send them to another country that they also 
regard as scum." 
  Oscar Tellez, an attorney and former Nicaraguan ambassador 
to 
the Dominican Republic, agreed with accepting Haitian refugees 
in coordination with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
(ACNUR). 
<H5>  Criticism in CODEHUCA </H5>
  But he noted that "this would have to be done in conjunction 
with a great effort by all Central America directed at getting 
Bertrand Aristide back into power. Until now, the OAS and the 
United States have had a weak position on the government of 
Raoul Cedras." 
  Abel Santamaria, secretary general of the National 
Federation 
of Associations of Public Employees of Panama, called the U.S. 
request "inhumane" and added that it demonstrates the lack of 
compassion and real democracy on the part of the United States. 
Santamaria is attending the forum organized by the Commission 
for the Defense of Human Rights in Central America [CODEHUCA]. 
  It is the United States and the economic measures it has 
applied through international financial organizations that is 
preventing poor countries, like those in Central America, from 
attaining a balanced development. This now is a compassionless 
measure that violates human rights, he criticized. 
  Meanwhile, Carmen Caney, a member of the Guatemalan 
delegation participating in the human rights forum, added that 
it is inhumane for the United States to discriminate against the 
Haitians fleeing their country. 
  The Guatemalan delegate pointed out that "the majority are 
black, for which they are discriminated against. This is also 
discrimination against the poor countries, which already are 
facing enormous economic problems." She concluded that "besides 
being discriminatory, then, this measure will only worsen our 
own problems."

  [Text] The Legislative Assembly yesterday approved the full 
Drug Law aimed at combating drug trafficking. This law provides 
judicial ruling for attention to drug addicts who, instead of 
prison terms, will be provided with rehabilitation. This will 
be an obligation of the Nicaraguan State. 
  The law, approved by a majority of votes, provides that 
those 
who are not authorized to cultivate or harvest seeds or plants 
from which psychotropic substances are obtained will be punished 
with a prison term ranging from three to 12 years and a 
3,000-50,000-cordoba fine. 
  The legislation provides sentences for those who stock drugs 
as well as for those who promote and encourage their 
consumption. The sentence could be increased up to double for 
those who induce minors. The deputies fixed sentences that 
range from 15-30 years and fines of up to 5 million cordobas for 
drug trafficking chiefs. 
  Deputy Doris Tijerino, president of the parliamentary drug 
committee, said that the law provides for light sentences for 
those who, because of necessity, become victims of drugs, while 
she reiterated the state's obligation to arrange for the 
rehabilitation of drug addicts. The deputy gave as an example 
(with regard to the fines that drug traffickers should pay) that 
the fines imposed by the police are serving to improve the 
salaries of the police officers who earn meager salaries. 
  The Assembly resolved that the fines collected by the state 
for drug-related crimes should be allocated to the 
rehabilitation of drug addicts and that these fines should be 
heavy when it is a matter of individuals who obtain economic 
benefits through trafficking. 
  As of 1990, Nicaragua started to become a sort of 
"springboard" or "transfer" [preceding word in English] of 
cocaine from the south, by South American drug cartels. This 
situation has put on alert the government, the community, and 
the very legislators even though the police force -- with the 
support of the DEA -- has staged significant drug busts on 
Nicaraguan territory. 
  Nongovernmental organizations that give attention to persons 
addicted to drugs such as cocaine, crack, marijuana, and others, 
have indicated that in our country there are approximately 
300,000 persons who consume diverse types of drugs.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Plan Is Reportedly To `Clean Up His </F>
Image' as a Candidate; Sergio Ramirez' Expulsion, A Trick?"] 
  [Text] The so-called "hardline" of the FSLN [Sandinist 
National Liberation Front], which emerged the winner in the 
party's special congress, is also seeking to topple Dr. Sergio 
Ramirez as leader of the parliamentarian bloc. Monica 
Baltodano, after being elected a member of the National 
Directorate, said that "some decisions regarding the operation 
of the Sandinist bloc will be made." 
  Baltodano, who is characterized by maintaining radical 
positions, added that the congress did not discuss a motion 
making "the Sandinist Assembly the body responsible for 
appointing the head of the Sandinist bloc." Baltodano said that 
"the head of the Sandinist bloc should be a member of the 
National Directorate [DN]." Ramirez, the current bloc leader, 
was purged from the DN. 
  Rumors that the removal of Ramirez from the DN could be just 
another Sandinist trick to "clean his image" to be a 
presidential candidate intensified today. If he wins, Daniel 
Ortega and his people would join Ramirez in sharing power as in 
the eighties. The two Sandinist newspapers today redoubled 
their support for Dr. Ramirez despite his defeat in the party's 
internal elections, and this seems to be a significant 
development. 
  Dr. Ramirez, who headed a current that opposed Ortega, 
tendered his resignation yesterday to the plenary of the 
Sandinist parliamentarian bloc, but it was not accepted. "We 
rejected Ramirez' resignation and ratified him unanimously," 
said Dora Maria Tellez during a news conference. 
  Sandinist sociologist and economist Oscar Rene Vargas told 
BARRICADA yesterday that there will reportedly be purges within 
the FSLN. Vargas quoted "Democratic Left" spokesman Julio Lopez 
as saying that the following will be purged: BARRICADA Director 
Carlos Fernando Chamorro, EL NUEVO DIARIO Deputy Director Dr. 
Danilo Aguirre Solis, and Sandinist bloc leader Dr. Sergio 
Ramirez. Alejandro Serrano Caldera, rector of the UNAN [National 
Autonomous University of Nicaragua], will reportedly be replaced 
by Javier Pichardo. 
  "The appointment of the Sandinist bloc leader has so far 
been 
an internal election," Baltadano said, suggesting that the 
Sandinist Assembly will intervene in the affairs of her party's 
parliamentarian bloc. "If the Sandinist Assembly has received 
the mandate of electing, from among DN members, the secretary 
for organization and the secretary for international relations 
and propaganda, with much added reason the Sandinist Assembly 
will have a much greater role in the leadership of the Sandinist 
bloc," she added. 
  William Ramirez said yesterday, during a news conference in 
which Sergio Ramirez was ratified as bloc leader, that the bloc 
has its own internal rules. "There is no need to be a member of 
the DN or member of the Sandinist Assembly to become bloc chief, 
deputy chief, or member of a bloc committee," William Ramirez 
added. He pointed out that Dr. Sergio Ramirez was not a DN 
member when he became leader of the parliamentarian bloc. 
  At the special congress, Sergio Ramirez followers obtained 
30 
percent of the Congress delegates' votes compared to an 
overwhelming 70 percent obtained by Ortega's supporters.

<F P=106> [By Jorge Katin] </F>
  [Text] In her first statements to the media minutes after 
being elected to the National Directorate [DN] of the FSLN 
[Sandinist National Liberation Front], Commander Monica 
Baltodano called for editorial changes in BARRICADA. 
  She thinks that following its Congress the FSLN "has an 
opportunity to draft a better program for the 1996 elections. 
We now have all the necessary elements for establishing a new 
party that will create more democratic possibilities." 
Baltodano added, however, that the idea is not to subtract from 
but to add to the party. 
  When asked about the possible removal of certain cadres from 
the party, Monica Baltodano admitted that there will be "some 
separations, but only of mid-level cadres, not of national 
figures." 
  "Any defeat involves frustrations and negative responses," 
Baltodano noted. She added that the group which until yesterday 
was called Current of the Majorities suffered "a political 
defeat." 
  Baltodano rejected any possibility of implementing a policy 
of "revenge" against those she termed political losers. "If we 
were not vengeful toward the Somozist guardsmen, how can we be 
vengeful against companeros in our own ranks?" 
<H5>  The Media </H5>
  Baltadano said the ambiguous ownership of certain media such 
as Radio Ya and Canal Cuatro will be among the topics discussed 
at the new Sandinist Assembly. 
  Reporter William Roiz asked Baltodano whether there will be 
changes in BARRICADA. She replied: "Definitely, because most 
of the new DN members think BARRICADA's editorial policy should 
be changed. We will discuss it in the next few days, but by no 
means are we talking about a sweep." 
  [BARRICADA Director] Carlos Fernando Chamorro was on Canal 
Dos' "Good Morning" program yesterday, and a viewer called to 
ask about his possible dismissal in view of Baltadano's 
statements. 
  "Is that the democracy of Sandinism you have spoken about?" 
the viewer asked. 
  Chamorro replied that he had not heard Baltodano's 
statements 
so he could not answer the question. "I refuse to believe this 
is true. But if it is, the alleged unity and democracy 
proclaimed at the Congress would be a complete farce," he added. 
  Chamorro admitted, however, that there are profound 
differences of opinion about the media. "Some think that 
newspapers such as BARRICADA should be para-partisan 
[parapartidario] instruments of power subject to the party's 
control. I think BARRICADA is a democratic newspaper that has 
gained broad credibility in this country and that it must endure 
without becoming a propaganda tool again," he added. 
<H5>  Doris Tijerino Speaks Out </H5>
  Doris Tijerino, who was not elected to the DN despite having 
been nominated by nearly all departments, said the Congress 
achieved some important things, including electing women to 30 
percent of the positions and a high Atlantic Coast 
representation. 
  "Most importantly, for the first time there were currents 
with different positions voicing their views. This had never 
happened in the FSLN before, but that doesn't mean the unity was 
broken," Tijerino said. She added that more needs to be done in 
terms of tolerance of political ideas. 
  As for her exclusion from the DN, Tijerino said the Congress 
delegates were not wearing a straitjacket, and although much was 
said about respecting the results of consultations with the rank 
and file, "the decisions of the Congress are sovereign, and I 
respect them." 
  Contrary to Baltodano's claim that one current dealt a 
"political defeat" to another, Tijerino said that "when two 
different ideas clash within a party, the goal is to find the 
truth, not to defeat each other. Commander Baltodano's 
assessment was wrong," Tijerino added.

<F P=106> [By Noel Irias] </F>
  [Text] Fernando Cardenal, a member of the Sandinist 
Assembly, said yesterday that "imposing an editorial line on 
BARRICADA would be a serious setback to the FSLN [Sandinist 
National Liberation Front] and the country's democratization 
process." 
  Cardenal said the newspaper's editorial line offered broad 
opportunities for debate among Sandinists before the Congress, 
and "everyone who wanted to express his views was able to do so." 
  "BARRICADA reported the debate in a serious, broad, and 
ethical way. Its work was serious and responsible," Cardenal 
stressed. 
  According to former Education Minister Cardenal, divisions 
result when there is no opportunity for debate. "As long as 
there is debate, there is less of a chance of divisions," he 
commented. 
  "I think BARRICADA gained prestige because of its 
credibility. Ambassadors and foreign personalities have told me 
that BARRICADA is the most serious, responsible, and trustworthy 
newspaper in the country. 
  Cardenal, who stressed that he was speaking as a Sandinist, 
not as a member of any group or tendency, noted that no group 
should fall to the temptation to impose its authority on other 
members. 
  "Authority is not imposed by force. Ideas are imposed by the 
force of their truth and conviction," he said. 
  Jose Gonzalez, FSLN political secretary in Matagalpa and 
member of the Sandinist Assembly, stressed that the mandate 
received at the FSLN Congress was unity and that his party 
cannot "afford to change cadres with great experience as if they 
could be discarded." 
  "In the case of BARRICADA, it is not a matter of going back 
and making it what it used to be during the revolutionary 
government, when it was an appendage of the DAP [Agitation and 
Propaganda Department], DOR [Department of Organization and 
Masses], and DEP [Department for Propaganda and Political 
Education]. Anyone who thinks that way is mistaken. We must 
open more opportunities for all sectors so they can express 
their views," Gonzalez said. 
  He added: "We know that newspapers must compete for readers 
and publicity. A media that speaks only for the FSLN is not 
feasible. BARRICADA must express the people's feelings. It 
should be objective and maintain a balance. It should reflect 
the criteria of workers, the private sector, the government, and 
grass roots organizations." 
  On possible changes in BARRICADA's editorial line, Gonzalez 
said it should be discussed at the Sandinist Assembly but that 
the discussion should be frank, sincere, and two-way. 
<H5>  Seeking Balance </H5>
  Deputy Natan Sevilla said that BARRICADA, as a newspaper 
organically linked to the FSLN, "should transcend the daily 
pulse of debates, where there are occasional attacks from one 
side or the other." 
  "If one of the FSLN's objectives is preparing for the 1996 
elections, BARRICADA can contribute significantly toward placing 
the Sandinist overall political interests in the forefront and 
leave less opportunity for quarrels," he said. 
  "That is why some people criticize BARRICADA, saying that it 
favors one side over the other. We must balance opinions," 
Sevilla said.

  [Text] Managua, 28 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Managua's Radio 
Catolica executives reported today that unidentified persons 
stole station transmitter equipment and spares, "leaving it off 
the air" for an undetermined amount of time. The station is 
owned by the Managua Archbishopric. 
  The thiefs "took several spares and an FM link used for 
normal broadcasts," the source added, after reporting that the 
theft took place at the transmitter site in the southeast 
outskirts of Managua. 
  The police have already been notified of the incident and 
have initiated the pertinent investigations, said one of 
"Catolica's" board members, but he did not disclose the value of 
the stolen equipment. 
  Radio Catolica is owned by the Nicaraguan Episcopal 
Conference, whose president is Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo.

<F P=106> [Article by Telma Luzzani] </F>
  [Text] Bluntly saying "Russia does not want the Black Sea 
fleet to be split," Russian Federation Council President 
Vladimir Shumeyko summarized the Russian stance on its current 
dispute with Ukraine, the most serious between the two nuclear 
powers after the dissolution of the former Soviet Union. 
  Visiting Argentina within the framework of a Latin American 
tour that also includes Chile, Brazil, Venezuela, and Ecuador, 
Shumeyko ruled out the possibility of any armed confrontation 
between Russia and Ukraine despite last week's crisis in Crimea. 
  Asked during a news conference in Buenos Aires about the 
Kremlin's possible reaction to an armed effort by Kiev to quench 
Crimea's efforts to achieve independence, Shumeyko responded: 
"I do not believe Ukraine will use force." 
  [CLARIN] Why? 
  [Shumeyko] Because it is impossible. 
  It is simply impossible, the senator emphasized. He made it 
clear he is making this tour as a representative of the Russian 
state and not as a representative of the Senate alone. 
  [CLARIN] Should Crimea be Russian? 
  [Shumeyko] Neither Russian nor Ukrainian. I believe it is 
necessary to focus on the basics of the problem. Nowadays, 
Russia is economically better off than Ukraine. For Crimea to 
become Russian territory is tantamount to becoming subordinate 
to a stronger currency, earning higher wages, and enjoying other 
benefits. We respect Ukraine's sovereignty and the Ukrainian 
people's desire to organize their own lives. Nowadays, Russian 
support for Crimean authorities is economic. The rest depends 
on Ukraine's stance. 
  [CLARIN] The true issue under discussion involves the 
Sebastopol base and the Black Sea fleet, but the negotiations on 
splitting are bogged down. What is likely to happen? 
  [Shumeyko] Russia does not want the fleet to be split. The 
politicians now are playing this card, but they are aware of the 
fact that the problem does not involve the fleet's command but 
its existence. Neither Russia nor Ukraine is able to separately 
maintain such a powerful fleet. 
  [CLARIN] Concerning Russian domestic politics, the unending 
disputes between groups struggling for and against the reforms 
frequently jeopardize Russia's frail democratic stability. What 
is the current situation? 
  [Shumeyko] I would say now there are no sharp disputes at 
the domestic political level. I believe rather that both the 
conservatives and the reformists have changed to such an extent 
that now it is difficult to clearly distinguish who is who. For 
example, the communists accept private property and religion. 
In today's Russia, we might say there is not a single true 
communist, but there is not a single true democrat either. 
Except for the extremists, everyone agrees that the reforms 
must be carried out. 
  [CLARIN] And Zhirinovskiy? 
  [Shumeyko] Zhirinovskiy too. Of course, with his own 
interpretation. We require stability in order to implement the 
reforms. Therefore, President Boris Yeltsin proposed signing a 
national consensus agreement to strengthen the Russian state.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 26 May (NA) -- In connection with a 
Chilean map that shows serious irregularities which was 
published by a Buenos Aires morning newspaper, the Foreign 
Ministry stated today that "there is no border conflict between 
Argentina and Chile." 
  According to Argentine officials, the map was published in 
black and white "without showing the colored areas and without 
the explanatory notes of the original, thus making a serious 
mistake in its interpretation." 
  In a communique, the Foreign Ministry assures that the map 
published with the report was taken "from a chart in the `Atlas 
of Chilean History,' by Osvaldo Silva, published by Editorial 
Universitaria in 1992." 
  The communique says: "The original clearly shows areas on 
the 
map as Argentine territory assigned to Chile. These are the 
territories that were `stripped' from Chile as of 1563 until the 
end of the 19th century when new viceregal jurisdictions and 
border treaties were implemented." 
  It makes clear: "The original map entails no claim by Chile 
to any current Argentine territory." 
  The Foreign Ministry emphasizes that "there is no border 
dispute" between the two countries, and that of the 24 pending 
border issues that remained unresolved until 1991, "22 were 
settled through a bilateral agreement that was signed that year." 
  The two remaining issues, Laguna del Desierto and the 
continental glacier zone, are being considered by the two 
Congresses.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 27 May (NA) -- The Foreign Ministry 
reported today that two Argentine citizens are being held 
"hostage" in the Techint Company offices in the Bolivian town of 
Camiri which has been blocked as part of a civic strike over 
salary hike demands. 
  The Argentine citizens are engineers Jose Gasparoni and Juan 
Quevedo. The Argentine Foreign Ministry is conducting intense 
negotiations with the Bolivian Government over Gasparoni and 
Quevedo. 
  In this regard, Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella called his 
Bolivian counterpart to personally inquire about the situation 
of these two citizens while the Foreign Ministry has called the 
Techint Company in our country and is calling the engineers' 
relatives.

  [Excerpts] Ushuaia, 27 May (NA) -- Tierra del Fuego 
Governor Jose Estabillo (MOPOF) [Tierra del Fuego Popular 
Movement] emphasized today that "there is no chance of a social 
explosion" in the province. He said the conflict that provoked 
the mobilization of hundreds of metalworkers will be resolved 
before 30 May. 
  Estabillo said: "We do not have 1,700 people thrown into the 
streets as some newspapers said." The governor recognized, 
however, that "there is a problem, but it is limited to two or 
three companies." 
  He said: "Workers and managers are discussing the situation. 
The government is mediating, doing its best to find a solution." 
  The governor added that the metalworkers "did not respect 
the 
order of compulsory conciliation decreed by the Labor Ministry," 
after the Ushuaia Branch of the UOM [Metalworkers Union] decided 
to stage an indefinite strike. [passage omitted] 
  Estabillo recognized: "The climate in the province is tense" 
because the factory sector is very important -- it employs 
nearly 5,500 people, adding that "other supporters gradually 
joined the demonstration." 
  Regarding the case of workers who took over a factory, 
Estabillo said: "This incident involved the Crown company 
following the dismissal of 15 workers." The governor urged 
workers to respect a court ruling. 
  Estabillo said that despite the important increase in 
production of color television sets -- from 300,000 sets in 1990 
to 1,600,000 last year -- there is a crisis in the industry due 
to "commercial factors and the increased demand during the run 
up to the world soccer competition, which is not up to 
entrepreneurs' expectations." 
  Estabillo said: "Entrepreneurs have complained about the 
policy permitting the unrestricted import of electronic 
products, which is producing strong competition for national 
industries in Tierra del Fuego." 
  The governor added: "Industrial retooling takes time and 
effort," stressing "the political willingness of the economy 
minister to change the tax burden on Tierra del Fuego 
entrepreneurs." 
  The governor denied asking the Border Police to intervene, 
assuring that "the situation is being controlled by the 
provincial police."

  [Text] Ushuaia (DYN-NA) -- At least nine people were 
seriously injured yesterday and scores arrested after police 
clashed violently with groups of workers at the local Crown 
Mustang electronics factory, where workers have been on strike 
for 12 days in protest against a series of labour disputes. 
  The trouble was sparked off in the early hours of yesterday 
morning when police moved in to the electronics factory and 
tried to evict them and a number of reporters by force. 
  Among those seriously injured were at least five workers 
from 
the firm and four reporters. As many as 20 other workers were 
said to have received minor injuries. 
  Although police denied there had been any arrests, reporters 
said there had been several and that other people had been 
forced to hand over identity documents. 
  Witnesses told reporters that police had been firing guns 
amid the rioting and hitting workers with truncheons as the 
trouble flared. 
  Workers had occupied the offices of the Crown Mustang 
building for nearly two weeks in protest against low salaries 
and redundancies. Fifteen workers at the firm and a further 120 
at Continental Fueguina were laid off last week. 
  UOM metal workers union representative Oscar Martinez said 
the repression had been "absolutely terrible" and that police 
had "chased workers along the streets for at least ten blocks. 
  "One man had his head split open by a stick smashed over his 
head by police," Martinez said. "Another was shot in the arm 
while another was kicked while on the ground." 
  A statement, issued by Tierra del Fuego Government Minister 
Fulvio Baseda, said that the violent eviction order had been 
ordered by Judge Fernando Machado after workers had refused to 
stop their strike late Friday evening. 
  Moments later in direct contradiction to the statement, 
Tierra del Fuego Governor Jose Strabillo, who had said Friday 
that the strikes would not lead to violence, said that the 
police action had been wholly justified: "They (the police) were 
merely carrying out their legal orders." 
  "On arrival (at the factory) they were hit by stones and 
home-made bombs that were being thrown out of the windows of the 
factory by the workers," the governor said. 
  Yet Strabillo's deputy, Miguel Angel Castro, told reporters 
later in the evening that there would be an immediate 
independent investigation in order to determine whether the 
police had in any way abused their authority. 
  He also said police had been ordered to move in given that 
the workers had "illegally invaded what constitutes private 
property." 
  As a result of the clashes, which workers said had been on 
the cards ever since the government ordered a detachment of 
Border Guards to the province last week supposedly to curb any 
hints of violence, there will be a general strike tomorrow as a 
further mark of protest. 
  Union leaders also refused to rule out further collective 
action in the latter parts of next week. 
  Local reporters said the police had also cordoned off the 
local FM Fuego radio station and fired rifle shots at its 
offices, forcing the station to close down for some three hours. 
  Hours after the turmoil, witnesses said there was still 
tension between the public and police as a series of marches 
were being held through the streets with approximately 800 
people participating. 
  The decision to strike was voted for unanimously by members 
of the local branches of the UOM metal workers union, the ATSA 
health workers union as well as members of the restaurant and 
oil workers union. 
  Employees at local-based companies have been demanding wage 
hikes for two years in order to compensate for living in one of 
the most expensive provinces in the country. 
  Labour Minister Armando Caro Figueroa and Interior Minister 
Carlos Ruckauf were originally due to visit the province 
tomorrow in an attempt to pacify workers and bring the situation 
back to normal. There was no immediate statement as to whether 
the plans would still be enforced. 
  Meanwhile Ruckauf said last night that the government was 
not 
planning to revert to intervention in an attempt to bring order 
to the troubled zone. 
  "It's not even a remote possibility," the minister said. "It 
would only be considered if the local government pleaded for 
such a step or if the police forces were out of their depth." 
  He added that although the government and security services 
would continue to monitor the developments in the province 
closely, they would respect the workers' right to strike. 
  Ruckauf emphasized that the Border Guards stationed nearby 
were on alert and that the government would not hesitate to 
dispatch them to the scene of the disturbances if the situation 
gets out of hand over the next few days.

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 27 May (NA) -- President Carlos 
Menem implicitly supported the implementation of a clause making 
it possible for governors to be reelected when he said that the 
provincial constitutions "should be entirely in accordance" with 
the terms of the national Constitution. 
  The president's words are a renewed support to the plans of 
certain governors, Buenos Aires Governor Eduardo Duhalde among 
them, who hope the Constituent Assembly approves a clause 
enabling them to become gubernatorial candidates in 1995, even 
if their districts prevent them from being reelected. 
  In remarks made to "La 9.90" radio station on the night of 
26 
May, Menem again denied rumors that he was seriously ill. He 
called for "an end to this irresponsible behavior, because 
spreading this sort of rumor shows no love for the country or 
its people." [passage omitted] 
  Commenting on the Olivos Pact, he rejected the idea of a 
"package." He pointed out that "it is a law, part of which has 
been agreed upon," and declined "to make further comments 
because now it is the Constituent Assembly members' turn to talk 
about it." 
  He also expressed support for a possible reelection of 
governors because "four provinces have the possibility of 
reelecting their governors and this unequal treatment of the 
issue is repugnant to the national Constitution." 
  He emphasized: "There are no grounds, no reasons to oppose 
the governors' reelection. We cannot forget that if we look at 
the issue from the philosophical point of view, the provincial 
constitutions must be entirely in accordance with the terms of 
the national Constitution." 
  Menem believes the reelection issue is not a matter of form 
but of essence because "it grants all citizens an equal right to 
be elected and reelected." 
  Asked whether Duhalde could run for the vice presidency if 
prevented from being reelected governor, Menem answered "of 
course he can." He added that it was "a lie" that Economy 
Minister Domingo Cavallo might become "jealous" because of that. 
  He pointed out: "Cavallo is now less interested in entering 
the political area because he is doing very well in the economic 
area. He is a vigorous, somewhat passionate, man." 
  He added: "The important thing is that in the economic field 
things are well." He confirmed that "there is no possibility of 
modifying or violating the economic model that we have 
implemented." 
  Regarding disagreement created over the Secretariat for 
Community Protection, Menem regretted the fact that "some have 
exaggerated what has happened." He emphasized, however, that 
"the issue has been discussed and the river waters have returned 
to their course. The river is flowing slowly but uninterruptedly 
and no one is mentioning the topic now." 
  "I do not know where the rumors come from, but all I can 
tell 
these people is `those whom you have killed are in good health.' 
I have never felt better nor as full of enthusiasm for doing 
things for my country as now," Menem said denying rumors about 
health problems.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 27 May (NA) -- Raul Alfonsin, 
president of the Radical [Civic Radical Union] bloc of 
Constituent Assembly members, reiterated that his party 
"definitely" does not want the assembly to include a clause that 
will allow governors to run for reelection, and he reiterated 
that "ballotage is a Radical project that comes from 1988 and 
has been accepted by Carlos Menem." 
  Regarding the reelection of governors, he said: "The 
Constituent Assembly can in no way dedicate itself to this type 
of topic, and as of now we are not accepting any type of clause 
on this matter." 
  "This is the responsibility of provincial constitutions, and 
it cannot be discussed or debated in a constitutional reform, 
and we are maintaining this position," he added. 
  He also gave an advance warning about his "flat" refusal to 
the possibility of the existence a Lemas Law in Buenos Aires 
Province. 
  "In truth," he said, "the province's constitution makes its 
implementation very difficult, and there is no way in which the 
official sector can structure it." 
  Asked about the changes that occurred during the past 20 
years that could justify a new constitution, Alfonsin said that 
"there have been various events," and he highlighted "the role 
of the Armed Forces, which today is blended with the 
institutions." 
  He also maintained that after 10 years of exercising 
democracy "it is evident that it is not a good thing for the 
president to name judges," and therefore with the constitutional 
reform "this activity will be carried out by the Magistrates 
Council in order to serve the Republic's interests in a much 
better way."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 29 May (NA) -- The Defense Ministry's 
most immediate projects are the privatization of the San 
Francisco and Rio Tercero Military Factories and the Domingo 
Matheu Portable Weapons Factory; the liquidation of the company 
Tecnologia Aerospacial; and the franchising of airport auxiliary 
services. 
  The ministry headed by Oscar Camilion already has the 
feasibility study for the privatization of the company Aerea 
Material Cordoba, linked to airplane construction, which was 
produced by the Netherlands consulting firm ING Bank. 
  Also approved are the documents for the bidding and 
privatization of the San Francisco Military Factory in Cordoba 
Province. 
  The options for implementing this operation are two: selling 
the assets; or renting the installations for 10 years with a 
purchase option that includes the transfer of personnel. 
  According to the Economy Ministry's last report on 
privatizations, the Defense Ministry is analyzing the 
possibility of bidding the chemistry and metallurgical areas of 
the Rio Tercero Military Factory, and has already requested an 
evaluation of the installations' worth. 
  The privatization of the Domingo Matheu Portable Weapons 
Factory, through the sale of 75 percent of company shares, is 
ready. The factory has been transformed into a new shareholding 
company in order to implement the operation. 
  The proposal provides for the sale of another 20 percent of 
company shares in a second stage. Four percent of the shares 
will be used for the participating property program, and 1 
percent will remain in the hands of the state. 
  The Defense Ministry is also planning to liquidate the 
company Tecnologia Aeroespacial S.A., which is 99.96 percent 
state owned, as well as Sidinox, a company that is 50 percent 
owned by Acerinter S.A. 
  The ministry is also thinking of privatizing the Center for 
Mining and Geological Exploration and the Minister Manuel Garcia 
Shipyard. 
  The Defense Ministry has also proposed franchising the 
exploitation of the different units of the "Fanazul" Black 
Powder and Explosives Military Factory. Pending are measures 
for implementing the privatization of the companies Sisteval 
S.A., the Fray Luis Beltran Military Factory, the Villa Maria 
Explosives and Black Powder Military Factory, and Satecna S.A. 
  Finally, still pending is the project to deregulate airport 
auxiliary services -- customs clearing houses, ramp services, 
duty free shops -- in order to privatize them.

  [Text] President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares has 
expressed his agreement with the bill on constitutional 
amendments that President Guillermo Endara presented this week 
to the plenum of the Legislative Assembly. Those amendments 
include proscribing the army and giving the Electoral Tribunal 
(TE) more financial and administrative autonomy. 
  Perez Balladares pointed out the need to give the National 
Police a legal reference point for regulating that profession 
and the institution through constitutional means and thus 
eliminate all vestiges of the former National Guard from the 
Constitution. 
  "Preserving the Panamanian state's right to defend itself, 
we 
agree with eliminating all references in the constitution to the 
National Guard, an institution we will not allow to be 
resurrected," Perez Balladares added. 
  In the same manner, he said that it should be understood 
that 
the elimination of the national army is linked to the 
elimination of any other foreign army from our soil, this in 
reference to the Southern Command. 
  Perez Balladares also agreed with the proposed amendments 
granting the TE more administrative and economic autonomy. He 
stressed this is the only way to guarantee to the people that 
the 1999 elections will be as free and honest as the 8 May 1994 
elections. 
  Last Monday the Executive Branch, through Government 
Minister 
Jacobo Salas, presented two bills to the plenum of the 
Legislative Assembly on eliminating the Army from the 
Constitution and seeking autonomy for the TE to guarantee free, 
honest, and efficient elections. 
  Meanwhile, PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] Legislator 
Gerardo Gonzalez disagreed with the approval of those 
amendments, saying they are part of a "package" of 
constitutional amendments rejected in the latest referendum. 
  Perez Balladares, who will take office on 1 September, said 
that his administration's relations with the United States will 
not be affected by the death of U.S. soldier Zak Hernandez, 
because no crime has been confirmed. 
  Perez Balladares added that the Panamanian judicial system 
will be the only entity charged with clarifying that incident, 
which occurred on 10 June 1992, and that he will accept the 
decisions resulting from the investigations, without any foreign 
pressures. 
  Gerardo Gonzalez also said that the PRD will not approve 
constitutional amendments on electoral matters that do not have 
the consensus of various political groups and much less if they 
endanger the existence of small parties. 
  Gonzalez, who is also president of the PRD, said his party 
agrees completely with reforms giving the TE more autonomy but 
rejects changes to Article 141 of the Constitution with regard 
to the Legislative Assembly's configuration. 
  According to the proposed amendments to Article 141, members 
of the Legislative Assembly would be elected only for specific 
circuits [circuitos uninominales], which would exclude a 
proportional representation system that favors small parties. 
  "That change to Article 141 has not been discussed by the 
political parties. This is something unexpected that will cause 
problems in this legislative period and in the Assembly to be 
isntalled on 1 September," he stressed. 
  Gonzalez recalled that in 1983 the PRD recommended that the 
1984 elections be based on specific districts, but because of 
protests by representatives of small parties, the system of 
voting for a party slate [plurinominal] was instituted.

<F P=106> [By Jose Quintero De Leon] </F>
  [Text] Panama's President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares 
has told the media that Puerto Rican Governor Pedro Rosello 
promised him that his government will install soon in Panama a 
liaison office with the purpose to attract private investment to 
the isthmus. 
  Perez reported this at Marco A. Gelabert Airport on his 
return from the Antilliean island where he spent five days as 
guest of Governor Rosello, who was a schoolmate of his at a U.S. 
university. 
  During his stay in Puerto Rico, Perez also met with 
commercial and industrial groups of the island and spoke with 
them about the advantages Panama offers to foreign investors. 
  Perez said: "I hope we can dedicate that office soon and 
that 
it produces the effect we all expect." 
  The president elect also said that he spoke with Puerto 
Rican 
investors about the returned areas and the military 
installations that the U.S. southern Command will deliver to 
Panama in a few months. 
  In Perez Balladares' opinion, these installations can be 
used 
as complementary facilities and be turned into a door for the 
entrance and establishment of South American commerce in Panama. 
  Perez noted: "I think that we must reproduce the effort we 
are making in Puerto Rico in other countries of the world to 
establish in Panama marketing, export, and reexport centers that 
use the returned areas to create jobs we need, and at the same 
time take advantage of our geographic position." 
  Consulted about the reforms proposed by President Bill 
Clinton to restructure the Panama Canal Commission and about 
reforming the bank secrecy statutes to strengthen the antidrug 
struggle, Perez said he prefers to wait until his foreign 
minister-to-be gives him a well-founded report. 
  Perez said: "I would welcome, from any country, any joint 
effort initiative that, without hurting our interests, serves to 
check drug-trafficking and money-laundering." He noted that this 
is what his government will aim for and this is what President 
Clinton has referred to. 
  Regarding the Canal reforms, he said that Law 96-70 (the 
Murphy Law) requires modifications to permit the implementation 
of the final phase of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, "and I 
suppose that this is to what the reforms sent by President 
Clinton to the Senate refer." 
  Finally, Perez Balladares rejected speculation about Panama 
moving toward the category of a Free Associated State, like 
Puerto Rico, noting that Panamanians have chosen to remain as a 
free, independent, and sovereign republic, while Puerto Ricans 
decided to maintain their status. In this regard he said that he 
respects the idiosyncracy and autonomy of all nations.

<F P=106> [Report by Manuel Alvarez Cedeno] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Jose Mulino has said that it would 
be a serious mistake to renegotiate the presence of the United 
States in Panama after the year 2000 because the infrastructures 
now used in the Canal area must be put to work for the good of 
the country. 
  The Torrijos-Carter Treaties signed in 1977 state that the 
U.S. presence in Panama must end by 31 December 1999. 
  Mulino recalled that President Guillermo Endara's 
administration "has always said that there is no possibility of 
renegotiating the presence of U.S. bases in Panama after the 
year 2000." However, some groups in the country are suggesting 
the renegotiation of these treaties to avoid the negative impact 
that this withdrawal will have on the country's economy. 
  "As a Panamanian I have seen and studied in depth what the 
return of these infrastructures will represent for our country, 
socially as well as economically, and I believe it would be a 
mistake to suggest they remain here," Mulino said. 
  The Panamanian diplomat added that "we have to start 
working, 
as of yesterday, to efficiently and actively incorporate all 
those assets that the reverted areas represent to our national 
development." 
  Mulino said he believes Panama will benefit more from 
developing those areas in an organized way than by having them 
inhabited by foreign soldiers. 
  The areas along the banks of the Panama Canal are worth 
approximately $30 billion, and, according to economists, they 
must be used to create jobs through foreign investment. 
  Mulino said that "as a citizen, this is the view that I must 
support." 
  However, Mulino added that it will be up to President-elect 
Ernesto Perez Balladares and Foreign Minister-elect Gabriel 
Lewis Galindo to deal with this matter. 
  Mulino added that since this is a matter that is of interest 
to all, it must be handled as established in the Constitution.

  [Text] Panama City, 27 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Relations between 
Panama and the United States will not be affected by the 
incident yesterday in which a U.S. soldier was wounded by 
Panamanian police, who fired on the U.S. soldier's vehicle for 
allegedly driving with his lights off and not heeding a police 
order to stop, an official source said today. 
  National Police (PN) Director Oswaldo Fernandez declared 
that 
the incident in which U.S. Sergeant Maurice Neal was wounded in 
the shoulder by a Panamanian policeman does not have "any effect 
on U.S. relations." In this regard, Fernandez added U.S. 
Southern Command authorities and Panamanian PN exchanged reports 
on the case, adding it is "indeed true" Neal evaded and ran 
through a Panamanian police checkpoint. 
  Regarding whether the reaction of the police to fire on Neal 
is justified, Fernandez said that "it is too early to tell, 
because we must first verify the situation and hear the account 
of events from the PN Office of Professional Responsibility," 
which is investigating the case. 
  The Panama-based U.S. Southern Command maintains 
approximately 10,000 soldiers in installations along the length 
of the 80-km interoceanic Canal. U.S. troops must abandon these 
installations totally by 31 December 1999, as stipulated by the 
Canal Treaties signed by the two countries in 1977.

  [Text] Panama, 26 May (AFP) -- The U.S. proposal concerning 
uniform legislation to eliminate banking secrecy in Latin 
America "does not favor Panama's interests" because the country 
has enough laws to investigate money laundering activities, 
Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Mulino said today. 
  The United States issued the proposal during a meeting with 
representatives of the Andean Pact countries (Bolivia, Colombia, 
Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela), held on Tuesday and Wednesday in 
Bolivia to analyze the struggle against drug trafficking. 
  The U.S. Department of State representative, Paul Valky, 
said 
in Bolivia his country considers it essential to eliminate 
banking secrecy to fight against drug trafficking. 
  According to Mulino, "Panama is a sovereign country which 
can 
decide whether it accepts making its legislation uniform with 
that of the United States and other countries, but we have more 
than enough laws to fight drug trafficking activities without 
endangering banking confidentiality." 
  The powerful international banking center in Panama is 
considered by the U.S. authorities to be an important center for 
laundering money resulting from drug trafficking activities. 
  Mulino asserted: "It is not true that banks in Panama are 
impenetrable concerning legal issues or that banking 
confidentiality is an absolute regime." Banking confidentiality 
"is penetrable" upon request from the legal authorities, when 
legal processes are properly carried out, he added. Mulino said 
Panama has signed the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) to 
fight drug trafficking with the United States, Colombia, 
England, and the Central American countries. 
  Nevertheless, the U.S. Congress has yet to ratify the MLAT 
signed in 1992 with Panama, even though the Panamanian 
Legislative Assembly ratified the agreement, which allows 
authorities in different countries to exchange information about 
money laundering activities.

<F P=106> [Report by Esteban Huertas G.] </F>
  [Text] Galo Pinto, executive director of the Association of 
Colon Free Zone Users, said yesterday that the Colon Free Zone 
"will abide by the commercial sanctions ordered by the UN 
against Haiti." Pinto said that "this Free Zone respects the 
decisions made by the government" in regard to situations that 
affect the democratic development of any country, in this case 
Haiti. 
  Galo Pinto said that "users of the Free Zone are studying 
the 
effects the suspension of commercial exchange will have on that 
Caribbean nation." 
  Meanwhile, a reliable source who requested anonymity said 
that "Haitian businessmen are among the top clients of the Free 
Zone; they invest thousands of balboas to purchase products that 
are later reexported" to that French-speaking nation. 
  According to the spokesperson, "Haiti currently has one of 
the biggest markets in the Caribbean and ranks among the 10 
biggest Free Zone purchasers." 
  For the second time, the Colon Free Zone, third-largest free 
zone in the world after Hong Kong and Singapore, will respect 
the UN decision against Haiti. The UN sanctions on Haiti are 
aimed at restoring democracy in that country and ensure the 
return to the country of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
  The Association of Colon Free Zone Users is currently 
studying the dispositions being implemented by other Latin 
American governments against Haiti.

  [Text] Sucre, Bolivia, 26 May (EFE) -- Bolivian President 
Sanchez de Lozada announced today his intention of establishing 
a Constitutional Court to restructure the judiciary. 
  After meeting with Supreme Court members in Sucre, the 
country's administrative capital, Sanchez de Lozada announced 
that he will promote the establishment of a Constitutional Court 
during the extraordinary congressional sessions that started 
last week, and during which the constitution will be amended. 
  After meeting with Sanchez de Lozada, acting Chief Justice 
Gualberto Davalos expressed the Supreme Court's opposition to 
the establishment of a Constitutional Court. 
  Davalos explained that the Bolivian Supreme Court has and 
will always oppose the establishment of a Constitutional Court, 
because it believes it would undermine the Supreme Court's 
powers and the autonomy of the judiciary. 
  Sanchez de Lozada expressed his determination to propose the 
establishment of a Constitutional Court in the constitutional 
amendments, and cited several European and Latin American 
countries that have one. 
  The Bolivian Supreme Court has been virtually paralyzed 
since 
last year in view of impeachment proceedings undertaken against 
its president, Edgar Oblitas, who has been charged with 
extortion.

  [Text] The issue of the reduction of Armed Forces human and 
financial resources continues in the news. In a speech, 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has denied it. 
  [Begin Sanchez de Lozada recording] I want to tell you that 
there never were, and never will be any plans of the sort 
reported in an opposition newspaper article--which, 
unfortunately, acquired some notoriety--because this institution 
safeguards all Bolivians, our sovereignty, our democracy, and 
our development. 
  We undoubtedly need to adopt many measures to improve the 
institution. That is only natural. These measures seek to make 
the Armed Forces a stronger institution, allowing them to better 
fulfill their institutional duties and to better represent and 
defend our fatherland. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The situation in the Armed Forces has been tense 
in the last few days as a result of the personnel reduction in 
the Armed Forces. Defense Minister Raul Tovar said that the 
comments made by General Moises Schiriqui Bejarano, Armed Forces 
chief of staff, were distorted. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Mario Espinoza] This report does 
not seek to increase a disagreement between the Armed Forces and 
the constitutionally established civilian government. The idea 
is to reflect what is happening between the Armed Forces and the 
executive branch. Today President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada 
arrived 40 minutes late to a ceremony prepared by his escort 
batallion. Furthermore, the issue of the reduction of personnel 
and economic resources in the Armed Forces has created concern 
not only because of the reaction of the Armed Forces chief of 
staff, as reported by an editorial in LA RAZON, but also because 
of how it was done, as if it were an answer to an offense 
against the Armed Forces which in reality never existed. This is 
why the comments of the defense minister also created concern 
when he said that the declarations of General Moises Schiriqui 
Bejarano have been distorted. 
  [Tovar] His comments were distorted. 
  [Espinoza] Does this mean that there are no disagreements 
between the Armed Forces and the civilian power? 
  [Tovar] No, there are no disagreements, absolutely none. 
There is complete respect for democracy. 
  [Espinoza] As far as we know, General Schiriqui never 
questioned the government's policy, in this case democracy. What 
is indeed under discussion is the possibility of a reduction of 
personnel and economic resources in the Armed Forces within the 
framework of the economic crisis affecting the country for the 
last few years. [passage omitted] [end recording] 
  After President Sanchez de Lozada delivered his speech the 
impasse with the Armed Forces was overcome. President Sanchez de 
Lozada was very clear in the speech he made during the ceremony 
on the anniversary of the Colorados Regiment. 
  [Begin recording] [Espinoza] President Sanchez de Lozada, 
with the Constitution in his hands, reminded the Armed Forces of 
their constitutional role of guaranteeing the stability of the 
legally established government and of cooperating in the overall 
development of the country. 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] The Armed Forces have the basic role of 
defending and maintaining national independence [words 
indistinct], and the honor and national sovereignty, insuring 
the reign of the Constitution, guaranteeing the stability of the 
legally established government, and cooperating in the overall 
development of the country. This is the government policy, this 
is the government guideline [words indistinct]. 
  [Espinoza] President Sanchez de Lozada said there is not, 
nor 
will there be, any policy that does not benefit the nation and 
this includes the Armed Forces because when a country grows, its 
Armed Forces also grow. 
  [Sanchez de Lozada in progress] a stronger institution, 
better prepared to fulfill its constitutional duties, and to 
represent, and defend our country. [words indistinct] 
  [Espinoza] The president believes there are no poor 
countries 
with great Armed Forces and that the current effort is to 
strengthen the national economy and society, to educate the 
people, to watch over their health, and also to appropriate 
resources to have a strong Armed Forces. In the afternoon, the 
president summoned the high military command to explain the 
government policy regarding the Armed Forces. Then Armed Forces 
Commander General Fernando Sanjinez referred to the presidential 
speech. 
  [Sanjinez] We are very pleased with the speech delivered by 
the president this morning. We are really very pleased with his 
speech. 
  [Espinoza] Apparently the situation is now clearer. There 
was 
undoubtedly a moment of confrontation but following the meeting 
the situation is completely normal. [end recording]

  [Text] In referring to bank secrecy and the tapping of 
telephone conversations, President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada 
stated in Sucre: 
  Nobody is thinking about lifting bank secrecy. There is no 
plan to this end, and still less to (?violate) the specific 
rights of Bolivian people living in democracy. An authorization 
issued by a prosecutor or a judge is necessary to do this. 
  Speaking about the militarization of the Chapare zone, the 
president said: 
  There is no intention of militarizing the struggle against 
drug trafficking. I was never in favor of that when I was a 
member of the opposition, and still less so now that I am in 
government.

  [Text] Brazil and Russia have begun talks seeking to 
intensify bilateral trade relations. 
  During his meeting with President Itamar Franco at Planalto 
Palace today, Russian Congress President Vladimir Shumeyko 
defended the need to intensify cooperation and trade between the 
two countries, particularly with regard to the use of nuclear 
energy for peaceful purposes. 
  According to reports by the press adviser for the Russian 
delegation currently visiting Brazil, (Yuriy Alkanov), President 
Franco's meeting with Shumeyko is not a simple courtesy visit 
but the beginning of a new stage in the two countries' trade 
relations. He pointed out that Shumeyko was authorized by 
President Boris Yeltsin to discuss state matters with the 
Brazilian president.

<F P=106> [Report by Bette Veloso from the federal Congress in </F>
Brasilia] 
  [Text] Senator Joao Rocha [Liberal Front Party-Tocantins], 
chairman of the Senate Economic Affairs Committee, has announced 
that the committee will next week resume its debate on the draft 
patents law. 
  Rocha said he awaits only the final report of Senator Jose 
Richa [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Parana State], who is 
the rapporteur of the proposal, to open the debate. The draft 
patents law is designed to protect patents rights against acts 
of piracy. The United States has gone so far as to demand the 
approval of the law in order to continue to maintain trade 
relations with Brazil. 
  The Brazilian Government had promised to have the law 
approved by the middle of this month. Senator Rocha noted, 
however, that this deadline is unfeasible. He noted that the 
committee is not hurrying because it wants to pass a law that 
will be in the best interests of the country. 
  Rocha believes that the draft industrial property law will 
be 
voted on only during the extension of the congressional recess 
in July--if there is one--or during the second half of this year 
during the electoral campaign. 
  The rapporteur has already announced that the proposal will 
be amended in order to have its provisions conform with the 
decisions included in the GATT accord, and it will have to go 
back to the Chamber of Deputies after the Senate vote.

  [Text] Brasilia, 29 May (AE) -- Today during the opening 
session of the Second Southern Cone Marketing Congress, Industry 
and Commerce Minister Aecio Alvares reported that the government 
is studying a draft anti-dumping bill. He said that the 
government is worried about the problem as customs barriers are 
being eliminated over the entire world, and dumping and 
subsidies are becoming frequent practices in international 
trade. "In these cases we need to react immediately, or face the 
disappearance of some industries," he said. 
  Alvares mentioned the case of the textile industry, which 
faces competition from Korean products arriving in Brazil with 
prices 50 percent below domestic prices. "We cannot stop 
encouraging trade at lower prices," he said, but "we also cannot 
allow subsidies or dumping practices," he added. According to 
the minister, Mercosur [Common Market of the South] is 
particularly important in combating these two unfair trade 
practices that hurt the free market, as the regional trade bloc 
strengthens the position of Brazil in international forums such 
as GATT. 
  The minister also said that the participation of private 
initiative in the detection of harmful practices in trade is 
essential. Alvares said that Mercosur is already a real market. 
Businessmen from the four member countries--Brazil, Argentina, 
Uruguay, and Paraguay--are already identifying potential joint 
actions and solutions to common problems. He mentioned the 
initiative of the shoe industry businessmen of Novo Hamburgo, 
Rio Grande do Sul, who are contacting their Argentine and 
Uruguayan counterparts to defend themselves from the trade 
actions of Chinese shoe producers in the international market. 
  The Second Southern Cone Marketing Congress began today with 
an attendance of 2,500 -- 1,000 more than what was expected by 
the Parana Marketing and Sales Managers Association (ADVB), 
which is organizing the congress. The congress will last until 
31 May, and among its highlights will be presentations by Alvin 
Toffler, one of the greatest international marketing 
specialists, and by Serge Ogranovitch, a Frenchman resident in 
the United States who is a key player in projects for forming 
economic blocs. Ogranovitch has counseled Japan and its partners 
in the consolidation of the Asian trade bloc.

  [Text] The party leaders' deadline to decide about calling 
for new constitutional reforms is 31 May. This warning was made 
by Constituent Congress President Senator Humberto Lucena. 
  According to Lucena, even if the constitutional reform work 
continues for eight or 10 more days, the amendment that 
contemplates reviewing the Constitution every 10 years will have 
to be voted on in the first round of voting on 31 May: 
  [Begin Lucena recording] The deadline can be extended only 
enough to allow Constituent Congress members to complete the 
voting process in two rounds. [end recording] 
  Lucena also warned that he will only propose voting on the 
amendment if there is a consensus among party leaders. So far 
this consensus has not been ensured: The PT [Workers Party] and 
the PDT [Democratic Labor Party] do not support the amendment 
because it allows changes in the federal system and regarding 
independence among the three government branches.

<F P=106> [Report by Chico Otavio] </F>
  [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 26 May (AE) -- Brigade General Joao 
Consenza, 60, was elected president of the Military Club on 25 
May. He is willing to resort even to the courts to protest the 
loss of purchasing power in the salaries of Armed Forces 
members. Consenza, who was the candidate for Renewing Action 
[Acao Renovadora], defeated General Jose Oscar Bellas Galvao in 
receiving 66 percent of the overall votes. 
  Consenza's victory represented the choice of 4,500 officers 
who voted for a Military Club that can participate actively in 
political matters. The new president said that one of his 
program priorities is "to promote and stimulate civic and 
patriotic demonstrations as well as studies and debates on 
national matters of paramount importance." 
  The general promised to do his best to obtain better 
salaries for the Armed Forces. According to him, the salaries of 
the military are "horrible." In the program, Renewing Action 
commits itself to defending the interests of Military Club 
members and "to fighting for measures that ensure their rights, 
be it in the courts or outside of them." Consenza asserted, 
however, that he is not planning to clash with the military 
ministers. 
  One of the first steps the new president will take will be 
to 
study the details of the lawsuit filed by the current club 
administration to protest to the federal government the loss in 
salaries' purchasing power that has resulted from the economic 
plan. The general confessed: "I know none of the details of this 
lawsuit." The lawsuit was prepared by Jurist Saulo Ramos, who 
charged the club millions for his work. 
  Joao Consenza will be installed on 26 June to replace 
General 
Nilton Cerqueira, who leaves the presidency of the Club after 
four years to run for federal deputy. According to the new 
president, the Military Club will not officially support any 
military candidate. "Personally, however, I support these 
candidacies, and will vote for General Newton Cruz for Rio de 
Janeiro governor," he admitted.

  [Excerpts] Brasilia, 30 May (AE) -- The Provisional Measure 
in the Economic Stabilization Program that creates the URV [real 
value unit] has become Law No. 8880. The measure, which was 
approved by congress, was sanctioned by President Itamar Franco 
on 27 May with two vetoes and it was published in the official 
gazette on 28 May. [passage omitted] 
  The two vetoes by President Franco to Provisional Measure 
482 
affect the parity between agricultural products prices 
(Paragraph 2, Article 16) and labor relations (Article 41). 
Paragraph 2, Article 16, established that "monetary correction" 
of rural financial, marketing, or investment credit operations 
regardless of their source, "must be equivalent to the minimum 
prices in force for agricultural products." This amendment was 
part of the agreement reached between the congressional ruralist 
bloc and the government to approve the provisional measure.

  [Text] Military Police [PM] Major Ronaldo Silva of the 9th 
BPM [Military Police Battalion] (Rocha Miranda District), whose 
name had been included on the list of bribes paid by numbers 
game kingpin Castor de Andrade, was killed the morning of 24 
May. He was murdered by more than 15 machine-gun bullets in 
Colegio District, in the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. The PM 
major was in his car and was attacked when he stopped at a 
traffic light. 
  According to Lieutenant Colonel Paulo Cunha, commander of 
the 
9th BPM, the major had found a witness who could prove he was 
not guilty of the charges being pressed against him and also had 
discovered that his name had been unduly included on the list. 
  The courts on 24 May ordered that six of the eight numbers 
game kingpins serving their sentences in the Vieira Ferreira 
Neto Institute Penitentiary be transferred to another jail. The 
decision resulted from irregularities that had occurred at the 
institute, where the criminals continued to control the 
irregular game via the phone. The six criminals will be sent to 
three different penitentiaries.

  [Text] Santiago, 27 May (EFE) -- The police revealed today 
that the most important Chilean drug trafficker, Selim 
Valenzuela Galdames, who got away a few days ago while being 
taken from prison to a hospital for a medical checkup, bribed 
the prison guards who were guarding him to let him escape. 
  Prison guard Alex Valdebenito Carrasco, one of the four 
guards in charge of guarding Valenzuela while he was being taken 
to the hospital, confessed to having received the equivalent of 
$4,700 to let him go. 
  Prison Police Director Claudio Martinez disclosed during a 
news conference today that the four guards involved had been 
dismissed, and are now at the disposal of the courts in 
Valparaiso, the main Chilean port, where the drug trafficker 
escaped. 
  Selim Valenzuela is regarded as the mastermind behind a 
shipment to Sweden of 40 kg of cocaine, which was found by the 
Swedish police in the port of Goteborg. 
  The drugs had been packed in 1,750 boxes of raisins, but 
were 
detected by Goteborg customs authorities. 
  Two of the individuals involved in the case, the Chileans 
Jorge Chadwick Vergara and Rene Ramirez Barrientos, who reside 
in Sweden, were sentenced by the Swedish courts to 10 and nine 
years' imprisonment respectively. 
  Jose Miguel Vallejos, spokesman for the Chilean 
Investigative 
Police Antinarcotics Directorate, told the local media that 
Valenzuela's escape is "serious," and noted that "he is very 
valuable to the Investigative Police because he is considered 
one of the most important Chilean traffickers due to his 
international links."

  [Text] Quito, 28 May (EFE) -- The Maoist group "Inti Puka" 
("Red Sun" in Quechua) that is similar to the Peruvian terrorist 
Shining Path movement claimed responsibility on Saturday, 28 
May, for the attack on an energy tower that left the water 
processing plant that supplies half the city of Quito without 
electricity. 
  In anonymous telephone calls to local radio stations, 
persons 
who claimed to belong to the "Red Sun" said the attack is to 
protest the privatization plan implemented by the government of 
conservative Sixto Duran-Ballen. 
  The attack, with three dynamite charges, downed an energy 
tower in the outskirts of this city, leaving the Papallacta 
water processing plant without electricity. This plant provides 
water to almost half of Quito's 1.5 million inhabitants. 
  On several occasions civilian and military authorities have 
announced the dismantling of the "Red Sun," which has claimed 
responsibility for tens of bomb attacks in past years. Until now 
there have been no victims. 
  "We want to stress that we exist and that we will continue 
operating clandestinely against the government," one of the 
alleged terrorists who called the radio stations affirmed.

  [Text] Concerning a report published by the Argentine 
publication AMBITO FINANCIERO, in which among other things the 
chief executive notes that he would "do his utmost not to 
dissolve Congress," President Juan Carlos Wasmosy last night 
said: "I do not have any power to dissolve Congress." 
  The chief executive said that his words had been 
misinterpreted. He emphasized that he does not have the 
"constitutional power to dissolve Congress." He added that he 
fully disagrees with any aggression against Congress. Wasmosy 
pointed out: "This is far from my intention." 
  The president noted that when he said that "the people must 
mature" he meant the entire society (government officials, 
politicians, entrepreneurs, trade union leaders, journalists, 
and so on) and not specifically Congress. He added that the 
Paraguayan people are gradually changing their beliefs. 
  Moving on, the president recognized the activities currently 
being carried out by congressmen. He described as normal the 
controversial positions that exist between the executive and 
legislative branches, bearing in mind the democracy prevailing 
in our Republic. 
  President Wasmosy emphasized: "As we pursue the path of 
democracy, all of us are growing up." He claimed that it is 
normal to make mistakes. The president emphasized that he trusts 
these mistakes will be corrected in favor of most Paraguayan 
people. 
<H5>  Laino Does Not Believe in Dissolution of Congress </H5>
  President Wasmosy last night received the European Union's 
Silver ECU, delivered by Franco Teucci, the European Union's 
representative in our country, to mark the Day of Europe. During 
the award ceremony Dr. Domingo Laino, of the Authentic Radical 
Liberal Party, ruled out the possibility of a break in the 
democratic process. 
  Laino pointed out: "I am not really acquainted with the 
remarks, but I do not see why he should worry about Congress, 
because Congress is not seeking to destabilize; quite to the 
contrary, Congress is trying to stabilize democracy." 
  Laino emphasized: "A group within the Colorado Party has 
maximalist and fundamentalist attitudes. I believe the 
destabilizing trend involves this group. I believe the 
opposition, Congress, and other segments outside the ruling 
party are demonstrating a very mature and very thoughtful 
attitude."

  [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy has sent a letter to 
Congress President Evelio Fernandez Arevalos explaining the real 
meaning of his remarks to an Argentine newspaper with respect to 
the dissolution of Congress. 
  The president has just sent a note to Fernandez saying that 
the declarations appearing in newspapers saying that he would do 
his utmost not to dissolve Congress do not reflect what he 
honestly thinks. 
  Asked about the matter, Senator Evelio Fernandez Arevalo 
said 
he was satisfied with the president's explanation: 
  [Begin recording] The note has persuaded me. I think, as I 
said before, there has been a mistake in the way he expressed 
himself or in the transcription of his remarks. I could not 
imagine the president experiencing an internal struggle to 
prevent the dissolution of Congress. I said earlier that I could 
not conceive of anyone having a hidden agenda to provoke such a 
negative thing. 
  The note that the president had the deference to send me, I 
must admit, puts things in the right perspective. I think we 
must consider the episode closed. [end recording]

  [Text] Chamber of Deputies President Francisco Jose de 
Vargas noted that if it is true that President Juan Carlos 
Wasmosy made remarks [on the possible dissolution of Congress], 
it would demonstrate that he is unaware of the Constitution 
"because he cannot dissolve Congress, only through a coup 
d'etat." 
  The PLRA [Authentic Radical Liberal Party] congressman 
emphasized that Wasmosy does not have the slightest possibility 
of constitutionally dissolving Congress, and he therefore "must 
understand that he can dissolve it through a coup d'etat alone, 
thus violating the Constitution." 
  De Vargas warned the chief executive that if he carries out 
his threat, he must be aware of the fact that he will challenge 
the Paraguayan people. De Vargas noted: "As we challenged 
[former dictator General Alfredo] Stroessner with all our 
strength, with thousands of comrades killed and hundreds of 
thousands of comrades deported and tortured, he must be aware of 
the fact that we will challenge him with the same strength and 
determination with which we challenged Stroessner, if he decides 
to become a dictator through a coup d'etat." 
  De Vargas noted that the citizens have changed their 
attitude 
and that over the past five years citizens have become used to 
freedom, the right to assemble, and the right to demonstrate. De 
Vargas pointed out: "Therefore, the chief executive must assess 
all these facts very thoroughly before daring to make a 
decision, but if he wants to make a decision, he is free to make 
the decision he wants." 
  Among other things, the lower house president expressed his 
surprise over Wasmosy's remarks "because I consider him too 
intelligent and well-educated a man to make those remarks."

<F P=106> ["Transcription of the text" of an interview with President </F>
Juan Carlos Wasmosy by unidentified reporter; place and date not 
given; published in the 26 May edition of the Buenos Aires 
newspaper AMBITO FINANCIERO] 
  [Text] [AMBITO FINANCIERO] There is a lot of criticism 
against your administration in the newspapers. You seem to be 
concerned about what they say. 
  [Wasmosy] Today a social communicator has much more power 
than a minister. So much so that if a bad communicator says 
something silly, people tend to believe what he said, even when 
you prove it is nonsense and untrue. Today the so-called fourth 
power plays an essential role in the process to consolidate 
democracy. Of course, it is a process to form a conscience and 
mature. We must all learn, including those who own those key 
means of communications. 
  [AMBITO FINANCIERO] It is surprising to see how much the 
media has changed since Alfredo Stroessner's times. 
  [Wasmosy] Just think that in the past we used to read the 
newspaper from back to front. Influential journalists, in fact 
the only ones around, were those who specialized in soccer or 
other sports. Now everything has changed, although in some 
aspects everything is being exaggerated. Every front page is 
full of reports on scandals, corruption; nothing constructive. 
We have the impression that we live in chaos. But you have seen 
that is not the case. Nothing happens in the streets. There is 
no violence. People work in cities and rural areas. We have 
problems, of course, but not to the degree stressed by the press. 
  [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Do you think there are special reasons 
or 
interests behind that exaggeration? 
  [Wasmosy] In general terms, I can say that the campaign has 
intensified since the Sao Paulo Forum meeting (international 
leftist leaders meeting). Many people will be in trouble if 
democracy consolidates, as the country will grow and they will 
no longer be able to live as if the country were a ranch. The 
same thing will happen with other nations that think it 
convenient to keep us as suppliers of raw materials. 
  [AMBITO FINANCIERO] I see that you maintain a nationalist 
spirit, something traditional in Paraguay. 
  [Wasmosy] Look, this is personal, a very personal opinion. 
There are two strong institutions in this country turning 
nationalism into something very strong: the Church and the Army. 
This is why they are so often attacked. On one hand we have all 
these tents and protest movements that are separating the Church 
from its evangelical and pastoral mission, and pressuring it to 
enter the political arena in the name of a liberation theory. 
Many people are involved in this campaign. We must be careful 
because it does not affect only us. 
  But I do not want to speak about other countries, as a 
matter 
of respect. In other places these forces have also tried to 
divide the Army, but they failed despite all their efforts. The 
Armed Forces are being reorganized, without losing respect for 
the chain of command or discipline. We are giving it the human 
dimension required. The Armed Forces not only respect me, they 
even like me. 
  [AMBITO FINANCIERO] They will surely love you if you 
maintain 
or increase their budget. 
  [Wasmosy] Look, I will contradict you. The number of 
generals 
was reduced from 62 to 38, and Congress stripped them of even 
their food coupons and reduced everything they had. They have 
adapted. I must be honest and say this because no one else 
admits it in this country. We face other risks. Those crying out 
on behalf of the ecology are people coming from industrialized 
countries, people who have destroyed everything. They try to use 
our Indians--we have 17 ethnic groups in Paraguay--as a 
mechanism to divide us and destroy the country's unity. They do 
everything to us. They overwhelm us. They seem to forget that 
democracy cannot exist without bread, and that it is very 
expensive. 
  Just look at the issue of drugs. We are being pressured 
because it is said that our country is being used for the 
transit of drugs. I say: Send helicopters, radars, and even 
personnel to control the traffic, but if consumption is not 
curtailed production, will never drop. We must be honest and 
accept that the principle of supply and demand does not exist 
for certain items alone. 
  [AMBITO FINANCIERO] The economy is becoming global. Do you 
not think that violence might also become global? And I cite the 
case of Chiapas, in Mexico, as an example. 
  [Wasmosy] Chiapas, Santiago del Estero [Argentina], San 
Pedro 
in Paraguay, etc. Everything is part of a single plan. Proof of 
that is that part of the labor movement believes in violence and 
asks for things they know cannot be granted: a 40 percent salary 
increase, withdrawal from Mercosur [Common Market of the South], 
an urgent employment policy, etc. It is very easy to ask. I 
would like to ask an entrepreneur who tried to become president 
and who supported the strike [referring to National Encounter's 
Guillermo Caballero Vargas]: If he agrees with the strike's 
motives, why does he not grant a 40 percent salary increase to 
his own employees? Because you must be consistent and do what 
you say should be done. About the demand to withdraw from 
Mercosur, I say as president, because I have also been 
integration minister, that I will not integrate the country if 
integration will not benefit our country. But I am convinced 
there is no other path than integration, unless someone shows me 
something better. 
  That does not mean I will jump into an empty swimming pool 
and kill my country with me. There are different ways to 
integrate. How can you ask for a 40 percent increase if that 
means 40 percent inflation? In Mercosur we are calling for 
coordination of macroeconomic policies. Then, gentlemen, we must 
find a way to understand the problem facing Brazilians without 
ruining Argentine industrialists. I do not have the instruments 
to implement our government programs, but what can I do? We have 
an obsolete Penal Code and Code of Proceedings while banks raise 
interest rates. We cannot retool our industries with 36 percent 
or 42 percent interest rates. But what is the problem? 
  The problem is that I cannot tighten the screws because of 
the Central Bank Law and the Banks Law approved in 1952. We must 
update all those mechanisms. We have a new Constitution, and we 
must adapt those laws to the new Constitution and update them. 
We are developing an economy that is not directed or controlled 
by the state. Do you realize that? This is why I say that 
democracy is nice, expensive, and demands a lot of maturity. 
  [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Your reflections stress items that have 
affected many transition governments on their path from a 
dictatorial to a democratic system. 
  [Wasmosy] I would not blame the system that much. It is very 
difficult for an obedient society to become an intelligent 
society. Our people are used to being directed. They are used to 
asking the boss what he thinks, and then just following him. 
  We must force each individual to think on his own, to have 
his own opinion. But that will require time and maturity. Here 
is where I think we must be firm in staying on course and 
maintaining our objectives. 
  [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Is everything against you, then? 
  [Wasmosy] Obviously. Media sources have not trained their 
people. Who exactly are most journalists? 
  [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Perhaps you are confused about that. 
  [Wasmosy] Very well. It is possible. 
  [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Do you know what I notice? It seems that 
you cannot govern, as was the case with Fujimori at one time. 
  [Wasmosy] I tell you that I will do everything in my power 
to 
avoid dissolving Congress; I have confidence in people.... I am 
confident that they will mature. What happened to the Senate 
Investigative Commission on Illegal Activities? They put their 
foot in it so many times that they have lost all credibility. 
  As for unions, their strikes have failed. Who else will 
believe in them? They have to justify the money they receive 
from abroad. We.... No other president has done what I did: 
sponsor a round table, a Social Development Council where 
everyone is heard. But they withdrew. Why? The peasants came and 
raised their problems: They were given a solution, which was 
welcomed "with applause." And they are satisfied. 
  Transport workers called for a strike. We told them: 
Gentlemen, if you disagree, please bring another proposal to 
resolve the problem between transport enterprises and their 
employees. But they failed to show up at three consecutive 
sessions of the Council. Why? They wanted the strike. We 
arranged an agreement between employees and employers through 
the justice and labor ministry, but they once again reacted. 
Because what they wanted was to promote destabilization. 
  [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Going back to the subject of foreign 
models, you have already said that you would not like your 
government to look like "the Fujimori experience." 
  [Wasmosy] Yet it should be noted that I respect his 
experience, because what Fujimori did was to strengthen 
democracy. 
  [AMBITO FINANCIERO] If we consider other less traumatic 
models, if you consider the Argentine transition with Raul 
Alfonsin, and the Uruguayan transition with Julio Maria 
Sanguinetti, which one do you think was better? 
  [Wasmosy] Sanguinetti, Sanguinetti! 
  [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Can you explain your reasons? 
  [Wasmosy] I want to tell you that in the case of Dr. 
Alfonsin, for example, there was a reaction against the Army. I 
wonder, had the Army failed to do what it did--and I am not 
supporting abuses, because I am neither a terrorist nor a 
dictator, no, no. I tell you, I have always seen the press 
reporting, for example: The Army has committed such and such an 
abuse. 
  And the people who killed the police chief's daughters, who 
have blown up cars, who have killed people, are they all 
good-natured people? Somebody therefore had to come out the 
winner, and with civic courage the Argentine Army brought peace. 
Dr. Alfonsin then completed the other institutions. But if the 
military had not done what they did, Alfonsin would not have 
been able to do what he did, and Menem would not have been able 
to consolidate the economy as he did. They could do it because 
other people resolved the problems of the other areas of 
government. 
  [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Getting away from politics, the point is 
how to incorporate the informal economy into the transition 
system. 
  [Wasmosy] The informal sector will be legalized only when 
inflation in Paraguay and in neighboring countries reaches more 
or less the same level, or similar levels. And when taxes on 
domestic consumption are also put more or less at the same 
level. What happens with cigarettes? Brazil produces 
cigarettes, imposing a 386 percent tax on them. But if Brazil 
exports them, I believe the tax is 0 percent. What is the result 
of this? When they export cigarettes to Paraguay, they send only 
the documents. Just imagine, in Paraguay we have a tax of only 
26 percent. 
  Cigarette exporters therefore put the Brazilian product in 
Ciudad del Este, Capitan Bado, Pedro Juan Caballero, everywhere. 
The Brazilians who come to see the Iguazu waterfalls pay 500 
guaranies for cigarettes that cost 1,500 guaranies in Brazil. Do 
you know how many people enter Ciudad del Este per day? From 
Iguazu (Argentina) and Foz do Iguacu (Brazil), 200,000 people. 
If each one of them buys 10 packages.... I leave the 
calculations up to you.

  [Text] The president's decision to sign the law temporarily 
suspending the affiliation to political parties of active duty 
members of the military and policemen was made known at Congress 
at noon yesterday. The law thus enters into effect immediately. 
  In congressional circles, the executive branch's decision to 
promulgate the law a few days before it became effective 
automatically, according to the term stipulated by the 
Constitution, was interpreted as a positive gesture, and a sign 
of the president's willingness to respect congressional 
decisions. The executive branch had until 1 June to promulgate 
the bill. 
  The law that has just entered into effect has only two 
articles, and says: 
  "Article 1. The membership of active duty members of the 
military and policemen in political parties or movements is 
hereby temporarily suspended, and political parties or movements 
will erase their names from the party lists." 
  "Article 2. The active duty members of the military and 
policemen mentioned in Article 1 will recover, at their request, 
their full membership and seniority in the corresponding 
political party or movement once they retire." 
<H5>  Hurdles Still To Be Overcome </H5>
  Congress passed the bill temporarily suspending military 
members' and policemen's political membership in November of 
last year, but the executive branch vetoed the bill. 
  The veto was based on a technicality, as the executive 
branch 
said it had agreed on the need to adjust the military and police 
field of action to what is prescribed in the Constitution. The 
objection referred to the wording of the bill, which was 
allegedly imprecise. The executive also objected to the 
requirement forcing military members and policemen to request 
their reenlistment once they retired, as it believed the 
reenlisting should be automatic. Congress dismissed these 
arguments and overrode the veto. The law could still face a 
hurdle before implementation, as those who feel affected might 
file a petition asking that the law be declared unconstitutional.

  [Text] Asked if the executive branch has issued 
instructions to military commanders on the issue of the 
temporary suspension of their membership in political parties, 
Colonel Carlos Medina Monjagata, director of the Military 
Forces' Social Communications Center, said that the military are 
expecting a decision by Commander in Chief Juan Carlos Wasmosy 
on the matter. 
  Medina said there will be no institutional reaction on the 
issue until the executive branch promulgates the bill and the 
commander in chief decides what to do about it. 
  Medina reiterated, however, that the Armed Forces will obey 
this and all other legal dispositions on the matter. 
  The colonel said that the Constitution forbids the military 
from participating in partisan politics, and therefore 
absolutely nothing will occur if the law is approved. 
<H5>  Troop Mobilization </H5>
  Col. Medina announced that the 1st Infantry Division will 
mobilize to travel to Potrero del Carmen, Itacurubi de la 
Cordillera, at 0700 on 30 May. Medina said the unit will conduct 
a tactical demonstration for Army Officers Advanced Training 
School (EPOE) students. 
  The exercise is in cooperation with Army officers' training. 
  Brigade General Carlos Alberto Ayala is the current 
commander 
of the 1st Infantry Division. 
<H5>  Changes in Air Force </H5>
  On 26 May PAM [Air Force Pilot] Colonel Alejandro Roman was 
appointed commander of the Air Force Logistics Brigade. Roman is 
an experienced pilot. Last year he took advanced training 
courses in Taiwan at the invitation of that country's Armed 
Forces. 
  On 23 May Brigade General Hector Ocampos Diaz took over as 
Air Force chief of staff, replacing General Cesar Cramer, who 
was appointed defense vice minister. 
  On the occasion Colonel Livio Espinoza took over as 
commander 
of the 1st Air Brigade, replacing Ocampos Diaz.

  [Text] According to a joint declaration signed by Foreign 
Ministers Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner and Sergio Abreu Bonilla 
yesterday afternoon, Paraguay and Uruguay have begun to 
negotiate an agreement, which should be signed as soon as 
possible, establishing the two countries' reciprocal assistance 
in recovering stolen cars. The signing of this document will 
contribute to repressing this illegal activity, and will help 
speed up the process of returning stolen cars. 
  The joint declaration was signed at the Foreign Ministry. It 
was the Uruguayan foreign minister's last official activity in 
Paraguay. Abreu is scheduled to return to his country this 
morning after a three-day official stay in our country. 
  In the joint declaration the foreign ministers also 
recognized the increase in the consumption rate and illegal 
trade in narcotics, which constitutes a grave threat to our 
peoples' health and well-being and obligates all nations to 
share in the responsibility of repressing it. 
  The ministers ratified the importance for the two 
countries--in the context of the Parana-Paraguay waterway--of 
the work to eliminate existing obstacles to the effective use of 
port facilities granted to Paraguay in Montevideo and Nueva 
Palmira. Port authorities and operators from the two countries 
will meet in Montevideo during the second half of July. 
  The Uruguayan foreign minister returns to his country on a 
private plane at 0900 this morning.

  [Text] Based on the contention that the time that has 
elapsed since the implementation of the Constitution has not 
been sufficient to warrant its amendment, the Constitutional 
Committee of the Peruvian Constituent Congress tonight decided 
to turn down a petition to amend the Constitution, including a 
proposal that would cause President Alberto Fujimori to step 
down six months before the election date in order for him to be 
eligible to seek his reelection. The decision provoked protest 
within the opposition. 
  In justifying the decision, Congressman Carlos Ferrero Costa 
said that only five months have elapsed since the implementation 
of the Constitution. 
  [Begin Ferrero recording] In the first place, the president 
may step down whether a constitutional reform is approved or 
not. No constitutional reform is needed for the president to 
step down. Secondly, nowhere in the world is the incumbent 
president required to step down in order to seek his reelection.

  [Text] In a statement on the letter of intent the Peruvian 
Government is to sign with the IMF, the National Confederation 
of Businessmen [Conaco] charged that the government has become 
dependent on the IMF. 
  Conaco contends that in light of its dependence, the 
government has pushed its commitment to pay the foreign debt to 
the limit, thus postponing every serious attempt at reactivating 
the economy to improve the people's standard of living through a 
massive program and fair salaries, as well as an equitable 
distribution of wealth. 
  Conaco hopes that there may still be time "to replace these 
evil intentions" with good ones that would meet the Peruvian 
people's just aspirations for a better future. 
  The statement notes that Conaco has unsuccessfully 
recommended that the government introduce a number of corrective 
measures into its economic stabilization program. 
  Conaco adds that the letter of intent reveals that the 
Minimum Income Tax will be maintained, that no new tax 
stabilization contracts will be signed, that no new free trade 
zones will be created, that the prices of fuels and public 
utilities will be increased, that Sunat [National Tax 
Administration Superintendency] will tighten its control of 
taxpayers, and so forth. 
  The statement adds that the government is using only $250 
million of its privatization proceeds in social investments, and 
that part of these resources are instead being used to pay the 
foreign debt. 
  Similarly, Conaco adds, the government will consolidate all 
of its custom tariffs at 15 percent in 1995, and will further 
increase its foreign debt by financing programs to restructure 
the current debt. 
  Conaco states that the government insists on maintaining a 
rigid concept in its economic stabilization program, which is 
precisely the pivotal cause of the current recessive economic 
process "that brings about extreme poverty and unemployment." 
  The statement notes that Conaco has requested the 
elimination 
of the Minimum Income Tax because this is an across the board 
tax that affects 2 percent of company assets. 
  Conaco has also unsuccessfully demanded the reduction of the 
General Sales Tax and the Selective Consumers Tax as major steps 
toward reversing the shrinking of the market and boosting 
domestic production.

  [Excerpts] Lima, 27 May (EFE) -- The video showing Shining 
Path [SL] leader Abimael Guzman, which police seized in 1991, 
still is delivering mortal blows to the movement: It has helped 
capture the current Shining Path "No. 2" leader, Felipe Tenorio. 
  In February 1991, police found a videocassette in a Lima 
house supposedly used as Guzman's hideout. In the video, Guzman 
could be seen imitating the dance shown in the film "Zorba, the 
Greek." 
  The video also showed the main Shining Path leaders close to 
Guzman. Among them was Felipe Tenorio Barbaran, aka "Augusto," 
who also was dancing with his chief, "President Gonzalo" as he 
is addressed by his followers. 
  On 26 May, Peruvian police publicly presented Tenorio to the 
country dressed in the striped uniform worn by arrested 
terrorists. Tenorio probably will be sentenced to life 
imprisonment. 
  According to police, "Augusto" was the "No. 2" man in the 
new 
Central Committee of the Peruvian Communist Party, which is the 
real name of the Maoist terrorist group. "Augusto" is second 
only to Oscar Ramirez Durand, aka "Feliciano," who is the 
current Shining Path leader. 
  "Feliciano" has been trying to reorganize the terrorist 
group 
since Abimael Guzman's arrest in Lima on 12 September 1992. 
Guzman was later sentenced to life imprisonment. 
  "Feliciano" has bluntly rejected Guzman's proposal to the 
Peruvian Government calling for a peace accord as well as his 
orders to suspend attacks and murders. [passage omitted] 
  As in Guzman's case, "Augusto" was arrested at a house in 
Los 
Olivos District, Lima, without having the chance to shoot a 
single shot. He had been one of terrorists most wanted by the 
National Counterterrorism Directorate (Dincote). [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Caracas, 27 May (EFE) -- Enzo del Bufalo, minister 
of the Central Office of Coordination and Planning, today 
resigned in what appears to the beginning of a crisis in Rafael 
Caldera's government. 
  Del Bufalo has become the first minister of Caldera's 
government to resign from his post in the 114 days of the 
current administration. Nevertheless, it has been pointed out 
that in the coming hours other officials will leave the cabinet 
team. 
  Christian Democrat Caldera is preparing to make important 
changes in his government team, which in the eyes of his 
political adversaries, has offered an image of contradictions 
with regard to his policies, particularly in the economic field. 
The changes, it appears, are an attempt to revitalize his 
government, which appears trapped between the severity of the 
crisis and social demands. 
  Today, the Venezuelan press points out that all the 
ministers 
will place their posts at the president's disposal, thus making 
it easier for Caldera, who assumed power on 2 February, to make 
the changes he may deem necessary. 
  The opposition has accused Caldera of offering a 
contradictory image with regard to the policies that he insists 
on applying, and his ministers have found themselves in 
seriously contradictory positions. Nevertheless, it is a 
tradition of the old-time politician, who already governed 
Venezuela between 1969-74, to make his decisions under total 
secrecy until he decides to inform the nation, such as when he 
designated his cabinet a few hours before assuming the 
presidency. 
  The departure of Transport and Communication Minister Cesar 
Quintini has been reported by the Venezuelan media as a fact, 
although he has denied his resignation. Quintini is accused of 
maintaining a tolerant attitude with regard to corruption in his 
ministry. 
  Rafael Irribarren, deputy minister of transport and 
communication, resigned one month ago from his post after 
accusing Quintini of obstructing his efforts to dismantle the 
complex network of corruption that functions in that ministry. 
Irribarren charged that in his ministry, licenses, permits, and 
other official documents are sold and that commission fees are 
charged for granting concessions. 
  Local political sources claim that Quintini's continued 
presence in his post has created serious doubts about Caldera's 
will to struggle against corruption, one of the electoral 
banners that took him to the presidency. Other ministers are 
unhappy because they believe they have not received the support 
they need for a successful start to their duties. 
  In almost four months of government, Caldera has had to face 
a grave economic crisis, with a fiscal deficit of more than $4.5 
billion. The devaluation of the bolivar has become a pressing 
problem for Caldera. The dollar, which at the beginning of the 
month had been valued at 127.15 bolivares, this past Wednesday 
was valued at 175. 
  It appears that Development Minister Luis Carlos Palacios 
and 
Agriculture Minister Ciro Fonseca Anez could also leave the 
government.

  [Text] Caracas, 28 May (AFP) -- Today in Caracas, political 
analysts highlighted the news that President Rafael Caldera's 
administration, which will be four months in power on 2 June, 
faces its first crisis due to ministerial disagreement over the 
course of economic policies. 
  Government sources confirmed today the resignations of 
Planning (Cordiplan) Minister Enzo del Bufalo and Transport and 
Communications Minister Cesar Quintini, and said Caldera is 
expected to announce his new cabinet by Monday [30 May] at the 
latest. 
  According to political observers, Del Bufalo's departure is 
due to his "conceptual differences" with government economic 
proposals. Quintini was accused of "not touching the Perez 
corruption structures (referring to jailed former president 
Carlos Andres Perez) that rule the ministry," by his former 
deputy minister Rafael Iribarren, who resigned. Others who will 
leave their posts are the ministers for urban development and 
environment and natural renewable resources. 
  Central Information Office Chief Guillermo Alvarez Bajares 
justified the change of ministers arguing that this is not a 
single party administration and its heterogeneity makes 
differences understandable. Alvarez denied that the removal of 
ministers proves the failure of certain policies and he pointed 
out that the president has the power to modify and restructure 
his council of ministers at any moment. 
  The current cabinet, made up of 26 ministers, the federal 
district government, and the head of the Presidential Committee 
to Reform the State, had been restructured by Caldera on 31 
January, two days before becoming president.

  [Text] Caracas, 28 May (EFE) -- Today, the Venezuelan 
Government announced a series of changes in President Rafael 
Caldera's cabinet. These changes are designed to improve 
coherence in the government team. According to Guillermo 
Alvarez, chief of the Central Information Office, the new 
development minister will be Alberto Poletto, president of the 
Foreign Trade Institute [ICE]. Poletto will continue to be 
president of the ICE, and in the future, this office will become 
the ministry of industry and commerce. 
  Luis Carlos Palacios, the current development minister, will 
head the Central Office of Coordination and Planning. Palacios 
will replace Enzo del Bufalo who, according to the press, 
resigned because of serious differences with the other members 
of the economic cabinet. 
  Ciro Zaa, currently minister of urban development, has been 
appointed transport and communications minister. Zaa replaces 
Cesar Quintini who was accused of not being willing to attack 
the corruption spotted in the department by former Deputy 
Transport and Communications Minister Rafael Iribarren. 
  Francisco Gonzalez, currently president of the Urban 
Development Fund, will replace Ciro Zaa as the new minister of 
urban development. The Urban Development Fund will shortly come 
under the Urban Development Ministry. 
  One of the changes that surprised all the local political 
observers took place in the Venezuelan Investment Fund, 
responsible for the privatization process. Abdon Vivas Teran, 
head of the Venezuelan Investment Fund, has been replaced by 
Carlos Bernardez, a former president of the Bank of Venezuela, 
the oldest private bank in Venezuela. 
  The chief of the Central Information Office also announced 
that Alfredo Gruber will be the new president of the Venezuelan 
Guayana Corporation, the most powerful state-run business group. 
Gruber will replace Francisco Layrisse who, a few days ago, 
announced that he wishes to return to private practice. 
  The latest addition to the cabinet, announced today, has 
been 
the appointment of Pompeyo Marquez, currently a minister without 
portfolio, as coordinator for the government's social programs. 
The new members of the cabinet will be sworn in on Monday [30 
May] and will start to work immediately, Alvarez said.

appointed to the post. Observers believe President Caldera's 
decision to remove FIV President Abdon Vivas Teran was prompted 
by the way he handled Aeropostal's privatization, which was 
considered a failure because the bid was declared invalid. 
  It is also said the decision was prompted by the rejection 
of 
Air Force Commander General Otto Garcia Rivara, who reportedly 
objected to the fact that one of the enterprises participating 
in the bid was a Colombian airline. He believes Aeropostal is a 
strategic Venezuelan company, and one must take into account the 
border problems we have with our neighbor. 
  OCI [Central Information Office] chief Guillermo Alvarez 
explained that Abdon Vivas Teran will remain in the government 
even though he has left the FIV. This means he will possibly be 
appointed to another post in the ministerial cabinet. 
  [Begin recording] [Alvarez] I cannot report new changes. 
These are the ones the president authorized us to announce today. 
  [Briceno] Does this mean Mr. Abdon Vivas Teran is now out of 
the government? 
  [Alvarez] He is obviously out of the post he held. This does 
not mean he is out of the government. [end recording] 
  Alvarez announced Alberto Poletto will still be in charge of 
the Foreign Trade Institute [ICE]. This situation might 
propitiate a merger of the ICE and the Development Ministry, 
which would become the industry and commerce ministry. 
  Ciro Zaa Alvarez has been appointed to the MTC [Ministry of 
Transportation and Communications]. Zaa was formerly in charge 
of the Urban Development Ministry and Francisco Gonzalez, 
current president of the Urban Development Fund, was temporarily 
appointed to the post. President Caldera's plans include the 
unification of these infrastructure ministries. 
  Luis Carlos Palacios has been appointed to the Central 
Office 
of Coordination and Planning, replacing Enzo del Bufalo, who 
tendered his official resignation to the head of state. Another 
appointment made by President Caldera was that of Alfredo 
Gruber, current president of Palmaven in the Venezuelan 
Petroleum Corporation who will be in charge of the Venezuelan 
Corporation of Guayana. 
  To conclude, Pompeyo Marquez has been given responsibility 
for coordinating the government's social programs. The new 
ministers will be sworn in by President Caldera on Monday [30 
May] at Miraflores Palace.

  [Text] Caracas, 30 May (EFE) -- Today, Venezuelan President 
Rafael Caldera carried out his first cabinet change, only 117 
days after the start of his government and in the mist of a 
profound economic crisis. 
  Caldera, who assumed the presidency on 2 February, appointed 
Alberto Poletto, Luis Carlos Palacios, Ciro Zaa, and Carlos 
Bernandez as ministers of Development, Central Office of 
Coordination and Planning [Cordiplan], Transport and 
Communication, and Venezuelan Investment Fund, respectively. 
  Caldera's restructuring of his cabinet has been interpreted 
by local political experts as a sign that the president is 
prepared to make a switch to an economic policy less populist 
than the one he proposed during the elections campaign and 
closer to the neoliberal policy implemented by former president 
Carlos Andres Perez. 
  Apparently, Caldera, who was one of the most severe critics 
of the free market policy promoted by Perez, has been unable to 
structure an economic formula out of the neoliberal guidelines. 
  Venezuela is living through a difficult economic situation, 
with a fiscal deficit estimated at more than $4.5 billion, a 
severe depreciation of the bolivar, and an explosive social 
situation fueled by a significant fall in the purchasing power 
of the people. 
  President Caldera put Carlos Bernandez at the head of the 
organization in charge of privatizing state enterprises. 
Bernandez has always been linked to the local banking sector and 
he has been president of the Bank of Venezuela, which is one of 
the most important banks in the country. Bernandez has offered 
to increase the privatization process. The local media has 
described his appointment as a victory for the financial sector, 
which was able to produce the departure of Abdon Vivas Teran, a 
politician very close to Caldera and to his electoral offer for 
an economy with a human face, from the Venezuela Investment Fund. 
  Luis Carlos Palacios, the new Cordiplan minister, replaces 
Enzo del Bufalo, a dissonant voice in Caldera's economic team. 
The new minister is closer to the free economy concepts that the 
Caldera administration apparently wants to adopt in this new 
phase. 
  Also, Alberto Poletto, president of the Foreign Trade 
Institute, will be development minister, which joins these 
departments to create the Industry and Commerce Ministry. 
  Ciro Zaa has been virtually forced to leave the Urban 
Development Ministry to take over the Transport and 
Communication Ministry vacated by Cesar Quintini, who was 
accused of maintaining an attitude of tolerance in multiple 
cases of corruption in his ministry. 
  Zaa will be replaced by Francisco Gonzalez, former president 
of the Urban Development fund. The responsibilities of Special 
Affairs Minister Pompeyo Marquez have been expanded and from now 
on he will also be responsible for the government's social 
programs.

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Bricente from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] OCI [Central Information Office] Chief Guillermo 
Alvarez Bajares says the national government's immediate 
priority is to send a bill to modify the Central Administration 
Law to the legislature so that several ministries can be merged. 
  The executive branch wants to merge several ministries, 
among 
them the Development Ministry and the Foreign Trade Institute 
which would become the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. 
Meanwhile, the Urban Development Ministry would be merged with 
the National Urban Development Fund to form the Infrastructure 
Ministry. 
  Alvarez Bajares explained that the Central Admiministration 
Law establishes how ministries are divided, and will require 
that a reform bill be sent immediately to parliament. 
  [Begin Alvarez Bajares recording] The deadline is as soon as 
possible. This does not mean we will be working on this on 
Monday or Tuesday, but we will do so as soon as possible. 
President Caldera discussed this several times during his 
electoral campaign and he is now implementing these corrective 
measures. [end recording] 
  Alvarez Bajares said that regardless of who wins the 
presidential elections in Colombia, Venezuela will pursue 
relations with the neighboring country in the truly positive 
manner in which they have been pursued so far, but in accordance 
with the integration process established by both governments.

<F P=106> [Report by Maria Lilibeth Dacorte in the Caraballeda Parish; </F>
from the "Union Radio News" newscast; broadcast in progress] 
  [Text] ...after the meeting, the secretary general of the 
Democratic Action Party, Luis Alfaro Ucero, officially announced 
that Carlos Andres Perez, twice nominated and elected president 
of the Republic, had been expelled from the party. 
  [Begin recording] [Alfaro Ucero] After meeting at length 
with 
many party members, [words indistinct] more than 80 percent of 
those attending the meeting voted to support the decision 
adopted by the National Executive Committee [CEN]. You know what 
the CEN had decided. The other.... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] [Words indistinct] he has been 
definitely expelled from the party? 
  [Alfaro Ucero] Yes. I ratified the decision made by the CEN 
regarding Carlos Andres Perez. The other decision made by the 
CEN -- this decision was read at this meeting and it was signed 
by all the secretaries general [words indistinct] -- was to give 
ample and solid support to the secretary general and 
organization secretary. 
  [Reporter] Claudio Fermin and [words indistinct] charged 
that 
no one voted on this decision. Please explain this to us. 
  [Alfaro Ucero] That depends on how you view this. It depends 
on how one wishes to present to the public the way the meeting 
was conducted. [end recording] 
  AD Secretary General Alfaro Ucero denied there is division 
within the party, and he said the party is being strengthened. 
He said decisions such as this one are normal within the party. 
According to Alfaro Ucero, time will decide which path the party 
should take. 
  As expected, Alfaro supporters and Perez supporters gauged 
their strength within the CEN, and, judging from the outcome, it 
is obvious that the Alfaro supporters had a majority of votes. 
According to Claudio Fermin, the rank and file do not support 
this decision.

<F P=106> [By Elias Garcia] </F>
  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 29 May (EFE) -- Colombians will 
have to go to runoff presidential elections on 19 June, since 
none of the 18 candidates secured a simple majority today's 
primary elections. 
  Contrary to poll estimates, both candidates finished in a 
virtual tie: liberal candidate Ernesto Samper, the favorite, 
garnered 45.2 percent of the votes, while conservative candidate 
Andres Pastrana obtained 44.9 percent. Former guerrilla Antonio 
Navarro Wolff of the "Commitment for Colombia" was third with 
3.8 percent of the votes, followed by Regina Betancourt of the 
Metapolitical Unitary Movement obtained 1.1 percent. 
  Blank votes accounted for 1.1 percent of the votes cast. 
Once again, abstentionism was one of the predominant notes of 
the day: less than 6 million people of a total of 17.1 million 
potential voters went to the polls, representing approximately 
70 percent abstentionism. 
  The narrow margin between the two principal contenders was a 
surprise because the majority of the polls put Samper 5 percent 
over Pastrana. 
  The elections took place amid calm, as occurred throughout 
the campaign in which there were no major incidents of violence. 
Colombians still recall with horror the previous presidential 
campaign in which three candidates were assassinated. 
  Beginning tomorrow, the candidates will no doubt begin the 
second stage of their election campaign. Their aim will be to 
garner the small percentage of votes (approximately 7 percent) 
that went to the other candidates today. The two candidates who 
will go to the runoff elections will seek to obtain the support 
of some of the 15 candidates who were eliminated by verdict of 
the polls, above all, Antonio Navarro, Regina Betancourt, Miguel 
Maza, and Enrique Parejo, who altogether obtained almost 6.5 
percent of the votes, some 400,000. 
  Of course it remains to be seen whether the votes of these 
candidates are "transferable" or, if on the contrary, their 
supporters do not respond to any persuasion. 
  It will be especially important to see what stand Antonio 
Navarro adopts. Some of his supporters in the Democratic 
Alliance (former M-19 guerrilla group) abandoned him in the 
middle of the campaign because they did not agree on going to 
the elections under another acronym and went over to Ernesto 
Samper's ranks. 
  More people are not expected to turn out for the runoff 
elections. Perhaps there will be less because the voters are 
tired (today's election was the second one this year and there 
is still another one following the runoff) and because of the 
negative influence of the World Cup in which Colombia will play 
against Romania on the eve of the runoff elections.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 29 May (EFE) -- Candidates 
Ernesto Samper and Andres Pastrana proclaimed victory today in 
Colombia's initial presidential elections and both expressed 
their confidence that they will win in the runoff elections on 
19 June. 
  The candidates made brief statements after 95.6 percent of 
the votes were counted and the results announced, giving them a 
wide margin over the remaining 16 candidates. 
  Liberal candidate Samper regretted that he did not win in 
the 
initial elections and thanked the residents of Santa Fe de 
Bogota who gave him a relatively broad margin compared with the 
rest of the country. 
  The liberals expected to garner more votes and the climate, 
although festive, was one of concern at the Orquidea Real Hotel 
where Samper kept abreast of the vote count. 
  The Pastrana supporters, on the other hand, were euphoric in 
the Tequendama Hotel because the slight margin garnered by 
Samper augurs well for them in the runoff elections. 
  Pastrana thanked his family, his supporters, and all of 
those 
who voted for any candidate and invited them to join his 
bandwagon. 
  Candidate Antonio Navarro of the Commitment with Colombia 
movement, who obtained a little over 3.5 percent of the votes, 
said he "was calm because despite all the difficulties that 
existed during the campaign, we obtained a decent and dignified 
vote which leaves us in a position to do well in the future."

<F P=106> [Interview with Luis Camilo Osorio, Colombian national civil </F>
registrar, by Chelo Garcia from the National Civil Registrar's 
Office in Bogota -- live] 
  [Text] [Garcia] Of the total of the countries votes, 95.6 
percent have been tallied. Ernesto Samper Pizano received 
2,551,029 votes, which represent 45.1 percent; Andres Pastrana 
Arango, 2,538,580 votes, which represent 44.9 percent; Antonio 
Navarro received 215,186 votes; Regina Betancourt, 64,610; 
Miguel Alfredo Maza Marquez, 54,731; and Alberto Mendoza 
Morales, 30,393. Mr. Registrar, now that the eighth bulletin has 
been released, everything indicates that a runoff election will 
have to be held on 19 June to elect the new President of the 
Republic. Is all set at the National Registrar's Office to meet 
this new challenge? 
  [Osorio] Yes. We had said that, because of the short time, 
we should suspend preparations for the runoff elections in case 
it proved unnecessary. But we will continue to work along the 
same lines, making preparations for the runoff election. 
  [Garcia] Is this the first time this has happened in 
Colombia? 
  [Osorio] Well, it is the first time there is an election by 
qualified vote. Consequently, a runoff election will be held.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Luis Camilo Osorio, registrar </F>
general of the National Civil Registry Office, by station 
announcer Dario Arizmendi in Santa Fe de Bogota -- live] 
  [Text] [Arizmendi] Good Morning, Mr. Luis Camilo Osorio. 
  [Osorio] Good morning, Dario. 
  [Arizmendi] Congratulations once again. The media, the 
observers, and the campaign headquarters have all highlighted 
your excellent work and that of your whole team at the National 
Registry, particularly, your diligence in releasing the 
information. 
  [Osorio] Why, thank you, Dario. We are very pleased, and I 
reaffirm that this was a team effort in which my coworkers 
accompanied me all the way. 
  [Arizmendi] Regarding the claims of alleged technical fraud 
made by Deputy Fabio Valencia Cosio, member of the Conservative 
Party National Directorate, just 72 hours ago? 
  [Osorio] There is absolutely no discussion of it. 
  [Arizmendi] Sir, will you issue Bulletin No. 11 before 1000 
[1500 GMT]? 
  [Osorio] We can try, Dario, but I do not think we will be 
able to release it any earlier. I expect to get there as early 
as possible to see what we can do before the tallying process 
begins. I do think, however, that there has been a significant 
amount of information. 
  [Arizmendi] How will the runoff election ballot work? When 
will the position drawing take place? What will the numbering 
system be? 
  [Osorio] I do not think there will be a need for a drawing 
or a special numbering system or anything like that. I think 
all that would hamper the campaigns. In any case, that is a 
decision we have to make in conjunction with the Electoral 
Council. Perhaps not to hold a drawing, but surely to approve a 
design for the ballot itself. There is not enough time to 
change all the advertising materials, nor would there be 
numbered positions on the ballot. One candidate would go on the 
left and the other on the right. 
  [Arizmendi] Would they carry the same 005 and 010 they did 
on the first ballot? 
  [Osorio] I imagine so, yes, because there is no other way to 
go about that. The funny thing is, however, that for the 
presidential election, that issue must be discussed with the 
Electoral Council, while the registrar approves all the other 
ballots on his own. 
  [Arizmendi] Based on the celebrity of yesterday's process, 
during which there was a very efficient flow of information 
throughout, we think you could have almost 90 or 95 percent of 
the results in by 1800 [2300 GMT] or 1900 [0000 GMT]. Is that 
so? 
  [Osorio] Dario, it is not so much the smaller number of 
candidates. I have said all along that the same number of 
voters who voted this time will again vote for one of the two 
candidates. Whoever is adding, moving documents, and so on, will 
take the same amount of time because the number of votes will 
still be the same, if not higher. 
  [Arizmendi] But there are less candidates, so the process 
should be simpler, should it not? 
  [Osorio] There are less candidates, but there is the same 
number of ballots. If 250 people voted at a given table, they 
are expected to do so again. Although they will only find two 
candidates on the ballot this time, they will vote in the same 
way they did the last time. Not much time can be saved here. 
Timing also depends on how fast local officials can get the 
tally sheets to a transmission center. Basically, the timing 
will be the same. 
  [Arizmendi] Will the electoral officials be the same ones 
who acted this time? 
  [Osorio] Yes. We have already summoned the members of the 
electoral boards, the table officials, and the logistics team, 
which includes transportation, communications, and supplies. 
Everything has been foreseen and practiced already. 
  [Arizmendi] There is no impediment for the election to be 
held in three weeks time, from an organizational, technical, and 
budget stand point? 
  [Osorio] No. Nothing at all. Everything has been planned, 
calculated, and foreseen. We had already decided this a while 
ago, because 21 days does not give much time for anything. 
  [Arizmendi] Mr. Registrar, will there be any change in the 
voter registration process? Will any voting cards be issued in 
the next few days? 
  [Osorio] Unfortunately not. We will issue voter cards to 
those who have that right, such as former rebels who have 
reentered civilian life, and we will continue to do so. Those 
who are not eligible, because they failed to register at least 
four months prior to the first election, will not receive their 
cards yet. If there are voter cards that were eligible and have 
not yet been delivered, we will go ahead and deliver them. 
  [Arizmendi] According to statistics and information from the 
Civil Registry, was this the closest election ever in Colombian 
history? 
  [Osorio] Without a doubt. Of course. The difference 
between the two front runners has no precedent. 
  [Arizmendi] Would you say there could be a lower abstention 
level this time around? 
  [Osorio] That is something we all hope for, Dario. 
Democracy can only be consolidated with a lot of votes and a 
lot of people.

<F P=106> [Statement by Andres Pastrana, Conservative Party </F>
presidential candidate, at the Tequendama Hotel in Santa Fe de 
Bogota on 29 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] The change started today. [applause] We will 
complete this work in the next three weeks. The same policy was 
applied today. The people won. In the next three weeks, 
Colombia will return to the hands of all Colombians. [applause] 
The Colombian people have spoken with a strong, convincing 
voice. Today, you voted for a change. No more of the old 
promises and the old politics. You have voted for a new 
leadership above the old political machinery. Millions of 
Colombians have voted for the future, not for the past. 
  Throughout the country, this wonderful nation, there is a 
strong desire for change. We have seen our fellow countrymen on 
the streets. We have heard this in your voices, which have 
demanded a change, on the street and in your homes. We have 
felt it in the thousands of hands we have shaken, the many 
Colombians who have supported us with their hearts. Colombia's 
time is up. The time has arrived to give the people a better 
life. The time for a change is at hand. Today, our people sent 
a message to the guardians of the old politics. [Words 
indistinct] not along the old, eroded road. We will outline a 
new course. The vote of the humblest of our fellow countrymen 
has the same value as that of the most powerful and privileged. 
The message [applause] is that we are the masters of our own 
destiny. 
  The message is clear. Do not let yourselves be guided by the 
great but empty rhetoric. [Words indistinct] because it is 
backed by a specific, serious, and consistent program to create 
new and better jobs, stimulate investment and industry, rescue 
the rural areas and peasants from neglect, lend to those who 
wish to start their own business, give the benefit of potable 
water to more than 10 million Colombians, [applause] build 
360,000 new social interest homes, carry out the great 
educational reforms that will give all Colombians an opportunity 
to prepare themselves and succeed in the difficult and 
competitive world that awaits them at the turn of the 21st 
century. 
  [Words indistinct] material welfare but with the soul and 
our 
nation. We oppose the legalization of drugs in any form. 
[applause] This has been, is, and will continue to be my 
position; the same position I have maintained for 15 years, the 
one I will continue to maintain as president of all Colombians. 
[applause] We must set one goal: not to tolerate drugs, drug 
trafficking, the consumption of drugs, or narcoterrorism. This 
will not happen overnight or in a couple of months. But this is 
the path we must take and the one we must seek.

<F P=106> [Report by Orlando Cano Vallejo] </F>
  [Text] Presidential candidate Antonio Navarro Wolff has 
just made some remarks on the election. Navarro, also former 
health minister, said the candidates who lead in the 29 May 
elections have phoned him. Navarro said Colombians acted 
decently in the election by voting for him in a larger number 
than anticipated, considering the complications that his 
campaign encountered regarding the other leading candidates, 
Ernesto Samper Pizzano and Andres Pastrana Arango. Tacitly 
responding to the media, Navarro Wolff admitted that Samper and 
Pastrana are ahead of him, and that on 2 June, he will make 
specific remarks on the course he will set for his political 
campaign, whether he will join any of the two candidates or 
remain an independent candidate, what he describes as a pebble 
in the shoe. Navarro said he has received numerous calls from 
his followers, who also [words indistinct] one of the two 
candidates, whose name he withheld. 
  The official report says Navarro Wolff will meet with his 
party's leadership on 2 June, when he will announce whether or 
not he will back one of the two candidates. He told Caracol 
Network that both Samper and Pastrana have phoned him but that 
any decision for either of the two candidates will be announced 
on 2 June in a closed-door meeting with the directors of his 
political campaign.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with presidential candidates Ernesto </F>
Samper of the Liberal Party, Andres Pastrana of the Conservative 
Party, and Antonio Navarro Wolff of the April 19 Movement 
Democratic Alliance by Dario Arizmendi and unidentified 
reporters in Santa Fe de Bogota; from the "Caracol's 0600 to 
0900" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Arizmendi] Dr. Ernesto Samper, thank you very much 
for being with the Caracol Network of Colombia this morning. 
Antonio Navarro Wolff is also on the line. Good morning. 
  [Samper] Good morning, Antonio. 
  [Navarro] How are you doing? 
  [Arizmendi] Dr. Samper, how do you assess the election 
results? 
  [Samper] Dario, I am very pleased with them. They speak for 
themselves. I think it is clear that people in the major 
cities, where the most independent and less committed votes are, 
voiced their opinions. That was the case in Bogota, Cali, 
Barranquilla, and Bucaramanga. Their votes favored us and they 
also favored Antonio Navarro. 
  Most of the votes cast for Dr. Pastrana came from areas 
traditionally considered to be conservative. It does not 
surprise me that he won in the Departments of Caldas, Narino, 
and Northern Santander. I admit that Conservatives voted more 
massively there just as the Liberals voted massively in the 
departments that are traditionally liberal. The Conservative 
machinery favored the Conservative candidate and others favored 
me and my ticket partner Humberto de la Calle, and they also 
favored Antonio Navarro. 
  [Arizmendi] Dr. Navarro, do you agree with Dr. Samper's 
assessment? 
  [Navarro] I see something that perhaps Dr. Samper has not 
analyzed. The Liberal Party made an all out effort to win in 
the first round. A few hours before the elections, Former 
President Dr. Alfonso Lopez predicted there would be a knockout. 
That did not happen. I think that there was a technical tie. 
This result deserves an in-depth analysis with electoral 
figures in hand. 
  I think that abstention was high. This is another fact that 
we must take into account. Abstention could be even higher 
during the runoff. This could reflect a lack of voter interest 
in political options, especially the most favored ones during 
the first round. That is the result of polarization. 
Yesterday's decision was virtually reduced to two choices. 
  I would say this tie created a complicated situation for 
both 
presidential candidates. Each one has his own reasons and 
possibilities, but I think the key to salvation during the 
runoff -- and this was determined yesterday by the support 
received by each participant -- [pauses] it is now important to 
listen to the voice of minority groups, which were not heard 
very much during the final part of the campaign in view of the 
polarization that was created. 
  [Arizmendi] Dr. Navarro, in this first public flirting with 
Dr. Ernesto Samper, would you tell us on what bases you would be 
willing to hold talks to present your basic proposals next 
Thursday before the 400 or 500 people who will be coming to 
discuss precisely what position should be adopted toward the two 
candidates? 
  [Navarro] Let us give it another name. This is not flirting 
but a friendly exchange. Regardless of what the electoral 
result might be, I hope to maintain a friendly relationship with 
Dr. Samper. I think we will make a decision after very calm 
reflection and after consulting many people. We have the 
responsibility of representing 220,000 people who heroically 
voted for us and against the establishment. We must genuinely 
represent those 220,000 people, and, thus, we will first consult 
and listen to many people before taking even one step forward. 
  [Arizmendi] Yes Dr. Samper? 
  [Samper] Well, I think Dr. Navarro explained his view very 
well. Of course, he has won an important opportunity. I have 
always felt a third political force is needed and that an 
opportunity should be given to an option other than the Liberal 
and Conservative options. I think he has every right to summon 
the people and I think there should be broad discussion. I am 
sure, because I have known Antonio Navarro for many years, that 
he will not make that decision by thinking of short-term 
considerations but of long-term considerations with regard to 
the support for the project of political opening, as the one 
that has been carried out since the new constitution. 
  Dario, a topic that we should highlight is that of the 
abstention rate. The fact is that we are moving from a 
representative democracy to a direct democracy as a result of 
the new Constitution. We have to continue working for the 
development of the structures that were established in the 
Constitution. Citizens' participation does not only mean 
electoral participation, but also political and social 
participation, which is what will finally enable this country to 
have a much stronger democracy. 
  [Arizmendi] We inform our listeners and Drs. Ernesto Samper 
Pizano and Antonio Navarro that we are going to welcome Dr. 
Andres Pastrana Arango now. Good morning Dr. Pastrana. 
  [Pastrana] Good morning, Dario. 
  [Arizmendi] Colombians and Drs. Samper and Navarro are 
listening to you. We are very happy to have you again on Latin 
America's first radio network after yesterday's election results. 
  [Pastrana] Dario, I am also very happy and pleased to be 
back 
on Radio Caracol. Permit me to greet Ernesto Samper and Antonio 
Navarro and to congratulate them. Yesterday, we held a 
first-rate democratic election. Let me congratulate Ernesto, 
Antonio, Regina Betancourt, General Maza, and each and every 
candidate who participated in yesterday's elections. I wanted 
to personally greet you Dario but I have an interview at 0900 
with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, a man who you know has a 
lot to teach us with regard to the topic of peace. In any case, 
I wanted to greet you Dario and all my contenders, wishing them 
luck and success. We have to work hard these next three weeks. 
  [Arizmendi] Thank you Dr. Pastrana for your gesture. I want 
to invite you to come tomorrow to our studios or to talk with us 
over the telephone from your house at 0730. We can talk at 
length about yesterday's elections and the future. 
  [Pastrana] I will be there Dario. I would have liked to be 
there right now. Thank you for the invitation, so tomorrow I 
will be talking with all Colombians. 
  [Arizmendi] Well sir, we will wait for you at 0730. Very 
nice of you to accept; have a good day, and thank you very much. 
  [Arizmendi] It is 0834 and we continue with Dr. Samper and 
Antonio Navarro. Dr. Samper, what happened with the Liberals 
who did not vote with the sufficient zeal and profession for 
your party to win in the first round? 
  [Samper] I feel I received a significant portion of the 
Liberal vote. One cannot regard this in absolute terms but in 
terms of a comparison between the congressional and presidential 
elections. Liberal leaders were able to get in yesterday's votes 
the same number of votes they got in the congressional 
elections. Of course, we still have to summon many Liberal 
sectors. In some strife-torn areas, public order problems 
hampered the vote of certain Liberal municipalities, like 
Bolivar and the municipalities in the Santander and Norte de 
Santander Departments. At any rate, I think Liberals are going 
to be much more efficient in the runoff. 
  [Reporter] If one looks at what the Liberal and Conservative 
Parties have been historically, one realizes Pastrana got the 
vote of the Conservative party and others who rallied around his 
program, personality, or any other reason. Others who are not 
in the Conservative party joined that campaign. The same thing 
did not happen with you because all the Liberal Party did not 
vote for you, and your Alliance for Colombia group did not yield 
results, it seems. 
  [Samper] On the contrary, if we did not have the support 
from 
sectors that make up the Alliance for Colombia, the amount of 
votes would have been less. 
  I do not think the independent vote went to Dr. Pastrana. I 
respectfully tell you, I repeat that such a vote was 
concentrated in the big cities and the big cities voted for our 
ticket. I do admit that, initially, the vote was proportionally 
greater for Dr. Pastrana's Conservative machine. It can also be 
the case that in certain regions, such as the coffee region, 
there could have been a protest vote, a vote that went to Dr. 
Pastrana [words indistinct] there are surprises. I repeat, if 
one looks at the figures, department by department, one would 
see that there was no change to the historical trend. It was 
not a case that those who were Liberal Party supporters became 
Conservative. What happened is that there was a great 
Conservative vote turnout in favor of Dr. Pastrana and to this, 
we must add the vote of support by regions especially affected 
by the crisis in the agricultural sector. 
  [Arizmendi] One must suppose that there will be changes in 
strategy or perhaps a readjustment or a strengthening of the 
leadership positions within the campaign. When will you make a 
decision in this regard? 
  [Samper] We will analyze the figures this week. We will 
establish contact with the regions. We will summon those who 
have been supporting us. The idea is to make decisions which, 
of course, will not change the strategy much. This week's polls 
predicted a virtual tie which is just what happened in the end. 
Of course, we would have preferred to win in the first 
elections, as Navarro said. It was not possible, however. This 
gives minorities the opportunity to seek an understanding in 
order to have a great majority in the next round of elections. I 
think this is democratic. Runoff elections have that virtue. I 
am obviously willing to form that majority seeking an agreement 
with all the sectors that participated in yesterday's elections. 
  [Arizmendi] Dr. Samper, obviously the answer to as crude a 
question as the following will not be easy, but what arguments 
and bureaucratic reasons are you planning to use to convince 
Navarro Wolff to support you? 
  [Samper] I do not expect to use bureaucratic reasons to 
convince Navarro Wolff to support me. I think this is out of 
the question because the truth is I have never reached political 
understandings on the basis of giving out bureaucratic 
positions. I think Antonio Navarro has never done so throughout 
his political career. We are responsible for making this 
country work on the basis of programmatic and ideological 
coalitions. It is not a matter of bureaucratic positions, but 
rather ideological and doctrinaire positions. I am confident we 
will have the chance to reach an understanding with Antonio 
Navarro in this arena. 
  [Arizmendi] Dr. Navarro, are you willing to form a 
programmatic and ideological alliance on the basis of some 
principles with Dr. Ernesto Samper, or are you also willing to 
reach a kind of governability pact with his political group, 
should he win the 19 June elections? 
  [Navarro Wolff] [Reporter says communication was lost] 
  [Arizmendi] Unfortunately, we lost communication with Dr. 
Navarro. Let us go on with Dr. Samper. Dr. Samper, as for the 
29 May elections, there are two greatly talked-about issues: 
Are you going to maintain your emphasis on economic openings 
and the agricultural sector? Do you believe it is necessary to 
advocate more definite policies in such areas as coffee 
production and urban development? 
  [Samper] I think we must put an emphasis on the countryside. 
I think part of the profound crisis that was clearly expressed 
yesterday by the municipalities is that there is a profound 
agricultural crisis as never before seen in Colombian history. 
This is why for the past year, I have been alerting the 
government and authorities on the risks of failing to address 
this agricultural crisis, which the subversion has helped 
amplify. 
  [Arizmendi] Finally Dr. Samper, I thank you for these 
statements to the Caracol Radio Network despite your staying up 
all night, the parties, the expectations, the tension, and the 
intensity with which you lived yesterday's events. There are 
many Liberal leaders -- I insist on the word many -- who were 
very upset with the campaign yesterday because the politicians 
believe they were ignored and not taken seriously. Are they 
going to be taken into account during these runoff elections? 
  [Samper] I have always been in direct contact with Liberal 
leaders. We appreciate their work, support, and participation. 
We, the independent and uncompromised sectors and the sectors 
that do not operate through the traditional Liberal and 
Conservative parties, have been working hard. We will continue 
with this strategy and we hope to count on the leaders' support 
and understanding to ensure that they will gather the votes of 
the so-called Liberal active membership. We believe our 
responsibility lies in enticing the new sectors that can support 
our Liberal plan, and we expect to achieve this goal. 
  [Arizmendi] You have also reported that it seems some 
Conservative politicians purchased votes in Atlantico 
Department. Will you file a report? 
  [Samper] We have very distressing reports on an alleged vote 
purchase in Atlantico Department. I will personally investigate 
these reports this morning because any vote-purchasing 
accusation would be serious. I think it would be very adverse 
for this democratic process. 
  [Arizmendi] Finally, it is important to note the electoral 
results in Santa Fe de Bogota and their meaning to you and to 
the city's political present and future. How would you 
interpret your victory here in Santa Fe de Bogota? 
  [Samper] The first thing I see is that people put an end to 
the myth that the only mayor Santa Fe de Bogota had was Dr. 
Pastrana. The truth is that people responded generously and 
enthusiastically to the appeal we made. This position has a lot 
to do with the plans I have proposed for the city from the 
beginning. I committed myself to building the Santa Fe de Bogota 
subway, creating the Social Advisory Board [Consejeria Social] 
to coordinate government presence in the city, and relocating 
the Police. I believe this contributed to the vote of 
confidence the city gave me. As I said earlier, if there is a 
city where people voted without prior commitments it is Santa Fe 
de Bogota. People here never requested t-shirts, alcohol, or 
transportation; they only wanted a convincing message. This is 
what happened yesterday, and I am very pleased because in 
addition to those who voted for other candidates, the majority 
voted for us in Santa Fe de Bogota and other cities. 
  [Unidentified reporter] It was very kind of you to grant us 
this interview on your first impressions of the results of the 
elections.

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo </F>
in Santa Fe de Bogota on 27 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] Colombians: On Sunday, the nation will experience 
one its most important moments. It is, as we all know, the 
election of the person who will govern Colombia during the next 
four years. The person to whom I will surrender power on 7 
August will receive a mandate from his fellow citizens, a 
mandate -- like the one I received when I assumed the office of 
president in 1990 -- that obliges and commits him during his 
administration to seek the welfare of his fellow citizens and a 
better future for Colombia. 
  That is why today, I want to devote a few minutes to speak 
to 
you about what I consider our duty to be next Sunday for 
Colombia, our children, and our children's children. The first 
thing I must say to each of you, to every Colombian who is 
listening, is that we must vote. We must vote with conviction, 
thinking about the nation's future. We must vote freely, 
thinking of our families' future. We must vote with solidarity, 
thinking of the needy in Colombia. We must vote with decision, 
thinking of the country's peace. But above all else, we must be 
clear that that vote, that simple action of getting up early in 
the morning and walking to the polling station, studying the 
ballot, and choosing each one's preferred candidate, will 
influence what happens to each resident of this country 
beginning on 7 August. 
  To not vote, in turn, leaves in the hands of those who vote 
our personal future, that of our children, our parents and 
brothers, and our dearly beloved fatherland, which has 
progressed so much, but which faces so many challenges now and 
in the future. 
  Therefore, I invite you to exercise this right, which is 
also 
a duty of every good citizen. By voting, we help build the 
future of Colombia. This nation has a strong democratic 
tradition, which today is applauded and recognized by the entire 
international community. There is no doubt Colombians have 
advanced a lot regarding citizens' participation and collective 
affairs of life. And there is no doubt our electoral 
organization is one of the most responsible and efficient in 
Latin America. This democratic tradition will be strengthened 
if we all vote, and above all, if we all support the National 
Civil Registry and respect the rules, some of which I will 
stress today categorically. 
  First, as has been reported, all forms of propaganda have 
been banned on the day of the elections. That is, in this 
election, as happens today in most civilized nations, no 
political propaganda will be allowed, neither moving, nor still, 
nor audio propaganda. In other words, wearing propaganda 
t-shirts, using loudspeakers, or putting up posters or 
billboards about the elections or candidates will not be 
permitted. 
  Second, this process requires that the media act responsibly 
and that they respect the legal provisions. The government will 
not hesitate -- hear me right -- the government will not 
hesitate to punish exemplarily radio stations or television 
concessionaires who break the rules. The media cannot broadcast 
interviews with political-electoral intentions, propaganda, 
opinion shows, news conferences on election day. They can only 
provide information on electoral results from electoral 
officials at polling stations, the National Civil Registry, and 
its branches. When reporting on partial information, the media 
must inform the official electoral source. And the media will 
not be able, under the risk of facing penalties that may lead to 
the cancellation of the license and concession, to divulge 
projections or polls on electoral results. 
  Finally, regarding public order, the media will only be able 
to report information confirmed by official sources. What is 
more important for news neutrality is that the media will not be 
allowed to reproduce results issued by international news 
agencies abroad or the projections made by them on the vote 
because it would adversely affect the provisions of neutrality. 
  Third, this process requires the absolute impartiality of 
public employees. Yesterday, the prosecutor general warned 
government officials about the severe sanctions the Prosecutor 
General's Office will impose on those who violate the legal 
norms on impartiality or use in some way public property in 
favor of any candidate. 
  Presidential delegates, whose mission is to observe the 
normal development of the elections throughout the entire 
national territory have been sent to all departments of 
Colombia. Believe me, the government will persecute and punish 
those who do not observe the legal norms. 
  Fellow countrymen, allow me one final observation on the 
elections. We must vote to give a signal to the enemies of 
peace in Colombia, the violent ones, those who have missed the 
train of history because they have not had the courage to leave 
behind their cowardly rifles, attacks, kidnappings, extortions, 
and their obsolete rhetoric. This message must be heard by 
them. It must say that the Colombian people demand peace and 
demand attitudes of peace. It must say, above all, that the 
people of Colombia support the good things, teamwork, and that 
they support our future. 
  A copy of an old newspaper, which was in the hands of our 
ancestors in 1884, some 100 years ago, quotes a phrase mentioned 
by Simon Bolivar which I believe summarizes what we must all 
seek on Sunday when we go out to exercise our right to elect a 
president. Bolivar said: I would trade all my dictates and 
titles, even that of liberator, for that of a good citizen. If 
all 30 million Colombians are good citizens, like Bolivar said, 
if we are good citizens, we will undoubtedly elect a president, 
who will always seek a more just, equitable, prosperous, and 
peaceful fatherland for our good and for the welfare of the new 
generations of Colombians. Good night and thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Report by Edward Amaya from the "Cripton" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Andres Pastrana, presidential candidate for the 
Conservative Party, spent some time with the foreign press this 
morning. He spoke of the need to reinforce commercial relations 
between our country and the United States. According to the 
candidate, relations between the two nations should not revolve 
around drug trafficking alone. 
  [Begin Pastrana recording] We cannot continue to maintain 
relations based solely on the issue of drug trafficking. Trade 
between the two countries is on the rise, and I believe it is 
important for us and for the United States to reinforce that 
commercial trade, increase our participation, and not continue 
to base our relationship on drug trafficking alone. [end 
recording] 
  Foreign correspondents from the United States, Mexico, 
Argentina, and Spain met this morning with Andres Pastrana and 
Luis Fernando Ramirez. During the encounter, Pastrana affirmed 
that a peace process must begin with the insurgent groups during 
the next administration. 
  [Begin Pastrana recording] When there is a will for peace, 
peace can be attained. We have already seen this in Medellin 
with the People's Militias, who demonstrated their desire for 
peace, and the peace was signed. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Statement by Andres Pastrana, presidential candidate for </F>
the Colombian Conservative Party; place and date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] Friends: This has been an extraordinary campaign for 
all of us. It has been a trip to the future, a trip of our 
hearts and souls. All over the country, amid both problems and 
hopes, I have sensed a strong desire for change. I can tell you 
the time has come. I have seen it in the faces of Colombians, 
men and women, children, youths, and elderly people, from La 
Guajira to Narino and from the Pacific to the Amazon. They have 
said it: Colombia's time is here. I have sensed that desire for 
change in the hands I have shaken and in the people's embrace. 
They have said it; you say it; and I say it: Colombia's time is 
here. 
  This has not been simply a candidate's campaign. This 
campaign has been inspired by one cause: Making Colombia a 
country of opportunities, putting an end to the vices of the old 
policy and starting a head-on struggle against poverty, whose 
shadow has been following us for some time. 
  As president, I will struggle to have a strong economy, not 
only for the good of the economy itself, but for your personal 
well-being, our people's well-being. The success of our 
economic policy will not only be determined by the cold 
statistical figures; it will be determined by the number of good 
jobs with good salaries and by the higher standard of living all 
Colombians will have. Our economic plan is aimed at creating 
more jobs; not any type of jobs, but well-paid jobs, which is 
the way all Colombians can achieve real well-being. This will 
require a strategy to produce more and increase our exports, 
encouraging and supporting the initiatives of many of you as 
creators of enterprises, micro-enterprises, and sources of jobs. 
  That plan will be a fragile task unless we resolutely attack 
inflation, which has become the most costly and unjust indirect 
tax for all Colombians, particularly for the poor because it 
makes the family basket more expensive and has become the reason 
for daily anguish. We are all paying too much to survive. This 
is the time to change that situation. I will reduce inflation 
to 9 percent. Other countries have done it, and we can do it 
too. We want our people to earn salaries with which they can 
pay for public utilities, bus fares, and food. In other words, 
it is to improve their purchasing power. In order to achieve 
that goal, my government will exercise healthy fiscal 
discipline. In other words, I commit myself to making sure my 
administration does not incur excessive expenses and uses funds 
wisely. I will assume the responsibility of carefully handling 
public expenses to control the inflationary pressure and fight 
revaluation. 
  I have reiterated that the Cusiana oil well is an excellent 
opportunity to invest in our people and in infrastructure if we 
make good use of that extra income. It is like winning the 
lottery; the winner can either waste the money in one night of 
fun or can make good use of it by expanding his business, 
sending his children to study, or making improvements in his 
house. 
  As president, I will prevent the squandering of those 
resources. They will be spent in house construction, education, 
health, and the well-being of all of you. The petroleum of 
Colombia belongs to the people of Colombia and the benefits of 
petroleum must go to their owners, that is, all Colombians. 
  I have assumed a clear commitment with farmers and cattlemen 
to ensure that their activity becomes good business again. The 
countryside has been hit hard. We will rescue the countryside by 
restoring peace and by offering new technology, better marketing 
mechanisms, and better financing systems. I will lend a hand to 
coffee growers because they generously lent a hand to Colombia 
in the past and because coffee continues to be important to the 
country's future. 
  We will consolidate the opening process, but under the 
unquestionable premise that it should bring new opportunities 
for Colombians, with greater social justice. We cannot resign 
ourselves to less. We will ensure that its contributions to 
economic growth reach a great majority of Colombians and ensure 
that it will not reach the same few hands. 
  I have always been convinced, and I have confirmed this 
lately during my direct contact with Colombians, that more than 
investing in specific projects, we must invest in our people. A 
country of opportunities is a country that demands investments 
in training, retraining, and education. 
  I have heard some say that the benefits of investing in 
these 
aspects are evident only in the distant future. I say that the 
economic and social future of Colombia is defined in the 
present. Those who assure that it is possible to have more and 
better jobs without training, retraining, and education are 
ill-informed, or what is worse, are deceiving the people. 
  Countries such as Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore have followed 
this path. They achieved a surprising growth rate in a very 
short time. Not many years ago, I visited those countries, and 
their standard of living was very inferior to ours. They are 
now clearly ahead of us. 
  In this regard, and in specific terms, what we should do and 
what will be done under my leadership as president is the 
following: offer incentives to businessmen for training and 
retraining workers. We will retrain 2 million workers in the 
next four years. We will offer training in the evening to those 
who work during the day to ensure that they increase their 
capabilities and knowledge and also to ensure that they are able 
to obtain a better job with higher pay. We will offer training 
to farmers to ensure that they become more productive and more 
efficient and become countryside businessmen. 
  My project to invest in our children and youths is not a 
long-term goal. It is an urgent priority. We must guarantee 
primary and secondary education to more than 1.9 million youths 
who do not have it today. We must also guarantee preschool 
education to 700,000 children. This ambitious project, which 
costs 500 billion pesos, would be financed with resources of the 
fiscal [word indistinct] and the nation's regular revenues that 
the municipalities have a right to receive. 
  May I remind those who insist on criticizing large 
investments in education that the cost of ignorance is greater. 
We would lose talent, jobs, and economic growth; we would 
undermine our ability to compete; and we would be overlooking 
the fact that education is the starting point of authentic 
equality. 
  There can be no certainty of a future if we fail to protect 
our natural resources that are being increasingly depleted day 
after day -- our forests, water, and soil. Development must be 
sustainable if we want to ensure that it is human. We must 
become the guardians of this wealth, which is a legacy for 
future generations. 
  Perhaps the most complex part of my job as mayor was the 
handling of narcoterrorism, which not only hit political leaders 
and the powerful who find protection more easily, but common 
citizens, who could become the next victim of uncontrolled 
violence at any time. Today, violence and insecurity still 
prevail throughout the country, claiming lives every day and 
building fear among Colombians. It is difficult to convince 
investors to risk their opportunities in a virtual war zone. 
  We have made some progress in the last few years. A 
Colombia under the stigma and threat of violence, however, will 
always be a nation that will not be able to fully develop its 
economic and human potential. As president, I will spare no 
effort and I pledge to do everything within my reach to ensure 
that peace and harmony will blossom again in all the corners of 
the country, because our families, our parents, and our children 
are the foundations of society. We must live again free from 
threats of violence, drug trafficking, and drugs. 
  We need more strength and perseverance in the fight against 
fear and violence. We must not fear fear itself. The 
guerrillas and terrorists struck a diabolical alliance. As 
president, I will not hesitate to enforce the law. I already 
told the country that the government does not choose between war 
and peace; the government's responsibility is to respect the 
institutions and to defend the lives of Colombians. This 
responsibility leaves no room for arguments and focuses the 
government's unavoidable attitude on fighting subversion. 
  Should the guerrillas want peace, they must prove it with 
facts rather than with empty remarks and simple rhetorical 
speeches. Should they be willing to do this, I will be glad to 
personally negotiate with those who have taken up arms, with a 
positive attitude and without shirking my duties. This is the 
broadest hope a ruler can offer. Should the guerrillas maintain 
their current attitude, however, I will exert authority without 
hesitation because it is my duty. I am a friend of peace, yet I 
refuse to engage in fruitless talks, as previous presidents did. 
As they became frustrated, our fellow countrymen lost faith and 
confidence. 
  I will reinforce the Armed Forces and the Police to make 
them 
into a professional army. I will end the compulsory draft, and 
I will invest in military intelligence to effectively combat 
those who insist on destabilizing the institutions and making 
attempts on the lives and patrimony of Colombians. I am 
determined to strongly repress drug trafficking, dirty money, 
and corruption, (?with) the moral authority our liberator once 
dreamed of. I will try to make Colombia the moral country the 
immense majority wants. At the same time, I will fight the 
socioeconomic causes that triggered the spread of these scourges 
and drug consumption in Colombia. You can be sure of one thing: 
I will support neither the legalization of drugs, nor its 
production, commercialization, or consumption. This flat-out 
defiance was and will always be my position. This position is 
not new for me; I have always thought like this because I 
believe that drugs consumed 15 years ago were as harmful for our 
youths as the ones currently consumed. 
  We must all commit ourselves to rescue our countryside, 
cities, streets, and thoroughfares from criminal hands in order 
to reestablish harmony among the citizenry. We will create 
specialized groups to rid the country of mafias made up of 
apartment thieves [apartamenteros], car thieves [jaladores], and 
all types of thugs, starting in large cities. 
  To close my speech, which is being televised for the benefit 
of the Colombian people, I will speak from my heart. A long 
battle is about to end, and I hope everything that previously 
divided us is left behind and that we work together to achieve a 
united fatherland. I have tried not to focus on my contenders' 
mistakes. If they hurt me, the wounds are already healed. I 
sincerely extend my friendly hand to all those who sought to be 
democratically elected by recognizing that their messages were 
impregnated with love for Colombia, a Colombia we all agree must 
be better and fairer. 
  Someday when this campaign is long forgotten, I want it to 
be 
said that we embarked on it full of love for Colombia, trusting 
that our efforts would help it progress. Moreover, I want it to 
be said that we did not alter the faith in and the loyalty to 
our principles and that we attempted to display the best 
feelings of our population in my actions and words. We hurt no 
fellow countrymen. Our unalterable objective was to join efforts 
toward accomplishing a common national goal. We were determined 
to make our presidential term the crusade to ready our country 
for entering the threshold of progress and reconciliation as we 
approach the new century. 
  I believe a president's mission is to fight to ensure that 
each one of us has a job and an income. I believe the struggle 
for the well-being of all of us within the framework of peace 
must constitute a president's daily struggles. I also believe 
the next president's efforts will focus on fighting for a 
Colombia full of opportunities. This is why I am currently 
seeking your mandate. Your needs and expectations will become 
the yardstick for my decisions. I will strive to build a 
country, a government, and an economy that will reflect the 
kindness, honesty, and strength of our people. I cannot promise 
you everything, but I can promise you one thing: Should you 
decide to give me an opportunity, with God's blessings and help, 
I will not fail you. With our vote, let us make Sunday [29 May] 
the day to forge the Colombia we all dream of. Good evening.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 27 May (EFE) -- Presidential 
candidate Ernesto Samper favors maintaining an open policy, 
initiated by current President Cesar Gaviria, toward Cuba, 
indicating he will not sponsor measures against the Cuban 
people. "I will not sponsor measures that go against the Cuban 
people such as the embargo provided for by the Torricelli Bill. 
I will continue relations with Cuba, initiated by President 
Gaviria. Although we may not agree, as we do not with some 
aspects of the Cuban political system, while the island's 
government does not meddle in Colombia's internal matters, we 
will support these relations." 
  During an exclusive interview with EFE, Samper, one of the 
two candidates leading the polls for the up-coming presidential 
elections, expressed his opinion on some current international 
issues. Here are some excerpts. 
<H5>  Guerrillas </H5>
  The guerrilla top brass is still politically motivated. We 
must seek a dialogue because we cannot accept this being used to 
engage in political proselytizing. The day I sit down at the 
negotiating table it will be because I am certain the process 
will achieve something. In the past few years, there were six 
attempts to negotiate that ended in nothing. I will not make 
this error. The peace I achieve will be permanent. 
  Meanwhile, my peace proposal is based on continuing the 
modernization process in the Armed Forces, complemented by a 
greater effort in the intelligence field and conceived within 
respect for human rights. Likewise, some minimum commitments to 
humanize the war must be established with the rebels in order 
not to adversely affect the civilian population. Peace will be 
achieved, not only with the persuasive presence of weapons, but 
also with the state's dissuasive presence, jobs, and agriculture 
development in the areas of violence. 
<H5>  Human Rights </H5>
  I will not say that there are no human rights violations in 
Colombia, because there are. Nevertheless, we are the country 
that made more institutional efforts to control these, as is 
acknowledged by international organizations. We have a 
Presidential Advisory Human Rights Committee; we have human 
rights departments in the universities and schools; we have 
developed within the Army a profound campaign with regard to 
human rights.... The nation is concerned and conscious of the 
problem. One must not forget that we are at war with the 
guerrillas. In a war, the rights of those who are against the 
government, as well as the rights of the government forces, can 
be violated. The violations carried out by the guerrillas must 
be investigated. 
<H5>  Economic Opening </H5>
  We will not do an about face; we will not eliminate the 
reduction of barriers; we will not change the regulations on 
foreign investment; and we will not give up what has been gained 
in the field of mobilization in the labor market. We must 
progress in infrastructure and technology as necessary 
supplements to the internationalization process of the economy 
and make a great effort in social investment. 
  The model of radical opening applied several years ago is 
being revised in all Latin America in the wake of the events in 
Chiapas. This set off an alarm, sounding an alert on the 
neoliberal model of savage capitalism. Neoliberalism was causing 
enormous social devastation; Chiapas is the clearest indication 
that the pendulum is returning. Although we are not going to 
return to the old protectionism models of the 60's, we are 
currently in a situation that forces us to preserve the social 
damage of the neoliberal model. Either the powerful nations 
create jobs, apply controls on development and subsidy policies 
for the agriculture sectors, or we will be condemned to 
outbreaks of violence as in Chiapas, Caracas, or Peru. True 
social outbreaks could occur that could do away with all the 
democratic systems. 
<H5>  Drug Legalization </H5>
  Fifteen years ago when I proposed drug legalization, this 
problem was reduced to the marijuana plantations in the Sierra 
Nevada of Santa Marta. At that time, my theory was to give the 
peasants the possibility to substitute their crops and leave 
behind drugs. What was done was to increase the pressure and to 
spray the plantations. From marijuana, we went to cocaine, from 
cocaine to drug trafficking, and from drug trafficking to 
narcoterrorism. Currently drug legalization is not feasible in 
Colombia. It would be seen as an amnesty, as a pardon for all 
that has occurred in the nation in the past 15 years. This does 
not mean that the international arguments I then outlined do not 
continue to hold true. Drug consuming nations are not making 
significant efforts to reduce drug consumption nor to control 
money laundering. Until there is world-wide legalization, 
Colombia's obligation is to more firmly demand that the consumer 
nations make a greater effort. 
<H5>  Drug Trafficking and Economy </H5>
  Drug trafficking is what makes the opening process in 
Colombia difficult. It is being used to destabilize the source 
of capital, and it is also destabilizing the opening and 
importation process. We cannot ignore that with these mechanisms 
of free exchange and free trade, some hot money from drug 
trafficking, seeking to become legitimate, have infiltrated. 
  One must be careful with regard to the issue of exchange 
revenues, and we must partially reestablish customs because we 
have practically dismantled them. An opening process is very 
simple. Imports are allowed, with the monetary margin obtained; 
the use of dollars is created; exports are devaluated and 
stimulated; and with this more imports are purchased. Here we 
only went halfway. We allowed imports and the entrance of 
capital. Large amounts of speculative capital arrived forcing 
us to revaluate our currency. With this revaluation we have held 
back exports. This adversely affects jobs, agriculture, and 
industries, because in an open economy revaluation does away 
with everything. 
<H5>  Latin American Integration </H5>
  I am convinced that in the coming years, we should pass from 
the stage of free trade agreements to the stage of attempting 
the integration process once again. It is fine to sign free 
trade agreements, but the time has come for integration. Not 
the integration we had 20 years ago, toward the inside, creating 
a sort of wall so that no one could come. Rather, it is an 
integration toward the outside, as is being seen in other parts 
of the world with the forming of trade blocks, such as the 
European or Asian blocks. Latin America must take up the 
integration issue once again if it wants to negotiate in 
conditions of comparative advantage all the free trade 
agreements ready to be signed, not only within the hemisphere 
but also in other economic regions of the world. Here is where 
I see the important advantage of integration.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 28 May (EFE) -- At least six 
people, including one policeman, one soldier, and one civilian, 
were killed today in three different guerrilla actions in 
Colombia, the day before the presidential elections. At the 
same time, the authorities decided to suspend elections in 12 
small communities in the Simiti Municipality, Bolivar 
Department, in the northern Colombia, due to guerrilla threats. 
  A Defense Ministry source said the most serious incident 
took 
place in a rural area known as Caguan, in southern Colombia, 
when a group of insurgents attacked and murdered a policeman, a 
soldier, and a woman. In this clash, one of the rebels was 
killed. He belonged to the communist Revolutionary Armed Forces 
of Colombia (FARC). 
  Near Baraya, in Huila Department, also in southern Colombia, 
a rebel was killed and two more were captured at a military 
checkpoint, when they tried to attack the troops. The same 
source reported that in the Uraba area, in Colombia's northeast, 
the Army foiled an attack against a police garrison in Carepa, 
where one guerrilla was killed. 
  Electoral authorities decided to suspend elections in 12 
small communities in the Simiti Municipality. Simiti Mayor 
Elias Escalante said the decision to suspend the elections was 
made because the presence of guerrillas did not allow National 
Civil Registry (an organization in charge of the elections) 
delegates to go to these small communities. Simiti is located 
about 900 km north of Santa Fe de Bogota. 
  On Sunday, Colombians will elect President Cesar Gaviria's 
successor from among 18 candidates, even though runoff elections 
on 19 June will probably need to be held because it is unlikely 
any of the candidates will reach an absolute majority according 
to previous polls.

  [Text] The presidential elections are just getting started 
in Segovia, delayed by the mysterious disappearance of Damian 
Orlando Alvarez Cerna, municipal registrar. This occurred 
between last night and early today at that northeastern 
Antioquia mining site. Department and Segovia authorities, who 
fear that the official has been kidnapped, have reported that he 
was last seen early Saturday night. Today his apartment was 
found empty. 
  The authorities added that around that same time, members of 
the outlawed National Army of Liberation raided the police post 
in the Fraguas community where they stole documents assigned to 
the two voting tables. Given these events, the department's 
Registry Office appointed two of its officials in Medellin, who 
were immediately transferred by a National Police helicopter. 
The two registrars, one of them [name indistinct], were granted 
special powers, while being supplied with additional 
documentation to replace what was stolen in Fraguas. Department 
Registrar Hector Arango Morales told Caracol that, despite the 
difficulties, the elections will be closed at 1600. To speed up 
the process the designated officials were given instructions to 
increase the 27 tables originally provided for in the urban 
areas and, if necessary, those of the rural areas. 
  Ruben Dario Jaramillo, Antioquia's ombudsman, joined the 
protests against what had occurred in Segovia, while urging 
those who have knowledge of Mr. Vasquez [name as heard] Cerna's 
whereabouts to respect the official's life and release him.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 30 May (AFP) -- This Monday, 
Army of National Liberation (ELN) guerrillas ambushed and killed 
Santiago Angarita, a community leader in the Colombian town of 
Convencion, Norte de Santander, from whom the rebels seized 
voting cards from this Sunday's presidential elections and 
burned them. 
  Radio reports from Santa Fe de Bogota stated Angarita was 
intercepted on his way to the National Civil Registry of Cucuta, 
a provincial capital bordering Venezuela. The guerrillas 
stripped Angarita of the sealed ballot box and then killed him. 
  The community leader transported the votes cast at the 
Municipalities of San Jose, Las Pitas, and Cartagenita and the 
town of Convencion. 
  Presidential elections held this Sunday in Colombia resulted 
in a virtual tie between Liberal Party candidate Ernesto Samper 
and Conservative Party candidate Andres Pastrana, who will vie 
in a runoff election on Sunday, 19 June.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda by </F>
Manuel Monsalve from the National Defense Ministry on 29 May -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Pardo] The preliminary assessment of the election 
process is that at the beginning of the day, there were some 
problems at some voting tables located in several 
municipalities. There were problems in 86 voting tables, but 
these were subsequently solved. The most common problem were 
those related to delegates not arriving on time. The voting 
process was halted while the delegate in charge was being 
replaced. In other cases, problems were mostly related to cases 
of vandalism -- very few cases -- mostly destruction of election 
material. We were able to observe problems [words indistinct] 
in the partial results we now have. These results will mostly 
be modified later on in practically 47 tables. I would like to 
state that there are more than 45,000 voting tables [words 
indistinct], and we only have had problems with less than 47 
tables. 
  [Monsalve] Which departments presented problems? 
  [Pardo] In Veredas [words indistinct] less than two tables, 
in 31 different communities. This did not undermine municipal 
elections, however, or those places where there were more than 
two tables. We were able to solve these problems. 
  [Monsalve] Mr. Minister, can you tell those Colombians who 
were able to vote in the departments where there were the most 
problems? 
  [Pardo] I repeat, the departments with the most problems 
were 
Bolivar, Norte de Santander, Santander, and Casanare. I repeat, 
however, these were mostly problems that appeared in those 
places where there were only one or two voting tables. [Words 
indistinct] places where the voter turnout is quite low. I 
expect to compare the information we now have on the 47 tables 
where there were problems, with those of the 47,000 tables 
distributed throughout the country. 
  [Monsalve] With respect to the 13 March voting process, 
would 
you say that security increased [words indistinct]? 
  [Pardo] Security, in comparison to 13 March, has increased 
greatly and is much tighter. In this case, there were fewer 
places affected. There were fewer incidents of voters being 
prevented from voting and fewer incidents of vandalism than on 
13 March.

  [Text] No elections have ever been so well protected in the 
country. At least, this is what the defense minister, who has 
set up a communications network throughout the country, has 
planned. The government has increased its military presence in 
the country's most conflict-ridden areas to prevent guerrilla 
threats from hampering Sunday's elections. 
  [Begin Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda recording] The 
Armed Forces are present at every municipality seat. 
Approximately 88 percent of the voting sites are covered, also. 
The Armed Forces are present at every location with more than 
three voting sites. This protection of the election process by 
the Public Force has been the most complete in the country's 
history. [end recording] 
  The minister said the Army's presence on the streets of 
Santa 
Fe de Bogota is due to the election process and not to the 
capital's security problems. 
  [Begin Pardo Rueda recording] The Army can cooperate with 
the 
police in the latter's work but cannot replace it. [end 
recording] 
  For election day, a communications system has been set up 
which will make it possible for authorities to act quickly and 
effectively if necessary.

<F P=106> [From the "Up-to-date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President Elect Armando Calderon Sol on Monday 
officially announced the names of the people to compose his 
cabinet. According to Calderon, the cabinet is composed of 
ideologists, technocrats, professionals, and businessmen, each 
of the sectors represented equally, in contrast with the cabinet 
of President Cristiani where businessmen were predominmant. 
  The new cabinet maintains some current cabinet officials. 
Others are well-known politicians, but there are many new faces. 
  Calderon will use some members of the Cristiani 
Administration in his cabinet. Minister of the Presidency Oscar 
Santamaria is staying as foreign minister. Defense Minister 
Humberto Corado, Education Minister Cecilia Cano, Norma de Dowe, 
the head of the National Reconstruction Secretariat, and Economy 
Minister Luis Enrique Cordoba will maintain their post. 
  Cristiani's cabinet was characterized by the presence of 
businessmen. The new president has said that his team will be 
well-balanced. 
  [Begin Calderon Sol recording] This includes politicians, 
technocrats, and professionals. We have tried to have a 
well-balanced and effective cabinet, a cabinet composed of 
honest and capable men and women. [end recording] 
  Hugo Barrera, a businessman, will be deputy public security 
minister. He will be facing one of the most important 
challenges of the future government. 
  [Begin Calderon Sol recording] He is well-accepted. He has a 
good reputation as a businessman. We want to give much emphasis 
to public security. We believe the people demand public 
security and full coverage of the National Civilian Police. 
[end recording] 
  Calderon Sol said that Vice President Enrique Borgo 
Bustamante will also be minister of the presidency. The 
interior minister will be Roberto Angulo, former president of 
the Salvadoran Parliament. The agriculture and livestock 
minister will be Carlos Mejia. Ricardo Montenegro, a 
businessman, will be finance minister. 
  Calderon Sol said that with this team he will continue the 
work initiated by President Cristiani, especially the social 
work. He disagreed with the church that Cristiani did not 
fulfill his promise to serve the poor. 
  [Begin Calderon recording] It has been evident that the 
level 
of poverty has dropped under the Cristiani administration. We 
have a big challenge in the social field, that of facing poverty 
and the national reconstruction effort. [end recording] 
  The autonomous institutions so far have confirmed Roberto 
Orellana as the head of the Central Reserve Bank. Juan Domenech 
will head the Natiaonal Administaration for Telecommunications. 
  Calderon Sol also announced that the national director of 
the 
National Civilian Police, Jose Maria Monterrey, has resigned but 
he did not report who will replace him.

  [Text] Dajabon, Dominican Republic, 27 May (EFE) -- The 
flow of individuals and vehicles across the Haitian-Dominican 
Republic border has been suspended. This seems to indicate that 
starting today, Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer is keeping 
his promise to implement the blockade imposed by the United 
Nations. 
  On Wednesday, Balaguer promised Dante Caputo, UN and OAS 
negotiator for Haiti, and William Grey, special U.S. envoy, that 
he would close the border completely, and yesterday, Balaguer 
met with his secretary of the Armed Forces, Lieutenant General 
Matos Villanueva. 
  Since early this morning, Dominican soldiers have been 
preventing the entry of Haitians through the border crossing at 
Dajabon, the Dominican town closest to Haitian territory. 
  The Dominican Government's efforts are also being supported 
by Haitian guards, who are preventing their fellow countrymen 
from getting closer than 700 meters to the border. As is common 
on Mondays and Fridays, these Haitians had planned to cross the 
border to buy and sell goods. In addition, hundreds of Haitians 
normally enter the Dominican Republic every day to buy fuel and 
take it back to Haiti. 
  The Dominican Armed Forces have increased the number of 
soldiers on the border to enforce the total closure of the 
border. The surveillance posts along the Dominican border are 
located every 10 meters and are now under the constant 
supervision of officers in vehicles. On the Haitian side, 
soldiers are also preventing their compatriots from crossing the 
Masacre River into the Dominican Republic. Since 0500, senior 
officers have been personally ensuring that "neither Haitians 
nor Dominicans" cross the border. 
  The parks and main streets in Dajabon also have been placed 
under military control. The closing of the border surprised the 
residents of Dajabon and hundreds of Dominicans who arrive from 
other cities to buy clothes, shoes, liquor, and arts and crafts 
from Haitians. It also affected Dominican merchants who travel 
up to 300 km to sell food to the Haitians. 
  A Dominican Army officer at one border post warned: "No one 
will be able to control these Haitians. When they are starving 
to death, they will want to cross the border, even if they get 
killed in the process."

  [Excerpt] In addition to the 36 Skyhawk A-4M planes already 
purchased from the United States, Argentina has decided to 
purchase four more of the planes. 
  The reason for increasing the purchase operation is that 
Argentina is interested in having inexpensive spare parts. If 
Argentina purchased spare parts on the international market, 
they would be more costly. 
  This has been confirmed by Defense Ministry sources who 
reported the existence of a letter Defense Minister Oscar 
Camilion sent to U.S. Ambassador James Cheek. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Havana, 29 May (PL) -- The Cuban Government today 
reaffirmed its categorical rejection of the illegal entrance to 
diplomatic offices in Havana as a means to abandon the country. 
  A press note issued at noon by the national television 
newscast referred to the forceful entrance by more than 100 
Cubans to the Belgian ambassador's residence on Saturday 
afternoon "to apply pressure tactics in order to leave the 
country." 
  It pointed out that "this new incident is nothing more than 
the result of provocations to commit illegal actions by 
counterrevolutionary stations that transmit from Miami, and 
especially the result of the restrictive policy implemented by 
the U.S. immigration authorities." 
  The United States, the note adds, "continues to obstruct the 
legal procedures of people interested in migrating to that 
country who, after failing several times, resort to illegal 
means, even violent ones, to achieve their goal." 
  The text, which was also aired by the radio stations, says 
that the Cuban Government has not prevented the departure from 
the island of people who complete their procedures legally. 
  Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said that the group 
occupying the Belgian diplomatic residence must leave that place 
"because pressure tactics and forceful means are not adequate 
mechanisms to leave Cuba." He pointed out that the island, in 
view of this incident, will maintain its usual position and that 
the Belgian authorities, being aware of the position toward such 
cases, should take the proper measures.

  [Text] Mexico City, 30 May (NOTIMEX) -- A group of 35 
youths from the solidarity group Let's Go for Cuba have staged a 
protest in front of the U.S. Embassy because of U.S. Senator 
Robert Torricelli's prescence in Mexico. 
  This Sunday, members of the organization displayed Mexican 
and Cuban flags and placed a coffin with an Uncle Sam dummy that 
would be burned bearing the words "Apply Article 33 (of the 
Constitution) to Torricelli." 
  The protesters explained that they burned the effigy to 
reject the democratic lawmaker's visit. Torricelli is 
well-known for his opposition to the signing of NAFTA as well as 
for promoting a tighter U.S. border and the Cuba Democracy Act 
establishing the commercial blockade against the island. 
  While the police guard remained alert, Jose Carrillo, main 
speaker at the "peaceful and symbolic demonstration," outlined 
the main points of the protest: "To declare Robert Torricelli 
persona non grata," an end of the 33-year-old U.S. blockade 
against Cuba, and the preferential sale of Mexican crude oil to 
the island. 
  Carrillo noted the historical solidarity between Mexico and 
Cuba and said that "to struggle for Cuba is to struggle for 
Mexico, dignity, independence, and sovereignty." He indicated 
that his group sent a letter to the Chamber of Deputies with 
13,000 signatures requesting the shipment "under special 
conditions" of crude oil to Cuba, as well as stating Mexican 
support to end the U.S. blockade against that country. 
  At the end of the protest, Carrillo asserted that in a 
month, 
the solidarity group Let's Go for Cuba will send a third boat 
with hydrocarbons, medicine, and other kinds of aid to Cuba.

  [Text] Havana, 30 May (EFE) -- This afternoon, European 
Union [EU] ambassadors to Cuba met to analyze the conflict 
triggered by 114 Cubans who took over the Belgian Embassy on 28 
May and who are requesting political asylum. 
  None of the diplomats wanted to make the slightest comment 
at 
the end of the meeting, which lasted over two hours and took 
place at the residence of Greek Ambassador Marinos Raftopoulos, 
who represents the country that heads the EU. 
  Meanwhile, this afternoon, there seemed to be no new 
developments at the Belgian ambassador's residence. The police, 
which are visibly increasing the number of agents as the night 
unfolds, cordoned off the diplomatic residence. 
  Some of those who took over the house could be seen from the 
street at the windows of a house adjacent to the ambassador's 
residence. Some very young children could also be seen at play 
in the garden. 
  Official sources emphasized that the negotiations between 
the 
two governments continue and that the Cuban Government has 
guaranteed that these people will not be punished when they 
leave the embassy. They will be able to start the legal 
procedures to leave the country.

  [Text] Havana, 30 May (EFE) -- The Cuban and Belgium 
Governments fully concur that the 114 persons who stormed the 
Belgian ambassador's residence in Havana on Saturday must leave 
peacefully, officials sources at the Cuban Foreign Ministry 
[Minrex] told EFE. 
  "That is the fundamental agreement. They must leave 
peacefully because they did not enter in a legal manner," a top 
official who declined to be identified stated. The source 
indicated that these persons "will not be punished for breaking 
into the embassy," but noted that the Belgian authorities have 
not provided Cuba with the list of persons who are there and 
that "therefore we do not know who they are and whether there 
are fugitives or delinquents among them." 
  This official indicated that today, the Minrex will reply 
"in 
writing" to the written request for guarantees and other matters 
submitted by the Belgium side but did not want to venture an 
opinion on when the incident would end. 
  "What we cannot allow," he said, "is the transgression of 
the 
law or the transgression of the extraterritoriality of an 
embassy to leave the country, because that is not good for us or 
anyone." 
  Regarding the police deployment around the ambassador's 
residence -- more discrete during the day but highly noticeable 
at night -- he said the Belgian authorities requested it to 
prevent future entries. "That is logical, and, at any rate, we 
would have provided it," he noted. 
  Asked about the food supply for the occupants, including 24 
children, he said that was the Belgian ambassador's problem. "We 
told him," he said, "the Cubalse state enterprise that supplies 
the diplomatic corps and foreigners was in a position to provide 
the necessary food." 
  In fact, it is still a mystery how this large a number of 
people have been fed since Saturday as the police and neighbors 
have said that no movement in or out of the embassy has been 
detected, except by the ambassador and one of the 114 occupants 
who left last night. Official sources said he was a young man 
and that he left the embassy voluntarily but did not disclose 
his name. 
  This morning, when approached by a couple of newsmen while 
leaving his residence, Belgian Ambassador Paul Veirmeirsch said 
all had slept well and did not want to comment on how they were 
fed. 
  This is the most serious incident that has taken place in a 
diplomatic mission since the 1980 events at the Peruvian Embassy 
when over 10,000 Cubans invaded it after the Havana government 
decided to withdraw the guards from the embassy. Previously, 
Peru had granted political asylum to more than 10 citizens who 
had forced their way into the embassy in an incident in which 
one policeman was killed. 
  This time, the group that apparently had gathered in a park 
in front of the mission took advantage of someone opening the 
door to storm the grounds. Police sources told EFE that there 
were five guards on duty but that they were overwhelmed by the 
crowd. Meanwhile, the rest of the embassies remain with their 
usual guard, which varies from two to five agents according to 
the size of the building.

  [Text] (DYN) -- The President of the Radical Party bloc of 
deputies Raul Galvan yesterday [26 May] lashed out at U.S. 
Ambassador James Cheek "for his statements and pressure to get 
the pharmaceutical patents bill dealt with." 
  Galvan joins a queue of disgruntled legislators who in 
recent 
days have aired similar opinions. 
  The Cilfa [Argentine Industrial Center of Pharmaceutical 
Laboratories] national pharmaceutical chamber also joined in the 
fray over the transition period allowed under the GATT Treaty 
and accused Cheek of "avoiding the extensive debate required" 
for this controversial issue. 
  "It is obvious that Ambassador Cheek has decided to have a 
say in domestic policy decisions, encouraged no doubt by the 
government's complacent attitude to previous incursions of this 
nature," Galvan said. 
  Meanwhile the Senator Jose Genoud who presides over the 
Industry Commission in the Upper House, which is currently 
debating the bill, also had something to say on Cheek's 
attitude, commenting that "the U.S. is now scaremongering." 
  Deputy Alberto Natale (DP [expansion unknown]) even went as 
far as tabling a motion to get Cheek declared persona non grata. 
  Cilfa Executive Director Pablo Challu also said that he was 
"surprised that the press release issued by the U.S. embassy has 
discovered a new classification system whereby Argentina is now 
intermediately developed," a classification which would deny 
Argentina the ten-year transition period stipulated in the GATT 
Treaty.' 
  "This classification is nonexistent for GATT which 
classifies 
countries as underdeveloped, developing and developed, while the 
ten-year transition period is applicable to the first two 
categories, Argentina clearly belonging to the second one," 
Challu said. 
  He also criticized the statement in the press release which 
said that Argentina was not entitled to the ten-year transition 
period because it already had a patent system for manufacturing 
processes. 
  Challu said it was not true as the ten-year proviso is 
applicable to those countries that don't have a product 
patenting system and therefore Argentina is fully covered by the 
GATT Treaty.

  [Text] Santiago, 29 May (EFE) -- The Chilean Social 
Democratic Party's general council today approved the party 
merge with the Radical Party to form what will be called the 
Social Democratic Radical Party [Partido Radical Social 
Democrata--PRSD]. 
  The Radicals yesterday ratified a declaration to this same 
effect. 
  The next step is the official registration of this new party 
with the Electoral Service. The statutes were drafted by a mixed 
commission. 
  The decision to merge the two parties was made due to the 
fact that they are both centrist parties and that the two member 
parties of the governing Coalition of Parties for Democracy 
obtained very few votes during the December 1993 presidential 
elections. 
  It was announced that Radical Senator Anselmo Sule will be 
president of the PRSD and Ernesto Velasco, also a Radical, 
secretary general, while Social Democrats will occupy the vice 
presidencies. 
  Senator Sule today said that the merging of the two parties 
is "a historical event" and will mark "a new phase" of the 
social democratic currents.

  [Text] Quito, 27 May (EFE) -- Human rights organizations in 
Quito today reported that Celso Garbarz, an Italian citizen and 
a member of the Amnesty International (AI) executive committee, 
was attacked by unidentified individuals who left him 
unconscious on a street in a tourist sector of Quito. "Robbery 
was not the motive for the crime because none of his personal 
possessions were taken. He was attacked by three men," Elsie 
Monge, president of the Ecumenical Human Rights Committee 
(CEDHU), told EFE. 
  Garbarz attended the annual meeting of the Ecuadoran chapter 
of the AI in Cuenca last week. He was visiting Quito at the time 
of the attack. Last night Garbarz flew to London where the AI 
headquarters are located. 
  Elsie Monge said that "while in Cuenca and Quito, the AI 
official addressed the issues of detained and missing people, 
difficulties in recognizing the status of refugees, and 
systematic torture in Ecuador." 
  According to statements made by Garbarz, on Sunday he was 
attacked by three well-dressed and armed men who stepped out of 
a vehicle "and began hitting and insulting me without any 
explanation, inflicting multiple wounds and contusions, and 
leaving me lying unconscious on the street." 
  A communique issued by some 20 Ecuadoran human rights and 
church organizations stresses that "this attack is an attempt to 
stop the work being done to denounce the violations being 
committed in Ecuador and to frighten human rights organizations 
because of these organization's actions in the defense of the 
victims of institutional violence."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 26 May (EFE) -- Paraguayan President 
Juan Carlos Wasmosy has said: "I will do my utmost not to 
dissolve Congress." A similar statement was once made by 
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori. 
  Wasmosy made this remark during an exclusive interview with 
the Buenos Aires newspaper AMBITO FINANCIERO. Wasmosy said the 
Congressional Committee on Illegal Activities "puts its foot in 
its mouth so often it has totally lost credibility." 
  The Paraguayan president noted that Fujimori "strengthened 
democracy" in Peru and expressed hopes that "the Paraguayan 
people will mature." 
  Wasmosy said: "Part of the labor movement believes in 
violence and makes demands they know cannot be granted." 
  Wasmosy added that the appearance of a guerrilla movement in 
Mexico and the people's rebellions in Paraguay and Argentina 
"are part of the same plan." 
  He said former Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguinetti 
handled the democratic transition in Uruguay "better" than Raul 
Alfonsin did in Argentina. 
  Juan Carlos Wasmosy said the peasant rebellion is part of an 
ultra-leftist campaign and that the Paraguayan military "have 
adapted to democracy even though no one wants to admit it." 
  "We reduced the number of generals from 62 to 38. Congress 
stripped them even of their food coupons and reduced everything 
they had," Wasmosy said referring to his policy to reorganize 
the Armed Forces "without losing the chain of command or 
discipline." 
  The Paraguayan president said labor leaders "know" the 
government "cannot give them a 40 percent salary increase 
because it would mean 40 percent inflation." 
  Wasmosy ratified the Paraguayan commitment to the Common 
Market of the South (Mercosur) which his country is implementing 
with Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay. 
  "There is no path other than integration, unless someone 
shows me something better," the president stressed, adding that 
he rejected labor leaders' requests to withdraw from Mercosur. 
  He added: "This does not mean I will jump into an empty 
swimming pool and kill my country with me." 
  Wasmosy said Paraguay supports the coordination of Mercosur 
member countries' economic policies. 
  "We must find a way to understand the problems facing 
Brazilians without ruining Argentine industrialists," Wasmosy 
added. 
  The president said that during the Alfonsin administration 
(1983-1989) "there was a reaction against the Argentine Army" 
following the repression of guerrillas which resulted in some 
9,000 deaths, according to official figures. 
  "If the military did not do what they did, Alfonsin could 
not 
have done what he did, and President (Carlos) Menem could not 
have consolidated the Argentine economy," Wasmosy stressed.

  [Text] Lima, 26 May (EFE) -- The Peruvian Government has 
expressed "its surprise and concern" to the OAS over the 
publication of a secret Inter-American Human Rights Commission 
(IAHRC) report on former President Alan Garcia's case. 
  Reports from Washington state that in the report the IAHRC 
reportedly rules against the Peruvian Government in the case 
Alan Garcia raised against the Alberto Fujimori administration 
for "illegal harassment and trial." 
  In an official communique issued today in Lima, the Peruvian 
Foreign Ministry states that both Peru and the IAHRC "are barred 
from divulging or disclosing the IAHRC's preliminary report in 
compliance with pertinent regulations." 
  The communique adds that the Peruvian Government deplores 
the 
disclosure of this report because "it undermines the 
confidentiality" which, according to the Human Rights Convention 
of the Americas, must prevail in the preliminary stage. 
  The Foreign Ministry also expresses "its surprise and 
concern" over the incident, which it believes may affect "a just 
analysis of pending issues to be assessed by the IAHRC." 
  The Foreign Ministry communique asserts that the IAHRC has 
issued a preliminary report and that this organization "does not 
issue rulings or pass sentences at this or at any other level." 
  It adds that what was disclosed concerning the case 
involving 
the former Peruvian president "does not interfere in the 
investigations or in the judicial proceedings" to which Alan 
Garcia must respond in Peru. 
  Garcia has several trials pending in Peru for the alleged 
illegal possession of guns and misappropriation of funds while 
in public office. 
  Reports from Washington state that the IAHRC has established 
that the "the Peruvian Government is responsible for violating 
the right to personal safety and freedom of Alan Garcia Perez 
and his wife, and the right to personal protection conferred 
upon his children by the Human Rights Convention of the 
Americas." 
  Garcia also sued the Peruvian Government before the IAHRC 
for 
a raid on his private residence that the military conducted on 5 
April 1992. On this date, President Alberto Fujimori perpetrated 
a coup d'etat as a result of which he closed Congress, 
dismantled the judiciary, and assumed complete power with the 
support of the military.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota 29 May (AFP) -- According to exit 
polls conducted by the Caracol Radio Network with 57,800 voters 
after they had cast their votes, liberal candidate Ernesto 
Samper will win this Sunday's election. Samper will receive 
47.3 percent and his opponent, conservative Andres Pastrana, 
44.3 percent of the vote. 
  Those polled were also asked about their favorite candidate 
for an eventual run-off election, which would be held on 19 
June. While Samper is also seen to lead this election with 50.4 
percent of the intended votes, 47.5 percent favor Pastrana and 
2.1 percent are undecided. 
  Caracol was unable to report the results of this poll 
because 
of the Colombian Government's restrictions on releasing 
election-related information.

  [Text] On 25 May, the Group of 100 and the Environmental 
Research Agency urged the Mexican delegation, which is 
participating in the 46th Annual Conference of the International 
Whaling Commission (IWC), to avoid making changes in a French 
proposal to establish a sanctuary for this animal in Antarctica. 
  Mr. Homero Arigis, president of the Group of 100, and 
Catherine Helmsly, who heads the whale program of the 
Environmental Research Agency, said the original plan was to 
demarcate the sanctuary at 40 degrees latitude south across the 
Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans. The Mexican proposal, 
however, is to demarcate it somewhere between 50 and 62 degrees 
latitude south, which would entail the reduction of thousands of 
kilometers where the capture of whales would be banned. 
  Mr. Homero Arigis said: Mexico has joined Chile, 
Switzerland, 
Sweden, and Monaco in supporting this proposal, and, in doing 
so, Mexico is obstructing the original French proposal without 
giving it an chance. This move was called divisive and 
contradictory to the position publicly announced last week by 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
  The two organizations pointed out that the Mexican 
delegation 
must explain the reason for its change in position on the 
protection of whales, adding that its reply should be reflected 
in the way it votes on the sanctuary issue. 
  Mr. Homero Arigis said: In terms of protecting the sea cow, 
which is the most threatened and most common marine cetacean in 
the upper Gulf of California, this year the IWC Scientific 
Commission has estimated its total population at 316. An IWC 
delegation has proposed a resolution to protect sea cows at this 
meeting. The Mexican delegation, however, replied that Mexico 
prefers the noninclusion of this resolution on the IWC meeting's 
agenda. 
  The Group of 100 and the Environmental Research Agency ruled 
out that Mexico will sell its vote, but both groups noted Japan 
is capturing whales in Mexican seas. They recognized Japanese 
sovereignty, but asked this Asian nation to also enforce 
international sovereignty and to modify its customs, as Mexico 
did when it stopped consuming sea turtle eggs.

  [Text] The whale sanctuary in the Antarctic has been 
approved. Most of the countries participating in the 46th annual 
meeting of the International Whaling Commission [IWC] said yes 
to the proposal to establish an area of protection against 
commercial whaling. Thirty countries participated in the final 
vote. Of these, 23 countries, including Mexico, were in favor. 
One country, Japan, voted against the proposal. There were six 
abstentions. Norway decided not to participate in the vote. 
  The sanctuary that was accepted corresponds to the proposal 
presented on Thursday morning by Mexico, France, and Chile and 
was supported by the rest of the nations. It will be located at 
latitude 40 degrees south, but the 200 nautical miles of Chile 
and Argentina will be respected.

<F P=106> [Report by Jorge Benitez] </F>
  [Text] Asuncion, 31 May (EFE) -- According to official 
sources contacted by EFE, the ambitious integration project 
pursued by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay will only 
partially achieve the goals initially established for 1995, and 
the formation of a common market will most likely have to wait 
until the year 2001 or 2005. 
  In this regard the final negotiations will begin on 6 June 
in 
Asuncion, the same city where the four countries signed the 
Common Market of the South (Mercosur) treaty in March 1991. 
  The bilateral agreement establishes that there must be a 
free 
zone for the transit of goods, services, and productive elements 
as of 1 January 1995. This involves the removal of customs 
duties and bureaucratic restrictions. The countries are also 
required to implement a Common External Tariff (AEC) and a 
similar trade policy for other nations as of 1 January 1995. 
  In addition, the macroeconomics policies must be coordinated 
and the respective legislations in fiscal, monetary, 
transportation, foreign trade, agriculture, industry, and 
communications areas, among others, must be harmonized. 
  Antonio Felix Lopez, the Paraguayan vice minister for 
international economic relations, told EFE that according to the 
progress achieved in the AEC negotiations and the decisions made 
during the past three years, "now we are aware of the fact that 
Mercosur will actually be established between the years 2001 and 
2005." 
  Lopez believes the implementation of the free trade zone is 
guaranteed "because nothing leads to the belief that the tariff 
removal program will be postponed." The program's penultimate 
tariff removal, before establishing a zero level for customs 
duties on regional products levied by the four partners, by 31 
December at the latest, will be established on 30 June. 
  Nevertheless, the source pointed out the existence of doubts 
on the formation of a "customs union" involving the AEC 
implementation, "which might occur by 1 January 1995, even 
though it is more likely to happen a little later." 
  The source added that macroeconomic coordination represents 
another key factor, "even for the implementation of the free 
trade zone, and even though it includes the AEC, there are other 
additional elements that must still be harmonized." 
  Any possible delays in Mercosur's final goals might be 
cleared on 10 July during a joint meeting between the Common 
Market Council [Consejo del Mercado Comun] (CMC) and the 
presidents of the member states. 
  On 6 June in Asuncion, various Common Market Group [Grupo 
Mercado Comun] (GMC) committees will meet to discuss the 
mechanisms to draw up the AEC exemption lists, and their 
decisions will be submitted to the economy vice ministers, who 
will meet on 17 June in Montevideo. The GMC is the Mercosur's 
executive body. 
  Later, the vice ministers will meet twice again -- probably 
on 28 June and 7 July -- before delivering their recommendations 
to the GMC, whose members will visit the Uruguayan capital on 8 
and 9 July. 
  This series of negotiations meets the requirement of 
reaching 
an agreement as soon as possible on each partner's "sensitive" 
products that will be protected by high tariffs -- ranging 
between 21 and 35 percent -- which will initially be applicable 
until the year 2001. 
  A reduction program must also be established so that these 
tariffs will gradually be reduced until reaching an ideal level 
agreed upon by the four partners. 
  Lopez explained that conversely, the same will happen with 
those products imported from outside the Mercosur zone with paid 
duties that are below those to be established in the decisions 
on the future customs union "because no one wants an abrupt 
transformation, but rather a gradual and convergent 
transformation." 
  Mercosur represents a market of more than 190 million 
consumers in the four member states, whose territories 
altogether represent about 70 percent of South America.

  [Text] Cuba will work for unity and strengthening the 
international prestige of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM], Cuban 
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said in Cairo. He will 
participate in the meeting of NAM foreign ministers beginning on 
Tuesday. 
  Shortly after arriving at the Egyptian capital, Robaina said 
that not only will positions be established at the meeting, but 
decisions must be made on NAM actions with regard to the growing 
imbalance in international relations, a unipolar world, and the 
concentration of economic power in northern countries.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] On 31 May, Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina stated the main goal of the Nonaligned Movement 
[NAM] is to promote the economic and social development of the 
Third World. During his address to the 11th ministerial summit 
of the NAM, Robaina stressed that an opulent North and an 
impoverished South is the world's reality today. He added that 
if we sit on our hands, we are condemned to disappear, which 
would mean the disappearance of two thirds of mankind. Robaina 
affirmed that Cuba believes that the best guarantee for a 
permanent and lasting peace is the elimination of hunger. Only 
then will human rights bloom for all people rather than for a 
minuscule portion of mankind. 
  Robaina affirmed that despite the over 30-year-old blockade 
against Cuba, the Cuban people will overcome this difficult 
junction, thanks, above all, to the solidarity of the NAM. 
  Robaina continues to fulfill a busy schedule that includes 
meeting with representatives of Libya, the PRC, Cyprus, Panama, 
Zambia, Colombia, Italy, and Ecuador.

  [Text] South Africa's imminent incorporation into the 
Nonaligned Movement [NAM] and Cuba's election to one of the vice 
presidencies of the summit were two of the main results of the 
meeting for experts which concluded on 30 May, prior to the 
ministerial meeting. Diplomatic sources report that the 
meeting's agenda was approved and that its essential points 
include an analysis of the international political and economic 
situation and of the NAM's role for the immediate future. 
Egyptian President Husni Mubarak will officially open the 11th 
NAM summit on 31 May. The summit will conclude on 3 June. 
  Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina had a very busy 
agenda 
while the summit was taking place at the Cairo Conference 
Center, meeting several officials including the Arab League 
secretary general and the Zimbabwean, Vietnamese, Iraqi, and 
Burmese foreign ministers on the need to strengthen the NAM and 
the principles that gave birth to the Movement. The common 
denominator at these meetings was to give continuity to the 
positive results the NAM has experienced under Indonesia's 
presidency since the Jakarta summit. 
  Just minutes ago, Robaina met Honduran Foreign Minister 
(Ernesto Rojas), who conveyed a friendly greeting from President 
Reina. (Rojas) announced during the meeting his forthcoming 
visit to Havana in response to Robaina's invitation.

  [Text] Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly 
of the People's Government [ANPP], asserted at the conclusion of 
his visit to the UK that he had perceived an atmosphere of 
friendship towards Cuba in his contact with government 
authorities, parliamentarians, and businessmen. Alarcon headed 
an ANPP delegation integrated by Lidia Tablada, who presides 
over the Friendship with Great Britain group of the ANPP, and 
Osvaldo Martinez, president of the Economic Affairs Commission 
of the ANPP. 
  Upon his return to Cuba, Alarcon commented on the interest 
that the British Parliament expressed towards Cuba. Alarcon's 
visit to Great Britain included meetings with the top leaders of 
the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Alarcon informed 
this newscast that on 27 May, the agenda of the British 
Parliament included British-Cuban relations. 
  [Begin Alarcon recording] There was a very interesting 
debate 
in the parliament regarding relations with Cuba. A government 
minister took part in this debate and very clearly reaffirmed 
Great Britain's policy of continuing and developing economic and 
commercial relations with Cuba. [end recording] 
  Alarcon asserted that he had witnessed, in parliament, Great 
Britain's position with regard to the U.S. blockade against Cuba. 
  [Begin Alarcon recording] In the parliamentary debate that I 
mentioned, MP Arnold, who is a leader of the Conservative Party 
and the one who brought up the issue, and the minister of 
commerce, who replied on behalf of the government, both clearly 
expressed Britain's disagreement with the blockade policy. A 
commitment to noncompliance with the blockade was clear, as was 
the intent to strengthen ties with Cuba. [end recording] 
  Alarcon stated the British minister of commerce will visit 
Cuba in September. 
  The same flight that brought the Cuban delegation back home 
carried Marcelino dos Santos, president of the National Assembly 
of Mozambique, who asserted that he came to learn, profoundly 
and scientifically, about the revolutionary process in Cuba.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Fernando Davalos: "Two Summits"] </F>
  [Text] Today's newspaper refers to Cuba's intention to 
support -- and I quote -- integration at the fourth 
Ibero-American summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, in two 
weeks -- unquote. 
  First, I want to remind our listeners that this will be the 
fourth time that chiefs of state and government from Latin 
America, Spain, and Portugal have met. They will meet without 
having been called upon by the United States and without the 
presence of its representatives to discuss matters of interest 
to our countries. 
  Meetings like these used to be organized by the U.S. 
Administration. It is still clear in my memory the image of one 
of the latest calls for a meeting of Latin American presidents 
or chiefs of state held, I believe, in Panama before the 
revolution. 
  I remember Fulgencio Batista, with his greasy long hair and 
brand new jean suit, following the traditional fashion among 
leaders of the political chicanery. Batista, a legion of 
dictators, and grandchildren of the Americans themselves were 
present. 
  Today's summits are quite different from yesterday's 
summits. 
Meeting with Spain and Portugal without Americans present is 
somewhat of a new thing. Three Ibero-American summits were held 
in this manner, namely in Brazil, Spain, and Mexico. The fourth 
will be held in Colombia. 
  Presidents of different political tendencies have attended 
these summits, but there has always been mutual respect and 
consensus on matters which are vital for our peoples. Fidel's 
words and presence have always been present at those summits. 
  The latest summit approved a virtual sanction on the U.S. 
blockade against Cuba, surely an exceptional achievement. It 
seems these four summits have been too much for this great 
northern country, which has decided to sponsor a similar summit. 
I mean similar but not equal. I mean similar because it is 
also a summit of chiefs of government, and I say that it will 
not be equal because Cuba will not be present. 
  The U.S. summit will be held in Miami in December, while the 
summit that will be held by the Ibero-American nations will 
discuss, to a great extent, integration. As I said, Cuba will 
try to promote this integration because this unity is vital in 
our current world. 
  I want to remind everyone that integration means more unity, 
especially in the economic field. We will produce for the 
continent using raw material from the continent, and we will 
trade among ourselves. Latin America, Spain, and Portugal 
comprise such a large territory where there are all types of 
climates, all productions, and all resources. What one country 
lacks can be found in another, or vice versa. So, there should 
be no artificial borders capable of hampering this common flow. 
  I said there should not be, but there are artificial 
borders, 
namely those imposed by the interests of the Americans which are 
owners of half of the continent and who are against these 
integrationist ties because they are not good for them. This is 
why they have not been invited for the previous Ibero-American 
summits because our language is very different. And now they 
are making up their little meeting in Miami, as if it were a 
consolation tournament, out of spite because they were not 
invited to the previous summits. 
  All countries of the continent will be represented in Miami, 
but not Cuba, as the strange maps of the Caribbean which are 
currently made by the transnational companies, maps where Cuba 
or our archipelago are not present. But one thing is true: 
Although we are not on their little maps, Cuba and the Cubans do 
exist, live, work, and fight. We might be blockaded, but we 
have our own voice, out of tune, of course, with the U.S. 
appetites. Perhaps for this reason, we are not invited to that 
little party in Miami because they do not want to hear our voice 
live.

  [Text] On 31 May, Rosa Elena Simeon, minister of Science,

scientific conference preceding the Ibero-American Summit in 
Cartagena de Indias. The scientific conference is on sustainable 
financing for research and technological development of 
Ibero-America. 
  [Begin recording] [Simeon] In this scientific conference, 
other Latin American nations have asked us to report on the 
Cuban experience in science and technology development, which is 
a reality today. Our Latin American colleagues have asked us to 
report on how Cuba attained this scientific development in such 
a short period. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Are all the science and technology 
ministers of Ibero-America going to participate in this 
conference? 
  [Simeon] Yes, although not every Latin American country has 
such ministries per se, but the presidents of the Science and 
Technology Councils of the Ibero-American countries will be in 
attendance. 
  [Reporter] Will any document be signed at the closing? 
  [Simeon] The conference usually closes with a list of 
science 
and technology recommendations, which is presented at the 
heads-of-state summit by the conference president. [end

  [Text] Madrid, 31 May (AFP) -- In an interview published in 
the June edition of Spain's ELLE magazine, Cuban President Fidel 
Castro talks about his life, his struggles, the current problems 
his country is going through, U.S. President Bill Clinton, 
machismo, and harassment against gays in Cuba. 
  In an interview entitled "The Last Revolutionary," Castro 
emphasizes that he has had a "fascinating" life and denies that 
he wants to retire. "It is not my fault that I have not died 
yet, or that the CIA (U.S. intelligence service) has not been 
able to kill me. I am a revolutionary, and revolutionaries do 
not retire, just as writers do not retire," Castro says. He 
adds, however, "no one is indispensable, and I am in need of 
rest." 
  The Cuban leader denies he is concerned about the place he 
will be assigned by history. "Personally, I am not concerned 
about myself. All of the world's glory can fit into a single 
kernel of corn," he points out. Castro adds that it is more 
important to worry "about what happens in terms of ideas than 
about what happens to individuals." 
  After 35 years in power, Castro indicated to ELLE that he 
has 
"the same spirit" he had 48 years ago, when at age 19 he began 
his struggle. "I believe that if I started my life over again, 
I would do everything exactly the same," he insists. 
  With respect to what will become of Cuba after his death, 
Castro replies, "The CIA should be asked that question." 
Nevertheless, he adds: "Honestly, I do not believe anything 
will happen. The government will adapt to the situation. We 
have all of the necessary political and legal instruments set up 
for it to continue the way it is going." 
  When asked about his opinion of Clinton, Castro says his 
opinion on the U.S. President is "positive, but that if he says 
something good about him, some officials in the administration 
will complain because he has enemies who whine that he is too 
soft on Castro. If I say something bad, then the situation will 
be worse. So I better not say anything." 
  Castro says he would be delighted to see Ted Turner, the 
head 
of CNN network, become president of the United States. Turner, 
according to his biographer, considers Fidel one of the two 
great influences of his life. "Ted enjoys life and beauty. I 
would relish seeing him become president of the United States, 
although I should not say this because then he will never get 
elected." 
  When asked by the reporter -- who wrote that Cubans are 
"puritans" and that "the rule is that no one asks Castro about 
his private life" -- Castro acknowledges that he has "less than 
a dozen children." He says there not enough to be considered a 
"tribe." 
  With regard to homosexuals, Castro stresses, "Revolutionary 
homophobia is a simple extension of Latin American machismo." 
Nevertheless, he adds that "he has never shared this feeling." 
  According to the reporter, the Cuban leader "turned pale" 
when asked if his brother was behind the work camps for 
homosexuals. It is said that Raul Castro was impressed with how 
Bulgaria had handled the undesirables (homosexuals) issue. 
"This is false," Castro says, roused to indignation. 
  The magazine also reminisces on the Cuban president's "great 
admiration for feminine adroitness and fortitude." During his 
years in the Sierra Madre, the revolution's crack troops were 
comprised women only because they "are better soldiers" than 
men, Castro points out. 
  The interview concludes with Castro's rowdy laughter to a 
joke by the ELLE reporter. "What are the Cuban Revolution's 
accomplishments? [no closing quotation marks as received] 
Education, health, and sports. And the revolution's failings? 
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Anyway, Castro replies that "to 
eat too much is bad for one's health."

Cardin, the acclaimed French designer, entrepreneur, and artist, 
and two of his associates at the Palace of the Revolution. 
Cardin told Fidel that he was fulfilling a longtime dream by 
visiting our country for the first time and by meeting him 
personally. Cardin also conveyed to the head of the revolution 
his enormous appreciation for all he had been able to see since 
his arrival in Havana, the capital's architecturally beautiful 
historical areas, the friendliness of the Cuban people, and 
Cuba's excellent conditions for developing international 
tourism. Fidel thanked Cardin for his visit and held a cordial 
and extensive exchange of ideas on issues related to the 
multifaceted activities of the French entrepreneur.

  [Text] Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has 
asked the Mexican National Congress for permission to pay an 
official visit to Cuba next month. Salinas will travel to 
Havana and then to Cartagenas de Indias to attend the fourth 
Ibero-American summit. 
  Salinas' request to the Mexican parliament notes that Mexico 
and Cuba maintain respectful diplomatic relations and highlights 
that Cuba is part of Mexico's Caribbean border. Furthermore, 
throughout history and in the context of respectful bilateral 
relations and profound ties of appreciation between the two 
peoples, Cuban-Mexican ties have made room for international 
cooperation, which can be interpreted today as an agenda that 
merits contacts. The presidential request concludes by pointing 
out that the Mexican head of state's presence in Cuba will help 
boost bilateral relations, the evaluation of the bilateral 
agenda, and the exploration of new ways to diversify and 
strengthen those relations.

  [Text] Havana, 26 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the state 
enterprise Cuba Petroleo (Cupet) confirmed it could receive 
Mexican crude oil to be refined at the almost-halted Cienfuegos 
Refinery to supply the domestic market. 
  Juan Fleites, director of Cupet, which is negotiating a 
joint 
venture for the plant with its Mexican counterpart, Mex-Petrol, 
told NOTIMEX the following: "Should we reach an agreement on the 
refinery, we could start receiving Mexican crude oil." 
  Since March, Cupet and Mex-Petrol have been studying 
alternatives to extending and modernizing the Cienfuegos 
refinery, the country's largest refinery, located on the 
south-central coast. 
  Yesterday, Carlos Ferrer Argote, Mexican Foreign Relations 
Secretariat Caribbean affairs director, said the negotiations 
could include the supply of crude oil. He added: "Both parties 
are working to yield results in the best of interests. We are 
trying to conclude as soon as possible, but it is difficult to 
conduct studies." 
  The lack of oil and the shortage of spare parts for its 
Soviet-made infrastructure are keeping the refinery, which can 
refine 3 million tons annually, almost halted. 
  Cuba is also negotiating with Colombia the supply of oil to 
offset the fuel deficit that emerged from the drop of purchases 
from the defunct Soviet Union. The purchases dropped from 13 
million tons to less than half that amount between 1991 and 
1992. According to the agreement, Cupet and Mex-Petrol will 
invest $200 million to start production at the extended and 
modernized plant, to supply the domestic market, and to export 
surpluses. 
  Ferrer, who was in Merida, Yucatan State, attending the 19th 
Caribbean Studies Association Congress, pointed out exports 
could be sold to countries in the region. He also said the 
Cuban-Mexican study is analyzing "an ample spectrum of crude 
oils, from the lightest to the heaviest, to match the quality of 
supply to the prices of hydrocarbons and their byproducts." 
  Cupet's director confirmed the project has already 
determined 
its investment strategy: Each party will invest $100 million, 
half the total investment. The Mexican contribution will be as 
follows: 50 percent in resources and 50 percent in joint venture 
assets, which will be charged to the Cuban debt. The Cuban and 
Mexican central banks have an agreement that, among other 
issues, allows the settling of the $310 million Cuban debt 
through "swap" [previous word in English] operations.

  [Text] On 31 May, the Ministry of Finance and Prices made 
the following announcement: Bearing in mind that there are 
gasoline ration coupons in the hands of private consumers that 
were not included in the sale cycle and price increase 
established by the 20 May accord of the Executive Committee of 
the Council of Ministers, it has been decided that during June, 
those coupons will retain the same price and sale cycle as 
before the aforementioned accord. 
  We would also like to remind our listeners that as of 1 
June, 
new prices for cigarettes, cigars, rum, and beer will become 
effective as part of the measures aimed at correcting the 
national financial imbalance. As the year progresses, other 
products and services such as electricity, transportation, 
water, sewage, and postal services will experience price 
increases.

  [Text] The national secretariat of the Cuban Workers 
Federation [CTC] has agreed to conduct an in-depth analysis of 
the causes of the current nationwide shortage of work shoes, and 
discussed the feasibility of investing the hard currency used by 
enterprises to buy shoes abroad in national factories. 
  During the meeting, chaired by CTC Secretary General Pedro 
Ross Leal, it was reported that operations at the largest work 
shoe factory, located in Granma, are being affected by the lack 
of electricity, although the necessary raw materials are 
available. The CTC national secretariat acknowledged the work 
done by Granma Province, and pointed out that the metallurgy 
sector has grown 16 percent in the first quarter of 1994 and has 
reduced losses by 16 million pesos.

  [Text] Politburo member Jose Ramon Balaguer stated in Pinar 
del Rio Province that each day, we need more ideological 
steadfastness as we are subjected to the influence of foreign 
capital and the barrage of information that reaches us either 
openly or covertly. Balaguer added that one of the principal 
missions of Cuban media is to safeguard Communist Party of Cuba 
policies and to prevent their distortion.

<F P=106> [Report by Santiago de Cuba correspondent Margarita Pecora] </F>
  [Text] I can confirm with the conviction provided by facts 
and without any triumphalism that economic recovery is in the 
air in Santiago de Cuba. Approximately 500 leaders of this 
territory's enterprises and organizations have been holding a 
meeting on economic efficiency since this morning, chaired by 
Esteban Lazo Hernandez, Politburo member and Cuban Communist 
Party first secretary in the province. 
  Economic recovery is well under way. The shoe industry can 
reaffirm its pledge to produce 1.8 million pairs of shoes this 
year, while the metalworking enterprise expects to double its 
production in the second half of the year and to provide new 
lines of production -- such as bicycle spokes and nails -- as 
well as to reap good dividends from the sale of screws. 
  We can add to this network of important industrial centers 
food production, which will grow considerably compared to the 
previous year in terms of flour and dairy products, the 
production of a line of soy yogurts, and the production of 
Cerelac supplement for the elderly. 
  The production of Santiago de Cuba's liquor and beverage 
enterprise is also encouraging, since it solved acute problems 
in the boilers, refrigerators, and filters and now intends to 
increase beer production by approximately two million boxes, as 
well as 3.7 million liters of rum, in addition to providing 55 
tons of yeast for bread production in Santiago de Cuba and 
Guantanamo Provinces. 
  To this we can add the mango crop, which will triple last 
year's with a harvest estimated at 500,000 quintals. Lazo also 
acknowledged that the production of tubers and vegetables in 
Santiago de Cuba, although production plans are fulfilled every 
year, remains the Achilles' heel of the province. This is why 
he demanded more and better work to extract from the earth 
everything it can yield despite the lack of appropriate 
resources. He added that there can be no enterprise director 
whose mind and soul is not pledged to the battle for economic 
efficiency.

  [Text] Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan, Politburo 
member, has called for the strict implementation of Cuban 
agrarian laws and demands that farmers fulfill their food 
delivery commitments. 
  In Matanzas, Jordan pointed out that it is inadmissible that 
there are farmers who so far this year have not delivered a 
single quintal of agrarian products. Jordan stressed that the 
people's food supply is inviolable and that whoever has arable 
lands and production agreements with the state is obligated to 
fulfill the terms of the agreements. Jordan added that more 
severity will be imposed against farmers who fail to deliver, 
and if necessary, firm application of measures provided for in 
the Agrarian Law will be used. Finally, Jordan announced that 
the government is considering levying a tax on fallow lands.

  [Text] Division General Ulises Rosales del Toro, first vice 
minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, has praised the 
contribution made by the 35th Anniversary of the Triumph of the 
Revolution unit in the tomato harvest in Pinar del Rio. Rosales 
pointed out that the harvest this year was larger than last 
year, but that this is no reason to feel smug because there is 
still room to improve production. 
  Rosales del Toro added that the experience attained by the 
Youth Labor Army and several farms of Los Palacios Rice 
Agroindustrial Complex ought be implemented to achieve higher 
efficiency with students from the military schools. 
  This year, the 35th Anniversary of the Triumph of the 
Revolution unit harvested over 193,000 quintals of tomatoes, as 
well as 50,000 quintals of tubers and vegetables.

  [Text] After some technical difficulties, the Antonio 
Guiteras Power Plant in Matanzas has incorporated its 330 
megawatt unit into the national electric system. Specialists at 
that plant report that the average output exceeds 270 megawatts 
and that the recent repairs did away with other problems that 
obstructed the continuous generation of power. A one-month 
maintenance outage is projected for September, which will allow 
regulating 50 percent of the turbine valves, clean the boiler, 
and repair auxiliary equipment. 
  The Antonio Guiteras Electric Plant is the most efficient of 
its kind in Cuba and has achieved more than 40 percent of its 
electric production goals for 1994.

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program hosted by Osvaldo Rodriguez of </F>
JUVENTUD REBELDE and featuring guest Maribel Acosta from NTV -- 
live] 
  [Text] [Rodriguez] Is Cuba a country of prostitutes? 
[jineteras] Maribel, you are astonished by the question. I can 
see that in your face. I believe many people are asking this 
question today, a question we should try to answer today, 
perhaps talking about the matter, talking about prostitution, 
male prostitution as well.... 
  [Acosta, interrupting] And child prostitution. 
  [Rodriguez] And child prostitution. I believe we must face 
this matter with a great deal of realism. This is a phenomenom 
new to the Revolution, but old to the world. Actually it was an 
old phenomenom in Cuba before the Revolution. 
  Prostitution was a necessity, a necessity in order to 
survive. Later it became a way of being able to live better than 
the rest, in that recent period. Today, I believe the economic 
situation is fostering a revival of this phenomenon, but I still 
believe one should not have to sell one's body in order to solve 
problems in a crisis situation. I do not know what you, yourself 
think about this. 
  [Acosta] I think prostitution is obviously on the increase, 
and I mean all types of prostitution -- whether of women, which 
is is what basically attracts the most attention and, to put it 
one way, is the most developed, but also of children, and of men 
as well. It is something that one did not encounter frequently, 
a few years ago. 
  What is most dangerous, however, is that it is beginning to 
receive a certain amount of social tolerance, at least in the 
city of Havana. I know this because I travel extensively 
throughout the country. Situations like this also exist in other 
parts of Cuba, although I think it is more open, more obvious 
and overwhelming in Havana. 
  This situation is also tolerated by a particular group of 
people in Havana. It is obvious that the economic situation in 
Cuba is difficult, that is clear. But as far as I am concerned 
-- I, who am living more or less the same way everyone else 
lives -- it is not necessary to sell oneself at all. There is a 
very curious phenomenom. For example, [pauses] of course there 
are many ways of looking at things in life, and the very way 
society sometimes looks at things contributes to different 
things. 
  The other day I was walking by the Hotel Presidente on my 
way 
to the Casa de Las Americas, and on the hotel door leading to 
the pool there was a sign reading: children's party -- cake, 
soft drinks, pinatas and sweets during the last two Sundays of 
the month: two dollars per child. That is what the sign said. 
Well, we all know that having dollars is no longer penalized, 
but we also know that pharmacies that were selling medicines in 
dollars were deprived of those medicines for this very same 
reason because these are things with which the people must not 
be burdened. 
  [Rodriguez] We have said -- in the past, in Straight Talk -- 
that there were limits, to dollar income. But we cannot hurt the 
population's feelings; and that sign you just mentioned surely 
hurts and exasperates those who walk by knowing that their 
children would like to be there but cannot because their parents 
do not have the dollars to pay for them. 
  [Acosta] Does the Presidente Hotel need to be profitable at 
the expense of children's parties? I do not think so. I do not 
think it needs to do that, and it should not do it either, not 
only from the ethical point of view but also from the economic 
point of view because by no means should it base its 
profitability on something like this. And besides, you are 
walking with your child, a child who does not understand things 
much because he is still small, and he says: I would like to go 
to the swimming pool on Sunday. And you say: You cannot go there 
because we have to pay in dollars to get there. Imagine! And who 
has dollars? 
  [Rodriguez] Maribel, I perceived indignation in you as you 
gave that concrete example. I do think this is not the only 
example, however. I think we must also talk about the family. A 
few hours ago, I was told an anecdote concerning a neighborhood 
here in Havana -- specifically, the Vedado neighborhood -- where 
a 14-year-old girl engages in prostitution with her family's 
permission. She is only 14 years old. I think that is the child 
prostitution matter you mentioned. She is not a full grown woman 
yet, and does not know what she wants. She has no idea of what 
love really is, nor does she know the significance of selling 
her body. 
  In addition to society as a whole, I think the family is 
also 
responsible, for allowing this to happen. And of course, the 
government can be held partially, although not fully, 
responsible for this because people often want the government to 
solve all police problems through repression. I think this is 
just a matter of education. What do you think? 
  [Acosta] Look, of course the family has a tremendous 
influence in this regard. And this has to do with what I was 
telling you about the social tolerance of this phenomenon. 
Tolerance means that people are looking at the phenomenon more 
leniently, not worrying much about whether a young girl or boy 
becomes a prostitute or not. This, then, becomes a growing 
phenomenon, and of course the family is very much responsible. 
There are people who claim -- and on this I agree with them -- 
that such behavior is normal in a time of crisis. I mean: A 
human being's worst aspects usually emerge in times of crisis. 
This is true. Therefore, we are facing a phenomenon for which 
there is no explanation. It is good to be alert, however, 
because we want to preserve the virtues we have preserved to 
date. 
  And there is something that continues to bother me: Every 
morming I walk around the Habana Libre Hotel, and there are many 
children begging there, including children wearing uniforms, 
asking the tourists for money. The way they ask tourists for 
money, however, is not the way we see children in capitalist 
countries or poor countries ask. 
  In a capitalist country when a child asks a tourist for 
money, the tourists do not dare to do anything because they know 
that if they try anything, they can be beaten or can be simply 
murdered. Our children, accustomed to being loved by society, 
children who are usually protected and often spoiled, do not 
know anything about what happens in other countries. And I have 
seen the way tourists are attacked and beaten up in other places. 
  Such an example gives you an idea of the wicked actions that 
can occur, and I have often thought about this. Do you realize 
the difference here, and do you realize the real need to do 
these things? I mean: Do you see the difference between one 
place and another? 
  The children who are begging for things in certain foreign 
countries, as I have seen them in Latin America, are sad-looking 
children. They are children who are fighting for survival, and 
you can see that in their eyes. But our children beg for money 
to buy candies. 
  [Rodriguez] Maribel, I believe the examples you are giving 
us 
regarding the children seem to be sporadic examples that can 
perhaps be seen around the Habana Libre Hotel, as you said, or 
maybe in other tourist centers in the interior of Cuba; and they 
are being repressed effectively by the Pioneer organizations, 
the Union of Young Communists [UJC], and educational 
organizations, and I think families are also taking action. As 
you said, however, the goals of those children are candies, but 
sometimes they could also be attracted by signs like the one you 
found on the door of a hotel. Parents often also need those 
dollars, which cannot be obtained easily through legal means. 
They need dollars to take their children to such places, and to 
meet certain artificial needs that are often created. 
  [Acosta] Yes. This is something we can discuss further, to 
tie what is happening in our society to the effects of the 
measures adopted recently. Moreover, the discussions held among 
the population, those Parliaments in the Workplace, seek to 
explain these phenomena, which are beginning to undermine 
society's values because work and the salaries of people who 
depend on their work, who depend on their salaries and their 
competency, are valued in society and are what give people their 
true value. 
  The measures adopted recently, or measures outlined as 
policies that will be implemented gradually, will surely create 
the conditions in which people will be admired and respected 
for, and their value will depend on, their personal efforts and 
work, and not on immorality. This phenomenon, then, has to do 
with all these things, and in a way we must try to harness it 
socially; otherwise, social tolerance will emerge and the 
problem will worsen. 
  [Rodriguez] I also think that we must... 
  [Acosta, interrupting] We must also recall that this year, 
the crime committee discussed the idea of including within the 
penal code some criminal actions such as prostitution, 
procuring, etc. It was an idealistic mistake to exclude them, 
that is, I think that things like these must also be repressed. 
  [Rodriguez] Yes. I also think, Maribel, that this type of 
action has reached a peak due mainly to the economic crisis. But 
there are other moral values that must be preserved. In addition 
to solving its economic problems, society must also preserve 
moral values because, as you said, these economic problems are 
related to our moral and social problems. But above all, I think 
we must recover the precept we have learned from our 
forefathers, from our grandparents. They are poor but honest. I 
think we must recover these principles because no crisis... 
  [Acosta, interrupting] These are also the principles of Jose 
Marti. When we read Marti's ideas thoroughly, we realize that 
one of the most common words in his writings is honesty. 
  [Rodriguez] Yes. No crisis can drag us to find dollars 
through any illegal means. It is true that in our society having 
dollars today means having solved some essential problems which 
most Cubans cannot solve. This is a truth no one can deny. But 
obtaining dollars by means of selling one's body is perhaps one 
of the most despicable ways for a human being to obtain a 
profit. And you who are a woman will probably know how to 
explain better to our listeners what does it mean for a woman to 
feel love for another person, to have a feeling, and not to be 
sold like merchandise because I think all those women engaged in 
prostitution are just merchandise. Don't you think? 
  [Acosta] Yes. But I think you are only revealing your 
chauvinist position because I have to explain the situation not 
only because I am a woman, but I am going to answer the question 
anyhow because I guess I have no other alternative. Then, yes. 
Of course, love is essential in all aspects of life to enjoy 
life. This is our ultimate goal in life. As (Galiano) used to 
say: It is much better to make a living and not to buy it ready 
made. Then this is what it is, we have to gradually make our 
life, fighting and loving. And this type of action will 
ultimately generate love. No one can say that the lack of love 
is necessary for living. I believe these social behaviors can 
somehow be controlled or eradicated. I want Cuba to stop this 
problem. This is further proof that Cuba will remain as the Cuba 
we have always wanted and which we have hoped for. 
  [Rodriguez] Thank you very much, Maribel Acosta, from the 
National Television Newscast, for discussing the problem of 
prostitution with us.

    [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 
at 0100 GMT on 31 May carries its "Straight Talk" Program with 
Host Osvaldo Rodriguez, from BOHEMIA magazine, and his guest 
reporter Renato Recio, from TRABAJADORES newspaper. They are 
discussing the increased prices at workers' cafeterias, which 
will go into effect on 1 June. 
  Rodriguez and Recio begin by talking about the excess 
currency on the streets. Rodriguez points out that at the end of 
March, there was 11.636 billion pesos of excess currency 
circulating on the streets. Recio notes that the meals offered 
at the cafeterias are very inexpensive. 
  Rodriguez and Recio change the focus of their discussion to 
the lack of control at work centers. Recio points out: "We all 
know that in Cuba, there is a lack of control over resources in 
many -- too many -- economic enterprises. It would not be 
absurd, it would be logical that among those who work in the 
warehouses, or who handle and work with the foods that are later 
offered at the cafeterias, there could be symptoms of lack of 
control. Of course, whatever is misappropriated can graciously 
be tacked onto the prices, and that is not right. 
  ``Therefore, I believe there should be strict control over 
all resources sent to workers' cafeterias and that efforts 
should be made to reduce costs. Earlier, you mentioned 
self-sufficiency. That is something that could help improve 
variety at the cafeterias without significantly increasing 
prices. Therefore, the work centers should link what they offer 
in their cafeterias with what is produced in the 
self-sufficiency gardens.'' 
  Rodriguez mentions that there are some workers who expect to 
be paid to work on the self-sufficiency farms. Regarding this, 
Rodriguez says: "That comrade who goes to work on the 
self-sufficiency gardens has a salary, and his salary is often 
higher than that of a farmer." He later says: "In Camaguey, they 
are experimenting with methods whereby an industrial center can 
create a cooperative with industrial workers to supply the 
center's cafeteria with food." 
  Recio goes on to say: "I believe all roads should lead 
toward 
efficiency. If a road does not lead toward efficiency, I believe 
it should be closed. That is how I see things." He notes that 
the workers parliaments demonstrated that Cuba must eliminate 
subsidies to work centers and to workers' cafeterias. He says: 
"I believe we all agree -- or most of us agree -- that the 
prices of the food served in the cafeterias should be increased, 
but I insist that the labor unions make sure administrations do 
not take shortcuts. The easiest thing is to solve economic 
problems with prices." He goes on to say: "There are many 
reasons for inefficiency at the workers' cafeterias. That 
inefficiency is not what I should receive. I should receive 
quality and above all, variety." 
  Recio concludes by saying: "I believe we all agree on price 
increases and decreasing or eliminating subsidies to workers' 
cafeterias, but this must be related to a cost analysis, a 
practice that leans toward efficiency and a practice that leans 
toward quality. It is sad to see prices increase while quality 
decreases. Quality and price should be linked. 
  Rodriguez concludes by saying: "I do not believe workers' 
cafeterias are always prepared to analyze this issue of cost. 
That is why I foresee many injustices being committed when this 
measure goes into effect on 1 June. I believe injustices will be 
committed in some places. We, therefore, alert our listeners, 
workers in general, labor union leaders, party leaders, and of 
course, the administrations, to be watchful so these types of 
injustices are not committed."

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments carried on Havana 
radio and television in Spanish between 23 and 29 May: 
  Radio Rebelde at 1155 GMT on 23 May reports that Noel 
Adrian, 
general director of the Cuban-French enterprise Havana Club 
Internacional, has announced in Santiago de Cuba that Havana 
Club rum will be officially launched in France, Belgium, 
England, and other European countries in July. 
  Radio Reloj at 1933 GMT on 23 May reports that the Antonio 
Maceo power plant in Santiago de Cuba is resuming operations 
after being off-line for two days because of weather conditions. 
  Radio Reloj at 1942 GMT on 23 May reports that the Mercado 
S.A. tourism group, which promotes scientific tourism in Cuba, 
brought more than 7,000 tourists to Cuba and grossed $2 million 
during 1993. 
  Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0000 GMT on 24 May 
report that after successfully completing their six-month goal, 
Ciego de Avila oil workers are determined to recover first place 
in the Black Gold program. Oil workers have extracted 34,000 
tons from the province's four oil deposits. 
  Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0000 GMT on 25 May 
report that members of the German Communist Party presented a 
donation of $14,000 to a medical center in Cerro Municipality, 
Havana City Province. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 25 May reports that the 1993-94 
tobacco harvest has virtually concluded in Pinar del Rio 
Province following the harvesting of 24.2 million poles of 
tobacco -- 450,000 more than in the previous harvest although 
121 fewer caballerias had been planted. The harvest should 
result in 300,000 quintals of tobacco -- 39,000 more than last 
year. The tobacco crop accrues $100 million annually for the 
Cuban economy. Pinar del Rio Province is the source of 70 
percent of the national tobacco crop. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 26 May reports that a Ciego de 
Avila work group is close to reaching its goal in the recovery 
of spare parts used in the national energy program. Each piece 
of equipment that is rebuilt constitutes a savings of 
approximately $1,000. This 10-man work group is also outstanding 
for its efficient use of electromagnets, nuts and bolts, and 
resistors and for recycling lubricants for electric devices. 
  The radio also reports that innovators from the Ministry of 
Construction's Enterprise No. 1 in Pinar del Rio Province have 
developed a cement-hardener made from molasses and other 
materials available locally. This guarantees a 10 percent 
savings in cement and makes the cement much easier to use. This 
saves Cuba from having to buy a chemical substance on the 
international market to use for that purpose. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1155 GMT on 26 May reports that Interior 
Ministry troops on the Isle of Youth work 107 caballerias of 
land with a view to food self-sufficiency. This unit has become 
self-sufficient in food used for workers cafeterias and the 
building of homes. The unit has built 23 houses so far. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 26 May reports on the 
development of the techno-tour exhibit at (Pavexpo) in Havana. 
A restaurant company has agreed to open a restaurant called 
Pizza Nova at the Hemingway Marina. The firms foresees 
establishing similar restaurants throughout Cuba, which should 
constitute a source of substantial income for Cuban tourism 
organizations. The Czech Republic is also participating for the 
first time at the fair. 
  Radio Reloj at 1954 GMT on 26 May reports that the factories 
in the municipalities of Camajuani and Placetas that make cigars 
for export and for local consumption fell behind by more than 
800,000 units due to power outages, causing losses exceeding $1 
million. Tobacco factories have produced 1.1 million units so 
far this month. They hope to solve the problems with a generator 
that was purchased abroad, which has not yet arrived. 
  Radio Progresso at 1100 GMT on 27 May reports that 
preliminary estimates put the damages caused by the recent 
intense rainfall in Guantanamo Province at over 90 million pesos.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 31 May (AFP) -- On Tuesday, the 
government of provisional President Emile Jonassaint, which is 
not recognized by the international community, banned members of 
the resigning administration of Prime Minister Robert Malval 
from leaving the national territory. 
  In a communique read over state television, the Ministry of 
Interior and National Defense "informs border posts and those 
concerned of the formal prohibition against leaving the country 
effective immediately for those who have to give explanations on 
their use of public funds." This measure, which also involves 
all high-ranking officials appointed by exiled President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide or Malval, is aimed at officially 
reviewing the country's accounts. 
  According to observers in Port-au-Prince, however, this 
directive may cause tension between the authorities of the 
administrations of Jonassaint and Malval, who, despite tendering 
his resignation, continues to administer current affairs while 
waiting for President Aristide to appoint a new head of 
government. 
  This measure was adopted "with the legitimate concern to 
guarantee the interests of the public administration and the 
state," the communique said. Former officials must present 
official proof of their handling of affairs at the moment of 
leaving the territory. Some of Malval's ministers are already 
abroad, according to well- placed sources. Following his 
election, Father Aristide ordered the same measure, which was 
denounced at the time as political vengeance.

with France and other countries so that he is not blamed for an 
invasion of Haiti. This weekend on a Montreal radio station, 
president-in-exile's spokesman detailed the avalanche strategy 
[strategie lavalassienne], in light of new developments in the 
Haitian crisis. He almost lost his temper in light of the 
pertinence of the questions of Compere Raymond Laurent, who had 
him unveil his government's priorities. Martineau clearly

other countries so that he is not blamed for an invasion of

  [Text] Port Au-Prince, 31 May (EFE) -- The government of 
"de facto" Prime Minister Emile Jonassaint of Haiti today 
prohibited members of the government of Former Prime Minister 
Robert Malval from leaving the country. 
  Haitian Interior Minister Joseph Willio Nouailles, that a 
notification has been sent to the Department of Migration for 
them to enforce the order. [sentence as received] 
  Meanwhile, the minister of information accused the media of 
being hired by the international community "to exaggerate" 
reports about the contentious political situation in Haiti. 
Haitian state television on Monday also accused groups 
considered "antinationalist" of promoting refugee boat trips 
just to tarnish the government's image. The Ministry of 
Information reminded the people that the Haitian Criminal Code 
articles prohibiting criticism of the authorities are still in 
effect. 
  International civilian teams from the UN and the OAS 
released 
the results of an investigation they carried out in Leogane and 
Petit Goave (30 to 50 kms south of Port-Au-Prince), which 
maintain that the human rights situation has deteriorated 
significantly in the region over the last few weeks. 
  The mission also reported that 40 people were arrested in 
the 
predawn hours of 16 to 17 May in "Trou Chouchou, a community of 
Petit Goave, when they were about to set sail for the United 
States. 
  They were part of a group of 200 people who were mistreated 
by Haitian soldiers. According to the report, the soldiers 
accused them of being supporters of Constitutional President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was overthrown in September 1991 by 
a military coup led by Gen. Raoul Cedras. The mission also 
stated that 50 people were detained and beaten on 22 May at a 
beach in Petit Goave, while trying to flee to the United States 
aboard a small boat. 
  The detained Haitians said that some of their aggressors 
were 
wearing Army uniforms and others were members of the 
ultraright-wing Front for Haiti's Advance and Progress (FRAPH). 
Two of those arrested had already been taken and held at the 
Haitian refugee camp on the U.S. military base at Guantanamo 
(Cuba), the mission said. According to UN and OAS officials, 
there were two children and four babies among those arrested, 
all of whom were locked in a cell with another 20 people.

<F P=106> [Report by Herold Jean-Francois] </F>
  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 31 May (EFE) -- The Haitian National 
Assembly special session summoned this morning by Constitutional 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide will not be held because 
parliamentarians have complained about security problems. 
  Senate Vice President Firmin Jean-Louis indicated he had 
contacted several legislators who expressed their willingness to 
participate in the special session, but stated their 
apprehension with respect to its feasibility. 
  Nevertheless, Jean-Louis disclosed that those 
parliamentarians contacted "reiterated their recognition of 
Aristide as legitimate president and expressed their willingness 
to respond favorably to his summons today and from here on." 
  On the other hand, this Tuesday, Deputy Antoine Joseph, 
former president of the Chamber of Deputies, stated Aristide is 
entitled to convene the parliamentarians, but he believed the 
president should have contacted the parliament's political 
groups before summoning the National Assembly. 
  The deputy criticized Senate President Jean-Louis, who was 
in 
a position to make the contacts prior to the president's 
summons. Joseph also pointed to the security problems the 
legislators are having and the unlikelihood the summons will 
come through. 
  Another reason, Joseph indicated, was the position adopted 
by 
Jean-Louis with respect to the 2 March parliamentary resolution 
that attempted to solve the crisis through Aristide's 
appointment of a prime minister, the retirement of General Raoul 
Cedras, and the implementation of an amnesty law. Joseph 
stressed that the Chamber of Deputies does not recognize the "de 
facto" government headed by Judge Emile Jonassaint. 
  In a letter dated 26 May and sent to Jean-Louis, Aristide 
urges the senate president to take the necessary provisions to 
summon the National Assembly on 1 June to express an opinion on 
the "11 May charade" and the illegal appointment of Jonassaint 
as de facto president by a group of senators headed by Bernard 
Sansaricq. 
  In the meantime, press reports from Haiti point out the 
deployment of troops on the border with Santo Domingo in 
response to the Dominican Government's commitment to control the 
smuggling of crude-oil-related products through the border 
shared by both Caribbean nations. 
  As a result of these new measures, the price of gasoline 
increased drastically in the free market, and this Monday and 
Tuesday, a gallon of gasoline could be purchased for $10. A 
military source told EFE that the Army has large amounts of 
gasoline for its military vehicles and those used by the 
high-ranking officers. 
  On the other hand, if the price of gasoline continues to 
increase, public transportation will be crippled in a very short 
while, and private owners will be forced to leave their vehicles 
parked at home because of the lack of resources to confront 
rising prices on the black market.

  [Text] Engineer Franck Pierre, secretary general of the 
Capois Lamort Organization of Haiti [OCLH], has called for a 
state of siege. Pierre has written Lieutenant General Raoul 
Cedras, commander in chief of the Haitian Armed Forces [FADH], 
demanding the state of siege and calling for the president of 
the Republic and Parliament to declare a state of siege to 
prepare for any possible provocation in Haiti. The current 
political sphere of influence continues to tear Haiti's social 
fabric and has led the country to a fatal deadlock, clearly 
threatening our national sovereignty with the military 
intervention of foreign powers known as Friends of Haiti. 
  The OCLH can in no way remain indifferent and idle during 
crucial points in the nation's life and has decided to save and 
defend our national independence. The OCLH earnestly and firmly 
asks the FADH high command: 1) To order a state of alert at all 
military bases in the nine geographic departments and to put the 
Army on alert; 2) To call up all officers, noncommissioned 
officers, and retired soldiers [words indistinct].

  [Text] On the night of 30 May, rumors of military 
intervention exacerbated fear and worry among Haitian families; 
rumors that the U.S. military was controlling Mais Gate Airport. 
The rumors appear to have stemmed from a U.S. officer's 
statement on the military invasion of Haiti that was 
misunderstood. 
  A reliable source told Signal FM that a U.S. Army colonel 
said U.S. authorities have decided to invade Haiti and that all 
that remains now is to determine the main targets. This Army 
colonel also said Mais Gate Airport will be one of the main 
targets.

<F P=106> [Report by Patricia Gutierrez from the "Early Morning" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The Mexican Government has expressed its total 
disagreement with the preliminary decision by U.S. authorities 
to apply taxes on Mexican exports of cement clinker and portland 
cement. The U.S. Commerce Department based its decision on the 
argument that Mexican export companies did not provide adequate 
information on Mexico's cement sales to the U.S. market. 
  Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra Puche said that if the final 
decision by the U.S. Government in August turns out to be 
adverse to the interests of Mexican cement companies, Mexico 
will present the case to the NAFTA commission. Serra Puche 
explained that a formal request will be presented to establish 
an arbitration panel to consider the correct application of the 
U.S. antidumping law in accordance with what is established in 
Chapter 19 of NAFTA. 
  Meanwhile, Trade Negotiations Under Secretary Herminio 
Blanco 
will meet with the representatives of the affected companies to 
evaluate the possibility of a public hearing that will allow 
them to explain their arguments against the U.S. Commerce 
Department's decision. The Mexican businessmen have 30 days to 
submit comments on Friday's preliminary decision, which 
established differential margins [margenes diferenciales] of 
60.33 percent for Mexican Cement and 59.91 percent for the rest 
of the companies.

  [Text] Foreign capital is prompting an excess supply of 
money which destabilized the country's economy, says the Banamex 
[National Bank of Mexico]-Accival financial group. The 
financial group added that this could lead to considerable 
devaluations of the peso with regard to the dollar and to 
interest rates, as well as to disproportionate increases in the 
Mexican Stock Market and other assets. 
  The financial group said that in the beginning, the influx 
of 
cash will not decrease rates (for the withdrawal of bills and 
coins and sterilization), it will keep the exchange rate low and 
raise the stock market index. Later on, there will be 
reactions, first in the exchange rate and then in interest 
rates, and the situation will change. Supply will become 
increasingly moderate and demand will once again increase 
through private financing. 
  In examining Mexico's economic situation in May 1994, 
Banamex's Department of Economic Studies stated the economy's 
low rate of growth is temporary because the economy has not lost 
it's solidity and because the general consensus is that 
stability is an essential requirement to achieve greater 
development. 
  Nevertheless, the Department also mentioned that recovery is 
not yet clearly visible and notes that it could be delayed or 
limited by certain salient factors. "At present, there are 
other reasons for uncertainty which, perhaps, may prompt a 
deferment of investment plans. We are also beginning to note an 
increase in manufacturing production, but this increase is not 
echoed by sales." The Department also pointed to the 
possibility that inventories may accumulate and later weaken 
production. 
  The Department likewise underscored that conditions do not 
yet exist for steady progress in private spending. A higher 
unemployment rate and the fragmentation of the labor sector have 
limited domestic spending power and made the decision to spend 
more selective, which can be attributed to individual over 
indebtedness.

<F P=106> [Report by Marcela Gutierrez from the "ACIR Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The Foreign Secretariat reported on today's meeting 
between Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello and 10 representatives of 
the print media. The main topic discussed was the 21 August 
elections. Tello said Mexico is not harmed in any way by the 
arrival of representatives from other countries or international 
organizations to learn how the Federal Electoral Institute is 
organizing the elections. He added the presence of observers 
from the United Nations and other international organizations 
helps to dispel any doubt that may exist about the elections. 
  The official noted Mexico has nothing to hide. It is quite 
the contrary, he said, since we must not only convince the 
public here but our friends abroad. The foreign secretary was 
confident the elections will be conducted in total peace because 
the people of Mexico do not want violence and do not advocate 
violence as a way to settle disputes. To conclude, he added 
that one cannot rule out irregularities in the 21 August 
elections, but he said he was confident any irregularities would 
be minimal and would not undermine in any way the whole 
electoral process. 
  During the meeting that lasted a little over two hours, 
Manuel Tello commented on the purchase of crowd control 
equipment. He said the Mexican government purchased it to 
replace the existing equipment that was acquired in 1972 or 1973 
but was never used. He indicated this may not have been the 
best time to purchase the crowd control equipment considering 
the controversy over the purchase. He noted, however, any 
responsible government has to have this sort of equipment. 
  Commenting on the visit by U.S. Democratic Congressman 
Robert 
Torricelli, who arrived on Friday in Mexico City, the foreign 
secretary said he is fully convinced the visitor will be highly 
impressed by the great effort Mexican society has made through 
its organizations and political parties to guarantee honest 
elections. He added Torricelli will go to Chiapas State where he 
may meet with Subcommander Marcos. 
  On another matter, Tello said the Mexican Government is 
holding talks with the Cuban Government to agree on the date in 
which President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will visit the 
Caribbean island, but he declined to comment further.

<F P=106> [Report by Jesus Sanchez] </F>
  [Text] Saltillo, Coahuila, 26 May -- Ernesto Zedillo fended 
off bad omens of an electoral process that is just 12 weeks 
away, rejecting predictions of a split within the PRI 
[Institutional Revolutionary Party] that would make it weak like 
in 1988, which in turn could cause its downfall in the 
presidential elections. "I do not share such a catastrophic 
outlook; not only will we be a competitive party but a winning 
party," the PRI presidential candidate said. 
  The presidential hopeful also mentioned his visit to the 
National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and said the 
arguments made by members of the University Student Council 
(CEU) -- that the university's autonomy had been violated -- 
"speak for themselves," because apparently some members of the 
CEU participated in violent acts, and "I suppose they must feel 
very embarrassed about their conduct in view of how they are 
being condemned by other parts of the university." 
  Zedillo insisted he was at UNAM "under absolutely normal 
conditions" and said political arguments that try to make it 
seem otherwise do not jive with UNAM's tradition of culture, 
plurality, and tolerance. He noted: "I was respectful, knowing 
full well that other candidates had already been there -- 
Zedillo was the first PRI candidate in UNAM's history to 
campaign there -- and I believe, for the university students, 
this has been a break with an intolerant past, a past where a 
minority infringed on the rights of a majority." 
  Zedillo explained that as a public official, he had visited 
the School of Economics once, the School of Chemistry three 
times, and research centers several times under exactly similar 
conditions. 
  In a meeting with reporters who are covering his 
presidential 
campaign activities shortly before traveling to the pro-PAN 
[National Action Party] state of Chihuahua, Zedillo answered 
other questions, all of them linked to expectations about the 
results of August's federal elections. 
  [EL FINANCIERO] Perhaps we are on the verge of entering a 
period in which the percentage of votes won by the winning 
presidential candidate will be less than 50 percent, which would 
break new historical ground. Are we ready for this? Will the 
PRI continue to be a strong party with this kind of percentage 
of the vote? 
  [Zedillo] The PRI is competing with eight parties. The 
Constitution does not include any particular provision on voting 
percentages; the Constitution refers to a relative, not an 
absolute, majority. The Constitution and the law clearly 
establish who wins the elections and how they are won. I am 
very concerned about this obsession with percentages. The 
Constitution is very clear. We are just going to enforce the 
law. 
  In a good mood, Zedillo answered reporters' questions and 
said his new invitation to opposition candidates that another 
debate be held is not a matter of seeing who extends the 
invitation first. He said: "The thing is to hold the debate, 
but I have no doubt in my mind that on 24 April I called for a 
debate and on 12 May reiterated my call. For a minute there, 
they had me as the loser." He said that he has still not 
received a formal response, adding that he hopes all candidates 
agree to a new debate. 
  A difficult issue to face was the internal conflict within 
the PRI during the selection process for candidates to Congress. 
Zedillo termed these irregularities or incidents as "normal for 
a party with the PRI's democratic and decisive participation." 
  Zedillo remarked that according to the PRI's past 
experiences 
and those of other parties now, the PRI "has had an exemplary 
process." He hopes these will be isolated events, although in 
the end the number of conflicts is minimal compared to the 
complexity of the very process. 
  [EL FINANCIERO] Are there risks of breaks or a repeat of 
what 
happened in 1988? 
  [Zedillo] No, in the process held three years ago [number as 
published] there were more incidents than there are now. Given 
circumstances in the country, it is an exemplary process; these 
incidents are normal. There is freedom in the party, and I am 
satisfied and do not foresee a risk. To the contrary, I see a 
united party, a party strengthened to wage the campaign we need 
to wage to give it our best shot. 
  Zedillo emphasized that he does not agree with the 
catastrophic vision of the country. Mexico has made 
considerable progress and although it is facing serious 
problems, the population is recognizing its own effort, Zedillo 
added. And he concluded: "I think the basic conditions, those 
that count in an electoral process will allow us to move toward 
an orderly electoral process, in terms of legality, and, in the 
PRI's case, with a strong and united party."

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] presidential 
candidate Ernesto Zedillo has invited the other candidates to 
hold a debate. 
  [Begin Zedillo recording] On 24 April, I invited two of the 
presidential candidates to a public debate. This debate, held 
on 12 May, confirmed my party's commitment to democracy. I 
invited them to debate for two reasons. First, I wished to 
demonstrate with facts that I believe firmly in the discussion 
of ideas among several persons. I am convinced the leadership 
that Mexico requires must be based on the best ideas and 
programs. Second, I am convinced that my party's proposal is 
the best, offers the greatest possibilities of turning the 
progress of the national economy into tangible benefits for the 
family economy, preserves the attainments that we, the Mexican 
people, have reached with so great sacrifices, and proposes the 
great social and juridical reform that Mexico demands. 
  On 12 May, I expressed my interest in holding a debate with 
all nine presidential candidates. Today, I wish to formalize 
this invitation, which also corresponds to the interests of the 
other parties. I propose that we hold this debate as soon as 
practicable. The country is entitled to it. The country wishes 
to continue these democratic practices. For this reason, I 
expect a prompt reply to this invitation. I am extending this 
invitation under the same principles and in the same democratic 
spirit that guided the first debate. This is to say, that the 
nine parties should discuss a format that will guarantee 
impartiality, clarity, and equity. Each of the candidates 
should be given an equal amount of time. The debate should be 
broadcast live by radio and television and a single signal 
should be used, which can be picked up and transmitted by all 
the stations that so desire. 
  This debate will meet a demand from every single one of you: 
to have better information at the time our votes are cast on 21 
August. On that day, all of us should participate in an exercise 
in responsibility and knowledge. We all desire a process that 
will conclude in peace and harmony, an exemplary electoral 
process in the history of our country. I know that we can do 
it, provided we are united. Thanks. [end recording] 
  [Later, this "24 Hours" newscast carries a report that on 7 
June the nine presidential candidates will speak during a dinner 
traditionally held by newspaper editors to commemorate Freedom 
of the Press Day. In a recorded statement, Ricardo Perete, 
president of the Association of Daily Newspapers of Mexico 
[ADIMEX], says: "It occurred to us to invite the nine candidates 
to this important meeting commemorating Freedom of the Press Day 
so they can express their views. This will not be a debate. 
Each of them will be given five minutes. They will choose 
their own topics. They will not be interrupted at all. Yes, 
there will be a moderator, who will advise the candidates when 
their time is up." Perete adds that the order for the speakers 
will be determined by a drawing to be held in the ADIMEX head 
office.]

<F P=106> [Report by Teresa Salazar from the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Six opposition candidates accepted the invitation 
Ernesto Zedillo, Mexican presidential candidate for the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party, made to hold a debate. The 
National Action Party said it will think about it. 
  Most of the candidates of the small parties accepted 
Zedillo's invitation to hold a new public debate over their 
presidential proposals. Diego Fernandez de Cevallos turned down 
the invitation but later said he would think about it. 
  [Begin Fernandez de Cevallos recording] I have said I 
believe 
it is improper to gather the nine candidates at the same place 
at the same time, however, my secretary general told me, using a 
phrase that has become famous and that has been used by 
presidents: I only ask you not to be fearful. [Solo les pido que 
no se hagan bolas]. [end recording] 
  Alvaro Perez Trevino, presidential candidate for the 
Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution, accepted the 
invitation, but said the only drawback would be if the debate 
were used to attack another candidate. 
  Jorge Gonzalez Torres, presidential candidate for the Green 
Ecologist Party, said the debate represents a point of hope for 
democracy which is demanded by the Mexican people. 
  Cecilia Soto, candidate for the Labor Party, said she is 
ready for the debate. 
  [Begin Soto recording] I understand it is a ratification of 
his 12 May proposal to hold a debate. I am ready to hold a 
debate, tonight if necessary. [end recording] 
  Rafael Aguilar Talamantes from the Cardenist Front for 
National Reconstruction Party, accepted the debate and 
designated a representative for the negotiations prior to the 
talks. 
  Pablo Emilio Madero, candidate from the National Opposition 
Union, said a civilized step forward in Mexican democracy 
depends on the confrontation of government programs. 
  Marcela Lombardo from the Popular Socialist Party confirmed 
her participation in the debate as long as it is a display of 
proposals, projects, and possible solutions to the country's 
problems.

  [Text] Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, presidential candidate for the 
Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD], said he accepts 
Ernesto Zedillo's invitation to hold a debate, but he insists 
that the initiative to hold a debate is his. 
  [Begin Cardenas recording] The candidate for the ruling 
party 
made a new invitation to the other candidates to participate in 
a debate of nine. The candidate for the ruling party seems to 
forget or does not want to listen to the other invitations made 
by other candidates, including myself, to hold a first debate 
among nine candidates. We hope it is not the only debate. The 
debates must not be regulated by the interest of the ruling 
candidate. It is time for the nine candidates, through their 
representatives, to reach an agreement on this next debate, but 
also on the other debates we may hold before 21 August. 
  I understand there should be at least three more debates 
among all candidates before 21 August. We also hope to hold 
debates among pairs of candidates. We hope all candidates can 
begin discussing this. It is not something the government or 
the Institutional Revolutionary Party candidate has to impose on 
us. It is something the candidates must agree upon amongst 
ourselves. We also have to reach agreements regarding the 
handling of the media following the debates, especially 
Televisa, Television Azteca, and Multivision. They should give 
all candidates the same opportunities to participate in what we 
may call a postdebate. This time should not be used as an 
opportunity to favor one or a few candidates to the detriment of 
the other candidates. These are the guidelines my 
representatives will be suggesting to the other candidates so 
that we can all reach an agreement and hold several debates 
before 21 August. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Lucia Domville and Jose Luis Gaona] </F>
  [Text] Mexico will become an exporting power in the next 
few years and will be able to take advantage of trade agreements 
only if a series of measures are incorporated into the 
government program for the next six-year period. 
  Presidents of business organizations and exporting firms are 
proposing a package of measures to overcome problems of 
infrastructure and bureaucracy that are afflicting the 
enterprises. These measures include: 

  -  To establish a single 
3.4-percent sales tax and eliminate other taxes. 
  -  To reduce 
financing costs and eliminate financial intermediation for 
exporters. 
  -  To privatize the country's railroads and ports. 
  -  To 
extend the deadline for the construction of roads. 
  -  To put 
together a catalog and distribute it among exporters to take 
advantage of the opportunities offered by international 
businesses. 
  -  To improve the quality of export products. 
  -  To stop 
at the border foreign products that are subsidized or that enter 
the country with prices that are below their cost to produce. 
  -  To 
create a single document to process export documents. 
  -  To 
integrate productive chains so that the country will export 
final products instead of intermediary parts. 

  According to research conducted by EL FINANCIERO among 
leaders of the business sector, Mexican businessmen face many 
barriers in their effort to compete abroad. Too much 
bureaucracy, administrative incapacity, scarce knowledge about 
trade agreements and business opportunities, the lack of access 
to low-cost financing, and poor infrastructure make foreign 
trade a difficult task that only a few businesses can challenge. 
  Private sector sources noted that a program to develop trade 
in the next six-year term is needed if the objectives are to 
take advantage of international commercial negotiations and to 
increase the flow of foreign exchange for the country in order 
to balance the trade deficit. 
  Mexico already has a basis to increase its exports, however, 
it lacks a specific support program and the difficult economic 
situation a large number of firms are going through, make it 
difficult to reduce the trade deficit with the United States. 
  According to figures released by the private sector, 
Mexico's 
trade has increased, especially with the United States. 
Seventy-five percent of Mexican products are exported to the 
United States. Trade between these two countries totalled $26 
billion in 1986 and in 1993 it was $82 billion which represents 
an annual growth of $8 billion in market value. It is estimated 
that with NAFTA and a good dissemination of market 
opportunities, however, trade with the United States could be 
accelerated and increased, in the medium term, by between $15 
billion and $20 billion per year. 
  The sources that were consulted noted that the macroeconomic 
and legal conditions (agreements and commercial treaties) are 
present for Mexico to increase its exports by more than 24 
percent. They added that what needs to be done and what should 
be done by the next government is to increase support for small 
and medium businessmen, which are the ones with the greatest 
export potential. 
  The private sector's proposals include the modernization of 
the tax collection system through a "single tax" so that 
businessmen will not be hindered by the red tape and, at the 
same time, will not become victims of a single inspector. Over 
two years ago, U.S. tax experts presented this single tax idea 
to the Finance and Public Credit Secretariat. It is a tax that 
works the same way as the value-added tax and they guaranteed 
that it would not drop but increase tax revenues. The proposal 
suggests that the single tax be set at 12 to 14 percent or 
between 3 and 4 percent over sales. The advantage is that the 
2-percent tax on assets, the 34 percent income tax, the 
5-percent Institute of the National Housing Fund for Workers 
tax, the 2-percent educational tax, the 2-percent Retirement 
Savings System tax, and the 1-percent Federal District tax would 
disappear thus simplifying the paperwork businessmen have to do. 
The flexibility proposed for these enterprises would not affect 
any of the macroeconomic variables attained during Salinas' 
six-year period. 
  They said the fiscal surplus must be used to activate the 
economy because, with liquidity, the businesses can buy supplies 
to make their export products. Lowering the cost of financing 
is another point they highlighted. Private sector members 
complained that high-cost financing affects their costs and 
eliminates their possibilities to export. Consequently, they 
propose the channeling of soft loans without intermediation. 
  According to private sector sources, the dissemination of 
market opportunities and the promotion of an exporting culture 
are part of the package to foment foreign trade. 
  A greater deregulation will increase private investment in 
the development of the country's infrastructure. Deficiencies 
in transportation make goods more expensive, therefore, the 
business sector proposes the privatization of railroads and 
ports, as well as the extension of deadlines for the 
construction of roads. 
  With regard to a single document, it suggested that the 
government create this prerequisite and eliminate all others and 
if exporters fail to tell the truth in it, an exemplary form of 
punishment must be implemented. The private sector sources 
concluded that Mexico will have its export boom when businessmen 
engage in the terminal industry [industria terminal].

  [Text] Mexico City, 26 May (NOTIMEX) -- Mexican Secretary 
of Agriculture Carlos Hank Gonzalez and the Cuban and Japanese 
ambassadors here have discussed several joint scientific and 
technological exchange projects in the field of agriculture. 
  During an interview with Cuban Ambassador Abelardo Curbelo, 
the Mexican official expressed Mexico's willingness to establish 
and expand technical and scientific relations throughout the 
continent. As an example of this, he highlighted Mexico's 
contribution of technological methods used in the production of 
corn, wheat, tubers, and vegetables, among other types of crops, 
which are not in use in several other countries. 
  Curbelo said the Cuban Government was pleased with the 
progress achieved in its trade activities with Mexico. He 
proposed extending this exchange to include genetic studies for 
improving basic grain seeds and vegetable oil crops, as well as 
several species of cattle. He also stressed the Cuban farmers' 
interest in learning about new methods of controlling 
agricultural pests and disease, currently in use in Mexico. The 
Cuban official offered to transfer sugar cane farming and 
production technology developed by his country to Mexico in 
exchange. 
  Hank Gonzalez also spoke with Japanese Ambassador Mitsuro 
Donokawi. They discussed the new conditions of the world market 
and the need to increase bilateral relations to ensure a fair 
and balanced commercial system. They also examined the 
cooperation programs currently being channeled through the 
Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The JICA is 
in charge of administrating the Japanese Government's resources 
and the development areas it supports in its beneficiary nations. 
  Furthermore, they evaluated three projects that are already 
under way. The first of these projects is a five-year 
agricultural development program for the mining communities in 
the dry desert regions of Guerrero Negro, Baja California. The 
second project is called Basic Silkworm Breeding Technology, 
which deals with silkworm breeding and collection techniques. 
This knowledge is currently applied in several states across 
the country and will receive $950,000 over five years. The 
third of these beneficiary programs is the production technology 
improvement plan for small-scale rice growers. This plan is now 
being applied in Morelos State. 
  The officials exchanged points of view on another nine 
projects currently under evaluation for future implementation. 
An agricultural modernization plan, a reconversion study for 
Tapachula, an agricultural equipment and machinery test and 
evaluation center, and residual waters recycling and usage 
techniques for more efficient irrigation are some of the more 
significant topics being discussed.

<F P=106> [By Julian Rodriguez Marin] </F>
  [Text] Mexico City, 28 May (EFE) -- Drug trafficking has 
permeated all Mexican political structures and has corrupted 
federal, state, and municipal officials who commercialize the 
application of justice, Eduardo Valle, who resigned from the 
post of adviser to the attorney general for this reason, has 
told EFE. 
  When asked by EFE if he is afraid that drug traffickers 
might 
make an attempt on his life for making these accusations, he 
answered: "If they want to kill you, they will. I walk around 
without protection, without bullet-proof vests or bodyguards." 
  The Attorney General's Office (PGR) was able to obtain the 
most complete information on drug trafficking in Mexico, but it 
was unable to eradicate drug trafficking because government 
structures at all levels are corrupted by drug money, the former 
adviser said. 
  "Narcopower" has deformed the economy; it is a cancer that 
has generated economic, financial, and political dependence, 
which instead of producing goods has created serious problems 
and distortions ultimately affecting honest businessmen, Valle 
said. 
  "The struggle against drug trafficking is a problem like 
physics; there is no absolute vacuum, when one group is 
eliminated another immediately takes its place," he affirmed. 
  "Narcopower" has permeated the political structure; the 
three 
most important drug trafficking groups -- the groups of Amado 
Carrillo, Arellano Felix, and Juan Garcia Abrego -- which are 
accused of approximately 35 killings and about 200 murders, have 
a bearing on the main decisions of the country, the former 
adviser revealed. 
  Eduardo Valle, who was a leader in the 1968 student movement 
and in the Mexican Workers Party, said no one can knowingly 
sponsor an initiative against drug trafficking because if he 
does, he will die. 
  Valle, known in political circles by his student nickname, 
"El Buho," explained he will leave the PGR without any 
protection. He has been a federal deputy and president of the 
Union of Democratic Journalists. 
  "Neither bullet-proof vests nor several bodyguards; my only 
protection is my fellow journalists," Valle remarked. "I came 
to the PGR committed to fighting against drug trafficking. 
Regrettably, I was criticized for that decision, but they must 
know the problem is not where you are, but what do you do, how 
committed you are," Valle added. 
  "I came to fight without hesitation against drug trafficking 
networks, and I am leaving because it is impossible to eradicate 
these groups, since they have infiltrated all sectors," Valle 
asserted. He added it would be suicidal and a massacre would 
occur if there were an attempt to try and enter the domains of 
the mafia without the support of all police forces. 
  Valle said at least 10 drug cartels are operating in Mexico, 
although the most important ones are three that maintain ties 
with the Cali Cartel (Colombia) and the incipient Peru Cartel. 
These organizations handle thousands of millions of dollars. 
  The Arellano Felix organization has links to the most 
important drug trafficking mafias in the world, with Europe, and 
with the group of Asian nations called the "golden triangle of 
drug trafficking" (Thailand, Cambodia, and Burma), Valle noted. 
  Drug trafficking organizations have employed government 
officials at all levels, representatives of the legislative and 
judiciary branches, and representatives of Mexican security 
forces, Valle expressed. 
  During the "golden period," between 1988 and 1989, the 
Matamoros Cartel led by Juan Garcia Abrego introduced six tons 
of cocaine weekly into the United States. It is estimated over 
100 tons were introduced annually. 
  The Matamoros Cartel security chief is former Navy officer 
Rafael Olvera, "El Rafles," who heads a small army of 70 
well-equipped and well-armed men. 
  Pedro Aspe Armella, Mexico's secretary of finance and public 
credit, has admitted while in the United States that the 
influence of drug trafficking is in all structures of political 
and social life in Mexico. "And the secretary came up short 
because drug trafficking not only infiltrates the federal 
government, but also state and municipal governments as well as 
national legislative, executive, and judicial branches," the 
former adviser remarked. 
  Drug trafficking groups in Mexico have grown and handle not 
only tons of cocaine, but also hundreds of tons of marijuana 
that are planted throughout the country. 
  Valle regretted that the presidential candidates have not 
properly addressed this cancer and have not presented a 
political project proposing an all-out war against drug 
trafficking. So far only church representatives have demanded 
an all-out struggle against drug trafficking.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 31 May. 
  Preliminary forecasts by the National Foreign Trade Council 
show that Mexican exports to the United States reached $4.5 
billion in April, a 6-percent increase over exports in March. 
(Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 24 May 94 p 22) 
  The Finance and Public Credit Secretariat has reported that 
from 1990 to date, Mexico's public foreign debt has negatively 
affected the international exchange of the dollar as compared 
with other currencies. The report adds that in the first three 
months of 1994 the balance of Mexico's foreign debt rose to 
$1.116 billion. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 25 May 94 
pp 1, 4, 3A) 
  Francisco Rojas, director of Mexican Petroleum (PEMEX), has 
announced that a huge oil deposit has been discovered in the 
Jujo-Tecominoacan field, Tabasco State, with reserves estimated 
at 431 million barrels of crude oil. Rojas also reported that 
PEMEX will launch the Olmeca Project which is designed to 
increase the utilization of light crude reserves from the 
Mezozoico Chiapas- Tabasco deposits. He added that the 
development of the Caan, Ek-Balam, and Taruntunich fields will 
produce revenues of $1.3 billion, which will allow PEMEX to 
fully recover all of its 1993 and 1994 investments. (Mexico 
City LA JORNADA in Spanish 25 May 94 pp 1, 52) 
  EL FINANCIERO has conducted some economic research that 
shows 
Mexico does not have the capacity to retain foreign 
reinvestments aimed at increasing productivity because profits 
sent abroad amount to $1.41 billion, which is 25 percent higher 
than last year's figure. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 
25 May 94 pp 1, 4, 3A) 
  Finance and Public Credit Minister Pedro Aspe Armella has 
reported that although jobs have increased at assembly plants 
and commercial establishments, the number of workers registered 
with the Mexican Social Security Institute has decreased 1.3 
percent over the first three months of 1994. Aspe added that 
the unemployment rate during the same period is the highest in 
the past six years. He explained that the unemployment rate was 
3.8 percent in January, 3.7 percent in February, and 3.6 percent 
in March. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 27 May 94 p 25) 
  Victor Manuel Terrones Lopez, president of National 
Association of Processing Industry, has stated that the Mexican 
private sector will not give into pressure from U.S. 
industrialists and farmers who want Mexico to expedite the 
lifting of tariffs on various products under NAFTA. Terrones 
Lopez pointed out that the U.S. industrialists and farmers have 
prepared a list that would place Mexico at a disadvantage. The 
list contains food, chemical, plastic, and manufactured 
products. (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 
27 May 94) 
  The World Bank has granted loans for $80 million to support 
educational programs in Mexico over the next five years, 
according to a spokesman for the World Bank. (Mexico City 
NOTIMEX in Spanish 2155 GMT 27 May 94) 
  On 27 May, PEMEX reported that Mexico had exported 1,338,900 
barrels of crude oil per day during the first three months of 
the year. The oil went to Europe, the Far East, and the United 
States. (Paris AFP in Spanish 0029 GMT 28 May 94) 
  The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has granted Mexico 
a $150 million credit for development projects connected with 
Cancun's recreational and tourism facilities. (Mexico City 
NOTIMEX in Spanish 0259 GMT 28 May 94) 
  A study prepared by the National Bank of Mexico (BANAMEX) 
points out that the private sector's level of indebtedness with 
the banking system has become an obstacle for overall economic 
growth. The report describes statements by some experts who 
predict there will be economic growth of more than 3 percent in 
1994 as "exaggerated optimism." The BANAMEX study adds that 
1994's economic growth will be approximately 2 percent. (Mexico 
City LA JORNADA in Spanish 30 May 94 p 53)

  [Text] Guatemala City, 31 May (NOTIMEX) -- Unidentified 
individuals tonight detonated two bombs in different places in 
Guatemala City, according to the volunteer fire department. 
  The fire department chief, Emilio Najera, told NOTIMEX that 
one of the bombs exploded in front of the home of the brother of 
Monsignor Rodolfo Quezada Toruno, bishop of Zacapa and the 
former mediator in negotiations between the government and the 
guerrillas. The second bomb went off at Climat, a store located 
in the exclusive Zone 9 of this capital. 
  Firemen did not specify the type of explosives used in the 
attacks, both of which caused considerable damage but no 
casualties. The attacks were carried out on the Day of 
Constitutionality, just 24 hours before the peace talks between 
the government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity 
(URNG) are due to resume in Mexico.

<F P=106> [Report by Julio Armando Valdez; all figures as heard] </F>
  [Text] Hugo Noe Pino, president of the Central Bank of 
Honduras [BCH], explained at a news conference his monetary plan 
aimed at reducing inflation and the fiscal deficit. 
  Asked about one of the resolutions aimed at establishing the 
percentage that banks, savings and loans associations, and 
currency exchange houses have to pay everyday to the BCH, he 
replied that this figure will increase from 0.50 percent to 
0.100 percent; in other words, the BCH administration is 
authorized to handle 60-90 percent of the available foreign 
currency according to needs and thus avoid speculation and 
pressure on the Honduran currency. 
  Pino clarified the doubts that have arisen on this among 
business and commercial sectors: 
  [Begin Pino recording] Sincerely and unfortunately there has 
been a terrible misunderstanding on this decision. Why? 
Because the BCH sets a percentage to purchase from the banking 
system and for a long time this has been 30 percent. This is 
the rate at which the BCH has been purchasing. A week ago the 
BCH decided to increase the amount from 30 to 40 percent. But 
why did we decide to go to 40 percent? What does the BCH use 
this 40 percent for? First of all, it uses it to pay the 
foreign debt; often to pay for infrastructure and various 
projects that benefit society as a whole. Second, the BCH pays 
the oil bill -- oil that not only the government uses but 
society as a whole. Third, in view of the imbalances we have 
pointed out, the BCH has the obligation to increase 
international reserves to strengthen the national economy. I 
insist, it is not true that the BCH is purchasing 50 percent of 
the foreign currency. Right now we are purchasing 40 percent due 
to Honduran society's needs. It should be clearly understood 
that the measures adopted by the BCH are to attend to affairs 
that are vital to the national economy. [end recording] 
  When referring to how the fiscal deficit will be reduced, 
which right now is at 11.2 percent, Pino explained: 
  [Begin Pino recording] We have told the international 
organizations that such a reduction is practically impossible. 
Right now we are negotiating an intermediate point that will 
also allow us to reduce the fiscal deficit, because we are 
unable to finance it in full -- a balance between reducing the 
deficit and fulfilling needs such as health, education, and 
other programs that are definitely needed by the country. [end 
recording] 
  Hugo Noe Pino said that interest rates for BCH repeat 
discounts [redescuentos] will be kept at 19 percent and this 
rate will be reviewed quarterly. The banking cash reserve 
[encaje] will be set at 34 percent of the fiscal income and 
establish the percentage that banks, saving and loans 
associations, and currency exchange houses are obliged to sell 
foreign currency to government banks every day. Regarding the 
banking cash reserve Pino added: 
  [Begin Pino recording] The legal banking cash reserve, which 
is the legal percentage of deposit reserves that banks have to 
keep, by obligation, at the BCH, remains the same. The only 
thing we have done is that the 34 percent has also been applied 
to deposits by public institutions -- in other words tax 
deposits, ENEE [National Enterprise for Electric Power] payments 
by the public through banks and savings and loans institutions, 
payments by the public for other services such as SANAA 
[National Autonomous Aqueduct and Sewage Service], and Hondutel 
[Honduran Telecommunications Enterprise]. This means that all we 
have done has been to broaden the banking cash reserve base. We 
have not increased it but have said, you, the banking system 
gentlemen have these resources and in this case these resources 
will also be subject to the legal banking cash reserve system. 
[end recording] 
  Regarding prohibitions that Congress may apply in the case 
of 
foreign currency auctions, Hugo Noe Pino explained: 
  [Begin Pino recording] The BCH, as director of foreign 
exchange policies, should not have such a prohibition. In the 
event the BCH at a given moment decides to exercise this 
control, it will be announced publicly in advance. I want to 
emphatically stress that the BCH has not decided to hold any 
foreign currency auctions. I want to first of all reiterate 
that it is not true that 50 percent is being purchased, as I 
have already stated; we are only purchasing 40 percent. [end 
recording] 
  Hugo Noe Pino concluded by saying that among other 
resolutions, the monetary program should be accompanied by other 
measures applied to the fiscal deficit, such as limiting banking 
system internal credit to the public sector to 1.11 billion 
lempiras and establish overall financing of about 1.36 billion 
lempiras. He also added that he will not resign at the first 
signs of rough weather and will remain in the post as BCH 
president as long as President Carlos Roberto Reina so desires.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Honduran economic developments monitored through 31 
May. 
  The Central Bank of Honduras has ordered private banks to 
transfer 50 percent of the foreign exchange they receive from 
export transactions to the Central Bank. This measure will 
worsen the liquidity situation experienced by the Honduran 
private banks. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1847 GMT 25 May 94) 
  The Honduran Government on 26 May ordered a freeze on the 
price of all petroleum byproducts. The measure is aimed at 
ensuring that distributors do not arbitrarily increase the price 
of these products. The freeze will continue in effect until 
further notice. (Tegucigalpa EL PERIODICO DE HONDURAS in Spanish

  [Text] Army General Humberto Ortega Saavedra, commander in 
chief of the Sandinist People's Army [EPS], on 23 May met with 
Juan Diego Castro, Costa Rican government and public security 
minister [title as heard], and with Deputy Ministers Laura 
Chinchilla and Oscar Alban in San Jose. They discussed how 
desirable it was to sign a general agreement similar to the one 
signed on in Managua on 28 August 1992 between the Costa Rican 
Government and Public Security Ministry and the EPS. 
  The new agreement will allow a more efficient coordination 
of 
all border issues to better fight smuggling, drug trafficking, 
cattle rustling, illegal alien smuggling, and gunrunning, as 
well as to coordinate maritime patrols. They also agreed to 
increase and standardize coordination mechanisms to reinforce 
the operations carried out by the civil defense of the two 
countries, especially mutual aid and communications during 
natural disasters and joint maneuvers to facilitate the 
protection of the environment. 
  Relations of respect and understanding have existed between 
the two institutions for a long time and were made evident once 
more.

  [Text] Nicaraguan Resistance Vice President Jose Rivas has 
expressed his views on the Haitians refugees that the U.S. wants 
Nicaragua to accept. 
  [Begin Rivas recording] We view the plight of the Haitians 
as 
regrettable. The Nicaraguan Government's policy is strictly for 
export purposes. Here in Nicaragua we are very much aware of 
the situation we are confronting. Here in Nicaragua more than 
50 percent of the work force is unemployed. We do not believe 
it would be advisable for people from other countries, in this 
case Haiti, to come here when we cannot solve the problems of 
the Nicaraguan people. The government has implemented many 
economic plans that have not worked out. Many Nicaraguans 
cannot understand why. I believe that if we were to accept 
Haitian refugees in Nicaragua we would face situations which 
would be difficult to describe at this time. We do not believe 
Nicaragua should be a laboratory to test this type of social 
program. They are overlooking the real situation experienced by 
the Nicaraguan people. I do not believe this would be good for 
us and it worries us. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Edgard Barberena S.] </F>
  [Text] President Violeta Chamorro has approved and ordered 
the publication in the official newspaper LA GACETA the changes 
to Articles 192 and 195, in compliance with an agreement reached 
between the Political Council of Blocs [Consejo Politico de 
Bancadas] and the Executive Branch, thus easing the tension in 
relations between the Presidency of the Republic and the 
Legislative Assembly. 
  After signing the changes, which opened the door to in-depth 
change of the Political Constitution through a project reached 
by consensus among the seven blocs, the president sent a letter 
to Legislative Branch leader Dr. Luis Humberto Guzman. 
  The essence of the presidential letter reads: "I think, 
however, that it is my duty as president of the Republic and 
chief of state to say clearly that I have reservations about the 
legality of these constitutional changes, because they change 
the procedure for guarantees established by the National 
Constituent Assembly that allows the regular National Assembly 
to enact partial changes to the Political Constitution of the 
Republic." 
  The president added that "this is why I had not yet 
promulgated these, because my first and most important duty and 
responsiblity is to comply and enforce compliance with the 
Constitution of the Republic." 
<H5>  SPEAKS OF DANGER </H5>
  The president thinks that "these changes jeopardize 
constitutional order because they leave the Constitution 
unprotected and exposed to changes by the parliament as if it 
were a regular law." But, "aware of the need to ease tension in 
relations among institutions and to build understanding between 
these two state branches, I have proceeded to promulgate them, 
in the understanding that subsequent changes to the Constitution 
will necessarily be the product of basic political consensus, at 
least between the state branches, as a guarantee of the 
feasibility of such changes, to ensure that they receive 
national approval." 
  Finally, the president pointed out to the chief of the 
Legislative Branch that "for this reason I will support those 
changes that serve the homeland or common good above partisan 
interests or specific situations." 
  Chamorro's decision is historic because this is the first 
time that changes to the Basic Law have entered into force. 
This law was approved by the AN [National Assembly] in late 
1986 and entered into force on 10 January 1987 during a ceremony 
at Revolution Square, where 202 articles of the Constitution 
were signed by Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega. 
<H5>  TIMELY DECISION </H5>
  Legislative sources told us yesterday evening that the 
presidential decision came right after the expiration of a 
deadline that the Executive Branch had established for the 
Political Council of Blocs regarding the sanctioning of the 
first changes to the Political Constitution. 
  It was reported that the package of changes to the Political 
Constitution that continues to be secretly held by the Political 
Council of Blocs will be officially presented to the Legislative 
Branch within two weeks, at the latest, to comply with 
legislative procedures, which will necessarily lead to the 
establishment of a "special commission to change the Political 
Constitution." 
  This "special commission" must -- within a prudent period -- 
establish a timetable for consultations on the project that will 
change a little over 50 percent of existing constitutional 
articles.

  [Text] The Executive ended four years of uncertainty on tax 
matters in the country's economic sectors when it issued 
yesterday a presidential decree eliminating the discretionary 
power of ministries and state autonomous and decentralized 
entities to establish or modify taxes. Henceforth, this 
authority will be centralized in the Presidency. 
  Article one of Decree 21-94 reads: "The authority granted to 
ministries and autonomous and decentralized entities of the 
Executive Branch to establish, change, or modify any tax or to 
change the amounts of rates and the highest or lowest limits on 
corresponding fiscal fines is repealed." 
  Different economic segments had been demanding for a long 
time the elimination of the ministers' discretionary authority, 
and this is part of the commitments the government made with the 
IMF to sign the ESAF [Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility]. 
  Finance Minister Emilio Pereira and Eduardo Belli, deputy 
economy and development minister, yesterday unveiled before the 
local press a package of nine legal instruments that in the 
opinion of these officials "establish clear rules of the game to 
give confidence to productive sectors and allow them to grow at 
a faster pace than the current one." 
  The package includes two agreements between the Finance and 
the Economy and Development Ministries, two Finance Ministry 
agreements, and five presidential decrees, including decrees 
20-94 and 21-94. The former makes it obligatory to publish in 
the official gazette all the executive decrees and 
administrative provisions on fiscal matters. The latter repeals 
the discretionary authorities ministers had to create, change, 
or modify any tax. 
  Decrees 22-94 and 23-94 create the Temporary Protection 
Tariff [Arancel Temporal de Proteccion] (ATP) and the Specific 
Consumption Tax [Impuesto Especifico al Consumo] (IEC), which 
repeal the Selective Consumption Tax (IBS) as of 1 July. In 
addition, decree 24-94 establishes the tariff ceilings for 
imported products, based on a timetable that establishes 37 
percent as the maximum amount that can charged until 1 July 
1995; 35 percent, until 1 January 1996; and 32 percent, until 1 
January 1997. 
  The ATP falls in line with the "exceptional and unequal 
treatment" the Central American governments granted to Nicaragua 
in the Guatemala Protocol and protects up to 750 kinds of 
products manufactured by local industries, products not produced 
in the country, although the established capacity to produce 
them exists. This holds true for products that may be produced 
in Nicaragua based on potential agroindustrial development. 
  The ceilings established are 15 percent as of 1 June 1994, 
12 
percent as of 1 July 1995, 10 percent as of 1 January 1996, 5 
percent as of 1 January 1999, until reaching 0 percent in 2000. 
  According to Deputy Minister Belli, the APT will allow 
industrial modernization, establish "clear rules" until 2000, 
let industry reap the benefits of the Central American 
integration, and strengthen the competitive capacity of 
industries. 
  "The ATP must be viewed as something that will allow the 
strengthening of productive sectors and must not be translated 
into [higher] prices for consumers, rather into productive 
capacity and more capital to cope with industrial modernization 
and penetrate new markets," Belli noted. 
  In addition, the IEC eliminates the peculiarity of the 
"escalating" charge, which had drawn protests from merchants and 
industrialists. Unlike the IBS, which was paid in customs and 
in the sales prices, the IEC will only be paid on customs during 
the introduction of the imported product. The same decree 
establishes a special regime for imported goods of the so-called 
"fiscal industry," namely, sodas, liquors, and cigarettes, which 
will only be taxed on the sale price. The other decrees and 
ministerial agreements complement the aforementioned decrees. 
  Pereira stated the agreements are the product of consensus 
with the Chamber of Industry of Nicaraguan [Cain] and the 
Chamber of Commerce. Cadin Vice President Jaime Bengochea and 
Chamber of Commerce President Roberto Teran accompanied the 
officials during the news conference and said they felt 
satisfied. 
  "We are reaching an agreement that allows us to lay the 
groundwork for a tax reform that will take us into the 21st 
century," Pereira noted. 
  Finance Deputy Minister Rene Vallecillo explained that the 
decrees seek to "influence through taxes the level and structure 
of consumption to transfer resources to the productive sector by 
means of public investments and loans for production." 
  Vallecillo added that it is not that import taxes are going 
up, but that taxes for the import sector are being consolidated. 
"The idea is not to raise rates in some sectors, but the 
contrary, since rates on items such as home appliances, work 
vehicles, and farming spare parts have experienced a reduction 
or a restructuring," the official noted.

  [Text] Surpassing every attendance prediction, more than 
200 Sandinist cadres representing all segments of society forged 
ahead with what they now call the Sandinist Renewal Movement 
[Movimiento Renovador Sandinista] in an meeting held Friday 
night at the IPADE [Institute for the Development of Democracy]. 
  Dr. Sergio Ramirez opened the meeting with an analysis of 
the 
Special Congress, stressing that programmatic views were given 
little attention, even though this was the primary purpose 
behind convening the congress. 
  Dr. Ramirez said that in order to save Sandinism and make it 
viable in future elections, the inferior leadership that was 
elected at the congress had to be left behind, because this kind 
of FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] does not have the 
remotest possibility of influencing the rest of Nicaraguan 
society. 
  The participants marched on stage and, putting aside the 
topic of the authenticity of the FSLN Congress, focused on 
offering formulas for continuing the work of the renewal current. 
  They all agreed that the job had just begun and that a great 
deal of work remained to be done. Taking advantage of the fact 
that representatives from nearly every department were present, 
they began to outline the work that will be conducted nationwide. 
  Those in attendance were informed that the "purges" 
conducted 
in the congress were rejected both at home and abroad. They 
also learned about the widespread feelings of Sandinists who do 
not belong to the squalid structures and who oppose the control 
the conservative sector has gained over the party leadership. 
  Some speakers predicted the National Directorate will veer 
to 
the right in alliance with COSEP [Higher Council of Private 
Enterprise]. The conservative trend was revealed during a news 
conference held by the reelected secretary general after the 
congress concluded.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Carlos F. Chamorro] </F>
  [Text] To those who take a traditional approach to party 
politics, any possibility of renewing the program, bylaws, and 
leadership of the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] is 
subordinate to the higher objective of preserving internal 
unity. Under different historical circumstances, this approach, 
when the party was in power, enforced discipline in the FSLN, 
and unity set a limit on change. Now, however, when we are in 
the opposition, we cannot afford not to change. Unity, which is 
misunderstood as an end in itself, is ceasing to be a vehicle 
for change and is winding up as a straitjacket on thinking. This 
restrictive approach has given rise to the mistaken attempt to 
build a revolutionary party in the image and likeness of its own 
apparatus, but behind the back of its huge constituency. This 
was the predominant trend at the recent assemblies in Masaya and 
Leon, where the pursuit of sectarian dominance in the name of 
unity emerged. 
  The other proposal in Sandinism is to struggle for unity by 
bringing the FSLN and its responsibilities before society. From 
this perspective the challenge is not to maintain unity in the 
abstract but rather to adapt the party so that it brings 
together the majority of Sandinists who are now scattered: to 
unite, open up, and grow, and to design a political strategy 
that, from the existing spheres of power and the spheres yet to 
be developed in civil society, will enable us to forge alliances 
and broaden the involvement and influence of grassroots sectors. 
  We live in times of ongoing crisis. The famous ESAF is 
tantamount to three straight years of an explosive socioeconomic 
situation. Opposing the IMF's economic program requires a 
Sandinism that can take effective action amid the dynamics of 
all segments of society: peasants, unions, associations of 
producers and businessmen, consumers, the unemployed, women, 
young people, professionals, etc. It demands a party that places 
respect for the autonomy of social and union movements before 
the temptation of a vanguard to direct all struggles by remote 
control through a Staff. Above all, it demands a leadership that 
in its commitment to accompany and support the just struggles of 
the people, takes up before the people, the responsibility to 
exert its influence to do away with violent methods of struggle. 
Nothing has damaged Sandinism's political credibility more than 
its ambiguity about condemning violence. 
  Moreover, we are facing a crisis of credibility in all 
national and state political institutions, and no definite end 
to polarization is in sight. The greatest danger is that while 
Aleman's right-wing authoritarian agenda has already become an 
electoral option, the FSLN remains trapped in the painful 
process of shedding its skin. 
<H5>  Lessons and Options </H5>
  A great deal of the shilly-shallying reflected in the 
current 
high-flown debate can be clarified in light of the recent 
election campaign along the Atlantic Coast and its outcome. 
  The elections along the coast erased Sandinism's false 
dichotomies in one fell swoop: Is it a revolutionary or an 
electoral party? Is it leftist or Social Democrat? Should it win 
votes or minds? Should it be an opposition party or a government 
partner? Should it wage a grass-roots or a congressional 
struggle? 
  The FSLN set out to be a winning electoral party, albeit 
without full cognizance or nationwide consistency, and it 
failed. It reaffirmed that elections are the only legitimate 
path to power (even though some still privately deny this fact) 
but it did not succeed in putting together a victorious 
strategy. And in the end, even though it was defeated, Sandinism 
is still struggling tenaciously to influence the composition and 
program of the regional governments in order to stem the 
influence and control of the right. There, as in the rest of the 
country, the Front does not want to be in the opposition forever. 
  There are those, however, who cling to the ideological view 
that the quality and political awareness of votes is more 
important than their number in realizing the desire for power. 
But if we want to attack the structural roots of poverty and 
social injustice, we must all acknowledge that votes do indeed 
add up and are decisive in setting any government program in 
motion. 
  Sandinism must become convinced that what happened in the 
1990 national election must not be repeated in 1996. It is one 
thing to lose power and become the leading political force in a 
country; it would be another thing, and a catastrophic one, to 
lose again and become the number two or three electoral force. 
That would condemn the FSLN to the status of a party that 
repeatedly loses, a true minority party that might be very 
cohesive ideologically but that would be less and less able to 
influence the destiny of the nation and the defense of the 
people's interests. 
  This is why I feel that the FSLN's most important goal, with 
the backing or in spite of the Special Congress, is to lay the 
groundwork for a political strategy, marked by an electoral 
approach, to sway a majority and gain power in 1996. Only a 
program of renewal that can get the FSLN moving again through 
viable proposals to society and through a credible leadership, 
will be able to do this. I wonder: How else can the FSLN capture 
the imagination of a million new young voters in 1996? 
  It is altogether untrue that it is too early to place this 
item on the agenda. We need only acknowledge how much headway 
the right's platform has made to realize that we are far behind. 
And the only way to begin closing the gap is to place 
Sandinism's true options before it: not the false dilemma of 
unity or division, but rather the choice between renewal now and 
certain political defeat in 1996. There is no other way.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Oscar Rene Vargas] </F>
<H5>  [22 Apr p 11] </H5>
  [Text] Four years into the Chamorro government, the 
characteristics of Sandinism's internal political process can be 
summarized as follows: 
  1. The results of the February 1990 elections showed that 
the 
social and grass-roots movement had entered a phase marked by 
the retreat of the mass movement. They also showed that the 
traditionally impoverished sectors and the middle class that had 
grown poor during the last half of the 1980's voted for change. 
  Four years after the elections, however, poverty has 
worsened 
and the retreat of the social movement has intensified. One of 
the major accomplishments of the Chamorro government is that 
despite the worsening of almost all social indicators, a new 
period marked by the rise of the grass-roots movement has not 
begun. The political and economic initiative remains in the 
hands of those who are pushing the counterreform. 
<H5>  Leadership and Strategy </H5>
  2. Since the day after its defeat the FSLN [Sandinist 
National Liberation Front] has been immersed in a necessary 
internal debate on the tactics and strategy to be followed 
during the current stage of stagnation and retreat for the 
grass-roots movement. All factions are worried about the future 
of the FSLN: how to regain the political ground that it has lost 
and how to develop the best tactics to regain power in the 1996 
elections. The crux of the disagreement is how to reassemble the 
political forces that became scattered after the 1990 electoral 
defeat into a government alternative in 1996. 
  3. The social and grass-roots resistance to the policies of 
the "neoliberal" government has been spontaneous, isolated, 
circumstantial, without long-term political organization and 
guidance. 
  The FSLN's political leadership has been unable to begin an 
internal debate that would help formulate a strategy that can 
coordinate and combine the various pockets of social resistance 
and, at the same time, place them properly in the current 
correlation of political forces. 
  A tactic must be urgently implemented to preserve the 
political, social, and economic clout of the progressive forces 
so that they can retake the political and social initiative and 
overcome current limitations. This means changing styles of 
leadership, which can be achieved only by making substantial 
changes in the current political leadership. 
<H5>  Impoverishment and the FSLN </H5>
  4. The lack of a clear FSLN strategy and the frustration of 
most people over the Chamorro government's failure to keep any 
of its campaign promises have been and may remain the breeding 
ground for the risky, spontaneous actions of the masses. They 
could also turn major segments of the population into the social 
base of the far right, which speaks the language of populism. We 
must remember the example of the PLC [Constitutionalist Liberal 
Party] in the Atlantic Coast elections in February 1994 and the 
Italian elections in March 1994. 
  Moreover, the increased poverty among the population does 
not 
necessarily benefit the FSLN; rather, it could lead to 
"political apathy among major segments of the people" or become 
a "spearhead" for Nicaragua's far right. In order to prevent the 
right from capitalizing on the population's current discontent, 
there must be a shakeup in the FSLN leadership. 
  The victory of the left-wing forces favoring "democratic 
socialism" in Poland in the October 1993 elections was based on 
cutting ties to the past, maintaining discipline in the party, 
backing reforms to establish a flourishing economy, and 
reassuring voters that the party is a stable and revamped 
political force. 
  5. The strategic defeat of "real socialism," which was 
heavily influenced by the Stalinist political model, has ceased 
to be the political reference point for many FSLN activists; 
this has made possible the natural emergence of various factions 
within it. 
<H5>  [23 Apr p 7] </H5>
  [Text] 6. We find three schools of thought in the FSLN, 
although they are embodied in just two organized factions: 
  a) Those who think that all is lost and who are feverishly 
seeking any way to join with the people who won the 1990 
elections. They have forsaken the struggle for "democratic 
socialism" and, influenced by the retreat of the grassroots 
movement, feel that the FSLN will not regain power through 
elections. Owing to these factors and to opportunism, they have 
decided that now is the time to switch sides so that they can 
enjoy cushy jobs under the current government or a future one. 
  b) Those who think that in spite of the defeat of "real 
socialism" nothing has changed. They adhere to "orthodox" and 
"rigid" positions regarding their methods of struggle and feel 
that the status quo in the FSLN political leadership must be 
maintained at all costs. The leaders of this faction confuse 
short-run successes with strategic victories and replace an 
analysis of the real world with political rhetoric from the era 
of the struggle against the Somoza dictatorship or with the 
language that was used during the revolution, which a majority 
of the population rejected in the 1990 elections. 
  c) Those of us who acknowledge defeat are engaged in 
intensive self-criticism and are working to develop specific 
tactics that will enable us to set immediate new political goals 
that must be redefined in a wide-ranging, open discussion inside 
the FSLN. This does not mean abandoning the struggle for a more 
just society or setting aside the grievances about which broad 
segments of the population feel most strongly. We simply feel 
that the FSLN must tailor its tactics to the political 
circumstances in which we find ourselves, and this means a 
shakeup if we want to return to power in 1996. 
  7. Because of the lack of an incisive, serious discussion 
and 
owing to the preservation of the status quo in the FSLN 
leadership at the 1991 Congress, we have lost the political 
initiative and failed to delve more deeply into the meaning of 
the strategic defeat in 1990. It is precisely because no 
political changes have been made in the FSLN leadership that an 
in-depth analysis of the current situation and of the role that 
the FSLN ought to be playing is not being conducted. 
  8. Some mid- and upper-level leaders have not openly 
accepted 
the failure of the Sandinist agenda in its version for the 
1990's. They want to preserve anachronistic language and 
leaders; they refuse to accept that they do not represent the 
best chance for the FSLN to recapture the vote of the people. 
<H5>  Criteria for Renewal </H5>
  9. There are two major requirements that the FSLN must 
fulfill in order to present a new face to the majority of the 
people, and both can be met at the next Special Congress: 
  a) Most of the members of the FSLN's next political 
leadership must come from the rank and file. In other words, 
only half of the political leadership ought to be members of the 
current National Directorate and National Assembly. We cannot 
talk about a political renewal if we merely propose a rotation 
of the personnel who were responsible directly or indirectly for 
the defeat in 1990. We are not in favor of a purge either. Some 
degree of historic continuity must be preserved in the FSLN, 
combining experience with input from new leaders who can spur 
new solutions and alternatives. 
  b) The Special Congress has a responsibility to elect not 
just a new and different political leadership but also a 
leadership that is not linked to the "pinata." We cannot promote 
a political renewal unless it is accompanied by an ethical and 
moral renewal. In other words, the new leadership cadres of the 
FSLN must emerge from the rank and file and not be linked to the 
"pinata." Unless these two minimum conditions are met, we will 
be jeopardizing any possibility of winning the 1996 election. 
  10. We must keep a cool head and not meddle in problems or 
involve ourselves in unnecessary political commotion. What we 
are proposing is a rejection of economic, political, and social 
improvisation. We must become standard-bearers of the policy 
that the privatizations must be transparent and we must call for 
the monitoring of CORNAP [National Corporation of the Public 
Sector] sales. We must aspire to once again become the moral 
conscience of the people. 
  11. Sandinism needs to rejuvenate itself, to become viable 
and credible. The poor need a new hope free from the stumbling 
blocks of the past and with a new, consistent, rectifying 
leadership that does not renounce its principles but is instead 
able to harness the mistakes of the right wing and the 
government in order to build a new social consensus with the 
people.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Was There a Steamroller at the Congress?"] </F>
  [Text] Now that the passion that overpowered the Sandinist 
Special Congress has died down, one must review what went on 
behind the scenes. 
  The so-called "Majority Current" and the "Democratic Left" 
canceled each other out. Take, for example, the lists of 113 
candidates for Sandinist Assembly membership to be elected at 
the Congress. Only five were registered on both lists. That 
does not mean that all the other candidates were militants of 
the other group. The two tried to attract votes to their lists, 
including those allegedly "without any leanings," which means 
they were undecided. They also tried to obtain support by 
including candidates in exchange for mutual support. 
  This way of making up the lists led some to rebel, or at 
least that was the case with the Democratic Left. During the 
period for registering nominations for the National Directorate 
(DN), Bayardo Altamirano registered independently. He later 
refused to decline in favor of Damaso Vargas, even after the 
names of the Sandinist Assembly were announced. 
  That is why there were 16 leftist candidates on the ballot. 
  There was basic agreement on line of thought and on the 
lists 
presented by the two tendencies. But the voters gave themselves 
some leeway, which led to some surprises in the final results. 
This explains why neither list managed to overshadow the other. 
Of the total 113 members elected to the Sandinist Assembly, 45 
were from the national roster, of which 26 were on the 
Democratic Left list and 17 were on the Majority Current list. 
Meanwhile, two names were on both lists: Francisco Rivera and 
Lucio Jimenez, who is considered an "orthodox," but is known to 
lean toward the Majority. 
  There were 41 lists, of the total 68 departmental lists, 
registered by Democratic Left and 27 by the Majority. 
  Of the 15 members of the DN, 10 were on the Democratic Left 
list and five were in the Majority. One of the 10 leftists was 
a declared Majority supporter. A second was Bayardo Arce, who 
took no sides until the last minute when he simply threw his 
support to Commander Daniel Ortega. 
  The two most outstanding surprises were those not elected to 
the DN: Sergio Ramirez, the main Majority leader, and Julio 
Lopez, who was not elected to the Sandinist Assembly. Everybody 
thought Lopez was the Democratic Left's ideologist and main 
leader. 
  Another indication that the election results were 
unpredictable is that out of the 113 members of the Sandinist 
Assembly elected, 22 won more than 300 votes, but only three are 
Democratic Left cadres: Daniel Ortega, Tomas Borge, and Lumberto 
Campbell. 
  In addition, 17 received less than 200 votes, and out of 
these 12 belong to the Democratic Left, including outstanding 
cadres such as Felix Contreras, Emmet Lang, and union leaders 
Mario Quintana, Gustavo Porras, and Damaso Vargas. In fact, 
three of their running mates made it through the women's quota: 
Ruth Herrera, Janeth Chavez, and Maria Esther Solis. It does 
not seem then that one list had the upper hand. 
  The congress was full of contrasts: The Majority current had 
as candidate Victor Manuel Gallegos (Pedrito el Hondureno), who 
certainly does not represent the "renewal" and "democratic" 
sector. 
  Another contrast was that during the heat of the debates, 
when the Sandinist Assembly was already elected and it seemed 
that the Democratic Left had "crushed" the Majority, a 
"negotiation" was suggested for the sake of unity to choose a 
"balanced Directorate." 
  Fernando Cardenal made the proposal public and official. In 
practice, this would have meant negotiating a single roster 
ballot. The proposal came from the Majority, whose members were 
the biggest critics of single roster ballots during the First 
Congress. 
  Confusion came out of the Congress. It is said that Mariano 
Fiallos was purged even though he was one of the candidates 
sought the most by both trends. The truth is that he declined 
both candidacies because of his work with the Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal. 
  Another contrasting fact is that the Democratic Left has on 
its list people like Lucio Jimenez and Sandra Ramos, among whom 
is not only a pending legal suit but a sharp political 
confrontation regarding the legitimacy of property claimed by 
the CST [Jose Benito Escobar Sandinist Workers Federation] from 
the Women's Secretariat. There was also Roberto Gonzalez who 
competed with Lucio Jimenez for the post of CST secretary 
general, which also added to the polarization felt in this 
Congress. 
  There was surprise at the election of barely known or 
unknown 
Miskito Thomas Tooker, from Rio Coco, who campaigned alone and 
managed, without being on any list, to obtain 180 votes to 
represent the RAAN [Northern Atlantic Autonomous Region].

  [Text] Political leaders Alfredo Cesar, Guillermo Potoy, 
and Luis Sanchez Sancho, yesterday disclosed during a news 
conference at the Intercontinental Hotel, the creation of a new 
political organization called the National Democratic Party 
(PND) [Partido Nacional Democrata]. 
  The PND came about after the Supreme Electoral Council 
issued 
a ruling in favor of the National Council of Political Parties' 
decision to recognize Adolfo Jarquin as the leader of the Social 
Democratic Party [PSD], thereby ratifying the ousting of Cesar 
and Potoy. Now there are 25 political parties in the nation. 
Cesar said that he, as well as a group of politicians who had 
belonged to other parties, were forced to create one more party 
given the political circumstances. "We had no other choice," he 
said. The PND defined itself as center-right although its 
leaders did not rule out that persons of social-democratic 
ideologies could join. 
  Former PSD president Guillermo Potoy described this party's 
past role during its 15 years of existence while he recalled 
that it never surrendered to Sandinist plans in the past decade. 
He added that for some years now an interest was perceived for 
the PSD to change its strategy of struggle and to assume an 
attitude of support and favor toward the current government. 
"This decision was strengthened with the help of government 
officials -- PSD members -- who for personal gain have dragged 
us to the current circumstances," Potoy noted. 
  Meanwhile, Sanchez Sancho said he was participating in the 
PND to contribute to the finding of political stability in the 
country. He said that after having actively participated in the 
left, he is convinced that this is not the ideological 
alternative for solving Nicaragua's problems. Sanchez Sancho 
said: "The left talks about progress and it generates 
backwardness. It talks about rivers of milk and honey that are 
of blood."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Carlos F. Chamorro B., director of BARRICADA] </F>
  [Text] Both before and after the FSLN's [Sandinist National 
Liberation Front] Special Congress took place, secret 
discussions on BARRICADA's future were held in political 
circles. It is wrongly believed that there is an automatic 
correlation between the results of that public event and the 
fate of the program already started by this newspaper. I think 
this is a mistaken premise and propose an alternative viewpoint 
to the reader. 
  BARRICADA was born as the official mouthpiece of a political 
party, the FSLN, and functioned as as partisan institution until 
January 1991. After that time, when the FSLN National 
Directorate approved its revamping, it became an autonomous 
journalistic institution with democratic principles, committed 
to serve professional journalism so as to strengthen its 
influence on and credibility with society. It autonomy as a 
newspaper company is regulated by its Board of Directors and 
Editorial Council. 
  All proposals for change, therefore, must proceed from the 
recognition that BARRICADA is not the extension of a partisan 
apparatus subject to redefinition along party line's but a 
newspaper that is becoming institutionalized and whose own 
dynamics constitute the main reference point for its strategy. 
  The newspaper that has promoted modernization of the press 
in 
Nicaragua is obligated to be in constant self-review in order to 
improve. It is not afraid of changes but rather promotes them, 
although it feels they must not be dictated behind the people's 
backs or exclude protagonists who make up the newspaper: its 
journalists, workers, assistants, etc. 
  An open, participatory, and public discussion of the 
contribution BARRICADA has been making to the overall 
democratization of our country is in order. Nicaraguan society 
as a whole, and not just one or another faction within the FSLN, 
has something to gain or lose, depending on the kind of changes 
that are introduced in this newspaper. 
  Based on experience, I am saying that the option to undo 
what 
has been done lacks all viability. Without meaning to exhaust 
the topic, for the time being I only want to focus on two points 
that are indispensable for BARRICADA's continued advance. 
  a) Sealing a commitment to the reader. 
  In jest and in earnest, I often tell the newspaper staff 
that 
our mission is to "not get on anyone's good side except the 
reader's." 
  That commitment to the reader, summarized in the rigorous 
effort to report the truth regardless of whether it helps or 
harms us politically, is the only thing that can ensure that 
BARRICADA will last as an long-term news instituiton. 
  A newspaper perceived as mirroring the interests of a 
pressure group or a faction within that group that establishes 
its agenda and the black holes of that agenda has no future in a 
democratic society, in a competitive system. It will never go 
beyond being a medium for the faithful. It may be formally 
combative but will have little effect in its mission of 
persuading others. 
  That is why we must stress with the quality of our daily 
work 
that our most important commitment -- I repeat, regardless of 
our preferences and interests -- is to the reader. It does not 
matter what pressures must be faced; we must defend the reader's 
right to be well-informed and hear independent opinions. 
  BARRICADA has made a lot of progress in this field. Its 
professional prestige and credibility constitute its greatest 
political asset. We are not subject to personal loyalties but 
to professional and ethical principles, and that should out of 
necessity draw us closer to the reader, producing journalism 
that does more good and service to the people each day. 
  b) National interests and democracy. 
  BARRICADA's basic commitment to the defense of national 
interests entails adopting a clear position in the face of 
reality, never a passive or neutral attitude. 
  That means placing on the national agenda serious problems 
like poverty, socioeconomic exclusion, ownership, and the safety 
of citizens, and taking sides in solving them from a standpoint 
that benefits the low-income majority and makes the viability of 
the country possible. 
  Real scrutiny of public and private powers demands good 
journalism that will marshal opinions and actions against public 
corruption and also oversee the proper functioning of private 
forces, political parties, unions, and social movements in line 
with the goals they have announced to society. Nobody should 
escape the scrutiny of the press. 
  Defending the common citizen and his individual rights is 
part of a crusade to give voice to those who have no other means 
of expressing themselves and does not grant concessions to the 
powerful and the state. Supporting just social and mass 
struggles is inherent to our principles. 
  The exercise of journalism from a democratic conviction 
entails as an obligation the promotion of a pluralist debate 
that helps eradicate the culture of violence and slurs. We 
cannnot fall prey to sectarian journalism. 
  To sow and practice dialogue, tolerance, and respect for the 
opinion of minorities constitutes one of the consubstantial 
values of democracy. But if we do not acknowledge the rise of 
new voices and social protagonists we will engender a debate 
limited to the elites. 
  In addition, we have an unequivocal commitment to face the 
lack of participation of this society without which 
representative democracy will always be ineffectual in finding a 
solution to the major national problems. 
  These are some of the current editorial challenges facing 
BARRICADA that may be summarized in a strong conviction: a 
profound transformation in the nation's political culture is 
imperative so that democracy can be truly irreversible.

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Quintero De Leon] </F>
  [Text] Gerardo Gonzalez, president of the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party, soon to be ruling party, has said that as 
long as the lines followed by the party's Political Committee 
and National Directorate remain unchanged, they will reject the 
amendments being suggested to the Constitution. 
  In 1992, the PRD spearheaded the group that foiled the 
government's hopes, and in particular the Christian Democratic 
Party's hopes, of approving amendments to the Constitution that 
included the elimination of the concept of an army and almost 
100 other changes. 
  Gonzalez said that those amendments to the Constitution were 
discussed months before the 1992 referendum and were rejected. 
Now, the Executive Branch is introducing amendments similar to 
those rejected in the referendum. "I personally reject what was 
already rejected, by vote, by our people," Gonzalez said. 
  When asked if his rejection contradicts what President-elect 
Ernesto Perez Balladares has said about these amendments, 
Gonzalez said that Perez' words have been misinterpreted. "It 
is one thing for the president-elect to say that he is 
interested in seeing the Constitution adjusted to eliminate all 
reference to the National Guard (Army) and create a law for the 
National Police (thus solving the lack of protection experienced 
by our people) and another to put something over on someone 
[meter gato por liebre] leaving this country a colony," Gonzalez 
added. 
  According to the PRD president, what is sought is to 
eliminate from the Constitution the duties that the members of 
the Public Force have and the duty of the Panamanian citizens to 
defend their country, including the protection of the Canal as 
well as our borders. Gonzalez explained that if an 
international incident should occur along our borders, incidents 
that could involve unconventional forces, the policemen would 
not be obligated to take action because their duty is restricted 
to maintaining public order. "The constitutional reform is clear 
in stating that the police will have Dobermans [former Panama 
Defense Force riot squad] to repress demonstrations and units to 
capture thieves and investigate crimes, and that is it." 
  In light of a suggestion presented by Legislator Milton 
Henriquez to form a Constituent Assembly that will completely 
change the Constitution, Gonzalez said "those defeated Christian 
Democrats are always setting little traps for the future," 
because a Constituent Assembly would solve nothing. Following 
the idea of a Constituent Assembly, Gonzalez said that a 
solution to the problem would be to give the next Legislative 
Assembly a six-month period, or as long as it needs, to act as a 
Constituent Assembly and make the necessary changes to the 
Constitution, changes that all the political forces will have 
agreed on.

  [Text] Banking confidentiality in Panama "should be 
redefined" to avoid the legitimate right to privacy from being 
used as a means to protect the laundering of money resulting 
from drug trafficking, Olegario Barrelier, president of the 
Panamanian Banking Association, has told LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA. 
  "As part of the services banks offer to honest local and 
foreign customers, banking confidentiality should be redefined 
in explaining the rights banks, their employees, former 
employees, the National Banking Commission, and other 
authorities should have," Barrelier has said. He has said the 
National Banking Association will present specific proposals to 
the national government "when appropriate." 
  According to Barrelier, total banking secrecy in Panama, as 
in other countries, "does not exist." The banker has said: "We 
would rather say there is banking confidentiality," and he has 
said the legal provision on this issue "is a part of the 
legitimate right to privacy an individual has regarding his 
home, mail, telephone communications, assets, and businesses." 
  According to Barrelier, the proposals at the international 
level, particularly those coming from the United States, 
advocating a limitation on banking secrecy in nations "attempt 
to avoid" individuals or companies linked to drug trafficking 
that use banking services "to camouflage," through banking 
confidentiality, the illegal nature of their revenues. 
  Although the Panamanian Government has taken significant 
measures to avoid the dishonest use of banking services, the 
Panamanian Banking Association "has a great willingness to 
continue cooperating in the struggle against money laundering," 
Barrelier has said.

  [Text] Education Minister Marco Alarcon confirmed yesterday 
he will resign from his post to avail himself of his retirement 
as a teacher. He also said German Vergara, current Arnulfist 
Party [PA] deputy secretary general, will replace him. 
  Alarcon's resignation will be effective as of 1 July, when 
his retirement papers, currently in their final processing 
stage, are completed. It was also reported that Alarcon 
requested his vacation time, as is his right, after having been 
the education minister for three [number as published] years. 
  He took office on 1 April 1992, when he replaced Ada de 
Gordon, following President Guillermo Endara's ousting of the 
Christian Democratic Party from the government alliance. 
Alarcon denied that his separation from the post of education 
minister is due to discrepancies with the PA or with President 
Endara. 
  Meanwhile, Vergara said he accepted the appointment to the 
post. The current minister recommended him, and Endara accepted 
the recommendation. Vergara was the secretary general of the 
Health Ministry, and he acquired his teaching experience in the 
interior. 
  PA Secretary General Carlos Young Adames highly praised 
Vergara's appointment by noting he believes in the work Vergara 
will embark on despite the short term he will have heading the 
Education Ministry. 
  It was also confirmed that Bolivar Armuelles will remain 
deputy education minister until 1 September, when the government 
of President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares begins.

<F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega; from the "RPC Television News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] President Guillermo Endara Galimany has said the 
management changes at the Interoceanic Region Authority [ARI] 
will not affect the plans of that institution. 
  For Endara, Juan Blau's resignation from the post of ARI 
administrator will not cause a crisis in that institution. 
  [Begin Endara recording] You must remember the post of 
manager is not important in the ARI. What is important are the 
directors. The manager is an official who can be changed without 
a problem. [end recording] 
  Endara has said the ARI's priority is devising an action 
master plan for the use of the reverted areas. The president of 
the Republic has also commented on the structuring of a 
constituent assembly. 
  [Begin Endara recording] Henriquez' [not further identified] 
formula is to leave the door open so that in the future, when 
one wants to convene a Constituent Assembly, the future 
executive and legislative branches could use a special mechanism 
to do so without violating the Constitution; this is a great 
idea that I support. I did not present it, because I did not 
achieve a consensus among the parties that supported me back 
then. [end recording] 
  Endara has also said his administration does not want to 
create crises in government institutions to adversely affect the 
future administration of Perez Balladares. He has also ruled 
out irregular situations in the Social Security Fund. 
  [Begin Endara recording] During the coming weeks of my 
administration, three months, there will be many rumors and 
speculation. We are interested--this is very clear--in handing 
power over to those elected whom the people elected under the 
best possible conditions. [end recording] 
  The president explained he will not adopt important 
decisions 
during the remaining months of his administration. He concluded 
he will continue to carry out works and administer the 
government properly.

<F P=106> [Report by Esperanza Navarro Francois] </F>
  [Text] The Coalition of Panama Canal Commission's Labor 
Unions, AFL-CIO, yesterday rejected an amendment proposal 
presented to the U.S. Congress by President Bill Clinton to 
regulate Panama Canal operations administratively and 
financially, because they believe the proposal "threatens" 
worker interests. 
  According to Commission workers, the proposal gives absolute 
and total power to the Panama Canal Board of Directors by giving 
the Board authority to determine which federal standards will 
remain in effect for the Canal Commission during the transition 
period. 
  According to Commission workers, the proposal presented by 
the Panama Canal Board of Directors, based on a study and 
recommendations by the firm Arthur Anderson, "will create 
uncertainty and nervousness." The workers are afraid they will 
lose the rights they have attained with so much effort and 
sacrifice. 
  In a communique sent to the workers, the Coalition has 
alerted international organizations in the United States to 
ensure their participation in the congressional debates.

amendments to the law that regulates the Panama Canal, which 
were proposed by President Bill Clinton. 
  In a communique, the association of PCC workers signals that 
it has put on alert all its international labor union 
representatives in the United States to guarantee their 
participation in the debates that will take place in Congress 
regarding the proposal to modify the law that regulates the 
interoceanic waterway. 
  President Bill Clinton sent to the U.S. Congress a series of 
recommendations on changes to the law that regulates the Panama 
Canal regarding administrative and financial concerns. The goal 
is to allow a more efficient and harmonious transfer of the 
interoceanic waterway on 31 December 1999, as provided for in 
the treaties signed in 1977. 
  The communique adds that the unions that represent PCC 
workers were not consulted nor was their opinion requested with 
regard to the modification proposals.

  [Text] A source of the Judicial Technical Police (PTJ) told 
EL PANAMA AMERICA yesterday that due to lack of evidence the 
Assistant Prosecutor's Office issued a precautionary measure 
[medida cautelar] in favor of the two Colombians arrested 
Thursday on suspicion of having participated in the attack on 
Jewish businessman Aaron Schwartz. 
  According to the source, after the situation of the 
Colombians was studied, they were freed because there was not 
enough evidence against them. Nevertheless, the two Colombians, 
whose names we omit because of the principle of presumption of 
innocence, are prohibited from leaving the country. These 
individuals told the Assistant Prosecutor's Office they were in 
Panama to buy automobiles. 
  On Thursday, the vehicle Schwartz was driving exploded and 
burned on Via Italia in the Paitilla neighborhood as a result of 
the explosion of a grenade connected to the front wheels of the 
vehicle. Schwartz suffered minor injuries to his arms and feet. 
  The Colombians were linked to the attack after an anonymous 
call reported their alleged participation in the incident. 
According to the source, the investigations have taken a new 
turn after data was gathered on the professionalism needed to 
place the grenade and the high cost of this type of work.

  [Excerpts] On 5 June Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella will 
meet with Strobe Talbott, second in importance at the State 
Department, to discuss the situation in Haiti. The meeting will 
take place during a break in the OAS deliberations in Belem, 
Brazil. 
  Foreign Ministry sources told CLARIN that Di Tella wants to 
discuss the scope of Argentina's participation in a multilateral 
military intervention force aimed at reestablishing democracy in 
Haiti, in case last week's UN resolution ordering a total naval 
blockade of the country fails. [passage omitted] 
  Apparently Di Tella would be consulted about a U.S. idea to 
create a police or military force with personnel from the entire 
continent for that eventuality. Di Tella will possibly tell 
Talbott whether Argentina is willing to send troops to 
participate in that force. Di Tella has already told CLARIN 
that the idea has the government's political support.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 31 May (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
announced this morning that Radical Civic Union leader Raul 
Alfonsin "last night denied" establishing a "pact" with Grand 
Front leader Carlos Chacho Alvarez to prevent the Justicialist 
Party from including a clause [in the constitutional reform] to 
allow the reelection of governors. 
  Menem told Radio 9.90: "We have only one pact here -- the 
Olivos Pact," which Menem signed with Alfonsin. 
  The chief of state did not hide his disquiet about some 
headlines in Buenos Aires newspapers which report an alleged 
"pact" between Alfonsin and Alvarez, or on the comparison he 
made between Argentina and Colombia [regarding the World Soccer 
Cup].

<F P=106> [Interview with Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo by </F>
unidentified ESTRATEGIA reporter in Santiago, Chile; date not 
given] 
  [Text] [ESTRATEGIA] Several months after achieving the 
economic goals -- the curbing of the inflation rate and high 
economic growth -- established by the Menem administration, what 
problems still affect the Argentine economy? 
  [Cavallo] Of all of the strictly economic problems affecting 
our economy only those of the agricultural sector, prompted by 
low international prices, and some regional economies, mainly 
conducted by provincial governments, are worth mentioning. 
Nevertheless, we face a great challenge in social services 
areas such as education, health, justice and social security. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] What about the high unemployment rate, which is 
about 10 percent, and the commercial deficit, which increased by 
800 percent in the first two months of the year? 
  [Cavallo] Our economy has been creating new jobs and 
increasing the labor rate at 2 percent per year, which is not 
bad for a country with an annual population growth of 1.3 
percent per year. Despite this increase of jobs in 1993, the 
unemployment level increased because many women and immigrants 
have joined the labor force. Additionally, we had the paradox 
that the labor force increased by 5 percent between 1992 and 
1993. Although this is a negative indicator, we believe it is 
also an opportunity to quickly increase our economic growth 
because Argentina may witness a sharp increase in the 
construction industry, which will absorb quite a lot of the 
currently idle labor. As is well-known in Chile, the key to 
reactivation of the construction area lies in an increase in 
medium and long-term savings levels. This year we are about to 
implement in Argentina a social security reform which will 
promote such savings. We hope the reactivation of the 
construction industry will create enough jobs to return 
unemployment to its normal levels. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] How about the commercial deficit? 
  [Cavallo] We experienced an increase of capital goods 
imports 
in Argentina because a large part of investments were used to 
purchase foreign-manufactured equipment, which I believe is very 
healthy for our economy. In addition, the commercial balance 
deficit is accompanied by an important surplus in capital in the 
balance of payments. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] When will you implement a devaluation 
  [Cavallo] Never! (adamant). Why should we devalue if we 
have a monetary system that has allowed us to achieve 
unprecedented stability in Latin America. Argentina has 
achieved a 3 percent annual inflation rate, and we have done so 
on the basis of a monetary system of which we are proud. We do 
not believe we need to devalue in order to promote exports. We 
believe production costs must decrease and that we must 
streamline and eliminate distorting taxes. In Argentina's case, 
a devaluation will not help exports. 
  It is not mandatory to use a national currency in the 
Argentine economy nor are there any fixed prices in national 
currency. Any currency can be used in our economic system and 
in many cases prices are fixed in dollars. To change the value 
of the Argentine peso in relation to the dollar would only cause 
instability at the macroeconomic level and would not improve the 
level of Argentine exports. No one considers the government 
will devalue the peso in Argentina anymore. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Let me change the question. Under what 
circumstances would you consider devaluation? 
  [Cavallo] Under no circumstances because it does not make 
any 
sense. (In a categorical and irritated tone) 
  Nobody is thinking of devaluation in Argentina. Only abroad, 
where people without understanding of our exchange system apply 
their own economic reasoning and think of devaluation. In my 
country nobody thinks of devaluation. This is shown by the 
parity between interest rates in pesos and dollars, which are 
nearly identical. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] What will happen to exporters who complain 
about 
their loss of competitiveness? 
  [Cavallo] We have a traditional agricultural and cattle 
exporting sector that is currently suffering low international 
prices. Our industries have always concentrated on the domestic 
market, producing low quality products using specifications and 
designs that are inappropriate for the international market; so 
we are currently investing in our productive capacity which must 
be better prepared to produce goods and services like those 
demanded abroad, and we are attaining this. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] What economic results do you expect for 1994? 
  [Cavallo] We expect 3 percent annual inflation, measured by 
the cost of living index, and about a 6 percent growth of the 
GDP. We expect our exports to increase by 10 percent and 
investments to increase by 12 percent. We expect an increase in 
the internal savings rate which already climbed from 14.3 
percent to 16.7 percent. This year we expect to increase 
savings by something between 1 and 1.5 percent of the GDP. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] How did the increase in U.S. interest rates 
affect the Argentine economy, especially the stock exchange and 
foreign investments? 
  [Cavallo] It lowered the value of the private and public 
foreign debt long-term bonds, just like in other developing 
countries. In the past few weeks, however, these bonds began to 
recover their value. The same happened in the stock exchange: 
It was bearish at the beginning but has been recovering lately. 
We managed to launch shares in the Transportadora Gas del Sur 
company at a time when public share offers from other countries 
had to withdrawn from the market. We managed to sell all the 
shares we placed on the market at a price within what was 
expected. Shares from Argentine companies have been received 
well abroad. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] What reforms do you intend to implement to 
further modernize Argentine economy? 
  [Cavallo] Well, we still have the whole privatization and 
deregulation process. The fact that capital goods imports are 
not taxed will help increase investments, especially productive 
investments. We are attaining impressive results in the field 
of increased productivity. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] It is said that because of next year's 
elections, the government of Carlos Menem has programmed greater 
public spending to calm social demands. What effect will that 
program have on the current economic goals? 
  [Cavallo] President Menem has announced the enlargement of 
the public works program for the interior of the country but 
this will be done with savings on routine federal government 
spending. The level of public spending approved by the 1994 
Budget Law is maintained. The public spending in Argentina is 
$49 billion and the additional public works program is $300 
million. The additional public works program is being financed 
from savings on routine federal government spending. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Are the social disturbances a threat for the 
Argentine political and economic stability? 
  [Cavallo] No. I would just say that Argentina had very few 
social conflicts over the last five years. Some of the 
disturbances, like the one in Santiago del Estero, were caused 
by the corruption and inefficiency of local officials who 
irritated the people. When a member of the economic team became 
the federal interventor and put order into that province, we 
went from losing the 3-October elections to overwhelmingly 
winning the 10-April elections. It is clear the disturbance was 
not a reaction to the social costs created by the economic 
adjustment but a popular reaction against the corruption and 
inefficiency of local officials who used obsolete political ways 
which the people no longer want. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] The resurgence of the left in the April 
elections was interpreted in some circles as punishment for the 
government as a result of the political and social cost of the 
Convertibility Plan. What is your opinion? 
  [Cavallo] There is no indication that the emergence of the 
left was related to the political and social costs of the 
Convertibility Plan. The left was positive toward the economic 
reform and centered its electoral campaign against corruption. 
I believe the left received votes from other parties in the 
April elections. It received the support from people who were 
against the agreement between President Menem and ex-President 
Raul Alfonsin. When it comes to electing a government in 
Argentina, the votes from the Radical Civic Union and other 
political sectors that went to the left will return to their 
parties. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] People are already beginning to talk about the 
second phase of the Convertibility Plan in your country. What 
are the measures of that phase? 
  [Cavallo] As part of the Argentine economic reform plan, we 
are now progressing on issues like health, education, justice, 
security, labor, culture, and especially in the reform of the 
provincial and municipal public sector. These are phases of the 
same economic plan which must gradually cover a diversified 
group of economic and social activities, and which must be 
extended to all government levels. This is nothing new, it is 
the same plan extending its geographic area and institutional 
coverage. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] What is happening to the project to save 
private 
companies? Is there such a thing as future statization? 
  [Cavallo] No. We have a very bad bankruptcy law because when 
a company fails, all the assets, know-how [preceding word in 
English], patents, and human resources are lost because the 
judges take years to sell the assets and this makes the 
continuity of those companies impossible. We have established 
an out-of-court system in cases if the state, through the 
internal revenue organizations or official banks, is an 
important creditor of a company. So, instead of sending it into 
bankruptcy, the company assets are sold in a more expeditious 
manner. This is how we hope to keep companies which, except for 
financial problems, are healthy. Like this they can recover, 
totally or partially, their credit balance. We are doing that 
because we have great experience in privatizing companies. I 
call this the privatization of private companies because they 
are companies that accumulated large debts with the state and 
are thus virtually state companies because their main creditor 
is the state. They will be privatized like this. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] What is happening regarding taxes in Argentina? 
It has been announced that taxes on real estate will be 
increased. 
  [Cavallo] We are lowering taxes. You are referring to a 
direct tax on real estate in some of the wealthiest districts of 
the federal capital, but the municipal councils will have to 
decide that. This has nothing to do with a tax increase that 
makes production costs more expensive. On this issue, we are 
reducing taxes like those affecting salaries -- the so-called 
employer's contributions. We are also eliminating taxes on 
provincial gross incomes, which affect production costs, 
financial transfer costs, and contracts. We also have a policy 
for eliminating taxes that distort. Of course, we continue to 
adjust the mechanisms for tax collection to prevent evasion. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] In face of the resurgence of the left, and of 
the discontent among Argentine people because of unemployment 
and corruption, will Menem be reelected? 
  [Cavallo] I believe President Menem is leading a great 
process of economic transformation in Argentina, within the 
context of the full functioning of democratic institutions. The 
perception is that the public supported and continues to support 
this transformation. I believe there is a great chance of his 
being reelected in 1995. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] You also have great popular support. What post 
would you select in the new government: minister of health, 
Cordoba governor, vice president, or economy minister? 
  [Cavallo] (he laughs) I will, most probably, continue as 
economy minister. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Do you consider yourself Menem's political 
heir? 
  [Cavallo] (laughing more heartily) No, no way. I am just the 
economy minister. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] But you are perhaps the most popular minister. 
  [Cavallo] I am a minister who is supported by the people, 
but 
in my capacity as economy minister. The Argentine people 
normally regard me as their economy minister, nothing else. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Corruption is a problem that is currently 
affecting many countries. What is Argentina doing in this 
respect? 
  [Cavallo] Well, for the time being we are promoting economic 
reforms that will result in the removal of opportunities for 
corruption. Privatizations, deregulation, and the economic 
stability we are promoting are causing public decisions to come 
under the people's scrutiny, and are thus reducing the chances 
of corruption. There are, however, public and private areas 
where there are still opportunities for corruption, where there 
are both people willing to corrupt and those willing to be 
corrupted. These actions fall within the jurisdiction of the 
courts, and we in the executive branch are working -- each 
within his area of responsibility -- to identify and remove 
corrupt officials. The fact that the newspapers are carrying 
frequent reports on corruption cases testifies to the openness 
promoted by the Argentine political and economic system. We 
should take corruption charges as a positive sign, as evidence 
of a political and economic openness that will allow us to 
eradicate this scourge. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] What advantages does Argentina offer to foreign 
investors, namely Chilean investors? 
  [Cavallo] Chileans can use their know-how and the experience 
they have acquired in their process of privatization and 
increased production. They could also make very good profits by 
investing in Argentina precisely because the Argentine process 
of privatization and transformation of public companies is very 
similar to that of Chile. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] In which areas of the Argentine economy could 
new Chilean investments be made? 
  [Cavallo] In everything concerning energy, oil, gas, 
electricity, and related services, because these can also be 
exported to Chile. Investments could be made in everything 
related to agro-industries, lumber, cellulose, paper, and 
especially in the mining area. This because Chile has wide 
experience in mining, and we could engage in joint undertakings 
because our mining resources are located near the Chilean border. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] If the award in the case of Laguna del 
Desierto is unfavorable to Argentina, how would this affect 
trade between Chile and Argentina? 
  [Cavallo] That subject falls within the jurisdiction of the 
Foreign Ministry, and only Foreign Minister Di Tella or 
President Menem may comment on it. Besides, I never like to 
answer speculative questions. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] What would be your evaluation of our bilateral 
relations? 
  [Cavallo] Our bilateral trade has increased. We have agreed 
to open mountain passes, and are conducting joint feasibility 
studies to build new infrastructural facilities to deepen our 
integration. Argentina wants to move toward promoting mutual use 
of our port facilities. Additionally, conditions for 
investments in the two countries can be improved through the 
signing of a mutual investment protection treaty. We are also 
improving our tariff structure. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Do you believe Argentina stands a good chance 
of 
joining NAFTA sooner than Chile? 
  [Cavallo] No, I don't. Chile is closer to joining NAFTA than 
Argentina. Besides, my country has not yet discussed the 
possibility of joining NAFTA. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Would you be in favor of or against Chile 
joining Mercosur [Common Market of the South]? 
  [Cavallo] I am in favor of negotiations to promote free 
trade 
between Chile and Mercosur. I would, of course, like it if 
Chile joined Mercosur. I realize, however, that this would not 
be realistic, as it would bring uncertainty into the Chilean 
tariff policy, an area in which your country has had much 
success. To do this would not make sense. It would be most 
practical and beneficial to everyone if we, the four Mercosur 
member countries on the one hand, and Chile on the other started 
a free trade agreement. 
  Yet we consider it desirable and possible for Mercosur and 
Chile to start negotiations to create a free trade area. In 
this respect, Chile could join the Mercosur member countries, in 
what will be our goal during the first stage of the treaty -- 
that is, the free circulation of goods and services between our 
nations without any type of tariff or similar restrictions. 
  I think Mercosur is going to progress well. First there will 
be a free trade area formed by the four Mercosur member 
countries, and a while later we will agree on a common external 
tariff that will make us function as a customs union. 
Meanwhile, we are making progress in coordinating our economic 
policies, and it is our objective to succeed in creating a true 
common market.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry has reported that Argentina and 
the United Kingdom simultaneously agreed to ban, as of 1 June, 
the fishing of Illex squid south of parallel 43 in the South 
Atlantic in an effort to preserve the species. 
  The measure was adopted by the Agriculture, Livestock, and 
Fishing Secretariat based on recent studies by the National 
Institute for Fishing Development and Research (Inipep), with 
the approval of the British Government. 
  An analysis of Illex squid levels below latitude 43 degrees 
30 minutes south emphasized the "suitability" of "preventive 
measures" to "maintain and preserve" the species. 
  The secretariat also decided "to ban for a reasonable time" 
the fishing of Illex Argentinius "south of parallel 43 as of 1 
June" to preserve "sustainable levels." 
  The resolution will apply to "all Argentine and 
foreign-flagged ships" legally authorized to fish in Argentine 
waters. It adds that "the Argentine Navy will strictly observe 
the situation" to prevent violations. 
  High-ranking British Government officials told the Argentine 
Foreign Ministry of their decision to adopt "similar measures," 
also as of 1 June, once Argentina's resolution banning the 
fishing of squid was announced. 
  Diplomatic sources indicated that the British measure is 
based on a 1990 joint Argentine-British declaration on the 
preservation of fishing resources ratified in November 1993. 
  The Argentine-British coincidence to ban the fishing of 
Illex 
squid comes just a few days before the eighth meeting of the 
Bilateral Commission on South Atlantic Fishing in London on 6 
and 7 June.

<F P=106> [Report by Miguel Angel Rouco] </F>
  [Text] Argentina will reject the Paraguayan request for 
additional financial compensation to pay for damage caused by 
the filling of the Yacyreta dam. A similar position will be 
assumed with respect to the Uruguayan Government request that 
Argentina assume a greater portion of the cost for construction 
of the Martin Garcia channel project. 
  The government made this decision following a meeting 
between 
Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo and Foreign Minister Guido Di 
Tella. 
  During the meeting both ministers established the groundwork 
for future negotiations with both countries to prevent further 
economic damage against Argentina. 
  A spokesman said: "Negotiations will be difficult, 
particularly considering the construction schedule for both 
public works." 
  This schedule provides for the Argentine-Paraguayan 
hydroelectric power plant to start operating on 1 September. 
Ten days ago Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy warned 
that the filling of the dam reservoir would be delayed until the 
issue of expropriations and the relocation of people living on 
the Paraguayan side are resolved. The area scheduled to be 
flooded on the Paraguayan side involves some 40,000 hectares of 
poor land, but with some settlements. 
  According to the Argentine Foreign Ministry, the problem 
must 
be resolved by the Yacyreta Binational Entity (EBY), which must 
provide more funds to compensate Paraguayan settlers. "Those 
lands are probably owned by people close to the Paraguayan 
Government, and not by simple settlers. This is probably why 
there is so much interest in Asuncion in modifying the mechanism 
for compensation." 
  On the other front, Uruguay wants Argentina to pay 
two-thirds 
of the total cost of the Martin Garcia Channel dredging, 
maintenance, and sign posting, while Uruguay pays the remaining 
one-third. 
  "This demand is inadmissible, because both countries will 
benefit equally from the project. The decision to navigate 
through the Emilio Mitre Channel or the Martin Garcia Channel is 
one of cost. Surely those using the Martin Garcia Channel will 
dock at Uruguayan ports. In the end the benefit will be for 
both countries, and thus our position is that each country must 
pay half of the total cost," Transport Secretary Edmundo Soria 
said. 
  The dredging of the Martin Garcia Channel will have an 
initial cost of more than $100 million. The channel will permit 
the passage of ships having up to 32 feet in draught, which 
means that ocean ships will be able to enter the channel. 
Maintaining the channel will cost some $25 million annually.

  [Text] National Police Commander General Luis Rocha said 
yesterday that his institution supports the military patrols 
being carried out in the Chapare region since early this week in 
accordance with constitutional regulations. 
  Rocha said: "The Armed Forces belong to the nation, and they 
have the constitutional right to be wherever they want to be in 
accordance with their needs." 
  He said, however, that this does not mean that the Special 
Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) is not capable to keeping order in 
the conflictive region of Chapare, in Cochabamba Department. 
  Asked about the alleged formation of irregular groups 
financed by drug trafficking, General Rocha said that the police 
intelligence services have not confirmed their presence, but 
that the situation is being investigated because of the latent 
threat of criminal groups linked to drug trafficking. 
  He also indicated that the investigation is being carried 
out 
jointly with Army intelligence. Answering reporters, Rocha 
said: "All the actions are of course being coordinated with the 
Armed Forces." 
  He added that the current situation does not demand an 
increase in the FELCN presence in the Chapare. On the contrary, 
he said, there are enough agents there to maintain control over 
any possible conflict.

  [Text] According to Minister of Government German Quiroga, 
coca growers are using the industrialization of the coca leaf as 
a pretext for freely marketing this product, in many cases with 
illegal purposes. 
  The coca growers reject the [industrialization] decree 
because it not only restricts the industrialization of coca leaf 
in traditional zones -- that is, in Yungas in La Paz -- but also 
because Article No. 2 states ambiguously that coca leaf is 
penalized in Bolivia. 
  Minister Quiroga asserts that the article is not ambiguous. 
  [Begin Quiroga recording] Coca leaf is penalized by Law No. 
1008. [end recording] 
  According to Law No. 1008 the production of coca leaf is 
penalized. According to Article No. 8 of this law, there are 
three regions: The Yungas zone in La Paz is the traditional 
production zone; the Chapare zone in Cochabamba is the 
transition surplus production zone; and the illegal production 
zone entails the whole of Bolivian territory with the exception 
of the two aforementioned zones. 
  [Begin Quiroga recording] There are coca growers who want to 
be completely free to transport it from one place to another, to 
transfer it under the pretext of industrializing it. I told the 
coca growers that if we are successful with the regulation for 
industrialization in the Yungas zone, and if we run short of raw 
materials, then we would take the next step, and immediately 
authorize its industrialization in Chapare. But they do not 
accept this, they want everything. [end recording] 
  The coca growers have announced pressure measures if the 
government does not modify the decree after the COB [Bolivian 
Labor Federation] congress. 
  The government has asserted that there is nothing to modify, 
as this legal tool is the result of consensus and coinciding 
points of view.

  [Excerpt] The Senate has suspended the impeachment of 
[Supreme Court Justices] Edgar Oblitas and Ernesto Pope. 
  Senate President Juan Carlos Duran has stated that the 
impeachment was suspended in compliance with a decision by the 
Congress stating that the two houses cannot work separately. A 
few days ago the Chamber of Deputies declared a recess until 6 
June, and the Senate had to follow suit and thus suspend the 
impeachment process. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Upon ending his official visit to the country, 
Bertrand Dufourcq, French vice foreign minister [title as 
published], said last night that relations and the financial, 
scientific, and cultural cooperation with Bolivia are positive 
and on the right path. 
  Within that framework, Dufourcq said that agreements and 
protocols for financial aid in various fields were also signed. 
  Dufourcq said that his country "would be very pleased to 
support the Bolivian request to negotiate its foreign debt 
before the Paris Club," as France presides over this financial 
organization. 
  He also noted that annual French aid to Bolivia amounts to 
approximately $30 million, in addition to indirect help in the 
form of the $8 million France contributes to the European Union 
for aid. 
  Dufourcq indicated that Bolivian officials asked for greater 
French aid in some sectors, and specifically in the civil 
service program for training state employees. 
  Regarding the financial protocols, the agreement that was 
signed involves 45 million French francs for the Cochabamba 
water system. 
  France will also support the construction of a cable railway 
from La Paz to El Alto, and will donate 5 million francs for an 
aeronautics plan. In addition $50,000 will be appropriated for 
the purchase of medicine to fight leishmaniasis. 
  Dufourcq also said: "France is willing to negotiate new 
agreements with Bolivia." 
  Dufourcq also signed two agreements with the Bolivian 
Government. One is a cooperation agreement with the National 
Police, which will receive technical equipment and a computer 
system. The other agreement refers to the cultural and 
scientific area, by which French experts and scientists will 
provide their know-how for the development of Bolivia.

  [Text] Vector transmitted diseases cover more than 
two-thirds of the nation's territory with their threatening 
presence, and most of the population is exposed to contagion. 
  Malaria, yaws, yellow fever, hemorrhagic fever, dengue, 
typhus, bubonic plague, and leishmaniasis cast shadows over 75 
percent of Bolivia's territory and constitute a public health 
problem because of their magnitude. 
<H5>  Malaria: The Bites of the Anopheles </H5>
  The population of the area affected by malaria, the tropical 
disease caused by the bite of the anopheles mosquito, is 2.7 
million, and there has been an increase recently in the number 
afflicted due principally to a halt in fumigation. 
  There were 25,364 cases reported in 1989, 19,031 in 1991, 
24,486 in 1992, and 12,000 in 1993. 
  The risk of contracting malaria is greatest in the district 
of Guayaramerin, where the incidence is 215 cases per 1,000 
inhabitants. Here 42 percent of the known cases are due to the 
presence in that area of an ideal center of larval incubation. 
  Incidence in Pando is 42 per 1,000 inhabitants, and in 
Chuquisaca 10 per 1,000. The endemic zone in that department is 
located in Hernando Siles and Luis Calvo Provinces. The 
incidence of cases in Cochabamba is three per 1,000, in La Paz 
four per 1,000, and in Santa Cruz seven per 1,000. In the 
Provinces of Gran Chaco, Arce, and O'Connor in the department of 
Tarija, the tendency is toward stability at a high level: 30 per 
1,000 inhabitants. 
  The fight against malaria does not seem to be very 
successful. In Pando recently, health authorities admitted that 
200 persons had died, and the church has denounced the lack of 
attention to the problem by national health officials. 
<H5>  Yaws, a Legacy of Bugs and Poverty </H5>
  There are two determining causes of the disease of yaws: the 
presence of the transmitting vector, which determines the 
endemic area, and the severe poverty in which the populace 
lives. This is an area which covers six departments and 25 
provinces where more than a million persons live. 
  A program has been started to improve the precarious 
dwellings of mud and adobe, typical of the area. In the cracks 
of these huts the bugs are able to hide and find shelter from 
insecticides. 
  According to estimates of the National Secretariat of 
Health, 
there are 562,000 dwellings where bugs are almost always 
present, and 90 percent of these bugs carry the microorganism 
that causes the disease. 
<H5>  Human and Canine Rabies </H5>
  Official figures indicate that there were only 32 cases of 
canine rabies during the first two months of 1994, while during 
the same period of 1993 there were 131 cases of canine rabies, 
four in felines, one in sheep, and three cases of human rabies. 
  There is one dog for every 10 persons in Bolivia; there are 
700,000 of these animals, considered by man to be one of his 
best friends. The incidence of canine rabies is 19 per 1,000 
dogs. 
  The incidence of human rabies is .39 per 1,000 inhabitants. 
Its presence is slight but lethal. Several years ago, Bolivia 
pledged to eradicate rabies completely from its nine major 
cities by 1990, a commitment that was not met due to the 
impossibility of obtaining the vaccine or the funds to acquire 
it. 
<H5>  Hemorrhagic Fever </H5>
  This disease, which causes the patient's death in a few 
hours 
due to massive hemorrhaging of the conjunctive tissues and of 
the oral mucous membranes, profuse nasal hemorrhaging, and even 
hemorrhaging through the skin, first appeared in 1959. The 
endemic area is entirely within the department of Pando. 
  The pathogenic agent is the Machupo virus, carried by the 
callomis callosus rat. 
  Until 1975, sporadic outbreaks occurred that were 
characterized by a high degree of mortality. 
  No cases were reported between 1976 and 1992. Recently, a 
reported new outbreak of five cases sounded the alarm for the 
population of Pando, but so far the analyses do not show that 
this dangerous disease is involved. 
  The disease is endemic in areas bordering the Machupo and 
Negro Rivers, and in areas adjacent to the settlements of San 
Ramon and San Joaquin, where an ecological imbalance has 
occurred due to excessive hunting of felines, which has 
permitted the rodents to multiply. 
<H5>  Leishmaniasis, 1 Million Persons Within Its Reach </H5>
  This disease is endemic to the tropical and subtropical 
zones 
of La Paz, Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, and Pando, and it infects 
4,500 persons, according to the latest statistics of the 
Directorate of Epidemiology. 
  Almost a million persons run the risk of contracting this 
illness, a deforming disease similar to leprosy that destroys 
the sufferer's face. 
  The disease is caused by the bite of a mosquito, a 
blood-sucker of limited flying range that lives in tree tops in 
mountainous areas. The disease manifests itself in deformities 
of the nasal and oral mucous membranes and of the ear lobe. 
  The bite causes a characteristic spot with an ulceration 
that 
often heals by itself, or else continues to ulcerate. This is 
the first symptom of leishmaniasis, and its timely detection can 
help to avoid deformities. 
<H5>  Yellow Fever </H5>
  The area endemic to yellow fever includes the country's 
entire eastern region, Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando, Chuquisaca, 
Tarija, Cochabamba, and La Paz. It covers an area of 400,000 
square kilometers, 36 percent of the national area with 1.2 
million inhabitants. 
  In 1992, there were 22 cases with 18 deaths reported. 
<H5>  Typhus </H5>
  This disease is endemic to areas in the departments of La 
Paz, Potosi, and Cochabamba. In 1991, 34 cases were reported in 
the Province of Mizque (Cochabamba), and one in 1992. No cases 
have been reported since then. 
<H5>  Bubonic Plague </H5>
  Bubonic plague has occurred in recent years only in Franz 
Tamayo Province (La Paz) and in areas of Santa Cruz. There was a 
single case in Franz Tamayo in 1989. In 1990, 10 cases were 
reported, two of which were fatal. No other cases have been 
reported since.

  [Text] An electoral court on 25 May ordered an inquest to 
investigate if Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the Workers Party [PT] 
presidential candidate, violated the law when he used a sound 
truck from a union affiliated with the Sole Workers Center [CUT] 
in an election rally. Judge Alex Vilenozski ordered Lula, the 
PT, and the union to refrain from repeating this action and 
ordered the Civilian and Military Police to prevent the use of 
union equipment by presidential candidates in Sao Bernardo do 
Campo. Lula commented on the court ruling in Rio de Janeiro. 
  He said: Between what is legal and what is just, I believe 
the latter is more important.

  [Text] Brasilia, 31 May (AE) -- At a luncheon with 
entrepreneurs from Brasilia and its satellite towns, Workers 
Party [PT] presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said 
that some people should fear his electoral victory. These 
people are tax evaders, speculators, corrupt people, and large 
estate owners who have unproductive land. 
  He sent a message to speculators, warning them to be 
careful. 
He promised: "Speculators will have to invest their money in 
productive areas of the economy." Lula said that the current 
problem is that the government pretends to have a fiscal policy, 
and people pretend to pay taxes. "These people cheat everybody, 
and no one thinks about Brazil." 
  The PT candidate said that the country does not need big 
laws, but big accords. "If we have clear rules, agreed upon by 
the parties involved, we will be able to establish rules that 
will allow Brazil to grow." Lula remembers that one can only 
govern by ensuring credibility among social protagonists, 
workers, entrepreneurs, and government officials. Lula promised 
to implement the country's first agrarian reform and to end 
corruption.

  [Text] Brasilia, 31 May (AE) -- The so-called progressive 
faction of the Catholic Church will celebrate on 7 September the 
"National Day To Pray for Brazil -- Lula for President." This 
faction of the church incluudes bishops such as Tomas Balduino, 
of Goias Velho; Pedro Casaldaliga, from Araguaia in Mato Grosso 
State; Augusto Rocha, of Picos in Piaui State; and Friar 
Leonardo Boff and Friar Betto. 
  During Lula's debate, which was held today within the 
framework of his electoral campaign, Friar Betto reported on the 
national pro-Lula day celebration. He said that the day will be 
celebrated in various forms, and in the largest possible number 
of parishes countrywide. He added: "There could be prayers, 
rosaries, marches, liturgical celebrations, and masses 
supporting Lula's candidacy." Lula met Brasilia and Goias State 
representatives of the Catholic Church. 
  Friar Betto said that as the Brazilian Catholic Church has 
decided to give preferential attention to the problems of the 
destitute Brazilians, it is clear that it must support someone 
like Lula. He said: "To support the election of a worker who 
was born poor is consistent with giving preferential attention 
to the problems of the most destitute people." The Catholic 
Church will celebrate the pro-Lula day on 7 September, on the 
anniversary of Brazilian independence.

  [Text] Admiral Henrique Goulart Fortuna yesterday announced 
his presidential candidacy for the PSC [Social Christian Party]. 
His platform should please the military, in light of his 
proposal to increase federal budget allocations for the Armed 
Forces from 2.7 percent to 5 percent. 
  The 60-year-old admiral served as commander of the War 
College from 1991 until his retirement in 1993. He joined the 
PSC in January with the intention of running for a federal 
deputy seat. Because it has become impossible for the PSC to 
nominate Senator Jose Sarney (Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party) as its presidential candidate, the PSC has decided to 
promote Goulart Fortuna's candidacy. 
  Goulart Fortuna said: "The PSC national board has entrusted 
me with this mission, and I have accepted."

<F P=106> [Report by Sergio Malbergier] </F>
  [Text] The British Government Export Credit Guarantee 
Department (ECGD) announced yesterday that it has reopened 
credit coverage of exports to Brazil, which had been suspended 
in 1983. 
  The measure was a consequence of Brazil's renegotiation of 
its foreign debt with banks and "the encouraging progress of the 
stabilization program," an ECGD communique says. 
  Michael Heseltine, secretary of state for trade and 
industry, 
said: "The resumption of the ECGD coverage of exports to Brazil 
will provide new opportunities for British companies." 
  "Brazil is the ninth largest economy in the world, and it 
will be even more open now that the effects of the debt crisis 
will begin to decrease," Heseltine said in a communique. 
  The coverage of credits was suspended in 1983 due to 
Brazil's 
delays in paying its debt. The coverage was resumed in 1989, 
but it was again suspended following new Brazilian delays with 
its debt. 
  The ECGD said that it would concentrate on covering private 
companies, particularly in areas that will encourage the 
rehabilitation of the country's economy. 
  Douglas Hurd, secretary of state for foreign and 
commonwealth 
affairs, visited Brazil at the beginning of April with a 
delegation of entrepreneurs. On that occasion he said that the 
United Kingdom wanted to increase economic relations between the 
two countries.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 26 May. 
  The Central Bank has reported that the monetary base grew by 
a nominal 37 percent in April; 3.9 percent less than in March. 
It also reported that in April the Brazilian international net 
reserves totaled $38.3 billions while its short term reserves 
totaled $32.3 billion. During the same period, the monetary 
base grew 49 percent by the peak concept and 45 percent by the 
daily average concept. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in 
Portuguese 20 May 94 p B4) 
  Alexandre Loloian, Labor Ministry Employment and Salary 
Policies secretary, has reported that during the first quarter 
the national labor market registered 70,981 new jobs, of which 
48,796 were created in March -- 0.22 percent up on February. 
(Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 21 May 94 p B5) 
  Based on a study of the daily quotation of 1,300 products 
sold in 11 supermarket chains, Abilio Diniz, vice president of 
the Pao de Acucar supermarket chain, foresees that supermarket 
prices will have to be adjusted before the implementation of the 
real because there is a 15 to 20 percent price difference 
between sale and stock replacement prices. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE 
SAO PAULO in Portuguese 24 May 94 S2 p 9) 
  Household appliance sales, which had increased considerably 
during the first quarter of the year, dropped by 20 percent in 
May compared with the same month last year. This led several 
companies to plan collective vacations for their employees. 
Most of the 4,000 Arno company employees will have a 5-week 
vacation as of June, the company president announced. Lourival 
Kicula, who coordinates household appliances industries, says 
all companies currently have a 15 to 30-day stock which is 
beyond the desirable stock of 5 days. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO 
PAULO in Portuguese 24 May 94 S2 p 1) 
  The Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries has reported 
that the unemployment level increased by 0.25 percent during the 
second week of May with the dismissal of 5,893 employees in Sao 
Paulo. The accumulated unemployment rate this year is 1.8 
percent or 43,800 dismissals. The accumulated unemployment rate 
for the past 12 months is 2.82 percent following the dismissal 
of 66,837 workers. Of the 46 industries studied, most workers 
were dismissed in the textile, railway equipment, paper, 
cardboard, and rubber industries. The industries with greatest 
job hirings were marble, granite, metal frames, doors, windows, 
and construction materials. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in 
Portuguese 25 May 94 p 2) 
  The attempt by the Espirito Santo government to privatize 
its 
23,17 percent participation in the Espirito Santo Power Plants, 
Escelsa, through an auction at the Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange 
on 24 May failed completely due to the lack of bidders. A new 
auction should be held next 1 or 6 June. The base price of each 
Escelsa share was quoted at $100. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in 
Portuguese 25 May 94 p21) 
  The Brazilian Federation of Bank Associations today made 
public a report on the 1993 banking social balance which shows 
that the banks made a $2.9 billion profit on net assets which 
amount to $24 billion. Profits amounted to 12.3 percent of 
their assets. The dividends paid by the banks to their 
shareholders amounted to $730 million. The report shows that 
during 1993 the banks paid $22 billion in salaries to their 
674,500 employees and $2.3 billion in taxes and social 
contributions. The Brazilian banking system consists of 244 
banks with more than 31,000 branches, holding more than 47 
million savings accounts and 44 million checking accounts, 3.7 
million of which correspond to companies. The report shows that 
the average monthly volume of credit operations amounts to $95 
billion, their portfolio of financial applications and 
securities amounts to $25 billion, 80 percent of which is made 
up of government papers. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese

  [Text] Santiago, 31 May (EFE) -- Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shi'mon Peres said today in the Chilean capital that his country 
will continue the peace talks, this time with Syria, Jordan, and 
Lebanon. 
  In a news conference given a few hours after arriving in 
Santiago, Peres, who was protected by a strong security force, 
said Israel has "a very long agenda" for its Arab neighbors, and 
reiterated that it is willing to continue with the peace process. 
  He said that he was, however, "bewildered" by the recent 
remarks of Yasir 'Arafat about the "holy war," although he said 
that to judge a situation one must look at the initiatives and 
the facts. 
  Peres said 'Arafat had made a mistake, and that his comments 
do not contribute to the peace process. But he preferred to 
base his judgement on the implementation of the agreement, which 
shows "that a new reality is taking place in Gaza and Jerico." 
  He noted that the PLO has not carried out terrorist actions 
in those territories, and that despite the pain of this old 
language used by 'Arafat, the plan is promising. 
  He recalled that the agreement granting autonomy to the 
Palestinians of Gaza and Jericho is "temporary, for five years," 
and that after the political enrivonment changes permanent 
agreements will be established. 
  He advocated relations with Latin America for the opening up 
of new markets. He is also sure that the region will become 
like the European Community, as the right trend is to make 
"geographic proximity into economic advantage." 
  Peres praised the Chilean process, which he considered 
"impressive" because of its political freedom and economic 
stability which, he said, is quite an exception in the region. 
  Perez met this morning with Chilean President Eduardo Frei, 
who reiterated Chilean support for the peace process with the 
Palestinian people. 
  Peres said: "We talked about strengthening the old 
friendship between the two countries in the fields of economy, 
trade, and technological and scientific development." 
  Peres also met with Chilean Agriculture Minister Emiliano 
Ortega and with his Chilean counterpart Carlos Figueroa, to 
exchange views on the possibility of establishing joint business 
initiatives and to share Israeli technology for recovering the 
desert. 
  This program is one of the points of greater interest for 
Chile, which has a large desert in the north. Peres said his 
country is willing to provide all possible aid in this field. 
  He also said that Israel is open to trade negotiations with 
Chile like the ones it proposed to Mexico and Colombia, the 
other two countries included in his Latin American tour, which 
ends tomorrow in Santiago. 
  Regarding international relations, Peres said that Israel 
expects to receive Chilean support in its peace negotiations 
with the Arabs at the United Nations, and that Chile will take 
an "objective" position in that international organization. 
  He recalled that in Chile there is an important Arab 
community which, he believes, should support Palestinian 
autonomy in Gaza and Jericho just as the Jewish communities 
abroad support Israel. 
  Peres declined to answer if his country would receive 
Chilean 
Army Commander General Augusto Pinochet, whose trip to Israel 
has been announced a number of times. Peres said this 
possibility has not emerged, and therefore it has no answer. 
  Peres also met today with Chilean Defense Minister Edmundo 
Perez Yoma, and plans to lecture at the Chilean Foreign Ministry.

  [Text] Santiago, 31 May (EFE) -- Chilean Senator Andres 
Zaldivar of the Christian Democratic Party, who returned 
yesterday from a trip to Havana, advocates the resumption of 
diplomatic relations with Cuba and the lifting of the economic 
embargo on the island. Zaldivar, whose comments were released 
today, said he was really impressed with the dramatic situation 
affecting the Cuban people, who "are starving because rationing 
is brutally strict." 
  Zaldicar, who belongs to the most important party in the 
coalition governing Chile, said cooperation must be sought to 
find a political solution that would allow Cuba to evolve toward 
democracy. 
  According to Zaldivar, the way to reach a political opening 
must be discussed with Cuban President Fidel Castro. He said: 
"Fidel Castro is maintaining his leadership. I saw that. The 
people are with Fidel Castro. And we should take note of that." 
  Zaldivar has the impression that Cuba is a besieged region 
in 
the medieval sense, which even creates the fear that the crisis 
may evolve into a collective sacrifice, which he believes would 
be inadmissible. He added: "We should follow a path toward 
opening up relations, not with the objective of validating a 
regime with which I disagree, but in order to help Cuba in a 
transition toward democracy." 
  During his stay in Havana, Zaldivar met with the Cuban 
ministers of finance and agriculture, but he did not have any 
contact with the opposition. Christian Democratic Party 
President Gutemberg Martinez, however, will meet with all Cuban 
political sectors during the visit he will make to Cuba in the 
next few days. 
  Zaldivar went to Cuba as president of the Spanish foundation 
Ibero-American-European Research and Promotion Center, which he 
created when he was living in exile in Madrid. 
  Diplomatic relations between Havana and Santiago were broken 
in 1973 after the military coup that overthrew the Chilean 
Socialist government headed by Salvador Allende. Relations were 
resumed at the consular level in 1990 after the return of 
democracy in Chile. Various Chilean Socialist and Social 
Democratic sectors of the government Coalition of Parties for 
Democracy have expressed support for the full reestablishment of 
relations with Cuba, which is expected to be achieved in the 
next few weeks.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 31 May (AFP) -- Today, the local 
newspaper EL TIEMPO indicated that the Colombian Government 
expects an explanation from the United States for its sudden 
decision to suspend the operation of two radars installed in 
Colombia to detect drug planes. This followed the publication 
of the U.S. decision by the THE WASHINGTON POST on 29 May. 
  According to EL TIEMPO, government spokespersons referred to 
Washington's decision as "inconsiderate, untimely, unilateral, 
and rude." THE WASHINGTON POST said the Pentagon ordered the 
suspension of the operation of four radars used in the fight 
against drug trafficking, which are located in Colombia and 
Peru. In Colombia, the radars are located in Araracuara and 
Leticia, in the southeastern Department of Amazonas. 
  According to EL TIEMPO, since 1 May, the U.S. soldiers who 
operate the radars stopped briefing the Colombian Air Force on 
the flights detected. EL TIEMPO adds that the U.S. Government 
has not officially notified its Colombian counterpart of its 
decision. The Colombian Government asked Washington for an 
explanation 28 days ago, but thus far, it has not received a 
reply, EL TIEMPO discloses. The newspaper also reveals that a 
government spokesperson stated that "it is obvious that if the 
radars are not working, it makes no sense to keep them and the 
technicians on Colombian territory."

  [Text] International treaties are usually agreements 
benefiting two parties; one party cannot decide when to comply 
and when not to. It seems that this is now the case with an 
agreement signed by the United States and Colombia on bases for 
the surveillance of drug trafficking. 
  In this case, it was clear Colombia rendered a service to 
the 
United States and not the other way around. It would be 
preferable for our policy to be increasingly independent because 
those installations are not useful even for monitoring civilian 
air traffic in Colombia, rather for rendering service only to 
U.S. addicts [viciosos].

  [Excerpts] Santa Fe de Bogota, 29 May (NOTIMEX) -- Official 
sources have reported Colombian President Cesar Gaviria today 
canceled his trip to El Salvador where he was to attend the 
swearing in ceremony of Salvadoran President-elect Armando 
Calderon Sol. Presidential Palace spokespersons have said the 
Colombian president will not attend the swearing in ceremony, 
because the doctors who performed surgery on his right foot 10 
days ago have recommended rest. [passage omitted] 
  Gaviria underwent surgery on 19 May to relieve pressure in 
his posterior tibial nerve. Using crutches, the Colombian 
president was the first to vote in Sunday's presidential 
elections, in which 18 candidates sought to become president of 
Colombia for the next four years. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Guillermo Rodriguez from the Catam Military </F>
Airport -- live] 
  [Text] Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has arrived. 
A very important event has taken place in his first public act: 
the Jewish-Palestine community has greeted him, which is a sign 
of new times. Peres praised Colombian democracy and said things 
are being corrected in Colombia through elections and that it is 
a privilege for him to arrive just when Colombia is voting. He 
also said Jerusalem will continue to be Israel's capital, but 
that Jerusalem will not be divided as Berlin was after World War 
II. Peres said he believes more in deeds than words regarding 
Palestinian leader Arafat's unfortunate remarks to the effect 
there would be a jihad or sacred war to liberate Palestine. 
Here is Shim'on Peres: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Do you believe 
that 
results will allow your [as heard] country to continue to make 
great economic strides? 
  [Peres, in English with passage-by-passage translation into 
Spanish] All of Latin America is undergoing great changes and is 
making important changes to the world outlook. Colombia, as one 
of the four great countries in Latin America, will play an 
important role. It is a great pleasure for me to have the 
opportunity to improve relations between Colombia and Israel. 
[end recording] 
  This was part of the statements made by Shim'on Peres, 
architect of the Middle East peace process. He feels very 
satisfied and said he is confident that peace in the Middle East 
will be lasting. He intends to visit several voting tables; he 
will also visit the Gold Museum; and he will meet the president 
and they will issue a joint communique. This is the first visit 
Israeli foreign minister to Colombia.

  [Text] Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said today 
that the world is moving toward an era of expanded markets and 
communities, adding that this is the moment for the awakening of 
the Americas. Peres, who arrived in Santa Fe de Bogota for an 
official two-day visit to Colombia, met with President Cesar 
Gaviria for 40 minutes. Peres congratulated Gaviria for being 
elected OAS secretary general, a position that the outgoing 
Colombian president will fill in September in replacement of 
Brazilian Joao Baena Soares. 
  The former Labor Party leader, whose first Latin American 
tour also includes Mexico and Chile, said his visit to Colombia 
is the result of the fortunate rapprochement that began in 
December with Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio's 
visit to Israel.

  [Text] President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares has 
announced his government will seek Panama's entrance into the 
Group of Three (G-3), which includes Colombia, Mexico, and 
Venezuela, and rejoining the Rio Group. Meanwhile, he proposed 
as a solution to the Darien Gap problem the construction of an 
alternate road through the San Blas region. 
  Perez Balladares made these statements on Monday during a 
courtesy visit to Colombia, where he met with his colleague 
Cesar Gaviria, according to a news release from the 
president-elect's press office. 
  It also was learned that Perez Balladares proposed Panama's 
entry into the G-3 free trade agreement, which is to be signed 
by the governments of Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela on 14 June 
during the Ibero-American Summit of heads of state. 
  The president-elect also said that his government 
administration will seek readmission into the permanent market 
and political consensus know as the Rio Group, from which Panama 
was ousted during Manuel Antonio Noriega's military regime. 
  The press release also reports that Perez Balladares and 
Gaviria agreed on bilateral procedures to combat drug 
trafficking, particularly along the common border where an 
inter-American road is to be constructed. 
  Perez Balladares appeared in favor of modifying the road's 
route in an effort to reopen the inter-American road -- 
construction on the road was halted 20 years ago in the Darien 
Gap -- indicating that the San Blas area is the most feasible 
alternative for this project, according to the press release. 
  The future president was accompanied on this visit by his 
Foreign Minister-designate Gabriel Lewis Galindo, and Jose Luis 
Sosa, member of the governmental transition commission. 
  It also was officially announced that Perez Balladares will 
travel tomorrow to Puerto Rico, where he will hold a private 
meeting with Jose Rosello, governor of that Caribbean island. 
The president-elect's June visits to Japan and Taiwan, which 
are aimed at reestablishing commercial ties, were also confirmed.

  [Text] Colombia, China, and Russia were formally accepted 
yesterday as active members of the Pacific Basin Economic 
Council (known in English by the acronym PBEC), which is 
considered the world's most important business forum. 
  The formal inclusion of these nations occurred at the 27th 
General Assembly of the organization held in Kuala Lumpur, 
Malaysia. Important Colombian businessmen, accompanied by 
Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos, attended the meeting. 
  "This is an important step in our policy of diversifying 
outside the Paris-London-New York axis and getting closer to the 
most dynamic region of the world and the one with the brightest 
future," Santos said. 
  The PBEC is an organization that includes important 
businessmen from Asia, Canada, United States, Mexico, and Chile 
and whose goal is to expand the trading borders of PBEC member 
countries. This organization is different from the Pacific 
Economic Cooperation Conference (known by the English acronym 
PECC), which is a governmental institution that Colombia joined 
last March. 
  "The opportunities opened for the Colombian private sector 
are immense because here we are dealing with the big leagues," 
said Guillermo Fernandez de Soto, president of the Chamber of 
Commerce of Santa Fe de Bogota. 
  Meanwhile, Fernando Urrea, executive of the Colombian 
Leonisa 
Company and member of the Colombian delegation, said that "at 
forums such as this one, we realize the valuable opportunities 
that we businessmen have at our disposal to broaden our markets 
and also realize that we must seek markets abroad instead of 
waiting for them to come by the grace of God." 
<H5>  Colombia, Very Attractive </H5>
  Minister Juan Manuel Santos was invited to the General 
Assembly's plenary session in his capacity as presidential 
designate, along with the prime ministers of Malaysia and 
Vietnam. In his speech, Santos explained the opportunities 
offered by the Colombian economy and the privileged access to 
international markets it has achieved through its integration 
policy. "Colombia has become one of the most attractive houses 
in a neighborhood that is becoming more interesting by the day 
to foreign investment," the Colombian minister said in reference 
to the nation's prominent position in Latin America. 
  He mentioned the struggle against drug trafficking that the 
country has waged in the past years and requested greater 
international cooperation for this battle. "We have lost our 
most prominent politicians, our most honest judges, our most 
courageous officers, and our best journalists, and this great 
sacrifice has only reinforced our determination to eradicate 
this scourge," he added. 
  Colombia's interest in joining the PBEC lies in the growing 
importance of the area in the world economy. The 19 countries 
that make up the PBEC produced 50 percent of world GNP in 1993 
and registered an average growth rate of 3.7 percent. It is 
expected that by the end of this decade these economies will 
grow by more than $5 trillion, that is, more than one third of 
the world's growth up to the year 2000. 
  The PBEC is made up of: Australia, Canada, Colombia, Chile, 
China, Korea, the United States, Philippines, Hong Kong, 
Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Russia, 
Singapore, Thailand, and Taiwan.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 26 May (EFE) -- Cuban exports to 
Colombia increased by more than 1,600 percent in the first four 
months of the year, from $1.2 million to $21 million, the 
Colombian Foreign Trade Institute reported today. The institute 
said Cuba was the country with the greatest increase in exports 
to Colombia between January and April, as compared to the same 
period last year. Cuba is followed by the Cayman Islands (800 
percent), Poland (351 percent), and Sweden (210 percent). 
  Colombia and Cuba resumed their trade relations in 1990 and 
their diplomatic ties last October following 12 years of broken 
relations, which began in 1981 when President Julio Cesar Turbay 
accused the Cuban Government of Fidel Castro of supporting 
guerrilla groups. The Cuban Embassy in Colombia told EFE that 
Colombia imports steel, salt for industrial use, generic 
medicines, vaccines, and biotechnological products, from the 
Caribbean island while Colombia sells Cuba textiles, electricity 
cables, machinery, and coke, among other products. Colombia's 
greatest increase in imports, by groups of countries or economic 
blocs, came from the Andean Group countries (Bolivia, Peru, 
Ecuador, and Venezuela) where Colombian purchases increased 
20.82 percent followed by the European Union (EU) with 13.11 
percent. Colombian imports during the first four months of the 
year totalled $1.321 billion and its principal markets are the 
United States and Venezuela, in that order.

<F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] The internal disturbance decree that recently 
prevented a mass release of prison inmates today was placed in a 
precarious position. The "National Newscast" has learned that 
this afternoon the prosecutor will tell the Constitutional Court 
that the decree is unconstitutional. This will be announced in 
the next few hours. 
  Over the past two years, the government has issued internal 
disturbance decrees eight times. The most recent implementation 
of this measure was to prevent a mass exodus of inmates from 
Colombian jails. 
  The arguments the prosecutor could wield to call for a 
ruling 
that such decrees are unconstitutional are as follow: 
  1. He says that eight internal disturbance decrees have been 
used to undermine the rights of due process of many inmates who, 
because of the expiration of deadlines, should have been 
released from prison a long time ago, as stipulated by the Penal 
Procedures Code. 
  2. He criticizes the state for being unable to conduct 
investigations on people facing drug-trafficking and terrorism 
charges in an efficient and timely manner. 
  The court has already rejected a request from the prosecutor 
that it delay its ruling on the most recent internal disturbance 
decrees. The official ruling will be handed down in 20 days.

<F P=106> [From "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota -- While the candidates who 
qualified for the 19 June runoff have started to give new life 
to their political strategies to attract popular support, the 
government and the economic groups made a vehement call on 
Colombians to analyze the proposals of the two contenders and to 
vote massively. 
  While Liberal Ernesto Samper Pizano prefers to seek 
increased 
support from his party, including its former Colombian 
presidents, Conservative Andres Pastrana Arango prefers social 
aspects such as employment and education in his government 
program. Mr. Samper Pizano said he will focus on the 
agricultural sector. He said this sector must be saved to 
ensure the peasants continue living on their plots. 
  Although the directorate of the 19 April Movement Democratic 
Alliance will decide what political course to follow this 
Thursday, in view of the electoral defeat suffered last Sunday, 
there have already been contacts with the Samper camp to reach 
some agreements. 
  The two presidential candidates will start a new and 
fast-paced race for the Presidency today. They will try to 
maintain or increase the electoral support they received on 29 
May. The two of them garnered nearly 5.2 million votes. 
  Liberal statesmen Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala and Alfonso Lopez 
Michelsen are expected to renew their support for candidate 
Samper Pizano and to urge citizens to vote. 
  Despite the optimism of the two candidates about winning a 
majority of the votes in the 19 June runoff, groups such as 
National Exporters Association and Asoexpro [expansion unknown] 
predicted a lower turnout in the runoffs due to tiresome 
abstentionism, a lack of political culture, the poor definition 
[poca identidad] of the parties, and the enthusiasm displayed by 
Colombia for the opening of the world soccer championship in the 
United States.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 31 May. 
  On 23 May, the Foreign Trade Institute reported that 
Colombian imports during the first four months of 1994 totaled 
$5.278 million. This represents a 22.7 percent increase over the 
same period last year. Imports of raw materials amounted to 
$2.1746 million -- 41.2 percent of all imports during the same 
period. The United States continues to be Colombia's main 
supplier. Venezuela is second. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in 
Spanish 24 May 94 p 1B, 2B) 
  Colombian exports to Venezuela dropped 6.5 percent during 
the 
first two months of 1994 because of a strong devaluation of the 
bolivar. (Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network in Spanish

  [Text] Unofficial reports have stated that Paraguayan 
Foreign Minister Dr. Luis Maria Boettner Ramirez and Uruguayan 
Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu Bonilla have drawn up a bilateral 
policy for Mercosur [Common Market of the South] to partly 
counterbalance the differences existing with Argentina and 
Brazil. Yesterday, Paraguayan Foreign Minister Dr. Luis Maria 
Boettner Ramirez denied, however, that Paraguay and Uruguay have 
formed a front or drawn up regional strategies. 
  Negotiations to establish a common external tariff have 
exposed disagreements among the four Mercosur countries. 
Paraguay and Uruguay want low tariffs to develop their 
old-fashioned industries while Brazil prefers to keep high 
tariffs to protect their high technological production. 
Argentina is pursuing an intermediate and rather reconciliatory 
stance. 
  Three significant meetings to discuss the common external 
tariff issue are planned. The economy vice ministers of the 
four Mercosur countries will meet on 17 June, the Mercosur 
foreign ministers will meet on 9 July, and the presidents of the 
signatory countries will meet on 10 July. 
  With this in mind, it was unofficially mentioned that 
Paraguayan and Uruguayan officials, headed by their respective 
foreign ministers, have drawn up a bilateral policy to 
counterbalance the Brazilian stance of keeping their tariffs 
high. During the most recent meeting on 9 May in Buenos Aires, 
representatives of Itamar Franco's administration were 
unyielding on reducing their tariffs. 
  The Uruguayan foreign minister returned to Montevideo 
yesterday. He denied that his visit to Paraguay was specifically 
to form a bilateral bloc within Mercosur. He noted that his 
visit to our country sought to enhance bilateral trade. He 
added that when Mercosur was discussed, they sought to enhance 
the integration process, bearing in mind that it will be 
implemented within seven months (on 1 January 1995). 
  Foreign Minister Ramirez Boettner agreed with his Uruguayan 
counterpart. He said they thoroughly reviewed bilateral 
economic issues. The Paraguayan foreign minister added: "This 
is why our talks, which have been extremely useful, lasted two 
days (24 and 25 May). I believe that on very few occasions have 
we thoroughly reviewed all bilateral and multilateral issues." 
  The Paraguayan foreign minister noted that when Mercosur was 
discussed, an effort was made to strengthen it because a 
political decision has been made by the four governments to 
implement the integration process. He said: "We have combined 
strategies, but in no way have any blocs been formed between our 
countries. We are all together in the Mercosur."

<F P=106> [Interview with Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu </F>
Bonilla by Hugo Ruiz Olazar; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Ruiz] The newspapers are 
always discussing Uruguay's and Paraguay's unfavorable position 
compared with the giants Brazil and Argentina in this Mercosur 
[Common Market of the South] process... 
  [Abreu] I believe it is the other way round. We have a 
positive view of Mercosur... 
  [Ruiz] What are you basing... 
  [Abreu] In a world that requires a gradual opening, with 
greater competitivity, it is significantly unfavorable for us to 
remain enclosed or isolated. Mercosur is a potential market of 
200-million inhabitants. 
  [Ruiz] Why then are we hearing so many warnings about the 
risks involved in Mercosur? 
  [Abreu] There are two basic pillars we have to handle 
together: democracy and integration. Uruguay's Mercosur 
strategy is -- and I will stick to the words of Enrique 
Iglesias, a former Uruguayan foreign minister and current IDB 
[Inter-American Development Bank] president -- first, Mercosur; 
second, Mercosur; and third, Mercosur. 
  [Ruiz] Do you believe Uruguay and Paraguay are unable to 
influence the two giants, Argentina and Brazil, which are 
apparently engulfing everything ...? 
  [Abreu] Quite the contrary! Quite the contrary! We have the 
same possibilities as the smaller countries in the EU, despite 
all the differences ... 
  [Ruiz] Not long ago, the newspapers seriously discussed the 
possibility of Uruguay withdrawing from Mercosur ... 
  [Abreu] Uruguay is not linked to the possibility of 
withdrawing from Mercosur ... 
  [Ruiz] This issue was discussed at length here in Asuncion 
... 
  [Abreu] Quite the contrary. Uruguay's stance involves 
confirming and strengthening Mercosur ... You must know that it 
is quite different to have four countries talking to other 
economic blocs than to have countries talking separately, 
especially if they involve Uruguay and Paraguay ... The 
president of the Republic issued a public denial ... 
  [Ruiz] Why are importers against Mercosur? 
  [Abreu] Of course, there are economic circles that will not 
be favored by a comprehensive strategy. Integration involves an 
adjustment process. It is a process marked by growing pains. 
It is very important here to handle conflicts and traumas ... 
  [Ruiz] It will not be possible to achieve a zero common 
external tariff by 1 January 1995. What is your opinion? 
  [Abreu] We are not so pessimistic. Uruguay does not believe 
the schedule should be moved back. The common external tariff 
as it is must be negotiated, but must be implemented ... 
  [Ruiz] For Paraguay, a landlocked country, there is a key 
point, namely freight, the waterway. Some people fear the River 
Plate tolls to be collected by Argentina and Uruguay will 
increase freight ... 
  [Abreu] As projected, the waterway links Puerto Caceres with 
Nueva Palmira. It is necessary to seek a sea outlet from Nueva 
Palmira. The channels will be dredged: the Martin Garcia 
Channel in Uruguay and the Mitre Channel in Argentina. Private 
companies will carry out the dredging and will charge a toll to 
recover their investment, but only for large ships. This toll 
will not apply to normal waterway transportation ... [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Israeli Ambassador to Paraguay Shmu'el Merom said 
this morning that the Israeli Government has decided to close 
its embassy in Paraguay and three other Latin American countries 
as part of a world reorganization of its foreign service. The 
diplomat made the announcement at Government Palace after 
meeting with President Juan Carlos Wasmosy. 
  At the end of the meeting, Merom said the closure of the 
Israeli Embassy is purely a matter of internal reorganization, 
adding that Israel has 17 embassies in Latin America, which is 
considered excessive. Merom said Israel will place more 
emphasis on the Muslim countries in their region, adding that 
his country needs increased relations and understanding with 
these nations in view of the requirements of the new world 
order. The ambassador said a commission had studied the 
coverage of embassies in order to relocate them. 
  Finally, Merom said his country cannot maintain so many 
embassies in Latin America, adding that this is the single 
reason why his country decided to "close" this embassy in 
Paraguay.

  [Text] Yesterday, Finance Minister Crispiniano Sandoval 
said the evidence clearly shows that the entrepreneurial state 
is a failure, and public companies, most of which operate with 
deficits and provide poor services to the community, must be 
transferred to private hands. Political interests should not be 
a major factor in the issue of privatizations. The most 
important concern should be the national reality and the need to 
reform the state, the minister said. "If we want to reform and 
reduce the state, we must privatize public companies," Sandoval 
stressed. 
  "Here, the question is one of structure or change of 
structures. No matter what government is installed in the 
country, it must proceed with the privatization program," 
Sandoval said. The issue, however, continues to face opposition 
in the Senate. Sandoval said the privatization of public 
companies is an economic, social, and political fact currently 
in effect everywhere in the world because it has been recognized 
that the entrepreneurial state is a failure. Consequently, it is 
necessary to transfer inefficient state companies to the private 
sector, Sandoval said. 
  The minister recalled that in the past, such entities were 
put under state control because of a doctrine that practically 
did not leave anything in private hands. Sandoval said the 
Wasmosy administration has the clear purpose of implementing a 
privatization program. "Political interests cannot prevail, for 
the national reality is at stake. No matter the political 
orientation, if we want to reduce and reform the state, we must 
transfer public companies to private hands," the minister said. 
  Sandoval pointed out that all governments need to open up 
their administration, adding that an indication of that openness 
will be "getting rid of inefficient state companies." The 
minister said some people wrongly think that privatizing means 
losing state assets. 
  "Political interests should not prevail. The most important 
thing is the decision to reduce the state, which must become 
more efficient. The state must get rid of the burden of 
maintaining public companies that more often than not operate in 
the red and provide poor services, according to the evaluation 
made by the community itself." 
  When reporters pointed out that politicians, particularly 
from the Colorado Party, do not seem to want these companies 
transferred to private hands because they are used for 
patronage, Sandoval said he did not think privatizations will 
have a political cost. "I think the electoral cost could be a 
lot worse if backward economic structures are maintained," 
Sandoval added. 
  The minister said no political party will succeed unless it 
can modernize the country's economic base to encourage private 
investments. "We will get many more votes if we get the country 
to sustain solid growth. This can be achieved only if we 
eliminate factors creating backwardness and underdevelopment, 
that is, inefficient companies. Maintaining these companies 
will have a political cost in the long term," the finance 
minister concluded.

  [Excerpt] Paraguay and the United States have not yet 
designated their respective reciprocal ambassadors. This makes 
you wonder whether there is an impasse, although Foreign 
Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner denies this. In Paraguay's 
case, the delay in designating a new ambassador has been 
greater. Paraguay has not had an ambassador in Washington since 
January 1994 when Juan Esteban Aguirre resigned that post. 
Aguirre is currently occupying a high-level Inter-American Bank 
(IDB) position in Peru. 
  Ramirez Boettner said the country has already asked the 
United States for its agreement on one name for the post, and 
the ministry is awaiting an answer before submitting the 
nomination to the Senate. The foreign minister did not want to 
provide the name of the future ambassador, saying: "It is not 
customary to release the name of an ambassador-designate until 
the country where he is supposed to serve sends its agreement." 
  Ramirez Boettner said the delay in designating a U.S. 
ambassador to Paraguay to replace Jon Glassman is not a sign of 
disagreement with Paraguay. "It is absolutely normal. They are 
going through a transition period during which they are choosing 
an adequate candidate for the post. It is absolutely normal, 
and we have splendid relations with the United States in all 
respects," the foreign minister said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Lima, 26 May (EFE) -- On 25 May the Peruvian Army 
concluded the antiterrorist offensive that began in April in the 
jungle zone of Leoncio Prado Province, Huanuco Department. The 
Army called the operation a success despite accusations of 
having indiscriminately bombed civilians. 
  The military operation called Aries was aimed against the 
Shining Path [SL] members who operated in the area with two 
battalions known as Red Sea and Local Force which, according to 
military officers, were reduced by 40 percent in Huanuco. 
  The National Human Rights Coordinating Board claimed in 
April 
that during the military offensive civilians had been bombed and 
innocent people murdered, and that in one area about 50 people 
had been killed as a consequence of the excesses committed by 
the military. 
  Committees from several humanitarian organizations, and even 
from Congress, visited the Leoncio Prado region to verify the 
accusations, after which they said they had not found proof of 
bombings or massacres, although they did obtain some reports of 
human rights violations committed by the military. 
  The military chief of the zone, General Alfredo Rodriguez, 
reported at the end of the operation that the two terrorist 
battalions had been disbanded, and that the SL columns still 
remaining in the jungle zone north of Lima are out of contact, 
without provisions, and partially disarmed. 
  The general added that the Red Sea battalion was reduced to 
40 men, and that the Local Force members were disbanded. He 
added that Red Sea chief Jose Picon, aka Manco, and another 20 
SL members abandoned his group and hid in the Monzon area. 
  Rodriguez said that the SL groups are trying to replenish 
their ranks with young men they kidnap from jungle towns and 
whom they force to join the SL ranks under threat of death. 
  The military chief considered the Aries operation to be 
successful, as "it has left the subversives with few weapons" 
and "a great deal of ammunition" was confiscated. 
  According to the military officer the terrorists are trying 
to reorganize themselves, for which reason the Peruvian military 
forces cordoned off the area to prevent them from doing so. 
  Gen. Rodriguez nonetheless pointed out that the ending of 
the 
Aries operation does not mean that the military have stopped 
exerting pressure in the area, because they must prevent the SL 
bases from reorganizing. 
  On 25 May the military high command presented to journalists 
at the Tingo Maria military base in Leoncio Prado Province 23 SL 
members captured during the operation, during which a total of 
30 men were arrested. The military also displayed weapons, 
explosives, medicines, communications equipment, documents, and 
propaganda material confiscated from the terrorists. 
  Gen. Rodriguez showed a copy book in which an SL member 
known 
as Comrade Angel had written an order to his comrades to 
"facilitate the access of the Red Cross to all the combat areas." 
  Gen. Rodriguez said he suspected that members of the Red 
Cross were informing the SL of Army movements, something which 
has not been proven.

  [Text] Lima, 31 May (EFE) -- Oswaldo Sandoval, president of 
the Foreign Relations Committee of the Peruvian Congress, said 
today that the U.S. decision to withdraw its airplanes and 
radars supporting drug enforcement in Peru favors drug 
trafficking. Sandoval said the U.S. decision "is incoherent, 
and lacks logic, as everyone recognizes that drug enforcement is 
the responsibility of producers as well as consumers." 
  Sandoval said that without U.S. logistical support in Peru 
"the mafias could transport drugs without fear of being 
intercepted by the Peruvian Air Force, which joined the drug 
enforcement effort with recognized success in 1992." 
  Arnaldo Velarde, Peruvian delegate before the Inter-American 
Committee for the Control of Drugs and Drug Abuse (CICAD), said 
that the interruption of the U.S. aid was decided "unilaterally, 
and without consultation." 
  Velarde also confirmed that Washington has suspended the 
flights of its AWAC and Orion airplanes, and has ordered the 
withdrawal of the radar operating in Yurimaguas that is used to 
control flights at the Peruvian and Colombian border. 
  Velarde said: "This will greatly hurt drug enforcement, 
because the Peruvian Air Force lacks the necessary means to 
detect the airplanes flying on the Colombian border, 99 percent 
of which are used to carry cocaine." 
  The suspension of aid was recommended by the State 
Department 
with the argument that shooting down civilian airplanes 
suspected of carrying drugs "is a violation of international 
law." 
  The flights of the AWAC and Orion airplanes, which are 
equipped with high technology radars, allowed the Peruvian Air 
Force to detect and intercept the drug trafficking airplanes, 
which in some cases, when they refused to obey the orders to 
land, were shot down. 
  Velarde said that Peru will continue "with its own means" 
the 
drug enforcement effort, but he indicated that the detection of 
airplanes carrying drugs "will be slower, difficult, and 
expensive" without the U.S. aid.

  [Text] Lima, 31 May (EFE) -- Lima newspapers reported on 31 
May that a Peruvian judge has rejected the conditional release 
of one general and 11 military officers arrested on drug 
trafficking charges. 
  Judge Gloria Arteaga dismissed the petition to release the 
military officers as inadmissible, because "important steps to 
confirm or dismiss the charges" filed by military justice 
against them are still pending. 
  The Army placed General Jaime Rios, former Huallaga Front 
commander, and the other 11 military officers indicted with him 
at the disposal of civilian courts after it was discovered that 
they had covered up drug trafficking activities in the region. 
  The officers involved, besides Gen. Rios, are: Lieutenant 
Colonels Luis Aparicio and Marco Zarate; Majors Marco Landor, 
Alejandro Mutante, and Eliseo Gonzalez; Captains Oswaldo Zapata, 
Carlos Hernandez, and Carlos Marin; Lieutenant Rolando Chiotty; 
and noncommissioned officers Roberto Zarate and Luis Gomez. 
  In 1991 all of them were stationed in the Huallaga Valley, 
the largest cocaine paste production center in the world. 
  The officers are accused of having charged a fee to permit 
drug traffickers to ship their cocaine paste to Colombia. 
  The lawsuit says that the military charged a fee of $8,000 
to 
single engine planes, and $15,000 to double engine planes, to 
permit them to land and take off in the zone to collect drugs. 
  The money was collected by Uchiza's former Mayor Demetrio 
Diaz and Uchiza's former Governor Carlos Rodriguez. The two are 
currently fugitives. 
  Drug traffickers provided medicines and food to the troops 
through a "civic committee" that coordinated "donations" made 
through Maj. Landor and Lt. Col. Zarate. These two are 
currently in jail under charges of trying to depose Peruvian 
President Alberto Fujimori in 1992.

<F P=106> [Interview with Peruvian Economy Minister Jorge Camet; place </F>
and date not given] 
  [Text] [EXPRESO] We still do not know what to do with the 
money obtained from the privatization process and now you have 
an extra $1.1 billion from the Support Group. What will we do 
with so much money? 
  [Camet] Aside from the money, these meetings are very 
positive because very high-level experts of the Support Group 
member countries and organization participate in them. They 
assess us and voice their concern over Peru. We listen and 
learn from their suggestions but we also inform them about what 
we are doing and what is happening in Peru. Last year we 
obtained $900 million... 
  [EXPRESO] What did you do with that $900 million? 
  [Camet] Some $450 million of it was loans from multilateral 
enterprises and the CAF [Andean Development Corporation]. This 
includes $200 million from the World Bank and the IDB 
[International Development Bank] for the Foncodes [National 
Compensation and Social Development Fund]. There is $98 million 
from the IDB for the health sector. Then there is between $50 
and $100 million from the PNUD [UN Development Program] and some 
$400 million in condoned debts. A total $300 million of 
condoned debts has materialized. Switzerland, for example, 
condoned $130 million. 
  [EXPRESO] What about this year? 
  [Camet] We are waiting for the World Bank, which arranges 
the 
Support Group meetings, to itemize the $1.1 billion. Some $250 
million is earmarked for donations and technical assistance. 
The remaining $850 million are soft and normal loans from 
multilateral enterprises and countries represented at the 
meeting. 
  [EXPRESO] Does it include all the loans from the 
multilateral 
organizations? 
  [Camet] Not all of them. Only those for the sectors for 
which we have asked the Support Group for help. Last year we 
asked for financial aid for Foncodes, for the health and 
education fields. This year we have asked for assistance to 
solve the poverty problem and for a very ambitious long-term 
program to eradicate poverty. The World Bank, for example, has 
financed the construction of rural neighborhood roads in the 
poorest zones. That sort of thing. 
  [EXPRESO] As for the letter of intent, we were surprised to 
see that the government intends to implement additional taxes if 
it does not attain the 12.1 percent goal. 
  [Camet] Some interpretations are incorrect. There are 
rumors, for example, that there will be no more stability 
contracts [contratos de estabilidad] or that they will be 
eliminated. This is not true. There might be a translation 
problem. We have agreed that the government will respect the 
stability contracts. We will not generate new stability 
contracts with special clauses compared to other stability 
contracts already approved. Nobody will get more than others, 
or more than what is established by law. This is the agreement 
we have reached. We have also agreed to allow enterprises on 
the border or in jungle areas -- with which we have signed 
stability contracts -- to cancel them, but by negotiation. If 
an enterprise in a given zone enjoys certain privileges, then no 
other enterprise can settle in the same zone and compete. That 
would not be right. 
  [EXPRESO] Well, what about additional taxes? 
  [Camet] We agreed to a 12.1 percent tax revenue and we want 
Sunat [National Tax Administration Superintendency] to attain 
this goal. The entire program is based on the 12.1 percent tax 
revenue, and it must be attained. 
  [EXPRESO] Do you think the 12.1 percent tax revenue is 
feasible? 
  [Camet] Of course. Last year we concentrated on curbing 
inflation. This year we will concentrate on increasing our tax 
revenue. The money obtained through the privatization program 
cannot be used because we do not have a primary tax revenue 
surplus. The Sunat has done a good supervision job within the 
organization, cross-checking computer data, but now greater 
supervision outside the institution is necessary. The internal 
IGV [General Sales Tax] must grow. A few months ago we hired 
two foreign experts: a Chilean expert supervisor and another 
expert in pinpointing sectors where the tax evasion is worse. 
He will determine where we must start work. Internal IGV 
evasion amounts to 7 percent of the GDP. With these efforts and 
determination, and with some psychological actions like jailing 
some people, we will reduce tax evasion by at least one point 
this year. We will thus be able to use idle money obtained from 
privatizations without affecting the program. 
  [EXPRESO] We thought the IGV revenue amounted to around 4 
percent of the GDP. If it should have amounted to 9 percent 
(half of the tax), how can evasion amount to 7 percent? 
  [Camet] Yes, but from that 4 percent you must subtract what 
is collected at the customs (external IGV) and you have the 
internal IGV. The level of taxes collected by customs is good 
but they have a ceiling which is established by the 
importations. It is very close to this ceiling. The internal 
IGV has great potential but it does not increase enough. 
  [EXPRESO] But 18 percent is very high. 
  [Camet] We are talking about increasing our tax revenue by 
one point this year. That is all. Late last year -- by forcing 
taxpayers -- we reached 11.4 percent of the GDP. This means we 
could reach 12.1 percent. This year we must make a great effort 
in two critical areas: tax revenue and generating job 
opportunities. 
  [EXPRESO] What do you mean by generating job opportunities? 
Are you talking about Foncodes? 
  [Camet] No, not only Foncodes. Foncodes is a temporary and 
urgent relief at this moment for the extreme poverty problem. 
It is a matter of generating job opportunities. 
  [EXPRESO] The exchange rate does not seem to be a matter of 
concern in the letter of intent. 
  [Camet] It is a matter of concern. Experts are exhaustively 
studying this problem. 
  [EXPRESO] At the Economy Ministry or at the BCR [Central 
Reserve Bank]? 
  [Camet] Foreign experts are studying the problem at the 
Economy Ministry. They are also studying the problem at the 
BCR, of course. Right now there are plenty of dollars and we are 
investigating, and that is the reason why there are so many 
dollars because the deposits in the banks have ceased to 
increase and drug traffickers could not have increased the 
amount of dollars in the past few months. 
  [EXPRESO] Has the government being using Treasury funds to 
maintain the exchange rate... 
  [Camet] We have been helping. We purchased dollars to make 
an early payment on the foreign debt, for example. Somehow or 
another we have to help the BCR with Treasury funds, cautiously, 
because the emission capacity is limited. We cannot go issuing 
a great quantity of money for this purpose. 
  [EXPRESO] Another issue is the monetization or emission 
level. In March we issued money above the target we had 
established. It is also true that there is a greater demand for 
soles, which would justify a somewhat greater emission. 
  [Camet] This is another issue we are assessing: How long can 
we continue monetizing. The more substantial emission in March 
(3.5 percent instead of 1.9 percent) was not significant in 
absolute terms: it only amounted to 40 million soles, which is 
not very much. That amount will by no means generate inflation. 
It is true that the demand for soles is increasing. I once 
told [Foreign Relations Committee member] Manuel Moreyra that 
dedollarization is a mental process. It will take years for 
Peruvians to regain confidence in our currency. This is 
beginning to happen gradually. We have already surpassed 
inflationary expectations. The greater the demand for soles, 
the more currency we can issue without causing inflation. 
  [EXPRESO] The letter of intent talks of about 20 percent 
emission for the entire year. 
  [Camet] That is what we believe. We will see if a little 
more can be issued without affecting our anti-inflationary goal. 
The letter of intent is not inflexible. If someone comes up 
with a survey showing it is technically feasible to issue -- let 
us say -- 25 percent instead of 20 percent, we can do so. The 
IMF is an auditor. The letter of intent describes what the 
government intends to do. We draft the letter and discuss it 
with the IMF, but we are the ones who draft it.

  [Text] Yesterday Energy and Mines Minister Daniel Hokama 
Tokashiki asserted that the recovery currently being experienced 
in the mining sector, and especially the boom in gold 
production, are the principal activities reactivating the 
Peruvian economy. 
  Hokama said that 36 percent of the total foreign investments 
obtained in the past few years have been earmarked for the 
mining sector, despite the fact that only a little over 10 
percent of the Peruvian potential is being exploited. 
  While its mineral reserves place Peru as the seventh largest 
mineralogical district in the world, during the last decades no 
systematic mineral exploitations have been carried out. It is 
believed that there are great deposits yet to be found, and the 
country's progress could be based on the adequate development of 
the mining field, stated the minister. 
  Hokama added, however, that the inflow of fresh capital is 
not only encouraged by the existing potential, but also by the 
implementation of an open economy, by a controlled inflation, 
and by the outlook toward obtaining a fiscal balance. 
  In view of the new legal framework, important international 
mining enterprises have expressed their interest in investing in 
Peru. Among them are Anglo American, Cyprus-Amay, Cambior, RTZ 
[expansion unknown], Placer Dome, Noranda, Lac Minerals, 
Americana Barrick, and Asarco. 
  In referring to the boom in gold production, Hokama stated 
that in this field it is estimated that some 500,000 ounces of 
gold will be extracted this year from the Yanacocha and Maqui 
Maqui mines alone. 
  The minister explained that the Yanacocha project being 
developed by the U.S. enterprises Newmont and BGRG [expansion 
unknown], in partnership with the Peruvian enterprise 
Buenaventura, will this year yield a production of 250,000 
ounces, and that this amount will double as of December, when 
the Maqui Maqui project is implemented. 
  In comparing gold production over the past five years, in 
1990 the monthly production amounted to 2,400 ounces while in 
1993 the production amounted to 53,000 ounces. 
  Minister Hokama said that the new mining policy redefines 
the 
role played by the state in its capacity as administrator of 
natural resources: promoting private investment, supervising, 
and implementing precise and stable regulations. 
  In order to give an idea of the great mining potential of 
the 
country, he said that of the 128 million hectares making up the 
country's territory, 60 million correspond to mineral resources. 
He also commented that during the past 18 months requests have 
been made to exploit mineral deposits over a surface of 5 
million hectares. 
  Aware of the damages that mineral exploitation may cause to 
the ecosystem, the mining enterprises have started a series of 
actions designed to establish adequate mechanisms for 
safeguarding the environment. 
  This was confirmed by the Gold Committee of the National 
Mining and Oil Association, which stated that "there must be an 
equilibrium between the development of the mining sector and the 
preservation of the environment, sustained by shared 
responsibility on the part of the enterprises, the government, 
and the scientific community." 
  The business sector also referred to the great importance 
granted to the environment during the first international 
symposium on gold held in Peru.

<F P=106> [Article by Cesar Chaman Alarcon] </F>
  [Text] Bagua Grande -- Bertrand Dufourcq, secretary general 
of the French Foreign Ministry [title as published], said here 
yesterday that important French business groups are interested 
in investing fresh capital in Peru, especially in the areas of 
mining, oil, and tourism. 
  He added that one factor of interest to French investors is 
the process of economic stabilization that Peru has experienced 
for approximately two years. 
  Dufourcq said: "My country recognizes that the government of 
President Alberto Fujimori is carrying out a courageous policy, 
which often has social consequences, but we are convinced that 
Peru is on the right path." 
  He then noted that in the mining field, French investors are 
gathering information on the gold mines in the Peruvian mountain 
range with a view to investment in the very near future, and 
that some contracts for oil exploitation had already been signed 
with the government. 
  Regarding tourism, Dufourcq said he is aware that an 
important French group is studying the possibility of investing 
in the construction of a hotel infrastructure in our country. 
  He added: "Peru has a richness and diversity in its natural 
environment as do very few countries in the world, and therefore 
has all the necessary conditions for developing tourism." 
  He also noted that France, as Peru's top creditor, is 
fulfilling a very important role in the process of renegotiating 
the Peruvian foreign debt. 
  He added: "This cooperation effort is part of the financing 
we provide for social development projects, especially in 
running water and sewer systems in the poor districts of Lima, 
in Cusco, and in the northern part of the country." 
  Dufourcq made these comments after visiting schools in the 
provinces of Jaen (Cajamarca) and Utcubamba (Amazonas) with 
President Alberto Fujimori.

  [Text] Montevideo, 27 May (AFP-NA) -- Government sources 
reported that the Argentine and Uruguayan Armies agreed this 
week to maintain a "fluid exchange" between the schools in each 
country that will train Latin American officers assigned to UN 
peacekeeping forces. 
  Two colonels and two lieutenant colonels, representatives of 
the Argentine and Uruguayan Armies, concluded several days of 
meetings at Army Headquarters in Montevideo. During the 
meetings, they agreed to "cooperate between the two Armies" to 
train the future UN officers. 
  The agreement put an end to a dispute between Argentina's 
Carlos Menem and Uruguay's Luis Alberto Lacalle, who were 
disputing the seat of an eventual regional school for the Blue 
Helmets' military training. 
  The agreement includes the bilateral exchange of military 
trainers who will offer training courses to the Latin American 
Armed Forces officers assigned to UN peace missions. The 
training courses will take place in both Argentina and Uruguay. 
  The Uruguayan Armed Forces have a unit of more than 1,100 
men 
at the service of the United Nations in Mozambique, Western 
Sahara, Cambodia, Kashmir, and on the Egyptian-Israeli border, 
while Argentina has 1,200 men in UN Blue Helmet units.

  [Text] Montevideo, 28 May (EFE) -- Uruguayans will have the 
opportunity to vote on 29 November 1994 in the national 
elections and also for three constitutional reform projects. Two 
of these projects were made known this weekend. 
  The first project, which was approved by an ample majority 
in 
Congress, foresees national elections being held separate from 
municipal elections. 
  Of the two other projects, which were promoted by teachers 
unions through the popular mechanism of obtaining 10 percent of 
the signatures of those who figure on the election lists, one 
calls for a clause in the Constitution to oblige the government 
to set aside 27 percent of the national budget, or 4.3 percent 
of the GDP, for the educational sector. 
  The second seeks to prevent any modifications to the pension 
and social security system, which is now in the hands of the 
state, to avoid future privatizations. 
  If the proposal to improve the educational sector receives 
the required 1.2 million votes, the budget for education will 
increase from $380 million to $600 million. 
  The project for reforming the educational sector obtained 
430,000 signatures, which must now be checked by the Electoral 
Court, while the pension and social security project obtained 
280,000. 
  A minimum of 230,000 valid signatures of citizens registered 
to vote, 10 percent of those who are registered at the electoral 
offices in accordance with the Constitution, are needed to 
request a constitutional reform. 
  The presentation was made on the last valid day and 
Electoral 
Court President Juan Carlos Furest has said the court "now faces 
a dramatic situation due to the volume of last minute projects 
for constitutional reform." 
  The Electoral Court must now organize the election, and 
control and verify some 700,000 signatures. 
  Furest explained that these tasks surpass the physical 
capability of the Electoral Court. 
  He said the 1,500 Electoral Court employees have just 
finished the slow process of registering new voters and are now 
purging the registers of the balloting places where more than 2 
million Uruguayans will vote on 19 November. 
  The cost of the elections, which has been estimated at $5 
million, will increase due to the simultaneous voting. 
  Furest stressed that the Electoral Court will carry out its 
task and comply with the Constitution, but added that it will 
not be easy to double the work of the employees, who are working 
between 10 and 12 hours a day.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Venezuelan President Rafael </F>
Caldera by reporter Marcel Granier in Caracas on 29 March; first 
two paragraphs are an introduction] 
  [Text] President Rafael Caldera told Marcel Granier during 
an interview at the Radio Caracas Television Studios on 29 March 
that those banks which have received financial assistance from 
the Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund [Fogade] no 
longer belong to bankers, but, rather, to the country, and they 
will have to be rehabilitated in order to be privatized. 
  Certain aspects of the lengthy dialogue between President 
Caldera and Granier follow: 
  [Granier] President Caldera, when Venezuelans elected you as 
president of the Republic for a second time, the country was 
experiencing a serious political, economic, and social crisis. 
During the short time that has passed since you took office, we 
have observed a growing stabilization in the political arena. 
The instability, confusion, dislike, and contempt that have 
existed regarding politics have begun to vanish, and one senses 
the people have regained pride in their basic institutions. 
There is a revival of trust in that area. When will we be able 
to see the same stabilization we have witnessed in the political 
arena in the economic and social areas? 
  [Caldera] We are on the way. I am determined and convinced I 
will achieve it once the puzzle is assembled, but this country 
is in the midst of chaos; everyone is looking after his own 
interests. I want to urge my friends and colleagues at the 
university: Show the country that you feel as a part of 
Venezuela, that your problem is part of a larger problem that 
affects the entire country, that you are willing to make 
sacrifices, as we all should, to get the country going. 
  The economic situation has been, undoubtedly, on the front 
burner. First, it was Banco Latino's intervention, which, 
despite being a very serious problem, was resolved, and 
satisfactorily, according to many. The intervention of Banco 
Latino has unveiled the fact that other banks were facing 
problems as well, that a systemic crisis was occurring. Those 
banks that receive financial assistance from Fogade are actually 
obtaining money the Central Bank withdraws from its reserves. 
The Central Bank gives these funds to Fogade, which, in turn, 
gives it to the banks, and rumors claim that bankers receive the 
money, which is untrue. These funds are given to depositors, 
savers, those who have suffered anxiety similar to that 
experienced by those involved in the Banco Latino case. Those 
people numbered almost as many depositors as those affected by 
the intervention of Banco Latino. 
  Incidentally, I would like to insist on this explanation. 
That money has not been given away; it was given to the banks in 
exchange for their shares, their assets, and their properties. 
Those banks no longer belong to bankers but, rather, to the 
country. The country will have to rehabilitate them in order to 
see whether it privatizes or sells them, and whatever profits 
are made from their sale will help reimburse the Central Bank 
for its loan to Fogade. 
  It has truly been a serious situation, but, fortunately, it 
is stabilizing. I have met, almost daily, with the Central Bank 
Board of Directors, discussing the problem over with them, and I 
have told them of my decision to take any necessary measures, 
because I am willing to put the country's interest above all. 
They have talked about it, studied it, and made various 
suggestions, and so far we believe the current system is heading 
toward a balance. 
  [Granier] It has been, undoubtedly, a significant move. Many 
are blaming the exacerbation of the problem on a lack of 
coordination of your economic team. Is that why you have made 
the cabinet changes the media published yesterday? 
  [Caldera] It is natural for a government team to be 
organized 
in accordance with its party. Adjustments may be implemented 
later, but a government team arrives with built-in machinery. 
  The English, for instance, have a proposed cabinet so that 
when the opposition assumes power it does so accompanied by its 
entire team. This is not the case here. We had a true 
convergence, and due to the participation of people from various 
trends, we have had to incorporate different views. Thus, the 
machinery has been organized, adapted, and the system has been 
established. The government team has worked hard. The problem is 
that we received this country in an extremely poor condition. I 
do not believe it would be constructive or prudent for the 
people if we were to persist in telling them of the disarray we 
have encountered. 
  Do you believe I am like Perez? 
  [Granier] Not at all, thank God. 
  [Caldera] Commander Chavez is the one person who you should 
not confuse me with Perez. I am not interested nor do I believe 
it is appropriate for me to engage in a discussion with him. I 
have given him every assurance for his return to civilian life 
and for him to use all the rights he has as a Venezuelan. If 
this is the way he feels, fine; he has the right to say so even 
though what he says many times borders on what the laws 
tolerate. Anyway, it is best for the country to hear him and for 
the country to begin seeing things the way they really are. It 
is best for the country to begin realizing who is who, how 
people think, and what they want. 
  [Granier] It has been said one cause of the economic problem 
is the many and contradictory statements the government 
spokesmen are making about it. Will the cabinet change mean the 
government will have only one economic spokesman? 
  [Caldera] According to the law, the Finance Ministry is the 
center of the government's economic policy. Dr. Julio Sosa is 
the government's most authorized authority in economic matters. 
Julio's full name is Julio Sosa Rodriguez. Somebody has said we 
are cousins, because I am Caldera Rodriguez. There is no kinship 
between us or between us and the Rodriguez relatives of Carlos 
Andres Perez. 
  We cannot avoid cabinet members speaking to the media at 
various activities. I have occasionally noticed this; some have 
different ideas, different points of view, and we have been 
working on this. This is why I am receiving reports from all the 
ministers at least once a week and from certain ministers 
several times a week. I have done this in compliance with a 
commitment, because I think the president, as the country's 
manager, must manage his government team. I have done this to 
create, to build a common position in the government. There have 
been difficulties, and I have not achieved a perfect situation, 
but I think we are marching in that direction. 
  [Granier] Currency exchange stability is very important for 
the economic stability we all want, but there are two other 
matters on which I would like for you to comment. Venezuela 
urgently needs investments, and they will be coming, basically, 
from abroad. To make changes possible, Venezuela needs programs 
of social assistance; that is, there are people who are more 
negatively affected when the value of the dollar rises from 120 
to 160 bolivares. The economic recession that exists due to the 
hike in the value of the dollar, the drop in imports, and the 
reduction in oil exports has negatively affected economic 
growth. The impact of this situation is more severe on certain 
people more than others. What social assistance plans or 
programs does your government have? 
  [Caldera] I will begin by saying there is no single week 
during which I fail to receive the visit of one, two, or more 
foreign investors who come to tell me of their plans to invest 
in Venezuela. I would like to see Venezuelan investors come to 
me in the same number as the foreign investors. 
  We have opened some doors. The Law for Construction of Works 
Using the Concessions System is most important, as acknowledged 
by the many people who are connected with the construction 
industry or the economy. This opens the doors for important 
public works that the state cannot carry out now and that need 
to be concluded, and this is why it is necessary to take 
advantage of investments. Those who use services are prepared to 
pay for them. Tolls on highways will be a heavy burden, but the 
people are willing to pay, because they will get where they are 
going quicker, more comfortably, and will save on fuel and car 
wear. For example, how long has it been since the opening of the 
Romulo Betancour Highway in the east? 
  We are again promoting the Program on Equipping 
Neighborhoods 
and Public Housing. This neighborhood program is very 
interesting, because in some of those neighborhoods there are 
houses built by the townspeople with great efforts, homes that 
are comfortable with fairly good amenities but without public 
services. There are no streets, no water, no sewage, and no 
telephones. We are trying to create awareness and the 
possibility of the communities living decently. 
  I realize that this drama that is over--I think it is, 
fortunately, over this matter of the dollar and the exchange 
rate--has produced, due to devaluation, another process of 
inflation and that this directly affects the poor sectors. We 
have to face that. I am prepared to make all the necessary 
efforts, serious efforts. I do not want to tell lies. I do not 
want to announce things that will not be carried out.

  [Text] Asdrubal Batista, Reform of the National Economy 
minister, on the night of 30 May submitted his irrevocable 
resignation from the post he occupies, because he disagrees with 
some changes in the economic policies that are being analyzed. 
Vicente Briceno has the story: 
  [Begin Briceno recording] It seems the resignation of 
Batista, who was responsible for devising short-, mid-, and 
long-term economic strategies, is because of alleged 
disagreements with Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez, who 
has steered the economic path toward positions Batista refuses 
to accept. 
  It was known the Executive Branch will not replace Dr. 
Batista, because it is believed he achieved most of the tasks 
President Rafael Caldera assigned to him. One such task was to 
draft a report on the prospects of the Venezuelan Corporation of 
Guayana. 
  Due to this situation, the economic expert reportedly 
refused 
to attend the questioning session scheduled for 1 June at the 
National Congress. The Miraflores Palace could not confirm the 
official report on Minister Batista's resignation. However, 
unofficial spokesmen reported it as fact. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from Miraflores Palace; from the </F>
"Union Radio News" newscast] 
  [Text] As we have reported, everything seems to indicate 
that President Rafael Caldera was prompted to replace Venezuelan 
Investment Fund [FIV] Minister Abdon Vivas Teran for failing to 
sell Aeropostal through the bidding process. 
  Fernando Egana, deputy minister of the Secretariat of the 
Presidency, has admitted that the chief of state has made this 
decision, because he wants to accelerate the process of 
privatization. He has added the former minister has established 
the bases for this policy and the government will develop it: 
  [Begin recording] [Egana] He has established solid and 
important bases, and the government will continue his efforts on 
such bases. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Is there anything concrete in this 
regard? 
  [Egana] A plan of privatization is already under way. 
  [Reporter] What is in store for Vivas? 
  [Egana] The president of the Republic will decide. 
  [Reporter] It was said the first attempt at privatization 
has 
failed. Will changes be made? Will a new element be introduced 
to make it more effective? 
  [Egana] Using the bases already established, the government 
will try to make greater efforts to attract foreign investments 
that are needed at this time. [end recording] 
  When asked whether the MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] will 
have a greater role in the government in view of the changes, 
Egana has said the country has achieved greater participation 
during the administration of President Caldera.

newscast; passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] One of the first new ministers to comment was Ciro 
Zaa, transport and communications minister. He pledged to wage 
an all-out struggle against administrative corruption at the 
Transport and Communications Ministry, adding that will be one 
of the first tasks he will undertake as minister. 
  [Zaa] "I also want to announce that I will invite the deans 
of the engineering schools to work together to vindicate 
national engineering by solving the problem of the black stain 
[mancha negra]." 
  Carlos Bernandez, the new state minister and president of 
the 
Venezuelan Investment Fund, has affirmed the government's 
commitment to devise a clear and extensive process of 
privatization with the participation of national and 
international investors. He has rejected the prevailing 
arguments to avoid privatization of the airline Aeropostal 
Venezolana, because, according to him, all airlines can be 
privatized. 
  [Bernandez] "I don't believe there may be reasons not to 
privatize anything. I think we must analyze the possibility of 
privatizing all enterprises in the state's hands; moreover, when 
there is talk of privatization, sometimes the very term is not 
necessarily clear. What we must do is debureaucratize the state." 
  Meanwhile, Development Minister Alberto Poletto has 
announced 
he will officialize on 1 June a new 90-day extension of the 
freeze of medicine prices but, rather, with a moderate 
adjustment taking into consideration social circumstances and 
the rate of inflation. Poletto has said he will strongly fight 
speculation, adding he will use all legal means to apply severe 
measures; nevertheless, he made it clear there will be no price 
controls. 
  [Poletto] "We must differentiate between price increases 
stemming from economic adjustments, such as the process of 
devaluation, and those derived from speculation by the private 
sector. I will strongly act against the latter and will try to 
do all I can to prevent this from happening." 
  We have also received reports from the Presidential Palace 
stressing the restructuring of Inavi [National Housing 
Institute]. 
  Francisco Gonzalez, acting urban development minister, has 
announced Inavi will be reorganized to make it play an important 
role in consolidating and equipping neighborhoods throughout the 
country. 
  [Gonzalez] "I believe Inavi has a fundamental role to play 
in 
supporting the establishment of new regional housing institutes 
in all states and regions; this will permit new housing 
institutes to organize themselves under standardized criteria, 
thus avoiding the creation of ill-conceived institutes and 
additional disorder in this process." 
  Alfredo Gruber, the new president of the Venezuelan Guayana 
Corporation, has made statements favoring [words indistinct] 
strategic, similar to those signed in the oil industry. The 
high-ranking official has explained he will analyze each case 
that requires the participation of the private sector in order 
to stimulate and promote the various industrial sectors of the 
Venezuelan Guayana Corporation affiliates. 
  [Gruber] "After conducting an analysis upon the president's 
request, we must implement the recommendations that are in the 
country's best interests." 
  Finally, Luis Carlos Palacios, incoming Cordiplan [Central 
Office of Coordination and Planning] minister, has said the 
adjustment in exchange recently implemented by the Central Bank 
of Venezuela will reduce the fiscal deficit to zero. 
  [Palacios] "The government's initial fiscal deficit for this 
year was set at 2 percent of the gross domestic product. Now, 
with the exchange rate, I am under the impression the 
government's fiscal deficit will disappear, and a quasifiscal 
deficit in the monetary area will appear. I will work to 
evaluate the annual operating program."

<F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The National Committee of the Social Christian Party 
[COPEI] today analyzed the cabinet changes made over the weekend 
by President Rafael Caldera. The COPEI leadership believes the 
country's problems will not be solved with simple cabinet 
changes. 
  The National Committee's conclusion was announced by Acting 
Deputy Secretary General Freddy Delgado Dalo who said that it is 
necessary to establish a coherent policy. 
  [Begin Delgado recording] The National Committee believes 
that simple cabinet changes, in this case by rooking [enroque], 
will not solve the country's problems. The country is demanding 
the definition of policies and coherence in government policies, 
not the substitution of some men for others. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Segundo Melendez, leader of the Movement Toward 
Socialism [MAS], said that these changes are appropriate. 
  [Begin Melendez recording] As you know, we expressed our 
views on this last week. The decision made by the president is 
aimed at something we believe to be essential, and that is the 
need to create coherence and unity in the economic cabinet. This 
is very important for conducting the overall economic policy. 
[end recording] 
  Democratic Action Party leader Pedro Tabata Guzman has said 
that it is necessary to see how effective these changes really 
were. 
  [Begin Tabata recording] With this rooking move made by the 
president, all he did was create expectations. For some time now 
we have been saying that there was much incoherence among those 
who formed President Caldera's economic cabinet. I believe we 
must now wait to see if things change. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, the Radical Cause Party believes that the changes 
have been appropriate. This was announced by party leader Pablo 
Medina. 
  [Begin Medina recording] Some appointments seem to be 
appropriate. We believe that naming Pompeyo Marquez as head of 
the government's social programs is quite appropriate. Also 
appropriate is the appointment of Ciro Zaa as transportation and 
communications minister since the former minister's actions had 
been questioned by former Deputy Minister Rafael Iribarren. 
However, in general terms, we do believe the bankers have 
greater control of this cabinet. The fact that Julio Sosa 
remains as finance minister, that Carlos Bernardez was appointed 
president of the Venezuelan Investment Fund, and that Gustavo 
Roosen remains in an overly privileged position, indicates that 
the country's bankers have made progress in controlling the 
cabinet. Despite this, some of the changes made do seem 
appropriate. [end recording] 
  However, National Convergence believes that the growing 
number of bankers in the cabinet has a clear purpose. This was 
said by National Convergence Deputy Jose Miguel Uzcategui. 
  [Begin Uzcategui recording] There is a financial crisis, and 
the least that can be done is to reinforce the financial sector. 
If there is need to create an environment of trust in our 
economy and the future of our currency, then appointing 
experienced men, successful men--these men have not failed in 
their profession--is positive. Therefore, I do believe it is a 
positive move to create this image of credibility. All of them 
have been involved in banking activities with substantial and 
excellent banks. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The social cabinet installed on Thursday at the 
Miraflores Presidential Palace will benefit approximately 5 
million persons who live in extreme poverty, a matter of concern 
for the national government. This was announced by Family 
Minister Mercedes Pulido de Briceno when she installed the 
social cabinet. The minister indicated that the situation of 
unemployment, inflation, and shortages of basic products demand 
an expeditious and permanent social policy to benefit the needy 
sectors. 
  The minister highlighted the importance of the social 
cabinet 
that will meet every Wednesday at the Miraflores Presidential 
Palace to discuss social aid programs targeted for families with 
scarce economic resources. Pulido de Briceno said that with this 
new program not only the social sector but also the economic 
sector will be taken into account. In terms of this, she 
highlighted the use of generic drugs by the population and price 
control to avoid rampant prices hikes. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, Nancy Montero de Sanchez, new president of the 
National Institute of Minors, was sworn in by President Rafael 
Caldera. Montero de Sanchez announced the implementation of a 
violence prevention program for minors who are social outcasts 
as a result of the crisis the nation is experiencing. [passage

  [Text] Economic guarantees could be restored this week once 
the executive promulgates the Law on Conspicuous Consumption and 
Wholesales, Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez has said. He 
appeared before the bicameral commission specially appointed by 
Congress to study Decree 51. 
  Julio Sosa Rodriguez explained that the suspension of 
guarantees was justified while the juridical basis to eliminate 
the value added tax was determined. However, with this week's 
promulgation of the Law on Conspicuous Consumption and 
Wholesales, the intention of the government is to reinstate 
economic guarantees. 
  In light of lawmakers' questions on whether the speculation 
unleashed by the increase in dollar prices would prompt 
authorities to maintain the measure allowing the executive to 
implement price control actions, Sosa Rodriguez asserted there 
are mechanisms that can be implemented. He added these 
mechanisms do not have anything to do with the suspension of 
economic guarantees. 
  The minister insisted the executive will use all resources 
before implementing foreign exchange controls, because this 
measure would not benefit the country. Sosa Rodriguez expressed 
he hopes the situation will normalize with the implementation of 
the new foreign exchange sales provision adopted by the Central 
Bank. He stated there are no reasons to justify an uncontrolled 
increase in U.S. currency. 
  The minister announced he will travel on Thursday to the 
United States, where he will meet with representatives of the 
IMF and the banking sector to explain Venezuela's situation, to 
try to restore confidence among international economic sectors. 
  He hinted at the possibility the government may present in 
the short term a compensatory bond plan for salaries and social 
programs, which would benefit the poor. Nevertheless, he did not 
make specific announcements because these measures are now under 
study at the Ministries of Development and Labor.

  [Text] Gustavo Roosen, presidential commissioner for reform 
of the financial system, met with President Rafael Caldera, 
Central Bank President Antonio Casas, Deputy Finance Minister 
Luis Javier Grisanti, and Andres Caldera, minister of the 
Secretariat Presidency, at Miraflores Palace on 28 May. They 
analyzed the aspects of sales of foreign currency in view of the 
dollar's gradual decline in relation to the bolivar. 
  Roosen said the reduction in the price of U.S. currency will 
establish a fair rate of exchange regarding the bolivar, 
according to the developments of the foreign exchange market. 
  Meanwhile, Roosen commented on the subsidies granted by 
Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] to 
certain financial institutions. He warned that if the loaned 
money is not repaid on schedule, namely 7 June, these banks will 
be transferred to state hands. 
  [Begin Roosen recording] We can coordinate theo 
administration of banks' finances in order to cover the 
deficiencies a bank may have at a given time, because we will 
all be shareholders. Banco Latino has a significant cash 
surplus, which has been exchanged for zero-coupon bonds. Banco 
Latino does not have any limitations; on the contrary, it is 
ready to sell these bonds to support its fellow banks owned by 
Fogade. This will permit them to generate--what I have heard so 
many times--[words indistinct] short of financial assistance, as 
part of the financial system without resorting to the 
zero-coupon market. We have been working on this topic this 
week, and the principle of autonomous financial management for 
Fogade is being consolidated, empowering it to supervise and 
take action regarding the banks they will own and supervise.

  [Text] Last night a meeting was held at the Miraflores 
Presidential Palace, where there was word of what BCV [Central 
Bank of Venezuela] President Antonio Casas Gonzalez called "the 
good news" of yesterday's "great tendency for foreign exchange 
to stabilize." Bankers offered their support to the present 
system because the BCV promised to supply currency according to 
market offers, making rational use of international reserves, 
which are at an "adequate level." 
  Tuesday's increase in the dollar exchange rate came as no 
surprise to the BCV, "because a free system was instituted." The 
BCV had to supply currency according to market offers; this is 
what it is all about. "We do not accept rumors of exchange 
control, because we are not thinking of this. International 
reserves are at an adequate level (did not mention the amount), 
which gives us sufficient flexibility to cover import needs and 
to face the exchange rate situation." 
  The BCV directorate hopes that yesterday's trend repeats 
itself in the next few days and that our currency finally 
stabilizes. The directorate added that businesses and people who 
purchased dollars over the past few weeks unloaded them in view 
of the possibility that exchange rates could drop and they 
"might lose." The BCV directorate is aware of an important 
transaction among three banks involving $4 million. Casas 
Gonzalez affirmed that there should be trust in the bolivar, 
which is backed by the BCV. "There are no great dangers at this 
moment; we need to change our attitude and not speculate." 
  Regarding interest rates, Casas Gonzalez said that it is 
impossible to reduce them with the expectation of inflation; "if 
we do, the flight of capital increases. It is an illusion to say 
that interest rates can be reduced. One cannot stop dollars from 
leaving or attract investments without real positive interests." 
We have ruled out the so-called solidarity commitment to reduce 
the productive sectors' active rates, which was proposed by 
[Commissioner for Financial Reforms Gustavo] Roosen. "This does 
not mean that we agree with the situation, but all countries 
defend their currency with this mechanism." 
  He added that the "crawling peg" [preceding words in 
English] 
system was given up on 1 May because it was no longer effective. 
This is no time to think there is a perfect system "when we are 
living a situation such as this where there is a crisis of 
confidence." 
  We seek a balance between availability and demand. Reserves 
are used as cautiously as possible. While supplying the market 
to stabilize the bolivar, "the struggle to maintain reserves 
continues being a priority, but, along with reserves, we want 
stability. We cannot change the currency market scheme 
overnight." 
  Regarding [Finance Minister Julio] Sosa Rodriguez's 
statement 
that the dollar exchange should be set at 150 bolivares, Casas 
Gonzalez said that this is determined by the market. "We hope it 
will be more or less this amount. Some technicians have 
estimated this, but I cannot give an exact amount, because I do 
not know what psychological factor will affect the rate." 
  We know that there is a back order and that this is why we 
have to supply the market to cover part of it, but there is also 
much artificial demand." [New BCV director] Domingo Maza Zavala 
was the most notable absentee. The finance minister came out of 
the meeting satisfied and said "tomorrow (today) I will meet 
with the IMF president."

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from Miraflores Palace; from the </F>
"Union Radio News" newscast] 
  [Text] According to Antonio Casas Gonzalez, president of 
the Central Bank of Venezuela, the U.S. dollar's downward trend 
is making it very unlikely to implement controls on foreign 
exchange. Casas has said that although he respects Dr. Maza 
Zavala's opinion in this regard, he opposes Maza's proposed 
formula, because the nonexistence of a parallel market with the 
application of the auction system will lead to a single 
bolivar-dollar exchange rate. 
  Casas briefed President Rafael Caldera on the progress of 
the 
foreign exchange market during the course of the week, following 
implementation of a new exchange system. He has said the U.S. 
dollar has been revalued, but there is a downward trend on 
dollar prices. 
  The Central Bank president has agreed with Finance Minister 
Julio Sosa Rodriguez that the exchange rate could ultimately be 
set at 150 bolivares per dollar. 
  [Begin recording] [Casas] I would say the exchange rate 
could 
be set at approximately 150 bolivares per dollar. I would not 
dare quote an exact figure, because there is a psychological 
demand that still exists, but this demand has been reduced. You 
can now see there are no lines at currency exchange facilities, 
but we do not know yet how much of that psychological demand.... 
  [Unidentified reporter, interrupting] Will the.... 
  [Casas interrupting] That is not a real demand; therefore, 
the demand must continue to go down. 
  [Reporter] Will the demand for the U.S. dollar continue to 
decrease? 
  [Casas] We think so, because there is still some 
psychological demand. 
  [Reporter] Will this system [words indistinct]? 
  [Casas] Yes, it has yielded very positive results. First, 
because the exchange rate has declined, and second, because it 
has taken us to a single exchange rate, which is very open. 
  [Reporter] Are we moving toward a unique rate of exchange? 
  [Casas] Obviously, as can be seen in the graphs published 
recently. 
  [Reporter] How long will this process take? 
  [Casas] We have practically reached a single exchange rate. 
If you see the curves.... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] [Words indistinct] stabilization? 
  [Casas] The important thing is stabilization. A country 
without a stable currency.... [pauses] Venezuelans must have 
confidence in our currency. This country has much to give. [end 
recording] 
  The fact of the matter is the government and directors of 
the 
Central Bank of Venezuela are optimistic and confident about the 
complete normalization of the foreign exchange market.

<F P=106> [Report by Alicia Aguilar] </F>
  [Text] Eleven regional industrial and three sectorial 
chambers have agreed to declare a total emergency and initiate 
progressive, "increasingly vigorous" actions to make commercial 
banks aware of the urgent need to restructure and refinance the 
Small- and Medium-Scale Industry's [Pymi] debt. 
  The actions are sponsored by the chambers of Caracas and the 
States of Miranda, Anzoategui, Aragua, Barinas, Carabobo, 
Merida, Nueva Esparta, Tachira, and Trujillo, as well as the 
industrial chambers of the footwear, manufacturing, and plastics 
industries, whose registered enterprises suffer acute production 
stagnation, loss of investment, and decapitalization problems. 
  For this purpose, the chambers are backed by Corpoindustria, 
an organization that announced its willingness to present in the 
Congress an Emergency Refinancing Bill to take the sector out of 
the stagnation it suffers. 
  According to a report by the VeneConsultants firm for 
Conindustria, the industry's profits have been lower than the 
amounts paid in interest rates. The problems thus resulted in 
some prompt, radical positions, which urge protection for the 
financial system while the production system is on the verge of 
collapse. 
  During a recent meeting of a group of important industrial 
chambers and associations, the financial assistance provided by 
FOGADE [Guarantee Fund for the Protection of Bank Deposits] to 
"compensate for the irregular handling of the depositors' money" 
was seriously questioned. Some of the strong expressions heard 
went like this: "While we had to compete for exports, the banks 
got financial assistance." "While the doors of financing are 
closed for us, banks are benefited by the Zero Coupon." "We 
cannot obtain dollars, but the banks can obtain them 
exclusively." 
  The industrialists reported that Banking Association 
President Jose Bouza Izquierdo's pledge that compulsive 
collection would not be affected is not being made good. This is 
the case for the footwear industry, whose representative 
organizations, Cavenic and Anpmicals, say the indebtedness index 
in the sector tripled in the past few months, thus increasing 
the final cost of the finished product, whose price increases 
"without receiving any bank assistance. Quite the contrary, they 
are the recipients of stronger and more pressing actions from 
the banks." 
  According to Deputy Development Minister Warner Corrales 
Leal, the government is also concerned with the problem. He said 
the Executive Branch is waiting for "the banks to demonstrate 
the same expeditiousness in solving these problems." Frankly, he 
said, the ministry would like to receive from the banks clearer 
signals that they are indeed concerned and that they are doing 
everything possible, just as the government is doing. 
  The ministry's criticism is shared by Corpoindustria, where 
the problem is seen to become more complex with the rise in the 
price of the dollar because already raw material suppliers are 
quoting prices in foreign currency and shortening payment terms. 
  Manuel Gallegos, Corpoindustria acting president, has 
reported that FIV [Venezuelan Investment Fund] is considering 
negotiating a $100-million loan with Citybank, a loan which will 
make it possible for Corpoindustria to refinance part of Pymi's 
debt with this organization, which amounts to 7 billion 
bolivares, of which 1.7 billion bolivares are overdue. Also, a 
joint action by Corpoindustria, Foncrel, Sogamoi, and Banco 
Industrial de Venezuela is being prepared to create a bloc for 
financing and industrial support.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 31 
May. 
  Approximately 25,000 enterprises in Zulia State have been 
thrown into a recession because of the latest fluctuations of 
the bolivar. One business sector representative explained that 
the dollar auction mechanism is hurting Venezuelan businessmen. 
He said inflation and the lack of imported supplies are two 
short-term consequences of the instability in the exchange rate. 
He predicted there may be long-term mass layoffs and company 
closures as a result of the economic decline. (Caracas Union 
Radio Network in Spanish 0200 GMT 22 May 94) 
  Energy and Mines Minister Erwin Jose Arrieta has announced 
Venezuela will obtain an additional $120 million as a result of 
higher prices on the international oil market. He explained that 
higher oil prices resulted in $70 million in additional revenues 
last month. Arrieta attributed the increase in oil prices to 
temporary conditions, such as repairs in North Sea oil 
facilities, Nigeria's domestic situation, the conflict in Yemen, 
and increased consumption by industrialized nations. (Caracas 
Union Radio Network in Spanish 2200 GMT 26 May 94) 
  Venezuelan exports to Andean Group countries increased by 
40.6 percent in the first quarter of the year, going from $195 
million in the first quarter of 1993 to $275 million in 1994, 
according to estimates by the Cartagena Agreement Board. 
According to the figures, Venezuela replaced Colombia as the 
largest exporter in interregional trade. The estimated value of 
interregional trade amounted to $698 million. (Caracas EL 
NACIONAL in Spanish 27 May 94 p E-7)

  [Text] Caracas, 28 May (EFE) -- The Venezuelan Government 
has put an end to the uncertainty surrounding the future of 
state-owned power companies by announcing today that, starting 
in September, these companies will be privatized. 
  Eduardo Calero, manager of the electrical sector of the 
Venezuelan Investment Fund (FIV), said that initially the 
Central Plant and Enelven-Enelco [expansion unknown] companies 
will be auctioned, and in early 1995 the process will continue 
with the privatization of two other regional companies. 
  The transfer of the power companies to the private sector 
has 
been planned for over four years, but during that period various 
factors emerged--most of them political--which prevented the 
process from materializing. 
  According to Calero, the government no longer considers 
privatization as a means of reducing the size of government but 
as "an immediate financial necessity," prompted by the acute 
economic crisis the country is experiencing, which has become 
worse because of the accelerated devaluation of the national 
currency. 
  The FIV official also announced that within the short term 
power rates will be revised because companies in the region have 
been seriously affected by the devaluation of the Venezuelan 
bolivar with regard to the U.S. dollar. 
  Products, imported raw materials, and the payment of debts 
abroad now pose a considerable problem for the power companies, 
which must pay their commitments in dollars, while their rates 
are fixed in a currency that has been devaluated by 30 percent 
over the past two months, Calero said. 
  In any event, he explained, the cost of the devaluation will 
not be directly transferred to the rates; instead, he said, "the 
increase in rates will depend on the extent to which each power 
company is willing to assume part of the expense caused by the 
weakening of Venezuela's currency."

<F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Defense Minister General Rafael Angel Montero 
Revette has said certain officers involved in the 1992 coup 
attempts will be promoted to the next rank on 5 July after the 
head of state approved the list proposed by the qualifying board 
and the four branches of the military institution. 
  [Reporter Vicente Briceno] Gen. Montero Revette has made the 
announcement from Miraflores Palace, disclosing the decision by 
the president with whom he met for approximately three hours to 
review the military promotions that will be submitted to 
Congress in the coming days. 
  Through the Senate's Committee of Defense, Congress will 
study the appropriate files. Montero has reported the approval 
of the following promotions: 30 brigade generals, 10 of which 
are in the Army, six in the Air Force, eight in the National 
Guard, and six Navy rear admirals. 
  Also up for promotion are 120 colonels, broken down as 
follows: 40 in the Army, 25 in the aviation division, 35 in the 
National Guard, and 20 ship of the line captains in the Navy. 
  As the minister explained, the promotions to the ranks of 
vice admirals and division general were left pending for next 
week because President Rafael Caldera was unable to review them. 
Montero has said that based on a decision by the president, a 
group of officers from the four branches who participated in the 
1992 coup attempts will also be promoted on that same date. 
  [Begin Montero recording] These officers, primarily from the 
Army, rejoined the force more than two years ago and are working 
in troop commands in different posts of the organization. They 
have the same rights and duties of other officers. For that 
reason, those entitled to a promotion are evaluated. He may or 
may not be promoted, but not due to the coup attempts, because 
that is over for us. [end recording] 
  [Briceno] The defense minister has added that, like the 
officers who participated in the 1992 coup attempts, the 
enlistees who joined them in these actions will also be 
promoted. President Caldera has dropped the charges against 
these soldiers. 
  Commenting on the return to the country of General Francisco 
Viconti, Montero has said President Caldera, as Armed Forces 
commander in chief, and the Defense Ministry have felt his 
return to military active duty is impossible; for that reason, 
he will be discharged.

  [Text] Brussels, 31 May (NOTIMEX) -- Cuba has sent to the 
Belgian authorities a written commitment to respect the human 
rights of the 113 Cubans who invaded that country's diplomatic 
headquarters in Havana. The two parties agreed that there should 
be a peaceful evacuation. 
  The Belgian Foreign Ministry, through its spokesman, told 
NOTIMEX that it had received a message from Cuban authorities 
committing themselves to not persecuting asylum seekers after 
they leave the embassy. Belgium made it clear it had no 
intention of receiving [recibir] the Cubans and called for a 
"swift and humane" solution to the problem that would restore 
tranquillity to the diplomatic headquarters in Havana, which is 
made up of five officials. 
  One of the 114 refugees voluntarily left the Belgian 
diplomatic headquarters on Sunday evening and the police did not 
ask him to produce identification, the Spanish newspaper EL PAIS 
reported today. 
  The spokesman said Belgium will continue giving humanitarian 
aid to the asylum seekers, including 34 women and 24 children. 
Belgian authorities sent additional drinks and food to the Cuban 
refugees in the embassy.

  [Text] Havana, 31 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, an official 
source reported that some of the more than 100 people who are 
occupying the Belgian ambassador's residence in the Cuban 
capital refuse to leave the house despite the [words indistinct]. 
  The source told NOTIMEX that "there is a group that remains 
inflexible" in its position to request political asylum in 
Belgium. This is the first indication there are opposing 
opinions among the Cubans who are occupying Ambassador Paul 
Vermeirsch's house. 
  The source added that the exact number of members of the 
"inflexible" group remains unknown as of tonight, four days 
after the violent takeover of the residence. He also added that 
most of the people who occupied the house have maintained a 
"peaceful attitude." The source pointed out that, despite this 
situation, the Cuban and Belgian Governments continued to meet 
during the ordeal and affirmed their determination to resolve 
this situation by negotiation. 
  On 30 May, an exchange of talking points between the Foreign 
Relations Ministries of the two countries followed a number of 
meetings, during which Havana and Brussels concluded the 
occupation was "illegal." The two governments rejected the 
forceful occupation of the residence as a formula to negotiate 
the departure of Cubans and agreed that the members of the 
invading group should follow legal procedures. 
  It was learned in official Cuban circles on Tuesday [31 May] 
that the number of occupants is 22, including "about 30 women 
and 20 children." [figures as received] This figure contrasts 
with that of other sources, both local and official, which 
coincides with the number released by Belgian authorities of 114 
persons in all: 56 men, 34 women, and 24 minors. One man, who 
according to several sources left the building on his own accord 
Sunday night without being challenged by the police that guard 
the residence, must be subtracted from the total. 
  On Monday afternoon, and in front of Vermeirsch's residence, 
a Cuban Government official read through a loudspeaker an 
official communique urging the occupants to vacate the building 
and follow the legal procedures to leave the country. 
  The statement, of which the press had no copies, confirmed 
that the Cuban authorities will not take reprisals against those 
who started the incident, a government source reported. An 
official of the Foreign Ministry's International Press Center 
(CPI) said officials of the Central Committee of the Communist 
Party of Cuba confirmed the government position yesterday. 
  The source also disclosed that Ambassador Vermeirsch 
notified 
Cuban authorities that he had begun efforts to get the Red Cross 
to provide food, personal hygiene supplies, and other 
humanitarian aid for the house's occupants. 
  Cuba reiterated its willingness to take the necessary steps 
for this aid to be delivered to the residence and for the 
occupants to do the legal paperwork needed to leave the country, 
the source added. 
  The CPI official, who transmitted the government reports and 
information from the police unit in charge of protecting the 
residence to reporters, said the occupants are sleeping inside 
the house, on the terrace, and in the garden.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 31 May (DPA) -- The Dominican Armed 
Forces have seized 33 vehicles and a boat as they were preparing 
to take fuel and other goods to Haiti. Of the 33 vehicles, five 
trucks belong to Haitian merchants, and the remainder, made up 
of trucks, jeeps, and cars, belongs to Dominican citizens. All 
vehicles seized were taken to Armed Forces headquarters in Santo 
Domingo for investigation. 
  Regarding the boat, reports indicate that it was a barge 
carrying 800,000 gallons of diesel fuel and heading toward "Fort 
Liberte" in Haiti. According to the Armed Forces Ministry, 
sailors said it was heading north of Monte Cristi and that 
later, it turned toward the south, entering Haitian territorial 
waters. 
  Personnel on a Navy craft fired several shots, forcing the 
barge and its seven Dominican crewmen to head toward a Dominican 
port, where the men were arrested and the barge seized. Reports 
indicate that all these cases are under investigation.

  [Begin Lugo recording] We welcome any one who wants to come 
and visit us to see what the national situation is like. We ask 
him to be objective in his observations based on the general 
reality of our country and not based only on the events of a 
specific time span, to prevent this person -- or any other 
visitor -- from reaching conclusions that do not reflect the 
truth about the real situation we are experiencing here, both 
domestically and abroad. [end recording] 
  Most Mexicans are bothered by Robert Torricelli's presence. 
This is the same U.S. congressman who always opposed NAFTA and 
has even proposed even stricter and stronger border restrictions 
for immigrants, particularly Mexicans, to our northern 
neighbor's Congress. Important high-ranking officials and public 
leaders say Robert Torricelli is not welcome in Mexico, 
including former Mexican Foreign Minister Fernando Solana, a 
candidate for the Senate. 
  Fidel Velasquez, secretary general of the Confederation of 
Mexican Workers, said there is nothing lost because of the 
Torricelli visit. He said he is not violating national 
sovereignty with his statements. This happens in Mexico, 
because Mexico is a very generous nation. In any case, Don 
Fidel still is not very pleased with the visit.

<F P=106> [Report by Jesus Aranda] </F>
  [Text] Members of the Promoters of Solidarity with Cuba 
have taken over installations at the U.S. Embassy, displaying a 
casket containing a puppet of Uncle Sam and burning 
it, and they began staging a lightning demonstration 
against U.S. "imperialism" and Senator Robert Torricelli's 
presence in Mexico. 
  The grenadiers in charge of security around the U.S. 
installations did not know what to do; the protesters jumped 
over the huge chain-link fence located at the barrier in front 
of the embassy building. They were a mere meter and a half away 
from the door that accesses the embassy. 
  The appointment for media reporters presaged something very 
peculiar: "Two women will meet the reporter at 0930 at the 
Sanborns Restaurant to lead him to the place where the events 
will be staged." 
  At 1000 sharp, reporters followed the youths who were 
heading 
toward La Reforma Avenue; suddenly, a pickup truck 
stopped in front of the U.S. Embassy, and two youths quickly got 
out of the car and placed the casket with the effigy inside. 
  Members of the Promoters of Solidarity with Cuba appeared 
from many places and started chanting slogans against U.S. 
imperialism and Senator Torricelli: "The Zapatists burned the 
fax in which they were warned of your presence," they greeted 
him, whistling five times. 
  Following a minor incident in which certain drivers could 
not 
proceed by using the street parallel to La Reforma Avenue, 
traffic was completely halted. During this demonstration, which 
the group of youths called a "symbolic and peaceful" 
demonstration, members of the Promoter of Solidarity with Cuba 
such as Jorge Carrillo explained that this was not an act of 
provocation but, rather, a simple act protesting the meddling 
behavior of the U.S. Government in Cuba and the presence of 
Torricelli, against whom they wanted to enforce Article 33, that 
is, they wanted to expel him from the country as a persona 
non grata. The legislator was accused of meddling in 
Mexico's domestic affairs; this is why most of the slogans were 
aimed at him. 
  Meanwhile, Gustavo Hernandez Merida, second ranking official 
at the General Secretariat for Protection and Highways, spoke 
via radio to ask whether there was permission to stage this 
demonstration. There was a negative reply. He requested 
reinforcements, and minutes later, the 03021 and 03022 Patrols, 
whose agents remained on the lookout, arrived. 
  At 1025, the casket was dragged with a yellow chain, put 
atop 
the barrier, and left there "as a souvenir." Amid the billowing 
smoke emanating from the casket, the youths said goodbye to 
Torricelli by whistling five more times and quickly left the 
scene.

  [Text] Mexico City, 31 May (NOTIMEX) -- A police source has 
reported that one person was arrested and an unknown number were 
injured today during a clash between riot police and 
demonstrators demanding housing in Iztapalapa, in eastern Mexico 
City. According to the Road and Safety Secretariat [SGPyV], the 
incident occurred early this morning when policemen dispersed 
members of the so-called "Francisco Villa People's Front" 
[Frente Popular Francisco Villa] who were blocking an avenue 
with two buses. The SGPyV said nine policemen were injured in 
the clash; however, the source failed to mention the number of 
wounded demonstrators. The source also failed to mention how 
many riot policemen participated in the operation. Eyewitnesses 
calculated that there were approximately 500 riot policemen in 
the area. 
  The source added that when the riot police intervened, the 
demonstrators withdrew to a nearby school from where they hurled 
bottles, sticks, stones, and "Molotov" cocktails at the police, 
damaging several privately owned vehicles. 
  After the clash, the demonstrators occupied and destroyed 
the 
offices of two district attorneys and hurled stones at the 
policemen while demanding that their arrested leader be 
released. The arrested leader was released but another 
demonstrator was arrested, the police source added. The 
demonstrators failed in their attempt to [words indistinct] and 
broke windows. Among the injured were three riot policemen, who 
were intentionally hit by vehicles. The others were injured by 
"a rain of projectiles thrown at them," the source added.

<F P=106> [News conference by President Carlos Roberto Reina with </F>
domestic and foreign reporters and hosted by an unidentified 
moderator; at the Presidency in Tegucigalpa; broadcast in 
progress -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Reina] ...social sectors. For me it is always 
a pleasure to meet with you to discuss every aspect of the 
nation's problems. From the beginning, I have said this is a 
government that needs to constantly communicate. I do not 
consider this a news conference but, rather, a regular meeting 
with you -- a friendly gathering of reporters -- to review some 
of the issues of interest and to answer the questions you may 
have. I think the Tegucigalpa summit with the U.S. vice 
president was a total success. Its repercussions have been 
great. In the United States, the vice president referred to it 
in very eloquent and praiseworthy terms. In the OAS, he referred 
to Honduras with the highest esteem. 
  Another issue I should mention is the tourism industry -- a 
sector in which we are, to a certain extent, facing an impasse, 
because of a discrepancy with the labor unions. This situation 
is being studied; it is under control; and the manager has been 
dismissed. [sentence as heard] 
  The situation at COHDEFOR [Honduran Corporation for Forest 
Development] is very simple to me. I did not personally 
intervene in COHDEFOR for a simple reason that agrees with our 
moral revolution. If a friend is involved in a particular 
matter, an appropriate and suitable institution should judge 
him. In this case, this institution was the commission that 
oversees COHDEFOR. The manager did not obtain one vote in his 
favor; seven votes were cast against him; and there were two 
abstentions. This was the final verdict, and, in this way, the 
matter was settled. 
  In terms of the Liberal Party deputies' letter, according to 
Santiago David Amador, leader of the wing that drafted the 
letter, there were several versions -- several drafts -- of this 
letter. If a commission reviews one of these drafts and removes 
two or three words -- appropriate words -- I consider the letter 
to be very proper. What is improper in politics is to provide 
tools to combat the government [words indistinct] the same party 
members. A reply will be made on each and every point presented 
by the deputies. In some cases they are right, while others 
must be debated. I will soon meet with all of the deputies, the 
whole cabinet, and all of my advisers -- obviously, this is a 
considerable number of people -- to completely review this 
government's policy. 
  In terms of the supply of cement, if this situation 
continues, we will be forced to take into consideration the 
opening of the borders to stabilize prices. We cannot continue 
to permit the flight of cement overseas, which greatly damages 
the nation's economy. We are going to take this into 
consideration within the appropriate government agencies. 
  The energy crisis is under control. What has occurred is 
that this was a very difficult situation, and we have said this 
from the beginning. A commission has been established to take 
charge of the energy crisis. We have received a letter from 
Jose Pozensa. I am going to ask him to meet with me, because at 
the end of his letter he offers his cooperation with the 
government. He wants this commission to be turned into an 
executive commission. This will have to be discussed in our 
efforts to confront and resolve the crisis. There are several 
ways to resolve this, particularly in cooperation with friendly 
governments, such as the governments of Mexico and China, which 
have offered us all of the support required by these 
circumstances. If this problem is resolved... [pauses] I 
believe that we can adequately resolve this problem -- a problem 
the government has inherited from previous administrations. 
  Another sticky issue is that of the DNI [Department of 
National Investigation]. An impasse of sorts exists in terms of 
what the DNI represented and what the DIC [Department of 
Criminal Investigations] will be. There is a time period 
between June and December in which we will have to make a 
decision. There are two possibilities: The DIC can be placed 
under FUSEP [Public Security Forces], or we will have to find 
another alternative. 
  We must pay compensation to those who have worked in the 
DNI. 
The situation that brought about the appointment of the ad hoc 
commission was a national need, considering the irregularities 
that took place there. Now we are clearing up this situation. 
In general terms, these are the issues that are being widely 
discussed at this point in time. 
  The day before yesterday, I returned from Ceiba where I held 
important meetings. One of them was an open discussion on 
issues such as the aid the central government will give to the 
municipalities. We are very enthusiastic about the support and, 
above all else, about the joyfulness and great hope with which 
the people of Ceiba received this highly ethical government. 
  Another matter I discussed in Ceiba was the announcement 
that 
several departments have been freed from the scourge of the 
parasitic torsalo worm that attacks cattle. This has been a 
serious problem. This positive fact has generally gone by 
unnoticed, much like the positive fact that there is no more 
polio. I believe this fact is good news that should be 
mentioned. It is good to give the people positive news, because 
this helps all Hondurans have a brighter image of the nation. 
  On these and other issues, I am at your disposal for 
discussion. 
  [Moderator] Francisco Jiron, from Voz de Honduras. 
  [Jiron] A number of people are going around carrying heavy 
caliber weapons. Every day, the media report details of 
horrible crimes that take place throughout our territory. Do 
you not believe that, by doing away with the DNI, crime will 
increase, especially considering that there will be a period of 
time in which there are no security corps. While the new corps 
is being trained, this situation will continue. 
  How do you intend to combat this criminal wave sweeping the 
nation, and how are you going to confront the DNI situation, 
even though you have noted that former DNI officials will be 
paid compensation and that they will be integrated to another 
corps. What is going to be done in the meantime? 
  [Reina] Francisco, the crime rate worldwide is dreadful. One 
of the most violent cities in the world is Washington, and all 
of the federal machinery in the United States has not been able 
to control this situation. In San Antonio, Texas, little boys 
go out and test their weapons on people sitting in coffee shops. 
The world is sick with violence. This problem has several 
roots, and one of them is drugs. What must be fought is the use 
of drugs, and this can only be fought by making an about face, 
strengthening families, restoring traditional values, and having 
parents and children engage in dialogue. This sounds like a 
sermon, but, in terms of the drug problem, it is the only 
conclusion that the forum could arrive at. 
  Another problem is the culture of violence. All youngsters 
want to be Rambo. They want to play out violence, and, in turn, 
they copy the worst aspects of other societies. How can we 
fight this? This can be done by taking up these issues as a 
whole. This is what the government is for. This is what the 
institutions are for. 
  We used to criticize the DNI because it practiced torture, 
and we are being critical again because there will no longer be 
a DNI. We must create an adequate corps in the interim. We 
must sit down with all state organizations to finds ways to 
control, prevent, and punish such offenses. I do not think we 
can afford to have no security corps during any given period of 
time. We must find a solution. We must avoid having any period 
in which the absence of authority could cause us further damage. 
There are people who say: Let's return to the time of hoods and 
torture. This is very dangerous. It represents a cry of 
desperation that must be wiped out. 
  The social and ethical progress of a nation is always 
difficult. Why is this? This is because societies get used to 
the vices found in the cultures and counter-cultures they have 
nurtured. If we want to do away with human rights violations 
and with torture, we cannot declare that we have been defeated 
and that we are going to return to the past. What we must do is 
continue progressing. We must learn our lessons from history 
and strike a balance through constructive and sensible dialogue. 
We will not allow this period to pass without adequate security 
forces, because this would be very dangerous. 
  [Unidentified reporter] I want to take this opportunity to 
ask two questions. What really happened at COHDEFOR? The 
former manager claims he made he made a transaction or a legal 
transfer from a state bank to a private bank, earning more 
interest. How much of his dismissal was politically motivated? 
If it was not political, what really happened? In addition, 
what topics did you discuss with former President Rafael 
Callejas, with whom you met last week? 
  [Reina] [Words indistinct] to COHDEFOR's Board of Directors, 
which is the highest authority. I have already said this, and I 
will reiterate it: The case was discussed and analyzed in this 
forum, which is a higher authority than COHDEFOR's general 
manager. There was not one vote in his favor, because he never 
consulted the Board of Directors in implementing those 
transactions, those deposit transfers. I did not want to 
interfere. We are friends, and if I let our friendship 
interfere with the decision made by the relevant organization, I 
would be committing an abuse of power. I left the matter in 
their hands. They made a decision. We already have a new 
COHDEFOR general manager, Sandoval Corea, who is as capable and 
a very prestigious person. 
  Regarding my meeting with former President Callejas, we 
discussed the overall situation in the country and in the 
Central American region. He is a member of the Central American 
Parliament. We discussed all of those topics. I have wanted to 
prove with deeds that I do not see any Honduran as my enemy. 
People do not like sectarianism, but it also appears they 
dislike openness. Now, people are criticizing me for talking 
with Callejas. I believe this criticism is unfair. I believe 
that two men who have had at different times directed the 
country should and must talk. Dr. Suazo Cordova was also 
invited to the dinner held before the meeting, but he was unable 
to attend because of reasons related to his work. I invited the 
former presidents in general, and my meeting with Callejas took 
place within that context. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] the World Bank and the 
Inter-American Development Bank of increasing electricity fees 
by 90 percent. Second, teachers are asking for a salary 
increase estimated at 400 million lempiras. Will the government 
be able to respond to this demand? They are calling for strikes 
within the coming days in public schools. Third, during the 
last meeting you held with members of the Chamber of Commerce 
and Industries in Comayagua, they requested that Palmerola be 
made an international airport. 
  [Reina] Regarding an increase in electricity fees, we are 
amid a crisis that could become very serious for the country. 
It has already caused considerable damage. A special crisis 
commission has been appointed to address the energy issue. If 
this commission decides that the fees must be raised, we must 
accept this, because this would be part of resolving the crisis. 
Otherwise, we would be putting the government between the devil 
and the deep blue sea. 
  [Reporter] You have been charged with failing to solve 
problems and make decisions. When you do make decisions, you 
are accused of making the wrong ones. 
  [Reina] I do not think they are the wrong decisions. If it 
is necessary to make sacrifices, we all have to make them. As 
for the teachers, one bright spot is that the strike scheduled 
for today was temporarily suspended. What does this mean? That 
negotiations are being conducted with willingness to find 
correct, feasible solutions. 
  Where are we going to get the money to increase their 
salaries by 100 percent, as they have demanded? This salary 
hike requires some 800 million lempiras. I have faith that open 
and calm negotiations, without any closed-mindedness, will reach 
a compromise and permit the government to work for the 
teachers's good, which would be the right thing to do. We have 
to revise the salaries of the Honduran people in general. This 
will make it possible to face the crisis in a gradual, sustained 
manner. 
  As for Palmerola, the Comayagua Chamber of Commerce wants an 
international airport located there. The Tegucigalpa Chamber of 
Commerce wants the international airport built in Tegucigalpa. 
It is necessary to study the pros and cons to decide where the 
country's international airport should be located. While we do 
not have a good airport in the capital, we do have five 
international airports. We have to reshuffle all of this. 
  Frankly speaking, the problem has not been one of making 
decisions. Decisions must always be made within the context of 
knowing that someone will disagree. There are no ideal places 
or Utopias. What has been ruled out, however, is that people 
will illicitly profit from these decisions. This is where 
corruption has been at work and has prevented decisions from 
being made. This has been ruled out. We will soon meet with 
the Chambers of Commerce and all of the experts who have worked 
on this in order that the country can make a clear decision. 
There are pros and cons. The goal is to make the best decision 
that will benefit the country most. 
  [Moderator] This is President Reina's answer. Hernan Reyes 
Pineda of the "Opening a Breach" newscast. 
  [Reyes Pineda] I work for the "Opening a Breach" newscast. 
Few people, especially government officials, would admit that 
cement is being smuggled to other Central American countries. 
But you very plainly made this admission this morning. I 
wonder whether or not there will be a way to stop this. I 
understand that the smuggling of cement is controlled by the 
Armed Forces through the IPM [Military Social Security 
Institute]. Moreover, are you planning to open the border for 
the buying and selling of cement? What effect would such an 
opening have on the price of cement? 
  [Reina] You are correct in your question. Cement is being 
illegally sold to other countries, and our construction industry 
is grinding to a halt because of the cement shortage. We cannot 
go on like this. Whoever is doing this is doing great harm to 
the country. 
  There is a good chance that the border will be opened. If 
there is no other way to control such smuggling operations, we 
will have to do this. We can buy cement at lower prices outside 
the country. Nevertheless, such a dramatic measure would require 
the people's complete support. 
  [Moderator] What else would you like to ask? 
  [Reyes Pineda] I referred to the possibility of stopping 
this 
smuggling. I understand that the sale of cement is mostly 
controlled by the Armed Forces. 
  [Reina] We must find the source. If it is not stopped, we 
will open the border to lower the price of cement. 
  [Moderator] President Reina has just discussed the shortage 
of cement in the country and the possible solutions. 
  [Reporter] Do you think that, as the result of the moral 
revolution, the attorney general will have to determine in his 
investigation whether or not ministers, directors of autonomous 
institutions, and other officials in your government have filed 
their personal property and administrative integrity statements? 
It has been said that an investigation will be conducted, but 
only on former governments, not this one. 
  Also, I would like to hear your views on one other issue. A 
few days ago, a group of high-ranking Armed Forces officers said 
events of an unpredictable nature are about to happen in the 
country. Finally, public employee union leaders told the media 
today that they have tried to talk with you in an effort to 
reach an understanding between the executive and state workers, 
but they said they have encountered a series of obstacles. What 
can you say about this? 
  [Reina] I think our demands for administrative honesty must 
cover everyone. There cannot be justice for one group only, or 
persecution through the state institutions. The administrative 
honesty principle must apply to previous governments, and it 
applies to this one as well. 
  As for the statements by a member of the Armed Forces, I 
think he should not have made them because such things are the 
cause of great anxiety. A bunch of nervous people could sink 
the entire country. I think this does not do the institution any 
good and it does not reflect the true situation. The current 
government is legitimate and enjoys great international 
prestige. In addition, the government is open to dialogue, 
seeks unity, and is handling everything honestly. 
  As for the state workers unions, I have not heard union 
members complain. The doors are open to resuming the dialogue. 
Sometimes it is impossible to please everyone, however. 
  The U.S. vice president's visit to Honduras was almost 
prevented because relatives of the Pronor [expansion unknown] 
owners began to leave the country as if a disaster was about to 
occur, and simply because of a conversation that would take 
place among a few people. In the name of the office I have 
assumed for the people, I have asked people not to exaggerate 
situations, because this could do great harm to the nation. 
[passage omitted including indistinct portions] 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] the institution is bankrupt. 
Will it get the 3 million lempiras it has requested? In 
addition, I understand you will fly to El Salvador tomorrow to 
attend the new president's installation. Are any bilateral 
meetings planned? 
  [Reina] [passage omitted] The previous government's 
employees 
in the National Social Welfare Board should not be removed, but 
you are right: There is not much money. Nevertheless, we have 
given instructions for sufficient funds to be transferred to 
this institution. I think this operation is already under way 
in an effort to avoid shutting down the institution, which has a 
proud background of working for the Honduran children and the 
Honduran people in general. 
  I will attend the transfer of government from President 
Cristiani to President Calderon Sol. Central American 
presidents always take advantage of such opportunities to talk. 
I think I will meet with UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali, whom I met in Paris a number of years ago. He was 
my professor at the Sorbonne. This puts me close to this great 
jurist, who also wants to talk about the upcoming regional 
American summits, which are very important. An Ibero-American 
summit is to be held in Colombia this month. Then there will be 
a meeting in Nicaragua, and another in Tegucigalpa in October. 
The year concludes with the Miami summit, where we will 
establish an agenda that will put us in harmony with the current 
situation. In that agenda, and you are familiar with its 
topics, we have to fight drug trafficking, defend human rights 
and the environment, create sustainable development, put a human 
face on measures taken, and make the moral revolution -- 
something they call the good government [preceding two words in 
English] over there. Languages are odd that way. That is the 
way they refer to something we call the moral revolution here.

    [Editorial Report] Managua Radio Nicaragua Network in 
Spanish at 2113 GMT on 29 May broadcasts a live relay of a 
36-minute news conference by President Violeta Barrios de 
Chamorro and Costa Rican President Jose Figueres Olsen with 
unidentified reporters following a working meeting at San Juan 
del Sur, Nicaragua. 
  In her opening statement, President Chamorro discusses the 
topics they addressed at the meeting: "We have spoken about many 
things. Great concern was expressed over preventive health 
measures. We are going to work jointly on this. We are also 
going to work jointly to prevent drug trafficking and money 
laundering. We are also going to take steps to prevent problems 
on our oceans and lakes. Fishing boats will be identified to 
avoid problems in an attempt to prevent it from ever being said 
again that Nicaragua seized a small boat or that Costa Rica 
seized another. We do not want these problems." She adds: 
"There is no protocol here, because I do not think Nicaragua and 
Costa Rica need a protocol. What we want is brotherhood." 
  In his opening statement, President Figueres thanks 
President 
Chamorro for the invitation and notes the excellent relations 
between their two countries, adding: "We hope to continue to 
strengthen these relations, and, as a result of these meetings, 
very specific solutions will be found to eliminate within the 
next months and years those very small pebbles in our shoes -- 
small problems we sometimes have had in our bilateral relations." 
  Explaining the issues they discussed, Figueres indicates 
that 
they dealt with social, economic, and political matters. He 
notes that they discussed programs against dengue fever and the 
need to strengthen housing and sports programs. In terms of 
economics, he reports they discussed bilateral trade: "I would 
like to mention the challenges we are facing in bilateral 
relations. Of course, we talked at length about trade. The 
economy and agricultural ministers have been working in order 
that, within 45 days, we will have clear and definite mechanisms 
to remove the obstacles that have existed in our bilateral trade 
and so that we can have a more productive and simpler trade 
process." 
  Figueres states that he and Chamorro reviewed the problem of 
cross-border smuggling, especially the problem of cattle 
rustling, which has increased in recent years. He goes on to 
state they also discussed fishing and tourism problems, adding: 
"We want our ministries to find a mechanism to warn the boats of 
one country that they are sailing in territorial waters of the 
other country. The truth is that the boats are not acting with 
ill-intent. They are not crossing the border on purpose. We 
want to establish a means by which they know when they are 
nearing the limits of their territorial waters, and, in turn, we 
will no longer have the problems we are experiencing today." 
  In outlining the political issues they discussed, Figueres 
says: "We talked about border issues and the opportunities our 
common border provides in strengthening the ties between our 
countries. We discussed the operating hours of border 
checkpoints and decided to extend them, improving the border 
crossing process for Nicaraguans, Costa Ricans, and foreign 
tourists." 
  During the question and answer segment of the news 
conference, President Chamorro replies to a reporter's question 
on whether or not Nicaragua will accept the entry of Haitian 
refugees as the U.S. Government has requested: "As far as 
Nicaragua is concerned, as well as all Central Americans are 
concerned, we have been presented with a minor suggestion from 
Vice President Gore. We will decide on this. We are reviewing 
it in advance of our next meeting in December, and, at that 
time, we will announce the results of our review." 
  In answering the same question, President Figueres states: 
"In Costa Rica's case, it is a situation we still have to review 
with Presidency Minister Elias Soley and Foreign Minister 
Fernando Naranjo. I believe that Costa Rica, as a country that 
is always respectful of human rights, must study this carefully, 
and that the appropriate forum to discuss this topic is one in 
which all of the countries of the continent are present."

  [Text] Army Commander General Reynaldo Caceres said 
yesterday that the military units deployed in the Chapare region 
are only carrying out their constitutional mission of watching 
over the country's internal security. He made clear that he did 
not authorize any large deployment, as had been reported by some 
peasant leaders over the last few days. 
  He said that the social situation in that conflictive coca 
growing region requires that the institutions in charge of 
guaranteeing public security take the necessary measures to 
fulfill their objective. 
  Gen. Caceres told PRESENCIA: "I don't know why they are 
making a fuss out of some military movements there. I am the 
one who gives the orders for the Army to move, and I have not 
given any orders in that sense. There are some things, however, 
that should be investigated, but this is a military matter." 
  He said that military deployment anywhere in the country is 
fully supported by the Constitution, and that such action seeks 
only to preserve the constitutional guarantees of the Bolivian 
people. 
  Asked about the official who ordered the military deployment 
in the tropical region of Cochabamba, Gen. Caceres said: "We 
don't need to ask permission of anyone, because to fulfill our 
mission effectively we need to move throughout the entire 
national territory. We do that constantly and routinely, and 
there is no reason why the public should be alarmed. Our 
presence anywhere should not be reason for alarm." 
  He noted: "The Constitution clearly determines the mission 
of the Armed Forces, and we only fulfill that mission." 
  Armed Forces Commander General Fernando Sanjines 
corroborated 
the comments made by Gen. Caceres, saying: "Of course the Armed 
Forces can be in any place at any time, like all the people, but 
basically there is no military deployment, and no order was 
given in that regard." 
  On 19 May Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz said that the 
intelligence services of the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) 
found indications of the presence in the Chapare region of 
people linked to international drug trafficking, and that they 
are reportedly encouraging the formation of armed irregular 
groups in their service. 
  In this regard the Army commander said this possibility 
should not be dismissed, and admitted that the Army intelligence 
services are evaluating the preliminary intelligence reports. 
  Gen. Caceres said: "Nothing should be dismissed, as such 
indications do exist, which is why we should evaluate and 
investigate the reports. We cannot dismiss anything."

  [Text] Deputies and senators have failed to report to 
Congress to extend the period of work on the reform of the 
Constitution. Only six amendments were approved in seven months 
of work. 
  The constitutional reform work ended today. The reform 
period was not extended, and no decision was made to start a new 
constitutional reform next year. 
  Throughout the day today, party leaders negotiated the 
approval of an amendment proposed by rapporteur Nelson Jobim for 
the creation of a mechanism to make regular constitutional 
amendments every 10 years. The leaders reached an agreement on 
the proposal, but deputies and senators did not respond to their 
leaders' call, and there was no quorum for approving the 
amendment. 
  Consequently, the two sessions on the last day of work of 
the 
Constituent Congress were used to make speeches lamenting its 
failure. 
  Former PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] leader Jose 
Serra blamed the lawmakers who abstained from participating in 
the debate because they did not want to commit themselves and 
lose votes in an electoral year. 
  PFL [Liberal Front Party] leader Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes said 
that the country is lagging behind history, and that it will 
have fewer jobs, fewer investment, and less competitiveness. 
  PSDB presidential candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who 
attended the last session, said he will strive for a new reform 
next year. 
  Since it was installed in October 1993, the Constituent 
Congress managed to approve only six amendments, which will be 
promulgated within the next few days.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Pinochet Stayed in Amstel Hotel </F>
Under Pseudonym"] 
  [Text] Former Chilean President Pinochet stayed in the 
Amstel hotel in Amsterdam in the night of Thursday to Friday, 
where he had signed up under a false name. On Friday morning 
staff members recognized him. 
  The hotel management went to talk to Pinochet and his party, 
says director F. van der Post. "We told him that we could not 
guarantee his safety or the safety of the others in the hotel. 
His security people then decided to leave." Pinochet and his 
party left the hotel on Friday night, according to Post. 
  The former dictator is on a tour of Europe this week. He is 
leading a trade delegation from the Army's procurement 
department. Today [30 May] he is expected in the Czech capital 
Prague. 
  Czech President Havel and Prime Minister Klaus openly 
dissociated themselves from the visit. "I am not thrilled about 
the fact that the first important Chilean trade mission to the 
Czech Republic is led by General Pinochet," Havel declared. 
"But I consider this notification." 
  According to the president, Pinochet has not been invited by 
any official department and will not meet with government 
representatives. Pinochet was invited by the semi state company 
Omnipol, which is responsible for the sale of Czech arms.

  [Text] Once again, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy has 
committed a journalistic "blunder." This time he said he would 
make every effort not to dissolve Congress, which caused 
commotion in congressional circles. As a way of showing how 
"sorry" he was, Wasmosy sent two notes to Congress explaining 
his remarks and "renewing" his confidence in Congress. He 
expressed profound indignation and vexation over what had been 
published in the morning newspapers. His "justification," 
however, has not prevented harsh criticism from both opposition 
and official blocs, which termed his attitude as "dangerous" for 
democracy. 
  The president's remark that he would do everything possible 
to not dissolve Congress provoked a shower of criticism from 
legislators of several blocs. This compelled the chief of state 
to clarify his remarks. He sent a note in which he renews his 
"confidence" in Congress. 
  The president's new and controversial remarks were published 
by the Argentine newspaper AMBITO FINANCIERO. Despite an 
attempt to "apologize" to Congress, he was unable to prevent an 
overall rebuke from opposition and official blocs for his 
remarks, which were termed as an attack on democracy. 
  Wasmosy's "justification" note arrived at Congress at noon. 
He expresses his vexation over the Argentine newspaper report 
that he would do everything possible to avoid dissolving 
Congress. 
  Hugo Saguier Caballero, secretary general of the Presidency, 
handed the official note to Senate President Evelio Fernandez 
Arevalos and Chamber of Deputies President Francisco Jose de 
Vargas. Wasmosy's note states: "I am extremely vexed over the 
information that appeared in the newspapers today which 
indicates that I will do everything to avoid dissolving 
Congress." 
  The note adds: "Unfortunately, the article does not honestly 
convey my thoughts. No one can presuppose that I intend 
violating express constitutional clauses." Wasmosy emphasizes: 
"I deem it necessary to emphasis my decision to use all my 
efforts to prevent situations that could harbor the idea of 
violating the Constitution." 
  The note concludes: "I believe it is neccessary for me to 
address these lines to you with the sole intention of renewing 
my confidence and my hope of good governing through the 
rectitude and honor of the members of Congress."

  [Text] The Shining Path (SL) terrorist group -- once 
described as the most lethal and bloody terrorist group in the 
world -- is in the final throws of its alliance with drug 
traffickers. The harsh and devastating blows it has received at 
the hands of the forces of order over the last couple of months 
have considerably undermined its criminal activities in the 
Peruvian jungle. 
  In the Huallaga Front, where most clashes take place, the 
Armed Forces and the Peruvian National Police [PNP] have 
separated terrorism from narcotrafficking by attacking it to 
such an extent that any possibility of a future alliance is 
almost nonexistent. The Aries offensive is no coincidence. The 
military command has information on subversive movements in the 
Cuchara region. 
  This military offensive compelled the SL people's guerrilla 
army -- the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Army] is almost 
totally annihilated -- to desperately take refuge south of the 
Upper Huallaga region while drug traffickers headed north of 
Ayacucho and more recently to Madre de Dios where the Army and 
the PNP are dealing with them harshly. 
  In the Cuchara and Primavera regions -- where the Aries 
operation is being conducted -- SL commanders are being severely 
questioned by their subordinates who, in view of the 
intensification of military actions, are taking advantage of the 
Repentance Law. 
  These desertions are prompting SL commanders to 
indiscriminately kill any SL member who disobeys orders. 
  Carlos, a 13-year-old boy who escaped with his father from 
the theater of opeations, said: "SL members are killing each 
other because they no longer know what to do in the jungle." 
  This can only be interpreted as a desperate move by the SL 
commanders, who interpret these "rebellions" as the end of their 
Maoist ideology. The Ashasninkas indigenous group are taking 
advantage of this situation and escaping the long and ruthless 
captivity they have endured at the hands of SL. 
  Eight SL terrorists, among them little Carlos, who endured 
the most deplorable living conditions imposed by the SL 
commanders, surrendered five weeks ago at the Quiteni 
antisubversive base in Satipo, in the Frente Mantaro 
jurisdiction. The living conditions in the Army bases in the 
jungle are very different. 
  The Army has installed 15 countersubversive bases with 
military personnel to welcome repentant SL members and to offer 
them the best conditions and treatment. 
  A Tingo Maria military officer says: "We are not saying 
this. 
This is being said by the SL members who surrendered at our 
bases. They do not want to leave. In our installations they 
find food and work and they receive the best treatment."

  [Excerpts] Montevideo, 27 May (EFE) -- According to the 
latest polls, former President Julio Maria Sanguinetti's 
Colorado Party has increased its lead to 11 points for the 
elections scheduled for 29 November in Uruguay. 
  The significant preference for the Colorado Party increased 
after Sanguinetti achieved an electoral agreement with Senator 
Hugo Batalla, the leader of the social democratic Party for 
Government by the People, who will be the vice presidential 
candidate. 
  According to the results of a nationwide poll by the 
Consultants Team Company, the Colorado Party has 33 percent of 
the preferences while 21 percent of the voters remain undecided. 
  After the establishment of most of the presidential 
candidates, the Colorado Party has received the largest 
percentage of preferences in the polls since February 1993. 
  The Colorado Party has maintained an upward trend after it 
reached its lowest point--26 percent--in July 1991, one year 
after the National Party (Blanco) administration of President 
Luis Alberto Lacalle was installed. 
  The Blanco Party, which is in the government for the third 
time this century, has received the lowest preference rates of 
its history, with 13 percent in December 1992 and 17 percent a 
year later. [passage omitted] 
  The leftist coalition Broad Front comes second, but its 
popularity has dropped from 25 to 22 percent between April and 
May. 
  The coalition, established in March 1971, has been losing 
votes in Montevideo, its traditional electoral stronghold, 
during the past few months. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Julio Reyes] </F>
  [Excerpts] President Rafael Caldera has outlined his 
government's decision to face difficulties with courage during a 
speech at a ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the 
Chamber of Commerce of Maracaibo. 
  In his second visit to the region after becoming president 
for the second time, Caldera expressed his faith and optimism 
that the country will overcome the serious difficulties it is 
facing. 
  He said our problems are not the result of nature or 
Providence but, rather, of errors made in setting national 
policy. [passage omitted] 
  The president delivered a speech at the closing of the 
commemoration ceremony. He affirmed that there are large 
differences between the Venezuela that never knew what oil was 
and the Venezuela that experienced the oil boom, but, more 
important, he said was the fundamental fact that there now 
exists a "willingness to promote and open new possibilities and 
horizons." 
  He added: "Maracaibo is being increasingly incorporated into 
the nation's development each and every day, and it is 
constantly showing its ability to compete for the best position 
in the task of making Venezuela a prosperous country. 
  "We are, without a doubt, confronting a difficult situation 
that has not been prompted by natural causes, nor by the 
cyclical development of national life, but by the serious 
mistakes and errors in forming national policy. 
  "Within this difficult situation, however, there is 
undoubtedly a common objective, as has been outlined in the 
speech by Chamber of Commerce President Jorge Porras: `It is the 
responsibility of all Venezuelans to overcome the obstacles 
posed by the current situation.'" [passage omitted] 
  The president also said: "We are convinced that our efforts 
to reactivate the economy will not be enough if we fail to 
understand that the fundamental objective is not wealth in and 
of itself, but wealth in favor of human needs to improve the 
standards of living of all human beings." 
  The president said the country is experiencing a yearning 
for 
victory, a feeling of hope, and a favorable outlook, adding that 
it has the deep feeling that there exists a healthy, firm, and 
decisive resolve to guide the nation toward meeting established 
objectives." [no opening quotation marks as published] 
  "At this moment, we feel there exists, both within and 
outside of Venezuela, a favorable trend to invest in various 
economic activities, because it is perceived that we live in a 
country blessed by nature and protected by Providence and that 
all well-intended initiatives will be successful." 
  He added that on this 100th anniversary of Maracaibo's 
Chamber of Commerce he sees signs of hope and encouragement for 
all Venezuelans. 
  Caldera remarked: "This 100th anniversary represents for all 
a great inspiration and the reaffirmation of self-esteem, which 
has been crippled in recent years." 
  Meanwhile, the president explained there are people who, in 
recent years, have experienced the diabolical pleasure of 
harming, destroying, and sowing doubts in our own country and 
ourselves. 
  Caldera concluded: "I feel that at this time it is our duty 
to fight to make the Venezuelan people take pride in our 
traditions. This is a time for action, faith, and unyielding 
resolve to get Venezuela back on its feet. We must recognize the 
difficult situation the country has been in, but we must also 
understand that there exists a vitality that will enable us to 
overcome these difficulties. There is a powerful national and 
regional vitality that lets us see that we will enter the 21st 
century with the distinct opportunity to progress and achieve 
reaffirmation and stability. 
  "I congratulate the people of Zulia at this commemoration. 
Here is a confirmation of endurance and a contribution in favor 
of the greater needs of the region and country."

  [Text] Montevideo, 31 May (EFE) -- Uruguay will challenge 
Chile's partial entry into the Common Market of the South 
(Mercosur) or access through a free trade zone, and will only 
accept it as a full-fledged member, diplomatic sources linked to 
the negotiations stressed in Montevideo today. Chile is the 
only South American country that has its way paved toward 
joining Mercosur, as it is not a member of any other system. 
  An exception clause for Chile's future entry into the common 
market formed by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay was 
specifically included in the Asuncion Treaty of 26 March 1991. 
  Other countries do not have this possibility as the Asuncion 
Treaty bans the entry of those countries that have joined other 
agreements such as the Andean Pact, of which Chile is not a 
member. So far, this clause has prevented the entry of Bolivia, 
the first country to be interested in joining the Southern 
Cone's economic system. 
  Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa announced that in 
June, his country would formalize a proposal to join Mercosur by 
establishing a free trade zone. 
  The Uruguayan negotiators' reaction did not take long, and 
they expressed that any country that wants to join Mercosur 
would have to meet all requirements, including the 
implementation of a common external tariff. 
  The Uruguayan stance seems to challenge the interests of 
Argentina and Brazil, Mercosur's main partners. Following the 
interest expressed by President Frei's new administration, 
Argentina and Brazil are promoting a partial association with 
Chile. 
  The Uruguayan officials admitted that the Mercosur partners 
have not yet discussed the Chilean proposal. The Uruguayan 
Government has therefore not yet had an opportunity to express 
its official opinion. 
  Experts, however, have noted: "A country that does not pay 
the cost of a common external tariff cannot enjoy the same 
benefits in exporting to markets in Brazil and Argentina." 
  In a commentary for a newspaper that specializes in economic 
issues, another Uruguayan official said: "We Uruguayans do not 
want to lock ourselves into a stubborn stance, nor replace 
imports with local products, but if we do not respect legal 
frameworks we would be drawing up agreements like custom-made 
clothes." 
  According to the newspaper EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO, for 
Uruguay, "any integration must take place within the legal 
framework that we are handling. In this regard, the Asuncion 
Treaty applies. Any country that wants to join in will have to 
abide by the entire treaty and not by part of it alone."

<F P=106> ["jtr"-signed report: "Striving for Latin American </F>
Integration"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 30 May -- Bolivia's government wants to work 
toward making Latin America one, single, free trade zone in the 
medium-term. This association should then be integrated into 
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Bolivia's Trade 
and Industry Minister Carlos Morales said in Bonn. 
  "We want to make use of our Andes Group presidency this year 
to get on with Latin American economic integration," Morales 
said. That is why at the next Andes Group summit (including 
Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela) in September, the 
presidents of the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] 
countries, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay will also be 
invited. 
  The heads of state are planning a joint preparation of the 
all-American conference in Miami in December, which will be 
attended by government representatives from Canada, the United 
States, and Central and South America. Political and economic 
cooperation as well as the fight against drug dealing will be on 
the agenda. 
  Prior to that, on the occasion of the soccer World Cup 
opening match between Germany and Bolivia in Chicago, Bolivian 
President Sanchez de Lozada wants to discuss Latin America's 
future relations with the United States and the European Union 
[EU] with Chancellor Kohl and President Clinton. 
  For Morales, Latin America's integration within NAFTA is a 
long-term objective; "before that, we Latin Americans will have 
to do our homework." This means that each country has to 
stabilize and open up its economy. Therefore, since 1986, his 
country has gradually lowered its customs duties to 5 percent 
for capital goods and 10 percent for consumer goods. It is also 
important that the Mercosur countries quickly agree on common 
external duties. The line of conflict runs between Argentina 
and Brazil advocating comparatively high import duties on the 
one hand, and Paraguay, calling for a much lower import duty on 
the other. 
  Once Mercosur and the Andes Pact have stabilized, they are 
to 
be merged step by step, Morales said. "The Latin American free 
trade zone has to come into existence within the next 10 years, 
otherwise we will be helplessly facing a world of integrated 
blocs." The minister is convinced that the U.S. Administration 
prefers talking to a unified region to talking to individual 
countries. An exception to that is economically successful 
Chile, the next candidate to be accepted into NAFTA, Morales 
said.

<F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina told the 
ministerial conference of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] that the 
movement's number one priority is the promotion of the Third 
World countries' economic and social development. 
  During the opening of the conference, which is taking place 
in Cairo, Egypt, Robaina said that for Cuba, the best guarantee 
for a firm and lasting peace is the absence of hunger. Robaina 
said this is how the human rights of all the inhabitants of the 
earth will be respected. The Cuban foreign minister said the 
world's current situation can best be summarized by an affluent 
North and an impoverished South, and if the nonaligned countries 
crossed their arms, one third of humanity would disappear. 
  In addition to his participation at the nonaligned 
conference, the Cuban foreign minister met with representatives 
of Libya, the PRC, Cyprus, Panama, Colombia, Italy, and Ecuador, 
with whom he reviewed the need to find a common language to 
achieve specific results.

  [Text] On 1 June in Mexico, Cuban Foreign Investment 
Minister Ernesto Melendez stressed the need to revalue the Latin 
America Economic System [SELA] and adapt it to the new 
international situation. Melendez heads the Cuban delegation to 
the 20th SELA Ministerial Council. 
  The three-day meeting will focus on regional integration and 
SELA's role in the 21st century. SELA will also discuss the 
negative effect for Latin American economies of the increase of 
bank interest rates implemented by Washington. Each added 
interest point immediately results in a significant increase in 
the already bulky foreign debt of South American countries.

<F P=106> [Article by Homero Campa] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Mexican Swaps 
  The plan for paying off the Cuban debt through investments 
began with the Tuxpan Hotel in Varadero. This four-star hotel, 
operated by the German firm LTI, is a highly successful venture. 
Its average occupancy is 92.2 percent during peak season. It has 
233 rooms with ocean views right on the beach. It also has 
atmosphere: Tourists are greeted by a stone Aztec calendar as 
they walk into the lobby, which is decorated with borders and 
figurines made out of precious woods, reproductions of 
archeological pieces. Its discotheque, "La Bamba," is famous 
because, in the interest of "providing atmosphere," it does not 
prevent local Cubans from gaining admittance. 
  Bufete Industrial designed this hotel in the Mexican style 
of 
architecture, but all of the construction was done by Cubans. As 
with other hotels, the government offered 50 percent of the 
shares for sale. In May 1992, the DSC group of Guadalajara, led 
at that time by Jose Giral (former director of the Xabre group), 
bought the stock. Indecision about how the purchase would be 
carried out resulted in delays, however. In 1993, it was agreed 
that it would be done by means of swaps. The amount of the 
investment was $15 million. 
  The second project was the El Mariel cement plant, located 
in 
the port of the same name, 20 kilometers from Havana. It is the 
largest of the six cement factories on the island. After the 
demise of the Soviet Union and the European Socialist bloc, they 
were left without raw materials, and no one had the money to buy 
them. According to a study by Donna Rich and Michel Kaplowitz of 
Johns Hopkins University, these plants have the potential to 
produce 5,500 tons of cement a year. 
  Lorenzo Zambrano, the majority shareholder in Cemex, came to 
the rescue. He formed a joint venture with the Cuban Cement 
Union for a total investment of $80 million. Cuba provided half 
of that amount in the form of the facilities; $20 million took 
the form of swaps, and $20 million was in fresh money from the 
Mexican Foreign Trade Bank. Cemex is marketing the cement on the 
international market. 
  The third project, in the petroleum sector, was announced by 
Mexico's ambassador to Cuba, Carlos Tello Macias, in a sidewalk 
interview at the end of a ceremony in Cuba commemorating the 
birthday of Benito Juarez last 21 March. 
  "I do not know the technical details," said the ambassador, 
"but I understand that Mexpetrol and a Cuban company will work 
together to rehabilitate and expand the refinery in Cienfuegos. 
They will process Mexican crude oil and other products there." 
  The Cienfuegos refinery, located in the southern part of the 
island, has the capacity to process 3 million tons of crude a 
year, according to data supplied by the Cupet company of Cuba. 
At present it is partially shut down because Cuba does not have 
any petroleum or any money to buy it. Moreover, the plant was 
built with Soviet technology and needs renovation. 
  According to sources close to the negotiations, Mexpetrol 
(of 
which Pemex is the majority shareholder) and Cupet of Cuba 
signed a "letter of intent" and will sign the agreement in two 
months. The investment amounts to $200 million, $100 million 
from Cupec in the form of the facilities, and $100 million from 
the Mexican side, as follows: $50 million in swaps, with stock 
in the refinery itself, and $50 million in fresh money. 
  Although Mexpetrol is heading up the negotiations for the 
Mexican side, the Mexican Petroleum Institute (which will 
provide the scientific studies) and the private construction 
firms ICA and Protexa are also involved. Bancomext will provide 
the credit. 
  This new Cuban-Mexican firm will pay for the credit in cash, 
but there is also the possibility that it may make some payments 
in refined Mexican crude. 
  Cienfuegos has one advantage in refining petrochemicals and 
by-products: It is directly connected to a supertanker base in 
the port of Matanzas, in the western part of the island, by a 
187-kilometer pipeline. 
<H5>  IUSA vs. Telmex </H5>
  These three investments mark the beginning of Mexico's swaps 
in Cuba. Other Mexicans are apparently looking for similar 
opportunities. 
  In the case of IUSA, owned by Alejo Peralta, his son Carlos 
Peralta offered the Cuban Government an investment project to 
modernize the island's telephone system. The current system is 
in a state of deterioration, and has 1950's-era technology. His 
idea was to bring in satellite communication systems for 
international and local calling. 
  As a prelude, he donated to Castro's government two rural 
phone systems valued at $300,000 each. They are now in use in 
the Provinces of Pinar del Rio and Havana to link up various 
agricultural camps. 
  The younger Peralta's representative in Cuba was Manuel 
Cerrillo, who negotiated an investment project amounting to more 
than $1 billion, 25 percent in swaps. The deal involved paying 
approximately $200 million, equivalent to two-thirds of Cuba's 
current debt to Mexico. Thus, it was the biggest investment 
project between the two countries. A "protocol agreement" was 
even signed. 
  Suddenly, to the Cubans' surprise, Carlos Peralta said 
nevermind. He argued that his envoy, Cerrillo, had gone beyond 
the authorized limitations in the negotiations and had signed on 
to terms that Peralta had not agreed to. Havana officials were 
surprised and irritated. It was revealed, however, that the 
investment is not a lost cause, and there is hope that an 
agreement can be reached. 
  In response, Carlos Slim, majority shareholder in Telmex, 
stepped into the fray. He also submitted a proposal to modernize 
the Cuban telephone system, and during the first week in March 
he came to Havana to negotiate a deal. 
  Slim and Peralta are not the only ones vying to win this 
contract from the Cuban Government. Several Spanish and English 
firms and a Canadian one are also hoping for a nod from Castro's 
government. Castro has formed a special group to study the 
proposals. 
  For the time being, only two other Mexican businessmen have 
made direct investments on the island: Luis Nino de Rivera, in a 
cellular telephone system that he has operated in Havana and 
Varadero for two years; and Monterrey businessmen Mauricio 
Fernandez and Danny Tafich, who made a joint investment with the 
Castro regime to breathe life into 15 Cuban textile plants that 
had been practically idled for lack of capital and inputs. 
  Other companies have announced investment projects, but 
nothing has come to pass yet. One example is Infra, which 
belongs to Vicente Gutierrez Camposeco, former president of the 
National Association of Manufacturers (Canacintra), and which 
tried to set up a plant to produce solder. Another is Bancomer, 
which talked about introducing credit cards to Cuba and offering 
other banking services. Other examples are the Vitro group, 
which tried to build a plant to produce glass and plastic 
containers; and Bufete Industrial, which intended to participate 
in the construction of the Villa Cuba Hotel in Varadero. 
<H5>  Mexico: Most Favored Nation </H5>
  "Mexico is the most favored nation," stated Ernesto 
Melendez, 
president of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation 
(CECE), last year during a meeting with businessmen in London. 
"But," he added, "the investment is still at a low level, 
considering the two countries' potential." 
  So far, most Mexican businessmen have confined themselves to 
the commerce sector. Some 200 companies of various sizes and 
product lines are exporting everything from canned food to 
intermediate manufactured goods to Cuba. The volume is small, 
however. They do not account for as much as 5 percent of Cuba's 
imports. Trade between the two countries reached $125 million in 
1992. This is such a tiny proportion of Mexico's exports that 
Cuba does not appear in its annual statistical reports on 
foreign trade. 
  "We must be more aggressive about participating in trade 
(with Cuba) so as not to be edged out by other countries," 
asserted Gutierrez Camposeco in October, when he was still 
president of Canacintra, in a lengthy interview with the Mexican 
business magazine EXPANSION. 
  But Mexican businessmen appear timid and slow to act. "Many 
national goods that are sold on the Cuban market are not brought 
in by Mexican firms, but by Spanish ones. In other words, the 
Spaniards are eating our lunch in Cuba, and with our own 
products," said Carlos Sanchez Lara, then Mexico's commercial 
attache in Cuba, in June of last year to a delegation of 15 
businessmen who had come to the island to look into the 
possibilities for joint ventures. 
  "We cannot allow that to continue," he declared 
emphatically. 
  Furthermore, "Mexico is squandering investment and trade 
opportunities in Cuba because it is not up to date on that 
market, and it has failed to take into account the very 
favorable objective conditions: geographic proximity, stable 
economic and political ties, common cultures, favorable 
market...." 
  In the Cuban business world, Mexicans have gained a 
reputation for "always saying yes, but not saying when." 
  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina acknowledged in February 
that commercial relations with Mexico "are not as intensive as 
we would like. Mexico knows this," he stated, "and we regret 
it." He admitted that the economic ties are not commensurate 
with the political relations the two countries have maintained, 
and he expressed the hope that the situation would change as the 
Cuban economy opens up more and more to foreign capital. 
  On 21 March of this year, Ambassador Carlos Tello stated 
that 
commercial ties between the two countries "are growing, and I 
have been instructed to maintain them, strengthen them, and 
expand them." 
  As if to dispel any doubts, he added: "There will be fresh 
money, financing, and investment."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Luis Baez Delgado] </F>
  [Text] No matter how hard they try, the computers of the 
CIA and the Pentagon cannot decipher the code that has prevented 
the Cuban Army from losing its combat readiness and succumbing 
to instability and even disintegration (as has happened in other 
parts of the world), despite the devastating blow it has 
suffered as its state funding has been slashed to unprecedented 
levels, for reasons known to all. 
  The imperialists know that without an army, there is no 
country, and they daydream of the fabulous possibilities. What 
they do not know is that long before the Special Period, the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR) began working, step by step, on 
a savings program. They began looking for alternative sources of 
energy, ways to make more rational and efficient use of 
resources, and other options for supplying the troops and 
feeding the population. 
  When other state institutions made plans to operate with 75 
percent of their fuel allotments, the FAR planned on 50 percent. 
When the other institutions went to 50 percent, the FAR began 
preparing to maintain and even expand their operations at only 
25 percent. 
  When there was talk of a possible zero option, the Army that 
inherited the legacy of heroism from our mambises 
[Cuban rebels during Spanish domination] and the combatants of 
the Rebel Army and the underground period did not cringe or 
panic. It had been preparing for this eventuality for years. 
  Today the results can be seen in Military Unit 1640 of the 
Eastern Army. Nothing has been left to chance; no one has rested 
on his laurels. 
  This is the only explanation for the fact that this military 
unit has continued to fulfill -- even to exceed, in some aspects 
-- its assigned tasks with just 19 percent of the fuel and 40 
percent of the electricity it received in 1989. Reducing the two 
to their common denominator, this means it has saved 70 percent 
on energy. And these are not inflated figures; we went to the 
field and saw it with our own eyes. 
  The innovations include the use of solar heaters, 
translucent 
roof tiles, animals for hauling, and biogas; sugarcane husks and 
residue as sources of energy; emulsion and magnetism in training 
units and rear-guard services; bicycles in various activities; 
and wind energy and compressed air technology. 
  All of this has made it possible to maintain a high training 
capacity and combat readiness with the absolute minimum amount 
of fuel. This fact merits special mention because of what it 
means for the country's defense. 
  One of the many examples that back up this assertion can be 
found in what has come to be known as "Red Bat," a kind of radar 
adapted to the warlike conditions that the entire nation faces. 
It used to require 10 trucks and more than eight hours for 
deployment. Now, after having been remodeled, it requires only 
three trucks for transportation and it can be set up in just 30 
minutes. Moreover, it is even more effective. 
  In addition, when a young sharpshooter demonstrated his 
excellent skills and was asked about the accessories he used, he 
explained that they are exclusively designed and manufactured in 
Cuba. 
  If the imperialists managed to capture those images with 
their satellites -- and surely they must have because they spend 
every minute spying on us -- they would be doing those in Miami 
who still clamor for an armed confrontation with the revolution 
a great favor by showing them those images. 
  The imperialists also do not know, and are incapable of 
imagining, how these Military Councils of the Revolutionary 
Armed Forces take place. 
  Suffice it to say that the nature of these councils was made 
clear when, at the end of the presentation by the unit 
commander, the first words of the minister of the FAR were: 
"Come on and ask some questions. The purpose of the councils is 
to spark debate." 
  The way the exchange took place and the topics that were 
discussed also revealed how this institution cuts to the heart 
of the matter and solves problems. The council lasted 13 hours, 
and eight of those hours were spent touring sites to observe the 
actual implementation of the savings program. An important part 
of the program is aimed at achieving self-sufficiency and 
feeding the population. 
  And when Commander of the Revolution Juan Almeida Bosque 
asked several questions to determine the reliability of the 
figures cited, various members of the audience (who were 
attending these meetings for the first time) commented, in 
typical Cuban style, how "they really take off the gloves and 
get down to brass tacks" in these councils. 
  During these stormy times of cynicism when some people are 
so 
materialistic and shortsighted that they have stopped believing 
in true values, in these times of collapsing societies, morally 
destroyed armies, shattered dreams, and forgotten martyrs, what 
Armed Forces could maintain their operations and even expand 
them with scarce resources unless they were forces of the 
people? What Armed Forces could continue to search constantly 
for formulas that allow them to improve the living conditions 
and diet of everyone, unless they were forces of the people? 
  What people, unless they were one and the same as the Armed 
Forces, could continue fighting with such tenacity to maintain 
the country's -- their country's -- defense capabilities, 
cognizant of the fact that the day we become incapable of 
defending ourselves will be the day we will be absorbed, in a 
second, by the eagle that has been coveting us for more than a 
century, but not without first staining the soil of the 
fatherland with the blood of millions of Cubans? 
  The Military Council was not the only extraordinary thing. 
Even more extraordinary was the realization that, in spite of 
all the difficulties, the defense of our children's lives and 
future was guaranteed. The most extraordinary thing has been 
seeing practical examples of all that we can do to maintain 
ourselves and to make progress, even during the Special Period. 
  The most extraordinary thing -- not because we have been 
unaware of the courage of this incredibly extraordinary people, 
but because of the chance to bear witness to it once again -- 
has been seeing even more compelling evidence of the conviction 
that victory lies only with us. Anyone who doubts that should 
go to Unit 1640.

  [Text] On 31 May, the Ernesto Che Guevara Pioneer Center 
hosted the first patriotic-military-internationalist education 
meeting. The meeting served to demonstrate how this education is 
to be conducted at every level. 
  [Begin Brigadier General Nestor Lopez Cuba, director of the 
ideology department of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, 
recording] Almost every organization, in one way or another, 
conducts patriotic-military education. Yet, we believe there is 
still too little and we ought to increase and strengthen it. At 
this pioneers' center, we begin with the children, the youth, 
who we believe should be at the core of this educational effort. 
There is no doubt that although this educational program has 
gaps and problems, we are making a tremendous effort. We have 
conducted this seminar in all three of the Army's regions. We 
are already beginning to expand it to the provinces. Later on, 
it will reach the municipal level and eventually, each defense 
zone. [end recording] 
  The main goals of the patriotic-military education program 
are to promote the study of Cuban history; boost patriotic 
traditions and love for national emblems, heroes, and martyrs; 
and consolidate the ethical-political-ideological value system 
developed by the Revolution.

  The medals were presented to Minint noncommissioned officers 
Misael Valentin Furnier, who is recovering from the gunshots 
received during the operation, and Norberto Duran, as well as 
civilian Arnel Lopez, captain of the hijacked boat. Ensign David 
Antonio Casamayer and soldiers Idilio Vargas, Jose Alexander y 
Sada, Rafael Montero, Giosvani Barrios, and Andres Solano, all 
members of the Border Guard troops, were also presented medals. 
  Juan Carlos Robinson, member of the Central Committee and 
first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in Guantanamo, 
stressed the bravery of the young soldiers and their attitude 
toward those who tried to violate Cuban law.

  [Text] In order to eliminate subsidies, the Sugar Industry 
Ministry is relying on two main paths, production increase and 
cost reduction. This was announced by Ramon Aguila, chief of the 
Ministry's finance department. In order to attain this goal, a 
number of measures are being adopted. These include allocating 
higher amounts of fuel to those tasks directly tied to 
production, such as soil preparation, planting, and sugarcane 
irrigation. Likewise, the scarce resources available will be 
invested in those enterprises and Basic Cooperative Production 
Units where they will yield the most. 
  The Ministry has also adopted a new policy on investment in 
new projects. These will not be undertaken without a preliminary 
financial study.

  [Text] The workers of Hermanos Diaz Oil Refinery are 
working at full speed to repair the damages caused by a fire at 
the refinery in Santiago de Cuba. The quick response of the 
workers prevented the fire from expanding to other areas. The 
fire took place at the catalytic converter plant. 
  [Begin Chief Engineer Ramon Rodriguez recording] The fire 
was 
caused by a leak in a soldering joint of the oxygen tower, 
which, once released, ignited and expanded because the tower 
continued to provide fuel for the fire. The fire spread to 
nearby equipment, particularly the sewers of the catalytic 
converter plant. 
  We believe this fire was not of large or medium magnitude, 
but of small magnitude. We expect to repair the damage in seven 
days, focusing on repairing the mechanical and electronic 
equipment of the butane processing chute. [end recording] 
  Chief Engineer Ramon Rodriguez affirmed that the damage 
caused by the fire is minimal because the workers are trained to 
handle such contingencies.

  [Text] The provincial plenum of the Communist Party of Cuba 
in Matanzas analyzed, as a special point on the agenda, the 
current situation in the province regarding implementation of 
the measures recently approved by the Council of State as well 
as Decree-Law 186, which regulates self-employment violations. 
Osvaldo Umpierrez, president of the Administration Council in 
the province, advised that there are currently 10,227 people 
self-employed, mostly as hairdressers, manicurists, and 
transport cart drivers. 
  Since February when Decree-Law 186 was approved, a 
contingent 
of 231 tax inspectors have imposed over 400 fines, of which more 
than half are against violators from other provinces. Also under 
review is the situation of over 500 automobiles that are not in 
the possession of their owners, 52 of which have been 
confiscated. Additionally, 1,300 motorcycles have been 
inventoried. Currently, in the province, 47 cases of money 
hoarding are being worked on, six of which are now being 
analyzed by the commission created for this purpose.

  [Text] Pinar del Rio Province has held a Communist Party of 
Cuba [PCC] plenum which, among other issues, focused on the 
region's economic prospects. A member of the PCC provincial 
committee presented a detailed analysis of the current situation 
and prospects for the province during the two-day plenum. 
  The plenum stressed the economic results of the first part 
of 
1994, a period during which the province registered modest 
increases in mercantile production. This reflects the beginning 
of the recovery process and how much still needs to be done to 
meet the population's needs. The sugarcane harvest's goal was a 
50-percent increase in 1994, and although more sugar was 
produced than in the previous harvest, and several mills are 
still grinding, this goal will not be reached. Slight increases 
were registered in potato, tomato, and egg production, as well 
as in the harvests of tobacco, pine resin, and self-sufficiency 
crops. 
  The plenum called for increased efforts to quickly reach the 
production level of previous years and insisted on the need for 
more efficiency in collection, especially in the farming sector. 
The fight against crime, and defense issues were also discussed. 
  Fidel Ramos Pereda, member of the Central Committee and 
first 
secretary of the PCC in Pinar del Rio Province, praised the 
frankness with which the issues were discussed, acknowledging 
the modest progress made and the awareness that it is not 
enough, and that the results rest on the efforts of every 
revolutionary.

  [Text] Julian Rizo Alvarez, first secretary of the 
Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] in Camaguey Province, stressed 
during Camaguey's provincial PCC plenum that we are called to 
push forward in a political and ideological offensive, as well 
as embrace all other aspects related to the Revolution. Rizo, a 
Politburo member, went on to point out that the fact that we 
have remained steadfast, without weakening, clearly demonstrates 
that we have triumphed over an unprecedented ordeal. He added 
that now we are ready, and it is our duty, to begin a 
revolutionary offensive. Rizo summed up two days of work that 
had focused on the strategies of scientific development in the 
province. Politburo member Maria de los Angeles Garcia 
considered scientific development in the province to be in an 
advanced stage and in some ways unique in Cuba. 
  With the participation of the provincial PCC plenum members 
and a large number of guest researchers, the first session 
covered the principal scientific programs of production, 
economy, services, and society. To make this project 
crystallize, the people of Camaguey are working on the true 
integration of all aspects of the project, such as a feasibility 
study, by line of work, before commencing a determined 
investigation. 
  During the second day, the plenum was informed about the 
current sugarcane harvest ituation, which was seriously affected 
by rainfall. Over 1,100 mm of rain have fallen on the sugarcane 
fields, which is more than double the amount of rain received 
during the same period last year. The food deficit is critical 
and efforts are being made to solve this problem. The plenum 
also considered the analysis of the workers movement's progress 
report by the assemblies.

    [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 
at 1600 GMT on 1 June features the "Straight Talk" program with 
host Osvaldo Rodriguez and Luis Sexto, both of BOHEMIA magazine. 
  Rodriguez begins by stating that efficiency is not a hollow 
slogan and that the struggle to attain efficiency has barely 
begun. Sexto states that slogans are good for mobilizing the 
masses, but that "in the economy, slogans are harmful. The 
economy is not advanced by slogans because we run the risk of 
their becoming hollow. Slogans can be a mask behind which many 
people hide their lack of effort or efficiency." 
  Sexto stresses that efficiency is vital to all societies and 
to overcoming the dire situation Cuba is experiencing. He adds 
that development is the result of efficiency, and praises the 
Cuban Workers Federation's economic efficiency assemblies' goal 
to motivate every worker. 
  Rodriguez adds: "In order to make efficiency a viable, truly 
attainable goal, the concepts and mechanisms that direct our 
economy must change, the concepts and mechanism that today 
direct our economy." He states that it is important to embark on 
this path with firmness, "ensuring that in the future we will 
not regret having taken this path." 
  Sexto agrees, noting that the current assembly process seeks 
to tap the workers' "subjective reserves" to solve collective 
problems. Sexto also agrees that: "In order to attain efficiency 
in Cuba, certain changes in the economic organization must be 
made. I believe certain principles that have been followed for 
many years must be changed because one way or another, they have 
conditioned our widespread inefficiency. We must admit that Cuba 
has done tremendous work over the past 35 years, but I believe 
that work could have been even greater. I also believe that a 
certain widespread inefficiency has limited that work because 
the model and concepts used to direct our economy promoted 
inefficiency." 
  He goes on to say that only through autonomous management 
will the enterprises become efficient: "...although the word 
autonomy scares many people. These people are those who, today, 
we identify with the bureaucracy, and for whom autonomy 
represents a loss of power." Sexto and Rodriguez agree that it 
is difficult to pinpoint these people because they are people 
who are trying to defend the Revolution, but who go about it the 
wrong way. 
  Sexto again emphasizes the importance of autonomous 
management for achieving efficiency, citing Ranchuelo's Cigar 
Factory as an example. This factory produced the cigars, but did 
not market them. That was done by another enterprise, which owed 
4 million pesos to the factory. The factory, therefore, had to 
seek bank loans to meet its payroll. The marketing enterprise 
had no incentive to quickly pay the factory. 
  Rodriguez focuses on the individual workers' role in 
attaining efficiency. Sexto notes that the worker's existence is 
fully independent from the result of his labor. "You well know 
that in Cuba, the egalitarian concepts that have tried to make 
all workers equal have also created a schism between the worker 
and his labor. Whether the lathe worker does good or bad work, 
his job is not affected. If the factory is unprofitable, his job 
is not affected. He continues to get the same salary. His life 
is not changed." 
  Sexto reiterates that a link must be established between 
performance, and salary or living conditions. Rodriguez agrees, 
noting the example of an enterprise in which a manager did not 
receive a salary for two months because of his inefficient 
performance. Sexto again stresses the importance of the link 
between performance and salary. Rodriguez closes by reiterating 
that efficiency is not a hollow issue.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 1 Jun (AFP) -- The Dominican Republic 
Central Electoral Board (JCE) has agreed to turn over the voter 
lists used in the 16 May general elections -- the opposition's 
main demand. This was confirmed today to AFP by JCE 
spokespersons. 
  The Dominican Republic held presidential, parliamentary, and 
municipal elections 15 days ago, nevertheless a winner has not 
been declared yet due to uncountable charges of fraud. This has 
led the JCE to recount the votes. The opposition parties' main 
charge is that approximately 200,000 persons -- allegedly 
opposed to the official Social Christian Reformist Party of 
President Joaquin Balaguer -- were excluded from the voter lists 
used on election day. 
  The opposition parties demand the JCE show them the lists 
used in the elections to compare them with the ones the board 
delivered to them a few days before the elections. This request 
has just been granted. The JCE decision came about after, in an 
independent manner, the electoral boards of the Puerto Plata and 
the National District [Santo Domingo and its surroundings] 
declared their willingness to turn over their voter lists to the 
parties that requested them. Nevertheless, a JCE spokesperson 
told AFP that the printing and delivery of the voter lists to 
the political parties will take five to six days. 
  According to the count, Balaguer, 87 and almost blind, who 
is 
running for his seventh presidential term, garnered a 1 percent 
lead (30,000 votes) over Jose Francisco Gomez, social democrat 
from the Dominican Revolutionary Party [PRD]. The PRD, which 
charged alleged fraud, insists that the sole solution to the 
post electoral crisis is a partial or total repetition of the 
elections. 
  International observers who watched over the Dominican 
elections have declared the need to verify the number of persons 
who were not able to vote to establish if it was a significant 
enough number that could have altered the results.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 1 Jun (AFP) -- Jose Francisco Pena, 
candidate for the social democratic Dominican Revolutionary 
Party [PRD], demanded new general elections be held after 
denouncing, on Wednesday, that the Central Electoral Board (JCE) 
is preparing a new maneuver in the delivery of the electoral 
lists to the political parties. 
  During a news conference in Santo Domingo, Pena Gomez said 
the maneuver consists of satisfying the demands of the 
opposition parties by giving them a forged voter list with 
200,000 less voters, which obviously does not correspond to the 
electoral list that was used on election day, 16 May. "What 
needs to be done is for the JCE to deliver photocopies of the 
lists used at each of the tables on 16 May," according to Pena 
Gomez and fellow party member Tirso Mejia Ricart, elections 
director of the PRD. These lists can easily be distinguished 
because they are sealed with a mark that states: "voted," 
according to the PRD leaders. 
  Likewise, Pena Gomez said that as part of his party's 
international campaign to denounce the electoral fraud, his 
candidate for vice president, Fernando Alvarez Bogaert, will 
attend the Latin American Foreign Ministers Conference in Belem, 
Brazil, to explain the situation. "The damage caused to 
continental democracy with the shameful events that took place 
during the Dominican election process is serious as can be 
proven by the international observers who attended the 
elections, including the Christian Democrats," Pena Gomez said. 
  While the JCE estimates indicate that President Joaquin 
Balaguer, from the Reformist Social Democratic Party (PRSC), won 
the elections with a 1-percent advantage (30,000 votes) over 
Pena Gomez, his followers maintain that fraud took place to 
ensure the reelection of Balaguer, twice president and seven 
times a candidate. 
  Pena Gomez added that he had received a letter from Costa 
Rican President Jose Maria Figueres informing him that the four 
Central American presidents and their respective foreign 
ministers had agreed to endorse Alvarez Bogaert's participation 
in the conference at Belen, Brazil. The other presidents are 
Carlos Roberto Reina of Honduras, Ramiro de Leon Carpio of 
Guatemala, and Violeta Chamorro of Nicaragua. 
  If Dominican Republic Foreign Minister Aristides Taveras 
Guzman objects to Alvarez Bogaert's participation to report the 
alleged fraud, the Costa Rican foreign minister will present him 
as a member of his delegation, Pena Gomez reported. In this 
respect, the PRD candidate recalled a previous case when during 
Anastasio Somoza's dictatorship in Nicaragua, Father Miguel 
D'Escoto participated in a conference as a member of the Costa 
Rican delegation. 
  Finally, Pena Gomez announced that leaders of his party will 
be sent on other missions. One mission will go to Jamaica to 
request the Caribbean Common Market (Caricom) to not recognize 
the possible proclamation of Balaguer as the newly elected 
president of the Dominican Republic. Another PRD delegation 
will go to the EU to report "the scandalous fraud committed 
against the democratic rights of the Dominican people," he 
concluded. 
  Analysts agree that the post-electoral Dominican panorama 
continues to "be tangled and complicated."

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 1 Jun (AFP) -- It was officially 
announced today that Dante Caputo, the Argentine who is serving 
as UN-OAS special envoy on the Haitian crisis, reached an 
agreement with Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer to send a 
mission that will monitor the observation of the embargo against 
Haiti. Today, Caputo met with President Balaguer in Santo 
Domingo. Following the one-hour meeting, Caputo announced that 
the Dominican Republic will accept a mission "of no more than 60 
people." Caputo and Balaguer also agreed on "a maritime 
cooperation plan to combat contraband going into Haiti." This 
plan will be sponsored by the United Nations. 
  The UN-OAS special envoy said a group of experts will arrive 
in the Dominican Republic next week. They will offer technical 
advice on overseeing the embargo. Caputo also said the UN "will 
encourage its member-states to offer their assistance" to the 
Dominican Republic in monitoring the embargo. 
  In terms of humanitarian aid -- the only type of aid 
permitted under the total UN embargo -- Caputo said that 
tomorrow, Dominican authorities will receive, via the Foreign 
Ministry, "an exact list of what can and cannot be sent across 
the border." 
  The meeting between Caputo and Balaguer also was attended by 
the Dominican Armed Forces chiefs of staff; Leon Fuerth, special 
assistant to U.S. Vice President Al Gore; and Robert Pastorino, 
U.S. ambassador to the Dominican Republic. Caputo, who visited 
the Dominican Republic last week with William Gray, U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's special envoy, must return to New York 
today to meet with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  The Dominican Republic and Haiti share a 300-km border and, 
according to foreign sources, fuel has been crossing into Haiti 
across this border.
